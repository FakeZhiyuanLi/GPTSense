      I used to be an avid viewer of MTV in me early days of college, Nafisa Joseph then was just a passingf face didnt think much about her until today. She is no more as she committed suicide today. Why does a former Miss India, a well known personality, V.J, journalist, socialite, animal acitivist take the drastic step. If someone who has everything can be driven to this then what about the millions of oppressed and downtrodden souls out there... suicide is something that I abhor on account of me religious beliefs and also on account of me pure unadulterated arrogance which will not let me just give up. Nafisa tho you committed the ultimate act of cowardice may your soul rest in peace.

      One of me close friends from Lebanon is back. Met up with him yesterday, Jesus Christ he is crazy as ever. We always have a blast when we are out together.. Yeserday  this crazy s.o.b made me drive like around 500 Kms ( reason for which I will not put up as someday I might publish this blog to me website)...anyways we drove the 500Kms and without success in what he started off for and returned home. But the funny thing is that 500kms in Qatar doesn't seem much. Its a fun drive but in India even 50Kms is kinda tiring.

      I am a very reasonable person but sometimes I don't like to budge from the stance that I take whether it be for better or worse. the thing that I hate the most is ingratitude. If you pay a labour a million bucks today and tomorrow you don't give his overtime, he will stand back and abuse you. Its the labour mentality. Something of the sort happened today. It ended up going to the sponsor of me company, he called me up and asked me what was up and that was the final straw, I told him that I want them cancelled and sent back to their respective countries and will not take em back into the company at any cost, I have full freedom to do what I like and hence these 12 morons who thought they could do what the unions do in India are packed off tomorrow morning. Since the work stoppage was on account of their actions, me won't pay their salaries and deduct the cost of fare from them. Its harsh, its cold hearted... but so be it... someday maybe when I'm more mature hopefully I will develop more compassion.

      Do you know that a ship is always referred to as "she" because it costs so much to keep one in paint and powder. Me was just going to one of me cousin's marriage pics. Won't mention by name but mate I know if you are reading this you will figure out. Anyways, the bride is pretty but why in the hell does she have so much makeup on??.. it made her look ghastly ewww. she was decorated like a statue with how many a K.G of gold lord knows. You know a simple chain with a diamond pendant looks so classy. Brother you should have put your foot down, it was your marriage. Anyways sorry couldn't attend.. good luck and god bless.

      Me forgot to pay the cable bills, it got disconnected yesterday. Since it was an off for momsy she was royally mad at me, was royally blasted by her. Well today I went to pay the bills but the funniest thing happened; at the Al Saad Qtel Office, car parking is hard to come by and especially so if you are on a big offroader like me. Finally I saw a car pull out and went for it, to me surprise another car raced for the same spot at the same time. I wouldnt budge and neither would he and another car pulled inbetween us and took the spot. The same thing happened again. The third time we saw two cars pulling out from the parking lot and  we both got to par. After parking the car, myself and the driver of the other car, a Qatari with whom I had the standoff met up at the entrance of Qtel, thinking of what we had done, all the traffic jam that we caused, we both started laughing loudly. Next time me will go to another Qtel office with car parking space.

      Its a sad day today. Me princess is ill and hence she has a nurse and physio with her. This nurse has been with her for quite some time and was liked by me family and princess herself. But yesterday she took some cash advance from pops and has virtually disappeared. Tsk tsk et tu brute. Pops got a new nurse for me princess but its not the same as she was used to the old one. Pops is like since no harm is done.. let it be... forget the old one. But me can't forgive or forget. I place loyalty over everything else, I am as loyal as a dog and I expect the same from those I trust. Right now being in the middle east I can't do much. But once I get back to India the days of this nurse is numbered.

      Hmmm.. me wants to keep an updated online journal but alas time is of the essence and hence am unable to do so. Have been losing momentum in this regard, havent updated in a while but am back. Once you lose the flow I know I will not come back to update it. This week has been very hectic and hence was pressed for time. Hope me able to update frequently. Have always wanted to maintain a journal but a pen and diary aint for me. Since me comfy with computers I guess this is the next best alternative.

      Me mom back from a vacation to India.... she had a shock the moment she entered the house.. it was a mess, everything was upside down. You know when a female is there in the house, you don't appreciate the work they do. It looks like they are doing nothing, picking up and folding a cloth ot two, dusting for a min  and thats it. With mom gone, the house was a mess and realized that household chores are demanding as well. She is back at making the house look inhabitable by humans ;-)

      Business acumen is something that I was born with, add to it the killer instinct and the belief that alls fair in business makes me a very shrewd business man. But sometimes I do feel a little remorse for the decisions that I take which are for my company's and my personal welfare and detrimental to others. I mention this as someday I would like to once again look back and apologize to one M/S G...... S.... , I know what I am doing will eventually run them out of business and that its not warranted but I have to look out for my company cannot show any compassion. But for what its worth I know what I'm doing is wrong but I will be doing it again tomorrow... sorry.

      Me been a long time supporter of Liverpool F.C, the last few years under the management of Gerard Houllier has been disastrous for us, no silverware last year at all. Now we have a new boss and under his regiime I hope the kop will regain lost glory. New signings like Djibril Cisse should take us to the top again. Liverpool "you will never walk alone"   The Liverpool Anthem -  When you walk through a storm Hold your head up high, And don't be afraid of the dark. At the end of a storm, There's a golden sky, And the sweet silver song of a lark. Walk on through the wind, Walk on through the rain, Though your dreams be tossed and blown... Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart, And you'll never walk alone... You'll never walk alone. Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart, And you'll never walk alone... You'll never walk alone

      Kalpana Chawla, the Indian born American astronaut who perished in the space shuttle Columbia disaster is looked upon as an idol in me homeland i.e. India.. and I can't for heavens sake fathom why??? why is she being held high as an "Indian".. she is NOT an Indian, yes she was born an Indian but when she pledged allegiance to the U.S.A she forsook her Indian heritage, so for me she is another american astronaut who passed away in the disaster and my feelings for her demise are similar to those of the other crew members onboard the shuttle. So the next newspaper article I see about "our valiant kalpana" me gonna burn em papers.. grrrr.

      Morgan Stanley, the world's second-biggest securities firm, has agreed to pay $54 million to settle a sex-bias suit, said a New York Times report.Allison Schieffelin, 42, a former bond saleswoman whose 1998 complaint to the EEOC led to the sex-bias suit against Morgan Stanley, is set to obtain $12 million from the settlement.  I'm definitely against sexual harassment of all kinds but I feel there is an increasing tendancy of misusing the priviliges of being a lady. If someone acts rough with you, tell him to take a hike, sue him for actualy damages. What warrants a 12 mil damage suit and that too for a bond sales woman.  Another disturbing factor nowadays is "kiss and tell", easiest way to make money is to sleep with someone famous and then write a book a about it, go on talk shows a la Rebecca Loos et al.   On the same note I also hate feminists who say men demean women by depicting them in skimpy clothes in movies.. ahem one question if it is so demeaning then why are the women in the flicks doing it????.. its all about the money honey.. all about the money.

      This years Laureus sports awards of the year was complete bull... for e.g the sportswoman of the year went to some dumb golf broad and to think that the other nominees were Maria Motola, Inge Bruun etc and a golfer won??? lord have mercy.. same goes for the newcomer of the year, one 14 year old female golfer was named the newcomer of the year and the other notable nominees like Lebron James, Maria Sharpova lost out. Whats with Laureus Academey and golf.. for heavens sake its a horrible sport... or is there a hidden agenda.

      I'm totally glued to me cellphone, spend a lot of time on it daily. Since me company foots me bill well I use it for work and me personal use ... I bought me current phone the SonyEricsson T610 around 6 months back and I just checked the total hours I've used it.. its a staggering 721 hours.. Jesus Christ I hope that me phone emits only a low level of radiation.... actually the claims of corelation between excessive phone use and cancer is not proven but the thought just scares me now... I would say that I'm a prime candidate for a thorough study on the same.. any takers???

      Well I just came across a huge accident and it struck my mind that I too am driving at dangerously high speeds and one day it too might bring about the end of me. My average speed is 140 KMH and I am very comfortable at that speed. Anything lower and I feel that I am crawling at a snails pace. I don't think I will be able to reduce me speeds much, speed kills but what the hell it sure thrills. As long as I live I live life like the king that I am.

      This is something that I feel strongly about... day in and day out we are now bombarded with the beckam scandals and I'm wondering why??... why is there such a high rate of infidelity in the world compartively to years of yore. Isn't marriage supposed to be sacred? I abhor the utter disdain with which the sanctity of marriage is treated in the western world, this is one reason that I'm still glad to be of Indian origin atleast the culture is still imbibed in most of us but have to admit that our culture is also being influenced heavily by the west as can be witnessed with the sprouting of numerous swingers club in the metros of India.

It was saddening to know that he was 11 million under debt. How come there is no financial planning in Hollywood.Anyways may his soul rest in peace.

      Ouch I forgot to pay me phone bills again, this time around its me cellular bills rather than the landline one. I actually didnt forget to pay, I think I kinda crossed me credit limit. My credit limit is pegged at around Qatari Riyals 2000 and everytime I cross the limit me phone gets cut. only half of the month is over and me already crossed 2000 bucks. I have two GSM numbers just in case the primary one is disconnected so no harm done, I think me will use the secondary number for a few days before paying the first bill. 2000 bucks already and with half of the month still left, Jesus Christ I think this month I will average around 5000 Qatari Riyals or circa $1400... I guess I am high maintenance for me company... but then again quality comes at a price baby!!

Liverpool F.C me am with ya.. now lets sign Alonso, Aimar and Collocini and lets go for glory. Hell yeah. LFC - You will never walk alone.

But one thing that discerns me is that whatever it be it eventually ends up on me  urlLink homepage  and I'm debating whether something as personal as this, my thoughts be published for the whole world to read. But then again there ain't much personal stuff on in these blogs, am very wary of adding it to the blogs; so I guess it wouldn't be harmful to publish me blogs to me website as well.

My question is hey its your dad after all, so why take him to court. He raised you bought you up to the point where you are able to make so much money. So let it be... If anyone else had swindled you then shoot to kill baby... But pops?? naaah!!!.... Don't sue him, just don't talk to him anymore and you should take care of your own finances... Its not like its the end of the world.

      The Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)  Essential Feature   The essential feature of the narcissistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy (DSM-IV?, 1994, p. 658). Gunderson, et.al, (Livesly, ed., 1995, p. 208) notes that the grandiosity may not be overt or may involve arrogant and haughty behavior.  Sometimes I do get the feeling that I suffer from NPD. But then again a true narcissist will not feel that he suffers from anything. But I do have to accept that I have what psychologists call "Healthy Narcissism".  Pathological Narcissism is a disease whereas healthy narcissism is a gift. Narcissists are obsessed by delusions of fantastic grandeur and superiority. As a result they are very competitive. They are strongly compelled - where others are merely motivated. They are driven, relentless, tireless, and ruthless. They often make it to the top. But even when they do not - they strive and fight and learn and climb and create and think and devise and design and conspire. Faced with a challenge - they are likely to do better than non-narcissists.   Pathological narcissism involves an impaired, dysfunctional, immature (true) self coupled with a compensatory fiction (the False Self). The sick narcissists sense of self-worth and self-esteem derive entirely from audience feedback. The narcissist has no self-esteem or self-worth of his own (no such ego functions). In the absence of observers, the narcissist shrivels to non-existence and feels dead. Hence the narcissists preying habits in his constant pursuit of narcissistic supply. Pathological narcissism is an addictive behaviour.  Almost everyone has some narcissistic traits, but being conceited, argumentative, or selfish sometimes (or even all the time) doesn't amount to a personality disorder. Narcissistic Personality Disorder is a long-term pattern of abnormal thinking, feeling, and behavior in many different situations.

      I don't smoke or booze and hence I don't have expenses related to the same. My  company foots my internet, mobile and fuel bills which leaves me with just food expenses. But call me a snob, call me a narcissist; I only dine at good restaurants.... hell will freeze over before I go to some low class blue collar joint. Now that me on a strict diet, me don't have lunch at all and dinner I come home and have. The bottom line is that now I don't have any expenses and for one of the few times I have more money than I can spend... muahhahahaha (evil laugh)....

      Me went jogging for around 2 hours today at the corniche here, me now in full swing to get back in shape. When I started working out a few years back I was only interested in getting a bulky physique, which was easy.. toning it and maintaining it seems to be much much harder... the problem with weight training is that once you stop all the bulk that you put on just loosens up as is the case with me now. Even now I still have that broad shoulders, well built chest but without regular excercise for the past 3 years plus me waistline is on an expansion spree which I will put a stop too. One of the advantages of working out since childhood is that my muscles are already accustomed to weight training and hence I don't feel that sore and pain that newcomers to the sport feel. This is day four... approx six months more to see if I am successfull or not.

      Am 25 right now and at the prime of me life, one of the eligible bachelors in town. Have been single till now mainly on account of the fact of me fear of commitments. Its not fear of commitments rather its the fear of falling out of it. I am a very loyal person and I don't commit easily as I fear that if it doesn't work out I will not be able to put the pieces back together.  But the time is near when I will have to finally commit.. maybe not now..maybe in a year, a year and a half who knows. But will I find the right girl. The kinda girl I want is the "girl next door" who also happens to be classy and sophisticated and also sweet and homely. I have a feeling that this is impossible. If a girl is sweet and homely they usually tend to be dumb; if classy and sophisticated they will be more arrogant than me and thats not acceptable. The kind of girl I want is next to impossible to find.. so as I always say if I can't find the kind of girl I want why not the type of car I want...hahhha.. .so me will most probably have to find a good looking girl with a Mercedes... preferably the S Class...

      I don't know if its whether I have not matured  or if the show has matured since I was a kid but the bottomline is that I still love it and find it very funny. Its very sarcastic and bloody whacky. Gross at times have to admit but most of the time bordering on insanity with a humane touch to it... Me 25 and still love it.. and hey balls to anyone who thinks that a grownup can't like cartoons.Matt Groening has done an excellent job with the characters... Another cartoon that I still watch sometimes and appreciate is Johnny Bravo.. he is one real cute guy have to admit... does have that small touch of my Narcissistic quality.

      I get a lot of stick for this but one of me strongest beliefs is that reservations of all kinds should be done away with. In me homeland the reservation system is just horrible. There is reservation for lower castes, women, this that who knows maybe even the owner of a one eyed dog for all I know.  If after 50 years of independence, reservations for over a 50 years the lower castes are still backward then I feel the reservation system is pointless. Jobs etc should go to the most efficient candidate not based on ones caste or creed or gender for that matter. Talking about reservations for women is another dicey topic.. aren't women equal to men?... then why the reservations? Its high time we did away with reservations of all kinds.

      August the 3rd, 2004 and me back on a strict workout regimen. Its been almost 3 years since I've seen the inside of a gym and it most definitely has taken a toll on me physique. I have given myself 6 months to get better toned than before and hopefully I will achieve it.... also of importance is the fact that this time around I will be using a few supplements to achieve success faster. I just hope I get the time to do what I want as my work is very hectic and I really don't have time even for sleeping.. but this time around me am adamant and will find the time somehow.
