      Why would anyone want to read this blog that doesn't know me? IN fact, why would anyone who knows me even want to read this blog? I'm not  TRYING  to be grammatically correct, I'm not trying to impress anyone with my writing skills (Hi Tommy), and I'm certainly not trying to be interesting. Everything I write on here is stream of consciousness. So all you New York Times book reviewers who feel it's necessary to comment on my writing skills, go back to grading AP English exams---I AIN'T INTERESTED.    Sorry--that time of the month.

      My friend TTP's girlfriend has no sense of smell.  It is so odd to me, she claims that she can still taste, but I don't believe her.  She can't tell the difference between different flavored jelly-bellies, and those CLEARLY have different flavors (buttered popcorn-ggaaaaaaaggggggggg).  One time, we were waiting to eat at a restaurant, and we were all starved, so I turned to her and said, "Well, at least it smells good!"  And she replied, "Oh...does it??" WOOOOPSIES!! I totally forgot!! MAN, what an a-hole.  It's great for TTP though--bad breath, smelly farts, B.O., he doesn't have to worry about sh*t (no pun intended).  I guess there is some surgery that she can have on her olfactory nerves, that could get her a sense of smell, but she's scared of overstimulation (just like Val Kilmer in that horrid movie where he has sight for the first time).  The funniest part about the whole thing though, is that she was growing up she thought "smell" was something that you got when you went through puberty. AAAAAAAAAAAh-hahha.

      I love my new best friends (Josh's niece and nephew), Christopher and Kasey.  Christopher is four, and Kasey is seven. They are such little diehards, they crack me up.  At Christopher's Chuck E. Cheese Birthday party, all the other kids were all googley-eyed for the big rat walking around (aka Chuck E.), but when he came over to Christopher to wish him a Happy Birthday, Christopher wanted none of it and punched him right in his rat face.  I could tell the guy playing Chuck E. really respected him for it, because he probably wanted to punch himself for having to wear that godawful thing for a living. Also, one time Kasey told me that she thought her and I were identical twins.  Then she asked me, "Do you like chicken noodle soup and smiley faces??" When I said yes, she replied, "Okay. Yes, we are definitely twins."  What the??? Aaaaaaw al;sjdf.

      Welp, it's nearing that time where I'm counting down the days 'til my next paycheck (again)...I'm broke as a joke!  I've had so much work lately, that they even hired me a temp to help me out...I'm moving up in the world--you'd think I wouldn't have to live paycheck to paycheck.  Anybody understand my pain (HI MATT!)?  Speaking of Matt, my brother always makes me feel better when I come into some tough times like this.  Our IM conversations usually go as such:   awerns:  Matt, check this out: Total Deposits: $12.54  mjwern:  a;lsjfasd Total deposits: $1.35  The Werner kids are s-t-rugglin.  Thanks for all the college loans mom and dad!!! asl;kjfsal;f Sorry, cancerous mole, cancerous mole...  With all that said, might go to Happy Hour tonight??

      I was picking up a few things at Safeway the other day (Monday to be exact), and I was in the check-out line, when I noticed the guy in front of me.  First of all, let me just preface by saying that while living in a city, it is inevitable to encounter (daily) people who are messed up in the head (Hi Vanessa!! Same hand!!!).  I think there is actually a "crazy" scale, that people generally fall into, ranging from "not quite right" to "completely and totally incapable of normal human contact".  Well, I knew immediately that the guy in front of me was "slighty off".  He was an older white male, probably around 60 years old.  I could feel him staring at me, and he had a crazy kind of look in his eye.  I thought to myself, 'Oh, there is no doubt in my mind that this guy is going to say something totally weird to me'.  Sure enough, as I started putting all my food down on the checkout counter, he starts serenading me: "SOoooomeboooody doesn't like to cook!! That sooooooomeboody is YOU!!!" So I sung back, "Sooomeboooody is completely F-ed in the head!!! That soooomeboooooooody is you!!"  a;lsdfjka.  Well, it came out more like "That's not true", and I quickly put on my headphones.  Anybody who knows me knows that I make a mean breaded chicken breast and lipton sides pasta mix (Hi Xty and Julia!);ajsdf.

      After coming to terms with what my biggest fear is, and after revealing that fear to the...5 people that read this al;skjf, what do I see when I turn on the TV last night?? Yeah, that's right: ERIC STOLTZ IN MASK ;ldjf. I was working out at the gym, flipping through the channels on my little personal video screen, when GOOD LORD that face jumped out at me like a bad out of hell.  GOD DAMN, I had just gotten it out of my head, and now it's back.  GOOD LORD...WHAT A FACE! asdfj Why does the Women's Entertainment channel have to do that to me??I decided that the freakiest part of that movie (yes, I have sat through it all) is when Rocky (Stoltz) is at that carnival looking into the funhouse mirrors.  While the mirrors distort everyone else's faces, they transoform his already distorted face into something of a somewhat normal appearance. POWERFUL(ly SCARY).

      I just went to the bathroom here, and there was a little person at the sink!! I was completely caught off guard, I've never seen a little person in the office before.  I stepped back in alarm, just because I couldn't believe what I was seeing--and I think she totally noticed!! Man, I'm such a jerk.  This just reinforces my theory that I am coming back in my next life as a cancerous mole.

      The fact that it's Monday afternoon, and the fact that I've gotten some negative feedback on the blog from Pedophiliac family members(how's Hermione Grangier MJW???) has left me a little jaded and uninspired, which accounts for the slow day and recent deletions.    There's some guy in my office whose only job (it seems) is to walk around the office and keep a tally of who is at their desks and who isn't.  Seeing as I've only noticed him doing this a few times (and I've heard he does it daily), leads me to believe that he has me on the "never at desk" list--pissed!! I'm always at my desk, but I've had an overactive bladder lately and that's just not my fault (I think I have the 'gotta go gotta go gotta go right now!' disorder--more on that later).  I saw him stationed at some woman's cube today, and he was just standing there, staring at her desk and writing things down at a rapid pace on his ratty little note pad--what the hell could he possibly be writing down on that little thing?!?! It's all very suspect, and I plan to get a hold that pad--as soon as I find out where he sits ;ljasdf.  Maybe he  doesn't  have to walk around with that pad as part of his job, but he just does it to make neurotic people like me freak out and feel awkward.  In that case, I gotta give him credit a;slj.  Otherwise, I think he was the runt of the litter kid who got bullied in grade school, but got back at everyone by being the hall monitor and giving them all detentions (see Saved by the Bell episode #76).

      I went to Chuck E. Cheese last weekend, right after the Goat play.  I hadn't been to Chuck E Cheese's in yeeeahs! Good times! I was there for Josh's nephew's 4th bday party, but I decided to walk around by myself for a while to see what new games are out there.  I also decided to try and make some new friends while I was at it (seeing as Josh was occupied with the Star Wars video game that he wasted about 20398423098 tokens on).  There was this little Asian girl (who I'll call Ming-La) who intrigued me, so I followed little Mingie around for a while.  We were having a great time, but then she got too ADD on me and I couldn't keep up (not to mention Ming-La's dad, Chungsook (asjkf sorry), started to give me some puzzled looks).  I quickly became engaged in my all time favorite Chuck E. Cheese game, Skee Ball.  You really can't go wrong with that, fun for all ages.  Everything was fine until this little Indian kid next to me (probably aged 5 years), who I'll call Deepak, stole one of my tokens! I reacted immediately with, "HEY, that is  MY  TOKEN!"  I guess I forgot how much bigger and scarier I was, b/c little Deepak looked like he was about to drop a BM in his underoos (and very well may have).  I quickly gained my composure, apologized, and  Deepak quickly got over it (kids are resilient lkasj).  To make up for it, he handed me one of his skee balls so I could have an extra turn.  Way to go Deeps, our future is looking bright al;jdsf.

      I have a staff retreat starting tomorrow.  It starts out with a dinner/dancing cruise (oy vay), and will lead into an 8 hour work day that includes only bonding games and ice-breakers.  I can't tell if I love that kind of stuff, or hate it.  I think I hate it (who am I kidding, I secretly love it).  I don't think I need to know my coworkers any better.  I consider myself to be a personality expert, so I already know them better than they could ever imagine.  I suspect that the whole day will end with eveyrone saying, "We are such a great team, I love you all!" and getting all dusty.  Then, two days later, we will all go back to not speaking and secretly getting on each others nerves again. They all bore me.  a;dlfj.  This blog bores me, I got nuthin again asdf.

      about the blog.  I think it calms me to know that nobody will be reading this.  I hope I don't make my blog too flowery or wordy (sorry tommy), I also hope I don't steal too much from mjwern.  I still feel like the younger sibling who is trying to be just like her older brother (I should have higher aspirations maybe? ;;jsklj).  I went to Philly this weekend with my boyfriend, Josh, and my mom (Momwern).  We saw a play that my cousin is starring in.  It's about a guy (who plays the father to my cousin) who falls in love with a Goat.  My mom's interpretation of the play: " I think that it is a piece that shows the loneliness and desperation of a man who will reach out to anything (the goat) to feel loved ".  My interpretation: " Maybe they (the dad and goat) really had something special ?"  I wrapped up the evening by sleeping in a hotel room with my boyfriend and mother.  Me and boyfriend in one bed, mother in the other.  As if watching a whole play about a guy F-ing a goat wasn't awkward enough, jesus.

      Looks like we have a concensus that Ashlee Simpson is cute, I guess I'll agree with that.   Had a VERY vivid dream last night that I was on Last Comic Standing myself.  The audience seemed to love me, but when I got offstage, all the other contestants said I sucked. I can remember some of my material...pretty brutal stuff asdfsdf.  Speaking of brutal, had some chicken frie rie for lunch, and am currently experiencing some of the worst heartburn known to man.    Just entered myself in the PCH sweepstakes...yah baby!! Who's gonna be the big winner?!?!?! Why is it that 80 year old women alwasy seem to win? They're all about to die anyways...what a waste.

      Two days ago I saw a little person, a black albino, and the guy from Mask on TV (AGAIN) all in a 3 hour time span.    Today I was crossing the street after I picked up my lunch (Subway Italian BMT Six Inch sandwich on honey oat als;kj), and my heel got caught in a man hole.  I was in the middle of the crosswalk and tried to casually remove it, but was unsuccessful.  I had to take my foot out of my shoe, bend down and remove the shoe from the manhole as quickly as possible as to not get run over (anyone who knows me knows I'm scared to cross the street as it is--hi Josh :).  Then, some dbag bald guy yelled out, "Not a good place to lose your shoe, eh?" At which point I yelled back, "Not a good place to lose your hair, eh?" a;lsdjf.  Not really, I'm not that quick.  Why do I always think of insults about five minutes after the fact? as;ldfj;asdf. I need some libations (dictionary.com word of the day 7/14/04).  Gary Gulman and Jay London head to head last night on Last Comic Standing. Gary Gulman wins again--he is coming up strong!  Is Ashlee Simpson cute? I can't decide.

      So I had my annual check-up at the Gyno this morning.  I won't get too personal because it's none of your damn business, but I am happy to report a clean bill of health!! I love my gyno, she's so nice.  She's pretty, soft-spoken, and has nice strawberry blonde hair.  Last time I went, my feet smelled really badly, and she didn't even say anything! I greatly appreciated that, because lord knows she could smell them (they were right in her face al;sjdf sorry).  This doctor's office is confusing though, because when you step off the elevator, you walk directly into a long hallway.  The waiting room is  NOT  clearly marked, so the last time I went I just picked a door (fingers crossed) and walked right in on a girl getting her papshmere.  Good lord.

       "7 comics left, who is the funniest?!"   I have a newfound love of the reality show, "Last Comic Standing".  I can't stand the guy who got kicked off last night: SEEYA ANT.  Gary Gulman all the way--he's not  that  funny, but he's my hometown favorite.  He's got that football player/jewish thing going on, which is a rare find.  I also like Corey Holkum, although he has been weak lately.  John Heffron is great too, but I get annoyed when he changes his voice when he performs---what's up with that?  That Kathleen Madigan chick is the dark horse in the group.  How come nobody wants to challenge her? I've seen her "bit", it ain't that great.  I feel like she's a mole of some sort...everyone seems to know her from somewhere...suspect.  Does anybody know what I'm talking about? Do I know what I'm talking about? Didn't think so.

      I'm back from my brief hiatus caused by all-day meetings, and the holiday weekend.  Spent fourth of July weekend in Dewey Beach, DE. Was it a fun time? Sure.  Will I ever go on vacation with thirteen people again? Doubtful.  Drunken hook-ups, drunken dramatic outbursts, drunken ex-male strippers from Louisiana with the inability to "not-talk"...that's fun if there is some sort of confessional room involved. With all that said, can we reserve the place now for next year (sike)?  Nah, in all seriousness, it was a decent (and most memorable) time.  I'm glad I went.   Back in the swing of things now...this workday's passing like molasses in wintertime...and it's July.  Pouuuuuuur me something tall and strong!

      WHO IS THE FUNNIEST??  We will find out tonight!  Apparently, unbeknownst to me (until now), my father has connections to Gary Gulman (from LCS).  His friend from work is apparently besties with Gary and is even going to his (Gary's) LCS party tonight.  IN ADDITION...she (dadwerns' co-worker) even got my dad to log in to nbc.com and vote for Gary Gulman.  Anyone who knows my dad can get a kick out of  him taking the time to vote for someone on a reality tv show.  Very un-dadwerns like.  Speaking of which, it's his Birthday today.  Happy Birthday Dadwerns!

      There is a movie being filmed in my neighborhood, and there are some pretty big names associated with it (MD, GC, you get the idea).  I was all primed to have some big celeb sightings, but I have to be honest; the most intriguing thing I've seen is that craft service table.  Yowser there's a lot of food over there, must be nice ;alsdjf.  I need to be in Hollywood.

      I swear to God, the metro train conductor on my way to work this morning was a sex-line phone operator.  "Pleeeaaase staaand back (moan), dooors are cloooooooooosing (moan)".  It was weird, her voice was all breathy and she was talking really slowly; you could  tell  she was trying to sound sexy.  Maybe she is trying to be discovered.  Maybe she has her own 900 number, 1-900-Rail-Me (I should be punched in the face for that joke).

      So I know that I've talked up Gary Gulman in a past post, as he is the hometown favorite jew-boy from Last Comic Standing (I'm half-Jewish for the record, so I'm allowed to say "jew-boy"), but I must admit that his stand up routine is amateurish and unoriginal (still funny though), thus making me ENRAGED that he was voted into the final three over Kathleen Madigan.  I think the fact nobody wanted to go head-to-head with her (and after her routine on Tuesday, I can see why) may have hurt her in the end, b/c the American audience didn't know her as well, thus they were not as inclined to call up and vote (for her).   I used to think that Gulman was really appealing, but I see him getting progressively more arrogant, and I think that his comedy just isn't as smart as Hefrron's, Elonzo's, or Kathleen's.  I mean you can only have so many jokes about cookies and oreos--CHRIST!!!  Anybody know what I"m talking about?  Anybody care? Didn't think so las;jfd.  I think I could literally talk about LCS for hours...I got problems.

      I like the way that feels!!  Well, I've officially jumped on the Ashlee Simpson band-wagon.  I watched the Ashlee Simpson show marathon all last Saturday on MTV, and she definitely grew on me.  I like her "fiery" and "blunt" personality.  I also noticed that her parents yell at her a lot more than Jessica, which as the more rebellious younger sibling, I can most definitely empathize with.  Also, I think her tunes are kind of catchy, and they've been in my head continuously since I watched those episodes.  In fact, one might say it's sort of annoying...I just can't seem to stop singing them inside my brain.   I remember in fourth grade once I couldn't get to sleep because I had a song in my head ( think it was DO-A DIDDY DIDDY DUM DIDDY DOO!!), and once I had finally gotten to sleep/gotten it out of my head, I woke up to my brother shouting the song in my face thus starting the cycle all over again.  Did that really happen MJ or was it a dream I had?  I'm pretty sure it really happened.
