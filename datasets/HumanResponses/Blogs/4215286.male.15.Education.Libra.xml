        I promised Mony that I'd compose this list so here it goes...  1. Pens... you gotta have the smoothest pen to write with throughout the whole year and of course I rely on my trusty Uni-ball Roller Grip for that. $16 for a dozen and every penny is worth it.        Of course, it has to be redesigned for the new school year. hehe  2. Wite out... Look at BIC and no one else. Buy 1 Get 1 Free w/ Mail In rebate for $4        3. Now for pencils, there is nothing like the Paper-Mate ClearPoint Mechanical Pencil. It has a nice grip and a decent sized eraser. Buy 2 packs of 2 and one pack free. Each pack costs $2.         4. After pampering the hand, you need your binder. I got the Storex Poly Binder-Organizer. It has a 1 1/2" ring with 8 plastic divders and a portfolio pouch in the back. Though I wanted the 1/2' Avery Poly Binder, I'm ok with this. Staples didn't have the one I wanted. =( (Sorry no photograph)  5. Who can forget about Post-Its? Everyone loves them.           6. As you all know I have all the new gadgets and stuff. To add on to my arsenal of my hp IPAQ h5555, Canon Powershot S50, my lousy Sony Ericsson T616 (I WANT A SAMSUNG FLIP PHONE GRRR), and my TI-83 Plus Silver Edition, I got a TI-89 Titanium when it first came out this summer. I got it for $130 and I'm selling my TI-83 Plus Silver Edition.            That's all folks.

        I just hate that I am such a coward at many times. If someone holds a knife at my throat, I'd doubt that I would fight back no matter how much I say to myself I would. I would most probably be just caught up with the moment. There are just somethings you can only gain from experience and I have had a fair share of them. I am literally spoiled. I have a iPAQ (~$560), a powershot S50 (~$480), and a cell that I put no value on. These three things I always carry around. Sometimes, I just wish I could trade places and experience what it feels like to be not as privileged. That experience sound knock some sense into me. I don't want everything to be given to me on a silver platter. I want to just be out there in the real world. I want to be a survivor such as like you can throw me in any place or situation and I'll live through it.  ---------------------  Some other thoughts...  As I mentioned before, I am a coward. I get things half done and then do not have the guts to finish what I set myself out to do. In fact, the person who this pertains to especially doesn't even know of my blog. All the better, I just have a false sense of security. I just dream every night and wish I could just pick up that phone and ask. I just worry about stupid consequences and bad lingering memories of the past just always hold me in chains. Happiness just lies around the corner but I am too afraid to go for it. I walk until the final block and wait for a miracle or just wonder when will I be ready to cross that final block.

        I finally went on Back to School shopping.  It was funny looking at what cool new designs are out there to draw people into buying the product.  This year, the total was $67 plus $5 off with some rebates.  All I have left to buy is looseleaf paper.  Staples currently has it for 47 cents.  I am waiting for the second week of September.  That is when it drops to 13-17 cents for 200 sheets.

        I had my lousy annual check-up today.  I just hate them because there is always something that turns out to be wrong with me.  I got lectured by my doctor on drugs, sex, and the other usual yadda yadda.  Do I look as I would do that stuff?  There is no trust these days.  My parents would trust me with their credit cards but not with these kinda things.  I fasted for nothing since my dad thought lab work was done at the doctor's office.  Instead, I have to go to Quest and get it done there. How lovely!  When I got home, my mom was blurting out my medical history and shit to my relatives.  That pissed me off and I ended up threatening to reveal her history since I was not in a good mood at all.  Now I am just bored and annoyed to hell for no apparent reason.  My dormant temper is flaring up lately.  So I am sorry in advance if I tick anybody off.  Later, -Z

        We watched Yu-Gi-Oh! when I was volunteering today at YAI.  It wasn't bad but the thing that sucked was that I had to restrain a kid during the end of the movie.  He was kicking around and getting off his seat periodically.  Kids are just so energetic and this one thinks that I'm not a counselor.      That just wore me out completely.  The rest of the day I just played around with the kids and eventually fell asleep until it was time for the parents to pick up the kids.  Now I received this interesting comment on my last post...  "   Meh...since when was discontinuing a xanga a "cool act" to do? It's reached the same level as having sex for the first time, or the first kiss or whatever.      Oh well, hope you are enjoying your summer.      - common_cents     "  Uh... I never said that it was a cool thing nor did I make a big thing out of it either.  In any case, it has not reached the level of having your first kiss or having sex the first time. ... At least, I don't think so. lol  Personally, I think those two things are a hell lot better than this blog. ;-)  Speaking of kissing, is there anyone that could teach me how to french kiss? lol jk

        I finally got out of the house... yay (I know I sound quite pathetic)  I went to Forest HIlls to see I, Robot with Jennifer, Karuna, and Sandy. Too bad Mony and Zoya couldn't come... I guess they were expendible. hehe  It was good except the beginning where I saw Will Smith's naked ass. Then, I thought I should have taken my chances with A Cinderella Story instead. (I hate Hillary Duff... period!) However, aside from that, it was awesome. I liked that robot named Sunny and that Audi.  We all enjoyed and then I had my long 2 1/2 hour ride home.  __________  On a side note, I am sorry Cass for canceling on you two days ago. I thought it was gonna rain heavily on thursday (grumbles at the weather forecast). I'll make it up to you.

        Everyday there are new things to encounter.  Some pleasant... others are everything but normal.  Some mornings I find myself disoriented because I feel as though I grew a few inches overnight and others I just lay in bed limp as I was a old, worn teddy bear.  My relatives came from Bangladesh.  There are 7 of them.  Yes,  seven  of them.  They are all cool and all.  However, I feel as though my life isn't about myself anymore.  It feels like as if my life is just consequences of everyone else's actions but my own.  My house gets crazy at times... try most of the time actually.  Phone has been ringing on and off.  TIme has no regard for me and I realize 3/4ths of my summer vacation has already expired.  When was the last time I enjoyed a day outside?  Hmm... some day in July, I guess.  My life is everything but anything to enjoy.  So many things are put upon my shoulders.  I guess I know how it feels like to be my mom.  You need to get everything done and you have no time for yourself.  At least, all that I had to do is done.  I spent a stupid 3 weeks on it.  Now, I finally  can do what I need to do for myself.  That is enjoy, eat, relax, and sleep.  Oh yeah I forgot... SAT prep. ::grumbles::

        Finally something plain simple and not crap like xanga...  This is my blog without the word "xanga" plastered all over it.  Hopefully, I'll make good use of this blog.
