      once there was a time when all there was to life was working, partying, and feeding my two cats.  one husband, one dog, and two home-ownerships later, marriage has altered me a little . . . or perhaps simply polished facets of self i never knew i had!  i remain very much my self - imaginative, flirty, creative, thoughtful, outrageous, kind, curious.  i still enjoy partying, just not as often as i used to, and i still enjoy playing dress up, much to the husband's delight ;)  i still believe a lipstick or new hair colour = therapy.    new additions to the list of things i enjoy:  my new dryer  (no, really, it's LOVELY!)  my $279 vacuum cleaner  (after 12 years of denial and almost as many sorry-ass $60     attempts to avoid buying it, i gave in.  and yes, they are definitely worth it.  i think i could pick up my 115 lb dog with it if i wanted to!)  sheers   a not-so-new addition to this list is my love of power tools.  the great thing about marriage/homeownership is that i seem to have more opportunities to indulge!  i got a new ryobi drill from the inlaws for christmas, and today i screwed everything from drapery rods to shoe racks! (how kinky is that!)  being "handy" makes me feel so freakin' sexy! double entendre abounds when you're fiddling with power tools . . .  *sigh*  one more domestic goddess activity this weekend: i bought a spring-form pan and intend to make a vegetable cheesecake.  will share the recipe if it's a winner.

      remember the slacking pig i mentioned in an earlier missive?  *WELL!* i found the cajones to go ahead and say "you're cramping my style."  i was going to do it face-to-face (hate confrontation, but prefer to address nasty things directly so as to cut the duration of the confrontation to a minimum) but time did not permit and so i ended up emailing three brief paragraphs.  i figured i had nothing to lose (contracts being up in the air and all) and that he'd either respond with "bitch, please"  or  go ahead and attempt to foster professional rapport.  he not only apologized for being a pain-in-the-ass, he promised improvement!  this exceeded my expectations and made my freakin' day.  everyone loves a return on investment!  other things that made my week: lunch on the bosses' dime, finding not one but three fun new bargains at the tj maxx, four pints on thursday night, and the arrival of the weekend.  oh, and i'm just pages away from finishing the book i've got to finish before delving into daniel brown's da vinci code . . . i can't wait!  thanks for reading (and for the times you talk back - i appreciate it!)

      i'm totally NOT into that daytime talk show sob story stuf, but i must confess i do enjoy the random acts of kindness bit and sincerely appreciate it when something precious & beautiful finds its way into my life.  go visit my friend  urlLink styro  and look at the fantastic orange hat she just finished.  it's fabulous and she's radiant!  has anyone else noticed that  urlLink Clay Aiken's  single "Invisible" is a tad bit stalker-ish?  "if i was invisible, then i could just watch you in your room . . ."  love ya, Clay, but that crap is creepy.  surely your agent read the lyrics before s/he came to you with "this would be an awesome first single!"  hire  me , Clay.  i'm a pop culture junkie.  i'll protect you from the next serial killer single some fool tries to make you sing . . .  *oops*  i tried not to spin negative on this entry and am not sure i succeeded.  there's always tomorrow.

      grip.    it's important to have a good grip on so many things.  steering wheels, sanity, finances, golf clubs, etc.  HOWEVER . . . when i go into an establishment to use my money to procure goods or services and do my part to further the health of our economy, i'd prefer it if the folks taking my money would  refrain  from jeopardizing my own physical health and sanity.  how exactly do they offend, you ask?  THEY  LICK  THEIR FREAKIN' FINGERS TO GET A GOOD GRIP!  they lick to get a grip on my purchase, the bag i'm gonna leave with, the pen i may use to sign a credit slip, or the change i may be due.  i expect to leave with the things i came in for.  i do NOT expect to leave with a stranger's saliva and god-knows-what-else on my things!  i've actually walked out on two purchases because the register folks were licking for every damn thing they did.  would it be too forward to ask them not to lick their fingers while dealing with my purchase?  my husband thinks so.  no more rude than licking my belongings, i say.  are you a finger licker?  think about this: what do you touch during the course of a day?  think of the person who touched that doorknob before you - did they wash their hands after taking a dump in the public restroom?  after petting an animal that routinely licks its own anus?  after touching money that's been through countless other unwashed hands?  mock me for my neurosis if you will, and enjoy your encounter with whatever fecal viruses you may happen upon out there in finger lickin' land.

      inclement weather has the state in a tizzy.  the driving conditions are less than perfect, but that doesn't worry me.  it's the other drivers out there - i'm not sure they took the same drivers ed course that i did!  the formula for my frosty day freak out:  1 human 1 over-sized, gas-guzzling, SUV 4 tires that give aforementioned human the notion that they can climb over anything 1 cell phone kids, to taste  sprinkle with precipitation and garnish commute with traffic lights for a complete nightmare.  the human in this recipe was stomping on his brakes for stoplights and flooring it whenever he got the green, making him slide all over the place.  he seemed to find it amusing - i did not.  but it did give him more clearance on the highway.  f@#!er.  the only thing i despise more than a cell-phone-up-the-ass-SUV driver is a  look!- it's-my-living-room-on-wheels! mini-van creep.  mini-vans suck, and unless you're in charge of driving six kids to-and-fro every day FOR A LIVING, you've got no business owning one.  they aren't economical, they aren't attractive, and there are other, as-practical/more pleasing vehicles out there for those of you with more kids than your fair share and soccer gear to tote.    *whew*  so nice to get that said.  tomorrow's topic: finger lickers

      it’s a little early on a saturday morning for such a challenge, but here goes:  i’m going to attempt to share with you one of my crazy dreams – not the whole thing (because that would take all blogging morning) but rather brief sketches, so hopefully you’ll get the idea of how crazy they really are. . .  act one: i was living in some kind of weird swiss-family robinson highrise; this first phase of the dreaming had a  very day-in-the-life feel to it.   a man (boy, really.  he looked like what i imagine Jude Law would’ve looked like at 20) followed me around – on walks, public transport, ferry rides -  professing his love and offering a ring he’d bought for me. somehow he managed to not make me feel like i was being stalked.  this part of the dream also included a bit where i was waking up from a good night’s sleep to find an ex-lover scaling the wall outside my window to reach his own flat in that weird treehouse.  the second act: i received an assignment to write an article on italian family life & the culinary world of atlantic city.  (i can probably count on one hand the number of times i’ve been to AC, so there’s little/no basis for these images!)  i went to a large buffet on the boardwalk – a cross between a public transport station in Minority Report and pieces of the resort featured in Dirty Dancing – and met with the daughter of the family who owned it.  she served me a salad that cost me $18.65.  it was the best salad i’d ever had.  i’m a germophobe – there’s no way i’d be eating at a buffet.  i’m also happily married, and my husband looks  nothing  like Jude Law.

      ah, the joys of home ownership.  my husband called me at work with "we've got a bird in the fireplace."  (it wasn't clear if he wanted me to run home to help with this fowl situation or not . . .)  i came home to find the husband going crazy because: the dog was watching the cats who were torn between trying to escape the dog and wanting to watch the bird in the fireplace like so much television.  it was very exciting 1. because there was a wild thing in my home and 2. this situation was completely new and different from every other incident we've had since moving in.  the next five minutes were a little like ballet: enter the principal (that's me) moving gracefully about with sheet after wing-ed thingy.  see bird being chased by cats who are being chased by dog who is being herded by husband while trying to shoo aforementioned bird out the open door WHICH by now is starting to attract the domestic animals.  the act ended with the bird being escorted out.  that'll teach us to leave the freakin' flue open.

      our mothers are in a constant state of telling us what is best for us, aren't they?  it usually takes me a couple of years to get around to listening to my mother.  first, it was all about "cut out the white flour/sugar."  when i finally gave in to that, turns out that those overprocessed beasties are responsible for a whole lot of arthritic-style pain i've been suffering (dammit.  toast is one of my most favourite things!)  in celebration of MLK weekend, i thought i'd test drive the seneca indian cleansing diet, which my mother says will be a great "spring cleaning."  it's a four-day deal:  first day - fruits & their juices (no added sugars in those juices; no bananas.)  second day - herbal teas with a bit of honey if desired.  third day - vegetables & their juices.  fourth day - broth made from cooking down veggies (cabbage, cauliflower, carrots, onions, garlic, etc.)  yesterday was day one, and i must say that, a little fruit-loopiness aside, it was lovely to enjoy a day where my gut wasn't twisted.  the husband was going to try to accompany me through this, but 11:00 AM rolled around and he whispered in my ear "i'm hungry."  i kicked him off the wagon.  i've got tremendous drive/focus when i need it, but not enough for two.  what else . . . watched director's cut of legend yesterday.  i think somewhere in between that version & the theatrical version there is a better movie, but i love it still.  always appreciate the atmospheres that ridley scott creates.  went to see the last samurai - TOTALLY fed my asian man fetish!  am infatuated with the actor who played katsumura.  am reading HP-the sorcerer's stone.  made the mistake of dipping three pages into the da vinci code :(  OMG that man's writing is delicious.  must . . . finish . . . task. . . at . . . hand . . .  will fight urge to soapbox about the michael jackson issue du jour.  suffice to say: one set of criminal charges pending - maybe you didn't do it.  two sets on the record - WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING LETTING MORE LITTLE BOYS INTO YOUR BED?!!!!  'nuf said.

      don't you love the day before a holiday weekend? tgif, baby.  i'm ready for an overdose of good books, a matinee, and a pint or two (or three . . .)  or martinis.  martinis are yummy.  of course, there's always laundry and home improvement to be done.  i don't mind it so much.  am currently trying to find a new & inspirational colour for my kitchen.  the husband says it doesn't motivate him to cook (and it's in my best interests to motivate him to cook, straight up!)  right now it's a lovely taupe - neither offensive nor particularly pleasing.  i was thinking metal, or something lightly organic (like the seaweed wall at next-door nobu, dig?)  i'm not so hostile today.  the pig is still slacking, but i don't care 'cause i've got benefits AND am gearing up for a paid holiday.  life is good.

      holy crap.  i've got the look-i'm-posting-into-the-void jitters.  it's 4:12 AM, and i'm hungry AND so freaking awake.  rather than read a book or play the ps2 i thought i'd try this.  i'm thinking that just maybe this will be the solution to using my friends as late night journals.  like drunk dialing, i'm given to wee-hour musings that i sometimes wish i could take back or at least edit for content.  today's rant:  the guy in the office that sees fit to remove a shelf from the poor college-dorm-size fridge that i share with the 8 people in my office so he can fit a hulking pitcher of kool-aid in there.  a shining example of the sense of entitlement run rampant in contemporary society.  what happened to thoughtfulness & consideration?  when did "i'm gonna get me mine's" become the standard?  what gives this guy (a temp, no less) the notion that it's okay to displace the tuna-on-wheat belonging to a three-years-on employee with his bucket of cheap sugar water?  i miss polite society - and please don't take that the wrong way.  i'm not into closeted rage or denial, i just wish people would be sweet more often (more flies with honey and all that . . .)  is it too much to f!@#ing ask?  BE KIND.

      someone whose opinion i value most highly once told me that my writing lacked details - that i needed to round out and develop my ideas and images.  years later, i find myself blogging.  i LOVE being able to fire off whatever fleeting thing comes to mind, and yet again i hear from someone else that i trust that it seems i'm stealing time for these little blurbs.  he's right, you know.  i am snatching five minutes here and fifteen minutes there to write some small bitching thing that doesn't really mean much.  my excuse for not writing more: that more than a paragraph or two on the stuf that inspires me would wear out the reader.  who wants to listen to a cranky woman bitch about bad drivers and impolite shoppers for chapters on end?  of course, if you know me at all, you know that what really keeps me from producing is fear.    my family and friends have always maintained that i need to write a book of one sort or another.  i would love to oblige, but frequently find that most of my ideas for characters or story line aren't juicy enough to warrant page after page of details.  i also fear i'll never be able to produce in a way that meets with their approval or piques their interest.  mostly i'm afraid i'll disappoint myself.    lucky me - my blog is almost as much about me as it is about you.  i want to write about things we may have in common, and i'm getting ready to post a monster blog about something so freaking personal and deep - it's frightening.    are you ready?

      oh, for crying out loud.  i was on such a roll with the quality, joy-filled blogs and now that's all gone down the toilet.  there's this guy in my office who simply cannot say anything without using goofy jargon and a bad fake accent.  he also cannot make it through a sentence without grunting or clearing his throat.  it drives me insane! (okay, it's a short drive, but it's  my  drive, dammit!)  i call him "grunty", because calling him by his name makes my skin crawl.  when he first started working here, he responded to my coming in with my long hair down with a cat-call and "meow! if i were your husband i wouldn't have let you leave the house this morning."  HR-violation FREAK!  now i'll admit that i'm a chronic flirt, and i'll dance on that HR-v line with the best of them, but DON'T assume rapport where there is none, ass-munch!    thanks for listening - it always feels better to express these things.

      so i'm finished with the da vinci code - absolutely delicious read, right up until the last 15 pages or so.  a beautifully crafted story ended with a hint of "i've got to finish this book time to tie up loose ends let me connect the dots for you quickly and OH! maybe a schlocky smoochy kissy face scene would be nice, too."  while the notion of young cryptographer lovin' up on bookish professor-type is quite sexy, i would NEVER believe that they'd suddenly hook up right after solving such a huge, career-making, life-altering mystery!  i mean, i CAN believe that they'd probably make wild monkey love at some point (well-dressed, big brains, green eyes, etc, etc.) because i'm sure that such an achievement would make for a first-rate aphrodisiac, but COME ON!  something about pressing her body against his blahblahblahblah.  it's only one or two sentences, but it's SO harlequin romance. :P  now i've moved on to the prequel: angels & demons.  so far i'm enjoying it even more!  scarier villain, even scarier secret society, and a lot more on the langdon character (he's hot!)    HEY!  it's valentine's day!  let's celebrate another dead saint - my husband just made breakfast and it's time to go eat.  feeling chatty again, so i may be back later . . .

      this is a celebration blog!  a blog of JOYJOYJOY!  after a stinky wednesday, followed by a less-than-stellar thursday morning, i decided i was entitled to (yes, i believe that sometimes people are entitled!) an extremely indulgent lunch.  off to  urlLink MOVABLE FEAST ! it's a scooped out old cinderblock building that has been converted into a catering service AND the most fantabulous place for beautiful, healthy food!  the decor: golden sponge-painted walls, mismatched dining room tables and chairs, a deli counter filled with so much good stuf it makes you wish yer belly was so much bigger, and a shelf-surround that sports a cool collection of vintage toys.  they routinely have displays by local artists, too (everybody likes to support the local scene ;)  anyway - today was all about the bacon blue salad.  it was so delicious, with perfectly chopped greens, luscious grape tomatoes, fresh crumbled bacon, black olives, red onion, and REAL bleu cheese dressing . . . i was sad to reach the end of it!  if you're ever in the area, i STRONGLY suggest stopping by the feast - fabulous sandwiches, crabcakes that are totally WORTH whatever they're charging today, hearty soups for cold winter mornings, desserts MADE for breaking diets, and an atmosphere that is all about comfort.  *ahhhhhhhhhhh . . . *

      remember the slacker pig? WELL . . .  today, while on the phone with a buddy, he turned to a female co-worker and said "hey!  can you go get me a pepsi?"  now i've been on my way to the WAWA (convenience store) for a cup of soup and asked folks if they wanted anything, and it's not unusual for any one of us heading in the direction of the vending machines to extend a little courtesy to a co-worker in need.  THIS exchange doesn't EVEN fit into either of those scenarios.  who does he think she is?  his  mama ?  his wife?  his servant girl?  thanks to this pig, i've been in hyper-productive mode all day (you know the modus operandi. . . . when you can suddenly type 150 WPM and manage five different projects WHILE handling your personal life and lunch?)  this calls for cocktails AND a cigarette.

      if carbs were drugs, girl scout cookies would be crack - inexpensive and absolutely thrilling for the five minutes the box lasts.  my supervisor just laid a sleeve of do-si-dos on the break room counter and they were spirited away by glassy-eyed co-workers in seconds flat!  people talk about favourites, when we all know full well that, with few exceptions, we'll eat them all!  i'm dreaming of the day when a fund raising effort doesn't include white sugar or flour or useless crap that will simply end up in a landfill.  if your cause is worthy, just ask for the money.  i'd rather just give those girls the $5 and keep my already curvaceous self from turning into the blob.  back to work.  more later - i'm feeling chatty.

      do you remember the days when a turn signal meant  "i intend to turn or switch lanes sometime in the very near future.  please pay attention." ???  i remember my driver's ed instructor stressing how important it was to let other drivers know my intentions while on the road.  something about courtesy . . . responsibility . . . SAFETY.  the message that same signal sends now (if it is used at all) is "LOOK WHAT I AM DOING!" (applied mid-action) or "LOOK WHAT I DID!" (that ridiculous not- even -half-assed attempt at a signal made after the deed is done - looks more like a firefly than a signal!)  NEWS FLASH:  edging into my lane does NOT constitute a signal - it just makes you a crappy, inconsiderate, jackass driver.    thing is, if you'd just ask nicely (by using your signal), i'd let you in with a wave and a smile.  when it comes to sharing the road with this girl, you get what you give, you reap what you sow, and if you f!@# with me, i'll become the most obnoxious driver you've ever seen and the only way you'll get over is by FLYING over me.   f'real!

      it  would  be good weather for a tropical plant, if it were but 50 degrees warmer outside.  i am ready for spring!  i mean it.  puxatawney phil saw his shadow, which means six more weeks of winter.  i'm pretty sure it also means we're due for one more friggin' snow storm.    last year was labour intensive in the snow department, but it was beautiful.  this year: not so much shoveling, but uglyuglyugly and black ice everywhere.  this winter's offerings were currier & ives for approximately 1/2 hour after each snowfall, then iced over.  it has stayed so cold for so long that chunks of ice now look like charcoal briquettes from steeping in exhaust!  finished the first harry potter and have moved on to  urlLink the da vinci code  - VERY excited to be there, too!  husband just finished Brown's angels & demons and said that was worth the read as well.  don't you love getting excited about a book?  i mean, walking into a bookstore can be such a thrill! and i've wept through the first 10-15 minutes of each installation of the Tolkein trilogy, overjoyed that someone attempted to capture those precious words on film!  now i'm gushing & blushing . . . if you have a book that makes you that happy, please let me know about it.  writers that thrill me: Tolkein, Walker, Thoreau, cummings, Rice/Rampling, Hurston, Gaiman, Faulkner, to name a few.  i also get a huge kick out of Gorey's little books . . .   it's good weather for staying indoors & reading!

      that's some  O ther  P eople's  P ostings, baby.  oh, dear.  hit the sidebar again, and ended up visiting the bazillionth wanna-be-writer of erotica.  please don't think i'm frigid - i'm not.  i'm a girl of appetites, like a normal human being.  i just get so TIRED of the cheap shot, the money shot, the shake-yer-money-maker shot.  this woman's stuf was better than most, but a little too much gratuitous f-bombing for my taste (again, don't get me wrong.  i curse like a sailor, but believe that it's an art.  too much of anything leads to overkill.)  she had cool pin-ups on her blog, and admittedly the first of the posts that i read was sexy.  it just got old.  eating ice cream is the only thing that i'm pretty sure  never  gets old.  what never gets old for you?  something cool she had on her site is amusing for 30 seconds or so, so try it yerself:  urlLink bat the penguin!   on a happy note, the nasty grunty man i mentioned in an older posting has LEFT THE BUILDING!  his last day was friday, and i'm so freakin' ecstatic!  i didn't want to say anything before this, because i was afraid i'd jinx it.  hallelujah!  his parting shot was to HUG me (BLECH! i rarely let people i LOVE do that, sucka! i threw my right arm across my chest to protect the twins) and leave a duplicate jetdirect box that was never needed in the first place behind for me to return to corporate.  damn that geek.  enough already.  it's burger night.  6:45 if you're interested . . .

      how's THAT for a fun title?  yeah, this weekend was all about those two things.  the husband and FIL took down the row of decrepit hemlocks that lined the back of our yard.  they (8 of those suckers) are now in a heap, waiting for the chipper to come and take them away.  wanna hear something funny?  we bought our home from a retired professor & his wife.  they had lived there for nearly forty years!  i loved the house from the start and loved the fact that it had real history - four children raised, horticultural gifts from friends in far off places, and a genuine sense of neighbor-hood.  it took a little faith on my husband's part to get past the pink living room and trust that i could make this house our own. and yes, i mean pink.   your grandma's pink.   the walls, the trim, even the mantle of the fireplace was  PINK .  what's funny?  we've been friendly-ish with the former owners since moving in, trying to be sensitive to the fact that they've lived half their lives in our home.  they've popped by on occasion on their way to/from church to say a polite hello, and we thought nothing of it.  then their grown children stopped in.  then i got an email commenting on something we'd done to the yard.  now we joke that anytime we're doing something to the outside of the house, it draws them.  sure enough, we chop down those friggin' hemlocks on friday and who should pull up in front of the house on sunday?  the funny thing is that they - i should say the wife - continues to comment on how whatever we're doing doesn't fit their needs:   "WE never needed a gate [to the back of the property]"    (YOU didn't have a 113 lb puppy to contain!)    "i always got out and cut back the junipers this time of year."    (you didn't mind looking at your neighbors or having them look at you)    "[now that you've finally cut off the bottom branches of the pine tree] there's more room for azaleas!"    (one more azalea and our yard WILL look like the 13th at augusta!)   now don't get me wrong, i really do like these people, and i love the fact that our house didn't need a minute of warming to make it homey (it did, however, need a major paint job!)  i just think we may need a smudging ceremony to consecrate the space as ours!  enough of that - the weekend was a little funky where the husband was concerned.  he went from suffering SAD to *ka-POW!* a mad case of spring fever.  he twitched all weekend long. we're driving each other a little crazy.  makes us grateful that our home has enough space to accommodate the two of us and the little crazy ;)

        "regret for the things we did can be tempered by time;  it is regret for the things we did not do that is inconsolable."  - sydney j. harris    only occasionally do i investigate the blogger sidebar - one random selection included the above quote and i LOVED it so much i had to put it here for sharing.  i love clever quotes, and this one captures my attitude toward life so well.  important "grown-ups" in my life occasionally make reference to regrets - the regrets they have, do i have any, maybe i'll have some later. . . blahblahblahblah  the only regrets i ever have are when i've inadvertently hurt someone.  i don't regret even the decisions/actions that have ended in tragedy or pain for myself, because they make me who i am (and i mostly enjoy who i am, dammit.)  i do, however, regret the times when my actions and self-indulgent behaviour have hurt others.  i never, ever mean to make others unhappy.   *whoa*   waxing heavy.  time to talk about  happy .  two friends joined the spouse & me for 1/2 price burger night at the  urlLink deer park tavern .  it was great, except we had to sit in the  freakin'  pappy's room again.  pappy's is (i believe) a now defunct pizza joint particular to delaware.  the deer park is a newly renovated old old old tavern.  part of the phat renovation included sponge painting the walls, opening up the second floor & adding a terrace, and turning what used to be the room for dancing into a room that looks like a freakin' family pizza place.  such a turn-off, family style seating in a college town tavern.  if you live in or are traveling through the area, the half-price burger night (tuesday) and the bloody mary bar (sunday brunch) are worth the trip.  hope y'all are enjoying spring!  send me good quotes, please.  i love 'em!

      happy st. patrick's day, everyone!  i met an irish man in an irish bar a few years back and ended up marrying him.  with the man came a very irish family from galway and donegal - isn't that charming?  tonight it's corned beef and cabbage with redskin potatoes at the in-laws, with my MIL singing "won't ya have a glass o'wine wi me, girl?"  i'm more of a guiness girl, and she doesn't stock that.  when you marry irish, the irish friends and family are a little obsessive about whether or not you are irish (i'm not.  i'm mexican/english)  they pound you with this question every chance they get.  one night, after too many pints, a well-meaning irish woman came up and said "oh, c'mon.  you've got a little irish in ya, don't cha?"  i replied, "on occasion."  it took her a few minutes to get that one.  on a wild tangent: a friend gave me a little cat-of-the-day calendar for 2004.  today's puss is sporting a goofy knit green cap and scarf with a button that says "kiss me i'm irish."  the cat looks perfectly happy with his outfit.  weird.  enough of that - go celebrate and let me know what kind of mischief you get into . . .

      so my dad has this conversation with some guy who prefaced his commentary regarding mel gibson's passion of the christ with "i'm not going to get religious or political . . ." and then launched into how impressive it was to see what Christ suffered for our sins.  my dad is catholic, as am i.  we believe in Jesus Christ, but are a tad bit fringe-y in just  how  we think of Him.  commenting on Christ's suffering and the notion of "sin" . . . my father's acquaintance failed to remain neutral in either the religious or political arena!  did that guy really think that gibson's portrayal of Christ's suffering was accurate?  did he take it so literally?  we can dig into the history of crucifixion, we can research tools of torture, but man can only speculate about what Christ suffered or exactly why He suffered.  i always have in mind that the Bible is a translation of a translation of select writings from that time period - and i seldom allow any one human being to tell me what any part of that writing means.  i give more weight to the opinions of people who spend more time than i do contemplating scriptures and the history that surrounds them, but refuse to listen to people of any faith that presume to tell me what "God" thinks, feels or desires for my life.  i believe that a person's relationship with the universe - whether or not that universe includes the concept of God/god/goddess or faith - is their own business.  to assume that any one of us knows "God" or what he/she thinks/feels is presumptuous and further evidence of mankind's self-important, top-of-the-food-chain view of the universe.  i think the majority of "Christians" enjoy the idea that they are important enough that someone had to die for them (even though there are contemporary heroes we hardly even notice who give their lives for us every day), and the more horrific and spectacular the death, the better.  what's that news media line?  "if it bleeds, it leads . . ."  whoa.  i'm babbling.  all my dad wanted to know was if the guy enjoyed the movie or thought that it was "good."  i'd like to congratulate mel for starting the dialogue he had hoped for, and admonish the public to keep in mind that Christ was a man - not a rubber animatronic thing with hoses for pumping blood.  a friend who is in the forensic sciences commented that a human being could not lose the quantity of blood mel's Christ lost on the way to the cross and live to suffer the crucifixion.  Jesus probably wasn't the hunky ragin' caucasian that  urlLink jim caviezel  is, either.  did you see this movie?  was it quality movie making, or mere shock cinema?  i may wait for the dvd . . .

      holy crap.  like i'm not tense enough, what with contract arbitration and job searches and personal issues!  i pull the jeep into the driveway after my long day (at work or on the way to work from 8:00 AM until 7:00 PM), hop gracefully out of the jeep (yeah, right!), and head for the front door of my house, fumbling with my keys.  as i make it up the steps, i smell burning, and hear a soft crinkly noise . . .  afraid that my house or someone else's is on fire, i wheel around to find that NO!  the jeep - MY JEEP! - is rolling oh-so-softly DOWN THE DRIVEWAY AND INTO THE STREET!  too shocked, i run - in three inch heels with hands still full - down the driveway after it.  SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! a-l-l the way down the driveway after that frickin' cherry red jeep.  i stick two fingers into the door handle and pull.  the door swings open and i begin to throw my body weight against the jeep's momentum.  it pulls me with it down the drive.  i outpace it by a couple of steps, throw my parcels into the seat and JUMP!  i felt like daisy duke - only more sexy and a lot heavier ;)    i hit the brake and stopped the jeep from rolling into my neighbor's front yard.  *whew!*  another driver comes around the corner just as we stop, and he begins to get impatient.  he has no idea how close he came to being smashed to bits by my runaway jeep.  i turn the key and pull the jeep up into the driveway once more.    this time i left that sucker in gear.

      don't you think we've evolved enough to make the work week a four day affair?  i mean, so much efficiency, so much technology, and a large percentage of us are still trucking along in the 8-hour-a-day-5-days-a-week rut!  how much happier would i be to work a 9 or 10 hour day and have a three-day week end?  OMIGOD - i'd be smiling almost all the time.  businesses could choose monday or friday as their new weekend day; maybe certain industries set a standard of taking one day or the other.  what would that do for our sanity?  for the economy?  a whole "traditional" week day to get grown-up errands done?  how much more would we travel?  eat out?  shop?  spend dough on home improvement?  certain financial institutions in my area currently offer the four-day work week as an option to their employees.  sometimes the hours they work are insane, but the people i know who have this seem pretty happy with it.  do you have a four day work week?  did it change your life?  for the better?  worse?  any ideas about other potential impacts of such a scheme?  i'm curious . . .

      remember the friend i mentioned, who had visited my blog and expected more?  i found out WHY . . .  he wrote a ten-paragraph first entry for his virgin blog!  i'm humbled and impressed, although i never  did  say that one should expect a lengthy tome from this page.  this is really meant to be like a diary for me, and hopefully occasionally entertaining or provocative for the passer-by.  i'm so grateful that he was willing to share so much detail -  i am always awed when humans make themselves so accessible and vulnerable.   so the taurean divas (myself, and my three best taurus girlie friends) are in the process of planning an arizona tour for june.  i cannot wait!  a stay in sedona for a little r&r and spa time (although if the pool is fine i may save the $$ & just bake for a while!) followed by a visit to diva R's home in flagstaff.  these women always make me laugh so hard - makes it worth the wait in between gatherings!  the last one was at diva A's home in florida, which was delicious, except that i still wasn't quite back to being me after my husband's cancer diagnosis.  the ladies weathered it, though, and for that i am so very grateful.   friends love you in spite of yourself . . .   it's the end of another week.  the husband has a rugby match tomorrow, which gives me time to myself.  this translates into time for the  keep-the-cats-away-from-my-$$$-furniture  project.  wish me luck.  i'm thinking of changing oona's name to houdini, 'cause she's managed to escape all previous attempts at roping her in!  have a wonderful weekend, everyone!

      it's the last day of my sixth annual honeymoon tour, the day before i get back to the SOS.  i'm not filled with the usual dread, but instead am rested and ready to get back to it. (of course, the day is still young.  we'll see how i'm feeling when 6PM rolls around ;)  we had a LOVELY time at the beach - fabulous dinners (THANKS, DAD!) and a lovely suite (THANKS, ILs!) and lots of time just being ourselves, celebrating the things we love most about each other.  after five years of marriage, my guy still makes me laugh harder than most, still pays attention to what's important in life, and most importantly - he reciprocates that deep down love i have for him.    now we're back at home, doing all the things we usually do: recycling, cleaning, coming up with the next scheme for keeping the cats away from my leather sofa, coaching rugby, planning meals, attacking the yard . . . i love it!    today's victory - i wound a bobbin & threaded my new sewing machine all by myself (now i can start changing thread colours, which is good, because i've run out of white things to stitch!)  vacation is good, but there is no place like HOME!

      so my MIL's best friend is dying.  slowly.  dying . . . very . . . slowly.  she's having little heart attacks one right after the other (and they keep reviving her!  PLEASE, if you know me, and are anywhere near when it's my time, and my body does something like that - DON'T let anyone keep torturing me with food and electricity.  i've made my peace.)   there's a wedding this weekend, and the IL's are going (my husband & i are excusing ourselves to enjoy our 5th anniversary.)   she (MIL) calls to ask my opinion on what she should wear.  rather than try to do this over the phone, i say "let's have lunch", thinking that would be a nice gesture and maybe cheer her up a little.   here's how it went:   MIL:  i made quiche!   gg:  i love quiche!    MIL:  your dad has the nicest surprise planned for you guys this weekend! [our anniversary!]   gg:  i guess it's not a surprise anymore!    MIL: you should make nice with your sister!   gg:   stay out of it, my sister is evil and you know nothing about it!    MIL: have some more quiche!   gg:  i think i will!    MIL:  did i mention that your dad has the nicest surprise planned for you guys this weekend?!   gg:   yes, you did, and i threw my hands over my ears and screamed SHUT UP!    MIL: my best friend is dying. she was like a mother to my sons.   gg:  i know.  she's had a good life and is very lucky to have friends like you.    MIL:  your dad is such a lovely man.  enjoy the rest of the day, honey!    THIS WAS THE WORST LUNCH HOUR . . . EVER.    i hope you're having a better day ;)   **the end**

      FINALLY!  after weeks of me treating this "un-scripted drama" show like a business text-book, Bill from chicago gets the jobbie job.  good for him!  staged and edited as it was, i enjoyed every friggin' week of it.  well, i enjoyed everything  except  for that omarosa chick.  what a chip on!   omarosa is bad press for every single demographic point she represents!   i can't stand her, and am completely freaked out if she is, in fact, getting even 1/4 of the offers she claims she's getting.  she is not the girl i love to hate - she's the girl i would rather not watch.  WHY is the american public willing to pay money to watch a liar/cheater in action?  if she becomes the next richard hatch (a character who will make me change the channel faster than you can say "snake"), the apprentice will become one more show nixed from my list.  kwame should have fired her ass the second he caught her in that big fat lie - she seriously handicapped him.  *whew*  enough data-entry spent on her.  i enjoyed the rest of the cast, enjoyed seeing The Donald do his thing on primetime, and applaud Bill's choice of projects:  waaaayyyy cooler to shape the chicago skyline than to fiddle with a golf course that has fallen once into the ocean!  beautifully warm spring weather we're having here in the northeast - the quince & forsythia are blooming, and the fireworks of azaleas & rhododendron in my yard have begun (my favourite, a sincerely hot pink stunner, is preparing to bloom.  i should learn to put pictures up here so y'all can see!)  hope you're enjoying it!

      i cannot BELIEVE it's FIVE YEARS this year!  i've been married to my best guy for five years.  how far we have come in that five years!  a new home, a new dog, a move to another city (okay, so we never left delaware. whatever!), and we survived two cancers!  i haven't told you about that before, have i?  my husband played rugby for years.  when we first started dating, he was in a constant state of "don't touch!  rugby!" whenever i got too close to a battle wound.  then one weekend he came home with a bruise to the hip that lasted a little too long.  i staged a sit-in until he went to the doctor.  an x-ray showed no damage from the boot-to-the-hip action, but WOW! what a bone tumour he had!  nearly 8cm!  into the hospital and out with that growth.  we thought we were clear, but when they biopsied the tumour they found AML m3 LEUKEMIA!  doesn't that SUCK?  back into the hospital for complications & chemotherapy.  it was definitely trial by fire for the "sickness . . . health . . . til death us do part" clause in our wedding vows!  anyway, this anniversary finds us just months away from finishing his meds - and celebrating every single day.  i hate to sound schmaltzy, but this much i know is true: CHERISH YOUR RELATIONSHIPS!  cherish all of them. tell folks how much you love them every chance you get, even if it causes uncomfiness.  my honey slipped away twice while in hospital, and i had such peace knowing that he would leave me with no doubt of my love for him.      and if you're reading this, bay, i mean it:    i love you so much it hurts.  if everyone else knew love equal to half of what we share, the world would be a much better place.  thank you for keeping me in your life, and thank you for staying in mine.  no more dying - we've got too much left to share!

      someone asked me if i kept a diary.  hell, yeah, i do.  i keep it online, for all the world to see.    so i've changed the blog's title to try and talk myself into a better mood.  nobody but me understands the pig reference anyway (not that i particularly  need  anyone else to understand it, but it was a little off-putting, wasn't it?)   styro's on vacation, by the way, so if yer trying to hit her link, there will be no joy at url end.  we had a WONDERFUL visit last weekend - it was as though not a day had passed!  she's still the beautiful, smart, cheeky sweet gal i remember.  we talked until the wee hours and sipped the johnny walker black (she with ice, i without ;) which always makes for a good time.  if only the visit could've lasted longer!  time to plan this gg's adventures in styro-land!  i need some sunshine - so if you've got some, spread a little (and i do NOT mean that chicken soup for the soul s@#*!)

       this is a very self-centered, bitchy little entry, so let the reader beware.     my husband and i have a code phrase for things that we want that everyone else has - "red honda".  it's based on the notion that when there's something you value, whether you have it or not, it seems everyone else has it.  like when you buy a new car, think it's the hottest shit ever, and suddenly everyone's driving one just like it.  the most persistent red honda for us has been babies.  we want them.  we want to be parents.  i've wanted children since i was twelve, and i'm fairly certain that my husband wants them worse than i do.  it SUCKS, because everyone else we know (it would seem) is either having them, has had them, or will be having them within the next nine months.  chemotherapy comes between us and trying right now, but we had tried for years prior to his diagnosis to no avail.  we have a "stash" at the bank, but i'm leary of that stuf, not keen on being poked and prodded into something unnatural.  so now i've found out that two of my best friends are expecting.  i can't even bring myself to tell my husband about the second one because i know how much it hurts.  part of me is excited, but a regrettably larger part of me is just flat-out jealous - even a little hateful.  i find myself sinking into a dark pit of envy and bitterness.  i'm not even in the mood for the words of encouragement & reassurance offered by friends & family anymore.  i just want people to know how much it SUCKS to want and not have.    according to what i hear out of my husband's office, the answer to infertility is apparently becoming a grossly overweight crack whore.  they don't seem to have  ANY  trouble conceiving.    but the real bitch of it is this: even if we could conceive right this minute, i'm always worried about jobs & home & cash & cars & schools & clothes & . . .

      it's been a crazy week, so i've been negligent on the journaling tip.  today i must share, however, because MY FRIEND STYRO IS COMIN'!!!!  i haven't seen her in years, and i just know we're going to have a blast.  hometown folk better look out!  i'm so excited that i can't decide what would be the most fun - taking her to a girlie toy party with a bunch of pistol-packin' mamas from probation & parole, or bar-hopping on our home turf.  i was also thinking that brown-bagging it around town for a nostalgic walk would be fun . . . hell, she's so great, i'm pretty sure she could say "hey!  let's hang out in front of the shell station all night!"  and i'd be happy as a clam!  maybe she'll teach me how to do pictures on my page this weekend . . .  i hope this finds you all well & enjoying the spring!

      a girlfriend of mine just bought her first home, and i had something of my own worth celebrating, so i dropped her a line and invited her over for beers & celebration on thursday night (husband went to watch the phillies stink up the joint - so it was GIRL TIME!) here's how the evening played out:    one beer   - your success, my success, good for us!    two beers   - your success and what it means to be really enjoying it, my success and what it means to be really enjoying it, good for us and anyone else who is experiencing a similar joy!  HOORAY! i'm so relaxed! it's good to share a beer with a good friend!    three beers   - i'm glad we can share our success!  here's to our success!  *hiccup*  man, i sure do love my husband me too did you ever think you'd marry someone like him heck no if you'd pointed to him ten years ago and said "he's yours" i would've said "are you crazy?"    one shot of blue hen vodka   - i only pull this vodka out for special occasions i'm special you're special what a special time in our lives this is yeah man i am loving my thirties hell yeah remember our twenties? don't remind me! remember member ember . . .    fourth & final beer   - (crying) our friendship is so important to me i love you man me too jeez this beer is really working yeah i feel GREAT! (right now that is - probably not so good tomorrow . . .)  a little drink of water, a little more conversation, and then i fell OUT! way out, that is, until 2 in the morning, when my body woke up and said  "DUDE! you need to hook me up with some excedrin, a couple more bottles of water, and you better start thinking about phazyme - 'cause you KNOW about my wheat allergies!"   rough (yet glorious) night. i made it to work in one piece, certain that yes, i no longer have the recuperative powers of a twenty-something.

      i'm always amazed at the words people will adopt and manipulate for everyday use.  i am further entertained by attempts to phonetically capture accents & jargon that aren't found in webster's. one of mary j. blige's latest singles really got me: "let's get crunk, try to have a good time . . ." blah blah blah  i'd listen to it again & again, trying to figure out what "hateration" and "holleration" really meant.  i mimicked the dance moves on the video, thinking it would put my half-caucasian behind more in sync with whatever the hell mary was trying to tell me . . .  the bit about "let's get crunk . . ." was officially under my skin, so i googled it.  here's what i found:   crunk   \Crunk\ (kr[u^][ng]k), Crunkle \Crun"kle\ (kr[u^][ng]"k'l), v. i. [Cf. Icel. kr?nka to croak.]  To cry like a crane.  [Obs.] ``The crane crunketh.'' --Withals (1608).  Source: Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, © 1996, 1998 MICRA, Inc.   so mary's idea of a good time is to wail like a big gawky bird?  at least she doesn't dance like a big gawky bird - do your thang, mary!

      another burger night at the deer park - oh, how i love them!  another sour cream, chili, jalapeno burger (no bun, no fries, please) with husband & an assortment of friends.  why "bring back the pickle?"  the dp has been serving a wedge of cantaloupe - even with our burgers!  so we've started requesting that they BRING BACK THE PICKLE!  whoever heard of  cantaloupe  with a bacon cheeseburger & fries?    we go just about every week (we've skipped one so far that i can remember) and invite any & all to join us.  always makes for an interesting mix and we get to hear some good stories.  last night's group included two ruggers, their roommate, and one of the guys from my husband's office.  i sat somewhere in the middle - to my left were tales of binge drinking, finals, and somebody giving a guy head in the middle of the street during mardi gras (okay, it was a re-visiting of the story - but MAN is it a good one!)  On my right the husband & the guy from his office were talking about office politics (they can always predict whether a female or ethnic minority is going to be selected for promotion!) and a felon/"local author" who skated with just three months in jail.   burger night - it's never boring.

      you know you're in your thirties when:  - household appliances thrill you - you look forward to the "no interest/no payments" deals at the home depot and good's furniture stores - you plan your weekend around a trip to take advantage of aforementioned deals - the arrival of new shutters warrants a special call to your spouse - the arrival of a new lock-set for a door that isn't even here yet warrants the same kind of attention that the shutters received  i'm fairly certain we'll spontaneously combust when the door is actually installed . . .

      i was just having a lovely conversation with my friend, H, and my frickledy fracking mobile ;) ran out of juice!  AND, to make things worse, i've left my charger at work!  TICKED! FRUSTRATED! CUT OFF!   *whew*  so if you're reading this, H, know that i enjoyed the conversation and wish it could've continued.  i'll ring you when i get my charger back tomorrow ;)  good luck with the styling jobbie job!   what a week!  major meltdown at work over something that turned out to be nothing, huge episodes of insomnia vexing me, house in chaos, pets in a tizzy, yard out of control (actually, the yard isn't that bad, i'm just venting) and head in a whirl. just got back from dinner out (cafe gelato) and symphony (24-year-old wunderkind on the piano followed by an excrutiating mahler bit - i say "bit" and mean beautiful but white-knuckle-ass-long piece of art.)  should be sleeping in preparation for tomorrow . . .  tomorrow includes husband running off for alumni rugby games (go UD! go husband!) for most of the day while i check off the list of things to do 'round the house: shear ivy, edge sidewalk, finish laundry, prepare guestroom, work on family scrapbook for beloved grandmother, etc, etc.  i am SO looking forward to a few daze vacation in june!

      first, let me be clear:  i do NOT like things that are fake (unless they are done tongue-in-cheek.  that's sometimes funny)  what i DO like:  people who understand the value of a pleasant greeting and a smile.  as far as i'm concerned, the first exchange of the day between me & an office-mate should go something like this . . .   GG:   good morning!    o-m:   good morning!  what happens after that?  whatever!  you can even scream at me first thing in the morning provided that you've given me a bare minimum of a greeting.  i cannot stand people who skip pleasantries just because they're ticked or grumpy. i think being able to greet someone before saying "this needs to be fixed" radiates professionalism. skipping the greeting tells me you're petty & ridiculous & you're about to make something personal.  i also can't stand people who hover behind me while i'm sitting at my desk instead of saying "excuse me."      i really miss hearing these words in everyday conversations:   please excuse me thank you you're welcome good morning  if you want my attention - all you have to do is ask (politely.)

      that poor west chester man's tragic death is splattered all over our american media - jerks around my office are feeding on it and talking about it incessantly.   i think we need to be aware of such atrocities while maintaining respect for the dead and the family of the deceased.  i do not believe that freedom of the press gives us the right to gorge ourselves on pain and suffering.    just because we can do something, doesn't mean we should.      my heart is breaking.    it breaks over & over again - once for that man, once for his family, once for the other people on both sides of the conflict who suffer, and once again for our country.  bush now has another "justification" for making war, and just in time for the election.  i wonder if those iraqis are fully aware of what they have wrought with this nasty display, this horrible killing.

      so excited about the new template - TOTALLY BUMMED that the funny sweet comments from my readers have been deleted!  and what am i gonna do about the cool TASTY! links i had?  if y'all have suggestions on how to re-up those links w/o disturbing the sidebar, i'd be mighty grateful.  have started reading TJ's blog on a regular basis now - the man can write!    p.s. styro suggested plunging confidently into the abyss with the cut-n-paste, so i did and VOILA!  links!  TASTY!  will restore some of the fun stuf later today.

      another mother's day . . . *sigh*  made the trip downstate to see my mom.  1 hour spent speeding down the highway while listening to jimmy eat world, psyching myself up for another visit.  how i LOVE my mother!  gifts included: - one container lily-of-the-valley harvested from my own yard - one "prayer box" pendant   i collected a bunch of cool quotes, put them on little pieces of paper, rolled them up for use in the pendant.  the one i put inside for the pendant's virgin cruise:    "the most important thing i have to say to you, whatever else passes between us, is that i love you."    i told you i love her, and i meant that.  with that love comes a world of hurt (isn't that the way? only the ones we care about most have the power to really wound us)  we're slowly working through all of that crap and learning to enjoy each other (there's SO much to enjoy!)  she loved her gifts, which made me so very happy.  then we started talking . . . and somehow the subject of my pets came up and then my mother said something about people being more valuable or mourn-able than animals and then i said something about each being an animal with which i have a reciprocal caring relationship and then she got hurt and i f!@#ed up and said something about my pets being my children and then . . .  i told her i loved her more than my cats.  turns out that's all she wanted to hear.  happy mother's day, all you mothers out there.  you're some of my most favouritest animals!

       yeah, i changed my mind about the name -  again .   the nickname is tied to my work, and i thought it sounded better (actually, not necessarily  better  than Glamour Girl, just more like a cartoon character, which is what i was going for.)  the sun is shining, and i'm trapped in my cube . . .

      FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!  i love my cats - i have two.  i've had them since they were kittens, and now they're on the verge of 14 & 15 years old.  i consider them my oldest running voluntary relationships (relationships not forced by birth or marriage) and am grateful for the times they have stuck by me when i felt no one else would.  i am committed to sticking by them 'til death do us part.  HOWEVER: phase 4 of the get-the-fuck-off-my-furniture project was completed this morning around 9:15 AM.  i cut super thick foam core into a strip, covered it in 1/4 inch batting and then stitched it into a sleeve of striped sheer.  i felt a sense of real victory/accomplishment as i fastened it with velcro to the remaining open bits of the baby gate i'm determined to use for defining cat space.  i poked & pushed at the thing, figuring my efforts mimicked the force exerted by a 6 lb geriatric cat.  confident that i had finally succeeded, i went out into the day for a little yard work . . .  okay, not really a  little  yard work - i went out and planted 7 compacta hollies, adding them to a solo shrub i had taken for a test drive a few days back.  sinking the last holly into the ground, i felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment!  not only had i conquered that freaking cat issue; i had also completed a major landscaping project all by myself!  i went into the house to hydrate and take a cool shower . . .  after the shower i wrapped my wet hair in a towel and put on one of my long comfy cotton dresses that my husband abhors and sunk into bed for a little nap.  husband returns from the rugby match and wakes me - i'm pleased as punch and cannot wait to share my success stories!  he admires & gushes appropriately, and then runs out to pick up chinese food & a movie.  we watch 21 grams (WOW!) and then a little south park (isn't that always a good thing?) and then we head for bed.  as i round the corner, i get that funny feeling that i only get when the little PITA cat is up to no good and SURE ENOUGH!  she's pawed through my velcro, squeezed her way through the bars, and is now napping on the work skirt i had no intention of dry cleaning this week!  little fucker!  now my once carefully stitched project is rigged with safety pins.  ugly, but it should do the trick.  tomorrow is another day - when i begin to plot phase 5.  i'm determined that the final solution will be beautiful & functional.

      so i surf that sidebar while the bloggermachine is warming up, and i find  urlLink this joint  - this guy is giving the  urlLink biker-selling-a-wedding-dress-on-ebay  a run for the money in the F!@#$ING HYSTERICAL department.  i LOVED it.  i mean really loved it!  i've seen blogs where folks are writing novels (sometimes interesting), blogs where folks are documenting cool interests (like scooter clubs - GO STYRO! come back to us, PLEASE!), and blogs where people are getting schmaltzy (i've had my fill of the CSFTS crap.)  what makes this blog special: a glimpse into something that is DEFINITELY not everyday fare for a girl like me, thick with real humour & heart (see his posting about the skateboard boys - if you've ever been a kid on the fringe, it will make you smile!)  i'm going to make the link TASTY! so those of you who've missed this post can have a look ;)  you know i'm looking out for you!  the husband's out for rugby and i've completed phase four of the keep-the-cats-away project (seems to be working, but then, i haven't left the area yet, which makes oona pretty content to stay where she's supposed to be.) listened to blink 182's latest while stitching - makes me smile alot and shake my booty as i'm running around trying to find new ways to fasten batting & sheer to that fucking gate.  on another note:  i miss styrofoamkitty

      you'd think we'd be too pooped to party - J & i had weathered me having a panic attack in the philly airport, A had endured the infamous taxi-down-the-runway-OOPS!-sorry-you'll-have-to-deplane-and-make-other-arrangements pain in the ass, and poor R had to drive hours to pick up our exhausted behinds from the airport.    joy at the sight of each other, followed by a longish ride in the pathfinder.  did i mention that the pathfinder had a shimmy?  at high speeds, it felt a little like the runaway train ride at hershey park!  we were so grateful for the loan of the vehicle, though!  finally in sedona, we drop our bags with a sigh of relief. the hilton is lovely, and our suite is . . . sweet! (go ahead & groan ;)  J was tired, so she grabbed a little shut eye while the rest of us hit the shadowrock pool. lovely little 3' to 5' pool and a jacuzzi to boot! R, A & i regressed hardcore, loving the cool water, jumping & screaming like a bunch of 13-year-old girls on holiday.  we splashed & yelled & mimicked the new aflac commercial with the water-ballet & duck.  it was definitely  one  of my favourite moments on our trip.  back to the room for a towel-off & an attempt at sleep.  i can't speak for the others, but i had a bit of a rough go of it - crashing on a fold-out, losing my blanket & freezing my hiney off in the middle of the night. luckily, R & A had a little room to spare in the king-size bed.  i squeezed in and caught a few winks before saturday dawned . . .

      hell yeah! what an amazing trip! i don't even know where to start! diva J & i hopped a plane from philly to phoenix, where we were met by diva R.  she was looking GOOD!  AZ really suits her, and after just three days i could certainly see how the environment encourages one to be healthy. all i wanted was healthy food & exercise & h2o!  after diva A arrived we hopped in the pathfinder (THANKS, JOHN!) & headed for sedona & the hilton spa & resort. . .  WHAT A JOY! excepting a few snafus (faulty smoke alarms that woke us up more than once) it was a relaxing, lovely time.  mani/pedis, circle of life massage, & quality workout time (they more than i ;) made for a truly restorative stay. i fell in love with the landscape & the shadowrock pool.  after working on our tans, we were on our way to flagstaff - or FLAG as we were instructed - for a rustic cabin stay.  beautiful, but it confirmed that i am not the truly rustic cabin type (what can i say?  i am my mother's daughter!) we trucked around flag, discovering the beaver street brewery, meeting diva R's man & roommates & pets, & got to see where she works.  monday was all about the grand canyon, details to follow.  it was something else. so inspirational, i'm gonna take my first stab at posting photos later!  now it's back to work. i've got a massive deadline to meet.

      aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh . . .   thanks for all the well-wishing, folks!   i even got a greeting card from a friend of a friend to congratulate me on the new jobbie job!  how sweet!   it's another beautiful day in the neighborhood ( urlLink  STYRO  :  you are SO WELCOME to come live & work with me ANYTIME! we would rock the town properly ONCE AGAIN! MWAH HAH AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! come & get it girlie!)   had a dream that i took a bad phone message and my boss, who had previously said i was their first choice, came running down the hall, office manager in tow, saying "you were our FIFTH choice! FIFTH!"   is it too early to be waxing neurotic?   apparently not! :)  she reassured me that i was first.  f'real.  on a more somber note: i am definitely missing a couple of folks from the old office.  i hope they're doing well (you know who you are ;) xoxo

      holy CRAP! i'm having a good time - lunch with the boss, a grand tour of just 1 floor of the building i'm in (it's HUGE - i never knew!), and a load of fun new stuf to learn!  the walk to work this morning was not easy, but i found a more pleasant route than the one taken previously, so it was at least beautiful. well-manicured lawns, flowers blooming, birds chirping, the whole nine.  also took my new scooter for a test drive this weekend - i'm LOVIN' IT! just fast enough to give me a thrill, not fast enough to be a danger ;)  lots of eye candy on this campus - and it's not even regular session!  husband remains super-supportive: he bought me a new marilyn monroe lunchbox and made sure i got plenty of rest & good food this weekend to prepare me for the new job. it worked! i have slept better than i've slept in months, and am feeling better than i have felt in years. (except the traditional tilt of this keyboard is killing me!)  my afternoon 15 is now over - back to it!

      wow.  in the past, the departure from places of employment felt like an escape, like i was fleeing some dark thing.  that is not the case with this joint . . .  i feel like i am peeling off a layer of old, crusty skin that housed what i was at the beginning of this professional chapter in preparation for a new period of growth.  i can scarce keep still today!  how can i focus on what lingering responsibilities fall to me when i am so very anxious for the challenges that lie ahead?  one of the women in my office made me a homemade card and a small decorative pillow - such a sweet gesture.  i'm moved because i've never before really enjoyed the people i've worked with the way i have here.  *sniff*  just 3.5 hours left . . .

        i'm a taurus.    we're not content until things are comfy, and my blog just isn't quite comfy yet(mostly because i lack the tech skills needed to make it  just  the way i want it.)  i look at  urlLink styro's page  or  urlLink giddy girlie  and am fascinated by how beautiful & fun-ctional they are.  i know it's just a matter of time & education.  speaking of education:  YES!  i did get that job i was gunnin' for!  and they want to sign me up for html & other fun classes!  i'm thrilled! today is my last day & i am starting to feel a little separation anxiety where a few of my soon-to-be-former co-workers are concerned.  i'm going to miss Skip alot.  he's got that warm smile & fun attitude that can make the worst moments bearable. he also says mass or delivers classic rock lyrics when i need them the most.  he's a mad mad percussionist - finding rhythm in everything (oh! that sounds naughty!)  he is a compassionate, warm-hearted, and nature lovin' hillbilly.  it has been a pleasure working with him.   i AM going to miss you, Skippy! thank you for always calling a spade a spade & for being such a good guy.  it's nice to know there are still a few in this world!     goodbye old job! hello new opportunity!  i think i'll celebrate with a little smoking loon tonight . . .

      1. take one brand new human being  2. allow that new human being to explore & revel in the first phases of life, wherein other, more "mature" human beings find the truth that pours from the mouths of new human beings "cute", "funny", and "charming."  3. introduce the not-so-new human being to other human beings.  4. start teaching them about "social boundaries" and "propriety."  5. attempt to hone the natural tendency towards truth into "kindness", "politeness", and "charity."  reward the not-so-new human being for these qualities.  6. raise expectations regarding nearly-fully-formed human being to include "the rat race", "career", and "responsibility."  7. teach that human that "kindness", "politeness", and "charity" now translate into "insincerity" and "alternative motives."   you have now successfully created another kiss-ass , stripped of most of its natural goodness, ready to run out and play "the game."   * yes, it's been a rough week.  i am a truth-telling human being who only gives compliments when & where they are warranted (which others may find too frequent - i figure there's enough sick, disgusting, ugly crap in this world that i may as well celebrate every little good thing i happen upon.) and i am SICK & TIRED of people thinking that i am kissing ass.  if any of them knew me at all, they would know that it is nearly physically impossible for me to kiss ass.  it goes against everything in my nature.  i forgive them for having this misconception, as it is clear that someone or group of someones has beat the truth out of them.   i am excited because i think (read: hope) that i just may have landed myself in a job where my boss & i will have a decent, truthful relationship. relationships such as these aren't always pretty (sometimes the truth isn't pretty, folks) but AT LEAST I KNOW WHAT I AM DEALING WITH!

      I AM THE LUCKIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD!!!  it's true! i have a kickass husband, warm comfy home, great family, loving pets, AND i get to count    urlLink styro    as my friend!  she shared some of her time with us this weekend AND brought wonderful punk rock librarian boyfriend along - BONUS!  she also came bearing gifts, including a sample of her fantastic & recently published glass etching skills, fresh strawberries (YUM!), AND a lovely bouquet of hydrangeas.  we talked and smoked and drank and ate more than we should.  i loved every freaking minute of it!  we so enjoy sharing our home with fun people, and i have to say that styro & company top the list.  i love you, girl!  in other news, the office has finally been told that i'm leaving. my emotions are so mixed! thrilled at the new opportunity, anxious to leave behind some of the stress i've been steeped in for so long, and sad to part ways with some pretty great people.  i was worried that folks were going to start applauding & cheering when they heard the news(i can be a little weird to work with sometimes) but they've just been coming up to me and saying such lovely things.  lucky me.    OH!   you know those great stories that are SO great that you tell everyone you know twice before you realize it has gotten old? since styro & i had been apart for a while, i had the JOY of sharing this one with her for the first time this past weekend, and now   i'll share it with you  , dear reader:  cops are called to a domestic disturbance.  they arrive to find a man sitting curbside and bleeding from the head.  when asked what happened, the man replied:   "i was just trying to get some stank on my hangdown, and the bitch hit me with a smoothie!"   translation? (we made people guess at parties - HYSTERICAL!)  everyone guesses that the "stank" and "hangdown" bits refer to the guy trying to get a little action.  people usually get stumped wondering  how  it is that pureed fruit can cause a man to bleed from the head.    the answer?  a "smoothie" is the thing you "smoove out yer clothes wit."  yeah, you know it's funny ;)

       y'all ready for this? &nbsp; last night i had this dream . . .   sharon h ., who terrorized me in 7th grade because my boobs were bigger than hers (bigger than everybody else's in our class, for that matter),  got a job in my office .&nbsp; she didn't recognize me, and i didn't refresh her memory.&nbsp; she asked if i wanted to have lunch with her, and i said "sure" in the interest of fostering healthy office relationships.&nbsp; uncomfy.  fast forward to the end of my dream day, and i've set up shop to cut hair in my den.&nbsp;  my ex-boyfriend G. knocks at the door and asks for a haircut .&nbsp; i haven't seen him in years, but say "sure" because i pride myself on being one of those girls who can part & still be friends.&nbsp; he curls up in the chair.&nbsp; i notice he looks a little wan, but i don't ask questions.&nbsp; he volunteers that he's happily married to a wonderful woman.&nbsp;  he says he loves her so much that he wears one of her shoes. &nbsp; i look down and, sure enough, he is wearing a patent leather, stacked mary-jane with a ruffled sock on his right foot.&nbsp;    and then i wake up.   i have absolutely no friggin' idea what that all means.&nbsp; the last time i saw G.&nbsp;was when he returned from grad school to inform me that he was dating someone else, and that she looked just like me.&nbsp; he asked for a more recent photograph so he could show her what i looked like.&nbsp;   i said "hell, no!" and then told him to get out of my apartment.  anyone out there dabble in dream analysis?&nbsp; i'm ready &amp; waiting . . .

       so we went to this party last friday night . . .  hosted by one of my husband's co-workers (which means an environment jam-packed with law enforcement!)&nbsp;  i took a bottle of johnny walker black with me , just for kicks.&nbsp; i like to have it neat, with a glass of something non-alcoholic on the side.&nbsp; that night's n-a of choice was ginger ale. &nbsp; i was sitting on the deck having a conversation with a few officers, when one announced she was going inside, and would any of us like anything?&nbsp; she nodded toward my near-empty glass, and i said "yeah, sure.&nbsp; neat, please." &nbsp; she went in, asked folks what i was drinking, took the bottle, and began pouring.&nbsp; by the time by-standers realized what she was doing,  she had poured me a tumbler full of whiskey .&nbsp; they began to scream "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!"&nbsp; she stopped, and then received a lesson on how my kinda liquor that makes a grown man cry. &nbsp;  i laughed, and drank the whole thing .&nbsp; then somebody tried to teach me how to play asshole.&nbsp; i can't tell you how funny THAT was. &nbsp; man, i sure do LOVE whiskey!

       my little cat, my first very own pet, turned 15 this year. &nbsp; she's had a very good life, full of friends and adventure.&nbsp; here's her life now:    she's having little strokes  she's lost a substantial amount of weight  she's now using just&nbsp;about everything as a litterbox  she's going to the vet for another check up. she doesn't seem to be in pain, but the funky little spasms frighten both of us and the pissing is threatening my slice of world peace.&nbsp; add to that the fact that her companion must suffer the same confinement imposed as a result of the piss, and  i am&nbsp;at wit's end .  &nbsp;  advice?&nbsp; suggestions?&nbsp; referral for home for geriatric pets?&nbsp; i don't want to&nbsp;be without her, but fear that love and selfishness are clouding my vision . . . or that my desire to not have everything i own ruined with piss might be as well. please be kind with&nbsp;comments,  my heart is breaking .

      c'mon,  urlLink styro !  enable comments!  you wrote this bang-on post about the chub & then won't let us converse about it!  i JUST had my stepmother ask me  "did you get those test results back yet?"    what she meant was:     "i know you're having health problems & that your doctor is trying to figure it out - any word?"    what i heard was:     "MAN, you've blimped out!  any good excuses? are you on a magic pill to lose those lbs?"   i need to talk about this!  i'm 30-something, 60-something lbs overweight, and i've had a (now ex-) gyno tell me she wouldn't discuss fertility issues until after i'd lost the excess!  i can't seem to make a good habit stick - probably because they never taste as good as a doughnut or feel as good as a lazy day on my sofa with a book or movie. i need to get in shape for physical & mental health reasons aplenty. WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!    i'm TIRED of being FAT!   (but apparently not tired enough.)

      i have to take a break from the AZ story to tell you THIS:  i had a slew of phone calls to make when i got into work this morning (and it's a big meeting/big deadline day, so the boss is anxious.)  around 10:00 AM i got a nasty case of the hiccups.  like my sneezes, my hiccups are not cute or charming or amusing.  they're rude & painful & interrupt my life.  one cannot make important phone calls with the hiccups!  so i went 'round the office asking every mommy in the place for her remedy.   S told me to get a glass of water.    i got a glass of water.    she told me to sip it with my back facing her.    being new & not very trusting in the first place, i hesitated, but eventually did as she asked.    she promptly stuck her fingers in my ears  (over the little piece of cartilage that so many are fond of piercing.)   i was cured in three seconds!   the real test will be when i get the next case of hiccups (or is it "hiccoughs"?)  how's your day going?

      sunday was checkout time.  we paid the bill and headed to the pool for one last dip.  i managed to suppress my goodie-two-shoe issues and get past the fact that we had checked out.  i loved that pool.  after the pool it was into the car and off to flagstaff - and a little cabin in the woods.  did i mention that i'm afraid of the dark?  i am a little crunchy nature girl, as long as the nature is clean and dry and well-lit.  i had a bit of a rough go of it there, but largely enjoyed the cabin experience.  we all had our own sleeping surfaces, which seemed to help a lot.  i was tired, and so passed out and missed the first jaunt into flag.  the divas hooked up with R's lover boy and a few friends.  sorry i missed it, but glad i got to catch up on some sleep!  oops!  have to make a phone call before lunch ends - more later!

       nap time   so i got a little sleepy (and it wouldn't be the first time!) during dinner.   we got back to the hotel, and i passed out while the girls went for pool time & drinks.  i don't remember much of that nap.   alarm!   the girls returned and situated themselves for the night, only to be startled awake by three shrill, sharp bursts of noise.  i pried my eyes open, thought that i was dreaming, and so closed my eyes again, only to have that sacred space of sleep violated repeatedly by that same alarming sound!  the others were softly intoxicated, so i took it upon myself to call the front desk.  had anyone else called?  was there an emergency?  first they sent security to check the floor.  then the security guard check our rooms & removed the batteries (!!!) from our smoke detectors ("if there IS an emergency, please remember to come fetch the girls in 3008!")  lastly, after the noise had successfully rattled all the slumbering beauties, the guard returned to disconnect the electric connection.  we were then able to get some sleep.   entertainment   during the hubbub, the only other person who could really manage to speak two words together was A, who, in a fit of hormones screeched, "GET AWAY FROM ME! JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!"  poor A was sleeping on a mattress by the front door & had to move every time the guard came in.  all this activity sent me into insomniac mode.  i had thought of going to the lobby for a club soda and magazine, but A's mattress blocked my exit, and there was no way i was going to risk rousing her again.  i closed both doors to the twin sink area and spent two hours on the floor with my magazines & a lone cockroach (they grow 'em big in the desert!)  i think the aforementioned nap was the only good sleep had on saturday night in sedona.

       up at the crack   this is nothing new - within 12 hours of landing i was on AZ time and up at the break of day.  luckily, A was as well, and we sprinted out the door for some breakfast.  fell in love with the sedona scramble (eggs scrambled gently with wilted spinach & cream cheese.) and enjoyed a long conversation with my good friend.  luxurious!   SERVICE ME!   we were staying at the sedona hilton inn & spa, so  of course  we had to avail ourselves of all that it had to offer!  i had scheduled a circle-of-life massage with Jeff for noon.  into the spa, sign-in for my robe and locker, change, and then down the hall to "still-point" (where we begin . . . whoooooooo!)  a glass of water with cucumber & lemon, and then Jeff found me & escorted me to a PHAT room!  that particular massage is all about intuitive use of technique on the part of the therapist, and Jeff knew what he was doing.  absolutely lovely, until he got to my hands.  "are you a mother?" he asked. when i said no, he replied "your time is coming. you have a mother's hands."  so that was a little unsettling, yet oddly freeing at the same time.  i enjoyed the rest of the massage (did i mention it was a fabulous 90-minute job?) and then headed back to the room for a shower.   bit of a blur   the rest of the day was a bit of a blur. everyone else had services scheduled at different times.  there was a lot of pool-side action, and some gym time, a little sauna, lunch at one point (a fabulous veggie wrap, although it was big enough to feed a small country!) and then we decided to truck into the town of sedona.  very touristy, but we ate cactus (YUMMY!) and got a little shopping in.  A got a killer hat, which i have lovely photographs of & hope to post here soon.  i hit a weird level of fatigue & got a little loopy over dinner (without alcohol, thank you) and so the girls left me to snooze a little while they went to the pool. i'm sorry i missed that part, but glad i got the sleep that i did, and i'll tell ya why . . . later.   note to my fellow travelers: you'll forgive me, please, but the fatigue & elevation have muddled the timeline for me a bit.  if i get things out of order, i'll try to catch myself & edit ;)

      i am SUCH a lucky girl!  i have so many truly wonderful friends in my life; today i'd like to celebrate hK.  the first thing anyone notices about her is that she is beautiful.  really beautiful.  curvy-petite-goddess-body beautiful.  she's mega-watt smile and green eyes with fringey lashes beautiful, and i say hooray for everyone who enjoys the physical beauty of my friend. there's enough ugly in the world that you should enjoy beauty every time you find it.  if you are lucky, you'll get to talk to her.  it doesn't take much luck, for she is friendly and sweet and easy to talk to.  she's interested and interesting, acquainted with a diverse & fascinating group of people.  she's well-traveled and speaks french nicely, so you'll never want for a topic.  if you're REALLY REALLY lucky (like me), you get to be her friend.  once there, you'll find the beauty is so much more than skin deep.  she is warm and loving.  she is fun - not just the i'm-in-the-right-place-at-the-right-time-wearing-the-right-outfit kind of fun (although she is definitely that as well ;) but the deep down chuckle, facials-and-mani/pedis on a sunday, watch/recite an old favourite movie kind of fun. she's like a sister to me, and if you know me, you know how valuable that really is.  i love you, girl.  thank you for sharing yourself with me - i'm grateful every day that we did finally meet.  my world is a better place for having you in it!  xoxoxoxo

      so i arrive home last night to find two messages from my mom . . .  one let me know that she's increased her minutes on her cell phone (i'm glad she did :)  i could also tell that she's starting to feel a little tech savvy, so that was cute.  the second was all about how she found a "fancy" toothpaste at the dollar store.  my mother could afford bazillion-dollar toothpaste if she wanted it, but the joy of the hunt for a bargain thrills her and frequently takes her to the dollar store.  she LOVES announcing that she's found something cool there.  once, when the family had gathered for a holiday meal, she pulled out two little golfer statues, saying she'd bought them because they reminded her of her golfing brothers.  in the midst of the vintage-this and antique-that decor of her home, my relatives were all wondering what exotic boutique featured this evidently all-american artiste . . .  "you'll never guess what i paid for them."  she said.  - pregnant pause -  "A DOLLAR!" she exclaimed, and we all laughed.  she has a particular way of saying "a dollar" that can get us every time!  i'm so in love with her.

      from the office - you know that feeling when your workspace reaches maximum capacity and you're like "one more person & i'm gonna flip" . . .  i just reached it.  too many cooks in the kitchen, so i thought i'd go blog.  had a lovely lunch with T; we both ate chocolate chip cookies the size of dinner plates!  also looking forward to a visit with E after work.  we have settled into the lazy daze of summer - long walks, bike rides, ice tea, and good times with family & friends.  i think i'm ready to host a barbecue.

       GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE!     had a 1.25 hour conversation with diva A last night, and it did me good.  i usually don't like the phone (having had a job where all i did was answer them & troubleshoot issues, it sometimes feels too much like work to me) but A can make me laugh 'til i'm crying!  her daughter is growing up so fast - it seems like only yesterday i received a picture of her newborn face, and now she's ready for pre-K!   speaking of new babies  - congratulations to our expectant friends L, T, and N and welcome to the new Miss A!!!  also, HELLO, R!  it's good to see you doing so well!  so exciting, all this new, brilliant life on the planet!  i'm glad it's wednesday, though tuesday ended in a happy way - my husband came to meet me at work on his bike so that we could ride home together, and that was a beautiful thing.

          and maybe you do too . . .   why did i turn off the comments on  karma?  because somebody initially had an opinion, which was fine. the problem came in when the opinion turned into bashing of my family & friends. sticks &amp; stones and all that where i am concerned, but please leave my fam & friends out of it.  what floors me is that the person with the opinion keeps coming back and seems to have read more than one entry in my bloggie.  i  certainly don't continue to visit blogs that offend or bore me.  thanks to my husband &amp; friends for their support. thanks even to the person who made me think about that single choice of words. i'm glad i edited it. i hope you can find other blogs that you enjoy reading more than mine.   on a lighter note:   got a new bike yesterday and it sho' is fine! nothing fancy, just one of those cruiser types. it has shocks all over the place, so it feels like you're floating. add that to my garage full of transport options :)  also, b & i enjoyed watching hot wet american summer with janeane garofalo &amp; david hyde pierce. mad crush on dhp. AWESOME suggestion, E.!

       after reflecting on the post from yesterday & the commentary that ensued, i elected to change one word of the original entry out of kindness.  that is all i intend to change.  i felt the original word was, in fact, a bit harsh, in light of the recent events.        it is important for family & friends who read this blog to note that i never use names or identify places of residence/employment.  this is to protect the privacy of those mentioned in my writing and my own privacy.  it is important for people who don't know me to realize that this is effectively my diary, emphasis on the fact that it is mine.  i welcome debate & commentary as long as it is not abusive.  i also reserve the right to ditch your comments if you start acting like a jerk on my pages.  make a big enough jerk of yourself, and i will leave your comments up for the entertainment of my readers.      thank you, vocal reader, for provoking me to re-examine that one word.

      there was this woman who came to work at my old office . . . she was a tad older than i, and she had a very friendly and warm personality. we seemed to have a lot in common. we shared lunches & shopping trips &amp; a good laugh now and then.  she had made a more-than-a-co-worker gesture during the first few weeks of her employment, and i thought that perhaps a friendship was developing.  i began to extend personal invitations to her (not something i normally do - being an intensely private person & afraid of strangers) i.e. if i knew her husband was away on business, i would invite her down for movies &amp; popcorn, or out for dinner. she repeatedly blew off my invitations, until finally i asked if she was ever interested in a friendship outside of work. after much hemming & hawing, she admitted that she only wanted a friendly-professional relationship. i stopped extending the invitations, and we continued with (what i had thought was) a lovely professional relationship.  when i accepted the new job offer, she acted surprised and sad.  i thanked her for making my work environment a more pleasant place and wished her well.  before i left, i wrote on a future page in her daily calendar "i've been gone a week - give me a call or drop me a line :)"  fast forward to last friday, a month and a half into the new job. i had dinner with Miss C from the old office. she told me that that woman had reached that page in her calendar, walked up to Miss C and said, "i'm not calling her; i'm not into her like that."    whatever that meant.    what it meant to me was that i had misjudged yet another person's character. i was disappointed, but not permanently damaged. i expressed my disappointment to my friend, and then moved on to other topics of conversation. it was a LOVELY time.  this morning i received an email from Miss C - "call me when you get this."   that woman's husband had a heart attack over the weekend.   i sent that woman an email extending prayers &amp; support, because that's the kind of person i am. after sending that email, i counted my blessings and returned to the mail merge i was working on. Miss C sent me an email, and we have, by turns, mused over the great cosmic "why" and the wonders of the office environment.
