      I haven't died people..at least not yet. It's currently 2:30am and I just got home and get to stay here long enough to shit, shower and shave. Literally. In a few I'll be off to lovely Alabama and if I'm lucky I'll get to come straight home afterwards but something tells me I'll have to go pick sugar up in Louisiana. Ugh! I haven't slept more than 3 straight hours since Sunday so I feel like a zombie but it isn't anything a six pack of red bull can't take care of. Time to go. Adios fuckers!

      Fucking trains! A train loaded with coal derailed while passing over I-57 in Illinois and dumped something like 800 tons of coal onto the freeway. It was shutdown, my truck overheated, lots of traffic, I get cranky. Needless to say I wasn't having a good day and I really don't like when it takes 9 hours to go a distance that should only take 3 hours. This is all I'm saying because I am off to bed and don't plan on waking up till dinner time tomorrow. Adios.

      what to do with myself sometimes. I drive myself totally insane by constantly thinking about things. Driving a truck doesn't help either as I have a ton of time to think. I'm not going to say much right now, other than I've had a totally shitty week. Thank God I only have to make a short trip tomorrow.  I did change the template to something a little less lame and even though I don't care much for the colors I'm leaving it this way cause I'm too lazy to figure out how to change shit. Ciao fuckers!

      Welcome to my new home. The gayest looking blog with stupid dots and home interior colors! I'm too lazy to do anything with it right now so wait like a week or so and I might have something up if I don't do anything with it tomorrow.

      It would seem as if I have a target hovering above my head that says, "fuck with me please!". I say this because for the second week in a row I've been pulled off one load and put onto another one with no notice whatsoever. Last week I was supposed to go to Louisville but instead I get sent out to Pennsylvania and where I had to go was about 16 hours away and I was told I had to go there with only 14 hours before my appointment time. Thank God I can cheat and make my truck haul ass thus making it on time with only 5 minutes to spare. I later made a mad dash to California and back for a grand total of around 6000 miles for last week which although it sucked driving all that, I'll get paid handsomely for it. Now on to this week's first trip. I was to leave around 5 this morning to head down to Miami. Well wouldn't you know it when I show up to pick up my load I get informed by the guy at our distribution center that the load was cancelled on FRIDAY!! and yet nobody had the courtesy to inform me of this. So hear I am at 5 in the morning ready to go when I'm informed of where I've been rescheduled to go and where is it?! To goddamn Evansville, IN. A whopping three hours away and the load won't be ready till midnight so now I'm back at home, obviously, sitting on my ass for the next few hours waiting to leave. I really don't mind getting dropped from one load and going to another since that is part of the job but goddamnit, a little notice would be nice once in awhile, especially when they knew it was cancelled two days before I was supposed to leave.  On the upside, I did have time to go and blow some money over at Best Buy. I bought parts 1 and 2 to Kill Bill and a few cd's. Which reminds me, a few weeks ago I went out and bought a Franz Ferdinand cd and got some free cd to go with it. Now normally these freebies are total shit and consist of artists you've never heard of for quite obvious reasons but not this one. This one is titled "Get out and rock" or something like that and I must say it is fucking awesome. I don't have the cd handy, otherwise I'd list all the bands on it, but some of the ones I can remember are Franz Ferdinand, Modest Mouse, Los Lonely Boys and some others that I have in my head but can't seem to get them out. Anyways, it's good and I suggest you people go find it.  In other news, Jill and I got ourselves a gym membership yesterday to a gym that is opening up in a few weeks. I now need to get going on stuffing my face full of whatever bad foods I can seeing as how I'll need to start eating healthy once I start working out. I'll also have to make sure I don't work out that much with Jill so that I can check out all the other hot sweaty chicks at the gym without worrying about weights getting chucked at my head when she catches me looking. This should be easily avoided though considering our work schedules but I'm sure the weekends will be saved for our precious together time. -insert eye rolling- Well I'm off to go have dinner with Jill and her folks and then maybe actually get to drive somewhere tonight. Adios fuckers!

      I'm starting to dislike this blogger deal now that it takes me 20 minutes to log into the fucker. Not to mention it keeps double posting everything I do now which gives me even more reason to go buy a domain and make myself do twice as much work updating everything. I'm totally bitching about something stupid but who cares. I slept like major shit last night, not to mention I had the shit scared out of me this morning at around 3am. It would seem Jill thought it wise to sneak into my house and hop into bed with me. Wrong!! I was not expecting it and she pounced on my bed just as I was falling to sleep causing me to think I was being attacked and damn near cleaning her clock with a heavy duty flashlight. After my heart rate returned to earth and picking up whatever I knocked over in the confusion, we went to bed where I proceeded to toss and turn all night.  Now that she's gone off to work I can finally get some shit done around here and hit the road sometime today. I'm debating on whether or not I should take a nap now or drive halfway to Louisville and then take a nap. Am I getting old or what? I'm actually trying to decide whether to take a nap. Fuck life sucks at times! Maybe I'll just go to bed now and stay there for the rest of the week. Sounds good to me! Zzzzz

      "Fuck no!" is what I should have said when asked this question today. Instead I agreed to drive and somehow ended up spending the next six hours at the goddamn mall. I don't think I've spent that much time at any mall ever in my entire life. I can now see why they wanted to use my truck as the backseat was filled with a ton of bags, of which only one small one belonged to me. I bought a new pair of shoes so I can get them dirty within a week.  After the mall we went to dinner. Thank fucking Christ! I didn't know standing around watching two women shop could be so tiring and make me so damn hungry. I don't recall tasting my food as it was gone in about 5 minutes. We followed dinner up with a movie of my choosing which was The Bourne Supremacy. Pretty good movie, especially for a sequel. The girls wanted to go shoot pool but I'm old now and I need more sleep these days so I took them home, got a goodnight smooch from one of them which is the most action I've gotten from her since we started dating. I swear my hand puts out more but oh well, I dig her and she's smart as hell which is like major bonus points for me.  She earned even bigger points earlier in the day when we ran into my ex and she just let my ex be her normal idiot self and say what she had to say and didn't say anything except, "It was nice meeting you but we must go visit with some grownups now." It was one of those had to be there moments but I still found it hysterically amusing and was howling with laughter when we walked off. Not to mention I looked like a pimp with two chicks by my side. Unfortunately neither of them is giving it up to me so I felt more like a pimple. I'm sure I'll get laid again someday though when I convince her to let go of her morals. Till then I'll keep up the sweetness shit and be my usual gentlemanly self.  Fuck I'm totally rambling again. So yeah, I think I'm going to buy a domain name yet again but actually put forth the effort and turn it into something decent. I might even reveal more crap about myself too. Even if all I do is post about shit nobody wants to know or waste their life reading I find this to be the only way to get just get shit out. Everytime I try to talk to someone in person I almost inevitably just want to reach out and hit them when they respond with some useless cliche remark and if people keep telling me "someone always has it worse", I'm going to run them all over with my truck.  Tomorrow I'm off for back to back trips for Louisville which should make for a quick first half to the week. Only down side to it is the drive is boring as hell but hey, that's what hauling ass is for isn't? Adios meatheads!

      The funk legend known as Rick James, died today of "natural causes". He'll be missed by many people I'm sure. Just not by me.  What a fantastic update this was! More at 11! Oops, it's past 11 now. Tune in tomorrow then. Peace out homies.

      I'm sure you are all waiting with great anticipation for my next post of greatness. Well fuck off cause it ain't gonna happen right now. I swear to God if one more person cuts me off while driving or even speaks to me in a different language, I'm going to run them over repeatedly. I just spent two days in the great state of Mississippi. What a fucking shithole that place is man. I like black people just fine but the mother fuckers down there apparently missed the day they gave out brains and the ability to drive and speak english. I don't get nor do I understand ebonics. Just because your pal can understand what you said, does not mean my cracker ass will understand it.  Anyways, I have  a ton of shit to say and get off my chest but for now I need to go to Wisconsin. Hopefully I'll get along better with the pollocks up there. Maybe I'll post something worth reading when I get back. Adios mofo's!
