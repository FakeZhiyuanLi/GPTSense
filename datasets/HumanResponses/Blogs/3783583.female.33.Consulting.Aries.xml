      My dear Lizzie-friend leaves tomorrow for a week with her dad and as I sit here tonight thinking about a week without her, I realize that she really is my best friend in town.  I begin to wonder at the idea that I could now be so close to someone of whom I was so envious upon meeting.  It is remarkable that I could be in the constant company of someone so great, so meaningful to me that she almost disappears into the fabric of my life.  So tonight I have decided to give her her due attention by thinking about the things I love about her.     ELIZABETH (aka Petunia)...    1.  She is beautiful without being vain.   (I am not beautiful and quite vain)  Beauty is a two-edged sword--ask any woman in our society.  To not be beautiful is to be an outsider, to be less-than, and (sometimes) to be pitied.  To be  too  beautiful is to be assumed vulgar, stupid, without merit and, ironically, to be an outsider.  Elizabeth manages to be beautiful by every conventional standard and yet draw people to her instantly.  She is loved rather than envied, admired rather than scoffed.     2.  She has a quiet, tender heart.   I realized the clear evidence of this one day after I finished a scathing tirade about a mutual acquaintance--I was critical and teasing and somewhat cruel.  She laughed without comment and we moved on to other topics.  Suddenly I realized that not once have I ever heard her make a critical or unkind remark about anyone.  Not once in the 12 years I have known her!  Elizabeth has a tender heart that sincerely cares about and seeks out the best in most everyone.     3.  She dares to be imperfect.   She is willing to share weaknesses and imperfections and I marvel at this since I am in constant fear of being found out weak.  Liz isn't afraid of what other people think--she is just willing to be Liz.  And through her willingness to be herself, imperfections and all, I have learned the most remarkable thing about friendship--that love is love, mistakes and all.   4.  She is supportive.   She joys in my joys.  She triumphs in my triumphs.  She is sad in my sadness.  She walks  with  me, sometimes pointing the way ahead, sometimes reminiscing about the way behind, sometimes just being.   5.  She loves to laugh.   There is nothing better than finding a way to make Elizabeth laugh.  It is one of the things in life that brings me so much joy--talking on the phone with her and getting her to laugh.    What a treasure I have with a "Lizzie-friend" in my life.  I am such a better person for it.

      To hear Sharon Olds read this poem is quite remarkable.  She was interviewed by Terry Gross on Fresh Air (www.npr.org) several years ago and they had a wonderful conversation about revealing the personal in public poems.  Is the poem interesting because it's true--because it's really about her parents?  Or is it interesting because, as Sharon says, it "jumps the fence a bit"?     My  question is this--is it the poem itself or these questions which make the poem so fascinating?   I Go Back to May 1937 (from The Gold Cell)   By Sharon Olds   I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges,  I see my father strolling out under the ochre sandstone arch, the  red tiles glinting like bent  plates of blood behind his head, I  see my mother with a few light books at her hip  standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks with the  wrought-iron gate still open behind her, its  sword-tips black in the May air, they are about to graduate, they are about to get married,  they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is they are innocent, they would never hurt anybody. I want to go up to them and say Stop,  don't do it--she's the wrong woman,  he's the wrong man, you are going to do things  you cannot imagine you would ever do,  you are going to do bad things to children, you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of,  you are going to want to die. I want to go  up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it, her hungry pretty blank face turning to me, her pitiful beautiful untouched body,  his arrogant handsome blind face turning to me, his pitiful beautiful untouched body, but I don't do it. I want to live. I  take them up like the male and female  paper dolls and bang them together  at the hips like chips of flint as if to  strike sparks from them, I say Do what you are going to do, and I will tell about it.

      Since my life, it seems, is largely defined by the books I have or am currently reading, I could think of no better way to begin than by considering some of the books that have been lately on my mind.  They are not necessarily my top ten (especially since there are actually eleven listed) but they are the ones I have read recently enough to have been impacted by or have had fun with.  One, "The Sparrow," I read over and over again.  Another, "Walking on Water," I have been reading for nearly 10 years without finishing, usually biting off a morsel to savor for months or even a year at a time before delving back in.     Books for the Moment  ~ "The Sparrow" by Maria Doria Russell ~ "The White Bone" by Barbara Gowdy ~ "The Island of Lost Maps" by Miles Harvey ~ "The Dance of the Dissident Daughter" by Sue Monk Kidd ~ "The Cliff Walk" by Don J. Snyder ~ "Sixpence House: Lost in a Town of Books" by Paul Collins ~ "Faith Thinking" by Trevor Hart ~ "The Eyre Affair" by Jasper Fforde ~ "Orbitting the Giant Hairball" ~ "One Writer's Beginnings" by Eudora Welty ~ "Walking on Water" Madeleine L'Engle

      It is fascinating the way business brings out the best masks in people.  We interview for a job and put on our "best face".  We go on sales calls and put on our "face to the customer".  We meet with our boss and put on  our "whatever-you-want-boss face".  Why is it that with all the richness within us we find it so compelling to hide beneath the face of the mundane?    Countless books have been written on being creative, free, different...on being "you" at work. Unfortunately, more often than not, reality proves these books to be little more than lovely fairy tales.  In the real world, being a free spirit means finding yourself free of a job.  Speaking truth, rather than the company line, means finding yourself out of the loop and just out reach of good projects, development opportunities and promotions.  Oh yes, you can be yourself, as long as "yourself" is politically correct, in full agreement with the boss and completely willing to morph into the company mascot.    Where exists these companies raved about in the best-sellers lining the Business section of Barnes & Noble?  Companies where good, ordinary, talented people can lead rich business lives without becoming a clone of the CEO?  Where people can voice their opinions even if it is contrary to management's norm.  Do they exist outside the borders of the Land of Make-Believe?  And if so, do you know the way there?
