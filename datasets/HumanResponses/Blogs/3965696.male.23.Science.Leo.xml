      Here's an  urlLink article  (skim, don't read) on why cool cell phones, and the people who use them, will be the death of the consumer electronics industry. I've already ditched my old PDA in favor of using the address book and calendar in my phone, but it'll be a long time before a phone can rival my  urlLink iPod , my  urlLink GameBoy , or my  urlLink digital camera . Then again, I don't carry my GameBoy or my camera around very often.   I thought this  urlLink lego version of Spider-Man 2  was pretty cool.   Those of you who have blogs should set up an account with  urlLink FeedBurner  so that my newsreader can alert me when you update, and I can spend less time checking to see if you've updated. It supports both RSS and atom standards, which is nice (since I haven't found a free newsreader that supports atom, which is what all blogger offers). The news feed keeps track of when a web page is updated, and by running a newsreader program, you can keep an eye on which sites have new content. It's a great timesaver, and will improve the effeciency of my laziness.   As per my previous promise, here's the view out the closest window to my office:     MD Anderson is more or less in the center of the picture, then, to the right, is the University of Texas Health Science Center, and, on the far right, the tip of the Jewish wing of Baylor College of Medicine.   And, here's my desk:     On the far right is my 20 oz. plastic water glass, which I use to minimize the trips to the water cooler (a good fifty yards away). I'm averaging about four a day right now. In the center is the flat panel monitor I'm using until my ultra-cool flat panel monitor comes in. Further to the left are my iPod and headphones, and on the far left is our lab's server, which I could unplug if I wished to plunge the lab into chaos. I am Ward, fear me.

      Some of you may enjoy this video of  urlLink Segway Polo . There's some nice wipeouts.   I picked my car up from the Toyota place today, and everything's back to normal in that department. I think my lab computer's due to ship tomorrow, and hopefully I'll get it next week.   The new first-year graduate students (and medical students, and physician's assistants in training, etc.) are here this week for orientation. On the first day, they take a headshot of every one of the graduate students and then print up a pictoral roster so that you may identify your classmates. However, this is only distributed to the first-years, and perhaps some of the administrators and professors. I need a chance to look it over to see what's going on in terms of the ladies, and preferrably soon, but I'm trying to avoid looking (being?) desperate. Here are my options:   * Wait for our administrator, Wanda, to get her copy framed and posted on the wall in her office * Hope one of the new students rotate in our lab and then ask them to see the roster. This apparently happened to Graham last year, and may even be a time-honored tradition. Graham requested that if I did this that I scan it and send him a copy * Corner a first-year in a dark alley and mug them for their copy  It'd be nice to have access to this before we (I assume) have our annual back-to-school night of free beer at  urlLink Valhalla , the Rice graduate student pub.   Kennedy, a girl that Graham has been seeing, has decided that she wants to set me up with a friend of hers (Fiona?). Graham has never met this girl, Kennedy has seen me exactly three times, and she and I have had zero substantial conversations. Frankly, I'm a bit scared. I hadn't been planning on looking super-sexy tomorrow, either, but I guess that doesn't take a whole lot of extra effort.   It occurred to me that my camera phone should be playing a bigger role in providing blogging content. I'll try to get on that.

      Earlier today, I gave Sabrina points for her impressive AP Biology recall abilities. That was a mistake. She deserved more.   That brings me to the ancient tradition of bestowing Ninja Points. Ninja Points can never be bought or sold, but may only be earned and bestowed. Whenever somebody says or does something sufficiently impressive, clever, funny, intelligent, insightful, or ballsy (or the female equivalent thereof)—something of blinding brilliance—you may bestow Ninja Points upon them. One is often enough, but some occasions may necessitate two, three, or in some cases, as many as five ninja points.   Ninja Points can be redeemed by using your special ninja abilities—hang from the ceiling, bounce off walls, move with blinding speed, disappear into the shadows, or even call upon mystical fire to smite your enemies.   Ninja Points: know them, bestow them, use them. Sabrina, I hereby honor you with two Ninja Points.   The lab is beginning to look like the day after Christmas. There are two new grad students in the lab (including me) and one new post doc. They've both gotten new computers and monitors, and my two beautiful hunks of aluminum ( urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2 ) are due to ship on Friday. We had an IBM ThinkPad show up today (for general lab use) along with an accompanying Sony 20" LCD, and a PowerBook is on the way as well.   I'm experiencing the joys of debugging—I've got two scripts to analyze some data, and the results they produce are inconsistent, so I get to stare at two windows full of small text for hours on end, until I realize, in a flash of brilliance, "Hey! There should be a semicolon there!" Semicolons: the cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems.   I'm also working on this fall's upcoming qualifying exam. On September 1, I have to submit three one page abstracts of proposals for novel research, unrelated to the work I do in lab. My committee will pick one, and I will have until mid-October to turn it into a full NIH-style grant proposal, which I'll have to deffend orally, and then never think about again.   I guess it would make too much sense to, say, give me time to get an actual paper published which would advance my scientific career. Way too much sense.

      Saturday, once I caught up on sleep (1:00), and did the typical things I do on any given morning before leaving the house (bathe, cloth, etc.), I gathered up my laundry and went to my aunt and uncle's to do laundry. It's a good excuse to get some quality driving time in (very therapeutic), get away from my area of town for a bit, do some reading, and often times I get dinner out of the deal, too. We went to  urlLink this place . They've got their little microbrewery on site, and though I won't give it too much credit since it's a chain of microbreweries, I ordered the seven beer sampler (two ounces each, maybe?) along with my buffalo chicken pizza (disappointing—a bit weak on the hot sauce).   I came back to my place and had a choice between going bowling with Dan and co. (my concert-going friends) or going to see  The Bourne Supremacy  with Nathan and Melissa (of the Cellular and Molecular Biology program at school) and their friends. Since I was horribly sore from the dancing (maybe that'll discourage me next time), I opted for the choice that had me sitting on my ass for a couple of hours. The movie was thoroughly mediocre. I hand enjoyed the first one—though it was nothing special, it was entertaining enough—but the second one was just not particularly interesting or exciting.   I was supposed to catch up with Dan &c. at a bar afterwards, but he couldn't hear his cell phone, so I went over to Woodrow's to hang out with Will. He'd the door man there on Fridays and Saturdays, so it's pretty dependable that he's a) there and b) bored. I know the bartenders through him, and they're kind of cute, so it's not a bad way to kill an evening.   After they closed, we went for food. I had no idea that  urlLink La Tapatia  was open until all hours of the night, but it's really an exciting discovery. Bryan and Lisa recently introduced me to it recently; it's reasonably authentic, cheap, good, and they put these nifty little marinated carrots on the table with the chips and salsa. It reminds me of that place that's next door to IHOP in Waco. My quesadilla rocked, and there were leftovers for lunch today. The place was absolutely hopping at 3:00 AM when we were there.   I went to Dan's to watch Six Feet Under tonight, since my normal HBO source (Lisa) was unavailable. Win and Thom first turned me onto that, and though I think it's sort of been downhill since the third season began (currently in season four), I see glimpses of hope tht keep my watching (and sometimes driving half-way to Katy to see it). I'm currently doing my Wardlogging and enjoying the wonder that is Adult Swim. There's not a day that goes by when I don't say a prayer of thanks for "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" and "Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law".   Sorry about the relatively boring posts. I'll try to limit it to more entertaining stuff in the future, but I thought some background on my rockin' life here in Houston would give events some nice context. Until then, picture me dancing to make up for it. That should entertain you for a while.

      This, perhaps, will shock and amaze some of you, but it can be hard to get budding biologists out of the lab for a night of fun. At this point, most of the kids in my year are done with classes, so we go into lab in the morning (or afternoon), do some stuff, see the people that work in our general proximity, and then leave in the afternoon (or evening, or morning). There are some people whom I see on a regular basis because we're in the habit of doing things together, but there are a lot of people whom I don't yet know well, and no longer see in the course of a normal week at school.   Thankfully, David of the genetics program has consistently arranged an end-of-term happy hour at  urlLink Brian O'Neill's . It's sort of a half and half mix of Cricket's and Treff's. It's not one of my favorite places; this being a real city, there are bars with more character and better atmostphere, but I can't be too picky at this point. So we show up at 9:00, get a ticket for a free drink, and get extended happy hour pricing until 11:00. The turnout, while not what I hope, is usually decent, and it serves its purpose.   So, the evening's going well, and I've had three Shiners, two gin and tonics, a tequila and tonic, a whiskey and coke, and a shot of Southern Comfort (always reminds me of Paris and London with Rebecca last summer) with lime juice, provided in a glowing shot glass (containing glow stick technology, I think) by the SoCo liquor reps. Happy hour pricing ends, and there is talk of moving the party to a different venue. One group was in favor of  urlLink the Ginger Man , which I'm rather fond of. It seems like the kind of bar where graduate students would hang out (but in a good way), and has lots of beer on tap. The other group was mainly girls, and they wanted to go to  urlLink the Red Star  to go dancing.   Now I don't dance under most normal circumstances. It's really better for myself and others that way. Nobody gets hurt; nobody gets embarassed. However, sometimes, you have to go where the ladies are. So, Friday night, I learned how many drinks and how many cute girls it takes to get me out on the dance floor (well, with their power combined, at least). Those numbers are eight (well, nine after we got the club and girl A suggested that I needed a drink) and five, respectively. This, folks, is big.   So, taking two cars, we went downtown to the club. It wasn't  horribly  objectionable. Sad thing was, out of our group, I seemed to be the least inhibited person out there. There were two other guys with us. They were all just standing in a circle, dancing. I made an effort to actually dance  with  the girls. Turns out, they're all pretty shy, which shouldn't surprise me, but this is another example of being disappointed when people reinforce stereotypes.   There were some entertaining happenings. After we had parked, girl B left the car to flag down the other car, and since the neighborhood was a bit sketchy, I went with her at the request of the others in the car. She was talking to the other car on the cell phone, and informed them that she didn't know why I was with her, since she was a former kickboxer and could probably kick my ass (which might be true; she's about my size). I also had the following conversation with girl A:   Me: "You're surprisingly shy out there on the dance floor. I thought you were into this sort of thing." B: "I can't really dance." Me: "You were a cheerleader in high school. How can you not know how to dance?" B: "How did you know that? Nobody's supposed to know about that!" Me: "You told me. At your birthday party. You were drunk." B: "Well, keep that quiet." Me: "OK. But I still have complete faith in your dancing ability."  And she could dance, as long as it was by hereself. Or even with me, for about thirty seconds, until she got embarassed.   Oh well. I impressed myself by trying, anyway.   Also, thankfully, these people know that after the bars close, you go to Taco C. Even though there was complaining from people who had planned on getting up early to go into lab, I feel like I accomplished something.

      Having but a few days ago signed a new lease on my apartment, it occurs to me that I should probably have a nifty name for it. Casa de Ward doesn't seem entirely appropriate, as it's not a house. The Ward Pad? Ward Central? The Ward Cave? Ward's Palace of Love? Ward's House of Pies? Let me know your thoughts on what to call it.   Also, Rebecca challenged me to come up with a name for her current car (Camry, '99, dark red, sedan, sun roof, leather). I've not got any ideas. Sabrina's been referring to it as Becca #3, as it's the third car she's had since turning 16—her accord lasted a couple of years before Dad totaled it, then her first Camry made it a year and half before she totaled it, and now she's on the new Camry. Suggestions?   I started things rolling on getting the car taken care of today. The auto glass place is supposed to call me shortly, once they've acquired the proper piece of glass. After that, we'll need to make a decision about car alarms (do they still sell those that will send a deadly electrical current coursing through the body of the car?), and then I can get the stereo and the plastics taken care of. Thankfully, I have a spare car for a couple of weeks, so now's the time to have the Camry Mark II out of commission.   I finally got all the pieces together for my new nifty wireless network/music system, and it works wonderfully. I'm currently rocking out with Fountains of Wayne, and whatever else my computer's random number generator deems appropriate. And, I've got two less long, ugly cords running the length of my apartment from my computer to the cable outlet and stereo. I can even control it the music from my phone. Sweet.

      I just discovered that my car was broken into. Again.   It's almost exactly the same, too. Once again, they failed to get anything valuable, wasting both their time and mine. They once again smashed the small, rear, passenger-side window, let themselves in, tried to pull my stereo out, failed (miserably), stole my faceplate, and messed up the plastic molding around the stereo. Fuckers.   But this time, it was at my apartment complex. Back in March, I was in Montrose, where lots of shady people roam, to see a band play, parking was scarce, and I ended up on a poorly-lit residential street a couple of blocks from the bar. This time, I was parked in well-lit, covered parking close to the building. At least I know where to go to get the glass repaired. And this time, despite my opposition to the noise pollution, I guess I'll be purchasing a car alarm.   I'm currently waiting on Houston's Slowest to come by and file a report. Last time, they did it over the phone. It didn't inspire a ton of confidence, but at least it was quick.   Honestly. This is going to cost a $50 deductable. I wish the persons responsible would have simply contacted me, and I could have given them the $50 to save themselves and me the trouble. Then I would beat them (I'm a pacifist, but a bad one). It could have been so much simpler...

      So the new phone's here. First, pictures:     Side by side, the new phone and the old phone. That's the new one on the left and the old one on the right.     More comparison shots.     I call this one "phone sex".   So, cool things. First, it's a camera phone. The pictures are small and bad, but it's still hot. Second, it supports the new GSM band and so gets much better reception. Third, bigger screen. Fourth, it's not a flip phone. Fourth, it does polyphonic ring tones, so I can download, say, the theme to Zelda 2 in midi (thanks Bryan) and have it as my ring. And most importantly, it's got Bluetooth wireless and will sync with my calendar and address book on my computer.   It rocks.   The wireless card adapter is in Houston, but the USPS wouldn't deliver it without my signature. Never mind that every other service will just take it to the office. That's just too damn much to ask, apparently. I'll have to wait until I can pick it up tomorrow for hot wireless digital music action.   Wednesday night is Big Ass Beer Night at Little Woodrow's in the village—24 oz. beers for $1.75—and thus a traditional gathering time for many of us at BCM. I'll probably head that way in a little bit. Perhaps I'll have some more entertaining story to post as a result.

      Rebecca and her friend Kelly departed Houston on a flight to Amsterdam yesterday, and I was tasked with ferrying them to the airport. They picked me up from school, and then I drove Rebecca's car. Now Rebecca's got a '99 Camry, and while I certainly wouldn't claim that it's a high-performance automobile, it's a huge improvement from the '94 that I drive, and much better suited to Houston traffice. It's nice to be able to change lanes knowing that you have enough acceleration to keep from getting run over.   So we took highway 59 to the airport. We were driving along, and it occurred to me: there are three of us in this car. That's a rather high amount of occupancy, which makes us... a high occupancy vehicle!  Obviously, I took the next available entrance into the HOV lane. I'd never driven in one before, but it was hot. It was like the glorious feeling I got the first time I hit the tollway, but better. It's a nice, wide, luxurious lane, with concrete barriers. We saw two other cars in the lane during the entire trip (sadly, I was behind them and had to slow down for them), but mostly, it was like having my own private road. We even had our own, special exit for the airport. It was so hot; so, so hot. I felt sorry for all the losers driving on the normal road.   More electronics showed up yesterday. I had ordered an  urlLink Airport Express  from Apple, and it arrived, along with some assorted cabling I needed to go with it. It's basically a small wireless base station (which in and of itself is of limited use until I get a laptop), but you can also hook it up to your stereo and play music wirelessly from your computer, all with a beautifully pure, digital optical connection. Sadly, I haven't gotten to try it out yet, because, though I have the wireless card to put in the iMac, I don't have the additional adapter for the wireless card that goes in the iMac. Today, hopefully, USPS willing. There'll be a writeup on my music page when I've played with it a bit.   Also, my phone's due to arrive today.   Last night, I accompanied Stephanie and Jennifer to a  urlLink They Might Be Giants concert . I'm not a huge fan, but I like them well enough. The opening act was  urlLink Corn Mo , and his "Meatloaf playing accordion singing songs about junior high" act was fairly entertaining, as was his rendition of "We Are the Champions" and his story of how he quit his day job to play accordion. They Might Be Giants were relatively entertaining, and played such classics as "Why Does the Sun Shine", "Birdhouse in Your Soul", and "James K. Polk" as well as a song about the venue they performed in (they've been writing one for each show) and the theme to "Malcolm in the Middle." An enjoyable show, although the venue staff was a bit green, and, being on the second floor, I was afraid that it was going to collapse due to the combined weight of the entire audience pogo-ing, which reminds me of that Onion article, "500 Record Store Clerks Feared Dead After Roof Collapses At Yo La Tango Concert". I would link to it, but, in one of the greatest tragedies of our age, the Onion's archives are no longer free.

      Around 9:00 last night, I realized that I had accomplished everything useful that I was going to accomplish on my Monday. So, I thought I'd try to find something worthwhile to do. First, though, I watched Teen Titans. I love the Cartoon Network.   So at 9:30, I called Stephanie (first year grad student in developmental biology at BCM, lives in my complex).   Stephanie: "What's up?" Me: "I'm bored." Stephanie: "So am I." Me: "So what are we going to do?" Stephanie: "We could have sex." Me: "Stop being a tease. You've already told me you're not attracted to me. So what are we going to do?" Stephanie: "Yeah, but you're so pathetic I just might give in." Me: "I don't need your pity. So what are we doing tonight?" Stephanie: "I don't know, there's nothing to do in Houston." Me: "Well, what would you have done in San Francisco?" Stephanie: "Gone and hung out at a coffee house." Me: "We have coffee houses here."  So we called Melissa (first year grad student in cell and molecular biology here at BCM), whose husband is out of town), confirmed that she, too, was bored, and after I had established that we would have to go to an establishment that also had alcohol available, took off for  urlLink Onion Creek , or "The O. C." as they call it (not sure, but I think that one's taken).   Anyway, I really like the place. It's got more of a coffee house feel than a bar feel, but yet it still serves beer. I had a snakebite and a bloody harry (bloody mary mix and beer—surprisingly good). And Melissa and I split a mini pizza. Stephanie, despite her talk about how much she wanted hot chocolate, ended up with cake. The girls there were pretty cute too.   Midway through beer number two (the final one of the evening), Stephanie asked if she was going to have to drive home. In her mind, if there's one drop of alcohol in my blood, it renders me utterly incapable of any sort of fine motor control. Despite the number of times I've tried to explain to her the concept of the "legal limit" and shown her Bryan's BAC calculator, it doesn't seem to have taken. Thankfully, I made it home without causing any death and/or destruction.

      So now's the part that will be particularly boring to my female readership (which may very well be everybody at this point). I'll soon be acquiring several new pieces of electronics. Think of it like getting a new pair of cute shoes.   I've had my Sony Ericsson  urlLink T68i  since this time last year, and though I like it, the reception is less than good, and it's getting a bit dated at this point. Its newer siblings are available free to new subscribers of tMobile, Cingular, and AT&T through Amazon.com in exchange for a one year contract. If AT&T wanted to keep me as a customer, they could give me the same deal they're offering their new customers. So, I called customer service. After twenty minutes on hold:   Me: "Yes, my contract is almost up, and I'm interested in renewing it in exchange for a new phone, the  urlLink T637 ." AT&T: "Let me see what kind of price I can get for you on that. Can I put you on hold?" Me: "Sure." AT&T: "OK, I can get that for you for $200 with a one year contract, or $150 with a two year contract." Me: "Both you and Cingular offer that phone for free to new customers. Can you do any better?" AT&T: "Let me check and see if there are any additional rebates... OK, I can get you an additional $50 off." Me: "That's still way to much. Unless you can do better, I'm going to take my number to Cingular." AT&T: "I'm sorry, sir, that's all I can do." Me: "Could you tell me when my contract is up then?"  I had a second conversation that proceded in a manner very similar to the first one (including the twenty minutes on hold). Last night, I called once again. After twenty minutes on hold:   Me: "Yes, I'd like to know when my contract runs out." AT&T: "Could I ask why you want to know that?" Me: "I'm unhappy with my current phone and would like to switch to Cingular since they have the phone I want for free." AT&T: "Would you be willing to sign a one year contract if we matched that offer?" Me: "Cingular only requires a one year contract." At&T: "OK, we can do that."  I don't know if my approach was just different enough this time to elicit a different response, or if it was the representatitive I spoke with, or what, but I was quite pleased. I thought for a while I might have to call in Customer Service Sabrina. So, in the end, I saved myself the trouble of porting my number, paying for the phone up front, and filling out rebates; they're even fedexing it to me. That rocks.

      Do you ever have those nights when you wish your brain just had an off switch, when you wish your thoughts would just stop for a while and give you some peace? I had one of those nights last night.   The best part is when you consciously try to remove those thoughts. I can usually concentrate on nothingness for a good thirty seconds or so before my brain gets bored and, like a small child at a grocery store, drags me by my wrist to whatever has caught its attention. Still, when you're half asleep and anxious to get the other half out of the way, it sounds like a really good idea.   It obviously didn't work, as I seem to be quite tired this morning. Should've taken that ambien...  "Homer, you're overstimulated. Let's get you home and get some beer in you and put you right to bed."

      They're really the best kind of drunken injuries, aren't they? What's the fun in injuring yourself while drunk if you can remember it? Anyway, Saturday morning I woke up and noticed this:      It took some thinking, but I now believe I know how it occured. Sabrina's going away party was Friday night at Randa's. There was 151 present (it's like kryptonite!), as well as Cazadores (mmm...). I remember having two shots of tequila and two shots of windex, and eight or so beers  seems  like a realistic estimate, but I felt far drunker than that.   So Michele was hanging out close to the toilet, and I laid down in the bathroom and was talking to her. Randa came in to check on Michele and had to step over me, and warned me to close my eyes, as she was wearing a skirt. As a display of good faith, I moved my arm to cover my eyes, apparently at the same time as she was trying to step over me. Her heel caught my arm, and that is when I think the injury was inflicted.   In retrospect, I could probably think up a much better story involving shots, stiletto heels, and bodily injury—a better, sexier story.   I didn't intend to get that drunk, but rather to properly enjoy the excellent company. Once again, I learn that high-proof liquors are not to be trifled with.   I hadn't expected Sabrina's exit to have a big impact on me, since I made my own move away from Waco a year ago, but knowing that she was leaving made me sad. Part of it is that with her exit, most of my Waco life is gone for good. Another thing is that being around my good friends, it reminds me how far I still have to go with people here in Houston. Mainly, though, Sabrina, I'll miss being able to see you whenever I spend a weekend in Waco.   Things listened to in the car on the drive home:   Modest Mouse:  Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks  The Polyphonic Spree:  Together We're Heavy  Fountains of Wayne:  Welcome Interstate Managers  Belle & Sebastian:  Dear Catastrophe Waitress

      First off, welcome, everyone, to my new weblog (or 'blog' as the kids are calling it these days). Shortly after Sabrina began her blog, she asked me why I didn't have my own.   "Because I would be playing into the stereotypes. I'm already a computer guy; I can't have a blog too."  Walking amongst the general public, it always saddens me to see people playing into stereotypes, whether they be ethnic, gender-specific, professional, social, and so forth, which is why I've pledged to fight some of the ones that apply toward me. Being an intelligent, technologically adept white male from Texas, people are going to make certain assumptions about me, and I like for them to be pleasantly surprised when it turns out they're wrong.   But, here we are. What could have brought us to this point? Well, Sabrina and co. have inspired me, and, at her request, I'm going to try this out. I expect to hear (preferably privately) if this not entertaining or interesting, because I'll either try to fix it, or, failing that, give up entirely.   Next thing you know, I'll be the fat, slovenly computer programmer with a pony tail; I'll be leave dirty dishes in my sink, throw out my candles, and refuse to talk about my feelings; I'll start following sports, become a Republican, and start listening to, oh, say, Incubus. Perhaps it should be techno. Choices, choices...  Now that I have explained myself, on to business. I'm going to take Sabrina's mission statement to heart and make my primary goal that of entertainment, though I'll probably be weak on occasion and throw in the occasional whining, soul searching, science, technology, or music post. Once again, constructive criticism is appreciated. Please don't be mean; I have surprisingly thin skin (looking at you David—already disappointed in me for doing this, proably—Win and Thomas). I'll continue to update my web page in the haphazard fashion in which I've always done it; this is to suplement it.   It needs a name. This ("Ward of the State") is a temporary one (though it could become permanent). So, I'm taking suggestions. I like the idea of doing something that's a pun on Ward, though anything else will be considered as well. I'll try to post some real content next time.

      Friday afternoon saw my temporary attempt to ignore abstracts long enough to enjoy my birthday weekend. Tiffany (also known as the girl I spilled beer on) had people over to her place to watch the opening ceremonies of the Olympics and eat pizza. Dan had promised to let me know where he, Kristin, John, and perhaps others were going to end up for the night, but Dan's a liar. Hear that, Dan? Nathan and Melissa hosted an evening of drinking games ("presidents and assholes"). I made my promised appearance and played for a few hands, long enough to work my way up from asshole. In the first round, Nathan, as president, dictated that I should take a short of vodka from a very tall shot glass. He filled it about half way, but the result was perhaps three or four shots. I took it like a champ, though.   Saturday, I spent most of the day preparing the Ward Cave (also known as "Ward's House of Love", a name which didn't fit particularly well that night) for my birthday party, doing requisite cleaning, picking up some drinks and snacks from the grocery store (Randall's had Shiner for $9.99 for a 12 pack, rock; I grabbed two), and putting together a suitable party mix with which iTunes could DJ. I went and picked up Jeff around 6:30, and waited for the party to start.   Randall's, by the way, marked the second time in twenty four hours that I was IDed, making me wonder if I did, in fact, age any. My increase in grey hairs would seem to remove any doubt, though.   Note to self: don't start a party at 7:00. I thought perhaps those that wanted some hot  urlLink Star Pizza  action would want to eat around then, but apparently not many people had planned on getting in on the hot Star Pizza action. Shortly after 8:00, Jeff and I gave up and I ordered two larges. While I was gone, people started arriving, and the pizzas got consumed fairly quickly after my return.   I had e-mailed about 25 people the invite; those who came, in order of arrival, were: Jeff, Stephanie, Jennifer, Nathan, Melissa, Brandy, David, Tiffany, John, Dan, Kristin, Char, Graham, Kennedy, Graham's sister. Not a bad turnout, although considering I invited every girl that I have a putative interest in and none of them showed, that part was a little disappointing.   The beer supply held out well, and my liquor was barely touched (except for Stephanie stealing shots of my sweet, sweet, Cazadores, yet failing to carry through on her promise to sleep with me). The evening ended with Jeff and Char giving me advice on clothing. Char told me I need to pick and image and dress accordingly. I'll get right to work on that... Nathan took some pictures at the party; however, a lot of them seem to be of feet or cleavage. If there any appropriate ones, I'll but them over on the main site. My official estimate for the evening is eight beers.   Sunday, my aunt and uncle took me to  urlLink Texas Land & Cattle  for dinner in honor of the birthday. I do love me some steak.   Monday was spent reading journal articles, feeling that I would never come up with a topic for abstract number two. After going to bed, I was struck by blinding inspiration, and now have drafts of abstracts one and two composed in my head and ready to write. I went up to school today to abuse the lab printer, and then read this afternoon and evening in support of abstract number two before Nathan, Melissa, and Jennifer kidnapped me to go read with them at the library, which, I discovered, eats at one's soul in a manner similar to the Baylor University computer science labs. I think it has something to do with white walls, fluroescent lights, and cheap furniture. I also sent off a proposal for my laptop purchase today.   Tomorrow will hopefully bring two drafts of abstracts. If things go well, I'd like to go see Magnolia Electric Co. (formerly Songs: Ohia) play their (his?—it's basically just Jason Molina) brand of country/folk. And it would be nice to catch last weekend's episode of Six Feet Under at some point.   Sorry, readers, that life is boring these days. Hopefully there will be glimpses of excitement between now and November; if not, expect a grand return to form at our departmental retreat. Or, possibly, my failing out of graduate school. Dan, I'm sorry I called you a liar. Care to keep a job open for me?

      I haven't posted since Sunday, so I thought I'd preemptively post before I was accused of slacking off. The first part of my qualifying exam is due soon, and it's not going well. Whether that's due to my underestimating its difficulty and time requirements, or whether I've missed out on some crucial part of my graduate education, I'm not sure yet. Anyway, I'm working hard to churn out something, but it's slow going.   So, there's been a lack of fun adventures lately. I'll be taking Saturday off in honor of my birthday; I decided to throw a party here, so I'll post about that, time permitting. Beyond that, hope the scientific muse smiles upon me.

      After normal Saturday activites, I headed to the 1820 Binz St. party. Viraj, whom I haven't actually met, sent out an e-mail to the graduate student mailing list about his birthday party. I certainly had nothing better to do, and reasoned that, surely, if he had invited the entire graduat school, somebody I knew would be there. So, I grabbed the emergency six pack of shine and set out in search of the party.   It took a few passes, but I narrowed things down to the correct block. I thought perhaps I was looking for a house, but didn't see anything that seemed right. I did see a lot of people parking, walking, and carrying beer, so eventually I parked and followed the people to the courtyard of an apartment complex. Picture time:      I was, frankly, amazed. There were, at the peak, a good two hundred people in the courtyard of this complex (and a DJ). What truly impressed me was that they were able to get their neighbors on board with this. There were two kegs and an inflatable pool full of beer (to which I added my contribution). I was pleased to see some of the genetics crew there, and I renewed my acquaintance with the new first years. I ended up promising two people mix CDs (one was a Dashboard Confessional fan, so I thought that an introduction to Death Cab was in order; the other just wanted a mix, and all she gave me to work with in terms of her tastes was Dave Matthews, U2, and early nineties grunge). David W. and girlfriend/SCBMBer/girl-I-spilled-beer-on-at-the-retreat Tiffany were there. Tiffany shares my fondness for tequila (though I have not yet given her the introduction to my dear friend  urlLink Cazadores ), and had apparently been indulging in that habit. We went into an apartment to get shots. There were no clean shot glasses, so David asked me how much tequila (Cuervo) i wanted.   "Three shots."  I think that impressed him thoroughly. I guess he's never seen me chug liquor before. It's good to know I can still inspire my peers. Wanda, SCBMB administrator extraordinaire put in an appearance, which continues her strong campaign for coolest program administrator ever. The cops showed up about 1:00 and made us kill the music, but did little else to hassle us. It's nice to be of age. I also met a Brittish girl in line for the bathroom, and impressed her by a) identifying her as Brittish, b) understanding her when she said her name, c) confessing that I was probably attuned to the accent from spending part of my evening watching "The Office", and d) confessing that I had to watch it with subtitles. She was a geologist who worked for Exxon (again, I'm impressed that the party invites made it as far afield as they did), and seemed pretty cool, but I lost track of her after that.   The party started slowing down around 2:30 (a bit early for my tastes), so we gathered up a crew for Taco C. David W., thanks again for all your hard work trying to propagate the Taco C. habit.   Not a whole lot happened today. Stephanie made dinner and a birthday cake in honor of mine and Jennifers's birthdays, of which I partook. Then I headed over to Dan's for Six Feet Under (great episode this week), and then over to Lisa's to see the ring, spend a little time with her and Bryan, and enjoy some of Lisa's birthday cake.   All in all, a great weekend. Hell, it's been a great week.

      Valhalla officially rocked. Three kegs, a hundred or so graduate students, thirty or so pizzas (Domino's—damn you, David W.), three hours. Record time. I showed up, got my first beer, drained it quickly, and then came back for more. The bartender's response: "That was fast." Yes, indeed. Thanks to Rice's liberal alcohol policy, the party quickly spilled out to the better-ventilated campus grounds outside of Valhalla. I quickly worked my way up to the six beer mark and then slowed things down a bit. By the time the kegs ran out at 9:00, I had probably had ten beers or so, Stephanie had bitten my neck (not sure what's going on there), I had made the rounds and hung out with some people whom I don't see frequently enough, and I had even introduced myself to some first year girls. Will & co. went to work moving the party to Woodrow's once the kegs were out, which, as always, wouldn't have been  my  first choice, but hell, I'll go where the people are.   Jeff took on the task of driving me around; we dropped by his place so he could change, and I got to try out Doom 3 for a few minutes. We made it back to Woodrow's, and amazingly, a good portion of the party had reconvened there. I'm not sure how it happened, but whoever pulled that off has my eternal respect. I had a couple more beers, heard about how there had been a golf cart joy ride back at Valhalla (golf cart theft and BCM gatherings quickly becoming like peanut butter and jelly), met a couple of the other first year girls (I really should have been in the genetics program, in retrospect), and discovered that Jeff can be a good wingman if you don't get him started on politics. Will started gathering up a crew to head to his place and partake of illicit substances, and, having just had the girl I was talking to casually work into the conversation the 'b' word (ladies: don't be paranoid that every man is trying to get into your pants, but if a guy you don't know spends a substantial portion of the evening talking to you, do try to work details such as boyfriends early on), Jeff and I made our exit.   I was thrilled to discover a substantial portion of the Miller High Life 24 pack I had bought a month ago still sitting in Will's fridge. It was shortly after that I reached the pinacle of fucked-up-ed-ness. I ended up lying on the floor, wanting desperately to communicate my desire to go home and hide in my bed, but not quite being able to. At one point, nausea swept over me, and I tried to fight it, but it just wasn't working.   Now I rarely vomit due to drinking, but when I do, it seems the results are spectacular. There was the time in New York when David and Thomas insisted on going to dinner after we had been drinking all afternoon on no lunch, and I lost it on the table. There was the time that I had just made it into my entryway at home, realized there was no way I could make it to the bathroom, and instead thought I'd make a run through the door for the yard, but failed to get the deadbolt undone.   This was different, though. In a moment of brilliant clarity, I noted the plastic shopping bag lying close to me, grabbed it, and positioned it correctly before I lost it entirely. If James Bond was fucked up and had to vomit, he couldn't have pulled off anything smoother than this. It was that good. I seriously impressed those present with my plastic bag-wielding prowess.   Pretty soon after that, I managed to convey that I should be given my keys so that I could walk the block home and go to bed. I thoughtfully placed a trashcan by my bed (which turned out to be a good idea), and slept. Next up, I'll have the Saturday report.   And now, a few pictures. First up, this is from Rebecca's return on Wednesday; dig the cool new hair:      Here's a shot she took of me and Kelly, also back on Wednesday:      Next, here's Stephanie at the Valhalla shindig:      And finally, another Valhalla shot:

      Rebecca and co. returned to the country yesterday. I'd been keeping an eye on her ETA all day, planning to time things perfectly so that I could pick them up curbside, rather than having to park, etc. At about 7:45, her flight (originally due to land at 7:20) was projected to arrive at 8:20. Allowing time for them to get through customs, my timing was going to be perfect. And then I checked her flight one last time, and it had change dto 8:02. So much for the best-laid plans of mice &c.   I fought through two sepparate traffic jams on 59 (no carpool lane for me this time), and made it to the airport at a solid 8:30, which would have been perfect—had Rebecca's flight not arrived sooner than expected. Still, as it stands, I think I deserve credit for executing my plans flawlessly, even if my plans themselves were flawed.   They were quite tired. We made a quick Taco C. run, came back, and ate. They were ready for bed, and I was ready to party.   I met Holly at the Summer Hymns show back in May. She was there solo, and I recognized her from the bus, so I introduced myself. She threw a party last night at her place, and called to invite me (as well as Stephanie and Jennifer). We had no luck getting Jennifer to go, but Stephanie came with me. I quickly helped myself to a tequila and tonic (mostly tequila; it turned out really well, which surprised me), and continued the evening with an Abita Turbo Dog, an amber beer from Colorado, and two Budweisers (perhaps more? I felt pretty drunk; I hope I'm not losing my touch). The evening's activities included a viewing of  Labrynth ; Mario Kart and Mario Party N64 style; and part of a Bond film (no, not a bondage film). Stephanie demanded to be walked home at some point, and I refused on moral grounds, so Hunter was nice enough to do so.   Anyway, all in all, it was a good evening. With the exception of the Of Montreal show and some assorted bus encounters, I hadn't gotten the chance to hang out with Holly since we met, and of course I'm always thrilled when somebody decides to throw a party. It doesn't seem to happen nearly enough around here. Perhaps I should try my hand at it one of these days (next weekend for my birthday is one option if I opt not to return to Waco), though I worry that my apartment's too small to really to it up right. That, and I fear for my liquor and beer stashes, though I suppose there are ways to deal with that.   I returned home and slept on the fold-out; I couldn't refuse the girls my bed. I didn't sleep well and am consequently a bit tired today. Rebecca, take note—I sacrificed for you. We hit up Pei Wei for an early lunch and some hot lettuce wrap action, and then I went into lab and the ladies returned to Austin.   Bryan's in town for his and Lisa's birthday, and Lisa was working, so he was kind enough to pick me up from school, and we got to share some quality time. We got some Star Pizza, and watched a couple of episodes of "The Office", thanks to a generous loan of the season 1 DVDs from Dan and Kristin.   I managed to fall into some sort of weird slump afterwards. I managed to put some dishes and clothes away, but other than that, I spent a good deal of time on the couch. An order from Amazon came in today: two Belle & Sebastian singles for the competeist in me, and a copy of Alan Moore's  Watchmen . I decided that if I was committed enough to my not-so-well-kept secret comic book hobby to stick to it through some of  X-Men 's worst days, I should also see what the heights fo the medium offer as well.   Anyway I'm sitting, reading, thinking that Sabrina has stood me up for our phone date tonight. She calls (ye of little faith), and we talk for a few minutes, and then I hear the call waiting beep. It's Bryan; I knew he was cooking dinner for Lisa tonight for their birthdays, so I was surprised to hear from him. I switched over to see what was up.   "Guess who's engaged?"  I'm caught completely off guard. For some time I've  known  that this would happen, but I didn't expect Bryan to act for another six months to a year. Of course I'm thrilled for the both of them, and almost immediately switch back to Sabrina to tell her. Of course, she wants to know who asked whom.   Back in the days of lunch in Penland Cafeteria, there was a conversation between Bryan, myself, and a few ladies present about the tradition of men asking women to marry them. Since I'm not a huge fan of gender roles (at least consciously), I fully support the idea of a woman choosing to make that definitive step, and I certainly think it shouldn't be thought of as the man's obligation. Surprisingly, the ladies disagreed; the best I could get was that a mutual agreement upon being engaged was all right, but that it was still horribly wrong for a woman to propose. I'll save the rant about gender roles and women's expectations of men for later, but the point here is that Bryan saw this as an endorsement of his lazy stratagem of waiting for Lisa to propose. Of course, Lisa was none to happy about this, and I had to backpedal a bit and explain that I was speaking of relationships in general, and my opinion was certainly not prescriptive for their relationship.   Anyway, the half-joke about Bryan waiting for Lisa to propose has continued over the year or so since its inception, and thus Sabrina's immediate curiousity. I switched back to Bryan, and it turns out they both got what they wanted. They had been having a conversation about their future, as I understand it, and Lisa had jokingly proposed with a ring constructed from a napkin. Bryan masterfully produced a real ring and proposed to Lisa, having planned to do so all along, but having no idea that fate would produce the perfect circumstances under which to do so. By the time I return to Sabrina, we're both sufficiently surprised that we've lost the ability to continue the conversation that we'd been having.   I also should point out that both Bryan and Lisa's original hookup and their engagement have involved three-way call waiting events with Sabrina.   A big  "congratulations" to Bryan and Lisa is in order. I will readily admit that I'm a bit jealous. I'd love to be that sure of my future and who I'd be spending it with, but my previous Chance at that was another instance of the flawless execution of flawed plans.   Tomorrow is a night of free pizza and free beer at Valhalla; with any luck I'll have some good antics to report on this weekend. I'm still holding out high hopes for some cuties in the incoming class, as well, and perhaps I'll find out tomorrow. For now, I'm going to put on some music and retire to the couch before I retire to the bed.

      I'll start of this post by mentioning that I've just popped open a Lone Star tall boy. Let's hear it for the national beer of Texas.   Second, Dan seemed to get a kick out of being mentioned in my last post. He proposed that he, John and I should all create weblog posts about how we are the three coolest guys in Houston. So, there you go. I've done my part.   I finally broke the news to David tonight about the Wardlog. He was a bit disappointed—I could hear it in his voice—but, as he observed, "Ward, your life is a sitcom." With that, I feel I have permission to continue.   Now, on to the titular topic. I recently received a fellowship. Nationally competitive fellowships result in us being given a $2000/year raise. Sadly, this is not a nationally competitive fellowship, so the principle benefit is to my lab and my professor, who save around thirty grand a year by not paying my salary, tuition, and benefits. However, the fellowship does include a nice chunk of change to be put towards "lab equipment" and it is this money that many like myself use to derive personal benefit from the fellowship.   I heard tell of one man who used his money to buy a '30" display', which is actually a plasma TV in his living room. This has the possible ring of an urban legend, but it captures the spirit of things. It seems to be pretty common to buy computer upgrades, and then install them in one's home computer.   It's with this in mind that I approached one of the fellowship administrators about the possibility of putting the money towards a laptop. I was informed that in order to follow the letter of the law, the laptop would techincally belong to my lab, but there's generally no problem with retaining posession of the computer when the student leaves.   With that information, I know am seriously thinking about retiring the quickly-aging orange iMac (or Charlene, as she is seldom called) to a second career of web serving, file serving, and music playing, and moving more intensive work to a new PowerBook. I'm currently trying to decide between the convenient smallness of the 12" model and the extra screen real estate of the 15" model. I'm currently leaning towards the latter; not only does it have a sexy wide screen, but there is also this beautiful phrase: "ambient-light sensitive fiber-optically lit keyboard". That's right, folks, turn out the light and the letters and numbers light up. Totally hot. But stepping up the 15" model is a slippery slope; for a little more, I can step further up to a faster processor, and then it's just a little more to the better graphics card, the faster hard drive, the better memory. And then there's the necessity of the after-market memory upgrade to get things up to a nice, workable gigabyte of RAM...  Not only that, but Apple's currently running a promotion whereby purchasers of a Powerbook and an iPod can get a $200 rebate. So for a mere $70 net, I can upgrade to a new iPod that's twice the size of my old one. Market forces on eBay dictate that my current model has a resell value of upwards of $200, so I could upgrade and turn a bit of a profit, even.   Folks, it's an exciting time to be alive.

      I always thought I had a fairly large music collection. It's around 250 or so; my iTunes library (which includes some things I don't have on CD) works out to about 17 days of continuous music. Assuming a cost of $13 per CD, that works out to a total expenditure of $3250. Here's a visual:      However, watching "Six Feet Under" at Dan's on Sunday night, I was once again awestruck with the majesty of his collection, whose size he approximated at "about 4000" (correction: Dan says 3000, which is still impressive). Now to be entirely fair, a significant portion of those are live shows that he's recorded and traded for, but that would still leave a thousand or so. It's most impressive when witnessed in person, but this should give you an idea:      Also on Sunday, I stopped by Sam's to pick up a new floor fan. I have problems with air distribution in my apartment; though there is one vent for every room, they are all fairly centrall located, and my living room has the largest space but only one vent. Additionally, the living room contains all of the heat producing electronics, and the worst offender, the iMac, happens to be located at one of the most distant points form the air vent. I have a celing fan, but it can only do so much. So, I got something similar to this (but with a short stand):      These things are amazing. Putting it near the cool part of my apartment and aiming it towards the hot, it manages to, on low power, keep my living room evenly cooled. I've even been able to bump the thermostat up a few degrees. Honestly, I think a small array of these could create a tornado or hurricane of horrible destructive force. You should all write your congresspersons to alert them of the potential danger to America's security. Or, better yet, armed with this knowledge, a select group of us could rule the world, James Bond villain-style. Think about it.

      Fridays at West Alabama Icehouse have been going downhill lately. Last week, I showed up and Graham was there, alone. This week, it was Graham and Kennedy (sans the girl she wanted to set me up with). We hung out a bit, drinking beer and eating the free hot dogs, before they retired for the evening to watch a movie, and I went off in search of something else to do. I don't know what's behind this fall-off in attendance; perhaps Graham's e-mails reminding us to come out are no longer as effective as they used to be; perhaps the change in time (moved later due to the heat of the summer) has thrown people off; perhaps it's just become boring; or perhaps people are just busy. Who knows? Certainly not I.   I called up Jeff, post-doc extradonaire, and we decided to go see a movie. Shymalan's  The Village  narrowly won out over  The Manchurian Candidate , and not-so-narrowly won out over  Napolean Dynamite  and  Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle  (which, shamed though I am to admit it, I want to see—it would be perfect Drunk At The Dollar Theater fodder, were Sabrina only here).   I liked it. It was well filmed, written, and acted, and I thought that Shymalan's signature twist ending was clever, though Jeff found it distracting, and many others in the theater loudly complained that it was lame or cheesy. I'd recommend it highly had I not heard so many dissenting opinions; so, your milage may vary.   Saturday was reserved for traditional Saturday afternoon activies; I went to Susan and Jerry's and did laundry, and we went to dinner at the Black-eyed Pea, which, though not a personal favorite of mine, was free and therefore beyond reproach.   When I first got interested in computers, I got a subscription to   urlLink MacWorld  , which, thanks to my genetic predisposition to read things cover-to-cover, was in large part responsible for greatly expanding my knowledge of computers. Since home audio is becoming a big hobby of mine, I went ahead and purchased a subscription to   urlLink Stereophile  . It was only about a dollar an issue, but I have a feeling it's going to wind up having a bigger budgetary impact in the long run. Still, most of the products they deal with are not only outside of my pricerange, but  way  outside of my pricerange, so hopefully it won't incite me to do anything rash. I also picked up a copy of   urlLink The Absolute Sound   to see if the grass is greener on the other side of glossy-print fence. All of that is to say that I started working my way through my first issue of  Stereophile  while I was doing laundry.   Road construction is a perpetual fact of life in Houston, and loop 610 was down to one lane for a couple of miles on my return trip, near I-10. This was clearly signed ("left 2 lanes closed ahead"), and so I took the opportunity to go ahead and move into the lane that I knew would remain open. Of course, there are those who think that they're better than everybody else and instead drive ahead in the soon-to-be-closed lanes, knowing that somebody will let them over at the last possible second when they have to merge. These people are absolute failures as as human beings and will be the downfall of society as we know it. In return for a minimal gain for themselves (moving ten or twenty cars forward in line) which saves them an insignificant amount of time, they are responsible for further exacerbating the situation for those of us who actually know how to drive. As far as I'm concerned, they can all go to hell. I ended up in a battle of wills with one particular car trying to merge in front of me. I lost, because though I'm willful, I'm not entirely stupid. I think a little part of me died.   Jeff and I met Dan and Kristin at  urlLink Mary Jane's  (ignore their gradual transition to the name "Fat Cat", it will always be Mary Jane's in the harts and minds of the hipsters of Houston) to see  urlLink The Damnwells :    and  urlLink Jesse Malin :     The former produced enjoyable if somewhat generic alt-country/power pop. Their lead singer criticized  urlLink this article  in the  Houston Press  which referred to Jesse Malin as a "solipsistic fuckface" and said that we, as a city, should be ashamed. What I was not prepared for was learning that the  Press 's reviewer was, in fact, more or less right. Malin played sub-par Ryan Adams-ish frat rock between telling stories about exposing himself to girls when he was in junior high. We left early and made the rounds at  urlLink the Harp , Whataburger, and Woodrow's.
