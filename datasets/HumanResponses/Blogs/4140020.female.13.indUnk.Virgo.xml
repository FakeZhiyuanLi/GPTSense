      I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. It's so incredible. I talked to him and told him how i felt about him being my best friend and added the fact that he became a sort of brother to me that i could talk to about anything and holding hands with him just didn't feel right. So he said, that it's fine, and he still likes me for who i am anyway, so that sort of relieved me, knowing that. But i feel really bad cuz his first girlfriend only lasted him 2 days, no wait, 46 hrs, 33 min. lol...he counted.   I think i'm realizing why i get those feelings i was talking about when i have a boyfriend from school. I always get worried what my friends from youth group will say. those people are a big part of my life and i'm just scared that they won't approve or will judge whoever it is. And i realize that that is kind of crazy cuz i'm sure they would accept anyone...after all we do have an interesting variety of kids. But also it happens when i really like someone in the youth group and i worry what he thinks of me...

      I feel so bad. I'm going out with this kid and we're like BEST friends but I don't think i can continue "going out" with him cuz it's just to wierd. i don't like him any more than a friend and i've now realized that. And I hate breaking up with people, i'm not the kind of person that just dumps people after a day. But when I'm going out with someone and I don't want to be, I get this feeling and I'm just so upset with myself and I feel alone because I can't tell anyone without it starting a rumor. I just wished that I wouldn't have to change my mind about everything. I don't wante to hurt his feelings, but already it's hurting mine.

      So school's been going pretty good, I like my teachers, yes, even my one uber wierd teacher. And i'll tell you why...last year science would bore me because mrs.mcconihay just wasn't very interesting. She too was wierd but it just wasn't enough to keep me interested. Mr. Doughty, however yells every once in a while to keep your attention, and sounds funny when he talks and also has some pretty wierd comments/jokes. So in other words his way of teaching keeps me interested and that's good.   I also like Mrs. Schlick very much because no.1 She likes the blue man group, no.2 she doesn't like to give much homework, no.3 she's very nice, no.4 her class has been fun so far.  My least favorite class has been geometry because we had to do a 10th grade practice FCAT today and yesterday (eveon though we are 8th graders) and we asked her how we are suppose to know what is coming on the 8th grade FCAT since we are doing 10th grade stuff and so how are we suppose to do good on it if we haven't done it in a long time? And she sort of just gave us a blank stare and said, "Umm...that's a good question..." Yeah, so i'm not planning on doing good on the FCAT this year.  Also Mr. Doughty today showed us the emergency shower for if we get chemicals on us and it's so wierd cuz it's just this shower in the classroom with no curtain or anything. It's just something i've never seen before. He turned it on to show us how it worked. All the water came out so quickly and there was just so much of it cuz the shower head is so big and my friend who was sitting right next to it almost got splashed. But i guess it is good to have a shower just in case you spill something like acid on you, yeah, that would be a good thing to wash it off.
