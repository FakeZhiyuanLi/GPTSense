       i was just reading about this guy. this guy i know. went to australia and yea.. turned gay. den he stated in his web that about how his parents were disappointed n stuff..poor guys, and all about his ex-s. man. i just don feel right about all these homosexualism. haha. even this cheryl i know..she's like.. went on abt homosexualism den i was like 'are u les'. she said 'wad do u think'. weird. i didn want to think. haha. that day at crescents' we saw these two girls holding hands, laughing at each other too. haha, not u rachel. but i dont promote it. yeah. on a lighter note, here is a nice song by 411, about a quarreling couple:    I can't fall down on my knees And apologise to you Cos that ain't my style  I remember how we met, It was on the train How could I forget? You smiled and you looked at me The soft of your lips, it captured me The whole ride down we kept our eyes on each other And then we sat down together You gave me your number, Said Give me a call I thought I wouldn't call at all Here we are, fell in love Like hand to glove Pure bliss from above Now all we seem to do is fuss and fight We never seem to get it right  I can't fall down on my knees And apologise to you Cos that ain't my style (x2)  I remember the night when we were home alone You were on the sofa, I was on the phone You overheard me call out my best friend's name That's when you went crazy, started going insane Grabbed the phone from my hand, Backed me against the wall Shouting and asking Who was on the call? You wouldn't believe me When I said it's just a friend That's when all the matters began  I can't fall down on my knees And apologise to you Cos that ain't my style (x2)  He's got you begging on your knees, Crying in your sleep Making you believe him But you're stronger Than you'll ever know, girl You control your own world No need to take no more  And yo' I asked you to calm down Asked you who was on the phone put the horn down You had a glass of wine a Versace night gown, a lime green one That I brought you for the trip from the    cruise    you won, I don't approve of those male friends, (no) I told you back then when we first got together, I don't trust those men And you did it again I lost my temper, blinked out and wrecked the house boo That's all I remember, I'm sorry  He's got you begging on your knees, Crying in your sleep Making you believe him But you're stronger Than you'll ever know, girl You control your own world No need to take no more

"piu cheese, piu cheese". wah shiok. den we trained hard the next few days and competed. well, we sucked as the youngest band, so we went off empty-handed, but it was a cool experience, especially that pro oboe solo frm this italian woman. damn nice. mark n lijai were like trying to take photos of some italian girls. haha. not bad. cute. and cagliari is a uber nice place. didn get to see zola though. me, jerel, mx, mark, n some others walked around the shops. cool but expensive. so we settled for 'valburger' and breads. and i somehow dropped a tall ice-cream cone at val. wth. wasted. yeah, but it was damn fun walking around n saying hello to the locals. esp this two girls with their bfs. hahaha. remember mark? the guys looked pissed off. then mx got us to buy bitter chocolates. 'thanks'. we went back to the ferry to return to rome again. mark and ljai were at it again, taking photos of a girl. then i took photos of sunrise at the top of the ferry. damn cool but it was freezing at the top. played plenty of hearts, taitees, bridge. then took a flight to transit at bangkok and back to spore. we had great tomyam soup at bangkok which ian introduced. farn man. haha. great experience yeah. so many things to look back at. like me and mark having soft spots on the opposite sex wearing white windbreakers. eating a coffee ice cream in the cold. the coach rides. taking photos. the sick green disgusting helluva pool at setar. amazing buffet breakfast. playing as one at the concert. foo's hair full of dandruff. lester's sick jokes on board. italy rawwked. thanks jerel for being a great room-mate and friend. mingxuan for revealing the other side of u. haha. mark for ur never-ending humour n telling me ur life stories, remember rome airport? and everyone else in the trip. great great trip. but not worth the three thousand bucks. haha. just love these kind of trips. especially with friends around.

      today was interesting. reached sch at 6.15 for the national day celebrations. had to wait so damn long until i cld march in with the flagbearers. irritating. anw i stood at the the corner to hear milton play a gd fanfare for the anthem b4 joining the band. den went to receive a kinda useless cert, and tan see keng screwed us up. haha. after that was the comm meeting and den we cleared up the comm rm. not too bad considered we needed three big rubbish bags n a container just for unwanted stuff found in a rm as big as one and a half times of a toilet. den after that went to kap with mil, mark, bryan, yo-slim for lunch. den set off to milton's house for class bbq. haha. i didn know i missed tennis so much. it was fun being able to hit low hard shots but still didn get to play a match with marcus.. anyway the bbq was fun. lijin was gd at cooking man. like milton's mom quoted, "a great husband to have" or something like dat. haha. about 20 were there. den we went off at 11 plus. thanks milton..even tho we gave u much trouble..haha. ... woke up today weary, tired, sleepy with sore legs. went for piano lesson at 1015 den tuition at 1130 straight after. i need a break.

       thx ruggers. an added full-day  holiday  on wednesday and maybe a full no-lesson day on thurs due to the charity bazaar makes school Fun. these few days went past pretty fast. nothing much actually. taking over the band, much planning, boring mep lessons and sleeping throughout a maths doubles were the nice ones. at least the first of 2 a maths lessons was 'marred' by a fire drill. running was fun too, cuz i pushed to 8.20 for 2k by following chris n jingwei. well, i tried to. haha. den today went back to dls to meet up with the guys. didn do much, thnx mr.ang for the pizzas n pasta. that's all i guess.
