       Once upon a time,There lived a king. The King had abeautiful daughter, the Princess. But the kingdom was a sad place.There was no laughter, and no joy.The problem was, that everything the Princess touched would melt.No matter what, metal, wood, plastic .. .. anything she touched would melt!! Because of this, men were afraid of her.Nobody would dare marry her.The king despaired.What could he do to help his beautiful daughter?He consulted his wizards and magicians. One wizard told the king, "If yourdaughter touches one thing thatdoes not melt in her hands, shewill be cured." The King was overjoyed. The nextday, he held a competition. Any manwho could bring his daughter anobject that would not melt at hertouch, would marry her and inheritthe King's wealth. Three young princes took up the challenge. The first Prince brought a very hardalloy of titanium.When the Princess touched it, itmelted. The Prince went away sadly. The second Prince brought a hugediamond, thinking that diamond isthe hardest substance in the worldand will not melt. But, alas, once the Princess touchedit, it melted. He too went away disappointed. The third Prince approached. He told the Princess, "Put your handin my pocket and feel what is in there."The Princess did as she was told,though she turned red. She felt something hard. She heldit in her hand .. .. and it did not melt!! The King was overjoyed!!Everybody in the kingdom wasoverjoyed!! And the third Prince married thePrincess and the both lived happily ever after.  The question is?!?!  What WAS the object in the Prince's pocket?!?!   They were M&amp;M's, of course.THEY melt in your MOUTH,NOT in your HAND!!

       TRUE STORY....  AFTER A FEW OF THE USUAL SUNDAY EVENING HYMNS, THE CHURCH'S PASTOR SLOWLY STOOD UP, WALKED OVER TO THE PULPIT AND, BEFORE HE GAVE HIS SERMON FOR THE EVENING, BRIEFLY INTRODUCED A GUEST MINISTER WHO WAS IN THE SERVICE THAT EVENING.  IN THE INTRODUCTION, THE PASTOR TOLD THE CONGREGATION THAT THE GUEST MINISTER WAS ONE OF HIS DEAREST CHILDHOOD FRIENDS AND THAT HE WANTED HIM TO HAVE A FEW MOMENTS TO GREET THE CHURCH AND SHARE WHATEVER HE FELT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE SERVICE. WITH THAT, AN ELDERLY MAN STEPPED UP TO THE PULPIT AND BEGAN TO SPEAK.  "A FATHER, HIS SON, AND A FRIEND OF HIS SON WERE SAILING> OFF THE PACIFIC COAST," HE BEGAN, "WHEN A FAST APPROACHING STORM BLOCKED ANY ATTEMPT TO GET BACK TO THE SHORE. THE WAVES WERE SO HIGH, THAT EVEN THOUGH THE FATHER WAS AN EXPERIENCED SAILOR, HE COULD NOT KEEP THE BOAT UPRIGHT AND THE THREE WERE SWEPT INTO THE OCEAN AS THE BOAT CAPSIZED."  THE OLD MAN HESITATED FOR A MOMENT, MAKING EYE CONTACT WITH TWO TEENAGERS WHO WERE, FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE SERVICE BEGAN, LOOKING SOMEWHAT INTERESTED IN HIS STORY.  THE AGED MINISTER CONTINUED WITH HIS STORY, "GRABBING A RESCUE LINE, THE FATHER HAD TO MAKE THE MOST EXCRUCIATING DECISION OF HIS LIFE: TO WHICH BOY HE WOULD THROW THE OTHER END OF THE LIFE LINE. HE ONLY HAD SECONDS TO MAKE THE DECISION. THE FATHER KNEW THAT HIS SON WAS A CHRISTIAN AND HE ALSO KNEW THAT HIS SON'S FRIEND WAS NOT.  THE AGONY OF HIS DECISION COULD NOT BE MATCHED BY THE TORRENT OF WAVES. "AS THE FATHER YELLED OUT, 'I LOVE YOU, SON!' HE THREW OUT THE LIFE LINE TO HIS SON'S FRIEND.  BY THE TIME THE FATHER HAD PULLED THE FRIEND BACK TO THE CAPSIZED BOAT, HIS SON HAD DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE RAGING SWELLS INTO THE BLACK OF NIGHT. HIS BODY WAS NEVER RECOVERED."  BY THIS TIME, THE TWO TEENAGERS WERE SITTING UP STRAIGHT IN THE PEW, ANXIOUSLY WAITING FOR THE NEXT WORDS TO COME OUT OF THE OLD MINISTER'S MOUTH.  "THE FATHER," HE CONTINUED, "KNEW HIS SON WOULD STEP INTO ETERNITY WITH JESUS AND HE COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF HIS SON'S FRIEND STEPPING INTO AN ETERNITY WITHOUT JESUS. THEREFORE, HE SACRIFICED HIS SON TO SAVE THE SON'S FRIEND.  HOW GREAT IS THE LOVE OF GOD THAT HE SHOULD DO THE SAME FOR US.  OUR HEAVENLY FATHER SACRIFICED HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON THAT WE COULD BE SAVED.  I URGE YOU TO ACCEPT HIS OFFER TO RESCUE YOU AND TAKE A HOLD OF THE LIFE LINE HE IS THROWING OUT TO YOU IN THIS SERVICE."  WITH THAT, THE OLD MAN TURNED AND SAT BACK DOWN IN HIS CHAIR> AS SILENCE FILLED THE ROOM.  THE PASTOR AGAIN WALKED SLOWLY TO THE PULPIT AND DELIVERED A BRIEF SERMON WITH AN INVITATION AT THE END. HOWEVER, NO ONE RESPONDED TO THE APPEAL. WITHIN MINUTES AFTER THE SERVICE ENDED, THE TWO TEENAGERS WERE AT THE OLD MAN'S SIDE.  "THAT WAS A NICE STORY," POLITELY STATED ONE OF THE BOYS, "BUT I DON'T THINK IT WAS VERY REALISTIC FOR A FATHER TO GIVE UP HIS ONLY SON'S LIFE IN HOPES THAT THE OTHER BOY WOULD BECOME A CHRISTIAN."  "WELL, YOU'VE GOT A POINT THERE," THE OLD MAN REPLIED, GLANCING DOWN AT HIS WORN BIBLE. A BIG SMILE BROADENED HIS NARROW FACE, HE ONCE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE BOYS AND SAID, "IT SURE ISN'T VERY REALISTIC, IS IT? BUT I'M STANDING HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU THAT STORY GIVES ME A GLIMPSE OF WHAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR GOD TO GIVE UP HIS SON FOR ME.  YOU SEE --- I WAS THAT FATHER AND YOUR PASTOR IS MY SON'S FRIEND."

       Dati mo na syang kakilala. Lumalabas kayo pero hindi date yun ha. Wala lang. kain lang sa labas, kwentuhan lang. Walang katapusang kakatext. Namumulubi ka na nga kasi magka-iba ang provider nyo. Naiirita ka kung ang tagal ng reply nya, kaya kahit alam mong wala ka pang pambili ng load tatawagan mo sya. Napipikon ka na sa provider mo kaya para masaya,nagpa-sim swap ka. Pag malungkot ka, bad trip, naiirita kahit pa ata bente pesos na lang yung natitirang load mo, tatawagan mo sya. Wala lang. Basta ang alam mo lang you want that person to be there with you. Emote! Naguguluhan ka. Hindi kasi sya katropa. Conflicting ang interest nya tsaka ng mga friends mo. Pero kapag niyaya ka nya kahit na sino pang magtampo sasama ka. Then, katampuhan kayo. Hindi mo na sya kinausap at pinanindigan naman ng loko. Hurt ka syempre. INIYAKAN MO, ITINULOG, IKINAIN.Pero NANGITIAN KA LANG OK NA. Ngayon magkasama na kayo ulit. As if naman may choice ka. Kahit ayaw mo kunyari wala ka namang magagawa. Tamang-tama broken-hearted ka. Litong-lito. Since ok na kayo,lumalabas ulit kayo. Gaya ng dati, wala lang kain lang ulit sa labas,kwentuhan. Ngayon mas kilala nyo na ang isa't-isa. Alam na nya halos lahat ng tungkol sa'yo. Alam nyo kung bad trip ang isat-isa. Alam nyo kung nalulungkot o nag-eemote yung isa. You still have your misunderstanding tsaka tampuhan pero this time after the tampuhan, syemps babawi na kayo sa isat-isa. Sweet nyo noh? Grabe na ito! Takbuhan mo na sya ngayon kung may problema ka. Naikwento mo na lahat ng sama ng loob mo, mga bagay na hindi mo masabi dun sa lalaking iniyakan mo. Unang-una dahil iba ang kasama nya at hindi mo sya makausap ng matino.Bukod pa dun sa parati na lang kayong nag-aaway nung iniyakan mo pag nag-uusap kayo. Pero this one,comfortable ang feeling nyo with each other. Sweet kayo kahit para syo hindi. You actually have your breakfast together at hindi lang yun, you share the same cup of coffee pa. Pinagtitimpla mo sya ng coffee at ginagawa mo para sa kanya yung hindi mo magawa para dun sa iniiyakan mong may kasamang iba. RING!!!! Oops phone call para sa kanya. siginificant other nya. Bakit ka namumula? Magpaapekto ba. Selos ka noh? BAKIT. KAYO BA??? Hindi naman diba! Concentrate. Deep breathing..... Inhale.... Exhale..... Kaya mo yan. Focus.Try to look back. Ano ang nakikita mo? Sino ang iniisip mo? SIYA. Hindi ba dapat yung iniiyakan mo nung nakaraang buwan lang? Syet! You are starting to realize how cool this person is. Syeter! You are beginning to doubt you're feelings dun sa sinabihan mong mahal mo. Syetest! Pero knowing you, idedeny mo na you are actually starting to feel something for this person. What 'dja gonna do? But of course, alamin mo kung friends lang ba kayo.How the hell are you going to find out? Aha! Go to the person and ask it right to their face. "Gusto mo ba ako?" Grabe, as if puwede.Do you have the guts to do it? Do it. I'm right behind you, theoretically speaking. Eniwey, you still have the option of whether you would like to know or not. Think. Think hard. Super malambing siya sa iyo pero... Alam mo naman na ganun din sya sa iba. Eh wala naman palang problema eh! Eh bat ka pa apektado???? Sabagay hindi kita masisi kung bakit. Lalo na nung he starts humming love songs (pamilyar di ba? parang yung kakilala mo.), starts asking you funny questions. Like... "What would you do if a guy na hindi mo masyado kilala asks you out for a date?"Ikaw pa ang tinanong. Eh di ba sumama ka nga sa kanya. Remember...nag-aalangan ka pa nga nun kze hindi mo pa sya ganun kakilala. Kung sino-sino na nga binulabog mo para pagtanungan kung papayag ka. Now he starts asking you about certain situations. "Pano kung niyaya kang manood ng sine at hinawakan ang kamay mo. Ano daw ang reaksyon mo?" Sabay patong ng kamay nya sa kamay mo. Dramatization kung baga. Nanlalamig ka at kinakabahan, hindi dahil sa tanong syempre noh.Yun na yun.Sinagot mo syempre. Sabi mo tatanungin mo kung para san yun syempre. "Eh pano kung hinawakan na talaga?" Sabay hawak sa kamay mo, holding hands na this time. Syempre nanlalamig ka na at ninenerbyos. Sabi mo, "ok lang magkaibigan naman ata sila eh". "Eh pano kung I-kiss ka?" Sabi mo, "What for?" Thank you daw for the wonderful evening..ek ek.Sabi mo "Ah ok....basta sa pisngi lang ha. Kasi pag sa lips na masyado nang intimate yun. di ba?" Eh pano daw kung hindi nagpaalam tapos kiniss ka sa lips? Stolen kiss daw. "Aba loko noh?! As if naman merong magtatangka".Then he answers you "Ako, I would!" SOOOOOOWWWWWSSSSSSS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tapos nanood na nga kayo ng sine.Medyo biyolente yung eksena. Takot ka syempre. tinatakpan mo yung mata mo ng kamay mo. Inaalis naman nya. Kinakagat mo yung mga kuko mo. Inaalis pa rin nya yung kamay mo. Kinuha nya tapos pinatong nya yung braso nya para hindi mo na makuha. Ayaw mong paawat kaya yung kanan naman. Sumuko, binitiwan yung kaliwang kamay mo.Kinagat mo ulit yung kuko mo sa daliri mo kze natatakot ka. Kinuha nya ulit yung kamay mo. Hindi rin makulit no? Agaw trip ba? Akala mo hahawakan lang. Aba ang loko, nakikagat sa kuko mo. Ano ba yan????? NO MALICE???? NO MALICE.... Ang gulo noh???? Tutuksuhin ka dun sa lalaking sinabi mong mahal mo. Titingnan yung reaksyon mo.Pag ikaw naman ang kusang nagkwento, iirapan ka tapos tatalikuran na. PAMBIHIRA. Men..... Hayaan daw syang tumulong para makalimutan mo na yung lalaking iniiyakan mo. Feel mo nagbibiro lang..... hmmmm nagbibiro nga lang ba? Ayaw mong bigyan ng malisya lahat ng nagyayari sa inyo kasi magkaibigan kayo tsaka alam naman nya na inlove ka. Pa rin? Eh bat ka nalilito ngayon kung mahal mo nga yung sinabihan mong mahal mo. Mahal mo pa nga ba??? Eh ba't hindi mo na masagot yan ngayon? Ano akala ko ko ba dati mas pipiliin mo yung lalaking mahal mo. Eh bat nag-iba ata ang ihip ng hangin. Mas gusto mo na ngayon yung mahal ka. Hindi lang sa salita kundi sa gawa. WALA LANG TALAGA YANG LAGAY NA YAN HA??? AAWW SHUT UP!

       Please don't drink and drive, someone cares about you!! ........the true meaning of christmas and all year around...  This has gone around before, but it is well worth sharingagain. Please read,, this hits very close to home On the last day before Christmas, I hurried to go to thesupermarket to buy the remaining of the gifts I didn'tmanage to buy earlier. When I saw all the people there, I started to complain to myself,It is going to take forever here and I still have so many otherPlaces to go.  Christmas really is getting more and more annoying everyyear.How I wish I could just lie down, go to sleep and only wake upafter ...Nonetheless, I made my way to the toy section, and thereI started to curse the prices, wondering if after all kids really playwith such expensive toys.While looking in the toy section, I noticed a small boy of about 5 yearsOld, pressing a doll against his chest. He kept on touching the hairof the doll and looked so sad. I wondered who this doll was for. Then thelittle boy turned to the old woman next to him:"Granny, are you sure I donthave enough money?"The old lady replied: "You know that you dont have enough money to buythis doll, my dear."Then she asked him to stay there for 5 minutes whileshe went to look around. She left quickly. The little boy was still holding the doll in is hand.Finally, I started to walk towards him and I asked him who he wanted togive this doll to."It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted somuch for this Christmas. She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it toher."I replied to him that maybe Santa Claus will bring it to her afterall, andnot to worry. But he replied to me sadly. "No, Santa Claus cannot bring itto her where she is now. Ihave to give the doll to my mother so that she can give it to her when shegoes there."His eyes were so sad while saying this. "My sister has gone to be with God.Daddy says that Mummy will also go to see God very soon, so I thought thatshe could take the doll with her to give it to my sister".My heart nearly stopped. The little boy looked up at me andsaid: "I told daddy to tell mummy not to go yet. I asked him to wait untilI came back from the supermarket". Then he showed me a very nice photoof him where he was laughing. He then told me: "I also want mummy to takethis photo with her so that she will not forget me. I love my mummy and Iwish she doesn't have to leave me but daddy says that she has to go to bewith my little sister". Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes,very quietly. I quickly reached for my wallet and took a few bills and saidto the boy.  "What if we checked again, just in case if you have enough money?" "Ok" he said. "I hope that I have enough".I added some of my money to his without him seeing and we started to countit. There was enough for the doll, and even some left over.The little boy said: "Thank you God for giving me enough money".Then helooked at me andadded:"I asked yesterday before I went to sleep for God to make sure I haveenough money to buy this doll so that mummy can give it to my sister. Heheard me. I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for mymummy, but didn't dare to ask God too much. But he gave me enough to buythe doll and the white rose." "You know, my mummy loves white roses". A fewminutes later, the old lady came back again and I left with my cart.I finished my shopping in a totally different state from when I started. Icouldnt get the little boy out of my mind. Then I remembered a localnewspaper article 2 days ago, which mentioned of a drunk man in a truck whohit a car where there was one young lady and a little girl. The little girldied right away, and the mother was left in a critical state. The familyhad to decide whether to pull the plug on the life-assistingmachine, because the young lady would not be able to get out of the coma.Was this thefamily of the little boy?Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the newspaperthat the young lady had passed away. I couldn't stop myself and went to buya bunch of white roses and I went to the mortuary where the body of theyoung woman was exposed for people to see and make last wish before burial.She was there, in her coffin, holding abeautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and thedoll placedover her chest. I left the place crying, feeling that my life had beenchanged forever. The love that this little boy had for his mother and hissister is still, to this day, hard to imagine. And in a fraction of asecond,a drunk man had taken all this awayfrom him.  ...  FRIENDS ARE LIKE ANGELS, WHO HELP US FLY WHENOUR WINGS HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO FLY.

       JUST FRIENDS ? By Susan Nikaido  If my sources are correct, the following scenario isplayed out frequently among the world of Christiansingles. It happens on both sides of the gender line,but allow me to talk about it from my own femaleperspective.A man meets a woman and begins to show interest inher. He asks her to spend time with him on a regularbasis : hiking, biking, watching videos. He calls herat least once a week just to talk. He begins tellingher about the deeper things in his heart and invitesher to share at this level as well.He sends her mushy "friendship" cards and tells herthat she means a great deal to him. He may become alittle affectionate : the hugs begin to linger.The relationship has been defined as friendship, if ithas been defined at all. But after all this specialattention, the woman is definitely feeling more. Soshe asks the guy what's going on.To her surprise, he does a quick about-face. Heinsists they are just friends. After that, he avoidsher, leaving her hurt and bewildered. She feelsrejected - she has lost not only a romantic interest(she thought) but worse, a close and trusted friend.And she feels stupid. Did she really misread all thosesignals?After I experienced this as a single woman, I asked afriend my friend "Joe" to help me understand why guysdo this. After I told him my woeful tale, he said, "Idid that to somebody once.""What? Why would you ever do such a thing?" I asked."We were getting too close, and it scared me," hesaid.This helped me understand why the "just friends"syndrome is so widespread. A guy wants to get to knowa girl, but without the pressure of dating. So hespends a lot of time with her, treating her in manyways like a girlfriend but defining the relationshipas friends. This way, if it begins to look likethere's no future in the relationship, or he's notready to "get serious," he can back away with no messybreakup. It sounds like a nice arrangement - for theguy.But that approach can be a problem for the woman. If aman tells a woman he just wants to "be friends" but hetreats her like it's more than friendship, she willbelieve his behavior instead of his words. It sets herup for a big disappointment. Or if he invokes the"just friends" mantra after being asked about thenature of the relationship, but then promptly beginsto distance himself from the friendship, again, hisactions do not match his words.He may think he's sparing her feelings by avoiding abreakup. But by defining the relationship as afriendship, he hurts her even more deeply when hedisappears. A dating relationship comes with certainrisks. But she expects a friendship - especially sucha close one - to continue. Think about it this way : Abroken dating relationship says only, "I don't want tomarry you"; a broken friendship says to her, "I don'twant/value you on any level."Taking a woman down this path violates two scripturalprinciples. First, it's dishonest. The apostle Paulsaid that it was the way of the world - not of a godlyman - to say "yes, yes" and "no, no" in the samebreath (2 Cor. 1:17).A man of integrity will call a relationship what itis. Second, it is not kind or loving. The "justfriends" approach may be safer for the guy, but it isharmful to the woman. In effect, he is asking her forthe rewards of a dating relationship - companionship,emotional intimacy, even affection - without theresponsibility. He is playing with her heart, and herheart will probably get broken.But what if a guy does only want to be friends - orwants to develop a friendship before he decides todate?It's pretty simple. He just treats the woman like allhis other friends. He doesn't spend more time with heror call her more often than he does his other friends.He usually invites other people along when he getstogether with her. He doesn't pick up the tab whenjust the two of them go out. He avoids complimentsthat might communicate she is "special" to him. Helets her know he spends time with other women. He'sextremely careful about showing any physical affection* even playful shoves or hugs.If, after getting to know her from a safe emotionaldistance, he wants a deeper relationship, he tells herthat he wants to date her.What if you are not thinking about more thanfriendship, but she asks about your intentions? Tellher you appreciate her friendship, but be honest aboutwhere you are. Above all, though it may be awkward fora while, continue to be her friend.Years ago, I began to be attracted to a male friend.Though I hadn't really been getting any signals thathe was interested in me, I knew it would help settlemy emotions to hear it from him. I asked. He affirmedme as a person but told me gently - but clearly - thathe thought of me only as a friend. And then he did awonderful thing. He kept being my friend. Though ithurt a little to learn I wasn't attractive to him inthat way, it helped to know he still valued me andwanted me around. This was nearly 15 years ago, andthough we have both moved to different states andmarried, we are friends to this day.Women can be great friends. But guys, unless you areready for a dating relationship, please be careful totreat us "as sisters, with absolute purity" (1 Tim.5:2), not as girlfriends, nor as something in between.Your honesty - with yourself and with us- will bepleasing to the LORD, and prevent hurtful confusionfor your sisters in Christ.In the ocean of life. God is our buoyant force.No matter how strong the wind and how giagantic the waves are, we shall not sink as long as we are anchored on HIM.

       NOONG IN-LOVE KA PA Ang sarap ng in-love.  Sa unang beses niyo mag-date tapos naramdaman niyo ang sinasabi nilang "spark" nako, magkaharap pa kayo naiisip mo na ang bukas Para matawagan mo na siya at maayang makipag-date ulit, pero sa susunod kayong dalawa na lang.  Hindi ka mapakali pag wala siya sa tabi mo o hindi mo siya nakakausap sa isang araw, sigurado at sigurado tatawagan mo siya sa opisina, sa bahay at pag wala doon maglo-load ka sa cellphone mo at uubusuin ang 300 na prepaid sa loob ng isang tawag na wala naman ibang laman kundi bungisngis, kamustahan at kuento tungkol sa lahat ng sama ng loob mo sa mga ex mo.  At ang goodbye sa telepono ay nde matapos-tapos, hindi niyo malaman kung sino ang unang magbababa at umaasa kang me "Take care" sa huli. Me email pa yan sa umaga para masabi mo sa kanya na masaya ka na nakapag-usap kayo. Minsang gumimik kayo at upbeat ang sounds, hala! sayaw ka kahit parehong Kaliwa nag mga paa mo, pero gusto niyang sumayaw kaya sige sasayaw ka na rin. Kahit ilang mule, arctic at sub-zero ang orderin niya wala kang pakialam, mas mabuti nga kse nga puede mo na siyang akbayan at I-hug pag medio lasing na siya, pag hindi siya pumalag nako! score! para kang nasa langit.  Malamang, matapos mo siyang ma-hug eh ayaw mo nang maligo at lagi mong naaalala ang scent ng pabango niya na me halong amoy alcohol na pero para sa yo mabango pa din siya.  At siempre tuwing matapos kayong gumimik eh ayaw mo pa rin matapos ang gabi kaya hihirit ka pa ng coffee, kahit isandaan ang isang baso, "So what?!?" kamo, pera lang yan ang importante kasama mo siya.  Masaya ka rin pag na-traffic kayo kse makakapagkuentuhan pa kayo pauwi. Matiyaga mong inaral ang pagda-drive ng manual gamit lang ang isang kamay kse yun isa hawak yun kamay niya o nakadantay sa hita niya habang nag mamaneho ka. Araw-araw magmamakaawa ka na ihatid mo siya at kung puede ka rin niyang Ihatid pauwi, at kung lulusot baka pati lunch eh puede na rin na kayo ang maging lunchmates.  Pag me free time ka eh nasa bookstore ka para nagtingin ng mga puedeng ibigay na greeting cards. Nakalimutan mo na ang barkada mo, para sa yo malaking abala lang sila sa napakagandang lovelife mo kesehodang magtampo pa sila sa yo at magsolian na kayo ng kandila sa inaanak mo sa kanila. At kung aalis man kayo nde ka magkasya sa pagte-text lang sa lab mo, kelangan mong pumunta sa banyo para lang magkarinigan kayo pag tinawagan mo siya at sabihin na nde ka nag-eenjoy at mas gusto mo na siya ang kasama. Pagdating ng weekend nako para kang intsik! alas dies pa lang ng umaga nasa kanila ka na at me dalang suhol na breakfast para sa nanay niyang nakasimangot dahil natutulog pa ang anak niya eh andun ka na.  Pagdating ng gabi kahit antok na antok na siya eh ayaw mo pa ring umuwi, hinihintay mong makatulog siya sa mga bisig mo para makanakaw ka ulit ng kiss.  Iniisip mo rin kung kelan ka kaya niya ipapakilala sa friends niya? Nung kayo na, lahat ng monthsary ice-celebrate niyo, me kasama pang surprise na regalo at date. At nde miminsan mong nabanggit na gusto mo na siyang Pakasalan at wala nang ibang babae sa puso at wala ka nang makikita na katulad niya. AFTER ONE YEAR Mahal ang gimik sa bar, mas maganda kung kakain na lang kayo sa Jollibee at manonood ng sine. Wag na kayo magkape, masyadong mahal with matching comment na "Leche, me ginto ba yan?" Mas gusto mo nang kasama barkada mo dahil "minsan" lang kayo magkita sa isang linggo. Pgakahatid mo sa kanya, nagmamadali kang umuwi sa gabi dahil pagod ka na sa trabaho. Pumapasok at umuuwi na siya mag-isa dahil nde mo siya masusundo dahil puyat ka. Syet! wag ka niyang pipiliting sumayaw at nakakahiya. Anong tawag? Sa load mong 300, mauubos yun at 1 beses mo lang tinext (against 245 na text niya sa yo) at 3 minutes mo siyang natawagan.  Naubos ang load mo kakatawag sa mga barkada mo at kaka forward ng joke sa kanila. Pag weekend mas gusto mong manood na lang  ng TV o matulog. Pupunta ka lang Pag tumawag na siya at nagmamakaawang dalawin mo  naman siya at me suhol na ipinagluto ka niya. Kahit automatic na kotse mo nde mo pa rin makuhang hawakan ang kamay niya habang namamaneho ka. Magastos ang mga monthsary, kung anniversary niyo nga eh wala kang regalo, monthsary pa?!? Mag-uusap kayo? Baket me problema ba? Kung wala, isang oras kang manonood ng TV habang siya eh nakatutulog na kahihintay na kausapin mo siya. Miss na niyang ini-email mo siya,sagot mo? "Jusko naman araw-araw na Tayong nag-uusap ano pa ba naman ang sasabihin ko sa yo? Baka gusto mo pa ng card?!?" Pag aayain ka niya para gumimik with her friends ang sagot mo? "Utang na loob, kung gusto mong lumabas kasama friends mo ikaw na lang mag-isa at naiilang ako." Pero pag lalabas kayo with your friends umiinit ulo mo pag tahimik siya pag nagjo-joke sila tungkol sa inyo ng ex mo sabay tanong "Nde ka ba nag-eenjoy? Buiset, umuwi na nga lang tayo!" At tungkol naman sa kasal..."Jusko naman, nde mo ba ako maintindihan?!? Wala pa akong pera saka nde ko maiisip yan ngayon! Sana wag ka namang makulit." Sa lahat ng ito, ngingiti na lang siya, iisipin lahat ng ginagawa mo noong nanliligaw ka pa  malamang umaasa pa yun na babalik yun dati sabay buntung-hininga at sabi ng malakas..."Kay sarap ng in-love."
