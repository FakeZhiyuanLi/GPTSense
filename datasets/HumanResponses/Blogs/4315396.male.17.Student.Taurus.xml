        TCP/IP    Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) A communications protocol developed under contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to internetwork dissimilar systems. Invented by Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn, this de facto Unix standard is the protocol of the Internet and has become the global standard for communications.TCP provides transport functions, which ensures that the total amount of bytes sent is received correctly at the other end. UDP, which is part of the TCP/IP suite, is an alternate transport that does not guarantee delivery. It is widely used for realtime voice and video transmissions where erroneous packets are not retransmitted.TCP/IP is a routable protocol, and the IP part of TCP/IP provides this capability. In a routable protocol, all messages contain not only the address of the destination station, but the address of a destination network. This allows TCP/IP messages to be sent to multiple networks (subnets) within an organization or around the world, hence its use in the worldwide Internet (see  urlLink Internet address ).The IP network layer (layer 3) of the TCP/IP protocol stack accepts packets from the TCP or UDP transport layer (layer 4), adds its own header and delivers a "datagram" to the data link layer protocol (layer 2).Every client and server in a TCP/IP network requires an IP address, which is either permanently assigned or dynamically assigned at startup. For an explanation of how the various layers in TCP/IP work, see  urlLink TCP/IP abc's  and  urlLink TCP/IP port . See also  urlLink IP address ,  urlLink NFS ,  urlLink NIS ,  urlLink DNS ,  urlLink DHCP ,  urlLink dumb network  and  urlLink IP on Everything .

      Some people come into our lives and quickly go. Others stay for a while and leave footprints on our hearts and we are never ever the same." In real love you want the other person's good. In romantic love you want the other person." Champagne represents the bubbly and overflowing love that I have for you!" "A part of you has grown in me, and, so you see, it's you and me, forever, and never apart; maybe in distance but never in heart." As I gaze upon your beauty, I think to myself, never have I seen an angel fly so low..." You may forget the friends you laughed with, but you will never forget the friends you cried with." There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. When I close my eyes, I still see you... When I take a deep breath, I still smell you... When I lick my lips, I still taste your kiss... You're my obsession.] "A smart girl can open up my mind, a pretty girl can open up my eyes, but only a sweet girl can open up my heart." :) gals are like a piece of gum, when they loose there flavor, you pop in a new one*~* Mirrors don't talk and lucky for you they don't laugh!
