      In dubai i saw the 4th genration ipod   20g for 1350 ed (108 kd)  in virgin megastore. In kuwait the 3rd genration will cost you more than that so iwant to know why virgin megastore in kuwait bring   everything after dubai and sell it more what it cost in dubai. its that in kuwait that some people buy every thing without wait or even if they know they can find  a  new one cheaper.

      Today i will travel to Dubai for fun , buisness and  to forget my stocks in kuwait stock market . I like this city every time you go there you will find new thing new building new services. really they build this city. You can pay your trafic ticket from machine located in city centre, thats good. i hope in kuwait they put this thing, here if you want to pay speed ticket you wait and wait. In Dubai any one want to invest his money in big project they will give him land and help , someone told me that the formula one in Bahrain first they want to build it in kuwait but after late answer from the govenment they go to Bahrain just think what the good thing for kuwait if its done here. See you soon

      the first private  channel  will  broadcast from kuwait its alrai  tv    and its  belong to jassim bodai   (alrai alam) newspaper owner but its like a surprise   cause its come without any  one talk about it . and i think the channel will  show news talk show and some kuwaiti  drama and comedy  series and they will broadcast from the ministry   of information building in salmiya   near souk alsalmiya and  salmiya fire station   maybe the minisrty will rent the building for the alrai tv its good to see  private tv station broadcast from kuwait. you can watch alrai tv on nilesat. thats the start  for private channel to broadcast from kuwait after the govement said ok for media city .
