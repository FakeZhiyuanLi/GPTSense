After starting his career in the oilfields of West Texas, Dutch has gained leadership and operational management experience in many different environments, including energy, retail, healthcare, academia, entertainment and marketing/distribution.   Dutch earned a BA in Communication from McMurry University in 1993 and his MA in Speech Communication from Texas A&M University in 1996.          Testimonials from previous participants:      (WCSNBC) helps you get to a lot of people in a short period of time with the format.           This event has helped me deliver my introduction and takes the stress out of initially meeting people.           I met 5 warm prospects; followed up with them; one sample session given and one expression of interest in future services.           I ran into someone I had met before and it solidified our plans to support each other.           Too soon to tell if I &quot;hit the jackpot&quot;, but I definitely made some extremely high-potential contacts.           Variety of people. Everyone understood what needed to happen so no mixed messages. some more open than others to sharing. Good turnout in numbers for speedy moving forward. Good plans for making the event happen!           The network event was a excellent venue to bring friends, entrepreneurs and prospective business owners together. Very pleased to see so many people having the same kind of issues, situations and moments - thought I was the only one till now. Excellent Event!!           Surprisingly, I made an equal number of contacts that will benefit my business as those that can help a non-profit for which I chair the board of directors. This in spite of the fact that I did not speak of the non-profit's needs. The contacts were an outgrowth of the tremendous diversity of persons present and indicate that you never know what little treasures will be uncovered at such a fun and well-attended event.          Endorsements:      Dutch is a very passionate and committed professional. I have had the pleasure of working with him a few times. &#150; Ira Koretsky           Dutch is creative, articulate, comfortable leading, and brings a lot of experience and vision to what he does. He can really make an event into a productive experience for all involved. He knows what he's doing, and more important, brings out the experience of participants.  &#150; David Mathisen           A wonderful coordinator who has the best interest of the participants in mind. He is always open to new ideas and approaches.  &#150; Bruce Honig          One of the driving forces that has enabled many successful programs to come to fruition.  &#150; Sanford Friedman          Dutch brings enthusiasm, experience and facilitating skills to ensure the success of our network and of our events.            His clarity of communication is unique, invariably his simple observation will create the shortest distance between thought and action . &#150; Peter Rees
