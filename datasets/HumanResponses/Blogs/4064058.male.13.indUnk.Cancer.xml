      I just wanted to let you guys know that if you are looking into buying clothes or parts for you motorcycle, i recomend that you go to C.O.D., which is located right next to Anntonio's Pizza. I just recently got a $25.00 and a $50.00 C.O.D. gift certificate from my brothers and bought a black Renthal Fatbar, and a 7/8 inch to 1 1/8 inch bar clamp. When we went to the counter to buy them, it came out to about $122.00. Then i gave him the gift certficates and he also added a 10% discount! So everything came out to about $43.00! This place was awsome, and the guy that works there was VERY helpful. If you have any questions about C.O.D. you can e-mail me at martymeraz12@msn.com

      I just found this on a forum that i look at.......this guys girlfriend is so messed up!  Im in a VERY ****ING bad mood! i was shopping today with my friend and my girl firend and we took a lunch break at a small cafe for some sandwitches. we was eating and my girl friend went to the toilat. She was in there for a good 10 mins then me and my friend desided to go to the toilat and by the time we get back she will be there. But as i walked into the MEN'S toilat i could hear a girl making noises like she was out of breath it was in a locked toilat so i took a look over and guess what? its my girl friend with some little 11 year old wanker and shes kissing him and he had his little no pubes willy out ready to put it in my girls vigina and i shouted like WTF??? and she look up and saw me and was like the most ****ing shocked person in the world, me and my friend was kicking the ****ing door untill it broke open and my friend ran in there and was kicking the **** out of the little boy, then i punched the boy in the face and swang him out of the toilat and stuffed my fist in his ****ing ugly face and left him there and then i said to my EX girl friend "your just a ****ing slag" and then walked out in a BIG trantrum and went home to take a break.now im the most ****ing deppressed guy in the world, i loved that girl she was lovly but i dident know what she was really like and now it feels like someones put his hand inside my stomach and pulling all my insides out. Love Hurts Im going to doctor tomrow be for i kill my self. i need some anti depressent pills

      After riding my bike at Biggums for 4 hours.........damn i'm tired! Also I would like to tell you about my day......First&nbsp;I woke up at about 9:00 and ate some Applejack's, then I played MX Unleashed for about 15 minutes. Then I took a shower. Then I made my blogger, then i posted, then i did pretty much nothing for a couple hours. Then my dad brought me lunch. I had the Steak nacho's from CARL's JR./GREEN BURRITO. Then I did pretty much nothing for a couple of hours. Then I went up to my brothers house to babysit&nbsp;my neice with my mom.  Then I came home and rode at Biggums until dark. That was my day!
