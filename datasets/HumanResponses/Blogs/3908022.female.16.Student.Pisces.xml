      I have a feeling that this is getting redundant. The only thing I ever write about is misery! If I ever write anything positive, it's without real emotion. I think I've been so depressed that the only feelings I can express are the negative ones. But, I'm going to try to write a positive post today.   Maroon 5 are eating their way into my heart and mouth(Which means that I love them and I sing their songs all the time... ). The lyrics are, as most, not very deep in most cases. But a few songs really have the depth that I look for in a song. I don't find that very often. I'm also thinking about making a Gavin DeGraw CD.   Yes, I burn most of my CD's, not all of us are able to spend a fortune on CD's every month. I have clothes to buy.   Gavin DeGraw is a very good artist and I believe his songs to be positively amazing. His voice is not beautiful but he sounds secure of himself and relaxed. That is always a plus... Relaxation, and not just in music.   Another positive thing is that working really makes me feel good about myself... (partly, partly not.)  I feel that I  am  doing  something worth while . When I feed those people, make them laugh and make them food,&nbsp;I just feel that it means something. That I, for once, is doung something for someone else. But the fact that I'm making money of this, of course, takes away part of that pride.   The weekend's coming up and I can't wait to kick back and relax.

      OK, so there are three different departments. And there were three summer workers, including myself. And guess who gets to work in the dementia ward? ME! Who else, me and my fucking bad luck?  It's not so bad, though. Not really. I mean, the things I get to do are not disgusting or actually hard in anyway at all. Actually, all I get to do is make beds, make porridge, sandwiches, water the flowers, feed the cat and the fishes, do the dishes and feed one of the people who live there. The staff is really nice to me and I'm very well taken care of. The old people, though they all have some sort of mental illnesses, they are really nice and charming. That's not the problem either, and I have no problem whatsoever with feeding them or talking to them or anything.  No, the thing that makes me uncomfortable is on a whole other level.  It's that feeling I get, when I go in to Agnes'(one of the ladies there, she's in a wheelchair. She can't walk, and can barely move at all, except her arms.) room. I go over to her window and spot the row of framed pictures. My eyes stop at her wedding picture. There's no actual way to know that it is her, but I assume so. The beautiful woman I the picture with the perfect smile, joy shining from her face. Her eyes were so alive and she was healthy. She was sane, she was young and unspoiled. And I go to the dinner room where Agnes now is sitting. I see the same eyes, instead of joy they seem dead. The spark in that picture is long gone.  That feeling is what I can't stand. That feeling of seeing what they have become, understanding, having to realize that for some people that's the way of life.  Agnes is now the woman who forgets what she's eating in between chews.   Signe is another old woman there. She always repeats anything you tell her. Sometimes she answers, but not often. Her husband came to visit today, Signe didn't even acknowledge his presence. After a while, she noticed who he was and said "Are we going home soon?".  As if they were both going home and as if everything was normal again.  I sat there next to her with tears in my eyes. I don't know how to do this. I need help. I need someone to help me through this. I can't do it by myself.  I just can't.

      Tomorrow, I start my new job. It's at a retirement home and I'm scared to death. I don't think I've ever been this afraid of doing or saying the wrong thing. I can only imagine what I'll feel like the day before I start my new school. I want people to like me. I want to do a good job. I want to deserve the payment that I'll get. (No matter how small the amount of money is.) I need help, I think. I keep thinking that everything I heard at the introduction day just went in one ear and out the other. I feel like I've forgotten the most basic things. And I don't know how to make porridge! That's minus points, right there. And I especially don't know how to make it at 7.30 am!! I'm a walking dead at 7.30! How can anyone focus on anything that early in the morning. I'm so scared.

      Sooner or later everything is put in just that, perspective.  Everything&nbsp;changes  from  day to day . Perhaps even from hour to hour,   minute to minute  .   Opinions, opportunities, abilities and feelings. They all change. Far  too often , if you ask me. I'm always different. And everywhere I go, it's different the next time I come. Everyone I meet is different the next time I meet them. That's the thing about being a kid.  Which I consider myself to be.   Everyone changes. We're all so easily influenced.   For example. One year ago, the only music I ever listen to was R&amp;B and Hiphop, sometimes soul. I hated everything else. Not because I actually disliked it, but because I was in that crowd. The stuck up, mean, wannabe black,'I'm better than you' crowd. And trust me,  I wasn't particularly happy in that clique . I only had 3 friends that I considered real ones.   Now I have 10 friends like that. That I love with all my heart. I love all sorts of music (except for Country and Techno music). And I'm  happier . It was a hard transition, though.  This past year has been   the best year of my life  , but it has also been the  hardest . I feel that I'm so much closer to finding myself. I'm not there yet, though.  But I've come a long way. No matter how hard it was to face my feelings towards myself. Facing them was nothing compared to actually trying to beat them, though. I haven't beaten them yet, sadly. That's going to take some time. I need time to like myself. I have to like myself in order to really like others. I know that's some  stupid psycho babble bullshit  but I actually  believe it .   Another thing I believe is that every decision we make, we've already decided. Every decision is decided for already, by ourselves. We always want one or the other. Doubt is just ourselves feeling guilty...  Did that make sense?  Who cares....? haha. I know what I meant, and I am the only person who has to get it.   Now I have to go back to reality.   My journey of finding myself  .

      So, I guess it started Saturday, when Yorda called and told me that if I wanted to I could stay the night with her, Matilda and Amanda at Amanda's house. And I wanted to, of course. So I packed my bag and went to Yorda's apartment to celebrate her birhtday. I know I've already done that, but her mother has this thing every year where she bakes   a lot    of cookies and makes    a lot    of food. And Amanda, Matilda and I were invited to come. So we ate as much as we could and then we were all high on sugar and really funny. Or, we were just really easy to entertain... I'm actually going with the latter.   &nbsp; So, then we bought some pizza and&nbsp;went to Amanda's home. She lives kind of&nbsp;in the&nbsp;countryside.&nbsp;There are cows and&nbsp;a really bad smell.  Anyhow, so when we got there, there was this group of friends of Amanda's. Martin, Justus, Andreas and Ida. They all seemed nice and&nbsp;we hung out with them and we had fun and so on.  But, suddenly, late,late,&nbsp;late at night. When we were all hanging out&nbsp;in the room where we were going to sleep.  The&nbsp;bizarreness started.  They started to touch eachother, in not friendy ways. And say really offending things to eachother, involving lots and lots of words involving sexual organs. So to&nbsp;speak. And then I realized, they&nbsp;had known eachother forever. And instead of forming a mental closeness, they had formed&nbsp;some form of an extreme&nbsp;physical closeness instead. I just thought it was grotesque. When they had gone,&nbsp;Amanda, Yorda, Matilda and I&nbsp;had a lot&nbsp;of fun though.&nbsp;It's not&nbsp;as if I'm suddenly disgusted with Amanda, because she's not&nbsp;disgusting&nbsp;when she's with us.&nbsp;But I'm not sure if I ever want to meet those people again. The morning after, when we&nbsp;were on the bus home, me, Matilda&nbsp;and Yorda,&nbsp;we discussed&nbsp;it all. And they'd thought it was disturbing also. &nbsp; When I got in to&nbsp;the&nbsp;city, I went by bus directly&nbsp;to the next friend. Linn! She'd been in Holland for 10 days,&nbsp;and I had really missed her. Because I was in Italy before and the day I came&nbsp;home she went&nbsp;away. So I hadn't seen her in more than 3 weeks. Which is very unusual for us. So we hung out, talked and she&nbsp;brought me some candy and bath pearls.  After that, we decided with our parents that she was going to&nbsp;sleep at my house for the next two nights.  &nbsp; And she did... hehe. There's not much to tell. We talked, walked and watched TV... and slept... a little. And my grandmother came by, and she's giving me a pearl necklace, so we went to the goldsmith to fix that. As it turns out, she decided to give me another necklace too. I'm guessing she was in a giving mood or something. I like it. So today she went home and I've been kicking back and relaxing ever since. It's good to be alone sometimes... no matter how much&nbsp;I love her. &nbsp;  Freedoom.

      Why does everything have to be so damn complicated?  Is it really a part of growing up? Life getting more complicated? I don't get the point of that. I always complicate things even more, too. I always read way too much into everything. And I hate that about me. I can't just accept something and live with it. No, I have to analyze it over and over and over again. Until everyone's sick of me.  &nbsp; That totally sucks. &nbsp;

       So, yesterday I kind of had a fall back. Depression.  I know that  I'm a teenager and that that's what we do . We get depressed, and it's nothing that's unique about me. But it still hurts.  &nbsp;  I was sick. With depression last year and the beginning of this year. It started somewhere around September 2003 and ended in March 2004. But, really, it started before that. Actually I think it's been there for as long as I can remember.   The uncertainty. Never daring to trust anyone, at least not for real. I'm very reserved as a person. Even though I talk openly about things. I don't open up to just anyone. There are a few select people that get to see who I really am. But, there are even fewer that I really, truly trust. They are the people&nbsp;I love to death.  &nbsp;   You know that thing  where you're supposed to fall back into someone else's arms when they're standing behind you? You're supposed to trust them?  Maybe you don't know about it...   Anyhow, I've only dared to do that once. Once in my 16 years of living.  People always nagged me about it. But, I think I have a problem with trust. But, only one way of trust. I mean, I trust a few people with my feelings and my opinions. But, the real kind of trust. Where I'd put my life in someone else's hands. That's the kind of trust I have a problem with.  How ever, the only time I ever did that fall back into someone's arms - thing was one time last year. With one of my best friends.  She's someone I really trust. Because she's so honest with me. And no matter how much honesty can hurt sometimes, there's nothing I appreciate more.  &nbsp;   I was sick.. Back to that.   I was sick. Depressed, doubting everyone who claimed that they loved me, hating myself. Truly hating. Sometimes I would stand in front of the mirror wishing I could cut the skin off of my face, without anyone noticing. And I think I would've cut it off. If I didn't know that pealing your skin off gets you attention and not the good kind.  And that was the last thing I wanted at the time, attention.   &nbsp;  But, I cut my wrists. That's&nbsp;another one of those  "All teenagers&nbsp;do that"  things. And&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;I felt that it didn't matter so&nbsp;much if I did it too.  It felt so good. Putting the&nbsp;knife to my skin.&nbsp; Feeling it cut through my skin, all my pain just pouring out.   In the form of blood .  It sounds sick, I know that .  But that's how I felt . It was an outlet for my feelings.  I wanted to die. To leave everything behind. Let go of it all, not having to worry anymore. But my friends noticed that I was hurting myself. And they were crying and screaming at me not to do it. I hated seeing them like that. But I still couldn't really feel that it was my fault. Which&nbsp;I know it was.  &nbsp;  I also had eating disorders, weeks could go by with me just eating an apple a day. And I just wasn't hungry. That's what I said when people asked. It was logical to me. I wasn't hungry. So, why eat?  I had this thing I did: In the morning, I didn't eat breakfast, so mom was worried and asked me why. I said that I'd buy&nbsp;breakfast and eat a huge lunch at school.  Of course I didn't buy breakfast! Where would I get the money to do that?  Then at lunch, my friends were worried about me not eating, so I said that I had a big breakfast and that I was going to eat snacks when I got home from school.  Then at dinner, mom's worried again, and I tell her that I ate really much at lunch.  It worked most of the time. And I didn't see that there was anything wrong with it. Which is crazy to me now.  &nbsp;  I&nbsp;got help. Or, rather my best friend found out and forced me to get help.  I talked to a counselor, and I really thought that I was better.&nbsp;She was proud of me&nbsp;and I felt happy again. Not happy all the time. But normal, the normal ups and downs. And I&nbsp;ate&nbsp;the right way, too.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Everything was normal,  until last night .  &nbsp;  Suddenly, I just found myself thinking: "nothing changed! I'm still as ugly as I ever was. I'm still stupid. And what makes me think that my friends love me? What has&nbsp;changed? Nothing!!"  &nbsp;  So&nbsp;I started thinking about all of that. And I cut myself.&nbsp;It just felt so amazing.&nbsp;Once again, my problems and all the hurt just&nbsp;went with the blood.  Not that&nbsp;it bled a&nbsp;lot, because it really didn't.  But it felt good.   &nbsp;  And now I don't know what to do.  &nbsp;  I don't know if it was a one time thing, last night.  &nbsp;  I hope so. Because I really can't go through that hell again.  I don't think I'll survive that again.    &nbsp;  I hate my self pitying.   &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;

      Today I bought Yorda her Birthday -lunch. I love doing things like that for her, cause she so genuinely appreciates it. She thinks it's so sweet. And I love that. I'm celebrating her birthday with Amanda, Matilda, Filippa and maybe a girl named Ida on Saturday. That's going to be fun. Her mom always cooks for a thousand. :)  But anyways... As Yorda and I were walking down the streets of our city, I spot the guy that I have a major crush on. And he's smoking!!!!!!!!!!! That's so fucking repulsive!!!! GOD!!!! I can't even begin to describe how turned off I was by that! Geeez!  I can't even talk about this anymore.

      Sometimes I can be such a complete ass!  Everyone can, but this time it was my turn.  You know who you are(Madda), and I'm sorry! I'm sorry that I'm selfish some times. It's just that I really want to talk to me. And you not daring to speak to me feels like you don't want to. And you not even daring to talk to me makes it even further away that we will ever meet, you know? And I am so ready for that. I feel like I could see you tomorrow. Cause you really are one of my best friends to me. Not just someone I talk to here. You are so real to me. I just want to make it even more real. Cause that's just showing how much I care about you! You mean so much to me! And I'm so sorry that I hurt you. But you hurt me to, even if you don't mean to. Just so you know.    Love you!

      Today has been a good day.  A very good day , so far :) I called Linnea twice yesterday but she was out both times. So the phone woke me up today, she called. It was great to talk to her again, I really miss her. We decided to meet sometime next week. That's going to be great! Then I remembered that it's my friend  Yorda's birthday today . So I called her, and she found that very  sweet ! :D  Tomorrow I'm taking her out for birthday lunch. I really miss her too. But not the same way. Cause she'll be in my class this fall. So I know that I'll see her a lot anyhow. But I still miss her.  After I talked to them I went to the tiny amusement park with my mother and the kids at the Kindergarden where she works. I helped out, cause I love kids. And I saw a  gorgeous  guy that works there. His name is  Olle  and he's one year older than me. He's so hot! :D  I smile just thinking about him...    After that we went to get ice cream! Let me tell yu, kids are not good at eating ice cream! By the time we were done, they had ice cream all over themselves. It's unbelievable.  *sighs*  Now I'm home relaxing. Waiting for tomorrow to come.    I love my friends! :)

      So today my parents were going to IKEA. And politely asked if I wanted to come. No, I did not want to come.  And why is that?  I asked myself later.  No idea! I have no idea! Instead of going shopping for things I actually need. I choose to sit here, alone.  How much fun is that on a scale from one to ten?     One and a half.     But at least today I'm going to call Linnea. I promised to call her a week ago, when I came home from Italy. But that just didn't happen. Today it will, though. I've got to talk to her. I feel like such a bad friend for not calling her. :(  And what can I do about my room? It's so ugly! :D I want to make changes. But there's to much wrong about it. I can't just change a little, I have to change alot. And I don't think I have the money to do that. So, maybe I shouldn't change it. I could just keep it ugly.  Yeah, I'll keep it ugly. Who cares?   I do.

      Dear God! I'm so tired and my head is thumping. It's like I have a midget and his five giant sisters walking around up there!  And how much sense did that make? None! That's right. I'm so sick of this.  So my grumpy mood started when I went to this concert. The object of my affection sings and plays the guitar. He's  20 years old ... I'm 16. I've never talked to him. He has the voice of an angel and he's amazing on guitar. He also seems to be so cool, he has such a cool style and he also has a girlfriend.  I first noticed him because he works at my favorite coffee shop. Whenever he serves me anything I'm grinning from ear to ear. I'm such a teenager! ARGH! I'm so mad at myself for being so pathetic.  Anyways, so I went to that concert, and I drank alcohol for the first time in my life. (If you cout sips of champagne out.) So I was all tipsy and I drank beer, which I hate and my best friend smoked. Which was kind of hard for me to deal with cause I never thought of her like that. But most of all, I never thought of me like this. Drinking. It's not me. I'm the responsible one, the smart one with plans and a future. I'm not one of those girls.  But Saturday night,  I was .  And of course I got a bad conscience. So I told my parents that I drank. Of course I didn't dare to tell them exactly what I drank, so I made that up a little when they asked. But I just had to tell them, no matter how scared I was of doing just that. I'm such a goody-goody! Now that's annoying me! God, there's no way to be with out me annoying myself! GOD!  And I'm still confused about my choice of school for this fall. I chose to go to Media-school. Cause I want to be a journalist. But then I thought of going to a music-school cause I love singing.  And I don't know if I've confused my dreams with what I should want. If maybe I'm not so good at writing even though people tell me that. Maybe I'm not meant to do any of it. Maybe I'm supposed to be a counselor or a teacher.  What do I know!?   I'm extremely confused, and my head aches.   This is it for me. I hope no one reads this, for their own sake.   *sighs*    Elin       Read the first chapter of my  urlLink story ... and please review! I forgot to put in an Author's note.. I'll do that in the next chapter!

      Okay, I don't care how ditzy this sounds, but,  not even shopping cheered me up ! It usually gives me a feeling of completeness for a very short while, which usually makes me forget about my problems for a very short while. Today, it didn't. On one hand, that might be because I didn't actually shop. I ordered. But still. And, plus, I ordered shoes that won't go with a lot of my clothes so now I have to buy clothes to go with the shoes I just bought. Which means that I have to spend more of the money that I've earned. Which I do not want to do. Yesterday I got the pearl necklace from my grandmother. It turns out that that necklace is worth like $400! I'm a little freaked out about that... I don't have any necklace that expensive. (Which proves that I'm not rich...) And I have no idea when to wear it.. :S  One of the things cheering me up, though, is reading all the amazing stories at:  urlLink http://trory.de-nile.net  They are great.!!!  And my Uggs are out of stock!!!!! :'( I'm so bummed about that. But they've been out of stock before, so hopefully they'll come back again.  Over- and - out.

      This is one of those days.  One of the days I hate the most.  It is the days when I feel no purpose. Today, I felt no purpose. I feel like my life is so completely unneccesary. I feel so alone and unwanted. Maybe I am.  I can't really know that.  I have moments when it feels like everything happens for a reason. So, I guess the negative feelings have reasons too. Only, I don't want to see those reasons. Tonight I really feel like taking my life... of course I won't, though. I never do. But, the worst thing is that no one really cares. No one really cares if I'm alive or not. And even if they do, I can guarantee that they'd get over my death fast. I'm such an avrage person. I blend in. My looks blend in, my personality blends in. I don't stand out. At all.  I wish I found my person. The one that'd be there always, always. And so many times, I've lead my self to believe that I have found that person. But I seem to be wrong each time.  I wish I stood out. I wish I was noticed.  I wish I was well liked.  I wish I was loveable.  I wish I was...    I wish.
