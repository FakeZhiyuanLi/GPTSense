      first day back at school today only to find a load of exams waiting for me, as well as a bunch of rumours. Its amazing what little kids think up when someone is away for a while...apparently according to the "cool" girls at school im pregnant and i have been kicked outta home, umm no, lol im so amazed,people neva grow up, just because i wasn't bread in fu*king captivity! So i sat my english exam today and that seemed to go well, i hope. i still dont wanna go back but you know, only a week till holidays. Mah life is messed, i think i really need to breath i mean iu do have everything i could want...except that 60$ jacket i want :o) im 17 in love and i have a pretty great social life, yet still something isnt right. no matter what i do something messes up, it seems to be i cant be right. oh well i guess ill have to wait this out, and see what happens i mean as my baby said "the only place you can go when your down is up." ill catch up later. cya.

      Today I got like an hour talk from mum saying trying to figure out what my problem is, see I cant go back to school because I died my hair, and that's cool because I don't want to, but if I don't I wont get where I want to get to in uni, if I even get to uni. It sucks because I am being made to make my life decision now, pretty much the worst time it could happen. I have been having trouble lately with loads of things. And mainly it has been school, a chick there has been giving me trouble for a while now I would love to beat the living shit outta her, but unfortunately at a Christian school its kind of, well not allowed. She has managed to turn the school against me and I hate, and I mean hate being there...I don't want to go back. But I don't have any other plans I Don't know what to do, I wanna be in the art business but I cant with out uni qualifications even though I don't think ill make it that far anyway. If anyone has any ideas on how to help my problem, mainly the chick at school please let me know. Thanks :o)

      Wow today I got my hair died from blonde to what I thought would be dark blonde to light brownie colour, as it turns out its now orange, I mean it looks okay BUT its not what I wanted. I now look like I have dipped my head into a pool of orange goo. I mean its ok, but could be better. Well I guess I can say it signifies a new start to a new me, as I wanted a change anyway, the process has only just begun, I will keep changing bit by bit but yeah, this is a start...ill keep you posted.
