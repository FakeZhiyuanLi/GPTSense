      Jason’s post asked how the Republican party got to be the way it is and then approached the question of how its current composition makes sense today.  As the historian in the bunch, I’ll see what I can do on the “how it got to be this way” question.    Big businessmen (or corporatists) have been Republicans for a long time.  The party always stood for the interests of industry.    Past that, I’d point to three forces.  The new deal drove small government/libertarian folks to the Republican Party.  If you were for small government, you couldn’t be a Democrat.  And with only two viable parties, that made the decision easy.    The declining political importance of the civil war was another crucial factor.  As the civil war receded in memory, Southern conservatives could increasingly choose their party rather than be Democrats by default.    When the sixties came along, radical lefties and Republican strategy drove southern conservatives to the Republican Party.  Radical lefties were bound to be Democrats because they favored the new deal and the ideology behind it.  Radicals also favored pacifism, civil rights and other non-traditional cultural values.    Republicans therefore had an easy time picking off southern social conservatives because southern social conservatives didn’t like the radical lefties and they were available.  All Republicans had to do was go easy on civil rights and advocate “law and order” (restraining hippies and blacks) and they got the South.  Since most Southerners were Christian conservatives, they entrenched Christian conservatism in the Republican Party.  This drew Christian conservatives, wherever they happened to live.  The sixties also made it clear that hawkish folks should leave the Democratic Party.  Radical lefties were Democrats and the horror of Vietnam tilted the rest of the party their way.  Prior to that, Democrats had been muscular folks, leading us into WWI, WWII, Korea and Vietnam.  Since then, we’ve had a hard time coming up with a foreign policy strategy other than “war is bad… but we’re happy to support successful wars after the fact”.  So Republicans had libertarians, hawks and corporatists.  This doesn’t make much sense from an ideological perspective.  Republicans are all against social spending, but that’s about all they agree on.  It isn’t that they’re for social responsibility or individual responsibility.  Social conservatives are all for an intrusive government and religious/social atmosphere that coerces people into making the “right” choices.  Libertarians disagree completely.  Corporatists aren’t really interested that much in these sorts of questions.  All this only makes sense from a historical perspective.  Once folks of your stripe are in a party, path dependence takes over.  It’s much easier to go along with the inertia and follow the rest of them to the party they’ve chosen.  Years later, it may make little sense ideologically.  But your group’s cash and muscle is already entrenched somewhere, why fight it?    Mike

      A beef before I get back to what Joe wrote:  Check out  urlLink this taxpayer-funded press release , dated April 9, by the Treasury Department about how the IRS is making it easier to file your taxes this year.  Scroll down to the bottom and read the bold italic section.  Now look at  urlLink this RNC piece , dated April 2.  Scroll down to the second-to-the-last bullet point.

       Responsibility and the hawk/dove split:  Just to clear the air, when I reference hawks and doves here, I'm implying some rational boundaries.  IE, doves are people who oppose war and violence in general, but not categorically - they would have supported WWII.  In the same way, hawks may be either neutral or predisposed to using force, but they're not all like Curtis LeMay.  These categories also break down when there are incredibly divisve leaders: Gincrich v. Clinton in 1994, and Bush v. The Democrats nowadays.    A more difficult exercise is disaggregating the Democrats the way we've been breaking down the Republicans (Libertarians, Corporatists, Conservative Christians, and Macho Hawks).  Much of this difficulty stems from the inclusive nature of Liberalism, especially the modern Democratic Party.  Still, I think that one can br created that closely mirrors the right' categories.  For the sake of argument, let's call them Free Thinkers, Brahmin, Liberal Sectarians, and Ideologues.  Your average Naderite would be equal parts Free Thinker and Ideologue (I know, it looks like a contradiction in terms, but I'm writing this on the fly), Catholic Democrats would be Liberal Sectarians, and Ted Kennedy would be Brahmin.  Now, on to war.   Perhaps the most useful way of breaking this down initially is to look at doves and hawks on both sides of the aisle.  1)Conservative Doves: Yes, they can exist.  They're few and far between, but people like Pat Buchanan and Dick Armey weren't exactly singing the praises of invading Iraq this time around.  They believe that their responsibility is first and foremost to the American people, and if  urlLink reports like this  are right, they actually comprise a small yet growing section of the base.  I suspect that most of these are Libertarians (who don't think they have a dog in most international fights) and Conservative Christians (who don't like the sight of body bags).    2)Conservative Hawks: Think that the best way to fulfill their responsibilities to America is to vigorously and actively defend her security.  They seem more willing to attack existential threats to US security than concrete threats to the security of other countries (IE, Latin America policy in the 1980's vs. Somalia).  For examples, look to most of the Editorial Board of  urlLink National Review.   3)Liberal Doves: Probably the most diverse group, because their feelings of responsibility map all over the chart.  Some believe, like the Conservative Doves, that we have an overwhelming responsibility only to our citizens, and should only use force when directly threatened.  Some think we bear a moral responsibility to everyone, that all life is sacred, and war is never the  urlLink answer .  Most, however, believe strongly in alternative forms of conflict resolution, the power of multilateral and multinational institutions, and the ability of negotiation to settle disputes.  So this category runs the gamut from "we have no responsibility for outside conflicts" to "we have an overwhelming responsibility not to kill our fellow man" to "if we spread the responsibility wide enough, maybe people will finally listen."  4) Liberal Hawks: The strange bedfellows of the neocons.  Willing to use force to help solve the concrete harms of distant others, and use the credibility-of-threat built there to combat existential harms to the US.  They're generally a mix of pragmatism (we'll fight the wars where there is a definite concrete harm) with ideology (yes, we have the balls to say something someone else is doing is bad because it's antidemocratic/racist/genocidal, etc).  Clinton was moving in this direction come his second term.  Their secondary sense of responsibility (the primary being US security) is to those that they can best help.  This entire post was a really long way of saying that it's quite hard to apply a "responsibility" metric in evaluating the willingness to use force.  It can help explain where the force would be targeted, but analysis beyond that becomes dodgy.  Co-bloggers?  Ideas?

      I'll try to expand on Jason's post  urlLink below  without falling too deeply into the "Republicans value personal responsibility while Democrats value social responsibility" meme that's been floating around.  I'll tackle the dove/hawk question in a moment, but here's a few thoughts on the Kleiman/Drum points (and on Amarnath):  1) Libertarians find the GOP sexy because they tend to promote small government more than the Democrats.  It's not that they want to redistribute wealth upward, they don't like to redistribute it, period.  Responsibility here goes hand in hand with freedom, particularly the freedom to do what you want with what you've rightly earned (the fruits of your labor).  This is the main part of the base that Bush II has been alienating - if you're a fan of Hayek, you're probably not a fan of new Medicare entitlements.  2) The reason that Drum is wrong is hidden in his own  urlLink post .  He writes that conservative hatred of liberals began "when television started beaming all this liberalism directly into everyone's living rooms."  Each side has public faces - moreso now because of the internet (we wouldn't be politico-blogging if we weren't really, really into politics, would we?), and these public faces are jockeying for position.  When it seems like the public face of Conservativism is a jackbooted Ann Coulter, and Liberalism is represented by a foaming-at-the-mouth Michael Moore, it's really easy to "hate" the "enemy" if they're as ridiculously over-the-top as those two.  There are definite uniting themes for both sides, but defending yourself from the most despicable venom spewed by the other side has relegated those themes to the back seat.    I mean, look at anything posted by  urlLink Atrios : he's a left Democrat, though not too extreme - just snarky.  And he can help shape a lot of public opinion (or channel it) thorough that snarkiness.  So to end this meandering section (and I promise I'll try to find more concrete examples of this): Drum is right in his reasons, but his reasons don't lead to the conclusion he sets out to prove.  He doesn't show why Jerry Falwell and Eugene Volokh vote together, he just shows why Bill O'Reilly and Noam Chomsky don't.    War stuff to come later this evening.

      Mike made a post on his Xanga blog a while ago about  urlLink why he thought it would be good for the Democrats if Arnold Schwarzenegger ran for president .  The comments on the post drifted toward categorizations of Republicans.  I proposed, and Mike more or less agreed, that there are four main types of modern American Republicans: Liberatarians, Corporatists, Conservative Christians, and Macho Hawks.  This raises the question, why are these four groups grouped into a political party?  If the Republican party is the party of conservatism, what is the conservative thread that holds these groups together?  Kevin Drumm  urlLink explores this a bit  at his blog, and cites Mark Kleiman who  urlLink thinks that what unites conservatives is their desire to redistribute wealth upward .  Kevin disagrees, and concludes that hatred of liberals is what unites conservatives, and, likewise, hatred of conservatives is what unites liberals.  I don't like either hypothesis.  (An aside before we get deep into this: The tetrachotomy outlined above is theoretical construct.  Just as with all typologies, very few people are wholly one thing or another.  Perhaps it's best for classifying attitudes rather than actual persons.  Dick Cheney might be a good archetype as a corporatist, but he's also to a lesser degree a Macho Hawk.)  Mark commits the classic fallacy of concluding that because Libertarians, Corporatists, Conservative Christians, and Macho Hawks all vote for people whose policies transfer wealth upward, they must actively all want that result.  California Republicans tend to vote for actors a lot in gubernatorial elections.  Does this mean that California Republicans think it's important that an actor occupy the Governor's Mansion?  In fact, only Corporatists actively want the rich to get richer as an end in itself; Libertarians are content to let it happen in a free market, and Conservative Christians and Macho Hawks don't really care either way.  Kevin's hypothesis isn't that satisfying either.  While a common enemy goes a long way to uniting groups, it doesn't explain why  these  four groups should be united.  I'm not the political historian in the bunch, so I'll leave it to Mike or Joe or Jon or Andrew to explain how the makeup of the Republican Party came to be the way it is, but I am going to try to rationalize the current composition.  I once got into a political argument with Amarnath, a Libertarian who was able to mount an impressive (by Williams standards) argument in favor of libertarianism.  At one point, I said that one of his beliefs was "irresponsible", and then he spent some time talking about how libertariansim is all about taking responsibility.  We talked past each other for a while before it became apparent that we had a different idea of what "responsibility" in the political-theoretical sense meant.  Amarnath's political idea of responsibility is that you are responsible for what happens to you.  If you can't get a job, that's because of your shortcomings--try harder.  If you can't save enough for your kids' college funds, you need to manage your finances better or have fewer children.  If you get pregnant accidently, you should have been more careful--no easy abortion.  If your child has trouble paying attention, you should have done a better job bringing him or her up--no blaming things on ADHD.  (Amarnath wouldn't make the abortion point, but I'm trying to find something that ties together conservatives of all stripes.)   A liberal view of responsibility focuses on taking responsibility for the effects your actions have on others.  Hence environmentalism, (hyper?)sensitivity to marginalized minorities, emphasis on helping (or at least not hurting) the poor.  I can't get the dove/hawk split to work with this responsibility idea.  Someone help me.  Or provide an alternative.

      I interrupt the posts on moral luck and heroism to bring you  urlLink  the greatest DVD of all time .  Jason and I saw Bubba Ho-Tep at the Angelica the day after it came out in NYC, and  the idea of an aged Elvis and an aged (and black) JFK is still incredible on DVD.

      I think the point you raise leads into a broader question about "moral luck", the idea that the morality of an action can depend on circumstances beyond your control.  In the abstract, we would tend to reject the legitimacy of moral luck, but in practice, we praise and condemn people all the time for, in part, being lucky or unlucky.  If I'm driving inattentively, and happen to not cause an accident, fine, no one really cares that much.  But if I turn my eyes from the road the second a child runs out to chase a ball, and I hit the child, then I'm inexcusably negligent and roundly condemned.  As this applies to heroism, the fact that we really only use the term when a) there is a risk and b) the putative hero knows about the risk, means that in the case of heroism at least, we buy into moral luck.  As you say, heroes are courageous, put themselves in real danger, and are on our side.  They're better than people who only  think  they're putting themselves into danger.

      A related question: what if you think there's a risk, but there isn't one?  Say, you think you're crossing a minefield, but it isn't actually there.  In that case, you might reasonably believe there's a minefield.    What if your belief is unreasonable?  Say, you're nuts and you think that little green men will kill you if you walk out the door.  Are you heroic if you brave the little green men?  The psychology may be the same if you merely believe in the risk, and indeed, if you unreasonably believe in the risk.  But is that enough?

      Not realizing that continuity is important, I "responded" to Mike:  I guess that's why the "father, why have you forsaken me?" is so important.  Cuz if Jesus never had any doubts that everything would be all right in the end, then he didn't really do anything that heroic.  It'd be like the magician's assitant who lets herself get cut in half, knowing full well that it's an illusion.  Joe [and Andrew and Larry, now that this is on Tua Mater], as the nominally religious person here, what are your thoughts?

      In response to Jason's "what is heroism question", I answered:    Heroism is perspective dependant.  You think someone is heroic if they take a large risk in a considered manner to do something you feel is good.     Plainly, risk is involved.    The risk also has to be considered (known and, perhaps, weighed against the gain if the risker succeeds): if my perception is impaired (say, from drinking too much wiskey) and I unknowingly take a big risk to do something good, I'm not heroic, I'm just drunk and either lucky or unlucky.     And it has to be for something good. Nazis aren't heroic if the scope of your consideration includes their evil deeds.  For instance, an individual german soldier could be heroic in saving a friend- if all you think about is his saving the friend, he's doing something good.  But taking big risks to put up guard towers at concentration camps isn't heroic.

      Busy as ever at work, Mike sent Joe and me an email detailing the passage of an important bill:  > Bill Key: PA HR 759 > Source ID: BOTH > Title: War Dogs > Version: Adopted >  > Honors the courage, heroism and sacrifice of war dogs.  Harmless enough, right?  Well, leaving aside the issue of whether non-humans can be heroes, the bill raises the question, "what is heroism?"

      Political tactics should be taught in college.  By this, I mean people graduating from fine institutions like Williams ought to be able to take classes in the art of practical politics: coalition buildling, horsetrading, using wedge issues to divide the other guys coalition etc.   Hear me out.  There is a set of skills that can be called political tactics and they're useful to people going to places like our beloved alma mater.  Why not teach them?  So, how do we know that there is such a set of skills?  Well, we see it in the world around us.  Some politicians are known as good "tactical politicians" like Clinton, Tom DeLay and Lyndon Johnson- folks who know how to make the right deals, build coalitions, enforce dicipline on followers, use the power of patronage etc. to get what they want.  In the business world, people know about "office politics", folks who know how to compete for power in the organization.  How would we teach them?  I don't know exactly- I haven't studied political tactics per-se.  But people pick up lots of methods anicdotally from studying history and political science.  Surely, we could come up with various theories of how to effectively use political power.  Students could consider hypotheical cases and write papers on how they'd solve the problem and study decisionmakers and how they had used their power effectively or ineffectively.  Strategists often begin by trying to figure out what the basic tactical moves are.  So, commanders of armies often say that there are really only about six tactical methods for major battles- every strategy is one of these or a combination: stuff like 1. attack in the center, 2. attack on the flank, 3. attack on both flanks, 4. defend, 5.  pretend to defend, actually attack. 6. feint, then attack etc.  Knowing these basic elements of tactics clarifies your thinking when you approach complex real problems.  You can say- well, I'm confused- what if I attack in the center- no that won't work because of x and so on.  I'll take a shot at defining the basic elements of political tactics.  There are three- every ultimate strategy is a variation on these or a combination of them: 1.  Promise someone something, 2. Threaten someone with something. 3. Persuade someone of something.  Everything you do is some sort of combination of these and thinking in these terms clarifies your thought.    Now I'll use these elements to critique our decision to disband the Iraqi army.  I'll argue that we ought to have sent them home and paid them and then vetted particular units and stood them up to use on our behalf.  Paying these folks allows us to promise them something: if you stick with us, you'll continue to get paid.  If you pass the vetting process, you'll get your job and social standing back.  Since we're promising you all this, you won't screw with us in the interm.    This promise also gives us a power of persuasion.  Lots of Iraqis hadn't decided if they could trust the US.  When we've got loads of folks around who like us (ex-soldiers), they'll become agents of persasion on our behalf.  Everyone is connected to a soldier in some way- when that soldier says "well, the americans are infidels and will burn in hell, but they're feeding my family and if I do what they wan't, I'll be a soldier again- so they're not so bad", then we get lots of persuasive power because folks trust cousin Achmed and if cousin Achmed likes us, maybe they should too.  Plus, having the army around gives us something to threaten people with. It's always easier to use an old power structure on your behalf than to destroy the old structure and build a new one.  If we were backed by an army, pepole would do more of what we wanted because we could threaten them.  Now, why is it good to teach people political tactics?  Well, they're going to be used in later life.  Plus, political tactics can be analyized- so they have educational value like Literature- plus political tactics actually matter in the real world.  Also, it's a type of analysis we do too little of in college: strategic analysis.  We're really all going to be decisionmakers some day- why not teach us something related to decisionmaking?

      Joe talks about shooting down missiles with "laser beams", and asks about its applicability to nuclear physics/chemistry.  Well, lasers certainly are used in all branches of science from physics to medicine, but within the area of laser technology, MTHEL doesn't really have anything to do with what physicists or chemists are intersted in.  I did a back-of-the-envelope calculation, and have determined that a laser pulse that contains the energy of the daisy-cutter, equivalent to five tons of TNT, would have a momentum of about 67 kgm/s, which is about the same as the momentum that seven fastballs have, i.e., not much.  Recoil would be a non-existent problem, so maybe, if we can get a compact enough apparatus and energy source, these things *could* be mounted on planes.

      In response to Joe's post on the sin of scandal, I'd argue the following.   I think there's a basic ambiguity in the way that Larry defined the sin of scandal.  Depending on how you resolve the ambiguity, one of two things is true.  Either Larry and I are both right (regarding our respective points) or we are both wrong.  In any case, I'm not alone in error :).  Larry defines scandal as deliberately leading another person into a grave offense.  Joe argues that this doesn't prohibit dissent on important matters.   Joe argues that, if the dissenter doesn't believe that the act is a grave offense, it isn't scandal because the dissenter isn't deliberately leading someone into a grave offense.    The question is, what does it mean to deliberately lead someone else into a grave offense?  There are three potentially relevant questions of fact.  First, did person A deliberately advocate the act?  Second, did A believe that the act was grave offense?  Third, is the act, in the eyes of the church, a grave offense?  What happens in a case of honest belief, in which A advocated an act that A felt was ok but the church felt was a grave offense?  Would this be scandal in the eyes of the church?   Joe, in essence, argues that honest belief is a defense to scandal.  Larry disagrees.   For Larry's post to be right, honest belief cannot be a defense to scandal.  Larry argues that people who support abortion rights (feeling that it can be right to have an abortion, rather than feeling that it is simply someone else's call) or the death penalty should be denied communion because they are committing scandal.  They are advocating an act (abortion or the death penalty).  They don't feel that it's a grave offense.  The church does.  According to Larry, this is scandal in the eyes of the church.  Honest belief is no defense to scandal, according to Larry.  If Larry is right, so am I.  By Larry's analysis, if you advocate an act that I feel is a grave offense, I'd conclude that you're committing scandal even if you honestly believe that the act is ok.  Your honest belief that the act is ok is no defense to scandal.  I think you're wrong, so I think you're committing scandal.  If I think people who disagree with me are committing scandal, then all the tensions with a democratic mindset that I detail are present.  This is even more worrisome if there is an objective "truth" out there.  Lets say that there's a question about an important matter that has only two answers, each totally opposed to the other- like abortion perhaps.    If you and I disagree, one of us is committing scandal.  We may not know which, but whichever it is had better fess up before he dies, otherwise he's in hot water.    This seems to disincentivize all sorts of debate.  If the penalty for being wrong is committing a grave offense, you'd better keep your mouth shut.    Joe notes that there is debate in the church and argues that, because there is debate in the church, a debate stifling interpretation of scandal must not hold.   My response would go like this: If people in the church aren't committing scandal when they disagree over important matters, why are politicians?  It seems that if members of the church can express unorthodox opinions, so can politicians.    So, to take this all the way, either the church had better stop debating or it ought to allow everyone to take communion.  It can't have one standard for clergy and another for politicians (or if it can, I'd like to hear why).  But if honest belief is a defense against scandal (as Joe argues), Larry and I are both wrong.  If honest belief is a defense against scandal, then politicians advocating the death penalty or abortion rights aren't sinning and should be able to take communion.  Also, people who express opinions you disagree with aren't sinners so long as they honestly believe what they're saying.  Thus, there's no tension with a democratic mindset.  This would, however, dramatically circumscribe the meaning of scandal.  Now, pornography distributors who felt that porn was ok would have a perfect defense against scandal.    If the idea that honest belief is a defense against sin holds more generally, then it seems hard to have a religion of rules.  Every adherent would seem to be a pope onto himself- and all sorts of stuff would be righteous conduct.  What's worse, introspection would be penalized if you were only punished when you did something you felt was wrong.  Lets say I am engaging in an act that I currently feel is right.  If I never think about it, I'll be ok.  I can keep doing the act and I won't be punished.    But if I think about it, I risk concluding that it's wrong.  If I conclude that it's wrong, I'll either have to stop doing the act or face punishment.  If I never think about the morality of anything, then I'll never face this problem.  Therefore, I face an incentive to never think about morality, but to simply conclude that everything I'm doing is right.  How can a religion whose rules are supposed to encourage morality create an incentive to never think about it?  For a religion to encourage morality without stifling debate, perhaps it ought to hold people to a standard of effort: do your best and you're ok.  Feel free to fire back.

        urlLink This  is just too cool .  A lot of smart people disagree on missile defense.  The opportunity cost for heavy research into an effective system is way too high right now.  But  urlLink MTHEL ? A laser that can just shoot crap out of the sky?  How awesome is that?  There has to be some other practicial application for it to justify throwing tons of money at Northrop Grumman.  If we get it small enough (looks about the size of a large Winnebago now), maybe mounting them on planes?  How about in the sciences?

      Much like Mike, I don't pretend to know much about the particular theology of the sin of scandal.  I'll leave that up to Andrew and Inquisitor Larry to discuss further.  What I want to do is show why the meat and potatoes of Mike's problem with the sin aren't really problematic (according to Larry's explanation of the sin).  I'm not going to get into the merits of systems with a belief in objective truth.  Much like anything else, they can produce wonderful things (Mother Teresa) and horrible things (Auto de Fe).  Let's go back to Larry's definition of scandal:    An attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil. The person who gives scandal becomes his neighbor's tempter. He damages virtue and integrity; he may even draw his brother into spiritual death. Scandal is a grave offense if by deed or omission another is deliberately led into a grave offense.   Mike's concern: "This makes disagreement over some issues a sin, and it means that better reasoned disagreement is just that much more sinful."  His conclusion:    If the church does not believe that it can know God's mind perfectly, then it should encourage dissent. Indeed, the more harmful error is, the more the church should welcome debate because debate makes it more likely that the truth will emerge. If this argument holds, then the rational for condeming dissent as scandal would be undermined.   There's a big difference between dissent and advocacy of something you know is wrong.  Look at  Brandenburg : I can argue to a crowd that you should write your congressman saying that jaywalkers should be shot, but I can't rile up a gun-toting audience and say, "hey, here's a jaywalker - use your gun and shoot him!"  This setup just makes a lot of sense.  Democracy allows for flexibility in law and policy, and this type of dissent uses just that dynamism to effect change.  At the same time, it prevents charismatic nutjobs from unilaterally changing policy and bringing the masses along for the ride.  The same thing applies to the Church.  The definition of scandal requires some willful intent to lead someone down the wrong path.  I must "deliberately" convince someone to do a grave offense.  If I know that the Church condems heresy, and I think the Church  should  condemn heresy, and I still use all of my power to convince Bob that the Black Mass is A-OK, then I've committed scandal.    The line is a lot fuzzier when that willful intent to mislead isn't there.  I could well say, "the Church condemns abortion, but I still think it should be legal to make the choice for oneself."  Have I committed scandal?  Certainly not the grave kind.  I'm recognizing that the Church has a specific stance, I'm not misrepresenting that stance, and I'm not enticing anyone to run down to the local Planned Parenthood.  More to Mike's point, there is the ability to voice dissent in the Church.  However, much as we wouldn't want Cletus and Joe-Bob deregulating energy by themselves, we wouldn't want people who aren't versed in theology to try and figure out exactly what God means and wants.  Priests, cardinals, bishops (and yes, I would assume even the Pope) ask themselves, "why is this a sin?  why would God want His people to not do this?"  This type of self-reflection is perfectly OK, because it shows a desire to understand God's plan for our lives.  If I'm still confused, or if I come out opposed to a teaching, I've always got a priest I can go to who'll try to convince me of the other side.  But there's a huge difference between this (which lines up pretty well with democracy, albeit with a smidge of objective truth thrown into the mix) and simply advocating doing something you know (or suspect) to be sinful.

      A couple minor points on Mike's post:  Having well-reasoned arguments might make the scandal worse, but it doesn't imply that you're more  evil .  Being evil is different from committing a sin.  There's also a difference between knowing the mind of God perfectly and an infallible Church.  The latter just means that when the Church says something, it doesn't get it wrong.  There may be some things that the Church has to be silent on.  Perhaps a more interesting, from a political and philosophical point of view, is the juxtaposition of a couple lines from Mike's post.  Ecce:      ...if my arguments are really well reasoned, it's more likely that I'll persuade others. This makes     my sin more serious- yet it also makes it more likely that I'm right.   and      ...a well reasoned opponent helps me to ensure that my opinions are actually right by    challenging them.   So the more well-reasoned an argument is, the more likely it's right.  Also, the more well-reasoned an opposing argument is, the more likely the argument it opposes is right.  So what's the point of making well-reasoned arguments?  People just keep refining arguments ad infinitum even though the underlying truth remains the same.

      I have to say that I'm a bit disturbed by the sin of scandal.  I don't propose to evaluate it from a theological perspecitve, but the sin of scandal seems to exist in deep tension with basic democratic values.  As a sin, scandal means tempting others into sin.  As larry argues, this can mean advocating a position that is contradictory to the teachings of the church because that advocacy can tempt others into sin.  This makes disagreement over some issues a sin, and it means that better reasoned disagreement is just that much more sinful.  If I advocate the death penalty or abortion, I'm comitting scandal.  And if my arguments are really well reasoned, it's more likely that I'll persuade others.  This makes my sin more serious- yet it also makes it more likely that I'm right and it makes it more understandable that I hold the position that I do since I have good reasons for thinking so.  Someone who supports church orthodoxy, rather than respect me for my excellent reasoning, should therefore regard me as just that much more evil.  This mindset seems to exist in great tension with that we use in the political sphere in a democracy.  In a democracy, voicing an opinion is not punished and it isn't even ultimately viewed as a moral wrong even by those that disagree with the opinion being voiced.  Eloquent, well reasoned opponents are admired and respected- they add vibrancy to the debate and one can see the merit in their position.  In a democracy, part of the rational for welcoming debate rests on a measure of self doubt.  I'm not wholly sure what the truth is, even if I have strong views.  So a well reasoned opponent helps me to ensure that my opinions are actually right by challenging them.  As a result, as much as I disagree with him, I'm grateful for his voicing of his views.  It would seem that this argument for dissent because of self-doubt ought to apply to the theological realm as well.  Does the church really believe that it can know God's mind perfectly?  If the church does not believe that it can know God's mind perfectly, then it should encourage dissent.  Indeed, the more harmful error is, the more the church should welcome debate because debate makes it more likely that the truth will emerge.  If this argument holds, then the rational for condeming dissent as scandal would be undermined.  In a democracy, we also welcome dissent because of a sense that people have the right to speak (whether because of a natural right or because allowing venting increases happiness).  If you believe that people have the right to voice their views, can you square this with a theological perspective that condemns dissent on key issues as sinful and well reasoned dissent as even more sinful?

      Larry argues that granting communion to advocates of the death penalty is inconsistent with denying it to advocates of abortion.  But abortion and the death penalty aren't the only politically-important grave sins, waging an unjust war is another one that springs to mind.  So if the war in Iraq is/was unjust, then shouldn't its supporters also be denied communion?  Does the Church have an official position on whether this war is just?  And if it does, to what extent does being ignorant of the Church's position absolve a politician of scandal?  A related question is whether the Church  makes  a war just by declaring it so, or whether all wars are inherently just or unjust, and the Church just  discovers  the justness or unjustness of a war.  Is it scandal to advocate something that is a grave sin that the Church hasn't declare as such yet?

      I agree with Larry's post, and am not going to bother to nitpick to find little faults.  An interesting issue he raises is the mitigation of culpability by ignorance.  Suppose that the family of a murder victim wants the murder to be put to death, because their sense of justice is one that includes what the Church would call vengeance.  You could just say that the family doesn't know any better.  And a politician who advocates the death penalty on this basis might be similarly ignorant.  It seems that a way to avoid, or at least to minimize, committing scandal is just to not pay attention to the Church.  Another problem is the fact that receiving communion is a binary--you either get it or you don't--but the Church (or Larry, at least) will allow that culpability has gradations.  Just how culpable do you have to be to be denied communion?  I'm not a scholar of the Church, so maybe it's already clearly spelled this out.  Andrew, Larry, Joe, your thoughts?

      At a news conference last month, Cardinal Francis Arinze introduced a document,  Redemptionis Sacramentum , which is meant to standardize liturgical practice in the Catholic Church and end so-called "liturgical abuses." It can be found :  urlLink here   Perhaps the most controversial aspect of this document stemmed not from anything written in the text itself but to a statement that Cardinal Arinze made in response to a question over whether pro-choice Catholics such as presidential candidate John Kerry should be barred from receiving Communion. Cardinal Arinze deferred that question to the United States bishops but did say that if a Catholic politician were "unambiguously pro-choice," then he/she should not receive Communion. More generally,  Redemptionis Sacramentum  restates the Catholic doctrine that one conscious of grave sin should not receive Communion.  "The Church’s custom shows that it is necessary for each person to examine himself at depth, and that anyone who is conscious of grave sin should not celebrate or receive the Body of the Lord without prior sacramental confession, except for grave reason when the possibility of confession is lacking; in this case he will remember that he is bound by the obligation of making an act of perfect contrition, which includes the intention to confess as soon as possible”.  This is not new. The Church has always held to this convention and rightly so. The Body of Christ is such a sacred mystery and such an intimate  communion  with God that for it to enter a person who has voluntarily severed his/her relationship with God and continued to do so without making amends is nothing short of sacrilege. If you commited some grave transgression toward your friend, you would not dine at his house until you had apologized to him, would you? The same principle applies here: Reconciliation first, THEN Communion.   The questions that arise in this context are 1.) whether the support of abortion constitutes a grave sin and 2.) if it is, whether Communion should be denied to people who support other positions that the Church has explicitly denounced, such as the death penalty or contraception. With regard to the first question, the Catechism of the Catholic Church does state in no uncertain terms that:  "Scripture specifies the prohibition contained in the fifth commandment: "Do not slay the innocent and the righteous." The deliberate murder of an innocent person is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human being, to the golden rule, and to the holiness of the Creator. The law forbidding it is universally valid: it obliges each and everyone, always and everywhere."  I am strongly resisting the temptation to engage in an exegesis on whether the Catechism is correct with regard to abortion since this is the very heart of the abortion debate. Although I personally believe that abortion is wrong except in extremely morally ambiguous cases (such as when the life of the mother is at stake), I will accept that it is true for the sake of this essay since we cannot proceed to the next question without establishing a certain answer to the first.    What of the death penalty, then? The Catechism of the Catholic Church takes an interesting position on capital punishment. While it states that "bloodless means" are preferable if they are sufficient to punish a criminal, it makes accommodation for the death penalty, stating:   "Legitimate public authority has the right and duty to inflict penalties commensurate with the gravity of the crime. The primary scope of the penalty is to redress the disorder caused by the offense. When his punishment is voluntarily accepted by the offender, it takes on the value of expiation. Moreover, punishment, in addition to preserving public order and the safety of persons, has a medicinal scope: as far as possible it should contribute to the correction of the offender.   "The traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude, presupposing full ascertainment of the identity and responsibility of the offender, recourse to the death penalty, when this is the only practicable way to defend the lives of human beings effectively against the aggressor."   Still, this statement is qualified by the assertion that "given the means at the State's disposal to effectively repress crime by rendering inoffensive the one who has committed it, without depriving him definitively of the possibility of redeeming himself, cases of absolute necessity for suppression of the offender 'today ... are very rare, if not practically non-existent.'"   The key difference between the death penalty and abortion appears to be that of moral culpability. An unborn infant has no moral agency and thus cannot be presumed to be worthy of being voluntarily killed. A convicted serial killer with a high likelihood to reoffend, on the other hand, has a great deal of moral agency and, moreover, has used that agency to take innocent human lives, presenting himself to be a threat to the public. In this case, the death penalty could be seen as a measure of self-defense. Nevertheless, without getting into the finer points of the death penalty debate, the existence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in , say, a Supermax prison would make the support of the death penalty a rather dubious proposition if such support were to be predicated only upon the criteria of expiation for sins and the preservation of public safety. Rather, one of the major arguments for the death penalty has come from the families of victims, who contend that the death penalty is necessary for them to arrive at some kind of closure. However, the Catechism makes no mention of closure for the victims. Rather, if closure for the victims' families is the only criterion for the use of the death penalty, then the argument could be made that we begin to walk the fine line between justice and vengeance. The former is permissible in Church doctrine; the latter is not. Preposterous as it may sound to the family of a child who is abducted, raped and murdered by a serial killer, the Church would most likely ask them to seek healing through prayer and forgiveness. "Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you," said Jesus during the Sermon on the Mount.   As an intermediate conclusion, we can say that support for the death penalty is not sin if it is advocated in the context of protecting the public or helping the sinner (assuming that he/she has not been wrongly convicted). However, if support for the death penalty is borne out of vengeance, then it cannot be morally justifiable. Moreover, since appropriate alternatives that allow criminals to remain alive while satisfying the first two conditions exist, the death penalty has become increasingly indefensible. Does it follow, then, that the advocacy of the death penalty constitutes a grave sin? To understand this, we need to examine the Church's concept of scandal.   Scandal, as defined by the Catechism, is "an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil. The person who gives scandal becomes his neighbor's tempter. He damages virtue and integrity; he may even draw his brother into spiritual death. Scandal is a grave offense if by deed or omission another is deliberately led into a grave offense." Thus, the advocacy of a sin is in itself a grave sin. Teachers, parents and even entire social structures can be guilty of scandal if the rules and teachings they espouse are contrary to morality. Following this logic, advocates of euthanasia are guilty of scandal. Drug pushers are guilty of scandal. Peddlers of pornography are guilty of scandal. Since scandal is defined as a grave offense, it severs one's relationship with God and the Church and prohibits one from receiving Communion  latae sententiae , by the very commission of the offense.   The question, then, is whether advocacy of the death penalty is also a sin of scandal. For scandal to be committed, the usual requirements for an action (or omission) to be sin must also be present. The Catechism states that man is a moral agent because of his state of freedom and that the morality of an action is determined by three criteria: 1.) the object chosen; 2.) the end in view or intention; 3.) the circumstances of the action.  First, the person must be committing a morally evil act. Second, the person must know that it is evil. Third, the person must have free will to choose to commit the evil act. It matters not if the ends are good or if the means are good. For an action to be evil, only one of those two components (means or ends) must be evil. For instance, prayer, even though it is a good thing, can be twisted to evil ends if done in a profane way. By the same token, the use of torture in interrogation is not permissible even if it results in information that could save lives. The end may be good, but the means are not.   The death penalty issue represents a moral quagmire for people. The Catechism states that circumstances "contribute to increasing or diminishing the moral goodness or evil of human acts" or the responsibility of the moral agent, but "they cannot change the moral quality of acts themselves; they can make neither good nor right an action that is in itself evil." There may indeed be people who, out of ignorance, continue to believe that the death penalty really is the safest way to prevent crime. This reduces moral culpability to an extent but no one can deny that the taking of a life is evil. Thus, the end may be good but the means are undeniably bad. There is no way around this problem. Killing is killing. Granted, it is not the taking of an innocent life, but then again, Jesus's admonition to the Pharisees to let the sinless one cast the first stone against the adulterous woman stands as a reminder that to punish guilt by death can be a hypocritical act since none of us are blameless. Since the death penalty involves the use of morally evil means to achieve a morally good end, it is a morally evil act. Since scandal involves the advocacy of a morally evil act, those who promote the death penalty are also committing a sin of scandal, although moral responsibility can be diminished by ignorance. Those who advocate the death penalty out of vengeance and hatred for criminals are unambiguously committing a sin of scandal because not only are the means evil but so is the stated end. Since scandal is a grave sin, the logical extension is that the Church should deny Communion to pro-death penalty advocates.

      Two points in defense (somewhat) of two Clintons in relation to Joe´s Sunday post:  In hindsight, everyone agrees that Bill Clinton should have had a more vigorous response to the U.S.S. Cole attack, but terrorism was a much lower-profile issue back in the 90s.  There was enough Clinton hatred among Republicans that they´d jump to attack him for just about anything, so there´s no reason to believe that many people on either side of the aisle were as serious about terrorism as everyone is today.  The point of which is, that we probably wouldn´t have gotten anything substantially different had Dole been elected in ´96, so any criticism of Clinton´s terrorism policies should be kept in perspective.  While I´ll agree that Hillary Clinton´s comments likely gave a (small) boost to the insurgents´ morale, we have to ask the question, "how else are we going to get the Bush Administration to engage in the sort of dialogue that Abu Aardvark and Joe agree is necessary?"  This question is a lot like the one we faced in Vietnam, where criticism of the war at home strengthened the Viet Cong´s resolve, but it also advanced a greater goal, getting out.  In this case, the greater goal is getting the administration to pay more attention to winning the hearts and minds of Arabs.  I don´t have an answer for what sort of pressure is both realistic and effective, but we should be careful about what we want to encourage and what we want to discourage here.

      Two blogs that I tend to read pretty often are  urlLink The Volokh Conspiracy  and  urlLink Abu Aardvark .  It's not often that they deal with the same subject matter, but  urlLink this recent post  by Eugene Volokh prompted a  urlLink really interesting response  from the Aardvark.  I read both posts a few times, and I don't think there's much they *really* disagree about.  The controversy stems from remarks made by Sen. Hilary Clinton to a British-based Arabic newspaper, al Sharq al Awsat, calling the Bush administration  urlLink "stubborn and arrogant"  in its dealings in Iraq, and with the Arab world in general.  Eugene's response:   Seems to me that the very likely effect of statements such as this is to magnify the resolve of those who are trying to defeat us, to kill our soldiers, and to take over Iraq (despite the line about "could not abandon Iraq," which many Iraqis would assume could change if America's "trouble" only got big enough). It is especially likely to magnify their resolve to keep fighting until the election, rather than to surrender and be seen as giving Bush a victory. And the standard (and often quite persuasive) justification for such criticism even during wartime, which is that Americans need to hear all the arguments to decide whom to vote for, is at its least forceful with a statement such as this one.    Abu's rejoinder:   To the contrary, we need far more American politicians talking directly to the Arab media, not less. There is a (somewhat) healthy debate going on in this country about issues of real importance. Arabs know these debates are going on, whether or not Hilary gives an interview to al Sharq al Awsat, and do their best to follow these debates - which affect them directly and massively. Instead of forcing them to read tea leaves, we should be doing everything we can to show Arabs the terms of that debate, explain our reasoning, and show how a healthy democracy airs its differences. It has been a major, major shortcoming of the Bush administration that it has come to shun the Arab media and treat it like an enemy. If we don't define ourselves - to swipe the line about Kerry - then others will define us. And that would be a shame.    Um, OK.  Both statements are factually correct.  The effect of Hilary's statement will probably be to steel Iraqi opposition groups.  Even if they're not as advanced as al-Qaeda, I'll be a monkey's uncle if they're not thinking as strategically as al-Qaeda (I'm looking at you, Spain...).  But I really doubt the libertarian Volokh would disapprove of the Aardvark's suggestion that the administration engage in more open debate in the Arab media.  Wouldn't be that hard.  Let Powell drop a few sound bites, or have him pen an op-ed response to Hilary in the same Arabic newspaper.  If they still love al-Hurra that much, they can play it up there - "America deals with local media - catch it here next!"    The other big part of the controversy is that it's a statement  from Hilary Clinton .  The left side of the blogosphere (like the Aardvark) sneers whenever anyone else mentions her name - "but she's not running for president!"  True.  But she is a major player simply because of her name.  Teddy Kennedy isn't running for President, but he's certainly got enough name rec to make a splash (no pun intended) whenever he speaks.  So yes, the fact that it came from Hilary  is  important - the Clinton name might remind radicals of the good ole days when they could ram small seacraft into large American ships with impunity.

                        Iraq and Vietnam     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I seem to be on a history kick, here's a  discussion between several historians addressing the question: Can we compare  Iraq to Vietnam?&nbsp; The discussion comes from the  History News Network .&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, they're all skeptical about drawing too many  parallels between Vietnam and Iraq.&nbsp; In comparing and contrasting the two  situations, they reach some optimistic conclusions and some pessimistic  ones.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the optimistic side, Iraqi insurgents have less  outside support than did the Viet Cong.&nbsp; The VC were supported by the North  Vietnamese Army as well as China and Russia.&nbsp; In Iraq, there may be outside  jihadists, but their numbers are probably limited and they can't provide same  logistical support that was provided to the VC. &nbsp;Iraq&nbsp;doesn't have the  difficult jungle terrain of Vietnam.&nbsp; As a result, it's not quite so easy  for insurgents to hide, at least in theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Iraqi  insurgency is less well organized than was the VC.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the pessimistic side, in Iraq we have&nbsp;no  real&nbsp;indigenous&nbsp;state with which to cooperate.&nbsp; In South Vietnam,  at least there was a bureaucracy and an army that was at least moderately  functional and interested in it's own survival.&nbsp; In Iraq, only Bush  Administration PR personnel are willing to say&nbsp;that&nbsp;indigenous state  is going to add much to our concrete capabilities anytime soon.&nbsp; Also, in  Iraq, we have&nbsp;a much lower ratio of troops to the&nbsp;indigenous  population than we did in Vietnam.&nbsp; Lastly, there's a disturbing similarity  in that we're likely to have friction with the indigenous state that does  emerge.&nbsp; In Vietnam, we were hamstrung by the fact that the indigenous  government often desired different, more accommodationist war aims than we  did.&nbsp; In Iraq, popularity for Iraqi politicians may depend on their opening  up distance between themselves and the U.S. occupation.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me know what you think.

                      A Few Thoughts About Reagan     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reagan's death has touched off lots of commentary  on some of my favorite blogs.&nbsp;  Matt  Ellis &nbsp;recently argued, among other things, that Reagan's simplicity,  charm and old-time patriotism struck a nerve with an electorate that was tired  out by the chaos of the sixties and the seventies.&nbsp; He argues that this  electorate simply didn't look at Reagan closely and that this laziness on the  part of the electorate is to be blamed for Reagan's rise.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I think there's a lot of truth to this, I think  it's important to note that the Democratic Party bears much&nbsp;blame for  Reagan's rise.&nbsp; Democrats, after all, got us stuck in Vietnam and then the  left of the party created the social unrest that made people yearn for a simpler  time and simpler folks like Reagan.&nbsp; We also fielded weak candidates like  Carter and Mondale.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the social forces underlying our coalition were  breaking apart.&nbsp; The South was ready to leave the party.&nbsp; The civil  war was distant enough and the sixties and the civil rights  movement&nbsp;highlighted the gap on social views between Northern Democrats and  the South.&nbsp; Moreover, many Midwesterners were alienated by the same social  issues and, with Carter's failure on the economic front, Democrats couldn't as  easily claim to be the best party for the workingman.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the shift to a political environment that emphasized  coalition-splitting social issues was also partly a choice.&nbsp; The women's  movement wanted to go all out on abortion and the equal rights amendment.&nbsp;  Environmentalists, gun control advocates and death penalty opponents&nbsp;were  getting new salience for their issues as well.&nbsp; These choices by Democratic  pressure groups contributed to the shifting political atmosphere and&nbsp;did us  no favor at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinton's victories in the 90s weren't simply a result  of Bush's failure.&nbsp; Clinton understood the roots of the party's  problems.&nbsp; He took a middle tack on social issues, flying home to Arkansas  to sign the death warrant of a retarded killer, promising to make abortion  "safe, legal and rare" and to "end welfare as we know it".&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also struck a skillful note on economic issues.&nbsp;  He allayed the concerns of the country club set that the party would break the  bank by promising to be fiscally responsible.&nbsp; And his promises of an  undefined health care plan were vague enough to not create budget worries but  salient enough to touch a key nerve with the working class that feared for their  health insurance.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Reagan can't be blamed merely on the American  electorate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Democrats were complicit in his rise.&nbsp; And Clinton's  defeat of the Republican machine wasn't pure&nbsp;happenstance.&nbsp; It was  strategy.

        I thought I'd recommend a whiskey and two interesting economics articles.  I recommend enjoying them together, but they also work separately : ).    The whiskey is Tomatin 12- it's a lighter whiskey with a sweet, spicy flavor and a long warm finish.  It's quite solid- not a classic, but very much worth trying.  For the malt lovers out there, it's more like Macallan than Bowmore.    And now for the economics articles.  Both are old Economist articles and together, I think they support the belief that our capitalist system is doing a good job generating broad based wealth, but that constructive steps need to be taken to alleviate the very real poverty that still remains.  This is the sort of synthesis that pro-market Democrats like me are fond of.    First off, an optimistic view of the U.S. economy here http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2501977    And second, some steps we might take to combat poverty here http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=308998    Enjoy!  And be sure to start reading before you start drinking.  Otherwise, things might get a little blurry before the end.

      There are a number of interesting linguistic questions raised in the last two posts.  Mike essentially proposes the Sorites paradox (when does a small pile of sand become a "heap" of sand vs. when does some agglomeration of molecules and energy produce a mind), and then says that since we can't define these terms with precision, the line of reasoning should be rejected.  Jason responds that we function perfectly well with degrees of vagueness all the time, in professions that usually require a high degree of specificity, and that we don't need to determine the exact point when a mind comes into existence to reasonably test if what we know as a mind does exist at some time t.    If we really take Mike's argument to a logical conclusion, we're left with being unable to precisely define anything.  Let's try to define "ball."  Well, it can be a party, as in a "gala ball."  Which is different than a "formal ball."  It could also mean "a round object we play games with."  But is it for basketball?  Baseball?  An oblong football?  The word "ball" generally signifies a group of possible definitions, but we need some greater context to just nail down which definition is operative.  Even if I say, "I want a basketball," there are many different kinds of basketballs - different colors, different textures, etc.  But even with this vagueness, nobody would object to a witness at trial testifying "I saw three males playing with a basketball in the yard across the street."    Though we have trouble even defining terms to precisely describe physical objects, Jason is right to point out that we have even greater difficulty with abstract concepts.  You can't hold a mind, so how do we know it exists?  We construct a definition that says "if something displays these characteristics, like certain brainwave patterns or the physiological capacity to reason, we can call it a mind."  It's a catch-all definition, not exhaustive, but it at least gets us started.  Utility falls under the same category: if it's the greatest good for the greatest number (with the usual caveats), what's "good"?  Does good mean pleasurable?  Following some ethical code that itself rests on vague terms?  No clue, but we use good as a term every day without too much confusion.  Saying that it's purely subjective doesn't help much, either, since it either means (a) that we can't create any truly "just" rules since we'll always run the risk of offending someone who changes their mind, or (b)admits that there is an intuitive, nonprecise definition of good that works well enough.

      Re: Mike's response to my post about abortion.  First, let us assume some version of physicalism, i.e., that the mind is a physical thing or emerges from purely physical things.  In this case, Mike argues that since the chemical and electrical activity that is cause of a mind must precede the formation of the actual mind, there's a gap between when brainwaves, a presumptive effect of this chemical and electrical activity, and when the mind, another presumptive effect of this activity, begin.  Well, no.  They're both effects of the same cause; one is not the cause of the other, so neither is logically bound to precede the other.  When I turn on a old light, produces a buzz and illumination at the same time.  Or close enough to the same time.  As far as I know, distinctly human brainwaves more or less appear all at once, on a about the same timescale as an abortion operation.   Most of Mike's problem with my proposal of the appearance of distinctly human brainwaves is that I can't prove that they're a proxy for a mind.  He wants a definition of a mind, and a way we can test for it.  I'd like to continue to assume a physicalism here, because requiring something other than the brain to produce the mind I don't think will lead to fruitful discussion without bringing theology in.  There are many abstract concepts, like "a mind", that defy a facile definition yet are still useful in psychology, ethics, and the law.  Take for example  willingness .  How do you prove the existence of willingness?  Well, we don't have direct access to someone's volition, so instead we rely on outward signs.  We look for things that always manifest themselves when a person is willing, and don't manifest themselves when a person is unwilling.  Rape is having sexual intercourse with someone against their will.  How do we determine whether the accuser was willing or not?  We can't get direct access to her mind, so we look at things like whether she fought, whether she cried out, etc.  We accept that reports of the accuser shouting, "help me, I'm being raped", implies that she is not willing that the intercourse take place.  Outward behavioral signs are accepted as describing interior mental states.  It's hard to have a functioning society without this assumption.  So to determine what is a good test for a mind, we look for things that always appear when there is a human mind, and for things that never appear when there isn't a human mind.  We don't have to be able to exhaustively describe the precise chain of causation, just as we don't have to be able to describe how the mental state of unwillingness to have sex leads to crying out or biting or clawing.  The only thing we've got that nicely correlates with a human mind is human brainwave activity.  Nothing that isn't it has it, and everything that  is  it has it.   And if you still want me to give you a definition of a human mind before we base any law upon it, please furnish definitons for "reasonable" and "willing", words that are important to all sorts of law.  My point here is that I can't give you as precise a definition as I think you want, and that the demand you make is too strong to be applied to all the terms we use in law and ethics.

      Jason argues that the presence of human brainwaves is sufficient to make a fetus alive and that, since these brainwaves are first present at 25 weeks, that's when life begins.  Jason argues this because the presence of human brainwaves signifies the presence of a human mind and human mind = human life.  On the flip side, no brainwaves = no human mind, and therefore no human life.    As a generally destructive fellow, I'm going to argue that there's no good way to define what a human mind is or to know when it exists so we shouldn't use it as a definition for when life begins.    Jason argues that human brainwaves prove the presence of a human mind.  There are two ways this could be true.  Either brainwaves could constitute a human mind or they could signify the presence of something deeper that we'd call a human mind.    Plainly, brainwaves alone do not constitute a human mind.  When we think of a human mind, we're not thinking of something that emits a particular pattern of electromagnetic radiation.  There are probably ways to duplicate the pattern of electromagnetic radiation that a mind emits: the mere emittion of the radiation isn't the mind.  When we think of a mind, we're thinking of a sort of conscoiusness, but we'd have a hard time saying much more than that.  That problem of definition one reason that we can't prove that brainwaves signify a human mind.  Proving that brainwaves are a sufficient sign of a human mind would require us to determine what a human mind is and have a test for the mind itself.  Then we'd have to show that minds and brainwaves always appear together.  So what is a human mind and how do we test for it?  I don't have answers to either of these questions and I don't see how anyone could.  Even if someone could define a mind, they'd have to be able to test for it and I can't see how you could test a fetus for a mind.  And if we could test for mind itself, we wouldn't need to look at brainwaves at all.  Brainwaves clearly are the product of certain chemical reactions in the brain.  But are these chemical reactions the sum total of mind?  Or are they mental operations that create mind?  How would we know if we can't even pin down what a mind is?  If the chemical reactions that produce brainwaves are the cause of mind rather than mind itself, then these chemical reactions exist before the mind because the cause must preceed the effect.  Brainwaves are therefore also prior to mind and exist when there is no mind.  How long is the gap between brainwaves and mind?  Beats me.  Why does this invalidate brainwaves as a test for life?  The case for brainwaves as a test relied on it's precision, but that precision doesn't exist because we're not sure what a human mind is, when it exists or that brainwaves are a sign of a human mind.  I offer all this in support of my general thesis that there is no valid and precise definition of human life, so the morality of abortion has to be determined on other grounds.  More on that later.

      Brief follow-up to the previous post:  Of course, sometimes murder is acceptable, even moral.  Self-defense, etc.  So abortion after the fetus shows human brain-waves might still be acceptable, but we then have to judge it by the same criteria we use to determine whether killing a born human is acceptable.

      My friend  urlLink heef  has a  urlLink post  about why partial-birth abortion (PBA) is immoral.  His position, in a nutshell, is that the line between acceptable abortion and unacceptable abortion has to lie somewhere between conception and birth, and that beyond birth, killing is wrong, and before conception, killing (or failure to beging a life) is permissable.  On this we pretty much all agree (except for Kant, who thought that since infants weren't part of the moral community, killing them would be O.K.).  He then argues that the only difference between PBA and infanticide is that in the former, the baby isn't fully out of the mother yet, and that trying to fit a moral distinction into that difference is unjustifiable:   This is the sickest of technicalities; yet people are using it as an excuse. "Yeah, it was still inside. Good thing it didn't move another 12 inches... then it would have been human!" It is a childish argument that has never held water, and it should be rejected by proponents and opponents of abortion alike.  He has a point, but this of course leave open the question, "when does a fetus become a human"?  A caveat before I try to address this question: I don't think many people on either side of the abortion debate seriously think about this question.  You hear knee-jerk answers, "at birth", and, "at conception", but both of these are, in my view, clearly silly.  People decide whether they want to allow abortion or not, and then decide when humanity begins to rationalize their position.  Both extreme positions are meritless.  First let's take the "being human begins at birth" position.  A fetus a day before birth differs from a fetus upon birth in terms of location.  So does where you are make you a human or not?  If for whatever reason, a baby were reinserted into the mother, would it cease to become human?  Proponents of humanity-begins-at-birth would say that it is the act of being born, not the present location, though then they are simply defining themselves to be right.  They have to argue that there is something inherent to the birthing process that makes a fetus into a human.  One candidate would be dependence on the mother to survive.  But newborns are dependent on the mother, and on the medical staff in her service, before and after the birth.  And moreover, plenty of humans, the sick, the very young, the very old, are dependent on others to survive, and they are no less human than the rest of us.  Another would be societal acceptance of being human.  While this is somewhat a case of begging the question, I'll ignore that objection for now.  The very fact that three-fourths of Americans are against PBA, and that mothers address their not-yet-born babies by name, sing to them, etc. indicates that we generally treat full-term pregnancies as people.  Moreover, in languages such as Spanish that make gramatical distinctions between persons and non-persons, mothers refer to their fetuses as persons.  Really the only area we treat full-term pregnancies as not being people is the law, and unless we're willing to say that being human is a legal construction instead of a social, spiritual, or biological construction then we shouldn't pay much attention to what the law might imply on this matter.   So if birth isn't a good place to draw the line, how about conception?   urlLink Kevin Drum , formerly Calpundit, puts it well:   ...[T]he idea that a few strands of DNA surrounded by a bit of protective packaging is equivalent to a human life is actually profoundly degrading to the idea of humanity. It's the most reductionist, materialistic view possible of what it means to be human.  What is the difference between a sperm cell about to fuse its DNA with an egg cell and a sperm cell that has already fused its DNA with that of an egg cell?  If the difference is humanity, then that means that being human means being diploid.  Before dismissing this out of hand, let's run with it for a while.  Okay, so you're a human if you've got two copies each of 26 chromosomes.  So then is any somatic cell a human?  Assuming we're not shedding little humans when we touch something rough, then let's say that these diploid cells have to be able to turn into an actual fetus.  This is what fundamentalist anti-abortionists believe, and thus they oppose stem cell research (but not IV fertilization, oddly enough...).  So then, suppose you have a person in the womb, and the blastula splits, producing what might become identical twins.  Why do we now have two people instead of one person?  Because they could turn into *two* fetuses.  But the unsplit blastula could turn into two fetuses as well.  It becomes a lot more likely once the blastula splits, but we're not talking likelihood--we're talking possibility.  After all, half of all conceptions result in spontaneous abortions, so if you want to make being human an issue of likelihood of being born alive, then you've got to put the bar down at least to 50% chance.  I hope I don't have to argue why we shouldn't say that being a human means something like being "one or more diploid cells that have a 34.5% or greater chance of being born alive".  So if a fertilized egg is one person, it's also two persons, and all the way up to however many identical n-tuplets is possible.  This doesn't just make the morning-after pill murder, it makes it multiple-homicide.  In fact, if being human begins at conception, and abortion is morally equivalent to murder, then taking the morning-after pill is  worse  than PBA.  You can believe this, but nobody does.  Being human doesn't start at conception, and being human doesn't start at birth.  So where?  One problem with this enterprise is that it's reducing humanness to one particular thing.  If you're not willing to say that being a human being begins at one particular point, such as having a heartbeat or having differentiated brain tissue, then you have to concede that a fetus gradually becomes more and more human until the third trimester.  You might also have to concede (depending on where you put the markers for progress toward humanhood) that some incapacitated people (those in a coma, for example) aren't fully human.  So let's see if we're fortunate enough to have some particular development in a fetus that is shared by all living humans, but not by other animals.  Things like a heartbeat, or subjective "human appearance" aren't going to cut it, because plenty of people have artificial hearts or are so disfigured as to not fit our ideas of what human appearance is.  The only suitable thing I can come up with is a pattern of brain-waves that is distinctly human (to be fair, I heard somebody mention this, that fetuses develop these brain-waves well before birth but after being just an embryo, several years ago, but I didn't think about it as relating to questions of abortion until recently).  This is very quantifiable.  There is an empty gulf between what human brain-waves look like and what ape or chimp brain-waves look like.  These brain-waves mark the birth of a human mind.   Human brain-waves appear around the 25th week.  Before then, abortion kills the potential of a human mind, no small loss, but not murder.  Thereafter, it kills a human mind, and accordingly, is murder.

      As a follow-up to Joe's advertisement for Bubba Hotep, I wish to say that Joe's endorsement, while technically accurate, is misleading.  Bubba Hotep is a concept film.  It's merit lies not necessarily in the execution, but in the premise and plot.  In fact, there are times when it is slow.  It's one to watch with friends and, preferably, alcohol.  My next post will be on abortion.

       urlLink Tom Friedman, please come home . Now I know we've had our fights in the past, but baby, I'll treat you right from now on. Tell me all about how reducing overall dependence on oil will promote social change in the Middle East. Whisper those sweet nothings of Lexuses and Olive Trees in my ear. I don't need to hear any more jibba-jabba about feminism being the one-stop solution in the fight against radical, violent Islam.  Come home.
