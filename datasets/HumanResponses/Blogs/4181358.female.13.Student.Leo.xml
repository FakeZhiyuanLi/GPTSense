       Today I got back from camp and Im leaving for Basketball camp in Iowa! Last year was soo much fun! we were riding up an down the elevator, drinking Red Bull and even spying on the counselors having stemy makeouts with boys! HAHA      Im so excited cause my cousin's going with me. I rarely ever see her cause she lives in Missouri! Im really bored right now though. Im all packed :) Something that rarely ever happens.      CAMP at PHANTOM was a blast! Teddy and I were friends and Swimming Buddy Partners. Now thats a match made in Heaven. Everybody kept laughing at Maddie. She's so perverted. She changes in front of us  ON PURPOSE!  What kind of pervert does that. Everybody was talking about not wearing a bra and how its so disgusting thatyou can see other people  through  and Maddie comes down from her bunk and is like I CANT BELIEVE I FORGOT TO PUT MY BRA ON! Ew. and as always she changed in front of us. Anyways. Maddie came up to us and is like "keep in touch" everybody.... you know what that means right? Everyone was so grossed out! All my GIRLS I LOVE YA! AND REMEMBER BECCA STINKS!      ~Rachel      Mood: Hyper (really hyper)      Song: Hey Ya!  Outkast

         So today i got up really depresssed because I haven't even started packing for camp yet and we're leaving today. I bet you I'm gonna forget  everything  cause I suck at that kinda stuff!   I really hope my friends in my cabin and not have all those creepy people who need special attention ( if ya know what I mean ) So now My mom's yelling at me to get off the computer so I can go pack. She's being a bit of a narcotic right now and its starting to piss me off. So I have to go and finish packing.... You probably won't be hearing from me in awhile :(       ~Rachel
