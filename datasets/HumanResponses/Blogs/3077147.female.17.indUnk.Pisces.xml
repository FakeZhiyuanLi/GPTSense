      please.. let me write some more in this blog to tell you about my oh-so-interesting life. i could run through the bathroom and get rachel's diary out from between her matresses on the left side of the bed if you were facing the window and tell you about her life instead. But she'd get upset if she knew i knew where it was. Which i don't. So have you ever looked @ a bubble? I mean really looked at one. To the point that you thought  hey i'd like to get in there..  well i haven't. but yo i'll put it on my to-do list. So i have a rough draft in english due friday along with a final report in espanol. I have a chemistry home work sheet due tomorrow and a geometry pre-test to do, even though i've already taken the test. How much sense does that make. And go on.. ask me how much of that i have done. Why no go ahead and ask me how much of it i've even started? You would think with all this free time on my hands i would have time for my homework but between eating and napping and tv and talking to my wonderful sister on the www.. and then the just plain sitting.. time gets away from me.. and my homework just kind of sits there. Maybe that's why it haunts me at 5 am. But i'll get it done. I aint skurred. I always end up getting it done and its always okay. And you would think with me being the totally rad girl that i am that i would have something better to write about.. guess again..... or you could think about it this way: maybe i DO have wicked awesome stuff to write about.. but maybe it's just stuff that the whole world doesn't need to have access to.. there's food for thought. so we have this dog named maggie.. she poops a lot and pees all over the place and mom get real upset.. dad loves her and takes naps with her and i think he loves her more than he does my mother.. and mom gets real upset.. and this dog happens to be the dog that i begged for for years upon years and promised repeatedly that i'd take care of.. and i dont.. and mom gets real upset. having said that i suppose i'll tend to my duties as an 11th grade student and go stare at my huck finn book.. u know how it is.

      So i wake up at like 5 in the morning.. and i can't go back to sleep, so i think hey.. why not do some homework? then i used my better judgement and went back to sleep. and then the usual routine goes about with mother beckoning at my door at 7 am when she knows good and well that i never roll out of bed until about 7:20.. so yada yada i get up, get dressed, eat some apple cinnomin (spelling?) oatmeal and go to school. nothing interesting happened today except i ate a hot dog for lunch. my friend Alise is coming over to go to church with me tonight so she can meet this boy that goes there. I'd hate to embarrass her so i'll give him the code name of Lucas Womacus. Which is really his name except for the last 'us'. And so the story goes. Yeah.. but uh.. word to tha roomdawgs since you are the only cool girls that read this :D

Just kidding! :D okay but i did rip my toenail off today, well not really off but it kinda got bent back and it didn't feel too good. here's the story since in know you're all so interested. so i was walking behing this guy and i kicked his heel accidently. yeah it happens. and that's all the news for today. holler.

      I hate school. All highschool is is busy work. You learn to read write and draw pretty rainbows in the third grade.. so buy you a calculator and you're set for life. I tested this reasoning on mother-bear but she wouldn't have it. Things got a little crunk and disorderly up in this muther. I stayed with hailey last night. We stayed up til 2:30 and tried to re-hook her up with her former boo cause we're just BA's like that. Fer real tho. I think we made quite a bit of progress. Aw snap. If there's one thing i've learned from watching other people's relationships (because i HAVE had so many of my own)... it's just that guys are idiots. I dont know why i've developed such a strong hatred towards the average male specimen. But i have so get over it. I'm sure it's just a passing phase. It'll be over by tomorrow around 8 or 9 cause hailey's comin over and so is her ex boo and my former/potential boo. And lemma tell ya... thangs are gonna get a lil crunk and disorderly up in this muther! I think rach will be coming home. I hope she doesnt wanna chill with us. that would make things orderly and uncrunk. And with having said that, i'm gonna go because i needa straightin my hurr b-fo full hizouse cums on. Life is ghetto fabolous. Because when my mom came to tell me goodnight tonite.. she said "nite dirty"... and i swear she did. And that makes me want to inflict large amounts of phsyical pain upon my dog. Whom i got in trouble for kicking today. whatever.

      My internet's been messed up so i haven't "blogged it" lately.. haven't had a lot to say anyway. mainly because i hate guys.. i guess it's because i have this thing about people lying to me.. call me crazy but i don't like it. But everything usually works out (usually) and stuff happens but it all comes together in the end. no worries. i'm going to the prom with robby trammel. that's who i escorted on homecoming court. my sis is coming home from college soon. maybe she'll fight with me, maybe she wont. this is the moment of truth. i dont know where i come up with this senseless babble. for those of you that are wondering, reguardless of all my pointless attempts to cease the life of maggie, she lives. Long live the dog. hooty hoo. whatever. and that's all i have to say about that. besides the fact that i made a D in espanol. i guess i should have done that report.....i'm thinking of taking up yoga as a hobby. my soul could use a little clensing. holler.

      so my sis got all emotional in here blooger today and it put me in a blogging mood. hailey stayed with me last night so that we could do our homework together, and we watched texas chainsaw and baked a chocolate cake. and no, the icing does not come in the box (thanks rach).. and there was actually a point that we did consider doing our homework.. but it was a long walk out to the car. and there's just no sense in walking out there to get it just to come inside and look at it. i dont care a whole lot for my dog maggie. dad really likes her and wont let me lock her outside for a long time. he wont let me feed her chocolate either.. so i just slip her some pizza rolls here and there. get her good and fat for the next dog eating buzzard that flies by. sometimes i really miss my sister. then there are times that she tells me she doesn't want to fight with be but yells at me for "getting smart" when i look at her the wrong way. talk about a weirdo.. ok so maybe i didn't have as much to say today as i thought. i miss will. William Burley Cooley. that used to chill @ da crib wen RaCh*bAbY was his boo. that's over and done with. GO TWC BASEBALL! AND MCMINN SOCCER <<(for betC) tomorrow i wont go to school. i'm gonna roll to chat town to hang wit da room*dawgs. Actually i'll go to the doctor and let mom drag me around the mall for hours upon hours (im not a big shopper).. but i gotta have prom shoes i suppose. IM GONNA MISS MY ROOMDAWGS THOUGH :'( YOU GUYS CAN COME STAY W/ ME WHENEVER YOU WANT TO! and that's all i have to say about that.

      Well Rach is home for good now. I've tried to shew her off by telling the rents she's old enough to chill in GA w/ her long awaited true love, but Heaven forbid she make her own decisions seeing as how she's only a young responsible adult. My mother wanted to ground me because i got a sunburn. I just had to tell her like it is. I don't think she likes me much anymore. It's summer vacation. And summer just puts me in a good mood. Because i sit at home and do absolutely nothing, and that's just how i like it. Except for next wednesday when i start a babysitting job. But never fear, the "master" has come up with a "master" plan. These kids are old enough to basically take care of themselves. Like they can make their own lunches and stuff. And i'm in charge. That makes me the boss. So while they're "making their own lunches" they can make mine too. I'll just sit around and watch tv and talk on the phone and get paid for it. Life is good. Party hard or don't bother. westside.

      Yeah it's been a while... hard to fine time to get around to blogging these days.. i do a lot of homework, being the straight A student that i am.. if you disreguard the F in chemistry, D in spanish and C's in everything but art. But hey, it's all to tha goodie. I'm still in honor's lunch. So did you all hear about nikki puking at prom? I just thought i'd clue you in since blogs are aparently the gossip capital of the world wide web. I don't really have much else to say.. no new news. Just kinda bored and stuff.. cause you know how it goes. Holler.

      Does anyone else think it's funny that every time Ali laughs hard she pees on herself? I dunno.. something about that fact just amuses me. And i love it when i'm trying to drive to church, and old men pull up beside me in the median telling me i'm going to kill someone and i need to slow down and that he's going to "contact my parents" because he has my tag number and he's NOT from Indiana, he's from here. And i did care about that fact i swear. Yeah whatever. It was cute, really it was. Something about people that DONT have authority over me yet seemingly think they do... yeah i don't handle situations like that well. Not to mention the fact that he told me he was going to call the police if i didn't roll down the window, yet if the po po came, they would find him pulled up beside me in the median. Yay. Go old people. I swear. Poor Leeann (em's little sister) was in the back seat and couldn't figure out why the old dude was yelling at her favorite person ever.. And she totally farted SO LOUD in church while she was sitting in Emilee's lap, and we DIED laughing right in the middle of it. There's something about being in church that magnifies the humor even in small things. I'm actually done writing now. chop chop.

      I'm glad i sit in mcminn county every day and never do anything but babysit and go to k-mart. And yes, that would be IN the store, for you losers that drive up there and stand around your cars. And that's all i have to say about that.

      Ok... so i had this bright idea.. that i would take one of the chickens' eggs and put it under a lamp in my room and see if i could hatch it. The lamp had to stay on 24/7 because the egg had to be kept at 101 degrees.. but the problem is, i can't sleep with any lights on.. at all. So i was up all night.. the last time i looked at the clock, it was like 5:30.. ridiculous, i know. Nevertheless.. i got up and went to church this morning. Sunday school and everything. Go me. And after we go out to eat for Father's Day.. we like.. come home and stuff. And i fall asleep. Then my dad wakes me up and says "Mikey and Clint are here.." and i don't know why because it was DJ and Coby. So the guys are all about some chickens.. so we go up there and like look at them and stuff... and i watch coby make chicken noises for forever while poking the boy chicken with a stick. And let me just tell you.... how exciting that was. If that happens again.. I'll have to die. I'll end the blog for today by stating the fact that i'm in love with these 6 Flags commercials with the dancing old guy.. they always seem to put me in a good mood... save a cowboy, take the bus.

      So i definitely slept til 3 today and i loved it. there were just a few minor interuptions such as phone calls and rachel's unnecessary not to mention unwelcomed entrance to tell me what time it was.. but i love her anyway. And she's dating this way hot guy named bradon williams who is like really good to her.. and he's not gonna cheat on her with a smooshy faced skank *cough* Will *cough*sneeze*chuckle*snort*whatever. but it's all to the groovy. This one's gonna be short because like... i've only been up for an hour so not much has happened today. I'm sure you're all heart broken. I'm getting in the shower. High five.

      ok.. so isn't it cute how everyone wants everyone else to stay out of their business yet they feel like they have to post it on the internet? i thought so too. Nevertheless.. my sister gets her belly button pierced and emilee thought it was... "cute" so now my dad hates emilee. not really but we'll just pretend for the sake of the blog. and since my dad hates emilee.. they've kicked her out and she's never to walk through my doorway again.. not really... but work with me. and so emilee's not ever coming back. actually she is, but i'm going to keep telling myself that she's not for the time being because i decided my parents like her more than me and i wont stand for it. she can feed the chickens if they like her so much. not that i feed them anyway.. but if she comes back she'll have to. and on that note.. i'm the best match maker in the world. you're welcome alison.. and yeah, you owe me big. thanks. i miss the roomdawgs, and rachel isn't moving out anymore. so much for her room.. whatever.

      My dad thinks this is a farm and it's not. Sometimes he buys animals that SHOULD be on a farm.. so they never last long here. We've had emus and ostriches.. no joke. a goat.. he really wants to buy some pigs. But today he buys chickens. Which wouldn't be so bad, except Rach told him i wanted to duct tape Maggie Faggie's butthole shut, so i'm not allowed to play with them. But i figure it's at least a never ending supply of eggs. So i'm ready for halloween. He said i could name the rooster, so i named it Biggun. Which isn't to be pronounced "big gun".. more like "big one" except "biggun"... which is what i call betsy. you can just call her eleanor because that's her real first name, but you didn't hear that from me. and rachel has just told me she's moving out. to wisconsin? scratch that.. she's moving in with sheila. whatever? and now she's telling me i can't come and stay with her but she always says that. i guess i'll move into her room. whoop whoop.

      So i'm supposed to be at Carol's at 9:30 every morning to babysit.. or something like that. And yesterday, i don't leave my house until after 10. Due to the fact that i couldn't wake up because i talked to david til 6 am? And today.. i didn't get there until 9:45 because again i had trouble hearing my alarm because i talked to daniel until close to 5. But Carol was totally cool with that because she and her husband own the trophy house and she doesn't have to be in work at any certain time. I really don't have much to complain about these days..haha cept for the fact that most of the little foreign kids here dont like me... why does that not bother me? Because i AM friends with them all i swear. HAHA whatever. Tomorrow my mom and her best friend are gonna have a yard sale. So everyone go to the Ray's and buy all our cool used stuff. It'll be worth millions. hooty hoo. right... well "i'm out of here, and i'm turning on the light". long story that you wouldn't care about. trust me.

      This one's just going to be about my sister... so like.. if you don't know her or don't like her.. don't read anymore. My life will go on, i promise. So even though she's moved back home, i talked to her more when she was in chattown, cause we would email each other and talk on msn and crap.. and now, when i'm home, she's not and vice versa. But i really love my sister. And i dont drag her into all my drama with me like i do betsy.. so when it's just me and rach i dont have to think about it. It can just be us.. and no worries. But it hasn't been "us" in a long time. Honestly, the only way i know she's still alive.. is i read her stupid blog. And that's the only way i can find out anything that's goin on with her. Occasionally she'll come through here tellin me that she needs online or wants to see what clothes i have of hers. But the most time we spend together lately is when we're being rebels and skipin sunday school (go us) and ridin to church together late. And i'm blaming all of this on the dog. Rachel likes her better, rachel wants to spend all her time with her when she's home.. rachel wants to take her when we're riding to blockbuster.. Maggie is just an intruder and this time, it's the last srraw. How "3 musketeers" of me was that. Point being... Maggie must die. Thanks.

      ok.. so i stayed at the ray's last night and i wake up to "BEKER..(yeah.. "beker".. who knows) don't you have to babysit today?" by their dad and i'm like  crap  and i get up and brush my teeth and look at the clock and i still have like 30 minutes left to sleep and im like  crap . who was definitely not happy? me... does anyone care? Trev does.. and he should because he kept me up til 3 a.m. because we're just cool like that? glad we all agree. so.. my sister is now living at home.. as in "not going back to UTC but going to TWC which is in a*town so she's living at home" home. which only sucks because i loved the roomdawgs and i love going down to chattown with nikki and staying with them and almost being killed everywhere we went. there's just something about waffle house at 3 a.m. that makes you want to spin spinners that happen to be parked right next to the window.. and bring milkshakes to the waitor named "D"'s yard? something like that. but everything will be fine because nikki and i have plans to talk to my parents about favorite Bible verses? yeah.. don't you all wish you were me... crap.

      Well.. the thing is, my eyeball's infected and i'm hoping it'll just fall out of my head here pretty soon so that i don't have to worry about it anymore. And the other thing is.. i'm about to be a senior. Soon i'll be 18. Next year, but still soon. I'll be an "adult".. which is weird because i have zero responsibility, don't have a clue what's going on in the world.. don't even know how to work the dishwasher.. or washing machine or dryer for that matter.. don't take care of the dog.. except for when i volunteer to give it a bath just to see how long i can hold her head underwater.. just kidding. But i don't even clean my own room. My mother does it on wednesdays when she's off work. Don't clean anything else.. don't cook anything besides pizza rolls, ramen noodles and hot pockets. How am i ever going to survive in the real world? eh.. i'm not too worried about it. i actually plan on marrying rich and having a maid. and on her day off.. well i hope the kids like dirty clothes and frozen pizza.. and now i guess i'll just go take a nap..not like i'm planning on doin the dishes or anything.. holler.

      Today was my second day on the job.. i get there, i fall asleep, and i wake up to an 11 year old boy that i'm "babysitting" asking me what i want him to make me for lunch. Life is good. Getting paid for sitting around, wathing tv, and eating other people's food. Forget college. The dog.. Maggie Faggie is unfortunately in great health and doing fine. I thought feeding her popcorn and cheetos® might kill her. Or at least clog her arteries up real good. But i guess everyone's gotta be wrong once in their life. I was hoping my one time of the lack of ability to always be right about everything would come at a time of less importance. But this dog has got to go. I hear that duct tape fixes everything. I might try to tape her mouth shut. Or her butthole, just for laughs. Haha. That was a joke. Well since my plans got rained out i'm off for a night of digging through rachel's drawers and closet to see if she's stolen any more of my cloths, and watching father of the bride part II. Me gustaba las tortugas. Adios padres..

      Ok.. so how many times do you have to make the same mistakes before you actually learn from them? Like all these little girls that run around with guys that cheat on them but take them back over and over.. and let me just state one fact. if they've ever cheated on any of their girlfriends... what makes you think they wouldn't cheat on you!? Great now that that's cleared up.. But i can honestly say out of all my close guy friends and all my girlfriends boyfriends.. i don't know a single guy that hasn't cheated. And cheating is the same thing as lying. And i hate liars. And i hate people that will look you dead in the face and lie to you and not even think twice about it. Imagine that. When it comes down to it, i don't guess i like many people at all. Then again, on days like today, i love everyone. Ain't life gravy. Yeah.. with that said, eleanor elizabeth dougherty is my best friend in the entire world, and i'm going to babysit tomorrow. I love you kat. holler.

      Ok.. this is gonna be a one time thing. I usually don't like to get all mushy in the blog and crap and when i have my little break downs they go to one person or another. But i think everyone needs to hear what i have to say this time.  THERE IS NOT ALWAYS TOMORROW..  So many things have happened lately that have opened my eyes to that. If there is anyone that you care about and would give up anything for.. tell them. Because you never know when it's going to be too late. If there's anyone that you used to be close to but you haven't talked to in a while.. tell them that you miss them because you never know when they'll need you and need to feel like they can come to you. If you've been fighting with someone that you used to love or care about.. just let it go and tell them you're sorry even if you're not the one that was wrong. Just do it. Because there's not always tomorrow. I promise you there's not. And you have to think about how you'd feel if anything happened and you never got the chance to tell them what you needed to. There's never enough time. Do it before it's too late.. because once it's over... it's over. And you can't go back. Clocks only go one way. Each second you watch go by.. you can never get back. If it was bad, you can't go back and change it. But what's worse, if it's good, you can't go back and relive it. Don't say things you'll regret. Life's too short. Don't fight with people you hate. Don't fight with people you love. Just let it all go.. because nothing's worth it. Cherish every moment that means anything. Hang on to them. Keep things to remember stuff by. Take lots of pictures. Live life to the fullest and never let one day go by without something meaningful happening. Never waste a day. It's too short guys.. i hope you've all enjoyed this because it wont happen again. and since moments like you've just experienced are rare, you better take this to heart. And i know you're thinking about someone right now. Call them. For seriously. Then you can thank me.

      Ok... so my cousin Jenna like to go swimming when she's ordering food through drive throughs.. and that always makes for a good laugh. And i have this other cousin that shall remain nameless that likes to take things that don't belong to her, and my sister had a conversation with her yesterday that i found very amusing. It's short.. so enjoy:   Rach:  We should all go to the movies sometime.  Stealer:  I would but i don't have any money.  Rach:  Steal some.   You gotta love her. For those of you that care.. and i'm sure so many of you do... I have a rather large family. Four different aunts and uncles plus my parents.. 12 grandkids.. 3 great grandkids and two on the way. We multiply like rabbits. Never a dull moment. And that's just my mom's side. And out of all the grandkids and great-grandkids, two are boys. That leaves 13 girls. And that's a lot of girls. Family get-togethers are more like slumber parties. And since i've spent an excessive amount of time with them lately i thought i'd share my wonderful family in my blog because all of you are losers and have nothing better to read. Thanks for stopping by. whoop whoop.

       Alright so i guess it's been a little while since i've written and i'm really sorry because i know all you losers have nothing better to do than read about me haha so here it goes.. i just had like the best vacation ever in Destin Florida.. and i'd love to give you details but what happens in Destin stays in Destin so yeah get over it.. i went with my cousin Skye and we met guys every night but we FINALLY found some that we really liked thursday which kinda sucked because we left Friday night but it made the whole trip worth it.. and i got a turtle.. the poor thing almost got named Bob.. along with Timmy, Tommy, and Fred but it's alright cause now's it's just named TJ. Cute huh.. and if turtles' eyes weren't black, this turtle would have like the most gorgeous blue eyes i've ever seen and if it could smile it would have the cutest little dimples but it can't so yeah whatever.. oh yeah and i met this australian guy and he said mate and called me sheila so that's exciting.. at first i thought he was an idiot that couldn't say rebekah but then i figured out that's what they call all girls. so whatever works.. and he made fun of how i talk because apparently i said "ya'll" three times or something.. glad he can count.. but something about Florida makes me hate Tennessee.. and somewhat like Louisiana? Don't ask.. but i miss it.. and i need to go back. and i don't want to go to school. And i just watched the boy in the plastic bubble, which isn't bubble boy for you morons that can't count past 14.. and i went with rachel, her boyfriend and his brother to see the villiage last night.. and i cried. because i suck. i think i was just tired. and that was the first time i met heath (which is brandon's brother and brandon's rachel's boyfriend) and he was really hot but he wasn't as cute as TJ.. who is just my turtle that i like to pretend has blue eyes and dimples.. and i'm actually done writing about all this because i think it's making me sad so i'll have to just do this later..
