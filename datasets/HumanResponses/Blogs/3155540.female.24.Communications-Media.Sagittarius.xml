       The Myth of TINYPANTS   Here's the story that Zaq and I created.  It's very strange, but that's the way we like it....  Sometimes we get bored.  *  = Zaq  ~  = Tara   *  In a village not far from the horizon, TinyPants was near death.  While working in his famous ketchup mine, he fell asleep and a starving donkey ate away his entire midsection.  Jo-junia county, in a sincere act of appreciation, put on a festival for TinyPants so that he may die with a smile on his face.  Unfortunately, TinyPants wouldn't be able to eat anything because his digestive system was in the belly of a burro.  ~ Tinypants mentioned his concerns of having no midsection to the nearest festival participant.  "I have no stomach."  The small man looked at TinyPants, blinked and murmured, "Yes.  It is true. Would you like the midsection of a donkey instead?" TinyPants paused, and reflected on the thought. "Yes, I think I would.  Please pass the donkey." And he started to munch on some donkey liver.  * What a strange circumstance!  After a donkey took TinyPants' stomach, he would, in turn, take the belly of a donkey.  This was going to take some special grammar work.  "But TinyPants," the town's cute girl murmured, "How will you be able to get the operation done before your impending death?"  ~  "Oh my dear Towns-Cute-Girl,  Fret not!  The great God-of-stomachs-Eaten-By-Donkey's (SEBD) will save me!" gleamed TinyPants while staring at the poor girls chest.  The girl looked at TinyPants with a very puzzled expression, and choked "Have you gone mad? There is no such G..."  Just then a gail of flatulent gases rushed through the air around them and a prepubescent sounding voice echoed around them.  "I AM THE GREAT GOD-OF-STOMACHS-EATEN-BY-DONKEY'S!  I AM HERE FOR....uh, what does this say? Tiny what?!  giggle  What an unfortunate name," he mutters under his breath, "His parents must have really...  cough   I mean...I AM HERE FOR TINYPANTS!"   *  "And where is your membership card, Mr. Pants?"  The God roared. "Well, I haven't paid my dues in awhile..."   "Stupid bastard!"    "I've got $4 in my sock.  How's that?" "Yeah, that about covers it."  ~ Tinypants gave the God-of-stomachs-eaten-by-donkeys his $4 and closed his eyes, (the pain was becoming unbearable at this point and Tinypants was having a hard time breathing.  Some doctors might have said that it was because he'd been so long without his mid-section, but this is my story and those doctors can kiss my grits.)  The God of SEBD raised his hand, balled it up, and hit Tinypants squarely in the jaw knocking him completely unconscious.  The Towns-Cute-Girl gasped in horror at the scene, yet was mysterious attracted to the God of SEBD.  She'd never before witnessed such power, not to mention he was immortal, which we all know is a huge turn on.  She started to blush and fiddle with her hair to try and get the God's attention.  The God being completely oblivious rubbed his knuckles and muttered "Well, I guess that is that."  And he vanished in the same flatulent smelling gust of wind that he came in on. The-Towns-Cute-Girl dejectedly walked home.  She was so wrapped up in her rejection by a God that she forgot about TinyPants altogether.  TinyPants awoke to find his mid-section completely intact and a note pinned to his shirt.  It read "the membership fee is actually $6, so I kept one of your kidneys as payment. Signed by the God of SEBD."  TinyPants slowly got up off the ground, and walked back to his ketchup mine.

       Who the hell do I have to sleep with to get some hate mail around here?!   And where's Gretchen?  I was certain that she'd make an appearance to trash my writing, or spelling, or something.  I think that I'm going to have to start picking fights with my friends here on this blog just so I can encourage some nasty behavior.     Hey Kiddies , Check out  urlLink  this article

      I've decided that I need to develop some sort of rating system for each entry.  I am thinking something like " Skipable ", " Crazed Rant ", and " Sheer Lunacy ".  That way a reader can monitor their own reading material, and we can give the FCC the finger.   "#%@$ YOU, FCC!  And the horse you rode in on!"    (Plus, I'll have to do a little censoring until I'm absolutely certain that my mom is actually working at work, and not reading my bloggy blog.) I also think this rating system will allow me to be a bit more liberal with my writing, because lets face it, I have a lot to say but very little worth listening to.  So this should help alleviate both issues.  I also want to quickly inform everyone that my ability to spell correctly is going to drastically decline.  *SOB*  Because my bestest walking Spell Check friend, Fhay aka "Scenecrasher" is leaving for San Francisco this weekend!  Leaving me all alone in a uncaring world of vowels, consonants, and random punctuation.

      Ok, here's a quick list of the things we'd like to  NOT  hear Professor Selby say again.  Revisions and additions welcome. 1) "This kid pee'd on my head once...." 2) "Come on, Tim.  I'm a gentle lover..." 3) "She @%&#ed better than My Uncle Tom." 4) "B.J.'s right to the top for her..." 5) "NO!  Please don't Hump me!" 6) "Um...Puppies taste good..." 7) "I was going to cook the turkey, but some bastard puked on the stove..." 8) "Oh, I have to pee.  Thats why I keep standing up." 9) "I Luuv da cock!" 10)"My boyfriend ain't yo babay's daddy!"  The list goes on, but the FCC is strictly monitoring this site.  Please help me with the stuff I've forgotten.

      I think I just caught the security guard here at work pilfering food from the freezer.  Granted, the poor guy should have some sort of perk to a lousy job.  (Very few people like to work the graveyard shift, and I can vouch for the fact that there is nothing pretty about 3:30am.) But I think that there’s a bit of an ethics problem with stealing peoples food from the workplace refrigerator.   I, myself, am not all too worried about it, but that’s probably because the food he was taking was some rank chicken wings that I dumped off on Professor Selby a few  months  ago.  Chances are that that poultry is going to make that security guard very ill.  I guess it was a risk he was willing to take.  Maybe later on I’ll traipse around this place listening for screams of agony but for now I'm going to enjoy this semi chilly cup of coffee and watch  urlLink this  .

      Oh, and you should always,...ALWAYS keep in mind that I view spelling to be completely optional.  I think that correct spelling really limits my creativity.  I'm convinced that as long as my point is getting across, and the words  look   pretty, then I'm doing very well.  And for some reason I think that  urlLink this  is funny...

      Wow, who would have ever thought that I would step out of the shadows and into the spotlight?  I apparently decided that it was time to quit posting crazy rants on everyone else's blog and take credit for my actions.  Let me tell you in all confidence that it's not going to be pretty.  It's all down hill from here, kiddies.  (It'll only get worse when my ability to post pictures gains momentum.) So buckle up, and grip that yak-bag with all your might.

       The air is biting cold, and as I walk down the path the pine trees all around me shuffle in the cold breeze.  I follow the path, winding just a few feet above the choppy December water.  I know where this path is going.  I've been here hundreds of times before.  As I round a corner in the path, I see him sitting on the cliff overlooking the early morning grey sky.  I quickly sit down next to him, and simply stare.  I watch the wind sift through his chocolate brown hair and wonder how after 50 years he still thinks that a checked flannel jacket is the warmest garment he could wear.  I can't bring myself to speak, because I'm afraid that I will wake up, and he won't be here anymore.  He continues to stare out at the lake.  Then as he raises his palm to the sky, one large perfectly formed snowflake falls into his hand.  I lift my own palm to the sky to cradle another fat flake.  He turns to me and smiles.  "Happy Birthday, Princess."  As I lean my head on his shoulder, I say "I miss you Dad."    The phone rings.  Damn.  I roll over in bed to look at the clock.  7:23am.  She's right on time.  Every year within a few minutes.  "hellloo?" "Haaaaaa ppy Birthday TOOO YOOOU!" "Hi mom." "Happy Birthday, Sweetheart." "hee hee.  Happy birthday to me.  Am I grown up yet?" "I doubt it, honey." "Hey.  You're my mom.  You're supposed to be nice to me on my birthday." "...I love you, sweetheart." "Love you. ....I miss him, Mom." "I know, sweetheart.  We all do." "So what are you doing today, honey?"  I sit up in bed, "Uh...I don't know yet....Holy Shit!" "What is it?" "It's snowing!  It never snows this early....thats really weird."

      After my dad died I discovered that there is actually a limit to the things a person can deal with at any one time.  This was a bit of a surprise to me, and it took some time before I could accept it to be true.  So, I found that it was imperative for me to decide which things, events and people would receive my attention, and which would not.  I wasn't being hurtful or judgmental, I just didn't have the capacity to deal with everything.    The priorities fell into: grieving, being available for my family, putting the estate/possessions in order, getting enough sleep (very important), and school.    This kinda threw my friends and associates to the bottom of the list.  If a friendship can't easily exist without constant management and maintenance, then it was doomed to be ignored.  I just didn't have the ability to give a shit.  Several long-term friendships have bitten the dust over the last year and half.  Some for the better, and some were unfortunate casualties of changing times.  Tabitha, gone.  Dave, bye.  Michelle, don't let the door hit ya' on your way out.  Siobhan, hope all goes well.  Abby, later gator.  Angie, get out.   (There's more, but I dont' care enough to list them.)  The thing is, that I also have several friendships that have gone completely unphased.  These are my favorites, because there is nothing expected of either party.  Even if a long period of time passes between interactions, we just pick up where we left off.   Jenny, Drooler, Kinki-lee, Chris, Smelley, Emi, Ali-Cat, McFatass, Tina, Fhazzer, Chistina, Zaq, and of course Wallace.

      For the most part, I really don't venture out of my preferred genre of music.  I like equal doses of Classic Rock, Indie, EMO, and Alternative(ish).  I'm pretty open minded to closely related genres, but I just can never seem to get into country, or Rap/R&B.   After taking an example from Professor Selby, (I don't recommend you try it,) I've spent the morning listening to the R&B/Rap Sampler on Rhapsody.  My preferences are as follows:  * = sucks ** = wouldn't play it in my car *** = can pretend it's not playing **** = would hum along ***** = will probably stay in the club playing it.   ARTISTS  (If you can call them that...) -Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliot :  ***  -Eryka Badu :  ***  -50 Cent :  ****  -Ludacris :  ***** + **   (so funny!) -Busta Rhymes :  ****  (WHOOHA!) -OutKast :  *****  -DMX :  *  -Eve :  ***  -Jay Z :  **  -Puffy Puffer-ness, or whatever:  Negative ****  -Jurassic 5 :  **  -Black Eyed Peas :  **  -Lil Kim :  ***  -Sean Paul :  ****  (hee hee. He talks funny.) -Nelly :  ****   All in all you'd be hard pressed to find any of this in my CD collection.  But then again my brother is a little Frattie Brattie, and likes to burn me CD's that force you to turn your hat slightly skewed, and bob your head.    I feel so ashamed.  I'm going for a hot shower.

      Consider this a warning to all participants in the male gender.  I, Millty, being of sound mind and body do hereby solemly swear to kick the teeth in of the next man I encounter making a sexist, and or obscene sex statements.  Examples of these kinds of statements are as follows:  -"I need a girlfriend so that I can have regular sex." -"She's perfect in every way, but she's a little fat.  Do you think I can ask her to loose some weight?" -"Her friend wears tight clothes.  I bet she'd be in for a threesome." -"I really enjoy talking to you.  Can you get your ankles behind your head?" -"She's nice, but at the end of the day she's just another fat girl, now isn't she." -"Nah, she is good on her knees." -"If only she had a flat top head, no teeth and big ears, she'd be perfect." -"Yeah, she's got those great wide hips.  Bet she can pop out babies like no ones business." -"You're great.  And I bet you've got a mouth like a hoover." -"Its all about the punani."  (which is the stupidest phrase I've ever heard.)  I understand that I have no power, and no right to ask this walking wastes of skin to not say these things.  I have no power to change the way they think.  But I do have the power to eliminate myself from the situation.  So, If you can see yourself making comments similar to, but not exclusive to the phrases above, then understand fully why it is I look at you as if you're lower than pig shit. And if you could just be so kind as to leave me the fuck alone.

      Dear Tara, I know what you're thinking.  I know because I've been riding shotgun to your conscience, and have been watching through your eyes for some time.  A unique team we are.  And I want to tell you that I know. I know that sometimes its too deep to objectively get out of.  That self-evaluation that is real and uncompromising.   There are no foofy song birds to tell you it will all work out perfectly.   There is no ray of sunshine to split through the murky waters of your mood.   The truth of the matter is that you are not important.   There is no one who needs you.   There is no good that you provide that the world will miss.  For the most part you are just another competitor for some breathable air and livable space.    You can wake up every morning and tell youself that it's important you get out of bed and shower.  It's important you make that cup of coffee.  Its important that you drive into work to produce something that no one sees and no one cares about.  You can sit at a computer for 10 hours a day convincing yourself that you need to be there.  That what you are doing is important.  Its not.   The only person who benefits from your day to day existence is you.  The only person who finds you important is you.   Your neighbors won't notice if you don't wake up one morning. Your boss will just fire you and find some other stupid shit to do your mindless work. You rarely interact with your friends, so they won't notice if you don't answer your phone.  Once this realization takes hold it is damn hard to shake. I know. But it is imperative that you do. Because without this meaningless day to day life, there will be No. More. YOU.  And that's important.  TO YOU.  And now you know.

      You know that little voice in the back of your mind that tells you  "It is detrimental to our wellbeing that you stop talking about this topic."   Or at more important times it says  "SHUT UP, YOU RAVING IDIOT!"  Yeah.  Well I don't have one of those.  I've been meaning to purchase one, but they never go on sale.  All I've got to say for myself is " Umm, my feet taste goooood ."

      After an excruciating conversation with the notorious "he-man" last night, I discovered that he has a soft spot for Guns n Roses, (which makes him one handlebar mustache away from living in a trailer)  thats for the 'creed' comment, asshole!   and has never heard any Led Zepplin songs other than what I've forced him to listen to.  His comment was "Led Zepplin is folky crap."    Excuse me?!  What did you say?!  So in the name of all things holy... i.e.  Rock and Roll  ! I've listed a few musicians that I used to like, but now wish would just wither up and die.   DIE!   1)  REM.   Ohmygod,go away    2)  Everclear.  Who gives a shit about volvo driving soccer moms.   3)  Smashing Pumpkins  Tell that whiney Billy kid to SHUT UP!   4)  Blink 182  All Pop Punk can go get F*#&ed!   5)  The White Stripes  Take a shower, brush your hair and call me when you have a new catchy piece of shit.   unfortunately, The list of musicians that still make me dance around my livingroom like a dork, but am too ashamed to mention is much longer.  (I.E. Matchbox 20) I shouldn't have told you that.   The CD's in constant rotation seem to be a mix of 'sublime', 'incubus', 'fuel', 'ben harper', 'jack johnson', and 'radiohead'.  I find that these are always good for me.

      I am a hypocrite.  A huge hypocrite.  A ginormous (for lack of a real word) hypocrite.  Everytime I've seriously dated someone I change, or morph a part of my personality to better suit the relationship.  My track record is as such:    hypocrisy 1  = I attended church, youth groups, listened to Christian rock. (Not as much by choice as that's just what was continually playing.) I even sat in a few little prayer circles with my little eyes closed, looking oh-so-intent, holding hands with other praying kiddies.  (You can be guaranteed that I was most certainly NOT praying.)  I was usually thinking about what I needed to pick up from the store on my way home.  The boy I was dating at this time was overly religious in a 'hyper-christian' sorta way.  And I guess because I was interested in him that somewhere in my mind it was important that I pretended to be interested in this.  You all should know that I am not now, nor have I ever been religious.  The point is that I would go to school, smoke, swear, cheat, and generally just be a snotty little kid.  Then I would visit this boy and become a saint.  All of the foul lingo erased, and the cigarettes hidden.     hypocrisy 2  = I attended motorcross.  Need I say more?  I mean, who really is interested in motorcross?!  Honestly! It's certainly not me.  But, later I pretended to be, in a milder version of hypocrisy 1. (I am much too ashamed to go into detail.)   hypocrisy 3  = I became super interested in money, and looking it.  It was perfect hair.  Perfect makeup.  Perfect skirts, heels, nails, pressed blouses.  Those of you who know me must be thinking  "What?!  I've never seen Tara in a skirt. When was this?!"   It sounds like a fabrication, but it's true.  If left uninfluenced I revert back to my natural state of soft t-shirts, flip flops, and loose jeans.  Make up is something I don't have time for.  It's been one new guy with one "new hobby" after another.  And as of this point I just have a great big list of things that suck.  BLAH!      How depressing.   But entirely True.

      Remember those stupid posters and 'feel good' books that had such titles as  "Things I learned in kindergarten."   Or even more ridiculous  "Things I learned from my cat."   These half-witted writings included such sayings as 'be sure to share', or 'don't lick yourself in front of guests,' etc. etc.  As ludicrous as these stupid things were, I'm too brain-dead to think of something clever.  So, in the same theme, I give you:   THINGS I LEARNED FROM 'SOGGY BOOTS'   ~If you wear big cowboy boots to a bar with the intention to smuggle a bottle of beer out, be sure that the bottle mouth is not facing down, thus filling your shoe with beer.  ~If cutting down large pine tree's for firewood, be sure that the trees path to the ground is not obscured by your truck.  ~Flannel, (apparently,) goes with everything.  ~There was nothing good about disco.  ~If you need your kids to wake up and help you with the yard work, 115 decibels of  Iron Butterfly  works really well.  (FYI, I believe the ear drum bursts at 140 decibels.)  ~Surprising a sleeping dog is funny.  Surprising a sleeping cat is painful.  ~It is not only your responsibility, but also your DUTY to harass your siblings.  It builds character, and who are you to deny them character building moments?  (You can be sure that they will return the favor.)  ~Rolling a '72 Blazer is actually quite easy.  Telling your parents about it is not.  ~Try not to brag to your kids about how you out-ran a cop in your old '68 firebird.  (You'll never win another argument from that point on.)  ~Always sound like you know what you're talking about, especially if you don't have a clue.  ~If you're working on a car of foreign make, it helps to swear at it in its native language.    ~Reruns of 'Startrek' and old western are always on TV.  (Unfortunately.)  ~If you've burnt the nights meal, you can impress your guests by telling them that it is 'Cajun'.  ~One of your biggest responsibilities is to watch out for your family.  Especially if they tend to be lunatics.  Hey, Wussy & Chumpzilla.  What did I forget?

      Every so often I run into some momentary tid bit of disturbing information, or a slightly disturbing encounter.  Am I simply disturbed? You bet your sweet ass I am.   But this just happened:  Get up.  Walk to bathroom.  Quietly open door.    What the hell was that?!  Did that woman just grunt?  In the bathroom?! Oh my god.    Silence quickly ensues, and the embarrassment is as obvious as a 30ft neon sign flashing over the stall saying "Guess what I'm doing in here!" Hold breath. Turn on heel.  Walk away as fast as possible.   Yeah, that's right.  There's a grunter here at work, and this time it wasn't Fhay.  Unfortunately, this isn't the first time I've been unlucky enough to be present for 'the grunters' demonstration. Blech.  I wish there was whiskey in the coffee.  Instead,I'll just sit back and watch  urlLink this

      Well, the votes are in.  First I'd like to thank all of the parties involved for their expertise and their input.  (And will ya' just look at the number of comments!)  There were a lot of good points provided for us to ponder...well except the crap about the deserted island.  That was bogus.  But all in all points well made. Secondly I'd like to just quickly point out that the club He-Man was trying to get into was probably a Chuckie Cheese, where a kid can be a kid and a creepy old guy can leer at them in public.  After yesterday's discussion the conclusion I've come to is thus:  Q:    Is a platonic friendship possible between two people of the opposite sex?   A:   Yes.  It's entirely possible when neither party is attracted to the other.  I'm convinced that pheromones play a huge role in attracting people.  If there isn't that attraction, then both parties are free to grunt, slap each others asses and/or go shopping together for matching pink sockies.  It can and does happen, but like I said, it all comes down to pheromones.  Q:    Does a purely platonic friendship between two people of the opposite sex happen very often?   A:   Not from what I can tell.  It seems that a large portion of the time one person has an interest in the other that, perhaps isn't reciprocated.  I spent the last several seconds dissecting my own seemingly platonic friendships and what I've come up with is this: 2 = admitted they had had crushes on me at some point. 1 = told me that a platonic friendship was flat out impossible between two people.  Which was a little awkward at that time, but the good news is I'm really talented when it comes to acting ignorant. 2 = still maintain that we're just platonic friends, and always have been.  And I would use this for the basis for my argument if it weren't for those silly conversations they initiated: "Do you think that two people who are really great friends have the potential to be really great in a relationship as well?"  Also awkward.  (If you're wondering, my answer was 'no'.) 3 = I had itty-bitty crushes on at some point, (which quickly wore off, but whose to decide the best way to meet a friend?!)   Q:    Is a platonic friendship less likely if the two people in question are attractive people?   A:   I think that only a guy would assume that to be the case.  Being very visual creatures you guys tend to base all of your judgments on what can be seen.  I can say with certainty, that most of my guy friends are  very  attractive guys, and get a lot of girly attention...Just not from me.  Some should even be models. That doesn't mean that I've been attracted to them.  (For the most part, I'd say that I am pretty oblivious to what's going on around me.)   The important thing to note here is that regardless of underlying issues and motivations, guys and gals DO, in fact have friendships without romance.  Happens all the time, Folks.   NOW, the real question is:   Can two people who dated seriously, become platonic friends afterwards?    Tara says:  Probably not.  But we'll see.

       Question:  Can Girls and Guys be completely platonic friends?     If you're the only person alive who doesn't know what I mean, then I'll define "platonic" for you, and maybe I'll even learn a thing or two.   1 capitalized : of, relating to, or characteristic of Plato or Platonism 2 a : relating to or based on platonic love; also : experiencing or professing platonic love b : of, relating to, or being a relationship marked by the absence of romance or sex.  Did ya' get that?  That means no romance between one guy and one girl who are friends, and actually spend time together.  (For the sake of my argument, both are heterosexual.)  I've always maintained that platonic friendship is not only possible, but the common state of being for two individuals of the opposite sex.  I say this because I have always had close guy friendships that have never been romantic.  The reason I bring the topic up is that I've recently been accused of being a bit naive on the subject.  My brother maintains that (generally) a guy wouldn't just be friends with a girl unless there was romantic interest or potential.    What are your thoughts?   And what the hell happened to Blogger?!  I spend two days away from the pc, sitting in front of my tv watching "the office" and they go changin' the whole damn thing!  Not to mention someone has taken off with my comments section!

      In a rare occurrence I felt a pang of guilt yesterday.  It transpired after I used gorilla warfare tactics to get more of my friends to pay attention to me.  The pang was only momentary though and I realized that it was a Brilliant move!  And conducted with great success!  As I mentioned, I like to refer to this as "developing my audience."  I'll have to be sure to do it again, but maybe next time with different people.  Perhaps my old ex's?  Or even Selby's friends?  I may have to wait a bit to harass the masses again.  Mostly because I think the village people would become restless, and chase me with torches and pitch forks...  Again.   But to kill the time between mockings I decided to go to  urlLink thespark.com  and check to see how dateable I am.  I wanted to see how much of a Wench I tend to be, but they wanted a blood sample, and I never donate before 9am.  But as it turns out, I'm  43% Dateable.  No big surprise there.  I discovered that I'm attracted to prawns, and the best place to meet people is "at the airport, going the wrong way on the escalator".  Also no big surprise.  I highly recommend that you check out the link on my sidebar labeled 'quizipoo's' and find out more about yourself than endurable.

      Here is the official posting of friends,…. Ahem, I mean ‘minions’ that think its funny to visit my site for a free chuckle and not make a single damn comment.  These Bastards are about to be appropriately punished.  The list is as follows:   The names and faces have been changed slightly in order to protect…well, me.      1. Wussy  is a frattie brattie at Sigma Nu best known for his expertise in drinking games, catchy T-shirt slogans, and how to spend no less than $3000 to NOT fix his Jeep.  Not to mention he is extremely skilled in pissing off his older (and much more attractive) sister.  2. Chuck  is a slackass who eats too much soy and granola, being the hippie lover that he is.  Spends most of his time not progressing on his schoolwork, shaving his legs, and trying not to be mowed down in traffic while on his bike.  3. McChunky  is a closeted exhibitionist who’s favorite past time is flashing his ass at unsuspecting motorists, and newly acquired associates.  Also enjoys rock climbing, but not after alcoholic beverages.  4. Emi  likes to imitate a cute koala bear by sitting high up in trees, and eating eucalyptus leaves.  Oh, and she makes beer.  Ok, Ok, so I can’t find anything demeaning about Emi, but give me time.   5. Ali-Cat  is stuck in the middle of $#&ing Nowhere claiming to study, (which we all know is bull$hit,) and mistreating her poor cell phone.  I’ve heard she still carries the mobile device around even though its service has been turned off.  6. Gas  is a computer geek, who you’d THINK would visit this damn site once in awhile, but apparently is too special to bother.  What a wanker.  7. Zaq  is the funniest bugger I’ve known. (sorry selby,)  Now that that has been established, you should know to never ask him what it is he does for a living.  Its top secret.  He could have told me, but I didn’t want to die.  8. Whipple  is a really nice guy who will probably scream at the top of his voice “I am NOT a nice guy!  I’m an a$$hole!  Why can’t you people see that?!”  9. Mundo  is a newly established transvestite.  Lets just say he watched too much Eddie Izzard, and decided that stiletto heals look great on guys.  Too bad he makes such an ugly woman.  10. Drooler  is trouble, and it’s just better that he not visit this site.  As a matter of fact I may have to keep him quarantined from the rest of the minions.  He’ll pervert their little minds with a simple look.  Consider yourselves punished! (oh, and Crawford, Smelley, Jerome-Rome, Hosers, and Kinki don't think that you're going to get out of being reprimanded.  I have to have something to do tomorrow.)  Now I'm going to shut up, and watch  urlLink this

      17 posts?  Wow, that's a new record for a bloggy blog that isn't even slightly political, religious, or even interesting.  This isn't even a college blog where I would share all the answers to our most hated professor's final, although I kinda' wish it was.  I'm always up for something deviously cunning.  But! back to my point. I hope you know what this means, kiddies.  This makes you all my little minions.  (The matching minion uniforms have already been ordered.)  I'm very excited about this.  I've always wanted minions to do my dirty work.  Well not all of my dirty work, but most of it.  I certainly wouldn't think of making one of my wonderful minions clean Waffles fish bowl (see comments for "waffles" reference.)  But I might encourage one of you to shop for my Mom on mothers day.  (Psst!  She likes anything that smells like Plumeria flowers.)  Here is some good news.  We can now discuss openly what we'll get Mom now that she's assured me that she won't be tuning into the Playground anymore.  I believe her exact words were, "It was kinda cute, but I got confused when everyone started talking back and forth to each other in some sort of under 30 kid-code."  So it's now safe, my little minions.  Go about your minioning!    Stay tuned for my next chore.  I plan to locate the Minions that have gone AWOL, and rip them apart.

      After spending the weekend at my Alma Matter I have decided to do an experiment on whether attending classes actually makes a student dumber.  I am fairly certain that there is positive proof that this is the case, but further research is in order.  I'll need a heart monitor, six pints of Mac & Jacks, and a set of jumper cables.  But first I'd like to introduce my three test subjects.   Subject #1 ,    "Chuckie",    spends hours upon hours at his work station finishing homework, trying to simply pass the classes required for his degree in Forestry Management,...or some ridiculous  major like that. Claim: "I swear I must have A.D.D., or something.  I can't seem to focus enough to get my shit done."   Subject: #2 ,   "Kinky-Lee",  Works two jobs, spends nights hammering out homework so that she can graduate this summer with her degree in Journalism/Radio broadcasting. Claim: "I must have A.D.D.  I just hate sitting here and working on this crap."   Subject #3 ,   " Wussy ", parties like its' 1999, furiously uses few remaining brain cells to further degree in Mechanical engineering. Claim: "I think I have A.D.D. or something.  I seriously can't remember shit.  Damn.  School sucks."  Let us notice that all three subjects seem to be convinced that the fault lies within themselves, and are certain that they suffer from a very serious disorder such as Attention Deficit Disorder because they have no interest in working on homework.  (Also notice that NONE of the test subjects mentioned that their regular consumption of alcoholic beverages, and erratic sleep patterns may be effecting their work performance.)    But, I ask you, is the fault really theirs?  Or is it a by-product of an overzealous educational system which overloads each subject with ridiculous mind numbing amount of useless busywork?     Discuss amongst yourselves...  Thus far the evidence is inconclusive, and such research demands more time, but as we all know I don't have the attention span for that kind of crap.  Now, where the hell did I set my beer?  I should also mention that my previous experiment has produced very interesting results.  Apparently, plants actually  don't     like a strict diet of cherry coke, and will wither up and die.

      I'm visiting my friends and family this weekend in Idaho, and this morning I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the state of my well being was being discussed on the local radio station.  This would mostly be because my good friend Kari works on the morning show for 104.3 The Border in Pullman.  I feel like I'm famous!  hee hee!  So other than dealing with the idiocy that is my family, I am having a great weekend.  Who would have guessed?  I was a little disappointed to see flames shoot out from under my firebirds hood, but it's always good to get your pulse racing everyonce in awhile.   Speaking of racing pulses, has anyone heard out of the Scenecrasher kid?  I'm dyeing to know how the move went.   By the way I've added links to the sidebar for my pictures from Hawaii.  Check 'em out.

      It’s always there.  I can feel it lurk around the fringes of my consciousness.  I’m completely aware of It and can, for the most part ignore It.  But some days, like today, It gets enough courage to sneak up and slap my face.  I’m powerless when it breaks loose.  Sometimes Its escape hatch is triggered by a song, a smell of cologne, or perhaps a picture.  But one location sets it free every God Damn Time.  I hate this particular place and try to stay away from it as much as I can.  I wouldn’t admit it openly, but I pretty much moved to a completely different state so that I wouldn’t ever have to be forced to drive by of this location.  Today I will drive by this location.  Nothing I can do about it, I just have to.  And I can tell you exactly what I’ll do.  Three blocks before, I will change the CD in my car to something obnoxious, and I will turn that bastard stereo up as loud as I can tolerate with minimal bleeding from my ears.  Then I’ll pound on the steering wheel in time to whatever hateful, screaming song is playing.  I’ll race around other cars, and be horridly reckless in general until I am safely past this place.  The place is like a magnet, sometimes It whispers in my ear and forces me against my better judgment to pull into the parking lot.  Usually armed with flowers, and kleenex.  The first time I ever went there was the only reason to never go back.  I wasn’t alone.  I was supported by my brother Bret on one side, who would have looked oh-so-dashing in his new suit if it hadn’t been for the look of pain and sorrow on his face, and my mother, wearing a similar expression.  As a matter of fact, everyone was wearing that damn expression.  You’d have thought it was on sale that day, because I know mine was a perfect mirror image of theirs.  Everyone was there wearing that look.  Cousins: Charlie, Keith, Justin, and Nathan.  Uncle Pat, and Aunt Kathleen.  Grandma’s expression was a bit more intense, but Grandpa made up for it by being a little more wooden faced and staring at the sky.  We were all there holding each other up, because it seemed that the person, whose presence normally would have allowed us all to be strong on our own, was gone.  …Well, technically he was there.  But we could say that he was the only one not quite as vertical.  How’s that.  I hate the way this damn place always smells like moss and dirt, because there is always fresh dirt around.  I really hate that the first time I went I would sit so quietly.  Listening.  For any little sound.  But they don’t put bells in pine boxes anymore.  Listening to something other than my own whimpering.    So, today I’ll go.  I’ll bring the most unusual looking flowers that I can find at the near by grocery store, and you’ll find me kneeling in the grass.  I’ll be the one crying.  You’ll know it’s me, because I’ll be the one whispering, “I miss you, Dad.” And Bret will eventually make me walk back to the car.  I know this, because we’ve danced to this tune before.  In case you were wondering, this morning It was set free by James Taylor’s “Fire and Rain”, (and perhaps a good dose of anticipation towards this afternoon.)  That song is a guaranteed ticket out for It.  So is the smell of Old Spice aftershave.    It has several names.  “Sorrow”. “Grieving”.  “Loss”.  “Loneliness”.   But I call it “Leave me be!” and that usually works.

      And, Yes they were.  Yowza!  They were definitely a sight to behold.  This weekend, the annual Iron Man Triathalon took place in Coeur d' Alene, Idaho where I spent my weekend.   These poor bastards start with a 2.4 mile swim in the frigid waters of Lake Coeur d' Alene.  They then emerge looking like grape smugglers just in time to have some oh-so-lucky volunteer strip their wet suit off and dress them for the  112 MILE  biking portion. Followed closely by a  26.2 mile  marathon!   Impressed?  Well, you will be once I mention that the winner does all of the above mentioned forms of torture in  8 hours, 42 minutes, and 56 seconds .  Jesus!  I spent my weekend trolling around CDA just admiring the scenery.  And by 'scenery', I mean all of the hot men.  But you probably knew that.

      Oh, kiddies I wish I could say it was over, but alas.  This is not to be the case.  I feel that I interviewed very well today, but my very last interview had to be postponed until Wednesday.    Poop.  I'm going to keep holding my breath, though.  I hope that I don't kill off too many brain cells from lack of oxygen.

      I've gone way past 'nervous' this morning, and now have a comfortable seat in 'twitchy'.  My interviews are tomorrow, and my stomach is performing its own interpretive dance to the tune of seven cups of coffee.      I say 'interviews' because there is more than one.   There are six ! But to be fair with myself, I have been offered every job that I have interviewed for.  I've turned some down, however.  You'd think that would comfort me a bit, wouldn't you.  But no.  Not even the knowledge that I'm pretty much applying for a job that I've been doing for the last year soothes my nerves.  I need a beer.  What's the rule for drinking, Bret?  "Not before 5?"  That's A.M., right?

      It was the shriek that woke me up.  The woman next door screamed at the top of her lungs, and then continued to yell in a tone more suitable for a WWF arena.  I could hear her scream the same phrase over and over, but it was indecipherable.  I couldn't figure out what language she was speaking.  In a lower, calmer tone I could hear her husband/boyfriend/whoever the hell he is, saying something as well.    I rolled over to check out the clock.  Great.  A lovers dispute just three hours before I have to get up.  Thanks guys.  The woman is frantic, but not crying.  Not yet anyway.  She's shrieking, but try as I might, I cannot figure out what language she's speaking.  From the sounds of it, he's trying to console her, but it's certainly not working.  I remember thinking that he's got a nice tone to his voice, but it sounds like he's just making the situation worse.  After 15min of staring at the clock and listening to the dispute there is a loud crash against the wall near my bed.  Whatever it was it was big, and now it is very broken.  There is no way these people are getting their damage deposit back.  The woman starts to scream again.  Not saying anything, just screaming.  This scares Jeb awake, and he howls.  The howl must have startled the fighters, because they are silent for a few brief moments.  Then there is a thud, like someone being hit, and an even louder thud against the wall which was followed by a sob.  Was someone just slammed against the wall?  Now I'm fully awake, and my heart is pounding.  Shit.  They're beating each other over there.    The door slams, shaking the pictures on my wall, and an engine starts outside.  I am to assume that she took off in his car, because he then stood in the parking lot yelling and chasing after it.  The funny part is that she tagged a cement post as she was backing out of the parking space, and it sounds as though she gauged the side of his late 80's BMW.  All of this took about 45 min to play itself out.  Unfortunately, it was just enough to fully wake me up.  And I spend the next 2 hours thinking about all of the fights I've been in, and how I never want to experience one like that I've just heard.  Then I thought of all the possible scenario's that would cause a couple to treat each other that way.  Did he cheat on her?  I'd be surprised.  He's nothing special, but it's probably most likely.  Did she cheat on him?  Possibly, but I can't imagine him staying that calm.  I'm betting it was something much more mundane, and stupid.  That seems to be the way it always works out.  Either way, I doubt that there is any amount of make-up sex that will fix this conflict.

      Well, since none of you skunksucking bastards want to hear about the random shit that I was going to share, then you're going to be forced to listen to whatever the hell I feel like talking about this morning.   The good news is that I want to talk about my breasts. The bad news is, they're smaller. I realize that that still doesn't put me in the 'average chest size' zone, and a significantly smaller chest is exactly what I was trying to achieve when I started getting serious about training. But this is kinda freakin me out. I figured that with the genetics that I suffer through that my chest would be the last area to get smaller. When in reality it's among the first. (The ass is being stubborn, but the ankles look great.) I know, some of you girls are saying "Ooh, poor Tara. Whaaa. Do you have to suffer with a D-cup instead of your normal DD? Poor little baby." But it's a scary thought to think of having no chest and a big ass. Things have to stay balanced, here. It was fine when it was big ass, big chest. But now I'm getting worried. I'm going to look like a female verstion of the sloth off of 'The Ice Age'....only with less hair and better teeth. Same lisp, though.   Oh, well. I guess I could always become a contestant on 'The Swan' and maybe they'd fix 'em for me. That's pretty ironic, though. That's not exactly the procedure I had envisioned myself needing...ever.   Good thing Victoria's Secrets caters more to the smaller of chests, and not so much the larger.   LONG LIVE THE PUSH-UP BRA!  ~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~

      What's the opposite of 'writers block'? Is it 'writers inspiration'?  Professor Selby, being the wordsmith that he is, offers the term 'cranial diarrhea'.  (He also really liked the term 'skunksucking bastard', but I'm not sure how to put that into context so it'll just have to be happy as the title.)  I can't decide what to talk about.  So, I figured that I'd list the possibilities and see what people are interested in hearing.  I'm also open to suggestions.  1)The girl standing in line at lunch with a spider crawling up her ear. 2)Getting MY car fixed for FREE!  You heard it kids!  Being a cutie helps you to get your car fixed for FREE. 3)Seeing HIM again. (Its a gamble for the mystery, but I won't elaborate today.) 4)The importance of having missed 'Car d'Lane', with its largest number of late '60's firebirds ever.   5)My plans for the rest of the summer if I don't get this job. 6)The white hairs on Jebs face as indicators of his mortality. 7)The beat down that Matt will receive if he threatens to rub himself on anything in the office again. 8)How a person could never meet the love of their life while drinking a Piña Colada. 9)The hazards of taking the person you've been dating to a friends wedding. 10)And if no one wants to hear about any of this random shit, then I'll be more than happy to talk about my lack of sex life.  Cast your vote, or piss off.

      "See the lacing around the top of the glass?" "Yup." "That is the hydrophobic....( beer related micro biology information ensues )...and that's why certain beers have more foam than others.  Hey.  Tara! Are you listening to me?" "Huh? Oh, yeah.  You're talking about the hydro-phillies playing in the foam.  But I can't see how sea horses ever come into contact with beer in their natural environment."  *THE LOOK*  "Come on, Emi.  That was funny.  Admit it." "Dammit Tara!"  "I thought it was funny.  Look, Emi, you can't possibly expect me to retain that information.   I am a VIS. COMM. major .  I make things look  pretty .  That's what I do.  I have only the most passing interest in micro biology." "Oh, no.  I don't expect you to retain any of this, as a matter of fact I hope you don't, because then I get to look forward to telling you all about it again.  And again.  And again." "Shit."

      It seems to me that my life likes to develop in cycles, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that the term 'Culmination' applies.  A new opportunity arises.  I pursue it to it's furthest extent.  Then it ends leaving just enough room for the new opportunity to come waltzing in.  Am I the only one who has noticed this type of pattern?   That seems to be the point I'm at now.  The endeavors that I've been following for the last several months are gently coming to an end, and just beyond my tangible perception are little sprouts of opportunities to come.  All I really have to say is:  "It's about damn time."

      "Miller, why do you put up with that crap?" "I don't know.  I think, perhaps the 'crap index' was a lot lower before." "Bullshit.  You should have given 'em the finger months and months ago." "I know, I know, but sometimes its just easier to go with the flow then to rock the boat. Ya' know?" "Well, you know I don't really have room to talk, but you know who's to blame, right?" "Saturday Morning Cartoons?"  *The Look*  "No." "Right, I know.  It's me.  And you'd be the second jackass to point that idea out." "So what are you going to do?" "I'm going to sit back and see what happens.  Good things happen when you're not busy ignoring them.  That's my philosophy." "I thought your philosophy was 'No Regrets, No Bullshit, and Everybody Wang Chung Tonight'." "Right.  That too."   Now, Shut the hell up, and watch  urlLink this.

      Somehow, you have to believe that:  1. Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.  2. The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U. N. resolutions against Iraq.  3. "Standing Tall for America" means firing your workers and moving their jobs to India.  4. A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.  5. Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery.  6. The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.  7. Group sex and drug use are degenerate sins unless you someday run for governor of California as a Republican.  8. If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.  9. A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then demand their cooperation and money.  10. HMOs and insurance companies have the interest of the public at heart.  11. Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.  12. Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.  13. It is okay that the Bush family has done $ millions of business with the Bin Laden family.  14. Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.  15. A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense. A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.  16. Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.  17. The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's Harken Oil stock trade are none of our business.  18. You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have a right to adopt.  19. What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.  20. Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.  21. Affirmative Action is wrong but that it is ok for your Daddy and his friends to get you into Yale, the Texas Air National Guard, Harvard Business School, part owner-ship of Harken Oil, part ownership of the Texas Rangers, the Governorship of Texas and then have the Supreme Court Appoint you President of the USA!

      Today's topic is "The Look".  "The Look" conveys a clear message to the recipient.  That particular message is as such:   ~" That was possibly the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  And I've heard you say some pretty stupid things."    Also an acceptable message:   ~"How do you function with such a severe case of stupidity.  I'm surprised you have enough intelligence to breath."   I have been the recipient of this gaze on several occasions.  Most of the time its distributed without discrimination from my wussy brother.  Actually, my little brother is so skilled at distributing this look, that he deserves some sort of acknowledgment.  (He's not going to get it here, however, because he's a little shit.)  But, one can recognize "The Look" by watching for the following:   1) the eye lids drop to half mast, as if they can't be bothered with really looking at you.   2) frequently, the head won't even turn to face the recipient, but instead just look out the corner of the eye.  (This tactic is for those truly skilled at "The Look", and should only be attempted after dedicated practice.)  3) the corners of the mouth pull back in a slight grimace, as if the actual words produced are the cause of the most wretched and foul odor.  4) long moment of silence as the distributor of "The Look" gives you the opportunity to realize your own stupidity.

      While visiting family out of town this weekend, some dumbshit (who shall remain clueless,) sent me this series of text messages.  "u back frm bar hoser?"   what are you talking about?   "stupid drunk"   I don't know who you were talking to, but it wasn't me.  I'm in Spokane.   Needless to say, the dumbass didn't respond to that last one, and must have realized that he had spent the night drunk off his ass, talking to some other blonde.    Idiot.

      I walked out of the restaurant closely followed by my brother and mother.  We laughed as we strolled to the car. "Tara!"  shit! I've been spotted.  This town is too small.  I turn to see the person so intent on having my attention.  Who is tha...awe damn.  "You're just going to walk by and not even say anything?" "I'm sorry, I didn't see you. How are you?" He doesn't look much like the image I have of him sketched in my mind.  He looks better, in fact.  A little stronger, a little older, a few more lines around his eyes indicate that he's seen a little more hard times, and a little more laughter.  My mother and brother turn and continue to head to the car. "So you living in town?" "Oh, no no.  I'm just visiting my brother. I'm living in Seattle these days.  How about you, are you back in town?" "You were here and you didn't look me up?  Are we a little anti-social these days?"  Who's he kidding.  It's been almost 4 years since we stopped talking, why the hell would I look him up. I think not.  Not after all the guilt and the grief from his wife, well, actually she'd be his ex-wife now... But still...  "I suppose I am a bit anti-social, but I didn't actually know you were in town."   Because I would have gone somewhere else for lunch.  He just stands there and looks at me with a half smile on his face.   He's trying to think of something witty to say, isn't he.  Then he's going to say we should keep in touch, and offer me his cell number for when I'm in town next.  He'll suggest we go out for dinner sometime, or a beer.  That is possibly the worst idea.    "Well, it was nice seeing you.  Hope things are going well these days..." "Yeah, next time you're around visiting, you should...."  Shit! He's going to hug me goodbye!  I quickly stick out my hand to shake his, and brace myself for the worst.  He takes my hand, and stares at me.  The smile ebbing from his face.    Dammit!  I wish his eyes weren't so easy to read.  Is he quickly thinking of all the things he's wanted to say?   I pull my hand free of his, and I realize that I felt nothing.  Finally after all these years, I feel nothing. "Have fun, kay?" He stares at his hand, "Yeah.  You too.  See you around." I turn away, and quickly walk to the car where my family is waiting.   "He's still standing there looking at you, Wussy," my brother tells me as he peers over my shoulder. "I know, I know.  Lets just drive." "I saw him the other night at the bar." My mom looks inquisitive, "Did you go say, 'hi' to him, Bret?" "No."  My brother looks at me out of the corner of his eye.  "It's more like we just know of each other."

      I think it's a requirement for membership to the human race to create one of these lists at least once.

      This morning, I actually woke up to the warmth of little bitty rays of sunshine on face.  That puts me into such a nice mood.  Its like the sun can't be stopped by the shades on the window and will seep in to greet me any way that it can. (Eleven hours of sleep does great things for my disposition as well.)  Ah.  Now if only I had a Starbucks barista in my kitchen making me my non-fat, sugar-free vanilla latte, the world truly would be a perfect place.  Well, for me anyway. I can't really speak for you guys, but it'd be damn good for me.

       6:05am    Wake up.  Shower. Dress for classes this morning.   7:08am    No emails from Dad.  Hmm.  That's strange.  He must be out running errands for work.   1:24pm    Phone call from Lisa  (friend/intern at grandfathers law firm.)   "Tara!  Are you ok?!" "Yeah, why wouldn't I be?  I'm just getting ready to go to my last class." "...Hang on....* audible whisper * ...Do me a big favor and call your grandmother right now." "I'd prefer not too, if it's all the same to you.  Tell me whats going on." "...* whisper *...it's nothing, just call your grandma." "Lisa, knock it off.  What's going on?" * conversation continues. Sastifactory lie is fabricated to veil actual reason for call .  I never call my grandmother.  Inuitive alarm to the quiet wrongness of the world never goes off.   2:05pm    I leave a few minutes early for late afternoon Law and Ethics class.   2:25pm    Try not to daydream about weekends plans in Seattle.  Try to pay attention to lecture.  Nap through class instead.     4:45pm    Walk home.    5:02pm    Door to landing is open.  I never leave it open. Heart pounds.   Burglary?   Race up steps to apartment. "Hello?!  Wuss?  Who's There?!"   5:03pm   Apartment door is also open, and I burst into kitchen.  Greeted by a red-faced, very somber Uncle, who stands in kitchen dressed in suit and tie, obviously coming right from work. "Oh, Hi Uncle Pat."  Relief.  "Did Bret let you in?" "Sweetheart...It's your dad." "What are you talking about?" Blood rushes to head.  Ears feel full of water, can't hear.  Pulse is galloping towards heartattack.  Legs tremble.  "Whatshappened?Whereishe?!Ishehurt?"  Try to push past uncle towards rest of apartment. Representative for CDA sheriffs department steps in my way.   5:07pm   Tears run down uncle's cheek. "Honey, your dad died this morning...* continues to speak *  Can't hear anything more.  Breathing quick.  Headache coming on.  Push past uncle towards living room.   5:09pm   Manage to swim through the thick air to living room.  Bret sits in recliner with head in hands, shoulders shaking.  Sounds are still murky at best. Voice breaks: "Wussy?..."   5:10pm   Bret rushes from chair, weeping stongly.   But Bret never cries.  He throws arms around my neck.  Hot tears are burning like acid through my t-shirt and scalding my skin.  I have all 6 foot, and 200lbs of my little brother hanging from my shoulders.  I don't think his feet are supporting any of his weight. I slowly lean forward and place my little brother back in the chair.  Hearing comes back in a tsunami of sound.   "Oh God..."  The thunder of my own words rips through my skull.   5:20pm   Like the Miller that I've been groomed to be, I spin away and dash to bedroom.  Things need to be taken care of.  There is more sense in movement.  Keys?   Check.   Phone?  Check.   Wallet?  Check.   Contacts?  Check.  Clothes? ... quickly fill backpack .   Check.   Toothbrush?  Check.   I storm past; Uncle, cousin, random guy, and brother.     5:31pm   I run down the stairs, throw backpack into car, and jam keys in ignition.  It takes 7 attempts.   I have got to get to Dad .  Car starts. What's that noise? Oh.  Driver door is still open.  Uncle puts hand on my shoulder.   "Oh, honey. I'm so so sorry...."   5:35pm   My world officially shatters.     5:36pm   My eyes burst like grapes, in my eye sockets.  Or at least thats the way it feels.  Possibly because I've managed to get all ten fingerpads to jam inbetween brow bone, and cheek bone.  The high pitched whine is coming from somewhere in my own throat.  And I'm not sure why my car isn't running,  and where the hell did my keys go?      Sometime after 5:35   All time looses its value.  And we all take the longest trip up to CDA that I've ever known.  Keith drives my car, as we follow Grandpa's white Cadi through the mountains of Highway 95 N.  We get passed by a logging truck.  That's never happened before. But there has to be a first time.  There is always a first time for every single event.

      "Maslow's hierarchy of needs was an alternative to the depressing determinism of Freud and Skinner. He felt that people are basically trustworthy, self-protecting, and self-governing. Humans tend toward growth and love. Although there is a continuous cycle of human wars, murder, deceit, etc., he believed that violence is not what human nature is meant to be like. Violence and other evils occur when human needs are thwarted. In other words, people who are deprived of lower needs such as safety may defend themselves by violent means. He did not believe that humans are violent because they enjoy violence. Or that they lie, cheat, and steal because they enjoy doing it.   According to Maslow, there are general types of needs (physiological, safety, love, and esteem) that must be satisfied before a person can act unselfishly. He called these needs "deficiency needs." As long as we are motivated to satisfy these cravings, we are moving towards growth, toward self-actualization. Satisfying needs is healthy, blocking gratification makes us sick or evil. In other words, we are all 'needs junkies' with cravings that must be satisfied and should be satisfied. Else, we become sick."   http://web.utk.edu/~gwynne/maslow.HTM   And that is all I will say about that.

       "Why do you expect anything from anyone?  Why did you expect a company to offer you a job? Why do you expect someone to be around to "care for you"? Why are you looking for someone else to make you happy?  I think you will find there are many people in your life who DO care for you. Maybe not in the relationship/sexual way you want, but in a very strong and caring way nonetheless.  Nothing in life is guaranteed or secure and no one has been promised anything. You are in a much better situation than others in the world right now and have every opportunity to make what you want of your life.   You have full use of your body. You have full use of your mind. You have incredible artistic and creative talents that many people work hard at trying to achieve and NEVER get there. You are living in a free country. In real terms,  you have no actual problems.  Stop sitting around waiting for someone or something. Stop crying. Realise what you have and make an effort to get what you want.  No one owes you anything at all. Anything given to you from anyone is a bonus.  And if someone is holding you back from moving on, cut them the fuck off."    some philosopher

      Today when I woke up, I realized that it was just going to be one of  those  days. And I've been proven right... A couple of times.  Anyway, in a worthless attempt to add some humor to a barf-bag of a day I offer you a documentation of the drunken stupidness of my brother. (Sorry, Wuss. But it's for a worthy cause.)  I should preface by telling you that my brother had to have all of this explained to him the next day.  My brother, being a professional consumer of fine alcoholic beverages, was escorted by his frattie brattie chums to the local pub. He and the 'Sigma-Nerds' proceeded to get wasted.  Really  wasted.  I assume that they only left the bar because they ran out of money, but who really knows. A few feet outside of the pubs entrance, my brother finds that a simple stroll home is too boring for a savvy adventurer like himself. So he runs. Actually, he sprints towards home.  Unfortunately, like most drunks, his coordination was a bit off. So, when a parked Van found itself directly in his path, Super Wussy had his wits about him enough to know that he wouldn't be able to dodge such a crafty adversary.  He ran over it. Bumper. Hood. Windshield. Then down the roof of the van. He finished his routine with a jump off of the back of the van with arms windmilling around his sides.  To the complete surprise of his chummy chums, (who were desperately trying to catch him,) he landed the jump. Apparently it received very high marks. "10. 10. 9.5. 8.0." As his expensively cushioned sneakers hit the ground, he took off running again.  He was reaching speeds more associated with jet planes than a pedestrian, and clouds of burnt sneaker sole were pluming into the air behind him. But faster he ran.  Sprinting down the sidewalk he quickly found a low hanging tree branch posing an immediate threat to his well being. He ducked. He dodged. He fell. Wuss found himself completely parallel with the ground. Or lying on it, if you will.  Laughter peeled through the night behind him as his chummies doubled over, red in the face, and trying not to wet themselves. When they composed themselves enough to catch up to him, they found him still lying on the ground.  He looked up at them, and with a look of complete sincerity he said  "Whoa. Gravity Storm."  More laughing ensued.  The next morning all of this was re-enacted for him. Mostly so that he could understand why he had giant road-rash scrapes on his legs and shoulder.   Oh, and Cheers , Wussy!

      When I was in Hawaii some woman gave me a free sample of perfume.&nbsp; I just smiled, stuffed it in my purse, and kept walking.&nbsp; It's been just sitting around for months, but yesterday I tested it out, and found I REALLY like it.&nbsp;   The funny part is, I don't like it as a perfume that I would wear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, no.&nbsp; &nbsp;It's not a scent that I want people to associate with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's more of a masculine cologne smell.&nbsp; It happens to smell very similar to the cologne that my dad used to wear.&nbsp; Which is why I like it.&nbsp; Very comforting.&nbsp;   Strange, yeah?

      "It is a really cute hampster.&nbsp; Nice choice."  "Thanks.&nbsp; I think I should name it 'Mokie'.&nbsp; Wasn't that the name of a fraggle off of that old muppet show?"  "Sure.&nbsp; Why not."  "Ok, you hold the box with the rat while I drive."  "Hey, do you want to grab some lunch?"  "Uh, yeah, but it'd have to be drive-through."  "Oh,...I think you're going to change your mind about that when you see the guy that just walked inside..."  "Damn.&nbsp; Ok, we'll go inside, but it has to be quick.&nbsp; I don't want this rodent roaming around my jetta."  "Don't worry about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll put my jacket over it."    20 minutes later and&nbsp;without the phone number of the really cute guy...    "Well, I would have gotten&nbsp;his number&nbsp;if I was wearing a low-cut shirt."  "Whatever.&nbsp; The Tara I know would have just walked up, smiled, and had him begging to give you his number.&nbsp; You've obviously lost your touch."  "Piss off."  "Uh,...Tara?"  "Yeah."  "I got some good news, and I got some bad news."  "How about I give you 30 seconds to give me all the news, or I make you walk your happy ass home."  "Ok, well the mouse is not in the box any longer.&nbsp; I can tell, you see, because of this mouse size hole that's been chewed out of the side of the box.&nbsp; But the good news is that it's probably still in the car somewhere."  "Are you shitting me?"  "I shit you not."  "Well, shit."    Quick search turns up nothing.    "Where the hell could a little mouse possibly have gone?"  "SHH!&nbsp; Be quiet..."  "Oh my god.&nbsp; It got into the vents."  "Well it needs to get the hell out, because I am not having a rat carcass decreasing the value of my car."  "Ok, well...My dad might still be at work.&nbsp; We could go to his&nbsp; car shop, and see if he can take it out."  "Ok.&nbsp; But lets just be sure to turn the heat off.&nbsp;&nbsp; No cooked rodents, please."    3 min later, while driving down a very busy Division St...    "Where do I turn?"  "Its right on the rig..."  "ARGH!!!"  "What?!&nbsp; What?!"  "ITS ON MY FOOT!&nbsp; It just flopped out of the dash onto my foot!&nbsp; Jesus, that scared the hell out of me!&nbsp; Grab it before it has a chance to get into anything else!"  "I can't reach!"  "Ok, hold the wheel and I'll grab it...."  "Car.&nbsp; Car!&nbsp; CAR!"  "Dammit, Tina!&nbsp; Hold the wheel!&nbsp; ...Ok, I got it.&nbsp; Here take this..."  "Don't throw the rat at me!"    Two days later that demon possessed rat had babies.

      God, this week has been so nice.&nbsp; Sleeping in everyday has been oh-so-beneficial.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've spent all weekend just cleaning my apartment, and lounging around.&nbsp;   Wait,...well, I did go out to dinner with an admirer earlier, but I got to be honest.&nbsp; It wasn't all that much fun.&nbsp; I mean, he's really cute, but I was seriously bored by the time our drinks arrived at the table.&nbsp; I think sometimes there's that connection, and sometimes there's not.&nbsp; What can I say.&nbsp; My batting average isn't that great.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I strike out more than anyone I know.   Anyway, my brother "Super-Wuss" came over for a visit a couple of days ago.&nbsp; When I say, "Visit" I mean that he came here because he found a car he wanted to buy, and I just happen to own a convenient place for him to crash for the night.&nbsp; But I had a really fun time hanging out with&nbsp;him.&nbsp;&nbsp; AND I nicked a couple of his humorous&nbsp;T-shirts.&nbsp; None of which are really appropriate for work.... not like that’s ever stopped me before.&nbsp;   The Wussy did bring me an&nbsp;unassembled model of a '68 Firebird, so I've been diligently working on that today.&nbsp; This car project is going to be a massively emotional&nbsp;one, I can tell.&nbsp;&nbsp;I get teary even as this model is taking shape.&nbsp; I just keep thinking about how much&nbsp;Dad would have loved working on the Firebird with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully,&nbsp;he still&nbsp;is, even if I can't see&nbsp;him.&nbsp; Today I painted the chassis, body, and added Dad's initials to the tail of the Bird.&nbsp; I also assembled the engine block.&nbsp; Seems kinda stupid to be gluing all of these little pieces in place that people will never be able to see, but if I'm going to do it, I'm going to fucking do it right.   Oh shit.&nbsp; The Simpson’s are on.&nbsp; &nbsp;Later

      Dating is a lot like... Little Red Ridding Hood ? &nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; &nbsp;This metaphor might take some fancy foot work, but we'll see where it goes.  &nbsp;  I'm a lot like Little Red.&nbsp; &nbsp;Only, the term 'little' doesn't describe anything about me.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I would  never  make such an atrocious mistake as to wear a red hooded cape. &nbsp; (Honestly, what was she thinking.)&nbsp;&nbsp; But it's the innocence that is the key similarity here.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Hey, it could be true!&nbsp; Stop laughing!... Anyway, like I was saying, we're both&nbsp;very inno...&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Innocent-ISH.  &nbsp;  I was just skipping along through the forest to visit Grandma, (who in this story will be played by Fhay, because I really only visit my Grandma if I absolutely have to.)&nbsp; Skip, skip, skipping along through the parking lot,...I mean Forest, all the while being stalked by the Big.&nbsp; Bad.&nbsp; Wolf.&nbsp; (Played by the boy in question.)&nbsp; The Boy, I mean 'Wolf"&nbsp;spends half of the story following me through the forest, trying to woo me by whispering in my cute little ears, but I'm oblivious, because the wind is whistling through the 8 rings in my ears.&nbsp; (That actually happens on occasion.&nbsp; Its very unnerving.)&nbsp; So, I continue to skip,...well, not so much skip, because I' probably wearing flip flops,... So let's say 'flopping' through the forest... Singing to myself.  &nbsp;  "I don't like Regae...Oh no!&nbsp; I love it!&nbsp; Yeah!"&nbsp; (What?&nbsp; You were expecting a sweet little "Tra la la la"?&nbsp;&nbsp;Me thinks not.)  &nbsp;  So the Sneaky Wolf, decides that he really likes a challenge,&nbsp;and he quickly trots to Grandma Fhay's house.&nbsp; But the good news is that Fhay wasn't home...&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I don't know where she was, because she rarely leaves a note.&nbsp; Anyway, Mr. Wolf lets himself in and quickly adjusts his appearance so that "Mr. Wolf" becomes "Mr. Hottie Pants",&nbsp;and he&nbsp;sits quietly waiting for semi-innocent Red to come to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...You've got to admit, it's a damn good move.&nbsp; I've never been able to really get it to work myself.&nbsp; Mostly because I have a pretty short attention span, but a damn good move nontheless.  &nbsp;  "Stupid flip flops.&nbsp; Can't skip at all in these&nbsp;damn shoes."&nbsp; And I,&nbsp;(playing &nbsp;'Little Red' in this fabrication)&nbsp;flip and flop up to the door.&nbsp;&nbsp; I quickly knock twice.&nbsp; The door swings open, and there is Mr. Wolf,&nbsp;looking&nbsp;oh-so-sexy, holding a dozen roses&nbsp;and whispering the sweetest things.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It's at this point that the fable is going to need a bit of a tweak or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  "My, what big eyes you have... And a really nice butt.&nbsp; Yowza!. "  &nbsp;  Blah, blah, blah.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, the conversation goes on, because it's so entertaining.&nbsp; And I completely neglect to notice the great big teeth Mr. Wolf is sporting.&nbsp; I walk in, and BAM!&nbsp; The sweet talk ends, and I find myself on the receiving end of Wolfish sarcasm.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Happens every time.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~&nbsp;  ...Wow, that turned out much better than I thought it would.&nbsp;&nbsp; That metaphor&nbsp;worked perfectly, didn't it.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, those two stories are almost identical.&nbsp; Damn.&nbsp; I'm good at this!&nbsp; Tomorrow we discuss "Hanzel and Gretel" as a metaphor for the American work place.

      I don't have much to tell you about, Kiddies.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  -I really like waking up AFTER the sun has risen.&nbsp;   -I took a boat trip to Victoria B.C. with my parents this weekend, and saw about 20 orcas flopping around making a spectacle of themselves.&nbsp;

       What is it that is really attractive in another person?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Some girls really subscribe to the "bad boy" stereotype.&nbsp; The motorcycles and fast cars. The tattoos and the piercings.&nbsp; The wild hair.&nbsp; The "I don't give a fuck what you think" attitude.&nbsp; I'll admit, I've fallen for the occasional bad boy, because let's face it.&nbsp; Confidence, (even if misplaced) is sexy.  But it never works out.&nbsp; Because that "I don't give a fuck what you think" attitude usually means that they don't, in fact, give a fuck what you think.  &nbsp;  There's also the 'Mr. Sensitive' stereotype, which in my humble opinion is over used bullshit.&nbsp; I think that one of two things happen with the "Mr. Sensitive".&nbsp; 1) They're just quite or&nbsp;shy, thus being mistaken for mysterious, or a sensitive thinker.&nbsp; Or 2) They're going out of their way to act sensitive and caring, because someone told them that that's what girls want.&nbsp; It's crap either way.&nbsp; I doubt that most people develop&nbsp;sensitivity, and a caring attitude&nbsp;towards another until they've&nbsp;known them for awhile.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have found myself being drawn more to a guys voice than his appearance.&nbsp; Mostly because a person can dress to portray whatever they want, but they can't hide in their voice.&nbsp; I'm not talking about the tone, or accent behind a voice, because everyone&nbsp;has a different opinion on that.&nbsp; But If you listen carefully you can pick up on the genuine person.&nbsp; You can hear their pride, intelligence, ego, sincerity, affection, insecurities, motivation, ignorance, sarcasm, irritations, restlessness, and their desire.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   SO, if a guy is a cocky son of a bitch, you'll hear it.&nbsp; If he's laid back with a good sense of humor, you'll hear it.&nbsp; If he's happy with life, you'll hear it.&nbsp; If he's lying, you'll hear it.&nbsp; If&nbsp;he's comfortably being himself,&nbsp;you'll hear it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he's just saying what&nbsp;he thinks you'd want to hear, you'll hear it in his voice.&nbsp; &nbsp;If he's a whiney bastard, you'll definitely hear it.&nbsp; If you need help figuring it out, then simply listen to him laugh.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  A really good voice is the audio equivalent to walking in from the rain, and curling up in front of the fireplace with a cup of cocoa.&nbsp; It should be able to peel you off the ceiling with just a couple of syllables when you're freaking out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its whisper should give you goose bumps.&nbsp; &nbsp;It should be one of&nbsp; the most comforting sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be able to make you smile like a muppet with just a 'Hello'.&nbsp; &nbsp;It should be the biggest turn on, and the sweetest kiss.&nbsp; It definitely should never make you cringe.  &nbsp;  Oh, and guys,&nbsp;this all goes for girls as well.&nbsp; Only girly&nbsp;voices are even&nbsp;even easier to read.

      After the New Employee Orientation that the Professor and I suffered through I promptly picked up my new little blue ID badge, gassed up the Jetta and headed to meet my mom for a late afternoon lunch. My mom was the president of the Pacific Northwest Human Resources chapter, so I was sure to arm myself with the black box containing all of my benefits, 401k, and stock information.  Oh, I also toted along the complimentary coffee mug with the company logo.  (If anything would prove that I was now a valued employee, the mug surely will.  They don't just hand those out to anybody, you know.)  I was ready.  ...Or at least I thought I was, but you can bet that there were questions beyond my ability to answer.  "Do they match everything you make in the 401k?" "I uh..." "Did they provide you a list of doctors if you decide to go with Group Health?" "It's umm..." "What about vision?  Does Group offer the vision, or is it through someone else? Is the coverage any good?" "Well, it's uh..." "When are your shares vested?" "I think it's um... Hey.  Did I show you my coffee mug?" "That's nice, Sweetheart.  Well, from what I can see they really take care of their employees.  Some of this stuff is better than what we offer our employees."  The analytical look starts to slide away from her eyes, and the corners of her mouth turn up. "You did it, Honey." "Am I a success?" "Of course, Sweetheart." "Am I a 'Grown Up'?" "Let's not push it."

      This exclamation was screamed at me as my car winded through the extensive apartment complex that I live in.  After being mildly surprised that someone other than myself was a native English speaker, I scoffed at the idea that someone would go out of their way to embarrass themselves like that.  As I continued to drive past, I said what you may be thinking right now.  "Trash."  Normally I would just continue with my judging ways and assume that I am, of course, superior to all.  But I've been thinking about my Firebird dilemma quite a bit lately, and it occurred to me... "Wait.  My  'White Trash Index' could be considered quite high."  So, please allow me to get off my pedestal for a moment, and display for you, faithful reader, my white trash qualities. Hopefully, this irresponsible display will alleviate some of my shame.  -I was born in the Snake River Valley, where teenagers live it up by country swing dancing, spitting tobacco, and cow-tipping.  -I own a '68 firebird, which won't loose it's Flaming Chicken status until its pretty close to being mint.    -My brother and I also own a '74 Ford F-250.  If you're wondering, its 'Aztec Gold' and liberally spattered with rust.  Not to mention, it happens to be sporting some mighty glass packs, and used to have a gun rack.  I kid you not.  -There is a pair of cowboy boots in my closet right now.  -I have nine rings in my ears, although I think that makes me a different kind of trash...  -Within the last week, I've used the phrase "It was funnier than ALL GET OUT" as well as the word "Rig."   -I'm listening to "Lynyrd Skynyrd" this very moment.  -I've crushed a MGD beer can on my forehead. (Ya' see, there's a trick to it.  You've got to dent the side of the can just slightly with your thumb before you smush it to your head.)  -I also spent a few summers as a kid hanging out at a horse ranch, where I learned to ride, and chew on hay.  -I've been to a bluegrass concert. Where they didn't have anything as fanshy shmanshy as 'Dr. Pepper.'  -I was proud to meet a bull rider.    I'm not trying to imply that all cowboy behavior indicates 'white trash' because there are a lot of other qualities not mentioned.  It's just a generalization, if you will.  Dammit.

      Ok, so I may have a couple of sneaky skills up my sleeve when it comes to finding a persons phone number, or address.  But today, I found myself at a complete loss.    The gentleman that I bought the firebird from neglected to sign the title before sending it with the car. I'm assuming that he's never bought or sold a car before and wouldn't know better.    Or   possibly, space aliens have been doing a lot more than anal probes to the red necks down in Texas, and have left him with no intelligence to speak of.  Either scenario is plausible.    In order to get the car titled I have to send him a few forms to sign.  No big deal, right?  Wrong.  This little bastard has disappeared off the face of the earth.  None of the contact information I have for him is correct any longer.  His business?  Gone.  His phone numbers?  Disconnected.  Is there even a person with the same name in that city?  Nope.  Not to mention, I was told by another victim of the aliens evil plot for butt information, (logically employed by the DMV) that without some sort of signature I cannot title the car.  She said "There is nothing you can do."  Damn aliens should have just let her drop back to earth without a parachute.  So, at this point I'm at a bit of a loss.  I have this doodah's old address, but have found no way to find his forwarding address.  My only idea is to call the post office near his old address and see if they'll give me a new address.  Any other suggestions from you little hackers?

      The Islanders have voted, and I'm  NOT  being cast off the island! ...I mean office.    "Well, I got to tell ya'.  The race was pretty intense there towards the end.  I thought I was a goner in the last stretch of the interviews.  The competition can be pretty charismatic.  But, I said to myself, 'SO AM I!' And I just dug down deep and gave it all I had.  And I won.  So I'm feelin' pretty good about that."  I've only seen 'Survivor' once, so I can't remember how those idiots talk.  But anyway, I GOT THE JOB!  And if you don't know what I'm talking about THEN YOU CAN PISS OFF!

      I have a couple little treats for you cute wittle Minions.  I bring these wonderful gifts mostly because I've been moping around because of my estranged job status.  So in an offering of peace I bring you:  The musical stylings of  urlLink   Chickiboom  .  I believe it is referred to as "Musical Poetry."  And it is oh-so-nice when you've been self-medicating, if you will.  The second gift is for you  urlLink MoveOn.org  followers out there interested in wearing your world views on your body.  For you I have  urlLink  Sovereingntee .   Yeah!  T-shirts Gallore!  I personally like the 'Mad Cowboy Disease' T-shirt.  (Caleb promises that the site will be up by sometime today, so if you are having troubles browsing through the catalogue, then keep checking back!)  You guys will really love these.

       urlLink This  is funny.  I'm not going to copy and paste the whole thing for you, but I highly suggest you check it out.    Oh, and I totally agree in regards to thongs.  The stupid things are pointless.  Girls, if you're worried about panty lines, then don't bother wearing anything at all.  It saves the rest of us from having to watch you pick your wedgie, as well as limiting the view of your t-backs hanging out the top of your low-rider pants.  It's not sexy.  It makes you look seriously masochistic.  Not that I'm an advocate for granny panties, or anything...  Oh, nevermind.  I've had my say.

      I have a confession. I'm developing a little bit of a crush here at work. I've seen this cutie wandering around the place, and being the gutless coward that I am, I've only managed to follow him around from a distance. What can I say! I don't like asking guys out. I've done it a few times, and frankly that was enough for me thankyouverymuch.  The first time I asked a guy out, we damn near ended up getting married.  The second time we went out for a few meals, a movie, and then I couldn't get rid of him.  The third time I got rejected outright. I know, I know. I couldn't believe it either, but it's true.  So I'm not doing it anymore! I think I'm just going to slink around corners and try to look like I'm on an important errand to see if I run into Mr. QT again. Who knows. Maybe I'll even talk to him someday.  Right. And Ryan Reynolds is stalking ME now. Sure.

      Well Kids, it's done.  The monstrous Ford f-250, (affectionately referred to as "Old Gold") that was my dad's prized vehicle has been sold. This truck symbolizes my dad and everything he was in this life. Dependable. Rough around the edges. Determined. And a bit growly. He had it since before I was born, and happily abused it for the next 27 years. Even Jebzilla (monster dawg) recognizes the sound of the glass packs rumbling down the road.  I don't know how many times I've gone careening out of the house to jump into the back of the truck as it was about to drive away. ...What can I say? It was bound to be an adventure if Dad was taking the truck. Not to mention that learning how to drive the Truck was the most accomplished I have ever felt in my life... thus far.  "How do you know so much about cars, Dad?" "The Truck used to break down a lot." "Why did the truck break down so much?" "Because I used to worked on it a lot." "Ah. Gotcha."  -It's been destroyed and rebuilt so many times, that it openly defies the idea of mortality. -It's had very large trees dropped on it, and was tough enough to drive home without crying. -It's pulled many unlucky cars out of ditches. -It's laughed at perilous snow storms as it plowed through, completely unphased. -It's hauled more furniture then any stupid U-haul van. (Most of which was mine.) -It helped to convince the world of its superiority in the "Chevy's vs. Fords" competition. -It's been stuffed with so much wood, and yard debris that the leaf springs have seen their lives pass before their eyes on numerous occasions.   IT. WAS. UNSTOPPABLE.   And now its just rusts out at our lake cabin, developing its own little collection of pine-needles. I certainly don't want to get rid of such an important piece of memorabilia, but I don't have much choice. I really don't have a use for it, and I kinda think Dad would want someone else to beat the shit out of it, instead of just letting it sit.  So off it goes. Hopefully to a good home. On a farm. With lots of hauling to do.

      I've got nothing really to tell you wittle minions about, so I'll give you a savory little taste of my favorite poet.   View with a Grain of Sand   By Wislawa Szymborska, Selected Poems (Nobel Prize for Literature)     Love At First Sight       They're both convinced    that a sudden passion joined them.   Such certainty is beautiful,   but uncertainty is more beautiful still.      Since they'd never met before, they're sure   that there'd been nothing between them.   But what's the word from the streets, staircases, hallways--      I want to ask them   if they don't remember--   a moment face to face   in some revolving door?   perhaps a "sorry" muttered in a crowd?   a curt "wrong number" caught in the receiver?   but I know the answer.   No, they don't remember.      They'd be amazed to hear    that Chance has been toying with them    now for years.      Not quite ready yet   to become their Destiny,   it pushed them close, drove them apart,   it barred their path,   stifling a laugh,    and then leaped aside.      There were signs and signals,   even if they couldn't read them yet.   Perhaps three years ago   or just last Tuesday   a certain leaf fluttered from one shoulder to another?   Something was dropped and then picked up.   Who knows, maybe the ball that vanished    into childhood's thicket?    There were doorknobs and doorbells   where one touch had covered another   beforehand.   Suitcases checked and standing side by side.   One night perhpas, the same dream,    grown hazy by morning.    Every beginning   is only a sequel, after all,   and the book of events,   is always open halfway through.

      She's got horribly cute puppy pictures on her site today, Kids. I highly suggest you give the 'fhayzzer' link a whirl.  I finished the Firebird model this morning. I say that with an underlying tone of accomplishment, but now that I read back I realize how pathetic I am. I skipped out on going to the International Brew Fest with friends yesterday because all I wanted to do was to glue my fingers together, and get paint on my shirt while I piece together a model of a '68 Firebird. Something's just not right with that. Either way, I'm horribly proud of this wad of plastic posing as a car. It doesn't look that great. Some dastardly glue snuck it's way onto one of the windows, and there's a fingerprint or two on the body's paint job, but I love it. It makes me want to start work on the lonely Firebird that is begging to be driven, but can't until it gets titled. I'm seriously considering forging the Mr. Dillhole's signature so that "Firebird Restoration 2004" can commence. In case you're wondering  urlLink this  is what a well loved Firebird should look like.  I'm getting the impression that my boss think's I'm retarded. Ok,... To be fair, he's only about half wrong. I think a couple of my highly sarcastic comments have been taken literally. Which is SUCH a bad thing. Matt's constantly telling him that I was dropped on my head as a child, which really doesn't help matters much either. All's fair in Pranks and Taunts, but I really would like to do some cool things with this job, or at the very least somehow manage to keep it. All I have to do is try not to run with scissors, and avoid programming a VCR, and I'll be money, Baby.
