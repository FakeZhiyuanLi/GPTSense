      Hey gang!!! Whoa! Sorry for the lackage of postage here. I'm definitely doing a lot better since my recent post. I've decided to just let that stuff go and not give it too much thought. I went to see Without a Paddle tonight, and I must say, it doesn't even compare with Harold Kumar. I give Without a Paddle two really fat thumbs down. So as you all probably know, school starts in about a week or so and I'm not sure how I feel about that. It may be for the good, and it may be for the bad. I guess we'll just see. I noticed at work today that when people swipe their credit cards, they tend to whip their arms out to their sides when doing so. It got me thinking, does it really take THAT much effort to swipe a tiny little piece of plastic? I don't know, it kind of upsets me to watch. But anyway...random thoughts, randoms thoughts. What else can I babble about? I'm wearing this sweater right now, and it's super itchy. I know, I know, why not just take it off? Welllll, because I'm too damn lazy. Tomorrow is going to be super boring, seeing as how I have to sit my ass at the house all day until my dad's phone arrives via "the delivery guy." Yeah, its gonna bite the big one. I figure I'll sleep in until the dude arrives and answer the door in my pj's, hair all messed up...lookin like a real nice piece of work...hehe. Well, I'm bored. Night everyone.   ~Later Days

      Hey guys. It's me again. My night didn't exactly end the way I wanted, but it got me thinking about the kind of person I am and how I choose to deal with things. I can't even begin to describe the whirlwind of emotions that I'm feeling right now. Angry. Sad. Frustrated. Confused. Unhappy...and that's just to name a few. I want to change the way I deal with things with all my heart...and I try so hard, but it just turns out the same way. It's harder than it looks. I mean, I can say I'm going to change how I act, but then I have to go ahead and do it. I'm having trouble with the "do" part. Tonight just erupted every little emotion that I have in my body. The question that I need to ask myself is, what do you do when one of your friends (or so I think) brings out the worst in you? Do you ditch them? Do you just suck it up and stick with 'em? I mean, I care about this person, but honestly, I'm positive the feeling isn't mutual. So I'm probably just wasting my time trying to achieve a happy medium. With this person, it seems to me there is no happy medium, no matter how hard I look. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack. I'm getting really tired, emotionally that is, of trying my hardest to please. Everything I have ever done and ever will do is doomed to be insignificant. But I guess that's life. Some things work out, and some things don't. Unfortunately, this is one of the things that didn't. I'm sorry for ever caring and I'm sorry for all the wrongs I've said and done.    ~Night

      Hey kiddies! Wow, sorry about the lack of entry there yesterday. I didn't return to mi casa until 1:00 A.M. I was going to post, but then I got to thinking, well it's already 1:00 A.M., and that technically is the next day, so I just decided to post in the morning when I awoke. So I went to see Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. If you like sick, disgusting, repulsive, and gut busting funny movies, this is the movie for you. With squirting blood, bullets, puss infested boils, chics with no shirts, and an ass load of weed, which is the center of the movie, I give it four thumbs up! So today is a beautiful day, picked up the old paycheck today, do that every Friday. Got some cash and filled my four cylinder ford focus up with 16.78 dollars worth of gas. Guys are always like, oooh! I have a V6 or V8 or Hemi, or whatever the hell kind of engine is bigger than mine, and they brag about it. It's like hey! I like my econo car, thank you very much, cuz when you retards are putting 25, 30 bucks in your car, my car fills up with less than 20. Sorry guys, I just had to make that statement. Anywho, my friend Alana just called and it looks like we're going on the Skyscraper again tonight! w00t!! I'm definitely excited, I love that ride. But as of now, I have nothing to do...maybe one of these, that certain someone will come around and agree to hang out with me for awhile. It'd be fuuuun! Yeah, whatev. I'm out!    ~Later Days

      Hey all. The weather sucks and I have nothing to do. This kind of weather makes me sit in my basement and think. And when I think, I just tear myself down and I get sad for absolutely no reason. I'm watching a commercial for one of those anti-depressants and I sometimes wonder if maybe I need some of those. So I ask myself these questions (the ones shown on t.v. also): Numero Uno: Do I sometimes feel sad for no apparent reason? "Yes, like every other day" Okkk...thats one strike. Numero Dos: Do I get stressed out about little things? "Of course, my life revolves around that shit." Well Kels, that's strike two. One more and you'll be a grade A looney. Numero Tres: Is the way you are feeling affecting how you act towards others? "Why yes, yes I do believe so, seeing as how I seem to be in fights a lot with people." Well, need I say more? Sometimes I just get so upset over stupid little things that I just blow up and I get all anti-social. Yeah. Not cool. At all. Am I just a moody teenager or do I seriously have a problemo? Hmmm....well, I have alllll night to think about it.     ~Later Days

      I'm full of regret For all the things that I have done and said And I don't nkow if it'll ever be ok to show My face 'round here Sometimes I wonder if I disappear  Would you ever turn your head and look See if I'm gone Cause I fear...  There is nothing left to say to you That you wanna hear That you wanna know I think I should go The things I've done are way too shameful  You're just an innocent A helpless victim of a spider's web And I'm an insect Going after anything that I can get So you'd better turn your head and run And don't look back Cause I fear...  There is nothing left to say To you That you wanna hear That you wanna know I think I should go The things I've done are way too shameful  And i have done you so wrong Treated you bad Strung you along Oh shame on myself I don't know how I got so tangled up                                                    -Maroon 5  This is by far one of my favorite songs by them. If you don't have their cd, I would highly suggest buying it. Songs about Jane is a really unique and beautiful album.

      Well, here I sit...another rainy day in Baraboo. It seems like this summer went by fast, and on top of that, it was one of the rainiest, which made for a boring summer. I woke up at 11:30 today and I looked out the window only to find gray clouds and sprinklings of water on my car. Sad. I was in for another...long...boring...day. I almost called into work to see if they needed me...lol...I rarely do that. I've been wanting to see The Assistant on MTV because I heard its pretty funny. I called up my friend and she told me it was on at 3:00. I was like "Yesss!!!"...aaaaand, I looked down at my computer screen and the clock said 4:00...damn, that hurt. I never know when things are on TV. It seems like I always miss 'em by a hair. And as you can see up there, I lose track of time a lot when I'm bored. If I look at the clock it just makes the day longer. So, I don't look at the clock and I guess the time by daylight. Old fashioned way. I like old fashion. I like Old Fashion Days in downtown Baraboo. It's special. You're special. Everyone who reads this is special. Mhmmmmm. Anyway, I think I'll scamper off and frolic in my basement...whatever that means.   ~Later days

      Hey gang!!! Today was a good day. Had fun with the girls at work. Got off work at 7:30 and called up my friend Alana. She just got a new Mustang by the way, at let me tell you, that thing had power. We took it up to the Dells and cruised for awhile. And then we decided to go on the Skyscraper. For those of you who don't know what that is, it is an awesome f'in ride. It was like 60 degrees out so we were freezing...we got stuck at the top and had a beautiful view of the Dells at night...just somethin about it that was so relaxing...but at the same time I was shaking violently due to the fact that I knew the fall that awaited me. Mmm...the Dells. Then we smoked some guys in her Mustang that she just happened to know and sadly, I declined their little get together tonight. That was my day/night...hope you enjoyed my rambling.   ~Later Days

      Hello all you hoolagins out there. I had an interesting day today. Although every day working at that hellish place is quite interesting. I had a couple come through my line today and they were hilarious. The man referred to his wife as "Tooty" and they both had funny little accents. It made me laugh and also annoyed at the same time. I bought beef jerky today. It was good. My internet is being insanely stupid today, and every other day, so therefore, this entry is gonna look dumb becase it wouldnt let me use red or the font arial...Whatev, Im outtie...gotta workin in the mornin and before I go to bed, I gotta get me some chili. Night folks.    ~Later Days

       Hey there kids! The name's Kelsie, but people call me Kels. I live in a small hick town with about 10,000 people...half of them being of the, how shall I say this...elderly persuasion? We have a circus too! Yes ladies and gentlemen, a circus. Exciting. Anywho, thats a just a little background. Here is my story for the day. I woke up this morning at five 'o' clock and ate a cookie. It was pretty good. Then I woke up at 9:30 and decided that I should clean my car out. Now, we have this old Shop Vac that is kinda dusty and smelly and just all around retarded, but it's all we had so I had to use it. As i was vacuuming, the tube disconnected and came off, leaving this huge gaping hole where EVERY SINGLE PARTICLE OF DUST I JUST vacuumed up from my car escaped and created this huge billowing cloud of dust right in my face...Well, to say the least, I wasn't too happy, but, such is life. Anywho, gotta go into work today and pick up the ol' paycheck and then off to the car wash! The song of the day today is Broken, by Seether ft. Amy Lee from Evanescence. It is a beautiful song and if you havent heard it, download it...now! And with that note, I think I will end my very first blog entry...woo hoo!    ~Later Days
