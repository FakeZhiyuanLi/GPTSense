        Hmm...it's been a while since I ever use a blog again. Kind of lose the last blogger that I used last time. Hehe, never mind. Shall start over again.  Haiz..today is the "Meet Parents' Day". And of course, i'm included. (as usual though coz almost everybody else have to go) Miraculously, my father decided to sent me n my mother to school...(it is unusual of him to do that, since he always prefers staying at home and sleep all his want since it is a day off for him as it's the holidays for the students, and he need not teach) Well, it's been raining ever since I woke up. And it only stops until now. The weather is kind of cool...pretty good for time to take a nap...Felt like cuddling up my pillow n goes to sleep..Haha. But alas! I've to go to school in such a weather. And redeem my results slip.  Cool as it is, bright as it seems...but there'isnt alot of students around that time...Guess every other students chooses a time as early as 10 to collect theirs...and only a couple of unlucky teens (like me) choose such a time where everyone is back at home, watching tvs and enjoying themselves...11.45 am is the time.   The first thing i saw when I entered the school...was DT! With 3 other pupils...Yep, all 3 of them are from my class...Dont know what's up with them...and DT...As far as I know, they must have commited something wrong that DT wanted to see all 3 of them. And from their faces, they aren't looking kinda good. Trying not to be nosey, I dragged my mom to my class...where Mr Wong (my form teacher) is.   Well, guess we were the last ones to be seen...There's someone in there...someone familiar...Ok, it's my sort of father's sister's son. (Well, I dont know how to call it, a long-distance relative, maybe?) Anyway, he was there...together with his...erm mother. At first glance, I thought it was my aunt. but then again when they came out, it was not. It took about 15 minutes for them before they come out from that room. And when they came out, his mother greeted my mom. And then when we entered, the first thing mr Wong said wad "Your related one ar?" And I nodded...  And here it goes....my result slip. It doesn't looks pretty nice...I failed 2 subjects. Haiz...Oh well, guess I've to buck up for my final year..just like what I did last year! I aimed to get back my position for Top 10! Muahahahaha... I've noticed....I always get a pretty lousy results for Mid Year Examinations....and only when Final Year, then my results are of the better. This year, I'm not going to let my parents down either! Afterall, it's an important year! =D  Mr Wong goes on and on about how I can improve on it...and I'm determined to prove that I can do well...and I am made of something! Lolx.. He even suggested me to buy the Ten Year Series books to practise on. And oh yeah, he even asked for my home number...I sure hoped he won't call when I'm least expected. After all, I'm a good student!   Yawn...it's 3pm now..Guess I've got to stop. Today's kind of ok. I'm so bored with nothing to do now...Maybe I should go back on reading the comics...And I just can't wait for tomorrow! Haha, coz I'm going out to redeem the Jolin's Concert Tickets...Well let's hope that at least I could get them.   Laters!

      Haiz...today planning to go orchard to redeem my Jolin's Mini Concert tickets...Never know that there will be so many people redeeming it. I went out at noon...then when we reach there, it was around 1pm.. And when we got there..i am utterly shocked! There's already a LONG queue there...God, why am I always so 'sway'? But then, I was prepared for the worst...I knew even if i queue up together with the others, i definitely doesn't stand a chance....so, forget it. =[  And just to make myself feel better..I decided to catch a movie! Yep! And I wanted to watch the Day After Tomorrow..but Jiali wanted Shrek2...then we decided to see which movie comes first and decided on which one to watch. And in the end, Shrek 2 shows at 1.30pm and DAT is at 2pm...and I was like, "Oh man..." Then I started to begged her on watch DAT instead. Then after some convincing, hehehe, I finally talked her into watch Day After Tomorrow instead! (Woohoo~) JiaLi rulez!! (LOlx)  Anyway, as I was saying...we bought the tickets and we have about an hour's time before the movie starts so we went to isetan (which is just below the cinema) and shop around. Haha, we've been to many departments...and like I said, there's a doll which looks REALLy like Jiali! Muahahaha..(oops hope she isn't reading this)and I told her that and she totally disagress with me..  Anyway, we went to the stationary department and I finally found the BLACK shaker!! Hehehehehe!! Well, I know I am wasting money but this is the only way to make me feel better after the loss of the 2 tickets for the Jolin's concert. And time flies, it is almost 2pm when the shows going to start. So we decided to go and make the preparations (like buying popcorns...lolx) And then we finally entered the cinema.  Wow! The show's REALLy awesome! It's the best movie I ever watched!! And Jiali even wanted for the toilet...but i told her not to go. Coz if she were to leave her seat, at any point of time, it's gonna be another great scene that she missed! And finally she tolerate through the whole movie. And it's absolutely a nice movie! So stimulating and romantic(for some parts). Especially how the girl hugs Sam when he was freezing cold after coming up from basement. And the most thrilling part is when the HUGE WAVES of seawater came rushing down to the city! And everyone is running for help...except for the girl who tries to help the old lady getting back her passport...Then Sam came to her resuce...and they are safe and sound! It's really a cool movie!! Like whaT DT have said...Haha  After coming out of the theatre, the first thing we did was rush to the toilet! And God! we didnt even manage to finish the popcorn! We left about 1/2 of the popcorns..coz both of us were to full to continue eating. And after sometimes, I keep talking to her that how great the movie is! And I am SO proud of myself that I told her to watch DAT instead of Shrek! Hehe, no la. Just kidding...lolx  Anyway, later we went over to heeren and planning to go over there and do some shopping..But then as I passed by popular, i decided to stop by and buy a couple of assesment books for myself. Coz my grades really have gone down! And I must do something about it this June Holidays!! Haiz...that means it's still looks like schooling for me...  After that, we went over to heeren...and on the way, jiali stomach pain...Told her to go toilet first liao, she dun listen..Like I always said "Whenever you need a toilet you cant find one, whenever you dont need one, it keeps appearing" And I was absolutely right about this! She refused to go at first, and when we walked half way and about to heeren, she suddenly stomach pain! Then she say she can't stand it and have to go for the toilets. And luckily we reached there and she took quite a while before she comes out. And I was starting to get bored too, lolx!   Finally, we went to HMV...I was looking for the Marykate and Ashley's VCD..hoping that the price will go down. But instead, the VCD is gone! Haiz...sway lor..I guess. Then forget it, we headed for the bus and went back to BukitMerah Interchange to buy me and my mom's dinner. And then we went back home.  Oh yeah! I forgot that I need to buy the Lime Magazine where this month features quite a lot of my favourite people in it! Great! Really sway ar, today!!! Forget it!  Haiz...  Oh well, me go have dinner liao...  Laters!!

      Wahhhh!! I cant believe I am SOoO unlucky! Remember yesterday I said that I was going to Orchard to redemm my tickets? Well, yeah indeed! There's leftovers for the tickets in the hello! shop. I got the news from an email sent by my online friends. They said that they came even at 4 something(which was the time when I went there again the second time)and they could redemm the tickets without fear! Argh!!  I thought with such a queue, surely the tickets have been out like hotcakes! But no! And worst of all, they can choose whatever they want! Not according to the amount of people! And most of the people chooses other merchandise like the DVD and posters and the passes. That's why there's so many leftover tickets! But then again, when I read on with the email, I realize something! No wonder the people don't want the tickets! If they had the tickets, they have to apply for a new line! And that means they have to spend more money for a pair of tickets,and it is not worth it at all! That's why almost everyone want something else!  Geez, now that I know the truth about it,I wasn't that upset over it. Coz even if I got the tickets, I couldnt have gone to the concert without applying for another line. Moreover, I've already got the DVD..I dont see why I need another one. And for the passes, erm I dont kinda have the time to queue up with those fans to get just the autograph of Jolin! So, I think I will pass up that too! Lastly, for the LIMITED edition Poster...it's kind of waste though..But still then again, even if i got the poster, i would just throw it one side like the poster doesn't exist. So, after all these serious thinking, I wasn't THAT depress on them.   Afterall, the best thing is, I've had a wonderful time in Orchard! That's the most important thing...                                      ************   Oh yeah! I got the news from a friend in the japanese exchange program that May and her partner got a tiff over something. Ha! Serve May right! (Hey, I'm not being mean here. But she really deserve that! Since she've been acting all the while! Trying to be teacher's pet. Though she still failed. And always acting cute! I can't stand people of this kind!) And god, she even cried! (Muahahahahaha!!!) My friend did absolutely the right thing! Ha! Know what she did? She actually treat my friend as HER maid! She kept ordering her to do things for her when my friend herself needed to do her own. And she even wanted my friend to help her keep her dirty clothes while she bathe! How could she! And that's not her first time, according to my friend. That's why my friend could tolerate no more and quarrel with her! (Good job! Hehe!)  And she even dare to complained all that to E and A (shortforms..) Then they told my friend about it. That's how she learnt that. And for 2 solid days, whenever May wanted to talk to my friend, she ignored her. (Wee!! Way to go!!)I bet May definitely doesn't have a good time in japan! Hahahaha!! That's something glad to hear. And to think she was still looking so forward to it! This should teach her a lesson!   Oh well..I've to go now..Going to catch my favourite tv shows.. Lolx  Laters!!

       Ugh! I'm damn sway...Havent been writing for awhile lately eh? Haha   Early in the morning, go down the road to hop on my father's car, and nearly tripped on a couple of 'invisible' stones! It is camouflage in the grass by the way...that's why I didnt notice it. And somehow it is still early and of 'coz the sun hasn't risen and neither could I see clearly...That's how, I almost fell...  Luckily I regain my balance as soon...and my father also grabbed me just in time (My knight in shiny armor) Lolx... Well, first thing in the morning nearly tripped...What more comes next? Yeah, I know there's bound to be loads more install for me! And I was quite right if you ask me!  When I got to school...everything was still allright until the last 2 periods! First was the Chinese, our Chinese teacher told us that we're not allow to use the dictionary 'coz we already know what's coming out for the test, so she forbid us from using it. And then she didnt turn up today for our test, but the test still is carried out somehow, with another teacher of course. And fair enough, we got the same topic and (hehe I've memorise everything, though I've changed some of the words 'coz I can't seem to remember all...OoPs) I started it quickly...'coz we dont have much time after we came back from the Com Lab...and it left us about 20 minutes to complete it instead of 35!  But half way through, the teacher told us we can use the dictionary! My mouth dropped open! I thought 'Didnt she told us we cannot use it? How come now can use??' Oh&nbsp; well, after all I've memorise most of them, there's no further need for me to get a dictionary now...since there isnt much to be look up in the dictionary. So I quickly finish the letter writing, and was the second to finish, but wasn't the second to hand it in...'Coz I dont want to hand up a piece of work with mistakes! So I counter check it.  Then, the teacher broke out the news that we are having another letter writing test on the upcoming Tuesday...and this time it is the formal type. And we are asked to learn the format ourselves. But as she is kind, she decided to go through with us on behalf of our teacher. And we were asked to stay back after school for 10 minutes to go through it...that wasn't so bad. But the worst has yet to come!  She decided to run to ask the HOD of Chinese Department whether she can ownself conduct the extra lessons with us and then when she ask whether she can trust us on not copying when she leaves...and she choose to trust us! I couldnt believe that! And when she left, everyone started to take out their papers and copy...until she came back. And everyone manages to finish it somehow...not all though. -_-"  Chemistry is the next lesson....I hate it! 'Coz that teacher totally sucks! He teaches so quickly and when students ask questions about it, he will yell at them! How weird! And he always like to pass sarcastic remarks on those he dislike! Thanks god, he dont dislike me...He actually treat my classmate a ghost! And he likes to give nicks to anyone he hates! And sway...when he tested us on the Equations, I got picked! 'Coz I was 16! And 15 didnt come! So he decided on 16! Then i go up, shaking....dont know what to write. I look around asking for help. Got some help from some of them, and then he decided that we can get help from someone...and if we cant complete it by today, all of us have to stay back!   Inorder to get everyone safely back home, I quickly ask the Chemistry Experts! True enough, I got the answers...but whether or not it's right he didnt say. But for the other team, he didnt got it right, and somehow have to stay back for detention. I thought he was going to say "Who was the other one that was up there, that couldnt answer the question just now?"(me) But I was standing there, praying hard he won't. And whew! He didnt!  I think he either forgotten about me or I really did get the right answers. Haha...  Kinda sway today right? But I cant wait for Sunday! 'Coz I'd be going to the library and borrow some cool books home..And I cant wait for Wednesday Night either! 'Coz my brother is coming back! And then, I can finally get my hands on the gifts he is bringing back! Hehe...I sure hope he got the things I like...  Okay.   Laters!!
