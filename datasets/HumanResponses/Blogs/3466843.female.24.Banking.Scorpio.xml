      Hi ... Posting after such a long time ... was a bit busy on Friday and then no office for the weekend and then yesterday was doing something and it was time to go home .... Was feeling so dull and bored yesterday that i postponed the plan for writing ne thing ... least boring other ppl ... ne ways ...  It rained cats and dogs here .. I mean it was raing water but still ;-)))) ne ways regarding this I heard the origin of the phrase raining cats and dogs ...  In old England people were not all so rich ... they used to stay in houses which had mud floors and in rainy season they used to put hay ( thresh) on it to avoid slipping ... In those days the cats and dogs and the cattle used to be kept on the roof made of mud and thrash again ... So now in rainy season it used to be very slippery on the top and the cattle could lose there footing and fall in side the house ... thus the saying that it was raining cats and dogs ... the trash on the ground also used to get to slippery and on opening the door it used to slip out of the house ... so the concept of tresh-hold (got the origin..)It is said that these ppl ued to cook in the same pot everyday i.e leave the leftover ovrenight and add somethings the next day and cook again ... weird na ....???? There was knee deep water at some places yesterday ... Hope the water reserves get full this monsoon and there is plenty of water for everybody this time ... it really pains to see some ppl wasting this divine potion at some places where as others strive to get a mug full ....  ne ways c ya for now ...  And a thought for today "Lets respect nature by using its resorces such that we leave something for the next generation to appreciate ..." - by Pallavi :-)
