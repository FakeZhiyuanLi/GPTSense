      Ok, after recieving enough of this, I want to put up a new rule.   If you plan on leaving a comment or sending me an email, speak English, godammit!   I'm getting rather sick of comments written in this fucked up gibberish that they try and call English.    hey im also a member of the c/a modertaing team ~Ne-Me-Of-Da-StAtE~ is my chat name and ikky is my forum name ....i agree that a few years ago b4 the site was so big we had alot less ppl flooding, swearing jus disrupting in general but since the site has become so big .... u cant expect not to get the good users with the bad thats wot mods are there 4....... well thanx 4 ur time  - Anonymous   That may appear to be English but it isn't to me. Lets see where Mr. Anonymous made mistakes    (Mistakes are highlited in bold)    hey   im  also a member of the c/a modertaing team ~Ne-Me-Of-Da-StAtE~ is my chat name and ikky is my forum name .... i  agree that a few years ago  b4  the site was so big we had alot less  ppl  flooding, swearing  jus  disrupting in general but since the site has become so big ....  u   cant  expect not to get the good users with the bad thats  wot  mods are there  4 ....... well  thanx   4   ur  time  - Anonymous  Goddammit. Those words he messed up on are all easy words to know and spell yet you have to lower my intellingence and be lazy by butchering and shortening words that are already easy enough to type out in their proper form. Look, half these words you decided to shorten only needed a few more keys pressed to be proper. Also, you screwed up on your punctuation. You forgot quite a few periods and you didn't capatilaise the first word in a few of your sentances. Wait, there's almost no capitals at all, anyway. Did you learn anything when you were in school? Hell, you're probaly still in school for all I know. Stop being so damn lazy and just finish up the word and stop typing like a idiot! Really. This isn't ChatAvenue, this isn't AIM and this isn't the land of illterate morons. When you send me a comment or email, speak  English . I'm not seeking out absolulte perfection in comments and emails sent to me but crap like this angers me and just makes the person submitting it look like an idiot. At least make an attempt to make your comment or email look decent. Stuff like this comment I get from this ChatAvenue Moderator doesn't look right.   Next comment or email I get thats typed in this stupid gibberish, I'm either just going to delete it or I'm just going to ridicule it like I'm doing with this one here. I'm sorry but the gibberish speak just looks stupid. Cut that shit out . I don't appricate getting comments in dumbed down, butchured English. I speak and read proper English just fine. Save yourself the embarrasment of the ridicule and just type your comments or emails to me right.

        Hello Dustin.... My name is Dark Magician.... I'm a moderator for Chat Ave.... I Mod the General Chat room, and I can tell you that in that room there is a semblance of sanity.... The other Moderators for that room as well as my self do not tolerate racism, stalking, flooding or predators.... As a matter of fact, we reported a predator just yesterday to the proper authorities.... I just wanted to let you know that we the Moderators of General Chat do run a clean room.... Thanks for your time  - Dark Magician    That was the reply I got from one of the ChatAve Mods because of my rant about ChatAvenue.  This reply makes sense. This person tell's me that the General Chat moderators do their jobs and that sounds good but I see no such progress in control in the other rooms. Such a fact can be seen in the screen shot below.    This was from Teen Chat. I had to sit in there no less than two minutes or so before this started.       "I just wanted to let you know that we the Moderators of General Chat do run a clean room.... Thanks for your time"    The point here is that I've noticed that the General Chat does appear to be quite a bit better and the moderator there does appear to be doing their job, if it really needs to be done. The place seems to be under conrol and somewhat sane but it's still not something I'd really plan to frequent.    The moderators in the other rooms however, don't seem to be doing that much at all. So, I've changed my mind about this ranting somewhat. Now I've decided that it seems the Teen/Adult Chatrooms are the whorehouses, not the whole site.   And as for the other comments so far, thanks.    My favorite quotes to comments from this so far...    "Being a whore is "in" right now. - Anomynous"  "I can tell you that in that room there is a semblance of sanity.... - Dark Magician"    Now, I think I need some new material instead of ranting about chatrooms forever.

       Foolish Canadians eh? Just take a look at who's running your country, and then tell me who's foolish. I'm sick of your shit, I have no reason to return to this waste of Blogger's space and bandwidth. Just keep bitching about every damn thing, Dustin, just see how many friends you get, besides the zero you already have.    Whatever, I'm outta here.    ~Will        I didn't vote for Bush. Hell, I can't even vote. It's not even my fault he's president. Ok, the title was a little off, but whatever. I have friends. Hey, I don't think this blog is a waste of space or bandwidth, there is worse out there than me. And you made a comment in the wrong thing. Are you that stupid?

      What is wrong with you two? I should have sworn that you wanted me to leave you alone. I thought this worked both ways. That if I left you alone, you should do the same and not bother me.     If only you knew that no one gives a shit. Shut the fuck up and delete your shitty blog immediately. :)  ~Tubba (Kelvin)   Ha! I laugh at that. Like you little turd of a page on GeoShitties is any better. I noticed you deleted my link but that doesn't really concern me because you don't get enough hits to really matter anyway. And, no. The blog is staying where it is. If I was to take my blog down because of its "shitty content", then you and Will should do the same to your GeoShitties sites.     You should delete your blog, forever. Nobody likes it and it's shitty.  ~SSJ3Quina (William)   Look, William. Just because you and Kelvin have something against me now doesn't mean you need to fill my blog with suguesstions on how I should delete it, format my computer, etc. I don't care what you think and I will not do what you say. Your website is even worse. No real content and half of it is shit. Didn't you know the suguesstions box is for commenting on the  article  and not for bashing me and telling me to take my blog off the Internet.  Will, Kelvin, do yourselves a favour and leave me the fuck alone already. I've left you alone by request, you should do the same for me.  Now get lost and don't come back.

      As of this writing, I've had my own connection to the internet for around a year and a half.   One change I made to my internet browsing is when I finally dumped Internet Explorer and moved to Mozilla Firefox.   Now, even though IE is up to v6 and the latest version of Firefox is v0.9.1 , I must agree that, even though Firefox is still in beta, its a far better browser in my opinion. I've used it since v0.8 and I think it's an excellent alternative to Internet Explorer.   A few reasons being?  Well, for one, I find it to be a lot more secure that IE will ever be, especially when paired with a  decent firewall. One thing that Firefox does not include that IE does is a little thing called ActiveX. What it basically is is something that can add/change stuff on your computer with or without your consent. Since this can be and has been proven to be a security hole, Firefox does not include it.   Secondly, you can add extentions. Basically, you can make it the way you want it. You don't need  to download a bunch of unneeded features. If you need them, all you need to do is find the appropriate extention. If there isn't the extention you need, you can go to the  urlLink MozillaZine Forum   (Sometimes down due to overload)  and make a request and, if the request is reasonable, a extention might be made or it might end up just being integrated into the browser.   It can also be themed. There are plenty of themes for Firefox and some are pretty visually pleasing. They can also be configured so you can have what buttons you want up the main taskbar instead of like in IE where the buttons are pratically stuck in place and can't be rearranged or switched around.   Also, Firefox has a thing called Tabbed Browsing. What tabbed browsing is basically, you can have tabs in the browser and you can click them to go to the pages you have open. But the magic of it is that Firefox normally has only have one button on the taskbar taking up space but you can have mulitiple tabs open in the browser at once. Great, eh? Firefox also has a built-in pop-up blocker that works pretty well and the nice thing is is that it doesn't take a external toolbar to work, like the Google Toolbar in IE. The pop-up blocker is built in.   Firefox also supports newer standards than IE, namely, ones laid out by the  urlLink W3C  . It supports standards that M$ apparenly doesn't care to add support for in IE. Sometimes you may come across a page that says they only support IE but the problem is not with Firefox, usually, but with the fact that the webmaster has made it so it only works right in IE. Sometimes menus don't work or other things. But really, its the webmasters fault for not making his sites code work in other browsers besides IE, like it should. When you run across a problem like this, you can download an extention called IE View and what that does is add a option on right click to view the page in IE if you ever have to.   Basically, the problem with IE is that it has security holes up the ass, does not support all web standards, its too easily exploited, its so far integrated into the OS that M$ says, if you remove it, its gonna pratically ruin your OS and so on.   Firefox does support more webstandards, it is not as easily exploited, it is not integrated into the OS like IE, and it can be themed and extended.   Also, Firefox is open source which means, like if a bug is found, you can report it and they will get around to fixing it and actually release a newer version within a couple of months with most of the bugs that were reported fixed. Does M$ do that with IE, at least withing a decent timeframe? Not from what I've seen.   Sadly, some things just require IE still like Windows Update. That is one of the few times I actually have to use IE but most of the time I can just use Firefox.   Have I not convinced you?  urlLink Give this article a read then.   If you feel convinced,  urlLink give Firefox a shot .   For some, Firefox v0.9 hasn't been the best fit. In that case,  urlLink the slightly older v0.8 seems to work better for some.   I hope you are convinced like I am. Overall, I feel Firefox is a superior browser to IE by far.

         I recently paid a visit to the hell I abandoned long ago,  urlLink ChatAvenue  , to see if it had improved. Obviously, not one of the idiots there even bothered to read  urlLink this . Let's take a look at what that page says.   1) Age Requirements - Users should be over the age of 13. Minors should be accompanied by a parent or guardian.  2) Be careful - people online may not be who they say they are no matter how convincing they may sound.  3) Do NOT give out any personal information (i.e where you live, your school, telephone number etc) - you may end up being contacted by people you don't want.  4) Never arrange to meet someone offline unless you are sure who they are; go accompanied (if you are under 18 by your parent or carer); and meet in a public place.   Oh, look. Its the Chat Safety rules. Guess nobody did read this because  no one seems to be following it at all  . Is it that hard to get a brain in your head and just follow the rules? Looking at this certain place, I'd say thats a no.  Now, what does #2, #3 and #4 of the Chat Safty rules say?. I'm sure these chatters didn't read that because these people seem to hand out their personal information to almost anyone that wants it, some of them arrange to meet someone offline with people that they have known for less than a few hours and they are too easily decived by the person they are talking to. This has got to stop.   This place, and most other chat-rooms for that matter, haven't made change for the better. Not at all. It's was hell when I left it and its still hell now.  Turns out the same tried and true teen chat-room standard still applies for this particular place. It isn't a normal chat-room, its pratically an on-line whorehouse. You can't have a casual conversation like you would expect from a normal chat-room there.   When you are there, it seems you are expected to, a) Go out and sell your body like a whore and try to get any guy that will buy into the fact that you're the horny girl you whore yourself out to be and that the guy you picked up will most likely get off to the both of you making up a "cyber sex" scene. Or you could, b) Be a pimp and pick up a girl who's under the impression your dick is twice the size that is really is like the sick pervert you are. I bet you at least half these "teenage guys" there are really just middle-aged pervs trying to pick up a 18 or under girl. That's just gross and wrong. Ugh. Just, ugh...   These kind of people sicken me. They take their personalities, well-being and throw it all in the trash. They have almost no decency at all. These are the type of people who don't deserve to be on the Internet. To top it off, they do other stupid things like trying to arrange to call and meet people they have known for less than a day and they type like morons. Hell, I bet even a monkey could get out a typed sentence more proper and legible than these morons could even dream of typing. I'm not totally serious with that statement, but go into this place for a few minutes, if you can bear it, and you'll get the gist of what I mean.  In fact, one time, when I was still going to this hell they call a chatroom, I got a few messages from people that made no damn sense oncesoever. I actually had to request that they'd repeat it in proper English. Some stugguled at it, some didn't do it at all and others just couldn't do it at period because they are illiterate morons.   Some may whine  "but dustin, ur a teenager 2 lol!!!11!" .  Well, yes that is true, but at least I'm not a whore on the Internet who speaks gibberish.  I'm glad people like this don't know how to use IRC. And if they do, at least they aren't populous by the room full, well from what I've seen.   I'm also glad some forms of authority are starting to crack down on these people. This shit needs to stop.

      Its been too damn hot lately....    Yesterday it almost touched 100 fahrenheit (~37 celcius) . I will say that is about the hottest I've seen it in Seattle in years. With the typical weather we get, usually either mild, overcaset and raining, I'm just not used to it getting this damn hot. Somebody told me its around 80f (~26c) almost all year round in southren California and that I should stop complaining.    Wait, lets stop and think for a second. I don't live in Southren California. I live in cold, dreary Washington. I'm not used to roasting 365 days a year, like it seems Californians do. So really, I think I do have room to bitch when weather this hot comes around here once in a few years and I'm not used to it. Unlike a lot of people in California, I really don't have a tolerance to a lot of damn heat all day. I'm most used to 60-70f (15-21c) tempartures. I can stand stuff up to 80f (26c) without much complaint, but any hotter and thats where I'm not used to and its when I start to bitch.     Weather websites say it's only 74 (23c) out today, so thats a lot more tolerable.  I should really stop bitching about the weather and just deal with it. It will probaly be gone and relaced with the mild weather we usually get in a week anyway, so I should enjoy it while it's here.

        I've been blocked for some of the dumbest reasons I've heard of.       Today, I got blocked twice... by the same person      1) Because one custom emoticon I made on MSN didn't have the transparency just right, when I said it did. The person I was talking to got mad and asked me to fix it. When I though it was fixed and had a transparent background, I posted it again and it turns out, it didn't work. He all starts insulting me and saying I dont know how to use Paint (I didn't really use Paint for this job) and he goes off and blocks me. I'm sorry, but I'm no perfectionist and if you want one, I'm not it. Go look elsewhere.       2) By the same person as before. The person came back and said that they would unblock me, just as long as I helped them find a ROM for a SNES game. I told him I really didn't want to do it because of the legality of it, because those sites can put a lot of crap onto your computer and also because I didn't feel like making my computer a guinea pig to aid in his searches so he blocked me again.    3) Same person, once again. I've been labeled a redneck because I'm a tad slow to respond because I'm preoccupied doing  a few other things while chatting. Is there some law somewhere that says I cannot multitask? Sure, ok, I may be a tad slow to respond when I'm doing a few things at once but I get sidetracked sometimes, it happens. But, I'm a redneck? Wait, lets evaulate here. I'm not a redneck. Why?          I do not live in the South.     My house is not on wheels.          I do not live off food stamps and/or welfare.     My cousin is not my wife.         I've graduated from the 5th grade.         Simply put, I'm not a redneck.   (I know that was mostly based off streotype, but its just a joke. Dont be so serious about it).        Whatever though, isn't my problem. If he wants those things so badly, he can take the risk of seaching for them by himself.     But really. Those are the dumbest reasons I've seen to block somebody in quite a while. I feel I did the right thing though. I'm not going to break the law and crud up my comptuer in the process so he could have his little game. Uh huh, I don't work that way.

      My ISP, NetZero, seems to be whoreing their service in any form that they can.     So far, I've have/had to see their ads on/in        - Television.         - When I dial-up.         - Thru Email     - When I go to their site to bitch to tech support        I'm getting sick of seeing all their advertisemtents. Now, I know, with the way most busissness that service the public are, that getting the word out about it can help buisness. But its getting anoyying seeing them whoreing their service out in any form that they can is getting on my nerves a bit. I do have a few things to bitch about the ways they advertise     TV Commericals: These are annoying. They show commerials where they go from city to city and show gullible idiots about their high-speed service, that even though its fast, the downloads are still at dial-up speeds. Great idea, not. Then they got those "Canadate" ones where they say switching to their service will save them money. Yea, it may save you money, but the saved money will mostly be lost buying asprin and liquior after getting so many headaches from the crappy service and from getting pissed at tech support.     During Dial-Up: This one gets me too. I pay for their service, yet I still have to see advertisements when I dial-up to the internet. That would be something to do to a free user, since they are not paying, but to do that to a paying customer doesn't make much sense.     Thru Email: They like to send me advertisements for stuff from them thru email. Their policy says something about that they will not send me third-party junk mail, but I guess they then think it's just fine for them to send junk to their customers. Thankfully, I'm training my mail-client to just send this stuff straight to Junk, and it did just that last time, so it seems that the filter is learning. I don't need this crap.    When I go to Tech Support. They also have ads on their page. There's nothing I can do about it though, even though I have an ad blocker. Their little laws they have laid down state that I cannot use anything to either alter or prevent ads from being displayed. Heh, I wonder what they would do if I did that. Oh, boo hoo, I did something so I didn't have to see your stupid ad's. What are you going to do about it?    This is just getting sickening. It just seems that they are just whoreing it out every way they can and I'm getting pissed because of it.

      I went out and bought me a 54x32x54 CD-RW drive, which cost $39.99. The  price wasn't too bad. I put it in the computer, hooked everything up  and whatnot, started Windows, burned a CD and proceeded to check to see  if the files were on the disc and the bitch that is Windows Explorer  had to crash 6+ times like it was Windows ME under the hood, which it  isn't. Godammit. Then I was finally able to get Explorer to work and  there was nothing on it.    Godammit, Microsoft and your shitty products.    The only thing by MS I use on a regular basis is Windows XP. I try to  use alternatives, if possible, to their other pre-packaged crap.    While were on the subjusct, I feel like putting up the technical  specifications of the computer I have built up so far from scratch.    Processor: AMD Duron 1.8 GHz Mainboard: Abit VA-10 (Micro-ATX)  RAM: 256 MB. PC-2100 DDR HDD: 40 GB. ATA/100 Western Digital  Video: GeForceFX 5200 - 128 MB. RAM  Optical: 54x write 32x rewrite 54x read CD-RW OS: Windows XP Home Ed. SP1   Sure, it isn't the fastest thing on the planet but it works fine for me and it's a lot better than my old machine.

      I've been bashing horny, sex-crazed chatters for a while now but I wanted to show how easily I have been able to fool them.   Now,  I'm not weird or anything , I just did this to see how easily I could fool them and because I was a bit bored. I've been able to fool  a good handful of them . I could probaly get a little job with authorities that crack down on online predators or something like that because, from what these screenshots show, I've been able to fool people into thinking I'm someone I'm not rathter easily.   urlLink  C/A  has been about the only place where I pulled this. Most other places, I'm just myself, not trying to be someone else. Oh yea, on with the screenshots.      This guy thought I was a whore and apparently fell for it until I reveled who I was and told him that I hoped he learned a lesson because I said "Not everybody is the person they whore themselves out to be" and I think I speak the truth with that.        She said she was a lesbian and I was trying to act like one also. If you didn't notice, the reason I turned down the virtual blowjob was because she said that she was a guy too. I thought she was lying but played along anyway and acted like she was a guy and just slowly backed away from the scene.       Here is another lesbian. I tried to act like a lesbian also.      Now, I know this is kinda weird, but I got somebody to admit to liking anus licking.     Yea. I've fooled more than that but those were some of the memorable ones. I just got bored and thats why I did that. It appears I was able to pull it off. I don't know why I brought this up. Something to put into the blog I guess..

      I'm starting to think that I no longer wish to be a customer to this company anymore.   I only pay $9.95/month for it but it has problems like constant disconnections at times, auto disconnections after 4 hours and it pratically can't upload anything worth shit. It seems to struggle with anything past 10KB.  The current version doesn't work right on my laptop. When I requested an older version, they kept on cramming the new one down my throat telling me how good it is with its floating toolbars and all that other shit I never use. Newsflash, dumb fuck, I just use it for what it is, a cheap Internet connection, not for all that cruddy bloat. The only time I use their stupid toobar is to click Disconnect.. They completely ignore any customer input and keep on pushing what they think works even after I already tried it many times with no sucuess . Fuckin bastards.  I'd switch ISP's but anybody else at the same price probaly isn't any better. It's the best I can get for now. I'm glad I don't have to pay them more than $10 a month, they don't deserve anymore than that

      Because I think politics are frauds....  Like the Govenor of Washington, Gary Locke. Before he got in, he was promising tax cuts right and left and when he got in, what was the first thing he tried to do? Raise taxes. When Gary didn't get his way, he threw a tantrum of sorts, he threatned to stop freeway repairs and a few other things. And lets not forget Bush. I think he cheated his way in. These elections are not fair. Thats why I say the votes don't count. They dont get the votes they want, they just fuck things up and hope it leans in their favour.   Really, I just think they are just in it for the money, if that wasn't obvious enough. Why do you think Gary wanted higher taxes? I think it was so he could pocket the extra money for himself. Really, I think they are lining their pockets with gold at our expense.  That is one reason I will not discuss politics. I think they are a bunch of lying, cheating frauds and I refuse to talk about them. I'm too lazy to come up with more reasons now, bother me about it later.

      When I see these commercials on TV where its like  "Got bad credit? Need help?" , it just makes me think of how stupid these people were to get that fucked. Then it shows all these ugly people going on and on about how bad their credit is/was and how they got help.  Its just sickening. These people are irresponsible enough to get themselves in too deep then they expect  somebody else  to get them out, yet they are too oblivious to look back and just see why they got so fucked? Perhaps it was the  mulitiple credit cards  charged to the moon, the undenying desire to have many expensive material poseesions or perhaps the idiocracy to not manage and save their money and rather spend everything on a credit card?  Really, then that bitch and her husband come on and they are like "We had a so many creditors calling our house that we were afraid to answer the phone anymore". Guess what bitch? You know why they are calling your house? Because you borrowed from then and now you owe them back, yet you haven't paid them back. Thats why they are calling you.  If you were more responsible in managing your money like you should, paid them back and didn't signup for every credit card you got in the mail and then charging it to high heaven, then you probaly wouldn't have to be bailed out or having creditors ring your phone off the hook.  Really. And then they bitch about having to file for bankruptucy over and over. I should have sworn I heard one person said they filed for bankruptucy like 15+ times. How dense are people? I'd think most people would learn after having to file for bankrupcy that they need to improve how they handle their money and stop sending their credit to hell, but  obviously not.   These people are just stupid. Most of them were dumb enough to fuck up and get themselves the way they are. These people don't deserve help. They got themselves in that hole, they can get themselves out. Now that I think about this, it reminds me of that one bitch,  Karyn ,  urlLink who started that website  that expected somebody else to help her out even though she was the one who fucked up.  One thing I want to point out is that the people with bad credit I'm targeting is the careless, irresponsible spenders, like Karyn for example. She was careless, spent a lot of money and expected somebody just to give her the easy way out. A person like her doens't deserve help because she was just carelessly charging her credit cards up the wall. Yea, she may try to cram that "I'm a shopaholic" crap down my throat, but its offical. She's a irresponsible bitch when it comes to credit managment.  Now, on the other hand, if somebody cant afford something importnant that 's expensive, like collage or for some other important reason, then they are better in my eyes because they didn't get themselves in a pit of debt through careless spending and they say they will use the money for a good cause, then I think they are more deserving of being able to borrow money and get help because of their bad credit. Some have bad credit for good reasons and I think they deserve help. The ones who got bad credit through careless spending, I think, do not deserve finacial help.  People who are careless spenders and have bad credit need to be beaten.   (I'm just joking about the beating but really)

      This is starting to get on my nerves...   I got over 7 disconnections in less than two hours. That usually doens't happen. Now, I only pay $10 a month but that still is no way to provide service to a paying customer. I can understand that perhaps the server was having a bad day or the line quailty was too poor to maintain a decent connection, but still. Really, this along with all the other problems I have with this service it makes me think that $10 a month is all I should spend on them and not a dime more. For the trouble, it isn't worth any more than that. I hope the service quaily improves in the future or I'm going to move to another ISP.   Godammit.

      ..... But that does not automatically make them good again.  The kind of persons I'm referring to is those child molesting priests/reverends/rabbis/saints/whatever. It seems every once in a while, I hear yet another one of these sick fucks have yet again molested somebody, yet they can go straight to a high church offical afterwards and get forgiven for what they have done, even after they have been proven guilty for what they have done. That is just really sick and that is just wrong. They shouldn't be forgiven at all, they do not deserve forgiveness. And yet, they tell me that  I'm  going to burn in Hell. If there is anybody that is going to be burning in Hell, it should be these sick bastards. They should be thrown in prison for their crime and for the rest of their lives days let Bubba have their ass so they can experience what they have done to their victims.   Like I've said in the past, I'm an Athiest and I really find no problem with other people pursuing the faith they have chosen to pratice, but these people just give the religions a bad image. I think these people may be one of the reasons I've chosen to be an Athiest.   This is just sick. I think I'm done with this topic now.

      Really, I am. After getting treated like a computer-illeterate moron and getting shitty help on many occasions, I've just gotten sick of technical support.   Let's observe one call for help that did not happen too long ago. I told them (my ISP) that I wanted to be able to run their dial-up software off of a Limited Account in XP. I told them I did not feel like resorting to making it an Admin Account becuase I did not want to grant the other person all those privilages. Last thing I need is a hijacked account.   Lets see my message to them....   I use Windows XP Home Ed. SP1 and when I try to connect to NetZero under a Limited Account, it appears to connect and then it hangs up and says "The system detected a problem in saving user prefrences" and it asks me to call a number. I really don't feel like calling since this only happens when I run NZ under a Limited Account on XP. When I run NZ under the Computer Admin. account, it runs just fine, but will not work at all under Limited. A few other people who use this computer would like to use the Internet too but I really do not want to give them Administrator rights, for the obvious reasons of what can be done with what comes with it. Is there a way to configure either settings in Windows or NZ so I can make this run under a Limited account? By the way, the access number or the firewall do not seem to affect this problem.   After waiting a while, I got this reply from them...   Dear Dustin,  Thank you for contacting NetZero Help Center.  To resolve your problem please follow the steps given below.    (The instructions on how to switch the account type in XP were here. I took out since they were a waste of space - Dustin)   I hope this addresses your concern. Should you require any further assistance please do write back.   Thanks for using NetZero!   Wow! I pay you $10 a month, you give me shitty service and you're thanking me?. Sure, your welcome, whatever. Keep the change, asshole. I know that since I only pay $10 a month for Internet that I don't have that much room to bitch but at least I'm paying for my Internet, though it isn't much, so I can bitch if I want.  I find the way they run their support rather un-professional of them. First of all, they treat me like an idiot and tell me how to do something I already know how to do and on top of that, it was the thing I told them I did not want to resort to.    A few other people who use this computer would like to use the Internet too but I really do not want to give them Administrator rights, for the obvious reasons of what can be done with what comes with it. Is there a way to configure either settings in Windows or NZ so I can make this run under a Limited account?    I don't know if I made my request apparent enough. Obviosuly, I guess I didn't because it seems the support person either just ignored this part or is dense, perhaps both, because, I think I made it noticable enough for most people to take a hint that I didn't want to do make the account have Admin privilages to work but they gave me the wrong help anyway.   Did I mention the disconnections? I know it's dial up and it happens but the disconnections can be a real pain in the ass, like when I'm right in the middle of trying to download something. Yea, I'm trying to browse the Internet and all the sudden Firefox starts spitting back timeout errors and everything and then "click". All this box pops up and says "Your session is now ending" and another one pops up with that annoying noise and says "Your connection was lost for unknown reasons. NetZero will now restart". Great excuse asshole, nothing. You waste my time and cut back my productivity with a disconnection and you have no reason behind it. Screw you.   It's just getting sickening. I ask for help from them and either its help for the computer-illeterate, asking to check for things that were set right ages ago, completely irrevent, or something I didn't request, like this.   I'm rather unsastified with the help I get from not just this technical support, but most other tech support too.   They eventually got it right but it'd be nice if they would just get it on the first try, not like the second or third. I'm not expecting complete excellence but they could do better than they are doing. At least I haven't had to deal with live telephone support. Half the people they got working for them I have to decipher their strong accent to understand them struggle at English.

      In the past, I've gotten harsh remarks told to me that I was going to Hell and quite a few other remarks just because I'm an Atheist. In fact, one time, this one girl asked me what me relgion was and I told her I was an Athiest. This was quickly followed by her with "You're going to Hell!"   Excuse me? Last time I checked, Ms. Bitch,  I had the freedom of religion which means I can choose if I want to pratice a religion or not!  It seems I have to keep my beliefs secretive because of the harsh remarks I may get from some. I don't like having to do that, I thought this was a free country. I feel that I don't have certain freedoms that I am entitled to as an American citizen when I'm around these religious bigots.   I'm curious, How does Ms. Bitch even know Hell exists anyway? Was she so bad that she died and went there and then was reincarnated or some bullshit like that? Somebody shouldn't be telling me where they think I'm gonna go when I die if they have no proof themselves that the place actually exists...  And also, they shouldn't be telling me I'm going to go to Hell, period. Just because I'm exercising my rights as an American citizen and choosing to be an Atheist shouldn't mean some religious bigot with their head up their ass should be treating me like I'm moral-less scum. I'm pretty sure I have plenty of morals and I personally think I'm a good person, I'm sure others who know me think the same, but bigots usually think otherwise.  Now, I'm not trying to say religion is wrong or the every one that practices it is wrong, but it's the religious bigots that get to me. Just as long as they just keep their beliefs and remarks to themselves, that's fine with me.     I think it's just wrong, however, to be walking around giving harsh remarks and scorn to people that don't practice the same faith or trying to force your beliefs onto them when the person has already decided the faith they are going to practice.    Religious bigots should just shut up and leave me be. I'm not bothering them so they should do the same for me and leave me alone about my choice to be Athiest.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Usually, I don't have to make notice of this but, but since a topic like this could sprawl into a ugly flame war....  Just so you know about it...  When I recieve any fanmail, hatemail, comments, etc, I will use it the way I see fit, within my boundaries I'm allowed. When you send me it, the email/comment/etc, becomes my posessesion. I have total control of whatever I do with your email/comment/etc.  I have my constitutional rights and I'm exercising them.

      As the school year came and went by, I had to deal with the teachers I was placed with, I came to the realization that some people are just not fit for the job. Looking upon my report card, I remember my time with these teachers vividly.   Lets do an analysis here....  Algebra - Oh how I loathe Algebra so. I've had the class the past two years, with three different teachers, at two different times of the day (1 1st period, 2 6th period.) and, even after all those teachers and two years time, I still don't know Algebra. Label me an idiot, you may, but it just doesn't work out right in my head. And the sad thing is when I went to go get help, the time it was offered was too inconvenient for me or the teacher would brush me off by trying to fill my head with inspirational bullshit and telling me I know how to do it. Hello? Are you dense? I just told you  I don't understand the work, goddamnit.  . Forget Algebra. If I get put in that class again, I'm going to talk to my counsellors and get out of it, because I can make better use of one hour at school than in an Algebra class. I do not mean skipping the class, I just want to do something else besides it. Of course, some of these counsellors are as bad as the teachers and they probaly will do nothing about it and make me go though it, once again.   Science - Science wasn't that great either. It was a Biology class in a class, not a lab setting. All we did was either watch long, old movies about animals or we were doing bookwook in shitty, busted up books. After setting out the worksheets for the work or whatever the teacher had planned, he procceed to stop doing his job and eat a ham sandwitch. Sometimes, the class was lucky enough to side-track him for the whole period in some off-topic discussion, but that was a rare event. It'd be nice if teachers could do their jobs right  Health - Basically, I learned nothing new here and it was a waste of time. I should have sworn I just saw and heard everything I already learned in Health back in 8th grade, but that didn't matter to my teacher. Some will tell me "Well you already know how to do the work, so just do it". Shut up. If I already know how to do something and I'm in a place like a school, I should be moving on to another class and learn something new, not get put in a class where the cirriculum consists of things I already know. Really, stop wasing my time and put me somewhere where I can be more productive. Leave the idiots who didn't get it years ago in there and just let me go learn something else.  Language Arts - Oh, wasn't that fun? I was never able to really work right in here. I had a feeling the teacher had some vendetta aginst me or something. In fact, towards the end of the school year, the teacher got sick of my low productivity and told me I was no longer welcome. That really isn't a good reason to give up on a student. I should have gotten help but none was really provided. When I wasn't doing my work, I was just sitting doing something quietly, not being a rowdy asshole like some people can be when they have nothing to do. But, whatever. I just went somewhere else. I really didn't feel like being in there anyway.   Those are the classes that I wasn't very happy with.   As for the classes I did good in and I was happy with..  I was doing just fine in my Cultural Geography class I had. Got a 45/50 on my paper on New Zealand I did and I was able to be really productive in that class. The teacher I had was a excellent example of how more teachers should be.   Personally, I think I can be a great productive student if I get a decent teacher who cares that I'm actually learning something from them over just getting their job done halfassed so they can get their paycheck. A teacher like that is one I can respect, but there few and far inbetween. I have been accused of not doing the work and that is true but if the teacher is not willing to hold up his end of the deal, then why should I even bother?   In closeing, I got through the year and will probaly have to do summer school but I'm just not too happy with how the system works and if it ever improves, I'll probaly be out of school by then.

      This evening when I went out for dinner to Applebee's. I was the lucky person to get seated next to the most rowdy people in the restaraunt.   The food I ordered for my dinner was quite good and the service was great but I really didn't appricate at all having to sit next to these people. For being adults, from what I seen, they appeared to be rather immature. One of them was really loud, making a bunch of noise, cursing out loud and a doing a bunch of other rowdy things, in a public restaraunt. And then after a while, his damn pants fell to his ankles and there was two kids just a table up and over. I'm sure the parents of those kids don't really like those kind of people around their kids at all and I'm positive almost no one in that restraunt really wants to see that guy in his boxers.   Also, as I was just sitting there and eating my dinner, I overheard the people starting to say I looked like Harry Potter. I swear, just because I wear glasses and have short, black hair doesn't automatically make me loook like Harry Potter so they can just shut it now while they are still ahead. I don't know about you but I really don't like people I do not even know talking about whatever they think of me, at all. Period. One of them also had a cell-phone with one of those godammeed high-pitched ringer on it and it went off like two, maybe even three times. Goddamn, shut that fucker off already.   When they were about ready to go, they wanted their women to pick up the tab and then the one guy tried to ask the waiter for more ribs because he got all-you-can eat. But the waiter was sharp enough to catch on to this and denyed his request since he knew what he was about to do. I guess he didn't know that's alll you can eat  here  , not all you can eat at your house later. I'm suprised management did not throw these people out of the restaraunt. The women they were with were acting decent from what I've seen and probaly embarassed to be around such idiots. But the guys, they were just one of the most indecent demonstations of how to act in a restraunt I've seen.   These people had almost no class at all. Now, I'm not expecting the best but really, when you are in a public place, you should just get your act together and act properly. What they were doing was not what I call proper. I just tried my best to ignore them. I didn't want to start anything. I just ate my dinner and got out of there. I hope the next time I plan to dine out for dinner that I don' t end up getting put next to people like this again.

      A while back, somebody told me that Francis Scott Key, the man who made the American National Anthem, was Canadian. I really didn't look into it at the time but I really didn't agree with what they said either.  Today, I looked into it and made a discovery. Francis S. Key was born in 1780 and died in 1843 ( urlLink Source ). I then looked up on Wikipedia for when Canada was founded. I learned that Canada was formed in 1867 ( urlLink Source ). Now, tell me this. How the hell could Francis S. Key been Canadian if Canada was formed 24 years after his death? I can't really understand how somebody could be from a country that didn't even exist when they were alive.  Just something I looked into to see if they were right.  I don't have anything aginst most Canadians, I was just reasearching to see if I could disprove their statement.

      I noticed Microsoft finally got around to releasing SP2. I went to check what the buzz was about.  Lets see whats included in the package  - Popup Blocker for IE - IE Download Monitor - IE Info Bar - IE Add-On Manager - OE Privacy Updates - Attachment Manager  The list goes on for a few more pages. Looks like mostly useless crap for the size of the service pack. Personally, I don't think it's worth it when you compare how big the pack is to what you get with it. It appears to me that most of it can be replaced by superior, third-party apps.  SP2, last I checked was over 200MB. I know personally that you could get just as much fuctionailty, if not more, from third-party programs in a much smaller total download overall rather than keep on using, patching and updating crappy MS stuff. I asked somebody that could actually download it in less than a week. I was told it really wasn't worth it, so I probaly won't do it. You won't catch me downloading this crap anytime soon.  It's getting annoying being pressured to download these gigantic service packs to keep Windows in check then getting blamed by MS Support when Windows goes haywire from some expolit that was patched in the pack and they tell you to download it. Pfft, I'm not made of money. I'd probaly do it if the damn thing wasn't so fucking gigantic and didn't come cram-packed with shit I can just replace with better stuff. I'll I have is dial-up and thats the best I can do for now. Those crapacks can wait . Why can't they get it straight? It seems Billy lets things get way out of hand first and then after a few months, he finally summons his programmers to patch the exploit. Then everyone in a while, he'll take time out of his busy schedule to get his programmers to make these service packs chock full of useless crap with tons more patches for his buggy, exploitable creations. Once people get around to downloading SP2, hackers will just find more ways to expoit Windows and all the other things in Windows. I'm sure of it. Windows is basically a hackers wet dream, it seems.   Bill Gates is just an evil bitch. Probaly the mortal form of Satan.

      (Click title to see what I'm talking about)  Anymore useless comments that I see that do not have to do with the said article will be deleted on site. Currently, its a problem with some Canadians who used to be my friends, but now they are far from friends. They made a few spam comments, which spurred an email to both of them.    Just cut it out. This is just childish. I know you two hate me, no need to remind me once a week or more. I know you hate me and my site, but just keep it to yourselves and leave me alone already, really.  urlLink

      I'm trying to sequence a MIDI for a video game, and it is hard. I'm a member at the forum on  urlLink this  website. They have MIDI's for many games across many platforms. I'm trying to do one that hasn't been sequenced to death already, like FF, Zelda and Mario. There's too many finished ones to really warrent trying out that. It seems for each song, there 1 original and 5+ remixes, whichare sequenced to death. Somebody I know showed me a few that shouldn't be too hard to do. Easy for him to say, heh. I'll see what I can do though. I want to try this, I'm just struggling to pull it off. Hats off to the people that are good at this and make quailty MIDI's. I know now it isn't as easy as it looks.

      I use Windows. Sure, I could use Linux, but nothing I have runs on it. I could use Mac, if they wern't so damn expensive! Even though Windows is Bill's torture device, I don't use half the crap that he likes to package with Windows.  Here are some alternatives I reccomend.   Web Browsing   Instead of using Internet Explorer, use Firefox (Just Google it, Blogger is screwing up my links). Some think the low version number is a turn off, in compairison to v6 that IE is up to and v7.x that Opera is at, but I still think Firefox is the best thing to use to browse the web. I don't know if it was obvious enough from earlier posts, but I'm a proud Firefox user. I have an article,  urlLink here  , which I think sums up quite a few reasons why you should say bye-bye to IE. There are other people that say the same. Firefox 1.0 is coming sometime in near September. I'm sure Firefox users are really anticipating this one, its supposed to be good. There are other browsers out there, like Opera. I find Opera to be a bit too clunky and bloated for my tastes.   E-Mail/Newsgroups.   I used to use Outlook/Outlook Express, I then tried out Mozilla's email and newsgroup client (  Just Google it, Blogger screwed up this link too) and I must say, I'm quite impressed. For what it's job is, it does it quite well. Sure, like Firefox, it's version number is still pre-1.0, but it still is a decent, secure and stable email client.   Media   Instead of Windows Media Player, I use WinAmp   .Were you expecting another Mozilla product? I don't think Mozilla is in the media player development department. There are quite a few things I like a lot more about WinAmp over WMP. For one, its a lot easier, for me at least, to manage playlists and all my media related things. It also doesn't look that bad and, just as long as your computer isnt' terribly old, it runs quite well. Sure, there are other media players out there, but I like WinAmp, and I think it isn't half bad.   Picture Viewing   Instead of whatever is used for default photo viewing in Windows (I think it's IE in 9x and XP has its own thing), I use  urlLink IrfanView  . It's great if you just need to view a file, or perhaps save it in a diffrent format. When you use the downloaded program and the added attachement, you can view a TON of formats with it, like....  In the Help file under "Supported File Formats", it lists  AIF¹, ANI, AU¹, AVI, B3D, BMP, CAM, CLP, CPT, CRW, CUR, DAT¹, DCM/ACR, DCX, DDS, DIB, DJVU, DLL/EXE, DXF, ECW, EMF, EPS, FLI/FLC², FPX, FSH, G3, GIF, ICL, ICO, IFF/LBM, IMG, JP2, JPG/JPEG, JPM, KDC, LDF, LWF, Mac PICT², MED, MID, MNG/JNG, MOV¹², MP3, MPG/MPEG¹, MrSID, NLM/NOL/NGG/NSL/OTB/GSM, OGG, PBM, PCX, PGM, PhotoCD, PNG, PPM, PSD, PSP, QTIF², RAS/SUN, RealAudio, RAW, RLE, RMI, SFF, SFW, SGI/RGB, MrSID, SWF, SND¹, TGA, TIFF/TIF, TTF, TXT, WAD, WAV, WBMP, WMF, WMA, WMV, XBM, XPM, (NEF, ORF, RAF, MRW, DCR).  Thats quite a bit, there are even some in there I haven't heard of. Lets see MS try to pull that off.   [New]   Web Development   I have found a FrontPage Express alternative,  urlLink Nvu  . Ironically enough, its layout engine is Gecko, the same layout engine in the Mozilla Suite, Firefox and Thunderbird. It seems pretty nice. I don't really work on my GeoCities website much (Although I may start back on it), but this seems pretty nice alternative to FrontPage Express.  I feel these products are superior replacements to whatever Billy is bundling with Windows nowadays. I hope you try them out and see for yourself if you think they are good replacments for MS's products.  (Excuse my spelling errors, the spell checker that Blogger has in their composition thing isn't working right in Firefox)

       If you don't know who Mary K. Letourneau is, she is the bi-polar elementary school teacher who taught at a school in Burien, Washington that was said to have an affair with a student she seduced and, quote "raped". The court convicted her of such and threw her in a minimum-security correctional institution for 7-1/2 years. The guy has got her pregant twice. The court ruled that they are not to make contact with each other anymore, but I think they'll probaly be fuckin each other silly anyway once shes out. The guy is legal now, I think.  Getting a job is going to be fun for her because if you are convicted of such a crime in the State of Washington, you have to register as a sex offender for life, from what I read. Not that I really care that shes getting out, she's just kinda been on the news a lot in the past for what she has done. Now, I know what I've said isn't 100% accurate, but I'm trying. Anyone think that she really seduced and "raped" him? I don't really think so. I know he got her pregant but I believe it was consentual, not "rape". From what I know, they were both "lovers". Wait, I actually think they called it "consentual rape". That doesn't make much sense. How is it rape if its consentual?  They said she will be realeased sometime next week. Anybody outside of Washington ever hear of her? I know it was all over the news here when this became public but I don't know about many other places.
