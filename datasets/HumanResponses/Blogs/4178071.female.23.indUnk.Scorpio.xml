      Today has been a whirling blur.  It was the first day of school at the university that I work at, so students were in & out of my office all day, and I had to work furiously to make sure I had all loose ends tied up for the next week. Plus, emailing back and forth with the schools, trying to make a plan of where I need to go, how to get there.  (Though I have traveled a fair amount, it was usually with a group and someone else was the designated bus/train/plane schedule reader.  I was usually the picker outer of good places to eat and spotter of gelatto stands.)  But everyone at the schools have been just amazingly helpful; their emails are informal and warm, Edinburgh even more so than KCL.  I don't think schools in the US, or at least the ones I have had contact with, are that helfpful.  And I have several friends in the UK kind enough to agree to put me up.  One even called me after getting my email to make me promise to stay with his family at some point in my mini-trip.  That really made me feel great, assured me that I'm making the right choice....  I'm glad I have friends to wait for me (and vice versa) during my journey.  so there, HD Thoreau.

      After scouring the internet all day, I was finally able to find plane tickets to London for a few hundred dollars!  I about fell out of my seat when I saw the price.  Hopefully some friends will agree to put me up, so I'll be able to save money there, too.  So, in about 36 hours, I'll be on a plane to the UK... craziness.  I'm going to stay up tonight and email all the offices that I need to visit at Edinburgh and KCL.  All of this is happening so incredibly fast.  Am I crazy for doing this?

      Having a hard time making my decision, I called my mom tonight and discussed the possibility of her shelling out about.... $1500.... so I can go to the UK for a few days and check out both schools. That's a lot of money, isn't it? It's about 1/3 the cost of my car. But this is a huge decision! What if I make the wrong one?? What if I decide to go to London, but then can't crack it because I spend too many nights in pubs downing pints or sipping wine at the theatre, or something like that. It would be a disaster. So she's going to let me know tomorrow, and then I'd be on a flight sometime later this week. I HATE asking for money from my mom. But long story short, we had a deal that she would help pay for part of this. It wasn't completely altruistic on her part, we made a deal of sorts, but still, I appreciate it immensely.  In the meantime, I've been reading tonight, one of those books that I've never quite made it all the way through, but it still has a fair amount of exclamation points in the margins and indignant highlighting. Walden, by Henry David Thoreau. You probably know a few lines from it... in Dead Poets' Society, they quote: "I went to the woods because I desired to live deliberately... I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life..." and the damning reflection, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation." Last year, when my friend Betsy left to go to school at the Univ. of Edinburgh, I quoted Walden in her going-away card: "...be a Colombus to whole new continents and worlds within you, opening new channels, not of trade, but of thought. Every man is the lord of a realm beside which the earthly empire of the Czar is but a petty state..."  I love those lines, I claim them as my own, but there are others of Thoreau's to which I object, the chief being: "Above all, as I have implied, the man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another must wait til that other is ready, and it may be a long time before they get off." Perhaps, but I would rather view the Cliffs of Moor or the Sistine Chapel or a sunset on the Florida beach while holding someone's hand. The destination is not the goal. I would rather be an eternity in getting off (ahem - in the Thoreau sense) then be forever wandering alone. And I have not always felt that way. But somewhere during college, when I did spend quite a bit of time traveling, when I nearly froze at the Cliffs of Moor, stared in silence at David, bowed my head at the Pope's blessing on the crowd in Rome, gazed in wonder across the Swiss Alps, shuddered at Dachau, something deep inside me instinctively reached out to grasp someone's hand. And if I had left for my journey alone, there would have been no one to squeeze my hand back in reassurance of the reality of my humanity when faced with the majesty of the Alps or the perfection of David or the terror of Dachau.

      On Friday morning, I received an email from King's College London offering me a place in their MA in International Relations program.  I was shocked; I really didn't think I'd get in at KCL, and so really didn't think I'd actually have to make a decision between Edinburgh and London. There is some thrilling and surreal about this decision, though.  Grad school is something I have been working towards, and I was always optimistic about getting into a good school, but I think more out of the necessity of motivating myself than an actual, sincere belief that I could get in.  It's more than just 'school' to me.  When I was in high school, I had the opportunity to take some courses during the summer at some amazing universities.  It opened my world; it showed me that the limits in my life were self-imposed, not a matter of course, and not intrinsic to who I was.  Learning and reading are starting points for change, for improvement, for freedom.  That's why this is so important to me... I'm going to begin the process of applying for a visa this week and continuing scoping out the living situation.

      Alright, the first entry.  A trial run.  In about a month, I leave for the University of Edinburgh in Scotland (so to differentiate it from all the other Edinburghs).  This is a pretty sure thing, unless the other school I applied to, in London, notifies me that they've finally accepted my application.  Even then, I think I'm set on Edinburgh.  It's still a big, culturally diverse city (heck, I'm in another country.  Everything will be a different culture to me), but I think I could more easily carve out a niche for myself in Edinburgh.  (I say this from my vast experience of having spent a total of about 5 days in Edinburgh, and that not all at the same time.)  And it's closer to mountains, which is what I will miss the most about where I live now.  It will be like my home of Tennessee, without the trailer parks.  Really, the city is beautiful; check out  urlLink http://www.ed.ac.uk/city/ .  The pic at the top of the page shows Edinburgh Castle on the left and what I believe is the point of the Sir Walter Scott Memorial on the right.   Edinburgh is a good school.  David Hume, Walter Scott, Joseph Lister (yes, the guy the mouthwash is named after), Robert Louis Stevenson and Arthur Conan Doyle went there.  I think that's a good sign.  I didn't apply until July, so getting in felt like a stab in the dark, and I don't actually have a place to live yet.  I did find this, though:  urlLink http://www.edinburghstudentpad.co.uk/edinburgh/details.asp?houseref=5394 .  I'm not too sure about it (what is double glazing??  I hope it's not important, because the flat doesn't have it).  I have a friend in Edinburgh, &amp; I think I may have her check it out first.
