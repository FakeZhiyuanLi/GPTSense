      Today a large box arrived at our door. Oh yes. The bagpipes are here.  Two hours into our beginning lessons on the practice chanter, the neighbors looked severely worried. It was marvelous. We can't wait to uncork drones. Ooh, I just shiver at the malevolency of that phrase.  Uncork the drones!   Mike and I spent a rare afternoon together today. While Gavin napped under the watch of his grandmother, we slipped away and drove down to Aikahi to drop off Coke syrup. We felt like valiant heros, galloping to the rescue under 5 gallon boxes of the sugary goo, welcomed anti-climactically by a dark, empty theatre. We hope there will be much rejoicing tonight when the concession opens. From there, we took a scenic drive across the mountains to Honolulu, where Mike skipped eagerly into the music store to pick up his new amp, his early birthday present to himself. We meandered about until we arrived at Costco, a holy horror this day-before-4th of July. As we valued our lives, we swung around and fled, laughing triumphantly at the fools cramming themselves into the parking lot. Our mission accomplished, we returned home to feast on low-fat hot dogs and high-fat potato chips. Gavin narfed 4 toddler "meat" sticks ('Unique stick shape is easy to hold!' boasts the label) and assaulted the cat before dragging his Grannie outside, where he is presently amusing himself by sweeping the porch. Perhaps tonight Mike and I will continue our lovely day together by enjoying Spiderman 2, despite the preview in which Tobey Maguire declares that his suit gives him a wedgie.   A very satisfying Saturday.

      Last night, my mother decided that she would please the mormon ladies she works with by concocting a giant Jello desert for an upcoming baby shower. It was my duty, of course, to make certain the Jello creation - a lovely "bavarian" of lime Jello infused with heavy cream - was not poisonous. Perhaps it wouldn't have been, had I not eaten half a pound of it. To make matters worse, my mother is currently enamored with a no-bake cheesecake recipe which requires copious amounts of unflavored gelatin. She made another one last night, substituting high-fat for low-fat cream cheese, and insisted I sample the thing despite my near-death experience with the bavarian. Thank goodness I wasn't at that baby shower today, or I might not be here to speak of it.  Oh my poor stomach.

      As everyone knows, Christmas is practically upon us. So naturally, I've found it is time to begin designing my holiday cards. I have been reading a book on the art of  Alex Ross , and was inspired to create a design in a similar style, based on a super hero developed by my beloved web board. So I found myself in the bathroom, perched atop a plastic stool wearing a swimsuit, a nursing bra, a pair of Supergirl underwear, and a towel tied around my neck, supporting a digital camera on my head. Upon the unfortunate discovery of the photos later in the day, Mike and my mother had the grace and tact to stifle their sniggers before I poked their eyes out with my mechanical pencil. Gavin chose to draw on my new reference with a stump of banana, but as I am now completely out of printer paper, it will have to do anyway.  Michael, the innovative manager that he is, has taken it upon himself to paint the lobby and concession of his theatre. He has organized the funds, rounded up victims to help paint, and today we took a trip to Home Depot in search of paint and supplies. To my amazement, there were beautiful men everywhere, and I had a sudden, powerful urge to pinch bottoms. A genuine God sat in the carpet department, such an amazing example of muscle and chisled classic looks that even Mike was impressed. We weren't sure why such a creature would work at Home Depot when he should so obviously be kicking Brad Pitt out of Troy or posing for comic book characters. I really must work on my home improvement skills. I can think of at least a dozen household projects that need to be done, each requiring a separate visit to the carpet department at Home Depot.   If any bottoms are to be pinched, however, I am lucky to have such a fine one at hand. Mike, having gained an astounding 5 pounds since high school, decided he needed to work out more often. We bought him a new pair of running shoes, a few pairs of new shorts (rather short ones, too, as I saw to it) and off he went. There is hardly a nicer sight in the world than Mike, fresh from his daily run, shining with sweat and muscles quivering, his hair in damp bronze ringlets. He complained that tourists stared at him, as though they had never seen a white person in Hawaii before, and I had to chuckle at his innocence.

      The rain has been sweeping over the mountain all day. We left this morning to visit the Financial Aid office at UH in the hopes that some light may be shed on this enigmatic loan process. In the past, the financial aid officers at UH have been utterly unhelpful and downright rude. The last time I visited, I politely inquired about information on scholarships, hoping to apply for the next year. "You know its too late for this semester, don't you?"  snapped the woman at the desk, not moving to hand me any papers. After ten minutes of defensively justifying my motives, I left with a thin pamphlet and a deep grudge. Today went no better.  "I'd like some information about the loan process," I said. "You have to fill out the FAFSA," said she, turning away as though she wished I would leave. "I did, what now?" "Did they send you a letter?" "Not yet, what do I do when I get the letter?" "They have to give you a letter first." "OK, then what?" "Most people apply for financial aid when they apply for admission." "Well I didn't, so what's the next step?" "They have to process your FAFSA."  At this point I throttled the woman. We left with no further information on the loan process, hoping that the mysterious authorities processing my FAFSA would make things clear in time for registration.  We ate lunch at the food kiosk by the chemistry building. I poked quarters in the machine until a bowl of fried rice popped out, and we sat on a stone bench, surrounded by two dozen softly peeping doves and sparrows. An enormous white pigeon perched on Gavin's knee, which simultaneously horrified and delighted him. He gripped my leg for courage and slowly extended a hand toward it. Such a serious boy. After lunch, I watched him run through the grass, picking up flowers which had dropped from the trees, and I felt so proud.  After a stop at the school book store, we came home with a bottle of spray fix, a fine-tipped pen, a sheet of illustration board for my latest endeavor, and a parking ticket.   Such a mix of contentment and frustration, but being on campus was lovely, and I can't wait to start classes this fall.

      I've been thinking a lot about what constitutes quality of life. Obviously, happiness is the key, but what makes you happy? When my degree is finished, I'll be able to afford a nice big house on the mainland. A dream house is important, and certainly not attainable here in Hawaii, but what about other things? We have free swimming pools, a fine opera, ballet and symphony, a good birthing center, an art museum, wonderful bronze casting facilities, an active scottish community, and a quick walk across the street to see free movies at Mike's theater. But no hopes for anything better than a condo. Is that so bad? Or would we truly be happier in a nice big house in the country, far away from culture and art, but surrounded by mountains and rivers? What would we do for fun?  It's a tough call. We've been toying with the idea of moving to Scotland, Nova Scotia, or some other place that would offer tradition, language, and culture in lieu of personal luxuries.  Here Gavin enjoys some classic rock on his daddy's headphones:

         Several days ago, we looked out into the mele of the parking lot and counted fifteen children, each screaming hysterically. Our front door was being used as a soccer goal, scooters and bikes were discarded in the middle of the road, Stupid Head was screaming that he was going to run over them. The two-year old had climbed onto the roof of a truck and was jumping up and down with ear-splitting bangs as her mother stood six feet away, chatting obliviously with a neighbor. It was sheer chaos. This has been the scene for months, ever since the new neighbors with the three obnoxious children moved in. On top of this, the senile old lady next door continues to scream day and night about her obscene little dogs.     Yesterday my mother snapped. Our neighbor, the Teacher Guy, sat under our window playing his ukulele very badly, which prompted the screaming neighborhood kids to fetch their ukuleles and join him. Stupid Head popped the hood of his car and turned up his radio. My mother sat by the window louvres, white-knuckled and jaw clenched.   So we bought a set of bagpipes.   This morning, as the Teacher Guy sat by his car smacking a block of ice against the pavement at 5am, my mother woke with a wicked grin. She came downstairs, rubbing her hands in anticipation. The bagpipes will arrive any day, and then the neighbors will pay.      Oh yes, they will pay.

      I noticed recently that my actual pen-and-paper journal was filled entirely with horrific accounts of random events; I only picked it up to empty my misery into it. In fact, I'm not miserable at all, and I hope this journal reflects that.  This is the start. Last week, two significant events took place: I submitted my book to the publisher; and I was accepted into grad school. The rest of my life will be shaped by these two things. I can only hope for the best, but already I am inexpressably relieved and excited about the future. Hawaii suddenly gleams with happiness and possibility, and I am utterly content with life here.  Gavin is currently in love with a grungy old plastic dollhouse, which he insists must neatly contain a bed, a chair, a toilet, a little boy doll, and two dump trucks to wreck the whole of it. He has a small rash of bumps across his forehead as a result of last night's naked twirly time outside, where he spun himself around until dizzy, sprinted across the neighbor's porch, and took a head dive onto the concrete with a sickening smack. Brilliant. This masculine behavior was, thankfully, interrupted by a delightful period where he daintilly flung his plastic hammer to the ground, clapped his little hands to his cheeks, and declared "oh dear!" about seventy times. It never failed to be devastingly cute.  Here he is, a few weeks ago:

      Today we started the epic battle to remodel the house. Mike hopped up bright and early to haul our old couch to the dump and pick up a small, new TV stand - one made from wood rather than particle board. He was supposed to return with a borrowed table saw, but failed, as his victim was not home. Instead, he busied himself ripping off the cupboard doors from the kitchen, while my mother and I drove into town to buy paint.  In the midst of all this, my auntie dropped by with my cousin, Chris. I had a very unpleasant few hours of barking directives and physically restraining the boys as they hit, pushed, kicked, wrestled over toys, and lobbed rocks at each other. Gavin decided that if Chris could screech like a Nazgul, he could, too. Charming. The overwhelming balance, however, was on Chris' side. He is so relentless with his boundary-pushing that Gavin became all but lost amidst the cries of "Chris, no! Put that down, Chris! No throwing, Chris! I said NO! Chris, you get back here!" and the like. Naturally, what do children do to get attention if all the focus is on the rotten kid? They behave rotten as well. It's a horrific cycle, and I dread it when my auntie comes over with Chris. Pity, I would really like to have warmer feelings for my wee cousin, instead of restraining the urge to punt him. (On a side note, my auntie bragged extensively about how he's talking in full sentences and having conversations now, and he demonstrated his brilliance by yelling "buh-buh!" a hundred times while running in circles.)  So tomorrow we paint the kitchen. I emptied out the pounds of plastic grocery bags we had guiltily stowed under the sink, and I generously donated them to the supermarket recycle bin, with a few giant roaches thrown in for good measure. The puging feels good, and already the living room is transformed by the absence of the Dreaded Orange Couch and the addition of a proper piece of furniture for the TV and stereo. Gavin expressed his appreciation of the arrangement by hauling down some couch pillows and lounging naked on the floor. The boy has good sense.

      (It seems I have a lot to say today, doesn't it?)  Last night I heard a scrabbling in the kitchen. Silence. Scrabble. Rustle. Bang. Movement in the corner of my eye. The cats looked worried.  I crept into the hall nervously, hand twitching slightly as I reached for the light switch. Something was moving. Lots of somethings. The kitchen was writhing in the darkness. Pat. Rustle. Whirrrr.  I flicked on the light and gasped, the cats at my heels leaped backward and ran away in terror.  No less than  fifty  enormous, black, scrabbling B-52 cockroaches covered the kitchen. Easily 3 - 4 inches long apiece, they were on the ceiling, on the counter, skittering across the cabinet fronts, in the sink, flying through the air. All  were frantically crawling over each other, knocking over cereal boxes, opening cupboard doors, and eating with our cutlery. When they saw me, half a dozen lit off and flew straight at my head, fluttering like chickens. I ducked and weilded my weapon, a feather duster, smacking them out of the air with tiny muffled  thwacks . One clung to the feathers and ran for my fingers, but I flung the duster, roach and all, into the jaws of our bravest cat, the fearless Headlights the Kitten.   The first blow has been struck. Now we go to war. We have tried poisons, we have tried starvation, but I have found that the most effective means of disposing of roaches is to place empty cans of soda strategically about the house, and then simply throw them away in the morning when they are full of heavy, scratching, trapped roaches.   I don't know where they go during the day, but at night they hold a cockroach jamboree, which would be absolutely magical and delightful to witness if they were fairies instead of giant roaches. Really, life is not fair.  This is Harry, one of our actual cockroaches (in actual size):

      Pineapples are lovely. Grasshoper cookies are divine. Combine the two, listen to Harry Potter on audio tape while browsing the  urlLink lipstick librarian , and you're in for a delightful evening.  Mike has reminded me about 12 times today that he gets to paint his theatre on Tuesday. When, you ask? Tuesday! Which Tuesday? This Tuesday!  A couple of days ago, we watched  urlLink Cold Mountain , which is absolutely the most depressing and excruciating movie I have ever seen, including Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan. I liked it quite a bit, but I think I would much more enjoy reading the book. On the other side of motherhood, I find it much harder to watch a dying baby left to freeze to death than I did before. The movie featured many fine actors, all of whom had a wonderful opportunity to die brutally on screen.

      Today I finished my christmas card design. Amazing to think that someone as notoriously lazy as myself has actually accomplished something 6 months ahead of time. But then, I get caught up with this kind of thing. Behold, I have posted a part of it. A few dozen lucky rebel mamas can expect the full picture in their mail boxes this December - if I don't put it off until February. One can only look at this and snigger about the reference I had to take for it:     Great joy. Gavin had moderate success with the potty today. He pooped only feet from the actual potty, and promptly sat down on it while I picked turds off the floor. The victory lies in the fact that he now associates the potty with his body functions; now he must work on his timing. Also in Gavin news, he has been perfecting his pronounciation of the word "house". It is no longer a "how", but is a "houf". He makes the cutest scrunchy "f" expression with his lips while saying it. He also said "die-dah" when I held up his diaper. Alas, my name is still "dada", which is his favorite term for everything. Mostly he communicates through body language, beckoning with flapping fingers, pointing, or posing with jazz hands. He had a checkup yesterday, and the doctor prounounced him to be very tall, very healthy and heavy, very serious, focused, and quiet. She warned me of the evils of co-sleeping, and I laughed at her. I seriously doubt he'll still want to sleep with us when he's 16, so I'm going to savor his company as long as I can. He handled his vaccinations valiantly, suffering only a wail of dismay, and when offered a sticker for his troubles, I neatly avoided the one with a tank on it (which the nurse was proding encouragingly) and picked him a glittery silver one instead with the unfortunate word "Sweetie" across it in pink cursive. He likes shiny, so never mind the message.  I have tried to open discussion with Mike about moving to the mainland after I get my degree, but he has become comfortable here and refuses to talk about it. If it weren't for the fact that he enjoys winter so much, I wouldn't have gotten anywhere with him. He has agreed to take a road trip to scout out prospective homesteads next summer. He's still heartbroken about leaving all his friends in New York, and is really reluctant to abandon his beloved co-workers now. Maybe I'll feel the same once I make friends at grad school. Gavin could do worse than to grow up surfing and eating plate lunch.  A lot to think about...

      The day got worse, then surprised us all.  I received a letter from the university about the Children's Center. They wanted $2000 a semester for day care. Every day, from 8am - 5pm. I only need two mornings a week, I certainly don't want him there all day, and I absolutely couldn't afford it anyway. It was all irrelevant, however, as Gavin does not turn 2 before September 1st, and couldn't be admitted, anyway. I crumpled up the letter and decided to move to Finland.  My mother went to the dump with the crap from the back of the truck, in an effort to get the truck ready to ditch/sell/roll into the ravine. I gave up and plopped Gavin in front of Blue's Clues while I made dinner. The heat was intense, despite the smattering of rain that failed to darken the sky. Just as I flicked off the stove and called Mike down to dinner, the power went out.  Mike wailed upstairs. His unsaved hour at work was wasted in a blink. He trudged downstairs, defeated. I dished him up a plate of beef thai curry, and we sat to dinner. Outside, the obnoxious children screamed and cried about the power. I expect their video games crapped out. They flooded into the parking lot to wreak havok as orcs and shield maidens.  My mother came home to the powerless house, and we laughed a tired laugh and salvaged the beer and ice cream from the dark fridge. Mike picked up the bagpipe chanter and began his first lesson. To our astonishment, he took to it. He loved it. He worked through the lesson book, intensely interested and encouraged. Gavin danced. It's just like Mike to excel at unusual things. First the scottish dancing, then the highland, now bagpipes. This man is a Scot, through and through.  When the power came on, I cried out in joy and danced a happy dance. At that moment, the cd player kicked on behind me and unexpectedly emitted a loud, soaring, victorious chorus that echoed my enthused bouncing and sent my mother and Mike into roars of laughter. Gavin clapped and danced along.  The truck is dead, the trees are doomed, and the milk is warm, but we have music, love, and laughter (and leftover curry!) so all is right in the world.

      I'm so terribly sad and angry.  We received notice just now that our parking lot is going to be under construction tomorrow morning. They plan to rip up the "islands" of grass and trees in order to make our parking spots bigger. There is a towering, giant Norfolk pine that will die tomorrow so the SUVs can park more spaciously. As well as half a dozen small, swaying palm trees, and large areas of breezy grass. In their place, we will be blessed with a shimmering expanse of asphalt. My heart hurts.  To make matters worse, we have two and a half hours to find someone to tow our truck, which failed to awaken when we tried to start it. Kidney Cars won't accept it, and it's way too heavy to push, though we may try anyway.   Yesterday a man with a white mask came by to spray poison on all our doorfronts. No warning, no explanation. No time to remove our babies, or close the windows, or make sure our cats are safe. La-di-da, poison and asphalt for everyone. It's the American way.

      Our neighbor is playing his ukulele outside our window again. I'm sorely tempted to pick up the chanter and make some noise, but I'm terribly tired. Today Mike, Gavin and I drove down to UH to pay the cursed parking ticket, with full intentions of stopping by the Children's Center to check out the facilities for Gavin. We did not. After an hour of hiking all over campus, we limped back to the car and melted, our bellies churning uncomfortable from an unusually bad lunch at the food kiosk. I had sat, eating my tough pieces of meat (debating quietly as to whether it was horse or cat meat - I somehow imagine cat meat to resemble chicken, but it is a red meat after all... I digress) and I gazed whistfully up at the sun-dappled stairs of the Hamilton Library, in whose bowels I will live like a troll for the next year and a half.   Safely home, Gavin and I played on the porch with his kitty litter box filled with cool water. He tip-toed on the hot cement, and then crammed his body into the box to splash happily while I hovered over him, my shadow shielding him from the blazing sun, and my back burning. I'll miss these days. I had a vision, suddenly, of myself on a bike, Gavin riding behind me in a baby seat, as I cruised toward his day care center to drop him off for my class, then riding on to the library, then picking up the boy and gliding down to the lovely olympic-sized heated pool for an afternoon swim. Perhaps I'll ask for a bike for my birthday, it's been so long since I've been on one.  My mother returns now from the store, with the fixings to make fresh fudge, which she has been longing for these past two days. As she's suffering from a severe migraine, we've decided that this sounds like a good pain-killer.  Ah, life.

      Yesterday we had a very satisfying day. Inspired by the excuse to make something summery and special, Mike and my mother decided to dust off the ice cream maker and make some ice cream. We spent the first half of the day battling the hordes at the grocery store to purchace ice, salt, and cream, then languished through the afternoon drinking beer to the soothing purr of the ice cream beaters. I whipped up some potatoes, boiled eggs, bacon, mayo and avacado into a potato salad, put the fresh corn on to boil, and my mom grilled up some steaks. Mike was especially enthused by these proceeds, as there is nothing he likes better in the world than meat, corn, and ice cream (throw in my famous potato salad and he's all smiles).  Mike ran off to work with a full belly, while Gavin and I seated ourselves on the curb outside to watch our noisy neighbors set off fireworks. Gavin was fascinated and concerned at first, but as soon as a spinning firework exploded into a shower of sparks which caused the neighbor kids (standing too close, naturally) to jump back screaming, he cried in fear and pulled me by the thumbs back indoors, shutting the door behind us. For the rest of the evening, every time he heard a crackle or bang, he scowled and pulled us away from the windows. As he nursed to sleep, he whimpered sleepily and covered his eyes at every pop. Thankfully, he is a sound sleeper, and was unperturbed for the rest of the festivities.  Mike came home at around 1am, and woke early to attend an RSCDS meeting. As he measured the cupboard doors (one of the RSCDS members is selling us wood for new cabinets) he told me about a fascinating phone call he received at the theater. An elderly woman had called to inquire about Farenheit 9-11, and had gone off on a lengthy tangent about how deeply she loathed Dubya, ending a half hour later with the announcement that all politicians are actually lizard aliens (you can tell by the way they cock their heads while they talk) and that one day they will awake in their true forms and reveal themselves to us all. At least, that's what she prays every night. Mike loves his job.

      After disposing of the bag-o-roaches, we sat in smug superiority on the couch to enjoy our evening.  "Did you put away the macaroni?" asked my mother. "Why, naturally not, mother," replied I.  As she entered the kitchen, my mother was assaulted by airborn roaches. She ran for the macaroni, and, as she dashed to the fridge, was struck viciously in the head by one of the infernal beasts, which then dropped into the bowl of macaroni and scampered away with a handful of noodles.  We drew up schematics for a catch-and-release program involving little mesh traps and an ebay account, but, in the end, decided that today we would just buy roach motels. The big ones, the size of shoe boxes. Then we'll see who's boss around here.

      After my dramatic purge of the nefarious roach-dwelling cupboards, there has been no food for the poor dears to feast upon. Except for one thing.  My mother just opened the bag of dry cat food to discover a gigantic horde of shiny brown roaches crammed into it, huddled together in a solid mass. It was with grim pleasure that she dragged the scrabbling bag outside and banished the wee beasties into the gorge. They ran like rats fleeing a sinking ship as she spanked the bag.  BWAHAHAHAHAHA! Roaches, flee for your lives! We are free at last!

       Gavin makes a friend  The little girl up the street has been suffering boredom since her friends next door moved away, and has suddenly glombed on to Gavin. After running us down as we returned from the grocery store, she has hardly left all afternoon. I'm unaccustomed to older children, but I've been taking notes from my mother's interactions with her. 15 years of elementary teaching has taught her a thing or two about kids.  So Gavin has started learning the basics of friendship with a girl who is old enough to teach him how to share, pretend, and stay out of harm's way. Much better than Chris, who only teaches him the finer points of shrieking and pushing.   10 things I hate about you   It's important to know one's faults, so that one can aspire to improve one's self throughout life. Allow me to list some of my more prevalant flaws, since Mike has been so kind to point them out recently.  • I sing, which technically makes me a singer. Michael refers to my vocal style as "singing like an egg" - because, of course, eggs can't sing. My original creations include 'an Ode to Broccoli', 'My Icky Kicky Licky Bicky Baby', and 'I Love Your Feet'. I prefer to sing while cooking, showering, or watching Mike concentrate.  • I drive very carefully. I insist that everyone else drive carefully, as well. If it helps, I may tightly grip the driver's thigh around a precarious turn. If anyone around us is driving poorly, I will do my best to alert everyone of it. Often, other people don't know which lane to be in, so I offer friendly directives.  • I drink tea. Tea bags drain nicely in the sink, but I prefer other people dispose of them in the garbage, as it may spoil my appetite for my tea. If the sink isn't handy, a counter may suffice.  • Clean laundry makes a nice cat bed, so I try not to fold it and put it away for as many days as possible.  • Loved ones shouldn't have zits, so I help them out. When faced with protests, force may be used. Grooming is important, you know.  • I have the amazing ability to power-belch, which Mike claims is inappropriate even if only a handful of strangers are nearby. Or only himself, for that matter.  Hrmm... I suspect I can shell out another 4 flaws or so fairly easily, but flaws are debatable, aren't they? 'Flaw' may be just another word for 'skill'.

      Bah, I'm just in a foul mood today.  Michael has been away for two days, fixing up the theatre. He came home just a short while ago, and is sitting outside filing the edges of our new cupboard doors before installing them. My mother is chatting with him. Gavin is watching Blue's Clues.   I feel so bored. So inadequate. Of course, the movie I wanted to go watch is no longer in the theatre, and social conditioning prohibited me from eating the whole container of Ben and Jerry's.  I never had PMS before I had a baby. Sheesh, this is ridiculous. What is this, day 3?  On the bright side, Sal called today, confused my mother ("Who's Charles?"), and spoke with Mike for a full 30 seconds before hanging up and promising to call back. Naturally, I ducked under the couch when the phone rang, because I have an irrational fear of phones, and the suspense is killing me. Will he ever call back?

      My habitual self-loathing is pure indulgence.  Gavin is such a marvel. It's a pity I came out of it with tears in my skin, but that is such a ridiculously small price to pay for creating such a perfect little body and soul. I've never met anyone as wonderful as him, and I feel so damn lucky to get to see him grow from babyhood.

      I have a feeling that nobody reads this, and so I'll take a chance and get something out in written words so that I can look back on it later.  I preach love and acceptance of your body. I point an angry finger at the patriarchy for making women vomit to keep themselves thin. And even so, I look in the mirror and feel ashamed. Last night, I stayed up and watched Road Rules. My eyes flickered longingly over the thin teens, I had fleeting thoughts of buying TrimSpa so I could look like Anna Nicole Smith in her commercials. By the end of the night, I had made a vow of starvation and executed dozens of crunches. I had fantasies of waltzing into my high school reunion in three years and making Justin Miguel remember why he gave me that half-naked picture of him.  It could be worse. Last year I felt like dying. My stretch marks from giving birth were angry and red. I had lost only 15 of the 42 pounds I had gained. My hair was falling out. I watched Mike and Peter and Chrysa swim, tanned and lean and uninhibited, and I felt a deep sickness and self-loathing. I was sure I would never be attractive again, doomed to be fat and pale and tired forever.   In the past year, I lost two more pant sizes. My stretch marks faded. My hair grew back. I have a tan, I wear shorter skirts. Still, I feel shapeless and ugly most of the time.   Today, I started my "diet". I picked at a scrambled egg. Drank tea for a snack. Felt guilt as I ate a sandwich at lunch. By dinner, I was so disheartened that I allowed my mom to feed me a tv dinner and ice cream. Just fucking great, now I have to start over. And I know this is all wrong.  I look fine. I'm healthy, I'm slowly losing weight as Gavin continues to nurse. I know I should love myself, and by and large I'm far more accepting of my body than I was before I had a baby. But still, I find myself running my fingers over my torn skin and trying not to cry in horror. I stand in the mirror and pinch the permanant bulge of baby belly that throws my figure out of balance and makes me look like a pear. I look at pictures from my teens and remember being able to dress however I liked and know that the boys would look as I walked by. I feel surges of anger at the people who told me I was fat in high school, when I was muscular and tanned and on the swim team.   I know it's wrong, but I hate myself a lot of the time. And I don't know how to really get over it.

       Day 3 of the kitchen fiasco.   Yesterday I spent half the day gutting the cupboards and waging war on the cockroach hordes. I mercilessly threw out every remotely perishable item in the back of the cupboards, chucking out two garbage bags full of cake mixes, flour, granola bars, baby food, oatmeal, and pasta, among other food stuffs in various stages of decomposition. I smashed nests of roach eggs, I swept up their refuse, bleached away their pheromones, and chased them with a pair of tongs (didn't catch any, but scared them good).  After the downstairs bathroom had been filled with kitchen goods, I opened my paint cans and armed myself with rollers. Pale ivory went up on the cupboards, a mossy green on the wall. The brand of paint we used seems particularly creamy, with the appearance of melted ice cream. Vanilla and mint, it's all I can do to keep from licking the walls.  It would seem to be a simple task, painting a wall, but it isn't. We had to drag everything away so I could reach, and behind the couch, the shelves, and the computer desk, we found an astounding array of lost items and an entire archaeological site of ant refuse. It was astounding. And now, unwilling to shove all the garbage back under the furniture and stack the piles of old mail back on the wall shelves, I have committed my day to purging. Already, an enormous garbage bag of old mail and catalogs is sitting beside me, and the place looks remarkably less cluttered. A large pile of recycling towers beside the door, awaiting Mike's return with the car for a trip to the recycle bins. Mike and my mother have slipped down to Home Depot to buy another board for the new cupboards, and Mike intends to buy goodies at Costco while he's down there for his painting party at work tomorrow.   Gavin's Dream  Throughout all this, Gavin has amused himself with his Grannie, who can't inhale the paint fumes or she will fall over dead. She took the kiddo to the mall, and bought him an amazing substance which has excited him to no end: PlayDoh. We expected him to go nuts with it, but instead he sat quietly and poked it, rolled it between his fingers, and then busied himself with picking it off his hands. This kid hates having dirty hands.  Last night he had a nightmare, and cried piteously in his sleep. I rolled him over, rubbed his side, and cooed at him as he calmed down. He didn't wake up, but moaned grieviously, and whimpered, " 'tuck!"  Poor thing, I wonder where he was stuck.   The Very Stupid Man   When I modeled at WCC, there was always a man who stood out. For whatever reasons, when my eyes fell on him, I invariably thought  creep . The sort of man you wouldn't want to stand too near to you. Somehow, my auntie has seen fit to rent a room in her house to this man, and he came over yesterday to help my mother fix the truck. He came at nightfall, forcing them to work in the dark. He insisted she needed a jump, though she told him repeatedly that the battery was 3 days old and brand new. He insisted that a starter motor was the same as a solanoid. When the engine failed to turn on his first attempt to start it, he tried another 80 times before my mom told him to stop. He electrocuted himself once, tried to do so again by laying live jumper cables on the hood of the truck. My mother began to fear for his life in this effort as much as she feared for the truck. And he bragged. He would have been a famous rock star if people hadn't screwed him over. A famous artist. A great mechanic. He made none-too-subtle hints about money. Hoping to earn more money by stalling, he helped my mom carry the jack into the house, and promptly gouged one of my freshly painted walls. I stayed very still on the couch, hoping he wouldn't see me, but he did. He politely acknowledged his recognition of me by expounding on every detail he knew of my life, which was far more than I was comfortable with. My skin crawled as he pointed out how he had often seen me modeling. I thought to myself,  if ever I were to be raped or murdered, here is the suspect.    So for anyone who may be reading this journal of mine, be warned. If ever a grisly fate befalls me, you know who to point at first.

      I went in search of the buzzing again. I walked slowly into the drone, and looked up to see dozens of bees buzzing from flower to flower on the enormous tree behind our house. I called my mother over to look, and she exclaimed, "We're blessed!"  Perhaps not all buzzing leads to carnage, and perhaps sometimes you have to look up hoping for the best instead of looking down expecting something dreadful.  I was still sullen and angry today, brooding all night over things I should have said, remembering things that were said to which I could take issue. I imagined confrontation scenarios with everyone around me. "Hey lady, why don't you put some pants on your kid when you take him to the store?" "Don't you tell me how to raise my children, you don't have kids," "Oh yes I do, and I would never be rude enough to bring him out in public half naked.." from which point the imaginary argument became racial and degraded into irate babble. My mother, detecting my problem, bought me a bottle of Irish Cream.  I watched the offending neighbor lady today as she actually stood and supervised her children while they played. I wondered if she was inviting us to come out and resume our argument.  Perhaps she was only pointedly demonstrating that she was an alert parent. Whatever her motives, we were pleased to see she was actually watching them for a change. Funny thing, they were much better behaved. Who would have guessed?    With regard to certain New Yorkers who are not all the same, I would have to say that so long as said persons were not living in New York and offering to let me sleep in a dank basement while holding hateful conversations about me directly above and within earshot, I would be happy to come visit at some point. Otherwise, I would invite those persons to go jump in the Hillburn pond.   I told Mike that we should go live in the country on the mainland, and he sighed and leaned back, turning his face into the afternoon light to gaze at the mountains, and said "I just can't imagine living anywhere but here." It makes me so happy to see him content, but I fear we will have to leave before Gavin is old enough to have the Aloha Spirit wring him by the neck.  I'm considering reading up on Buddhist philosophy to deal with life. I get very tired of reading  philosophy that deals with the meaning of life, which I feel is fruitless. Rather, I'm interested in the philosophies of living. I may lack spirituality, but I still want to be a better person. Without any real suffering at hand to help shape my character, I suppose I need a book or two instead.

      Ugh.  It states clearly in our condo rules that no excessive noise whatsoever is allowed that may disturb the other owners' peace and enjoyment of their home. No balls. No bikes or scooters or skateboards anywhere in the parking lot or sidewalks. We have a playground.  Today, Nikko was again playing ball in the parking lot. We heard him say to the other kids "Wanna play scooter soccer?" and proceeded to kick balls toward our home. As the ball skidded up to our walkway, my mom stepped out and said "Nikko, am I about to get a free ball?" with an arch of her eyebrow. He nodded 'no' and scootered away.  A moment later he was at it again, so she stepped out and said "Are you doing it again?" and he shook his head 'no' obstinately and started to rush away. "Excuse me, you don't just ignore me when I've asked you to stop playing ball," said my mom as she walked after him. He called over his shoulder that his mom wanted to talk to her, so she said "Fine, let's go right now," and went after him.  I stood with Gavin for a few minutes until I heard yelling. We walked over and found both Nikko's parents glowering and yelling at my mom, who was standing with her hands on her hips looking angry.  It got worse. They yelled about how she can't tell them how to raise their kids, they know where their kids are every minute of the day, and they reprimand Nikko when they need to because he's not perfect. "Oh," my mother countered, "so you know when they're behind my house and standing on my porch and you're ok with it?" The mom sputtered and said she'd tell them to stay away then, if she didn't like it. After the dad barked at my mom from behind the screen door, my mom asked him to come out because it was rude. At one point the mom started to tell her to shut up, but caught herself mid-word. The other neighbor joined in, yelling about how everyone tells him his kids are damaging their cars and "show me the damage, show me the damage". They insisted that unless there was actual damage, we should tolerate the kids throwing balls, and that social ettiquette decreed it unsuitable for people to complain before damage was done. Call the police then, file a lawsuit, they said (all so their kids don't get told not to bounce balls at our cars and houses? Does it really have to come to that first?). My mother told the third party that he was actually doing a good job managing his kids, that the noise was actually decreasing from them and that their kids don't bounce balls, and so he limped away (his foot is injured) looking unhappy. "Where's the aloha spirit?" he wailed as he left. (I'll tell you where, I had it jammed up my ass every day of high school. As far as I can tell, he was exhibiting "aloha spirit" very well by coming out to yell at us.)  So, after being accused of hating kids, trying to control their play so we could maintain our "boring" life, and being told that "supervision" does not mean maintaining visual contact with your kids and making sure they're behaving (that is the definition, isn't it?) we left feeling pretty pissed off. At least by the end of it, they had calmed down enough to tell us to just come to them when we have a problem (so their kids don't have to be respectful of adults and can do whatever they want otherwise?) and we said we would. Meanwhile, Nikko was in the background telling a neighbor that he was just playing ball and that lady came out screaming at him. I told him in no uncertain terms that she absolutely was  not  screaming when she came out and asked him to stop.  We have a copy of the rules. If it comes up again (which it will) we can simply read them aloud. It even states that it is the homeowner's responsibily to enforce the rules on their own before taking official action, so we are  not  unreasonable to ask them to stop behavior that is clearly against the rules. In the meantime, we'll call the manager tomorrow to report this. And if it's a lawsuit they want, I'll start taking pictures every time their kids are out there with balls and scooters. Great.   I hate drama. I just want peace and relative quiet. Laughing kids are nice to hear. Sceaming helions on wheels weilding balls is another thing entirely. It really makes me want to move to the country. (When we said that it was reasonably quiet before they moved in and that the noise went up dramatically when they moved in, they cried "GOOD!" because, of course, we are child-hating nazis who just want a boring life. Bah. Hello, we have a kid. And unlike them, we will teach him how to fit into society and think about other people instead of expecting everyone to let him do whatever he wants and be cocky about his right to do it.) But, hey, it's aloha spirit, after all. Kids will be kids, so long as you know their general location, you don't have to care about how they're behaving or actually show them how to play nicely. ("Oh, what's YOUR definition of playing nicely?" they snapped. Hello? Hopscotch, jumprope, pretend, tag, leapfrog, ANY play that doesn't involve screaming and throwing balls at cars, maybe? Sheesh.)  Okay, I feel better now. What a tirade, eh? We ended up at the bookstore at the mall to fume quietly, because the swimming pool was closed for some reason. My mom, seasoned by years of parent-teacher conferences, calmed down quickly, but I only get angrier as time goes by, and I didn't even participate in the event, only witnessed it. I guess that's how it goes with me. I'm angrier than ever about the events in New York this past winter. I'll be damned if I ever set foot there again. It will take a funeral, nothing less (including weddings). >8[

      I just received e-mails from two people: the editor of Mutual Publishing, inquiring as to whether I was interested in illustrating for them; and the editor of Mamalicious Magazine (my friend), thanking me for the illustrations I submitted for the next issue. What do you know? Looks like I may have a career in illustration after all.

      I hear an ominous buzzing. It's the sound of flies, masses of them, a sound that will stop you dead in your tracks in an open field as you scan for carnage. I've looked for the source of this sound for days, peeking over the hill into the gorge behind our house, searching for the telltale swivel of a buzzing fly that will lead my eye to the carcass. There isn't any. Perhaps a corpse will float up in my life somewhere else, then. Something I had forgotten for a long time, rising reeking to the surface.  More painting, more spots on the floor dabbed up with my fingers. I'm green today.   Last night, we rented "Love Actually", which was a wonderful movie. I'm a little sore today about the fat jokes, and I'm thinking moodily about fat in society. Old Navy (which I should not support anyway) has created a Plus Size section, which means that fat people will no longer be able to have their pick of all the stylish clothes to wear, but will be shunted off into a corner to pick over a small selection of approved garments. As someone who falls neatly into the crack between "regular" and "plus size" clothes, I can be guaranteed to have nothing to wear at all. Fuckers. Instead I get to wear my mismatched clothes and see Mary Kate Olsen staring dolefully out of all the magazines at me, glamorizing annorexia and causing involuntary images of myself retching into a toilet. I'm once again considering my old notion of living as a hermit in the mountains.  We spent a glorious afternoon at the pool yesterday, and Gavin dunked himself for the first time. He struggles to escape us now, certain he can swim like a fish if we would just let go. We compromise and set him loose on the stairs, where he crawls on his belly through the water and jumps in deeper and deeper until he clings to the wall and dangles freely. We returned home to find the neighbor girl pressed up against our screen door. That child is bored, and I can't say I like our family privacy invaded on a daily basis. I'm learning to manage her.

      The following is a shameless, tiresome brag-fest about my darling son.  The neighborhood children became intolerable again this afternoon, so we walked across the street to visit the grocery store in search of a distraction. Gavin, who had been mysteriously refusing food all day (opting instead to yank my breasts out in public for several long snacks at the mall), stopped suddenly in front of Loco Moco, squealed in delight, headed straight in, and pulled up a high chair. Indulgent and in no hurry, we made ourselves comfortable and ordered Gavin a large plate of macaroni salad, his favorite. He proceeded to woo us with his charm as he munched happily and sang us excerps from Blue's Clues. A large mirror covered the wall across from him, and he discovered that he could see his chewed food if he opened his mouth wide enough. "Teeth!" he proclaimed in delight, "Aaaaah!" (jazz hands).  Such is the life of an only child with a doting grannie on hand. After dinner, he ran happily around the grocery store, clapped his hands to his cheeks and cried, "Oh dea! No bahs!" when he discovered that the ball bin had been moved. When he was tired, he said "up", and snuggled his head against my neck to rest on the way home. I tugged on his diaper and jammies, and the wee boy curled up against me to sleep immediately. He takes after his father, never complaining about an opportunity to sleep. Last night he slept 7 hours straight before needing to nurse - hoorah for my sore nipples! Let's hope for the same tonight.  Also in Gavin news, he has started nodding "yes" when asked questions. He simply stares when the answer is "no", but we're making progress. He also declares "pee!" and points to his diaper, for obvious reasons. He's really starting to communicate. He even called me "mama" today, for the first time, requesting my water bottle ("wah?"). *swoon*  I know it doesn't sound exciting, but it really, really is. I absolutely love seeing Gavin grow and learn every day. He's amazing..

      Our Big Fucking Mess has reached it's peak.  I painted two more walls today, and attempted to paint the spice rack while I was at it. Mike continues to labor in the kitchen. This all means that everything in the living room has been spilled and displaced in my efforts to move them away from the wall, and Mike has taken apart the kitchen drawers, spewing their innards all over the counters. My mother helpfully broke a tea pot while trying to remove plants from my painting area, so we are watching out for glass shards as well. On top of this, dying roaches litter every corner. Any hopes for peace and order are abandoned.  If that wasn't enough, we were, for a short time, the proud owners of a giant, squishy leather couch. This was bought for $50 from our moving neighbor, and took up residence in the middle of the living room, approximately 2 feet from the tv, where all we camped out until Mike's friend relieved us of it this morning. My hatred of leather couches is somewhat lessened after falling asleep in it's squashy goodness, cradled like a baby in a big brown cow pouch.   Mike installing a drawer front:   Cupboards before:     Cupboards after:

      The boy I met at the age of 18 has just hit 25. It's hard to belive it's been 7 years already.   Mike slept in after a long night at work while my mother and I went to buy ingredients for his cake. First, though, we had to stop at the chiropractor, whereupon my mother spent an hour bargaining over the cost of her treatment and ultimately sold me to her doctor in payment. Yes, she emerged with a sheepish grin and said "I knew you wouldn't begrudge your mother a healthy back..." And so it was that I became obliged to illustrate a book by April in exchange for $2000 worth of chiropractic work for my dear mother. It took me by surprise, but I really don't mind the opportunity to submit another book for publishing. Clever mother.  By noon, we were home with cake goodies, and Gavin was out for a nap. Encouraged by his inactivity and my mother's sudden preoccupation, Mike and I ran upstairs and spent some rare time together (wink wink, nudge nudge). Alas, gone are our wild college days, for when confronted with the opportunity to take a shower together for the first time in three years, Mike and I decided that we'd rather not be crammed in together, taking turns under the water, and elbowing each other in the face while shampooing. Ah, adulthood.  Filet mignon for dinner, followed by the glorious truffle cake and presents. Mike tore open his presents, pleasantly enthused about his new MP3 player, fiddling happily with his new pedometer, and running his hands over his ornate journal. He seemed a little put off by the one gift he actually requested; a small bottle of tequila with the notorious agave worm in the bottom. According to my online buddies, he's got to chew it, and hope he won't suffer days of debilitating diarrhea thereafter. Happy birthday, Mike!

      The night before last, we found Sumo Toad helping himself to cat food in the kitchen, so we chased him out and hoped he had not eaten any of the poisoned roaches which had been staggering around. Yesterday, we noticed a foul odor lingering in the kitchen. We snooped around the trash can for a dish of cat food that may have escaped us, but found nothing suspicious. We worried that a toad may have crawled under the stove and died of indigestion, we speculated that perhaps some large roaches had perished in the walls. It wasn't until today that I learned the terrible truth.   The smell was worse than ever. I took out a plastic bag and began loading the few items of recycling that were loitering around the garbage can. As I reached under the kitchen stool to pick up an innocent wine bottle, I realized I had hit paydirt. The green bottle lay on it's side, and as I picked it up, a putrid layer of black sludge slopped down in it. Through the dark glass, I could see wriggling. Horrified, I ran a bit of water in it to loosen the sludge, and, holding the reeking vessel at arm's length, carried it out behind the old tree and dumped it. What I found would have amazed and delighted any entymologist.   The maggots were huge and grey, wriggling and fat amidst an astounding collection of cockroach parts. There were the wings of at least a dozen full-sized tropical roaches. Presumably, they crawled into the bottle in search of the teaspoon or so of wine within, perhaps to quench a thirst induced by the poison. Perhaps there were fleeing the Sumo Toad. Twelve or fifteen of them crammed in atop each other and, unable to escape, died. All afternoon, my mother and I have been lured behind the tree by morbid fascination to peer at the squirmy pile. We can't see why the maggots haven't been eaten by the birds and praying mantis, but they have begun to change color, becoming a translucent orange. Some have already produced tiny flies, and the odor is overpowering. I have included a picture, in which you can see the maggots if you look closely. I can't begin to count the wings. Imagine, if you will, the sickening stench of rotting flesh as you examine it, for full effect.   This process has been an unusual way to overcome my fear of roaches, I must say.

      The noisy neighbors have relented. Bolstered by our very public outburst, other neighbors have started telling them off, too. My mother was surprised to find herself with mini-celebrity status, receiving grins and waves from all the peace-loving neighbors as she would walk by. We were somewhat dismayed to see that one of our good neighbors had had enough and put her house up for sale. That makes two houses for sale within two doors from us, and who knows what wildcards may move in next.  Today we had a family outing to the pool, where Gavin dunked and jumped and splashed merrily with his Grannie, and Mike and I wrestled and floated and smooched until we made the surrounding children barf. Afterward, we drove down to Kailua to see Mike's theater and go to dinner at Maui Taco. Stuffed full of delicious cilantro-laden food, we waddled over to the health food store to buy tea and cookies. Gavin narfed half a dozen organic chocolate-dipped animal cookies in the time it took us to drive home again. It was a really sublime afternoon. Gavin and Mike are now amusing themselves by popping the packing bubbles that encased my mother's delivery of the Lord of the Rings trilogy on audio cassette. Life is good.

      I succumbed to the lure of fitness and beauty yesterday, and joined Weight Watchers online. I feel somewhat embarrassed to admit it, as so many negative jokes are made about such programs and the people on them. I'm quite excited about it though; the online program has so many fun features and food tracking tools, it's like a game, one that will set me up for long-term lifestyle changes.   In an effort to earn myself some activity points for said diet, we tried to go swimming last night. Alas, the pool changed it's hours again, and we ended up wandering through the drug store for an hour (an activity which earned me 3 points anyway). Gavin, having slept for 3 hours that afternoon, was happy to run all about the store with me in pursuit, until at last he grew tired and we headed home for bed. I annoyed him quite a bit by refusing to let him throw everything within reach, and so he glowered at me from under his scrunched brow until I made the same face back at him and caused him to burst out laughing. He's been trying on these facial expressions to see how they work, which I feel is much preferable to temper tantrums. In most cases they work; I understand how he's feeling, talk to him about it, and generally come to a compromise. In this case he realized I was on to him, and we spent the next few minutes practicing angry faces while trying not to laugh. Then we practiced shock and surprise. He's so fun.

      The evil neighbors have been glaring at us for days. I've seen them huddling up together for long gossip sessions outside their homes, casting surrepticious glances at our front door. They stared venemously as we walked by, ignoring their children as they made backhanded insults about Gavin's hair.   "Is that a boy or a girl?" asked Kurt, knowing full well he's a boy, considering he asks every time he sees him. "Oh," he said sarcastically, "I couldn't  tell ." Stifling the urge to kick him in the ass, I merely shrugged and said "He just has long hair, like his dad."  We had wondered why they seemed to have such trouble getting over our altercation from last week, when it happened that my mother ran into Stupid Head's mother at the mailbox ("Stupid Head" is a term of endearment, in this case). She told us that, shortly after our very public argument, which all the neighbors had been eavesdropping on, the evil neighbors let their kids out with balls again. After having their car hit, one of the good neighbors came out, bolstered by out outburst, and told the kids to cut it out. When they refused, and another short argument with the parents ensued, the good neighbor called the manager. The manager gave them the business, but not two minutes after he left, they sent their kids straight out again in defiance. They truly believe that their kids have every right to run unsupervised and throw balls at our cars, you see. Truly, they are on a crusade. And so that very night, several of the good neighbors walked over to the monthly board meeting that was in session, and reported them by name. An official warning came to them by post, with the threat of fines for future transgressions. And so it is that the neighbors aren't sure who it was who reported them, but are suspicious of us because of our past incidents with them.   I must say, knowing that they suspect us of turning them in to the board makes me feel much better about being on the receiving end of their poisonous glowers. We may be innocent, but we are happy to take some of the credit for getting this all underway.  Mwah ha ha!

      Mike woke up yesterday, ready to get to work fixing the blasted kitchen drawer, only to find me snuggling down next to him with a sleeping baby. If that wasn't enough to deter him from starting up the table saw, the sheets of rain were. The temperature dropped, the mountain was obscured by heavy clouds; it felt like December. Despite this, when Gavin woke from his long, premature nap, we suited up and headed for the swimming pool. The only fools in Kaneohe, we had the entire pool to ourselves, watched by a sullen, soggy lifeguard. We swam in the rain, Gavin learned to spit arcs of water at his father, and we played a short game of boundary-testing as Gavin determined just how fast he could run or jump before we warned him. Afterwards, I took the wee boy into the shower with me, and he leaned back into the hot water and said "Aaah!" with a look of bliss on his face as I rinsed his hair. Despite the rain, it was the perfect, private family outing. In the evening, Mike wrestled with his son and discovered that Gavin could execute a perfect tumble. Gymnastics, here we come! After a long afternoon, Gavin dropped into bed and was asleep before I was finished singing him the first song.  It would have been nice to sleep so soundly, myself, but it was not to be. At 3:00am, an ominous yowl from outside woke me. Gavin nursed contentedly in his sleep, binding me to the bed, so I elbowed Mike and asked him to stop the cat fight before it woke the neighbors. As he stepped outside to scare off the wild cats, Xebo escaped and made a run for the bushes. I detached myself and sent Mike back to bed as I took over the search for the rogue cat, and as I stood looking out at the brightly-lit parking lot, I thought to myself  Surely we don't need so many damned lights on in the middle of the night.  No sooner had the thought passed my mind, than the power went out. Doused in blackness, I gave up on finding the cat and went back to bed. The neighbors somehow sensed the blackout, and woke to screech about it and shine a flashlight out onto the parking lot. Several hours passed, I dropped slowly back into sleep. Suddenly, the fan came alive, and the stereo downstairs emitted a high volume serenade by Kermit the Frog. My mother yelped and thundered downstairs to turn it off, her alarm clock chattering loudly enough to cue Gavin to wake for the day. 5:00am. "No way," I said firmly, closing the bedroom door and popping the child onto my breast. He allowed himself to drift back into sleep for another hour and a half before scrambling out of bed to face the day. I groaned and followed.   Some day I will get 8 hours of sleep, I must believe that.

      Cutting a tooth is always a time of excitement for toddlers and their parents. Sometimes it means inconsolable sobbing, sometimes it means unpredictable chomps to delicate mama anatomy, and sometimes it means tearing around at top speed and lobbing objects at a haggard parent. Gavin chose this last option, becoming a raging wee monster as soon as he started getting tired this evening. He sped around the grocery store, ripping books off the shelves, throwing sponges and plungers into the aisles like a man in a chase scene, trying to throw off his attacker. He shrieked and went limp when picked up, oozing from my grip and puddling onto the floor before springing up for a speedy escape. At home, I plunked him bodily into the bathtub, yelping in surprise and anger as he scooped up a cup of water and dashed it in my face violently. Determined to soothe the savage beast, I sang him love songs and rubbed his back with lavender baby wash, firmly stopping him from his repeated attempts to spit water over the edge of the tub. I held him down and brushed his teeth, noting grimly the white bulge of gums where his latest tooth threatens to break free. After half an hour of nursing, his kicks to my stomach became less and less frequent, his nipple tweaking subsided, until, at last, the plastic teletubbie rolled from his limp fist and he was asleep. Wet, bruised, and hoarse, I staggered downstairs, and here I sit. I can't believe some toddlers are like this every day. I am so lucky that our battles are, thus far, contained to the rare days when he is cutting a tooth, with months of peace and love making up the balance. I don't see how other mothers refrain from chucking their children out the window if they have to deal with this every day.  Good heavens. At least he was charming for the first part of the day, even bestowing me with three unsolicited kisses. I just hope he is able to sleep comfortably tonight, because my mother goes back to work in the morning, and there will be no help for me if I'm too tired. Must sleep.

      Yesterday was a study of boredom until last night, when, in honor of Mike's birthday, the four of us drove down to the Aloha Tower in pursuit of beer and chicken wings. Gordon Beirsch, the maker of Mike's favorite beer, was our destination. We mulled over the dinner menu for some time before opting for just beer and pupus. I helped myself to unlimited refills of their divine home-brewed root beer and dutifully demolished the calamari while my mother and Mike had enormous, frothy beers plunked in front of them. Mike went in favor of the dark "Dunkles" beer, my mother stuck with the Märzan. Four pints later, Mike had sampled most of the flavors on the menu, including the "seasonal" beer, rich in rancid banana goodness. Gavin ate a plate of buttered pasta, and then he and I explored the courtyard. Gavin stroked the bronze sculpture of a little hula girl, and engaged me in a thrilling game of "skidoo", aka "jump off the curb", for about half an hour. We browsed the art gallery, and Gavin stared deeply at the paintings, pointing out the moon, water, and trees for me. I checked in with the drinkers, happy to see them laughing with the Rockland-born waiter.  Mike becomes much more masculine as he drinks. His polite posture slumps comfortably, he cocks his finger in a "how you doin" gesture, and he flirts confidantly. It was refreshing to see him having such fun. At the end of the evening, I hopped in the car as the designated driver, and we cruised on home, singing loudly to the classic rock station as Gavin snoozed soundly in his car seat. Safely home, we sat in a stupor in front of "The Princess Diaries" until falling soundly into bed.  This morning, I woke to hear Gavin telling his grandma "I go get mama". Smoosh went my heart, and I leapt out of bed to swoop him up in my arms. The peace was momentary, as I was then faced with the uncomfortable task of devising a way out of babysitting Chris as my auntie and my mom went shopping. Gavin helped me greatly by sitting naked on my mother's bed and peeing through all the layers of her bedding, necessitating a trip to the laundromat. When Beth and Chris arrived to pick up my mom a short while ago, I smiled inwardly as I watched Chris thrash and scream in his mother's arms all the way out to the car. A near miss, that one.

      Had I known that merely posting in my blog and ratting out Mercury would result in the speedy delivery of my missing Aunt Flo, I would have posted earlier.  Despite our growing excitement of the possibility, we breathed heavy sighs of relief this morning when it became clear that I was definitely not pregnant.  Onward with the pill, school, diet, and dental proceedures! It's smooth sailing for now. Booyah, Mercury.

      Mercury is kicking my ass.  The days are crawling by. Late last week, I became alert to an odd fluctuation in my cycle, and since then, we have been nervously balanced on the edge of unfolding events. To put it simply, my period is late. We can't expect an accurate test until thursday or so.  I start school next week. I had intended to start the pill this month, ensuring that no babies be born until I am safely out of grad school with a secure job. I just dropped a fair bit of money on my diet program, thrilled to have lost 2 pounds in the first week, and daydreaming of regaining my younger figure. I am scheduled to undergo three arduous dental procedures next month, all of which necessitate painkillers that are not recommended for preggos, and none of which may be postponed for 9 months, as half of my bad tooth fell off last night. No way around it, this is a bad time to be pregnant.  Today, Mike accompanied me to the dentist's office for my preliminary examination and cleaning. On the way, we snapped at eachother over which gas pump to pull up to. After several minutes of stony silence, we kissed and squeezed hands, opening a discussion on this stressful situation. I feel like a burden sometimes. If another baby came along, and Mike became distressed and overwhelmed, I would shoulder the blame. My wheels are spinning, I'm scared. Mike is concerned more with the immediate uncertainty of it all, he will most likely feel better when we know for certain one way or the other. After the appointment, we stopped at the mall for an oil change, and the two of us forged into the baby section of Sears (locatedly, oddly enough, next to the auto section) and shopped for the hypothetical baby until we felt giddy with the possibility. Mike held his hands to his chest, cupping an imaginary infant, and said "What if it was a girl?" with a little smile on his lips. We rifled through the pink baby clothes, picking out the least barfy, and left with a little hope in our hearts. I do believe that, when in doubt, it is best to get excited about a possible baby, because I should hate to have my first knowledge of my baby be a time of misery. I want to tell my child with absolute certainty that I jumped for joy when I learned I was having them.  And so we plod on through the week, waiting for a sign.

      In less than a week and a half, I'll be attending orientation and starting grad school. This has been a source of great anticipation and endless frightening school dreams - the kind where you suddenly realize you forgot a class for the last semester and failed. Often taking place at Ringling, curse them.  Gavin, at 5:30pm, crashed in bed and is on his way to sleeping until dawn, having failed completely to take a nap today. I'm at a loss for entertainment, as the tv has lost it's appeal and I'm all storied-out with books and conversation. Even art seems tedious tonight. I'm having great fun, however, playing with my new diet toys, and I'm pleased to say that after only four days, I've lost two pounds. Amazing. I imagine myself as a slender librarian with a tight bun and a short skirt, with clever little glasses perched on my nose. I really must find some non-presciption glasses to make me look more learned. Preferably horn-rimmed, with little rhinestones in the corners. Oh yes.

      Yesterday, my mother and I abandoned Gavin with his father and went to orientation. The LIS program is located in the basement of the enormous research library at UH, and we felt our hearts skip as we trundled down the stairs into the chilly depths. Waiting for the students to all arrive, we set ourselves to the refreshments. I decided to be naughty and make a cup of Earl Grey, and deftly plucked up a peppermint tea bag instead, not realizing my error until it was to my lips. My mother laughed and decided to show me how to make a proper cup of tea, picking out the bag of Earl Grey I had been aiming for, and proceeding to pour hot coffee into it instead of water. Both of us proving too incompetent to make a cup of tea, we proceeded in to the class for orientation.  It was, surprisingly, quite interesting. I stumbled into this field merely because my mother and grandmother found it agreeable, knowing nothing of it at all, myself. As it happens, it seems to suit me quite well. Who knew? I was particularly intrigued by archiving, and the preservation of books.  I was foiled by my advisor, who did not recommend I take 4 classes, as I had planned. It appears that 4 classes, each requiring a 30-page paper, just may have been overwhelming. Gah. So 3 it is, and I will start on Monday, providing the Financial Aid office get my loan papers to me in time.   There are only 4 men in our class. One is a military fellow from Laos, who is preparing to go AWOL, as his orders came in 2 days ago, and he refuses to attend lock-down on Thursday. It will be interesting to see if his lawyer gets him off. One man is a large Hawaiian guy with tattoos and a big laugh, a professional photographer with 4 children. The other fellows are about my age, one is a skinny quiet kid, and the other is haole boy from the mainland who plays bass guitar. I plan to corner that one and twist his arm into playing with Mike. Mwah ha ha ha. Overall, the rest of the women in the class are amazingly fun to talk to, and many also have toddlers at home. Libraries tend to attract a similar sort of nerdy people, I think, and I can't wait to get to know them better. Already, I was huddled up with a woman named Eileen, comparing schedules to make sure we had some classes together. I always get along better with people about 20 years older than me, for some reason, but I have to say that there was a young woman from Oregon whom I found delightful. Skinny, with jerky hand gestures, hunched posture, and bucket hat pulled down to her eyebrows, she was sharp and clever and posessed of a wealth of perceptive opinions. I think this year is going to be wonderful.   In the end, we were terribly late coming home, and had to pick up Gavin from the theatre. I was so excited to see him after such a long day apart, but he seemed perfectly fine without me. Alas! My baby is growing up. All the same, he hugged me and cuddled up to nurse immediately. That night, I fell asleep while nursing him, and we snoozed soundly until morning (except for one or two incidences with a dive-bombing cockroach). Part of me mourns for my wasted drawing ability, and I couldn't help but to gaze enviously at the art building as I walked by yesterday, but I feel this is the right path. Sometimes I have to tell myself that more than once, but I'm beginning to believe it more and more.
