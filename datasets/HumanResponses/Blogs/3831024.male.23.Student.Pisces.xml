      spiderman 2. honestly it exceeded my expectations. all the fight scenes, good vs. evil kind of battles were expected, but was unexpected was the internal and external conflicts of a man. a young man. a spider man. he can beat doc ock, but can he pay the bills? he can impress all the ladies, but can he actually have it in himself to risk his girl through the vengeance of others? the scenes bleeds the humanity of a super hero through out the film. especially the elevator scene. y would some one wear something so uncomfortable just to save the world. 2 words to spider man: nappy rash. i love heroes. if there is one main theme in my life, it would be heroes. i just cant get enough of them. every time i have a hero story, i try to emulate the said hero. and every time i fail. my humanity bleeds. maybe i wasnt meant to be a hero. my first post. dont read. its useless. just spreading my wings

      I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time.  To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating.  I love to be alone.  I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.  We are for the most part more lonely when we go abroad among men than when we stay in our chambers.  A man thinking or working is always alone, let him be where he will.  Solitude is not measured by the miles of space that intervene between a man and his fellows.       - Henry D. Thoreau (1817-1862), Walden (1854)

      that was what kim said. this is a country with out a soul. there is no love of self. the filipino dream is to be a little brown american. the hottest college and even post-post-grad course here is nursing. so that they could ship out of this god forsaken country to wipe the white mans ass. after all, we've been that for years. was reading tthe papers today. business are closing down. instead of opting to be manufacturers and producers, we opt to become importers and buyers. we spend so much and earn so little. our swine industry is shutting down. prices on pork will rise, people will losed jobs and the country will lose millions in the market. why should filipino's care? we rather watch marina and dugong every night anyway. our perspective of beauty is that of the mestiza, the chinita, the half something from somewhere else. and to think these people are the very same rejects of their other halfed origins. we idolize everything that is not us. and what of the hope of the nation? the youth? they are to busy getting out the country, getting laid and having fun. and the money of the country? always with the rich. circulated and recirculated amongst the rich. who cares if the poor and weak die as long as they get their ferraris and private islands. the culture is shot. what culture? the youth look up to the demi gods of media machinery. the false lords of hope. where is the blood spilt for father and country? where is the song of the morning? where is the pride of a country raped and rampaged by the passages of time and men? where is the tongue borne by the children of our ancestors and rejected by the successors? where is our hope? where is our soul?... if you cant find one... make one, i'd like to say... the question is HOW.

      tonight i broke down. i just finished diner. i was talking with my mother. she left me at the table to wash my plates. i was alone looking down on the sink washing my plates. i washed them in tears. i stood there just shaking and pressing my hands on the sink. i was crying and i couldnt stop and i didnt know why. i heard my mother come in. i felt her hand on my back. and i felt like a little child again.  The deparment of pediatrics at the nmmc is terrible. they wouldnt care if the clerk died as long as they got their way with the labs, the procedures and the reporting. there are roaches in the ward. they come out at night and crawl out and about on the furniture, on the food and on the patients themselves. one of them managed to crawl up my leg while i was inserting an intravenous line. dextrose in laymans terms. i was pumping the heart of a little boy the other day. it gave up on him. i was his heart. and even i was losing hope. there is no light here. no hope. only pain. and death in the end. The other day we were having our endorsements. the newest resident was receiving a chewing out from the consultant. the resident was on the verge of tears and when she was asked to proceed with her report, the same consultant just whipped her head around to another consultant and chatted in full volume adding much insult to the ludicrous injury already given. worthy to mention is that same well respected consultant is taking up nursing to get out of this country. there are patients here, but there no medicines. there are medicines but there is no money. philippine health care goes not to the needy but to those who can afford. and that is made ever more evident in a run down roach infested government hospital like the NMMC. and i turn off the faucet as i was my plate with tears.

      i wouldnt know. :) hehehe. its called the "suffering messiah complex" by some psychiatrists. Most of history's great people have in some way gone through it. jose rizal, mahatma gandhi, karl marx.... the list goes on. they say people with the same complex claim they have the key to the salvation of man kind. and so goes the claim of most of our politicians... but i wouldnt know. the only keys i have are the keys to the house, and i lost that a while ago. i wanna go home.... wahhhh

      do you know what its like? to live life not the way you want to, but the way you have to? to forsake your happiness for the sake of another's? to have the power to rip off a person's head and break their bones, but you stay your hand and accept all the shit that comes from them? to shake cold, alone and scared that you wouldn't know how to live your life the way you wanted, because the life you live has always been the life you have been given? to have the dreams of making lives of other people better but not having the means for it? to have love, friendship and companionship offered and beared in front of you and to shun it, just to give yours to those who have none? to not want to wake up every morning, but you do because you should, or people would die? to bear all the shit in this life, and still have the time to sing and smile? to hold so much darkness inside of you, and squeeze out all the little drops of life just so you wont lose your sanity and hope? to have those very same embers of hope slowly consume you in a inferno of fervor to fight some more? to save lives, at the sake of your own?

      i walked all the way home from the gate of our subdivision and felt happy. felt happy because i am happy. Not because of some one or something, but because i am. i am inherently happy because on nights like these i feel my soul open up and bear itself with all its beauty and madness. I wish people could see it or feel it. All the positive energy with in me, not marred by my insecurities or fears, my imperfections and frustrations, my darkness and my doom. it is just me. and all the light within me. all the beauty i contain. and i dont mean physical beauty. if you could only see it, you would not wonder what makes me a happy person, and it is not because of my tangible assets that i deem it so. it is deeper, more crucial than that. experience has taught me that my inner beauty can be exploited. some people drink up what they can not have. withdrawal symptoms have been... unpleasant.

      i met jeffrey today. he smiled at me and keep on playing peek a boo with me as if i wouldnt notice him glance my way. Just to piss him off and to tell him i mind, I caught him in midstare and let him off scampering. People like Jeffrey make my day. They make all the pains worth it. Its like i could bear even more, when i should have given up up way before. and i guess jeffrey feels the same way. his kidneys are shot dead. he's pleasantly plump 7 year old smiling face belies the fact that he might not see his 1st decade. and here you see him running around and sticking out his tongue at you just because he can. how sad. i would want to tell you, but i would not know how it would end. but endings for cases like these are always unpleasant. people like him make worth living. if he knew i wonder how he would take it. if he knew, i wonder if he would still be happy. but i thank jeffrey. for giving me hope. when i have none. ignorance is bliss, i wish i didnt know, so i would be happy. but i do. such is the price of knowledge. if ignorance is bliss, doctors must be the most unhappy people of the world

      there i was absent minded as usual. my thoughts drifting from my recent break up to the fact that my medicine residents wont want to let me graduate, to the fact that i still havent paid my parking ticket, to the fact that by the end of this month i would be fat and flabby again, to the fact that i locked my keys inside the car again, to the fact that i am utterly miserable just because i could be, to the fact that i am not living my life the way i want it to be, to the... then he said: " i wish i was like you." I looked up from the chart and saw yellow eyes. why me? "You are healthy, and that beats lying in bed all day" I focused back on the chart. The kid was only 16. He's dying. and all i could think of was myself and not wanting to be myself. And here he was wishing he was me. i told him i would pray for him. i didnt have to tell him that i wrote in the chart the number of days he had left to live. i am becoming cold.
