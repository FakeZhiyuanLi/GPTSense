          I was listening to airamerica radio the other day and something I heard made me wonder if people actually think about anything anymore.  I was listening the Al Franken, not my favorite, but hey, I was driving.    Anyway, he was talking to a Republican in Texas and she was upset that Al "wouldn't stand beside the President in a time of war" and that, by publicly disagreeing with the war in Iraq, he wasn't supporting the troops.   I guess it all comes down to defining Patriotism. Anti-War protesters and others who question the Bush Administrations actions have been labeled unpatriotic, and there arguments dismissed.  I would have to whole-heartedly disagree with this notion that Patriotism means total support for Governmental actions.  In fact Patriotism, too me, is defined by ones love of ones country, not ones government.  As a patriotic American, I believe that it is the Citizens Responsibility to question, to investigate, and to support OR not support the actions that the US government takes on our behalf.  To NOT be critical, that is, to not pay attention and blindly accept governmental actions without thinking about them, I believe, is a dereliction of your responsibility as a part of this democracy (such as it is).  That is being Unpatriotic.     Now, if you look at the situation in Iraq, and find that the Ends are good and the Means are acceptable, then good for you.  I disagree, and will continually disagree privately and publicly in any way I can, and I respect and would fight for your right to do likewise.     If you, instead, allow yourself to be spoonfed your information, and fail to examine the situation FOR YOURSELF, then I don't believe you have a leg to stand on.  You've become little more then a sheep, and Sheep do not a Democracy Make.    Which takes us back to Al Franken and the angry Republican.  To stand beside a Government that takes actions that you disagree with, to Not voice opposition, to Not express your own views and demand that these views be heard, That, my friends, is Unethical, Un democratic, and (Dare I Say) unAmerican.  Once again, IT is our RESPONSIBILITY to keep tabs on our government and to hold them accountable for actions we do not approve of.  See the Declaration of Independence.    As for supporting the troops, I think that we as a country learned a lot during the Vietnam conflict.  One of the many lessons learned in the subsequent decades is the ability to disconnect the soldier from the war, that is, Support the troops while not supporting the war.  I think anyone who chooses to stand in this countries defense deserves our utmost respect and our plentiful thanks.  They make us safer, and they make the world safer.   This is how I feel.  My father was in the Navy during the late sixties and the closest he got to Vietnam was Greece.  That didn't stop people from spitting on him when he came home and was in uniform.  That was a horrible experience, and I'm sure that there are many stories (thousands no doubt) similar.      In my opinion, we should support our troops by caring out a foreign policy which involves the international community and places American soldiers in Harms way only as a last resort.  The Bush Foreign Policy (first strike doctrine, the alienation of the UN and our Allies, faulty intelligence as a trigger for a faulty war) does not coincide with this belief.  It is a policy of beligerancce that puts American (and the few remaining Allies) soldiers at risk unnecessarily.  So in essence, I believe that to support the troops is to oppose the war and how it is being conducted.

      Alright, As the title indicates, this blog is about the West.  The West, naturally, has many different definitions, some geographic, some ideological.     I hope to discuss writers of the American west, something that, as a Pacific Northwesterner i am particularly interested in.  I'm interested in Regionalism as it pertains to book publishing, and how many authors, such as Wallace Stegner, etc, fail to break out Nationally due to be labeled a "Western writer".   In addition, and at a greater scale, I want to use the idea of "The Western World" (Derived from Greek and Roman and Christian traditions) as a springboard into examining American involvement worldwide, and how we as a country interact with those of different cultures and with different values.   This is pretty vague, I know.  And intentionally broad.  More then anything, I just want to rant and rave and vent some frustrations that I've been feeling as a Westerner (in both regards).
