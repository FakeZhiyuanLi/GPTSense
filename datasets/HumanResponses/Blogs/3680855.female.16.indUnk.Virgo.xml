      I'm going to the Fifth Season tonight for 2 Locust's birthdays. If I wasn't the size of a barn (which I really don't care) I might be able to find something nice to wear. Since I can't I'll wear the old stand bys, black capris and some kind of shirt. It's gotten to the point that it doesn't seem that even if I were to starve myself I wouldn't lose any weight, so why should I not have ice cream every so often or a candy bar. My new motto is going to be" eat dessert first and if you're still hungry eat more dessert!!" I think that I can actually live by that. Who's with me??

      I was going to name this blog "Can you top this" but knowing how pathetic my day will be I figured even Grandma Cooper could top it. Here are the highlights... High 79, low humidity and dew point, not a cloud in the sky.  Now for my fun.... No car, no cell phone, just laundry scraping the paint off the house getting ready to paint, and talking to Bones. ( Who would rather be chasing birds or rabbits then listening to me!) Now, I ask you, can it get any better?

      Let me explain that I did not go out looking for a phone number for Erin, it just happened. After being out with the Locust and once again Kim pullimg out the pictures of her kids (not for the first or second time) I had finally gotten tired of these people saying how pretty they were when I clearly had the most beautiful girls. So I finally pulled my pictures out, this guy, he's 21, wrote down his name & number for me to give to Erin. Totally innocent.  Today we had a great day with Gary & Cory. I picked them up ay 10 we went to Toys R Us to let Cory pick out his birthday present. We came home did the trampoline, the sand box, more trampoline, a silly string fight, more trampoline. Did I mention lunch at Burger King and dinner at Gary's favorite place, Das Dutch Haus. We took them back at 7. Cory has taken to repeating EVERY word Gar says, that's a fun time. They went  swimming at Char's yesterday and Cory in burnt pretty bad. F.A. said "we put sunscreen on him and nobody else burned." Well nobody else is a redhead, so you need to use sunblock more often. SLOVAKS!!

      I'm sure Erin will fill you in on her night, which I'm SURE you will find entertaining. I'm just going to give you the highlights from this end. Erin is housesitting and watching her bosses cat & dog (aka The Rat) Sun & Mon. So I'm thinking an early night, Katey was only going for ice cream with Joel (a friend & her bosses son) Karl and I decide we wanted ice cream too and went to Handels in Boardman which happened to be where Katey was. So we drove to the Columbiana one which was closed. We ended up with Dairy Queen (not the same.) At 11:10 PM Katey calls to say they're on thier way home they just left Friendly's, they went there for ice cream AFTER Handels. So I went to bed before midnight. (Sat night Erin & I stayed up and watch something on the food channel until 3AM) At 1:33 AM our phone rang & scared the crap out of me since I was in a dead sleep as was Karl who for some reason had to check caller id before answering. The rat wouldn't stop howling & shit  in the house. Karl being the Dad he is got dressed and went over, he got back home at 2:45. I dozed on & off till he got home. Fell back into a dead sleep around 3:15 or so. At 5:55 the phone rings again, and of course the checking caller id is a must, Erin needs the door unlocked because she's in our garage and doesn't have the dead blot key. After that I really never got any sleep. People think that when they have babies the never get any sleep, just let them see what it's like as thier kids get older and so do they. Your body does NOT adjust to no sleep as easy. So needless to say I am totally worthless today which is why I'm at the computer and not cleaning my house.  NOW MY SECOND TOPIC.....Now not only do I have no car I have also been de-cell phoned. Katey & Karl share a phone since she's in school all day and he only uses it for work. We see no reason to pay for a 4th phone bill right now. Well, Katey now wants her phone 24/7 so she asked me to give mine to Karl to use instead of hers. Which means not only can I not go anywhere I can't even use my cell phone!

      As I was remembering my dad this morning it struck me how true it is that you usually marry somebody like your own father and I have. Just like my dad, Karl has ALWAYS treated me like gold, (there are days I think he might be a saint)  he loves his kids more than people can believe, he gets all choked up when they do ANYTHING, and is so proud of them that he tells anybody who will listen how beautiful and smart they are. Even now as he gets older ( him mind you not me!) he has taken to laying on the bed when he gets home and flipping through the channels! Amazing how alike they are and how much I love them both! ....So when I sit down this morning to put on the MUCH needed make up I was missing my mirror and my eyeliner. I went and found the mirror on Erin's floor, A MIRACLE, but the eyeliner was not to be found. It was in her purse. Now, it's not the first time I couldn't find my things and it's not always Erin having them Katey too is guilty of this. I don't care if they use my stuff but can't they return it so I don't have to go on safari to find it!!!

      Since I really don't have as an exciting life as my mother or daughter I decided I would just give you some of the random thoughts bumping around in my head.  Like....why do some people have not only all the luck but the money to go with it      ....why them not us         ....why do some people work harder then every one else and never get ahead         ....why can't I hit the lottery         ....why does it seems that I get so much stupider the older my children get         ....why am I suppose to know where everything is and if it can't be found I must have lost it         ....why can't I find my wedding band         ....why are my dog and my families dogs so much smarter and cuter then everybody elses         ...why did the oldest girl and oldest boy in my family get all of the cooking talent and my kids end up with grilled chicken and baked potatoes every night          These are just some things that I thought I would share, and since my mom & Dawn got the creative genes and I got zippo it may take me a while to come up with something to compete with the word of the day.
