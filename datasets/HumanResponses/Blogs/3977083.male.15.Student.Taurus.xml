         I kinda liked this quote and it might be of some use to other people.       "PROMISE YOURSELF ...   to be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind.  To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet.  To make all your friends feel that there is something in them.  To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true.  To think only of the best, and to expect only the best.  To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as your are about your own.  To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to greater achievements of the future.  To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile.  To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have not time to criticize others.  To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, and too happy for permit the presence of trouble."                                                        - Christian Larson     I know it sounds somewhat cheesy, but it does have some good points.  Hehe, in other words "Have a good day,"   ^_^   .

         Well, today, I managed to use the mousse my mother bought me, and to bring out my natural curls. People wanted to know if I had gotten a perm. I said "Heavens, no! These&nbsp;are my natural curls!" In not so many words. They said that it was cute though. We weren't late today, but just on time. We even managed to acquire a cushioned pew. I was very pleased. When we got home, I finally remembered to email my Easter talk to Sister Pheysey. She's been begging me for months. I really am not sure of why my talk impressed so many people so much. They're still complimenting me about it. Oh well, Mine is not to wonder why, mine is but to do and die. After a few events that I admit I may have overreacted in, I am now forced to think of and participate in an activity with  urlLink  Almond  . I think I may be able to avoid it, but if not, oh well, it can't be too bad. I practiced for nearly an hour. A lot of it was improv, but hey. There are some times when you CAN serve two masters. My mother and myself. Well, in the background, I can hear my mother hinting about how much she dislikes my situation, and how she wishes I was like any other child.  urlLink  *sigh*   Life is just a package stuffed with foam peanuts. You have to sift through the annoying to find the enjoyable, and sometimes you just have to make do with the bubblewrap at the bottom. I read some from Fellowship of the Ring. I wish I could read faster. I really need to buckle down and just read the thing. Oh, I got emails today. Yesterday I just decided to tell    urlLink   Van Tan      the truth that I don't like him, and never have, but that I really don't want to lose such a good friend. He wrote back saying that he actually hadn't been avoiding me, just that he'd been busy. I just decided to believe him. He also assured me that we were still friends, which made me glad.     Anyway, 2 of the other emails were from    urlLink   The Radish     , telling me about his&nbsp;family reunion&nbsp;in CA, as well as congratulating me about telling Van Tan the truth. The last email was from  urlLink  The Watermelon  ; it was&nbsp;about my confession as well. She also wanted to know exactly what the truth was. I told her that the truth was that I never liked him, and that I'm a dork. Well, that pretty much covers my day.

       Hiya! I think that it'd be safe now to try to decide what kind of stuff we'll talk about, and exactly what we'll be doin.&nbsp;Should we decide just how many people contributing to the posts we'll allow? Because anyone,&nbsp;whether they're a team member or not, can comment to the posts, but I think it might be a good idea to limit the # of people able to post. Just a vague limit though, not like "only 15" or something. Also, I've noticed that no one has posted as of yet, only commented. So, if this is a matter of not knowing how, or something, I can answer most questions you have, and those can either be written to me, or put here as a comment, or whatever you wanna do. Also, the subjects of discussion...we need to decide whether we'll just be talking about our days, or if we'll have open discussion about current events, opinions on music, movies, whatever. I think it'd also be fun, later on, to have like an election thing to decide who should be "president" or something, so we can have some organization...blah blah blah. Anywho...yeah. Comment, please :D

       Nice quotes you guys...... I thought I'd throw in some I've come across:  "I think there's a difference between appearance and image. An image is not how you look. It's what you do. It's what you portray. Your personality, the example you set, and that's huge for me."  "The greatest glory never comes from falling, but from rising each time you fall."    "It's important that I make a difference in some way. It's not necessarily how I make a difference, but I want to make sure that I do."   "...as long as you're living right, then you don't have  to worry about what people see."  "Half my butt is mac & cheese and the other half is Krispy Kreme..."  Hehehehehehe, I bet you'll NEVER guess who said all that.....

         Haha, just kidding. Anyway, I just thought I'd check in, and tell ya'all...something. I was just reading, and I came across a couple quotes that I liked. So, I thought I'd follow Sir Radish's grand example, and post them. Well, here they are:           I would rather be in company with a dead man than an absent one. For, if the dead man gives me no pleasure, at least he shows me no contempt, whereas the absent man, silently indeed, but very plainly, tell me that he does not think me worth his attention.   - Lord Chesterfield           We should ever conduct ourselves towards our enemy as if he were one day to be our friend.                                                                                                           -John Henry   Newman            Help thy brother's boat across, and lo! Thine own boat has reached the shore.   -Hindu Proverb            I have no right, by anything I do or say, to demean a human being in his own eyes. What matters is not hwat I think of him, it is what he thinks of himself. To undermine a man's self esteem is a sin.   -Antoine de Saint-Exupery            A ship in the harbor is safe, but that's not what ships were built for.   -John A. Shield            If you chase two rabbits, both will escape.   -Unknown            I know no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor.   -Henry David Thoreau            Come, my friends, 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.   -Alfred Lord Tennyson           Well, I hope I didn't bore you too much. Remember, it was your choice, not mine to read them, if you did lol. Well, cya'all later!
