      Well howdy doody.  I have just had a delicious spaghetti bolognaise sauce, made my Mark. He's my semi/quasi/stepdad. Well, stepdad. But first things first.  Yesterday, today, and tomorrow (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday for those of you too tired or drunk to figure out the current day) have been/will be my Induction days at Kings. This involves a mixture of a variety of talks on different aspects of the school, 'taster sessions' of my options - an outline of the syllabus and example material - and tomorrow, a BBQ! Will probably be disappointing, as most such things are, but hopefully the food will be good. However, the major positive aspect of this is that it is my first taster of school life with my friends (including Julia). I could explain the friends thing (and I do have friends at my old school, several of whom are also going to Kings) but it is complicated and I don't even know who you are. You could my mother, nosing through the history. Hello Mum! Thanks for the Vitamin B!  But I digress.  I will now get to see Julia (and my friends) every day! This is a very positive (and slightly strange, but in a good way) thing. Also, she lives just round the corner from the school, so I can go back to hers after a school for a nice hot cup of tea (and if you think that's just an innuendo, you don't know either of us).  However, Kings is also a very good school in its own respects. The quality of the teaching seems much better, and the teachers much friendlier - though coming into it as a Sixth Former, where you are treated with more respect and intelligence than a Year 7, may help. The pupils in general are also much friendlier. At Jack Hunt, there were quite a few nice (terrible word, must cut down) people. However, there were just as many complete and utter...um...nasty people. There seem to be very few at Kings, meaning I can act my confident and friendly self, as opposed to the shy and intimidated self (who is coming out less and less these days. Anyway, so my peers are more...congenial.  The buildings are very different. I suppose it's about the same size, in terms of floor space, as Jack Hunt, but is a very different layout - two stories, for one thing. The buildings are much older and far more archaic - twists, turns, and knobbly bits all over the place. I am finding my way about surprisingly easily though. Like chewing a brick.  Also, in two days it is the end of Year 11 prom (for Jack Hunt). It should be quite good.  However, far more importantly, and to which I am looking forward to far more, is the youth hostelling trip, which I believe I have already mentioned. Julia is coming over on Thursday to help me pack - in my new hiking bag! I went with my Dad after school today to buy it - 65 litres. A tad bigger than I'd have liked, but the next size down was too small. Ho hum.  Dooby dooby doo....aah yes. I had Kung Fu this evening, which was exhausting, to say the least. The most intensive workout so far - I had to stop near the end and sit down in the fresh air because I did feel like I was about the throw up. Great stuff though - and I learnt an elbow strike, how to spar, and how to push someone to the floor easily. School tomorrow should be fun....  Anyway. I've been typing too long, my spine's hurting (I'm sitting cross-legged on the floor in my bedroom on the laptop) and I need an early night, to catch up.   So I bid you all a very fond farewell. Unless you're one of my enemies. You guys suck.

      www.pgdp.net Distributed Proofreaders. An excellent internet project, which you will either find fascinating and addictive, or dull and repetitive. There's only one way to find out - sign up and try it! It will help improve your grammar, as well.  I am at my father's now - Maxey Hall. Sounds grand, I think you'll agree. It is, contrary to the name, just a farmhouse, not especially big. It does, however, have quite a big garden...and a couple of fields (but I think one is actually a paddock. I don't know what the difference is, but I am too scared to find out.)  As I may have mentioned in my last post, Daniel stayed round last night (stayed, not slept...he was up the whole night watching baseball). I, of course, got a good night's sleep in my bed upstairs. I just managed to catch Julia before she left for choir, and she came round a couple of hours later. We watched Men in Black II, and Alex came round a bit as well. I got into some trouble, due to the irresistibleness (I know, dear) of Julia, but hey ho.  And I need to go now, to help my Dad move something, possibly house. Ha ha, I kid. Ahem. Wish me luck!

      Again, I am neglecting. Please make me update.  I have just returned with Daniel from Poppy's - an end of exam leaving film thing.  Oh yes - exams have finished. Last one this morning (Sociology). Huzzah. It also means an end to my time at Jack Hunt - a transition fully completed by Induction Week at Kings, starting on Monday. I am looking forward to it.  Anyway. Poppy's. It was fun - we watched Seven and part of The Shining. I played the piano and table football, both terribly. Shocking, considering my absitence from the cider. I was, however, missing someone terribly.  I have decided on a plan to get into Oxford (you can't apply for Oxford and Cambridge in the same year, I have decided against Cambridge). I wish to study Mathematics, or a degree incorporating Mathematics, like Mathematics and Philosophy. However, bearing in mind how difficult it is to get a place, I have a plan - write a groundbreaking paper on some area of mathematics, thus showing my aptitude in an original manner. Swish.

      It's me again. Sorry for the lack of posting the last couple of days, but I have been quite preoccupied.  On Saturday, I went to Sarah's. To be more precise: Nick came round in the morning. We caught the bus - it was 12 minutes late. On the bus already was Julia, Daniel, Alex, Haggis and Andrena. We rode the bus to Oundle and met Sarah there. I broke the umbrella. I lost the spring. Due to me staying behind to look for the spring, and Julia staying behind because I was, we arrived at Sarah's house later than the rest. On arrival, we discovered Daniel had lost the other spring. We had tea. A roof was climbed. We watched the Aristocats. We went to the field. Umm...ah! I opened up a can of whup-ass. We went to the hall. Oh, it was Sarah's Mum's 40th. There was a buffet. And dancing. I danced with some random girl. Lucky Julia wasn't there, else she would have been jealous. We returned to the tent at about half 1. ...tents are fun. Woke up after a brief amount of sleep. Julia left early. I stayed with Sarah, Nick, HAggis and Steg for a while. Tartan universes are fun also. I drank some tea. Got home. Went for supper with my family. Went to sleep. Woke up. Went to my Graphics exam. Came home. Sorted through photos. Went to my Business Studies exam. Came home. Rang McDonald's in Bretton. Went to Julia's. Revised Physics (alpha to omega). Hem hem. Came home. Had cake. Watched the Mighty Boosh. Slept. Woke up. Drank tea. Had a bath. Looked at some photos. Drank tea. Rang Julia. Drank tea. Revised Sociology. Started typing this. Finished typing this.

      I have just returned from walking Julia home (through the crime ridden streets of Peterborough, no less). We attended the Petrus concert at the church - a wonderful performance. The first half was Dmitri's Piano Trio No.3, followed by an interval (free drinks!) and then the End of Time thing - a musical representation of part of the Book of Revelations. Both were stunning performances - very moving. I walked Julia home, returned home, made myself tea, and Mum and Mark came back soon after - with a Doner Kebab! My first ever. It's delicious. I can't believe I've never tried it before. Very nice.

      Credit for the random title goes to Julia.  Another day, another tuxedo measured. I went into town with Mark (my stepdad) earlier, to order it and get the measurements done. It's for my school prom, end of year 11 type thing. Since only Jack Hunt people are allowed to go, I am going alone...but I do, despite what some may believe, have friends at Jack Hunt, so a good time should still be had. It is on the 1st of July. I will, however, need to get an early night, as I believe we are catching the train at some ungodly hour of the morning of the second, to somewhere in the Lake District. I, with 7 of my friends, am going 'youth hostelling' for a week in the Lake District - just us, no parents or the like. It should be a lot of fun (and walking). I need money for food though...ah well, I'll eat Nick. I'm not really sure what a youth hostel is like, having never been. I want to take a baseball bat, just in case, but I doubt I'll be allowed. But I digress. When I have finished this post, I am going to have a bath (Probably bathtime reading - A Field Guide to Demons and Devils) and after a spot of lunch, I am setting off for my beloathed school for my RE exam - two hours of CofE fun! And after that, a quick jab at the doctor's, some supper, and then settling down on church pews for an hour and a half of Olivier Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time - my mother is the secretary of Petrus (an organisation that sets up classical concerts in Peterborough), and I quite like classical music, so I'm going. It is apparently quite heavy going...but good company can make all things a pleasure.

      Sorry for yet another post, but I forgot to mention it in the other 3... I love Julia (astrojaxx).

      So, the state of the world, as based on my (very) limited knowledge:  - There are countries - These countries have people and leaders - Some of these leaders are not very nice people - Some leaders don't get along - Some leaders lie to their people and kill lots of other people - Some leaders lie to their people about doing the above - There is an idiot and a sheep. The idiot wants to get rid of all the bad things in the world. Except the bad things which he likes. Or which he can't get rid of. Or which he can't remember the names of. He likes short, one word countries...anything like 'North Korea' is far too difficult. - The idiot attacked a country to get rid of a nasty man who was killing a lot people. He killed a lot of people. The nasty man is gone, but lots of people are still being killed. Presumably, he anticipated this. - A lot of people with a lot of guns are fighting over a small piece of land. Both of them need it, but neither can share. I think some sort of fence is being made.   As you can see, I'm not really much into current affairs. I like to look at the 'Big Picture'. History tends to repeat itself, anyway. For example, the USA is the new Roman Empire - luxury, decadence, total military power, corruption - it has the lot. Therefore, it will soon crumble inwards, leaving a power vacuum which will mean a lot more fighting happens. Book your seats now, to the upcoming Struggle for Power!!! The front row is already taken by the Apocalypse Gang, so be sure to book now, before the other good seats are taken! Free nuclear warhead for the first 50 bookings! Popcorn available in the foyer!  However, I don't tend to think much about these type of things, and instead occupy myself with more important and relevant questions...like a use for 2^2^C outside of the number of subsets of 2^C, and what the hell 4/4 timing is.

      Oh, and as I forgot to mention in my previous post, I live in Peterborough, which is somewhere in the middleish-eastish of England. I have also just left Year 11 - the last compulsory year of education! Huzzah! I am, perhaps foolishly, carrying on though - at a different school, however. It's a sweltering hot June, and we all know what that means! Exam time! I'm nearing the end of my GCSEs (General Certificate of Secondary Educations). Some have been tough - notably French and Business Studies - and some have been a piece of qualified pie - such as Maths and (I hope) English. Today was my first Business Studies exam in the morning, and my second and last Maths in the afternoon. Business Studies was more difficult than I had anticipated - I doubt I'll see an A* there now. And apparently the toughest of the two exams is still to come.  Afterwards, I strolled up to the Fish and Chip shop with Mr Bullimore, to purchase some mid-exam sustenance. Finding it closed, we pulled ourselves together and went back to his house, where we discussed our film project some more, before walking back to the school, stopping off at the (now open) Chip shop and buying a chip butty. We discovered the fiendishly sharp edges of fried chips, adding more weight to my theory of a Universal Crime Syndiate of Friers (Not the fat guys in robes...those are Friars). After resting in the Library and mocking Key Stage 3 practise papers, we went to the Sports Hall to factorise, functionise and...um...fart. Maths was, as expected, as easy as a very easy thing on an especially relaxed day. I completed it too soon though, leaving me with about an hour of sitting around...during which I memorised Pi to 11 digits (3.14159265359) and generally pondered. I am now home, listening to the chatter of the birds and some random song WinAmp has skipped onto. It's tripe though, so let me just skip on...ahah! The discordant symphonics of Eminem. He seems to have a stutter. Poor man. And on that note, I'm leaving.

      Ahem.  I am at Julia's, and have just finished a cup of tea. And some chocolate digestives.   Type your body here.  In a few minutes, we are going to Tesco Metro to buy food and miscellaneous items for youth hostelling. We are meeting tomorrow at about half 8 at the train station, for any aspiring stalkers out there.  Tonight is the Jack Hunt prom, as I believe I have mentioned. To be honest, I am not really looking forward to it, for various reasons...  Anyway, we are off to read about the fascinating world of vitamins on www.everything2.com.  Have fun, y'all.
