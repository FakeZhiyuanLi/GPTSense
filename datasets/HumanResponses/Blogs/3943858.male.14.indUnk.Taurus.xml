      Just got back from MK........... had a really good time.......... went to the music shop and tried loads of different guitars   We also went to evesham....... and the emedia series wont work so we're just getting a normal computer....... top end though :)   Finally I'm bothered to set up webspace and get pics on my blog..... so here's my lovely 3 guitars.... 2 amps and fuzz factory        Nice eh?   Jim went to york-o and we will soon be following him..... That's all that really happened...... oh yes..... word of advice : never lick batteries....   I also stepped on a fag lighter.... ( not a good idea)   Here's this really cool guitar i tried out (what makes it even cooler is that daron of SOAD has it as his signature guitar)...... i want one but with a £1,500 price tag i dont think i'll be getting one right now :(&nbsp;         That's all

      I've been sitting at this computer since 2 this afternoon.....   Not much happened, chorgs is following it up.... his face is really screwed and the police took pics etc  I managed to get stairway to heaven perfect :)   Steph baked him some cakes and took them round which was very nice...   My wrist is really fucked....... i have to wear a support that looks like a sweatband...... eurgh how townieish   I dropped my Fuzz Factory and it now sounds really cool :)  And i also modded my guitar (here is the Fuzz Factory as used by Muse's Matt Bellamy)       Not much else happened...... my posting will wind down for the summer as i can't be arsed to post that often   Bye

      YAY it's finally the end of year 8........... We didn't get let out early but hey......  Usual end of term stuff......quizes etc.... and i'm in maths set 2 with all my mates so that'll be ok..... and we're guarenteed not to get physco hancock :)  I still have 8 outstanding textbooks that i should have given in....... and one 30 minute detention........(lets hop she forgets)  We were all at the bus stop........me, jims, bernd, chorgins and toby dave etc...... the bus was already late.... at about 4:10 two men..... one asian and a black man (about 18)&nbsp;were walking towards us...."Get outta our way" they shouted..... before we had a chance to move they shouldered bernd and jim....&nbsp; they carried on walking through us hurling abuse..... chorgins was standing right&nbsp;in front of them..... they grabbed him by the neck and pushed him..... he said " what do you think you're doing!" they both held him and the black one punched him pretty hard right in the middle of his face...... they walked off laughing...... by this time charlie was really heavily&nbsp;bleeding..... his whole shirt was covered in blood and so were his hands and the pavement..... he&nbsp;helplessly&nbsp;shouted back at them but&nbsp;they were gone by then........ no one did anything because we&nbsp;were so shocked...  Lucky Jim had some pills that stop bleeding..... and the bleeding stopped......&nbsp;two other men came up and asked what had happened... they suggested&nbsp;we should have overpowered them.......i found this a but ridiculous...... what if they had a knife?  It could have been any of us but unfortunately&nbsp;it was charlie..... his nose&nbsp;looks pretty bad and i think his&nbsp;glasses are smashed.....  I'll probably have to give a statement or something..... as will everyone else.... I just hope nothing like this ever happens again...... I'm&nbsp;amazed how ignorant and utterly&nbsp;stupid some people&nbsp;can&nbsp;be....&nbsp;  Oh well......... i'll try to&nbsp;foget about it for now and get on and enjoy the holiday... I'm looking forward to year 9 and&nbsp;I hope that nothing&nbsp;like that will ever happen to me or any of my friends.....  I also had my 2nd guitar lesson tonight........ £10 for 1 hour :)  I did some fingerstyle stuff&nbsp;... led zeppelin and&nbsp;beatles.... We're getting the new comp soon and&nbsp;maybe going to yorkshire to see our friends (they have a really cool house) it'd be even better if we could clash with&nbsp;jim.......man that'd&nbsp;be good......  Sorry for the length of this post but i jsut felt like getting it off my chest...... Bye for now &nbsp;

      One more day until our six weeks of holiday..........We've convinced our unbelivably stupid DT teacher (Ms Giddings) to let us out early......by about an hour   We also played rugby near the maths block.......Hence the massive cut on will sendell's face :)  I am amazingly bored and i've been reduced to eating 'Schnitten mit Haselnusscreme' and some minty gooey stuff...   Parrott (this fat 'guitarist' who gets on our bus) got a large chunk bitten out of his guitar by his equally stupid dog....the fact that it is a mahogany telecaster makes it even more pleasurable.....  &nbsp;  I'll sit here until about 6pm waiting as my breath gets fresher and fresher...... then at 7ish some guy''s coming to check out the old piano.......i'll be sad to see it leave......and even sadder to see the massive chunk of flooring it removed when we moved it...... :(  &nbsp;  I look forward to tommorow....... the bugger all attitude everyone has....... we can do what the hell we like and they cant do anything about it :)....... It'll be fun trying to drive Mr Mcintosh completedly insane........he's this monotonous physics teacher who doesn't care what you are doing unless you are directly ahead of him......maybe there's something wrong with his neck.....who knows?   Here's to the holidays !!!! 6 weeks of fun......only to get back to school to find out that you have even shittyer teachers than last year and to be greeted with aa plethora of tests.....projects and stuff like that...   Bye     Thanks Jim for telling someone about the piano......I get a share of the&nbsp;sale (if any)   I buggered the digital camera yesterday by taping it to my handlebars while doing wheelies, endo's etc but i got some pretty sweet footage...   It's 21 :56 and i've officially fucked my wrist.......I already hurt it playing rugby earlier today........and there i go playing master of puppets at full speed (205BPM) I don't think it's gonna get better for a long time :(

      I was up last night till about 3 this morning and i'm tired....  I was also texting as many people as possible.... no one replied (funny that.. seeing as it was 4 in the morning)  And this huge bug flew through the window and it was flying around for a bit (this was like awesomely huge) and then Dan (a mate) hit it with my NME....so i now have bugs innards on my bed.....   it's now 10:30 and i've just woken up..... that's odd for me   I probably won't do much today....seeing as im restricted to the house... One more day and it's back to school  Then&nbsp;2 more days of that and no school for ? weeks...  I was going&nbsp;to&nbsp;put a pic of my guitars in this&nbsp; post but i dont have a site to upload from&nbsp;so i'm buggered for that  &nbsp; I'll be going now........might&nbsp;do a post this evening  &nbsp;

      I have woken up from 14 straight hours of sleep......and i feel great (and a bit drowsy too)   Not doing much today apart from seeing a mate......maybe&nbsp; i'll go to the cinema  I got NME this morning and spent a few hours reading that......   My dad gave me £5 for taking all the tiles out of the kitchen.... And he also saw my report :(   "Lloyd managed to magnificently under-achieve in the end of term assessment"   Oh well, language and music good as usual....   I also posted my entry to win a 50th anniversery Fender Stratocaster   I'll go for now...... See you tommorow

      For the 4th day running I feel like teh poop :(  I am still a prisoner in my own home......oh well monday and tuesday and it'll all be over \o/ (I've now found out that our next head of year will not be the 6"6 scot but will instead be the extremely hairy Mrs Jiggins :( )  But for now i'll sit here like a lemon playing various Muse riffs through my lovely shiny fuzz factory...  And tommorow i'm gonna go look at new computers :)  Hopefully we're getting an evesham emedia thingy.....all very flash. And it networks to your TV aswell. Can't wait for the holidays.........going to Germany and seeing friends in their 'mansion' in Yorkshire.....  Hopefully our band will meet a&nbsp;few times aswell . (If i can fix my guitar in time)  Ill do a post tommorow......but I'm now going to sleep until about 6ish
