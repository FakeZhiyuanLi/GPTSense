      In 1984 I was a high school senior with a need for a summer job. My Dad worked for the county in EMS administration, and advised me to take an EMT class.I would make more money(ha) than my buds and it was better than working at the drive-in(double ha).Now my Dad was involved with EMS most of my life. I would tag along at disaster drills and classes.Dad took the paramedic class in 1983. I helped him study his drug cards, and went to a few classes, I got to meet the guys who were working on the bus .That same year we were going out to dinner, when a call came in for an explosion at a house fire.There were firefighters missing, the buildings were knocked flat, Two firetrucks were crushed, it was heavy. I spent the night in a Gold Cross ambulance, hanging out with the crew, and watching the whole thing unfold. I don't remember how long we were there when the found the guys together under the wall. I do remember the looks on the faces of everyone there. That night I slept hard and dreamed some strange dreams.You could say, I was groomed to become a paramedic someday. I took the EMT class at a ECC South on Saturdays while I finished high school. I was, by far, the youngest student at 17, and oddly enough I seemed to take to the material quite easily. In hindsight I have met some strange and different people in and around EMS, patients as well as partners, bosses, hospital people, you get the point. I'm going to write about the ones who stand out in my memory.   This class was my first exposure to the dreaded   BLOWNUT   ( Someone who has volunteered at some sort of agency the doesn't require psych profiles prior to exposing the individual to the unsuspecting public at large.) Please bear in mind that most of the folks involved in volunteerism, be it fire, police (really scary), or EMS(really really scary) are involved because their personal sense of community demands a contribution. I truly have nothing but respect and admiration for these folks, it's the other ones that make my skin crawl. The blownut is the guy who has to get up close and see some sort of horrible incident, not to help, not to contribute, but because  they get off on it.   The thing about psych profiles is true, at least where I work it's true, and a good thing too, we'd lose 10% off the top and 30% off the bottom of the workforce.    My first six months around some very different people was, at best, a struggle. Not because I wasn't learning, but because a lot of my peers didn't. I have long been cursed(or blessed) with the inability to suffer fools gladly. The basic EMT cirriculum can't be considered rocket surgery. Essential information about airway,breathing and circulation, some splinting, childbirth and very basic assessment is about it. To say this stuff is spoonfed wouldn't be far from the truth, but there were a bunch of 30 - 50 year old guys who couldn't learn it, but all they talked about was seeing some grisly shit and cutting women's clothes off. I finished the class and recieved my certification, starting work at Lasalle Ambulance in June 1985.  My first couple years shot by, I managed to break just about every policy regarding behavior, attendance, and attitude. My first 2 years I switched between Lasalle and Gold Cross twice each.Not that any of that made an impression on me.I was such an asshole, I can't believe some old medic never left me behind in the depths of the Perry projects(in the late 80's a very scary place). More than a few of these guys jacked me up, until I started to figure out that we had an obligation to the people we were taking care of. I'd like to think that i was suffering from some sort of age related sociopathy,because the more time I worked the more I realized that if I didn't take personal responsibility for my actions, I would be ineffective as a medic.  In 1987 I began paramedic school at Wally's college of EMS knowledge (WNYEMSTI- 1986-2001) and quickly found out that I wasn't nearly as smart as I thought. That year flew by,in a blur of pharmagology,cardiology, endorinology, etc. I was firmly entrenched in the middle of the pack, and finished with paramedic certification in the summer of 1988. Now I was convinced that I had my shit together, unfortunately I was completely unprepared for what was to follow. I spent another couple years working and getting fired some more, at least I was good at somthing, and oddly enough I started to have an instinctive approach to the job. I had always done as much clinical as I could and read like a demon.So I worked and got fired and worked and got fired......in 1991 I had effectively worn out my welcome just about everywhere, and since I was a Dad now, baby gotta eat, I left EMS, I thought for good.

        I  spent the first two years away from ems...away, far,far away. I did a bunch of different things for money, I drove wheelchair vans, cabs, trucks, you name it.That joyous interlude lasted about six months, during which I grew my hair(since that was free, because I was fucking BROKE) and desperately sought a new direction. Dad came through with a part time job at ECMC as a hospital aide, it was either that or morgue attendant. Looking back I really wish I'd taken the morgue job, I love dead people, ther're quiet. It was not meant to be, I don't remember the details exactly, but the county job was good bread, and since I was po' I took it. Now two or three things that happened at ECMC were good. I met my wife there, and we're still married and pretty happy most of the time. We have three cool kids, who I'm sure I'll gush about at some point, but not here.      I learned quickly how a hospital works. The politics involved in getting changes made and their (mostly the nurses, they run the joint don't let anyone tell you different) attitude toward a fallen paramedic who was working as an aide was neither generous or charitable. Fortunately, I'm a decent clinician, I had more patient care experience than half the nurses I worked for.I understood my role and it was up to the individual nurses how much shit got dumped on you. Since the job was part time, that meant weekends, all of them. I was assigned to the float pool and basically either got shat upon, or taken care of. I still knew a bunch of people that understood what I was capable of. These nice girls would send me to psych, or to do one on ones with sucidal patients. One on one is fun for about ten seconds. You sit in a private room with a person who attempted suicide and failed horribly. One guy shot himself in the face, but they saved him anyway. He lost some frontal brain, an eye, most of his teeth, and all of his ability to think rationally. This wasn't awful though, awful was the busy general medicine floors or ortho. In ortho it's tug lug and carry all day long.   Eventually I was offered a full time job.     Aside from poor time and attendance, I was a good aide, so I got a spot on the rehab unit. I met my wife there, that first week and we took to each other pretty quickly. Time passed, I worked, kept growing my hair, and pretty soon we got married. Bad news, though, I now had to leave the unit. I lasted about two months on the other side and I was gone. It was a really shitty job, and I was glad to get out. I had been thinking about nursing school, and the exposure to some of the retards in that place made me realize that I had no future inside a hospital.    Now, you have to realize that my wife has the patience of a saint. That's the only explination for why she didn't run that first year or two. I had managed to work my way into a job in a kitchen. I've always loved to cook, and this was a perfect way to go 180* carrer-wise. I rarely worked anywhere for more than six months. Some less some more, but I learned everywhere I went, and eventually was working in fine dining establishments, but still making shit money.One year I had seven W-2 forms to send in, I think I grossed twelve grand. The work was great, but the atmosphere was not conducive to maintaining any sort of sobriety. I'm pretty sure I smoked enough dope and drank a river of vodka than any human has a right to expect to survive. Not to say that it wasn't fun at times, but for the most part Everybody is fucking nuts,the wait staff is stupid,and the stress level is insane, I felt right at home. I told my Dad that it was just like working the car, except you could eat what you got on your shirt (He loved that, worked into a CISD lecture)    One day i was cleaning out my wallet and I found my paramedic card. It was lapsing soon, and even though I didn't see myself ever going back, I was unwilling to let it go.I asked at work and was able to go to recert class for free, so I went.
