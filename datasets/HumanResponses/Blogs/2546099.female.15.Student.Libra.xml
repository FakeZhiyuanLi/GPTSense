      This is unusual 2 days in a row. Im in a betta mood 2day so i hopefully wont write about the stuff i wrote about yesterday. I saw the final lord of the rings movie on sunday nite. It was fantastic! I neva thought id like lotr but i do. The only part i didnt like was the last half an hour or wateva it was, it was kinda boring but i was told that it was a very shortened version so i guess thats gd. Im going 2 c itagain wit mez this sunday nite so if ne1 wants 2 come, who reads my blogs u r very welcome. I guess i could go in2 detail and talk about the movie in depth wise and wateva but that would be a bit boring 4 me and prolly 4 those of u who r reading right now. I have 2 work 2moro which means pretty much no new years eve celebration, not that i really celebrate it by getting drunk and all that like a lot of ppl my age. I think ill just think back on the past year. Ive missed ppl this year, mainly Fiona and Lewis bcoz they now go 2 boarding skool, but i have missed otha ppl, who i saw almost evryday at skool. I hate 2 admit it but i miss petra, well i dont actually miss her but i miss the friendship we had last year b4 Josh entered our lives. He came between a lot of things in my life, but i cant blame him, he neva realised wat was happening. I wish so much that i could turn back the clock 2 the beginning of last yr. i was relatively happy then, well most days neway. I believed  all my friends cared then, unlike now where i have lost so much faith in them, well not all of them there r exceptions and those who read this r told if they r an exception. Im just generalizing. Im trying not 2 use names but it helps sumtimes if i do.  That was 1 long paragraph. Ne ways i was almost about 2 write about feeling like a lost soul but i wont. Ill try and have sum cheerfullness in this blog. The lyrics below i feel describe wat i think inside my head now days.  Behind Blue Eyes- Limp Bizkit  no one knows what it’s like  to be the bad man  to be the sad man  behind blue eyes   and no one knows  what it’s like to be hated  to be faded to telling only lies   chorus  but my dreams they aren’t as empty  as my conscious seems to be  i have hours, only lonely  my love is vengeance  that’s never free  no one knows what its like  to feel these feelings  like i do, and i blame you!   no one bites back as hard  on their anger  none of my pain woe  can show through  chorus   discover l.i.m.p. say it (x4)  no one knows what its like  to be mistreated, to be defeated  behind blue eyes  no one know how to say  that they’re sorry and don’t worry  i’m not telling lies  chorus   no one knows what its like  to be the bad man, to be the sad man  behind blue eyes.  Im not realloy a fan of limp bizkit but this song is so different 4 them. Neways off i go, buh bye.

      Well here i am 4 another blog. Its amazing yesterday i was thinking so much about my life and my past experiences. I guess ive been thinking a lot lately and not about what clothes i wanna buy, not all that materialistic stuff, but more of a spiritual side. Its like things used 2 be when hannah, lewis and i were really close, we used have amazing conversations at times about the one thing we had in common that no body else shared with us. I guess ive been missing the past lately. Neway back 2 my thinking, i feel ive reached a plateau (i think thats how u spell it). Ive realised sumthing that i have been so blind to see and i believe i have grown a bit. If mum hadnt of been on the computer all day yesterday i would have written a blog about my thoughts, but sum of those thoughts were scary. Yesterday i realised that even though my tenison "friends" r not wanting nething 2 do wit me (or at least most of them), which is kinda lonely, i prefer it 2 having 2 go 2 skool and watch them ignore me and hear there bitchy lil comments evry so often.   I feel so alone in this world, sumtimes i sit in my room b4 i go 2 bed and hope that ill go 2 sleep and neva wake up. I dont think id eva be able 2 say this stuff 2 ppl but i feel like im writing in my diary, when i write my blogs. I wish i didnt live here, i wish that i could b sumwhere else and b sum1 else but i cant. I feel trapped in this life that lays b4 me. my mum wants me 2 be a lawyer and she wants me 2 dance, and im afraid that i cant live up 2 her expectations. Im afraid i wont live up 2 ne1s expectations. I dont wanna be a lawyer but i do wanna dance but i dont want  it 2 take ova my life. I need balance. Im always searching 4 balance but i neva have it. I love my dancing and im meant 2 be talented but i know im not talented enough, so many competition judges r corrupt, it makes me wonder whether i will eva reach my dream. I want it so bad.  I feel an empitiness in my heart and soul and i feel it grow larger as evry day passes by, i want 2 fill it but i dont know wat with. im so lost and i have been 4 a while now. I fill my life with fake happiness 2 hide wat i really feel, i spend my money on materialistic things 2 try and boost my confidence that drops constently. I get told that im pretty but i dont believe it, i supposedly get checked out by guys all the time. They must be blind. No matter wat im told i hate myself and i hate this town and sum of the ppl and i hate my life. I just wish it would all go away but it neva will. I want it 2 end but it wont. I want ppl who i have lost faith in 2 prove 2 me that they care but they cant bcoz they dont know im hurting so much inside. nobody knows except the ppl who i let read this. I regret writing it all, but sum1 has 2 know. I have been crying out silently 4 help 4 so long but i neva receive it. the only way i deal with it is 2 put on that mask, the happy mask, so that i give evry1 evry day another opportunity and most days i am again left dissapointed and i dont know how long i can keep it together. But enough of this, i should stop, ive already said more than i eva wanted 2 reveal but it is already done. Until my next blog...

      Y is it so hard 2 start a blog. Mayb its just me... i neva know wat 2 write and by the time i should have finished i have so much more 2 write. Well yesterday was christmas, i thought it was going 2 be a fantastic day, but it was the same as it is every year. Dad telling annoying and reali bad jokes, andrew being a bit of a smart arse, mum feeling ill and grumpy after cooking and me trying 2 b happy with the day even though again it disatisfied me. Sumtimes i think it would b better not clelbrating christmas, i mean its lost all its meaning neway. Its just a way in which companies make money, children get spoilt and ppl eat till they cant eat nemore while there r starving children out there. It makes me sick when i think of it that way. I remember when i used 2 believe in santa, it was so much fun then. I wish i was a kid again, then i wouldnt have 2 think as much, worry as much and get hurt as much. And of course if i was still a lil girl i wouldnt have 2 worry about getting my heart broken.  Sumtimes, no a lot of the time i wish i had neva moved here. I wish we had of stayed in perth, i used not like it as much as melbourne but its betta then here. I guess u could say since moving here my happiness has detereated (excuse my spelling lol) and it still continues. I dont think i delve in2 that 2nite tho, i think ill go 2 bed, im tired and i have work 2moro...need sleep...lol. Well not that much that im falling asleep at da computer. Well until anotha entry, hope i havent bored whoeva reads this 2 much. AMybe ill add sum of my words of wisdom in my next entry.

      Ok here goes....my first blog. Im unsure of wat 2 write, how much 2 give away of the real me. I think I'll start with Sunday. Sunday was my most memorable day of the year, my ballroom Dancing exams. I enjoyed myself but nerves almost got the better of me during my Gold Star New Vogue, luckily everything turned out fine. Everything except my teacher falling over in the last dance of the day, which was with me. Im glad though, bcoz he got right back up again and we started the dance again. This mite be a bit confusing but thats me confusing.I was so happy with my results and my partner, Jason's results. Jason was awarded the encouragement award 4 2003 and got highly commended 4 his silver and gold composite. I acheived honours in my gold star new vogue and gold standard (Modern). And a special mention at the end of the day by the judge from melbourne topped the day off. I guess u could say my dreams r coming true.  It felt really weird going 2 work last nite after such a high from sunday. I guess im still on cloud nine. Neway on2 sumthing else. Im really worried about 1 of my friends, i think shes depressed even though she doesnt think so. I wish i knew that i could do sumthing, i feel so useless. I dont want another of my friends 2 commit suicide. When she tells me about how she feels, it reminds me so much of me, when i sink down in that pit of unhappiness and the days r so dark and there neva seems 2 be enough life 2 have the hope of getting through it. Sumtimes i wonder y we r here, y we live through this unhappiness with only seconds of true happiness in our lives in the grand scheme of things. It seems that we live only for happiness and love, but we suffer through hurt and pain hoping that 1 day we can reach the ultimate happiness. Is there an ultimate happiness, i doubt it at least not on this world. Maybe love is wat makes us happy, the fact of having our heart sing and be full of joy when we r near that person. But with everything comes complications, reason y it cant work and last foreva. But i guess thats life and we cant change it.  Neway enough of my weird thoughts, unitl next time...

      I cried 2day 4 da first time in a while. My parents r fighting again, mum considering moving out more than eva now. It has been bearable recently until now. I found out even more about y they r fighting. I would say but i dont think i should. Im trying 2 handle it maturally, but i cant. I dont wanna have 2 spit weekends or choose who 2 live wit. I would be so afraid i would hurt 1 of my parents if i choose the other. I guess i know wat a lot of my other friends have been through now. I dont know wat 2 do...  Neway on 2 sumthing else, I did sumthing bad yesterday. I had a ciggie. I know sum ppl r gonna b dissappointed in me but i just wanted 2 c wat it was like. I wont do it again tho. Btw i wasnt pressured in2 it, in fact one of my friends wasnt very happy when she found out and she had had like 6 that day. I went 2 da movies last nite wit Mez, we saw Rotk. I saw it 4 the 2nd time. I think its the best of the 3.   Neway thats all i have 2 write, farewell.

      Well ive been online 4 a while, thinking about wat i should write. I ve decided 2 just post sum lyrics 2day rather than talking about my pathetic life. (btw they r all by Evanescence).  "Tourniquet"  i tried to kill the pain but only brought more i lay dying and i'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal i'm dying praying bleeding and screaming am i too lost to be saved am i too lost?  my God my tourniquet return to me salvation my God my tourniquet return to me salvation  do you remember me lost for so long will you be on the other side or will you forget me i'm dying praying bleeding and screaming am i too lost to be saved am i too lost?  my God my tourniquet return to me salvation my God my tourniquet return to me salvation  my wounds cry for the grave my soul cries for deliverance will i be denied Christ tourniquet my suicide   "Imaginary"  i linger in the doorway of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name let me stay where the wind will whisper to me where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story  in my field of paper flowers and candy clouds of lullaby i lie inside myself for hours and watch my purple sky fly over me  don't say i'm out of touch with this rampant chaos - your reality i know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge  the nightmare i built my own world to escape  in my field of paper flowers and candy clouds of lullaby i lie inside myself for hours and watch my purple sky fly over me  swallowed up in the sound of my screaming cannot cease for the fear of silent nights oh how i long for the deep sleep dreaming the goddess of imaginary light  "My Immortal"   I’m so tired of being here suppressed by all of my childish fears and if you have to leave i wish that you would just leave because your presence still lingers here and it won't leave me alone   these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears and i've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me  you used to captivate me by your resonating light but now i'm bound by the life you left behind your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears and i've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me  i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone and though you're still with me i've been alone all along

      I have a date for nxt week, at least i think its a date. It involved a guy (who shall remain nameless) asking me 2 c a movie or hangout wit him. Would u count that as a date? Neway i have been thinking about it 2day. If it is a date then aftawards he mite wanna hook up wit me. Atm i dont wanna hook up wit ne1. Altho da last couple of months i had been thinking that i wanted a bf, but 2day i realised that i dont. Im partly afraid that da past will repeat itself, but i also know that i only like him as a friend. I know that i wont fall in love wit him, and the infatuation that i have felt the last couple of days towards him that has made me blind has dissappeared. Now im scared. I hate having ppl fall 4 me and have me not be able 2 return the feelings. But i know my heart does not lie wit him but wit sum1 else (who shall also remain nameless).  Maybe im just afraid, like i said afraid of my past repeating itself. The whole Josh scenario happening, not the almost stalking part and evrything. The part where i said yes when he asked me out not knowing at all y, then having him fall in love wit me and me do da stupid thing and say that i loved him when i didnt and then have my parents think he was fanatastic so then when i wanted 2 break up wit him they didnt want me 2. Thats only plays a minor role tho, the fact is i cannot give my heart 2 him no matter wat bcoz i dont feel that way about him. i told a friend last nite on the fone that if this guy she knows likes her she should go out wit him even tho she loves sum1 else. I cant believe i said that bcoz i myself could neva do that. And i refuse 2. Now i dont know wat 2 do, should i make up an excuse y i cant c amovie wit him or should i go and then if he makes a move say that i thought it was just friends hanging out 2gether, nothing more. Well luckily i have 2moro and monday 2 think about it, maybe even longer.  neways i betta go, enough bout guys.  One day ur prince will come, mine just took a wrong turn, got lost and is 2 stubborn to ask 4 directions.  Love hides behind evry corner...i must be walking in circles  Buh Bye  PS btw i am not in love wit the 2nd nameless guy mentioned, i just like him more than a friend, theres sumthing about him, but i dunno wat it is.

      I just had an amazing thought while i was logging on, well actually its not amazing at all, its more of a question. Wheneva i am on msn most of the convos begin with hey, how r u? But when ppl ask how u r they r not really wanting a truthful answer. I guess ppl expect u 2 say that ur gd even if u r fantastic or feeling like shit. Rather odd when u think about it. Well 2day is Mez's b'day. HAPPY BIRTHDAY MEZ!!!!   Today Rob (my manager) rang up and told me that all casuals hours have been cut, so i have like no hours. Im annoyed, but theres nothing i can do. Well it gives me more time 2 sit around and wonder wat life is really about. Its strange i sumtimes now dread going 2 work but when im there i enjoy it.Theres Jacinta (jac 4 short) even tho we r very different, ive taken a liking 2 her. She seems like she could b a gd friend and i guess gd friends r wat i need rite now. Then theres Kellie (my brothers ex) who i love 2 bits. She has such a kind heart, and i wish so much that my brother hadnt done wat he did 2 her, but i believe she is 2 gd 4 him neway. Theres also Philip, hes nice. Im not sure how i could describe him. He seems mysterious, but at the same time also like an open book, if thats possible. And of course there is Laura, shes lovely and always replies 2 my msgs! There is also Nathan, hes a tenison guy and a friend of Josh Wiles's but he is nice aswell. Sure he pays me out occassionally but its all joking around (I hope). And there r many others like Kacey, Sarah, Rebecca and Alarna. All very nice ppl.  Neways I need 2 write about sumthing more interesting but i cant think of nething. Hmmm... well the otha day, i think it was wednesday Fiona came ova and gave me my b'day pressie and chrissy pressie, both were late but thats ok. The chrissy pressie was a perfume with a matching deodorant which smells really nice. But the birthday pressie was the best. It was a blank calendar that she had decorated herself. In it were pictures form early last year and mainly late the year b4. Wheneva i flip through the pages of it i feel like crying, bcoz there r so many fantastic memories. All the photos were taken b4 evrything changed, b4 petra turned bitch towards me and b4 fiona and lewis went 2 boarding skool. I neva knew looking bak on the happy moments would make me want 2 cry.  I wonder if neway actually reads my mumbo jumbo, i hope sum1 does so then mayb 1 day when i write sumthing intelligent, sum1 will read & think wow that is so true. Neway off i go again until another blog. Buh bye readers.

      Hello ppl  Right now i would love 2 pour my heart and soul out and write all the mixed emotions that im feeling, but alas like usual i am afraid. There r sum things that evry1 must keep a secret from the world, and like evry1 else i have my secrets. Its more my emotions that i keep secret. It does however cause me 2 stand alone in my darkest hours so 2 speak. Here i am again sinking in2 the dark abyss of nothingness. Have u eva felt that life is just passing u by, that u r living ur life in sum kind of trance, where u r too afraid 2 feel, too afraid 2 take risks, too afraid 2 live? I fell that is happening 2 me. For once in a quite a long time i am questioning who i am, i think i know the answer 2 sum of my problems atm all i need 2 do is be motivated. Sum of my answers may lie in Wicca. Im not going 2 delve very deep in2 wicca. It is sumthing that helped me through hard times in the past and i hope will be able 2 help me again. I always thought i would be strong 2 my belief in wicca but as my life became busier and my passion for dancing increased it has dropped down 2 a lower priority on my list. But as i have been thinking 2day i realise that it was wicca that helped me through the harder times by just doing a little meditation now and then was enough. So ova da next week i will be reading and learning again about it all for my own mental, physical and spiritual well being. Till next time.  Lisa  "Every living thing dies alone."

      I made a new friend last week!!!! Her name is Kate and she lives a couple of houses down from me. We walked home on friday wit Josh and Ashley. We walked sum of the way wit Luke and Kenny, they r kinda odd but neways. Kate and i made a promise not 2 smoke again, but she broke it last nite lol. I didnt get nething 4 valentines day, but mez did! Im worried tho, i pretty sure its real but a part of me thinks it mite be a very bad joke. I think thats just me bcoz ppl at tenison would do that i dont think ne1 would do it 2 mez at mount coz shes is friends wit evry1. I hope 4 her its not a sick joke.  On 2 other news... i have 2 turn off the "lisa charm" (as jim calls it) coz 2 many guys like me. Sure im flattered but they r all the same, theres nothing that makes ne of them stand out from the rest. They dont have that special sumthing that makes them different.   OMG i get 2 have a 16th b'day party, i made a list of those who i want 2 invite and there is like 40 ppl. And thats mainly the girls i know. I didnt realise i had that many friends or i will have by october. lol. The ones that rnt exactly my friends at the moment will be over time, i do know them and talk 2 them of course.  Neways i betta go and have tea and do more hw, buh bye.  PS mez its not very nice 2 go offline witout saying gdbye...he he he only kidding hun. GD luck 4 2moro!

      Its been a while since my last blog. I dont know wat is happening 2 me. i feel like im 2 different ppl in 1 body. Part of me wants 2 go get pissed and have fun like other teenagers do but the other part of me says no and wants 2 be responsible. I feel very torn between these 2 parts. Maybe its bcoz of my parents, the way they r really strict. Maybe it makes me want 2 rebel, im not sure.   On 2 otha news, im going 2 be doing the deb, hopefully jason will go wit me otherwise i dont know who ill ask. I guess i could ask sum1 from tenison but i dunno. I got sum1 2 go wit mez. She really wanted 2 go and im glad she can now. Things r gd at mount, im glad 2 be away from tenison, i guess i realise now how much betta my time here in mt g ould have been if i hadnt gone 2 tenison. I do misss things, things like familiarity but im getting ova it. The freedom at mount is fantastic tho.  Things r pretty shit at home, i was really unhappy last thursday and i know it showed. i couldnt help it. Ive had a headache since then, i think it mite be from stress. The stress from my parents and evrything thats happening wit them. I dunno wat 2 do. I know there r ppl arround me i can talk 2 about it and that is great but i just dont know if i will. Some1 smart told me that we cannot stand alone. i dont want 2 stand alone but i feel that i ahve 2 this time. I have stood alone b4 and its so hard. I just dont think im ready 2 tell ne1 yet.   Im feeling confused and lost but at the same time happy, is that weird?

      Im a bit upset this morning, for stupid reasons as usual. Last nite i went out wit Debs, Jmara, Jeremy, Nathan and Hayden. Afta work they piked me up from my house and we went 2 Jmaras where Debs decided she needed 2 go home 2 get sum more clothes coz she couldnt decide wat 2 wear, then we went bak 2 Jmaras and Nathan and Jeremy left. Debs, Jmara and I just hung out 4 a while dancing 2 music and having a bit 2 drink and then we walked 2 Maccas where we were meant 2 meet Kate and Bec, but they had a car full of ppl already so they couldnt pik us up. So we called Jeremy and Nathan, HAyden and him came 2 pik us up. We went driving around out 2 the pines and stuff then we went 2 see da possums coz Debs had neva seen a possum b4. We drove around a bit more and then they dropped me off at home and that was my nite. It was fun, but I wish I had opf been allowed 2 stay out l8er than 10. I would have stayed at Debs last nite except that it is my brothers 18th birthday 2day and mum wanted us 2 have a special breakfast 4 him this morning. Im annoyed at myself a lot bcoz when Im around a guy who I find atrractive and kinda like I get very shy and it pisses me off. I wanted so bad 2 impress Jeremy but Im not his type, hence the reason I hate being shy. Im too prim or sumthing. I know he likes Debs, I could just tell if u know wat I mean, Im not angry at her i would be so happy for her if he did like her im just a lil upset that theres was nothing btween him and I. I dno its prolly stupid but its how I feel. Neway at least I meet sum new ppl last nite, overall it was fun even if i didnt pik up which is gd in sum respects. Neway i betta go, i have 2 clean the house.   Cya,  *Lisa*

      Hello ppl  Today i was told sumthing i didnt want 2 hear but im glad i was told it. At first it was like a slap across the face, but the more i thought about it i realized its true. I feel like tearing my brain apart tho bcoz part of me is saying its so true lisa and the other part is saying no its not true they have no idea. But i know that its true, the rational side knows this at least neway. Its like waking up from a dream or more like a nightmare. I dno wats going on in my head, its like its all screwed up. Im confused... so confused.. so unsure and afraid. I want 2 change, im gonna change, im not gonna blow my problems out of proportion anymore im gonna stop being selfish, all of it is gonna change. This may sound confusing but all thats important is that i know wat im talking about and that all of u out there know that u should listen 2 ur enemies, they tell u ur faults.  Gdnite readers, all 2 of u i believe, but that is enough 4 me. 2 ppl who i trust so much and 2 ppl who r interested in my deeper thoughts.

      Vulnerable. It is defined as:  1. without adequate protection: open to emotional or physical danger or harm. 2. MILITARY open to attack: exposed to an attack or possible damage. 3. extremely susceptible: easily persuadable or liable to give in to temptation. 4. physically or psychologically weak: unable to resist illness, debility, or failure. 5. BRIDGE liable to increased stakes: liable to higher penalties as well as bonuses, having won one game of a rubber.  My vulnerability is 1. without adequate protection: open to emotional or physical danger or harm. Some ppl played a very sick, immature and inconsiderate joke on me. The culprits were Jim and Josh. It was sumthing i could expect Josh 2 do but not jim, it seems very out of character for him. Well 2 start at the beginning, i was talking 2 Jim on msn ( i should have saved the convo but i thought of that aftawards.)and he was saying that he was feeling suicidal and depressed. He said it was bcoz of personal stuff and becoz he thought josh may have killed himself bcoz the last time they talked josh had slashed his wrists up. At this point i was getting really worried, scared and upset 4 both of them, i suprised myself by actually caring about josh at that time. I was trying 2 offer advice and sought out the problem to a certain degree until jim said that it was all a joke, in fact he had neva seen josh happier. I cant believe sum1 could make a joke about suicide, i mean i think this town has gotten a big wake up call since the passings of aaron and paul. I may have not known aaron and barely known paul but it affected me, it made me take suicide so much more seriouslya dn realise its not sumthing 2 joke about and its not sumthing u should do bcoz its hurts so many ppl. And then 2 follow when i had a go at them saying that it was a sick joke and all, josh had the nerve 2 say 2 me that i should just shut up and stop thinking that my life is shittier than every1 elses and stop being selfish and grow up. I neva realised that caring was immature but it must be if josh says so right? I know that i still have 2 grow up a lot more but i think that wat the 2 of them did was immature and inconsiderate, they would neva have dared do that 2 kristina, she would have taken it worse than me. Well enough of that, catchas l8er  *Lisa*

      Hey,  Its been a while. I havent been coming on the net much coz my msn has been stuffed so there wasnt much reason to come online. Things have been fantastic lately in my life apart from a few bumps along the way. Im officially on school holidays now, I had my last exam yesterday. I publish my results when i get them, if they r not too bad that is. My Deb was last saturday night. It was a fantastic night. I was pampered all day! I got my nails done, my hair styled beautifully, fake tanned and my face was turned beautiful wi8th a great job by mel from giannis with my make up. All this with my beautiful dress and matching jewelery i felt like a princess. I could definatley do that for the rest of my life lol. It was amazing, after the formal part was over I swarmed by my guests with cameras. Clicking everywhere, smiling and poseing all the time. It was fun to be in the limelight for once. Anyway i have to go ill talk about all that has happened in more detail l8er. Cya.

      Hey ppl  The weirdest thing ever happened last night, well i suppose its not that weird, more unexpected than weird. I was at Kates house and we having a D and M when my friend Fiona rang me. She said that we had both gotten an email from Josh. Heres the unexpected part... it was an apologetic email. This is what it said:  Hi,  Look guys i need to say this...  Sorry  I am really sorry. I really am. My life has been fucked up the last couple of months really... maybe longer and im really sorry that i took it out on you. I know it was most definatly not the right thing to do. I admit what I did was incredibly wrong, illegal i believe. And i know sorry doesnt fix it but im just saying it cos well... i still love yous. You guys were great friends and in quite literal terms... I fucked that up. As I said Ive been through some trying times and ive copt a fair bit from people for what ive done to you. My anger has been building up for a long time. Well you would be pretty pissed if you had been moved around in the space of 12 months like a fucken hermit crab (sorry i couldnt think of a better analogy). But it is no reason for me to take it out on you. One more time I say sorry to you. I dont expect forgiveness. All I ask is that you read this and reply. It mite be the first steps I need to help me to recover.  Have a nice day Josh  I replied saying...  Im not really sure what to reply, im not sure if what u said is true, or whether its just another trick. I would like to believe its true, but honestly, i dont have any trust for u. It could be 1 big game, i dont know, but u asked for a reply. So here i am replying, pretty much speechless.  From Lisa  Then he wrote back:  hey i know that you cant trust me. i havent done much for you to trust me. but this no joke. no game. no trick. i would love for you to believe me. but i know it takes time and effort for someone to trust another human being. this next bit is me speaking from the heart about why i was so angry towards you. look lisa you and me were good friends. but you really did break my heart. i was in love with you. i thought you were everything a guy could want in a girl. you were kind. you were caring. you were funny. you were heaps of things. but when we broke up it really hurt me. i turned how you mite... crazy? i have never been the same since then. but what i didnt realise in all my bitterness was that you and me could be great mates. instead i was stupid enough to start fucking that up by treating you like shit. treating other around you like shit. but in times of great need... you were still there. amazing. i can still remember when i walked to your place in the rain, and we had a pillow fight. at that point i remembered all the good times we had together and how much i missed them. so you would of thought at that point i would of changed. but i didnt. i became even more bitter and twisted. when i moved it hurt me. i was far away from friends who loved me. and i took it out on you. and fiona. two people who did care about me. but why did i do that? i suppose it was because you hurt me. i was still bitter about when you broke up with me. i was bitter about when you went out with jim. but i realise now that i was so so so stupid for doing that. i had absolutly no right to take my anger out on you. or fiona. it is seriously something that i wish i could go back and erase. im sorry lisa...  i really am  have a nice day josh... p.s i hope you know i was in tears writing this. it brought back lots of memories. most happy     Neways i g2g buh bye  Lisa xx

       Today was shit... and thats all i really have to say. Well thats not entirely true i have lots to say. I love school holidays because u get a break from everything and everyone but i hate them aswell. A lot of the time i spend too much time thinking, picking every aspect of me and my life to pieces. I hate that i know my faults and others see them easily no matter how hard i try to hide them, but yet i am still unable to change in a gd way Whenever i think i have changed in a gd way, another person hates me or openly admits to gd friends of mine what they think of me. I hate this cruel, cruel world. I hate how so many ppl r so cruel but the worst part is i know i am cruel just like them. Im searching for answers to complicated question that i hope will lead me to happiness, but instead the searching causes hurt to others and myself.     &nbsp;   Another thing, love is overrated. I hate it... its meant to beautiful but thats bullshit. How can it be beautiful if u hide it from ppl, how can it be beautiful if someone says they love u and then later hate u or even hit u. Its not beautiful and like everything else it not perfect. And by saying this im sure u can tell that i want to love and be loved...     &nbsp;   Neways thats just a piece, a small fraction of my state of mind atm.     &nbsp;   Lisa xx   &nbsp;  P.S i have finally given in to the fact that i love pink and i dont care what ppl say im gonna wear it as much as i like, (plus its so in fashion for spring!!).    &nbsp;

      Lets see, today i went to work and spoke to Fiona earlier on this evening. She has been getting abusive emails from that cunt Josh wiles. Yes im not afraid to post wat I think of hijm on my blog, i have nothing to hide. He has left a horrible mark on everyones life who cared about him at some time or another. I broke his heart so he decided to put me through hell and back, now i wont give him the attention he craves (abusive email and sms replies) so he goes and abuses one of my gd friends who has been one of the most loyal person towards him. She has never listened when ppl including me have payed the crap out of him and told her how much of a horrible person he is and this is wat he shows her in return. As u can see i am pretty much furious. The old me probably would have already sent an abusive email to him about the whole situation but there comes a time when ur sick of sending abusive almost hateful emails and messages to someone who only returns more abusive emails, message and phone calls. Theres more to life than being stuck in a never ending circle of hate, bcoz everytime they say something it brings u down and everytime u say something it brings u down aswell. I hope that Fiona will not get stuck in that same circle, for her sake. It cant be healthy. Anyways i have completely lost my train of thought there bcoz i have been talking to my good friend from melbourne, Georgina. Just b4 i go offline i will post the convo, im not sure why but i feel like it. It most likely bcoz i dont have much to remember her by.   So here it is, some things r blanked out tho. The actual convo is in bold so u dont get confused with the names.   I cant run nemore, i give myself 2 u, in all my bitterness, i ignored all thats real and true, all i need is u says:   hey   g e o r g i e . p o r g y . p u d d i n g . & . p i e... says:   hey   g e o r g i e . p o r g y . p u d d i n g . &amp; . p i e... says:   how r u hun??   Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings, I feel so small... I guess i need u baby says:   gd how r u?   g e o r g i e . p o r g y . p u d d i n g . & . p i e... says:   yer i have been sick   Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings, I feel so small...

      Hey  Im on msn talking to Claire and Josh. I had a fantastic day today with Claire, it was so fun. But now im kinda angry coz im taling to Josh. I dont trust him. I know even now after it has been ages since he has been in my life, i am still affected by the past. I need closure from the whole situation but he wants to be friends and all i want is closure and then for him to go away. It may sound mean but thats wat i feel i want. Comments or advice would be really helpful right now because i am so confused about the whole situation. Atm only Kate knows how it is all affecting me but im gonna say it now, because i dont care who reads it. I havent had a bf since Jim which was like 12 months ago. Sure ive had opportunities, but at first iwas like nah i wanna stay single, but really that was just hiding the truth. Then it was i dont like them in that way. But now the reason is that i want to make sure that i really like them because i dont want what happened with josh to happen again. It may sound stupid but past experiences affect people differently and this is how this particular experience has affected me.  He wants me to yell and scream at him but what is the point?  Lisa xx  P.S maybe another day ill post the convo on here.
