      Happy Birthday Big E!!!  Update on my weekend.  Friday afternoon, I made several errand stops for the homefront.  First I had 5 yards of mulch delivered for C's garden.  I then went to the tag office to get a new license plate for C's new van.  I then went to the post office to mail the tags and my son's music for HS band.  I then went to Abra Auto Body for an estimate to fix my car.  I scheduled repair to start Tuesday, June 29.  I then went down to Coweta Custom Carpentry to look at some sheds for the back yard.  I immediately picked one out but was put on hold due to permits.  Apparently I need a permit to get the shed installed.  Shit!  Then I went to Circuit City to buy a new computer to fix the broken one.  Got a cheap HP Celeron computer.  I think a power thing wacked my computer.  Saturday morning I got up early cause the mulch was getting delivered.  I then started to move some dirt and weeds out of C's garden.  Tough work.  The mulch never showed before I had to leave.  I cleared about 4 square feet Saturday morning.  I then proceeded to wash cars for the HS band fees.  I worked for 4 hours and made a whopping $14 bucks.  Not sure it was worth it now.  Decided I could get a movie at Blockbuster instead of going to the movies.  I rented Timeline and Matrix.  What a waste of human effort.  Sunday, got up, showered, shaved, dressed and off to church only to leave early because of a biggotted homo speech by the assistant to the minister.   Left church, went home and worked on the garden the rest of the day.  I cleared quite a bit of weeds, and the it started to rain and rain and rain.  I thought I could work through it, but thought better of it.  It only lasted about 15 minutes and then I went back to work.  I wanted to get the bare dirt covered before the weeds had a chance to get back growing.  I covered it with about 4-5 inches of mulch.  Mowed the front lawn.  Looks like crap due to the excess of grass.  Then showered, Long Horn T-bone for dinner.  I saw Shrek 2 last night.  I liked the ending.  Funny how donkey has some kids now with dragon.  Went to bed and back to work today.  Got a call from Piedmont painting today to estimate painting the house.  The garage door should be fixed now.  TG!  That's all I got.  Kevin

      Another boring day.  Last night I got home late.  So I went to the Grocery store to get some dinner.  Watched TV and went to bed early.  10:30.  I've started the process to get the house painted.  I called to companies.  I'm extremely concerned about getting ripped off.  I'll let you know how it goes.  My son is supposed to be in band practice all summer.  Unfortunately he is not here.  I think he's going to come home and go to practice.  No choice. C is so very concerned about communication, but I'm on top of it.  I'm trying to be responsible.  A new job, new responsibility, new budget, new diet.  Let's see how long this lasts.  Otherwise everything is going great.  I gotta get the house cleaned up, lots of cat hair everywhere, do laundry, and fix that f'ing computer.  Oh yeah!  I turned the AC back on, but I set it to 82 downstairs and 80 upstairs.  I think the computer broke because of the heat.  The garage door will be fixed on Monday.  I'm still looking for a shed out back.    Still like my job.  I'm working on documentation for some scipts.  Until next time.  Kevin

      My fricking computer broke while I was on vacation.  I can't get it to turn on.  That's a real pain in the ass.  I think I'll buy a new cheap one at circuit city tonight.  We'll see.  Yesterday, I worked, came home, mowed the lawn, ate dinner, watched TV and went to bed.  I have a real exciting life.  The people who were going to fix my garage door didn't show up.  They say I didn't confirm, although I did.  I'll reschedule.  Not much else going on.

      A week at the beach...  It's been great.  I haven't been fighting with the wife or kids.  The weather has cooperated and been sunny everyday.  Monday afternoon the cousin-in-law joined us for a couple of days.  It was nice talking with her and learning about her industry...News.  She works for a small newspaper in the south.  I got a little burnt the first day and have been avoiding the beach ever since.  I like the beach, but I'd prefer to just sit and sleep on the beach without any distractions.  Of course with 4 kids that's not possible.  C (wife) would say she's done the brunt of the work her anyway.  I've made sure that I've spent some alone time with each child, giving them things, talking and walking.  I've enjoyed this the most of all.  Tuesday we celebrated, father-in-law's 75th birthday.  Uncle B reserved a place called the "corner cupboard."  We had steak and crabcakes.  It was delicious and a very nice place.  The ambiance and company were wonderful.  I ate too much though and had to get up for a walk.  I kind of felt anti-social but explained that I just ate too much.   We've had Grotto's pizza all week.  It's getting a little old.  Besides I'm psyching myself for the diet I'm going on for the remainder of the summer.  As has been expressed to be my my own children and nephew, I'm fat.  You wouldn't really guess it from looking at me, but I have about 40-50 pounds to lose.  I hope to lose 20 by the end of the summer.  When school starts in the fall it'll be harder since the routine of life will begin again.    Sounds like a great week, doesn't it...But how come I'm so miserable.  If it wasn't for the kids and family I'd have bolted a long time ago.  I can't stand the constant lack of affection from anyone other than my kids.  Tomorrow is C's birthday.  I'll try to make it as nice as possible, but I doubt she'll have anything to do with it.  I'll let you know in the next post.  Last night I told C that I'm miserable.  She doesn't touch, love, talk or anything else.  I know she's depressed, but refuses to let anyone help her.  I've been through therapy and all I've learned is that happiness is a state of being.  What? you say.  Basically, choose to be happy, choose to be angry, choose to be depressed.  I'm choosing to be happy, in spite of all the crap in this shitty situation.  C just went to bed without a single pat on the back, "good night", kiss or anything.  This caused me to stay awake for several more hours before I finally went to sleep.   Shit, just kill me now.  As I sit here drinking coffee writing this blog, C's on the beach with all the kids.  She's probably wondering how great I have it by being alone and not being part of the family.  Bullshit...misery is misery.  I've been avoiding due to the lack of anything from anyone.  I think I could really go for a bottle of whiskey.  Good thing whiskey tastes horrible and drinks like fire down my throat.  I could never be an alcoholic.  Perhaps, I'm pushing C away.  But, I think it's mutual.  We both hate each other right now.  No talk, no touch, no sex, no nothing.  Who can live like this!    Now, I'm back to the beach to spend time with the kids and family...put on a fake smile and let everyone know how well I'm doing... Run now...run!   I don't know how people leave their kids, but I could run off somewhere, serve hamburgers at McDonald's and just chill with no responsibility.  Anyway, here we go.  Happy Birthday C!  I do love you...Get better.  K

      Didn't do much last night.  Just sat around and watched a bunch of rich guys play poker on TV.  I did take the trash out and my cat escaped.  Big deal, cept' my wife and daughter would freak.  I couldn't find him, although I did walk around the house a couple times looking for him.  Dumb cat.  Anyway I went to bed and woke up in the middle of the night (for no reason).  I got up and went to the door and the cat was waiting to get in.  Thank god.  everything is good so far...  We finally got our home equity loan financing worked out.  My wife is out of town and the brilliant people at Wells Fargo seem to think I cannot use a Power of Attorney to get the papers signed.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  We'll sign them Monday when we're together.  Thank god that's done.  I'm working on my Mom's medicaid papers.  Apparently Fairfax county lost the originals I sent them.  So now if have to redo all the work.  Of course, I didn't make a copy so I'm screwed regarding the original documents I sent them.    I'm having difficulty getting my car repaired after an accident on May 21.  Can't get ahold of the insurance company responsible for fixing my vehicle.  Another saga in my life.  I can't wait to go to the beach, get drunk and build sand castles next week.  Tonight I played golf with my neighbor David and had a great time.  It's nice to be with friends.  I played not well in the beginning.  On my second shot I hit a car driving near the fairway.  Oooops!  I then proceeded to squander my game until Number 9 where I hit a 200+ drive and then hit the green on my second shot.  I lipped the put from about 20 and tapped in for par.  That's what keeps you coming back.  It's warm in the house...Remember I turned off the AC.  Sweat, sweat, sweat!!!  I had a big salad and a tuna sandwich for dinner.  Not too bad health wise.  I could have skipped the bread though.  That no carb thing is for the birds.  I've gotta clean the house before I go to the beach.  So much for tonight.  See ya tomorrow.

      Beaurcracy sucks.  I hate the place where my Mom lives.  They are a bunch of assholes.  Cretins.  They tell me they going to kick her out and file some papers to make her private pay.  I got news...I ain't paying nothing. %$#^&!!  Busy day.  1)  my garage door is broken I have to come up with $600 to fix it.  2)  No news on fixing my car from accident a couple weeks before I started this.  3)  Have to come up with $1200 for hawaii trip #1, $5000 for Hawaii trip #2.  4)  Can't sign my equity loan papers.  Wells Fargo won't let me "power of Attorney" my wifes name.    Work is going well.  I like it here still.  I feel like I'm respected again.  That's all for now.

      I couldn't sleep last night.  Could have been cause I napped in the afternoon.  Anyways, I'm somewhat tired today.  I hope I go to bed early tonight.  I "mostly" finished my AIX script at work today.  It's really silly but I think it's an accomplishment.  I had two Chicago dogs for lunch at Saucy Dog.  It's been awhile since I have a good dog.  I like working here so far.  Just keeping my cool and learning.  Went to meeting for daughters soccer team.  She made the "A" team.  It's going to be expensive but worth it.  She really enjoys it.    Didn't get home till almost 8 and had a late supper and went to bed.  I thought I could get to painting the kitchen cabinets but haven't had time.  The house is a mess and smells like cat.  I gotta do something.

      How I spent my summer...today I went to church and learned about Romans 7.  The sermon was on Genesis 12:9.  I didn't understand the message.  Something about finding your path with God as the guide.  I took an unexpected nap but managed to mow the back lawn and wacked the weeds.  I meant to go out to get something for dinner, but just ate what was in the kitchen...cheap steak and a big salad.  I've bought some paint to paint the kitchen cabinets.  I gotta get on that before I leave this weekend to see the family and go to the beach.  Back to work tomorrow.  I'm somewhat uncomfortable with the script writing, but I'll get better as I have to write more.  I've got a good job now.  Not much pressure.  Just learning about the systems and apps.  Anyways, a simple day.  Another tomorrow.

      It’s been several weeks since my last update to this blog. Primarily because work has blocked the blog site as pornography. Such as life…  July 13, 2004 – the week started out pretty normal. I still had Pat coming in to perform handy man stuff to the house. The house painters had arrived and began to paint the exterior. They power washed the house and caulked. Before this occurred though I decided to remove the air conditioner unit from my bedroom window to the sills could get painted. I unplugged the unit and carefully removed the screws holding it in place. I then gently opened the window with a hand on the unit to keep it from falling. However as soon as the window was open the AC went flying out the window to crash some 40’ below. Pausing to look out the window I decided the AC was a lost cause, closed the window and went to work. Subsequently, I’ve had some friends laugh out loud over this incident. In retrospect it was funny, but still pisses me off, cause I only bought the unit to save on the electric bill. It’s all a loss due to the annihilation of the air conditioner.  July 14, 2004 – Went to work as normal. Started to work on the new system the office purchased. That’ll help understand the system better. I got home at the normal time and had an appointment to get more life insurance. The new job doesn’t have the life insurance coverage as the last one. I chose a Universal Life policy with a cash value. This should protect us for the next few years until the kids get out of college and the house is paid off.  July 15, 2004 – I went to the dentist for the first time in about two years. I’ve had difficulty finding a dentist I liked. No cavities. Nice boring teeth. LeaAnn took Nick to band practice at 9:00 a.m. The Fisher’s picked him up at noon. Thank God for them. It’d been a real pain to get Nick to practice and the dentist at exactly the same time.  The painters are working like crazy around the house. I don’t think they take any breaks. They work like dogs, to my advantage though. The rest of the day went normal.  July 17, 2004 – Saturday morning Nick and I went over to the school to help clean the concession stand. The area was in deep need of cleaning. We power washed the walls and floors. It’s amazing how much pigeons can crap. After about an hour or so into the cleaning I was getting quite frustrated at Nick for just loafing. I said some things to him but it didn’t help. I had thought perhaps it was me so I asked another volunteer to work with him. After about 20 minutes he came back to me to let me know that he understands why I was so frustrated. I then laid one on Nick letting him know is behavior was unacceptable and he better shape up. This sent him into emotional despair. I backed off and let him just hang out. When we got home I pretty much let him have it that his attitude sucked and he better shape up. He can be sure that he’ll be helping every dirty job the band has to offer until he learns.  That afternoon I worked on the garden from 3 until 8 pm. I finished weeding the garden and laid a thick layer of mulch down. It now looks great. I’m glad it’s finally done.  July 18, 2004 – Went to church. Lazy day.  July 19-23, 2004 – Not much happening. The painters finished painting the house. Pat finished the basement ceiling. Nick had a dentist appointment on Tuesday. He was informed he had four cavities. Thursday he went back to get them filled and his teeth protected. He now knows the pleasure of Novocain. Friday night I dropped the civic off to get the brakes replaced. I then went to dinner at Chin Chin’s with David and Taylor. (neighbors and good friends).  July 24, 2004 – The house is a pigsty and C is coming home Monday. Oh well! Nick spent the morning packing and getting ready for band camp. I picked my car up at 3:00 and took him to target and Linen’s and Things to get him some things for his trip. Almost $200 later he’s all ready. New portable CD player, food stuff, pillow and sheets for dorm beds. Also a new CD from itunes. We dropped off his luggage at school around 6:00 pm. Said “Hi” to a few of the fellow band parents and off we went.  Sunday morning we slept in. Dropped Nick off at 12:30 and away he went to band camp. I hope he’s having fun. Got a call around 11:00 pm that he arrived safely. It was raining on the trip to camp. This only caused minor delays.  Spent the rest of the day picking up the house and cleaning. I mopped the kitchen floor, power washed the cement walkway in front of the house. To the best of my ability the house is clean.  July 26, 2004 – Carol and the kids come home. Hurray they are home. Great celebration. I’m so glad to see them. Went to Long Horn for dinner. I didn’t feel like cooking.  The rest of the week went normal. Carly has soccer camp this week and a sleep over Friday. So it all starts just like it left off.  July 30, 2004 – Nick comes home today. Carly goes to her sleepover. Another busy day managing the kids.

      This morning I sent Nick off to band practice with LeaAnn. She's a great friend and help. I then went to the dentist. I haven't been to a dentist in several years. Thankfully though my teeth are fine with no issues.  I have to finish a script for the new system install next week.

      I left for work this morning around 7:00 a.m.  I stopped by WalMart to see if they had the new Jimmy Buffett album out yet...no such luck.  I'll try again later.  When I got to work the shocker came that my immediate manager Dave has announced his retirement.  I immediately talked with my co-worker and let her know I was interested in taking his place.  I didn't want to appear to climb over her.  She said, "That's fine, I don't want it."  I then sent an email to my director and had a little talk.  For starters I'll get some of Dave's projects and then we'll see.  Gene, the director, says he's interested in starting a technical services group to manager storage, large systems (unix) and small systems (windows).  I hope I can become a leader to manager this group.  so far this has been a good move for me.  I'm keeping my mouth shut when I need to and speak when I need to.  So far so good.  The painters are painting my house this week.  Pat is finishing some of his handiman projects I'm contracting him for.  Nick is bored.  I don't know what to really do, other than counsel him to call his friends.  I can get him a ride to his friends house if he likes.

      Sunday, Nick and I hung low and didn't do much.  Went to church and spent the rest of the day lying around the house.  This morning, got up, dressed, went to work.  I was worried that Nick's ride to the Mission Monday thing was going to get messed up, so I sent an email to the Uth coordinator to make sure he's giving Nick a ride.  All is well and Nick has plans for the day.  He'll get home before me, but we should get home about the same time.  BANK OF AMERICA is the shittiest bank on the planet earth.  After having an account for only 2 weeks, they've managed to charge me $37 in fees and bounce my car payment even though the money was in the account.  Some bullshit about a 5 day bank hold.  I'm closing my account.  They can shove it up their ass!!!  I ain't spending more money to spend my money.  Crappy bank, crappy bank.  Got dinner, pork chops and broccoli and got Nick to band practice.  Spent the rest of the evening watching the home run derby on espn.  Went to bed at eleven.

      Last night, Nick and I spent some time putting the furniture back in the family room.  It looks really different, good, with the wainscoting.  Pat did a great job.  Nick proved to be very helpful also.  The family room looks great, even though it needs a coat of paint.  Went to bed around 11:00 p.m.  Saturday morning we got up around 9:00 a.m. to start yard work.  Nick and I trimmed the bushes.  We got the bushes trimmed in front of the living room when I decided to try a gas powered hedge trimmer.  Nick called Nickel rental and was told they had one in stock, but when we got there none was available.  Piss ants!  We proceeded over to Abra Autobody to get some stuff that I left in the car they found when repairing the bumper...keys.  Then down 29 bypass to Coweta Equipment rental.  They had one.  We rented it for 4 hours.  It made quick work on the bushes and we were done by 12:45.  We returned the trimmer and stopped at Lowes to get some weed killer and garden gloves.  Then off to the movie theatre.  We saw Spiderman 2.  I saw it for the second time.  I think I feel asleep during part of the movie.  Nick enjoyed the flick.  We had Coke and popcorn as a snack.  This was essentially lunch.    Then back home to pick up the trimmings.  This took a couple more hours.  Nick was a great help today.  We barely spook an ill word to eachother.  It's nice to work with him without arguing all the time.  The little trailer we borrowed from friends kept opening and dumping its contents.  This got to be a real pain.  Tomorrow were going to rig it closed permanently.     I then mowed the front and side lawn.  This takes no time at all on the new zero turn mower.  Nick found himself some dinner while I finished the lawn.  From the front of the house it looks great if I say so myself.  The hedges are trimmed.  The house painters are coming Monday and I wanted to make sure the hedges didn't get in their way.  The hedges got a little butchered, but I think they'll survive.  Had salad and leftover grilled chicken for dinner.  Very tasty.  C called Nick to say good night, but failed to say a single word to me.  I feel very hurt.  I immediately called her back but she wouldn't answer the phone.  So, I left a message that said "You're mean!" and hung up.  Apparently C got the message.  She just called and informed me that she was walking into a store and told Nick that she'd call me later.  I asked Nick and he corroborated her story.  So much for that, C'll call later and we can talk then.  Going to watch TV the rest of the night and go to bed.  Off to church in the morning.  A busy day in the yard with a little movie break.  Till next time...  Kevin

      Nick had his first HS marching band practice last night.  I think he did well from what he said.  I took him out for ice cream after practice as a treat.  We went home and moved the furniture in the family room so the wainscotting can get installed.  The porch looks great.  I talked with C last night and really got pissed off.  I was watching TV when she called so I turned the TV down.  I was having trouble concentrating so I turned the TV off.  I was then accused of being inattentive.  That's bullshit!  I couldn't hear so I turned the TV off.  When I went back to the phone all I got was a pile of shit from C.  Give me a damn break.  I called the house painters to see when they could start.  No date yet.  Still working on getting the floor refinished.  (I can't find anyone who wants to do it)

      I've been unable to work on C's garden due to the weather.  I called the painting people to see if the house could get painted soon.  Maybe the rain is going to take a break.   We'll see...  Yesterday started normally.  Got up, took shower, dressed and off to work at 7:00 a.m.  I'm getting much more comfortable at work these days.  I was able to perform 99% of all requested tasks without asking anyone for help.  This is good since my co-worker was on vacation and I was running solo.  I did have to call her regarding a printer lookup issue, but that was easily resolved.  The printer definition was stored in an unfamiliar location.  The user was happy I got him the information he needed.  I left work early at 1:30 to pick Nick up from the airport.  It took a lot longer to get there from Griffin, GA than it does from home, but the trip was uneventful.  As I pulled into the airport parking lot C called and let me know his flight was delayed and has not taken off yet.  Bummer, what was I going to do for four hours?  I parked the car and went to the Delta information desk to get a security pass so I could meet Nick at the gate.  It was surprisingly easy to get the pass.  I managed to pass through airport security without incident.  I bought a couple magazines and got a beer in the Budweiser lounge.  After about an hour C called and let me know the flight has left the ground.  I proceeded to the gate and waited for the plane to land.  I got an iPod mini and sat and read and listened to my eclectic musical choices:  James Brown, Counting Crows, Trisha Yearwood, etc.  The plane landed around 5:00 p.m.  We walked to the baggage carousel where, thankfully, our luggage was waiting for us.  We picked up Nick's bags and went to the car.  I drove home, but decided to stop and get supper.  We had dinner at Chin Chin's, a Chinese place.  I had Szcheuan Beer and Nick had Terraki Chicken.  Good stuff.  Went to Great Clips to get Nick's hair cut.  Then off to Show Carnival to get Nick some comfortable walking shoes for the band practices all July.  I bought him two pair.  I also make a quick stop into the Matress Factory to get a replacement for the master bedroom.  Our matress is almost 18 years old.  It was time to change it.  Especially given the sinking middle of the matress.  We went home, dropped off the luggage, then off to Publix.  We got Nick some food, cause I don't have anything he'd want to eat.  Since I started this diet, I've been eating salad, cheese, veggies and meat.  This isn't on a teen diet.    Nick played AIM on the computer while I watched a little TV.  Off to bed at 11:00 pm.  This morning I got up, showered, dressed, woke up Nick, and off to work.  Pat is coming to the house today to do some work around the house.  I'm having the front porch refinished, wainscoting in the family room, finish basement ceiling and correct peg board install C and I did.  Also he's going to put in a work bench with MDF top for me.  That'll help with the hobby stuff, I'd like to do.  Make furniture...I'd like to continue a hobby my grandfather W was so much into.  Anyway, as I got about 80% to work, I remembered I forgot my computer.  So back to the house.  Pat was there and had dropped off his stuff and was headed to Lowes to buy the stuff to finish the house.  Good stuff.  I picked up my computer and went to work.  Nick has band practice tonight.  I hope everything goes well for him.  I bought him some compression shorts to help alleviate chaffing during marching practice.  It's a good life so far.  Kevin

      This weekend...  On Friday I got off work early due to the fouth holiday at 2 pm.  That was nice.  I went up to Circuit City and purchased a router for our internet connection.  That way I'll be able to connect my work laptop and home computer at the same time.  It was very easy to setup.  I'll have to admit I was apprehensive.  I then went to play golf with Phil from across the street.  I met him at 5:30 at orchard hills gc.  He paid.  I wasn't expecting him to pay, so I bought him some beer.  After we teed off on the second hole it started raining and thundering.  We had to go back to the club house to wait 30 minutes.  We then resumed our round and were the last to leave the course.  Saturday, I went to see Spiderman.  It was an awesome movie.  It was significantly better than the first one.  Good plot, essentially a love story this time.  I also mowed the lawn with the new grass catcher on the mower.  That seemed to work well and I got it in before it rained.  Sunday, I went to church, took a nap and then worked on C's garden.  As soon as I got setup to start again, it started thundering over my head.  So...I put everything away and took a shower.  By time my shower was done it was sunny again.  So I waited an hour and went back to the garden to clear some weeds and put down the mulch.  I didn't get much done because it was so wet and getting late.  I took another shower and went to bed.  Monday, I played golf with Lee at Cotton Fields.  It was a real nice course.  It was fun and good to see my old work friend.  Monday afternoon, I took a small nap and helped Paige fix her computer internet connections after a recent lightning storm struck her house.  I installed a new NIC card in her computer and configured her wireless router.  We then spent some time talking.  For lunch I had a grilled salmon and vegatable salad with balsamic vinegar dressing.  I need to pay attention to the diet more seriously again.  Anyway, that's my weekend.    Kevin
