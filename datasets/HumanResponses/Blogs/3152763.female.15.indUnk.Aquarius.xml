      Chris is supposed to get back today. After 4. I want to see him. I hope that he would stop by my house after he got back to town  but I know that would be unreasonable. He probably wants to be home with his family. Hell need to unpack and will probably have to do some work that he missed. He only lives 5 minutes away form me. If I hear a door or car I run to my window to see if his car is in the driveway. Its so pathetic. But I guess its ok as long as I know that. Our new snake is really neat I didn't wasn't one ... Car..I resist getting up.......Anyways like having it now. It wraps around my hand and is very little. Hes sheedind skin right now because its all brown and black but when its done it will be a bright red and orange its a corn snake it will eat live mice. I haven't seen it yet but I will soon....Another car.. But no Chris *sigh* yeah again sad.  LOL I use to have this poster that said you haven't grown up until the day you have your first good laughed at yourself. I believe it. I don't know if I wrote it in the last bloc but in February ill be 15. On the 10th.    I recently broke three of my glass bookshelves. They strech across my shortest bedroom wall which is actually quite long. (car) It really is pretty bad cause I have 3 shelves worth of books reamed on all my other shelves. Or in the floor.   Even if he did go home it would be nice if he would get on the internet (AIM ) pretty fast he usually does but he hasn't went out of town but once since we've been together.(car) and IM really anxious because I want to know how everything went. I cant imagine how he feels if I feel this way I miss him... Las Vegas sucks (is this aloud) when you younger I went a good while back and it was just bad I don't know why IM complaining now. IM a really slow typer. Chris types really really fast and makes fun of me.  In the class we had together a paper I typed got erased (when I first met him) and so he typed it for me and he started pecking the keys and it was mean.   Car

      Im so sad. My Chris, boyfriend, is going into the Navy. Tear. He leaves today to go to Houston for a physical and gets back Thursday. Im sad but its ok because its what he really wants to do. Ill miss him. Likeliness hell be gone five months and home six months from what he told me. Sadness. Oh well. My dad got a pet snake. Im going to join the choir at church. ummm.... I met Chris in my comm app class. and he ask me to be his girlfirend Nov. 7, 2003. Its probably Katies ,a friend, fault not that its a bad thing.   But she recongnized it and was all "Go to homecoming, Go to homecoming."(together) So we did. His birthday was January 12. He turned 18. We went to eat at anti pastas and then went to his house (me him Alex)   and had cake and he opened gifts. I got I him the day Vince code but he had it. I knew he did not by seeing it but just a feeling but I got it anyways because everything I saw it I thought of him. If you put our bookshelves side by side the pretty much match. Same stuff.    My friend erica will probably be going to collage in about a year. And then hell leave and ill be all by my lonesome. I love this school and the people in it but I think that there is no where that I fit in. I don't miss central Heights at all. Ill have Leslie and Tyler and Daphne but all my church friends suck now. LOL sadness. Oh well. Yeah sooooooo. I guess im done. till later.

      I walked into the room. It was really plane. White walls and instead of 4 walls there were 3 walls and one was a giant window there was a white couch and in a corner there was a tall white vase with white Lilly were no lights or fans. The room was very peaceful looking. I turned around and took off my shoes. I stepped in again. I headed towards the couch and looked in a mirror on the wall over the couch to make sure my back side was clean and I sat down. In another vase there was bamboo. It wasn't as tough you would get in trouble for getting it dirty but it was too beautiful to do so. It isn't cheerful but not sad either it was releasing and relaxing. It would be the perfect place for writing or art. It was the most plesant place i had ever been.

        My least favorite Greek charater is Hurculese. I just dont like him. Hes relly stupiid. literally. I think it would not matter how strong he was because if he kept doing stupid things and hurting people by it because he is stupid then he would be better off week and stupid or week and strong or smart and strong than stupid and strong. I think he causes more harm than good and i dont just get that from the movie but also but lessly form the book. I just dont like him there isint much more for me to say.

      Greek Society relates to society today because except for them being mega strong and haveing powers people ahve not changed. People are overall still heartless and cruel. they would screw you over in a second and obiviously thats how it use to be to, Because they were always killing someone or stealing sometihng or commiting adultry. And so forth. I use to think that the further we got in the world the worse we are i stil do but if i believed in mythology then i would no longer believe that because they were just as bad if not worse then we are now.

      I havent seen chris in 4 days out of 4 weeks. Im verry agervated and  think i have a reason to be alothogh many people get mad for such small reasons and i dont want to be that kinda person. I hope that my reason is reasonable. I think that others would be agervated but it dosent really matter what others think because they arent in my realationship and alot of people are irrational. I figure that somethins i contradict myself sometimes. Write something somethime and then later say something oppisite. I hope someone besides my teacher reads these (MRS ABT) if not then mmabee there is no reason to do this except fo rthe grade fo course but i think that i will do this after i stp getting grades. If someone dos read this pls let me know so that i cant know if my commint thing works cause it should. sssssoooooo i dont have much else to say......im going to go out to eat tommorow with chris and probably chew him out because we NEVER do anything i dont think our relation shp is goign to last much longer but i want it to          i wont really chew him out.im not that kind of person.

       February 07, 2004 My philosophy of life. I don't really know what it is but I think what I am going to talk about will go with the assignment.  Where I came from.  I don't believe that I evolved from an ape or that there was a little spec of dust that exploded and bam there are the planets. Oh and it just so happens that instead of there being life on all of them its just on the one but still from the same speck of dust. If that were the case then there would be life on all the planets not just one. As for evolving from an ape. Where are all the half apes. They wouldn't just disappear or anything. And being that it would have to occur over a long period of time it would be reasonable for someone to argue that we are all that's left but it would be decimated or we would find proof. I mean we have all this stuff about dinosaurs altogether IM not sure if I believe that they existed either. So we have the skeletons. You know since things can evolve and all maybe we just had some really big big ( I was going to say something else) elephants or something and the scientist but the skeleton together wrong.  I believe the whole bible theory. God made the world in 7 days. And was lonely and made us plus we got to name the animals. Oh yeah buddy. True reason for our being to serve and be with God. And truly that doesn't make sense either. He could make the world and us but where did he come from. Easier said for some then others. He was just there. But every thing ash a beginning and an end. God doesn't? It makes no sense. A couple of days ago in class you said that in some cultures life lines are a straight line and some where circles. Well my life line is neither as well as Gods. Mine is a ray. I was born and that was the starting point ant it will continue forever, weather in heaven or hell. @-----------------------> that's my life line right there. Continues for all eternity. They arrow showing when my time ends on earth. I guess IM saying that if a culture can have a life line that is a circle then why can there not be a God. If someone can die and come back something else ,and I don't believe that's possible either but what the hey, then who is to say god does not exist.     Gods life line will, it will last forever. It will be there when we aren't.    that's gods life line and the closest I can come to find how I define philosophy       1:26 PM Wednesday, January 14, 2004 Im sitting in class waiting for the 12:10 bell to ring. Its 12:05 now. If you get out of class just on time slipping thought the crowed of people in the hall then you might have time to eat your whole meal. 12:07 our lecture finally ends. Three minutes and the blue hall will be filled with people. Three and a half minutes and the commons will be invaded by students pushing and shoving. Slipping through the door pass whoever is checking the ID's today (because they don't have theirs)trying to get in line. The bell rings and just as I described it everything falls into place, everyday it never fails. I hurry to the lunch line and reach in my pocket. I pull out my ID, I remembered it today. Then to decide what you want to eat. I always pick chicken. The wait is long. It seams like the line goes on forever in front of me, I look back and am thankful that I made it so close to the front this time. I step forward. Again and again till I reach the front and pay for my food. I hurry to the lunch table where I now sit with my boyfriend. Everyone is already sitting. No one there eats except me and another girl, I have yet to learn her name. All the others have early release. They sit around ant talk and I listen to them. The words slipping through there lips, I don't catch everything, and never talk. I also watch people as they steal chairs from others as they sit in them. Many people stand. By third lunch I am very hungry and need to check with Mrs. Blunt about the art show. I eat the chicken piece by piece but chew quickly. My jaws move up and down. Teeth grinding against either the meat of themselves. I that's a quick drink of water. The wetness in my mouth is stewing but there is no time to enjoy it. I decide I am finished. And give away about half my lunch, keeping the water. I walk with speed down the hall to room 505. Talk to miss blunt and the bell sounds. I jump at the sharp ring of it still speaks but I have to cut her short being that my class is on the other side of the school. I yet again hurry thought the halls back to my class to make it there within the five minutes that I no longer have. I always make it.

      Hi HI hI hi how are you? Im good. Why not great you ask? Ah well you don't want to hear it. What...? You do......? WELL Ok I guess.  Maybe or not. A lot of times I cant decide. I just hit this mood and well you know.. Or maybe................You don't. Do you? OH YOU DON'T!?!?!? WOW! Well I guess I could explain or maybe not. Although there would be no harm in it. Or would there? NO? YOU DON'T THINK SO? Well I guess..But no.. I mean I could.. But no...I cant ...Well I can.. But mentally there is this little spot in my head that holds me back from talking and telling anything I feel for the fear that I will say something that I will regret later or hurt someone's feelings or embarrass myself or let anyone get a little bit closer. Although you can. Can What you ask. Get closer. I don't open my heart willingly to anyone BUT if you act interested, you could probably dig it out of me. What? How long will it take? Oh WELL it depends on my mood, my anger, my irritability. Huh! You probably think IM crazy. What? You don't? WHY, everyone else does. Wait are you leaving? Yes? But why? But you said you didn't think I was crazy..................................What changed? Oh....I See......Nothing changed......You thought I was crazy all along.

Like when i draw ji can never think about something to draw but if someome suggest something then i have the perfect pic in my head. Some times when i write im not always writeing. i think of things and im all i should rememn\ber this and then i forget and so its pointless. Yesss it is  it is it is . I stilll have nothing to talkk about still need to cleane my room yeha otherwise nothing later

      "i was chewin some watermellon bubble gum yesterday. And you wouldnt believe it unless you had seen it, but while i was chewin my watermellon bubble gum a truck passed by. Now i know your probably thinkin why in the world does it matter if your chewin bubble gum when a truck passed by. Well i know i didnt mention this before but that truck, it was red. AND i was chewin watermellon bubble gum and well watermelons, there red too. It was a sign i was convinced. Now i know that you sayin well I see red trucks everyday but thats you city folks. Yep i only see a truck about once every week when the mail comes and it blue. A red truck is a pretty unusual thing of what you be seein around here. Now i couldnt see the driver but when i was asleep last night i was dreaming that i was chewin some whatermellon bubble gum. and you wouldnt believe it unless you had seen it, but while i was chewin my watermellon bubble gum a truck passed by it was red. and in my dream there was an old man with a beard drivin. He looked like a city folk.  maybe a city country folk cause he had tattoos and wore a black vest, like a motercycle ridin person is what i amagine. a motercycle ridin person is all i could figure him to be. And you know how i know that my dreame was rite. cause he is been sitin right there in that booth at the back of the caffe by that window. And see that is the red truck, that one right behind him, that i saw when i was chewin the watermellon bubble gum and i think i should get a beard like that but then i would look liek a motercycle riden person liek how that guy in the back of the caffe by that window and i dont think id care for that too much." The guy in the back of the caffe by that window got up and walked twords what he thought of as THE LOUD MOUTH.  "I just over hered you and i wanted to let you know that my name is Jed and i have never seen a motercycle in my life. THE LOUD MOUTH grabbed the hand that Jed stuck out. "HI im Jeff and I just figured you did." "Jeff. You obviously know what i drive. What do you drive?" Jeff smiled                  "A motercycle."

"HI im Jeff and I just figured you did." "Jeff. You obviously know what i drive. What do you drive?" Jeff smiled                  "A motercycle."

      Erica and I sit at Java Jacks watching the costumers. 	First to enter after us is a couple. They are obviously on there first date. The guy played with his hands not sure what to do. He acted as if he wanted to grab her hand or put his arm behind her back but if he tried he would jerk back before she noticed. He ordered.         “I want a 16 oz. Mocha coffee and mmm....what would you like?”                   The girl smiled sweetly                                                                                                                              “Oh ya know I kinda don’t drink coffee...Im sorry.”        “ Oh well I... should have......made sure do you wanna go somewhere else? I mean it would be no problem or well they have other stuff like...mmm.....................well Ice cream, or mmm like food food   some at least or a Java shake , well without the Java cause coffee is java   and yeah??? UMM your choice.”          “Umm..... Shake chocolate”she said. And they left.   Erica and I were cracking up. Cheep date.  	Another guy walks in and orders.          “Coffee two sugars, and one cream.”          He looks around as he waits he looks around for somewhere to sit. Someone he knew. He finds noone, and leaves when he gets his order.  Again we laugh. Bluntness.   The third was an old woman. Not very old but she had wrinkles.          “I would like the IRISH CREAM Favored Latte. You see I am for Ireland and It just makes me fill so at home when I have something from home.”  Big grins spread wide across our face.            The next was a young girl. Not young young. About say 15.          “I want well I don’t know. Ummm Maybe a Java shake or well how is the Mango ice tea? wait I don’t like mango. Umm lemon I love lemons how is the lemon ice tea? Oh but wait I hate tea.............ill have ............................................................................... ...................... .................. ..........................................................a............................................................................................................................................................................................java shake. Vanilla.”  I was about to bust. She left and I did and then Erica followed.  Second to last. A teacher. She has papers pilled up to her nose and was peeking over the top of them.          “I want Cappuccino.” her words muffled by her voice. “Umm cant you bring it to me....my money its in tha.....well on the top..yeah get it.  Thanks.”  We cringed when she almost dropped the papers sitting them down.  It was 8:30 and about time to go. Erica pulled out a dollar fifty and handed it to me. I went and ordered a Chocolate Shake. Three dollars even every time. I pay the rest and we leave and don’t ever finish it.

      So here goes another day of blogging. I wish i had something reative to say but i dont. I can come up with creative things and write out things better then to say something to someones face. But i have been running low on the creativeness for llike ever.  Usually when i come up with something creative i am in the shower and dont have enought time to write it down   and if i have the time then i forget most of it. I Guess i could put some of my poems. I think that when ppl write then it is usually pretty good but they automatically say oh its terrible. I knkow i do. I think that my stuff is pretty good thought. well just have to find out. well i am done for now. have to go. logging off really really really soon.                         bye.

      I was sitting in class yesterday listening to a conversation that i had nothing to do with and this girl was talking about sex braclets. Ok can you say insane?the diffreant color jelly braclets. So i got home and looked into it. On the internet. There is a game called SNAP. "One person attempts to break or "snap" a sex bracelet off of another person. The broken bracelet then becomes a "sex coupon" that the snapper can exchange for the sex act signified by the bracelet's color. It is cheating if you simply pull the bracelet off the arm without breaking it, or use a knife or scissors to cut it. The game is rumored to have first been played at college fraternity parties." The meaninggs of the diffrent colors. "Black: sexual intercourse  Blue: blow job (alternate meaning: lap dance)  Green: cunnilingus  (alternate meaning: outdoor sex, hug)  Clear: whatever you want  (alternate meaning: hug)  Orange: kiss  Yellow: hug (alternate meaning: analingus)  Red: lap dance (alternate meaning: French kiss, oral sex)  Purple: anal sex  (alternate meaning: holding hands, doggy style)  Silver: fisting  White: flash your tits (alternate meaning: gay kiss, French kiss)  Pink: flashing  Gold glitter: make out  Brown: toss my salad, i.e., analingus  Glow in the dark: using sex toys, e.g. vibrators, dildos, etc. " Its sadning. From what ive seen nothign has come of  it but in some schools they have had them baned. Although it could just be the idea. But i think tah it is really sad that sex is know as it is as such a young age.(some websites i looked at called it a media myth) Its supposed to be something really special between two married adults and this takes away what is specail about it. The fact that its with one person whom you truly love. this is not the only thing taht does this but it did really catch my attention. its even been noticed as recognized by 3rd graders suposadly. How the youth today is so ammune to seeing a sex scene in a movie  compared to are parents and there parents who would never have seen it on TV because it was not aloud. eyah anyways its stupid. There bracelets!!! People need to grow up just a bit.

      I think i need to start makeing some real friends. I know I have friends. But you know how you see a  group of ppl who are inceparable. I have one friend like that but it would be nice for a couple more. Kelsey is pretty nifty. Shes crazy in a not bad way. but i dont thinki she looks at me like a friend outside of school way. mainly becausse we are not friends outside of school except over the internet when she gets online.im really happy to have met her thought. It saddens me that she wants to graduate early. she could do it. exspecially since she has her mind set to it. i think my worst habbet is not trying to get to know ppl better.  Its alot diffrent  being at a new school and not knowing everone. I hate CHS though. I had friends there and still do go out with them and stuff but they were all so inmature. and still are. except for my chs crew noone kept in touch. Because im not immature and dont goof around like they do.  My moter use to tell me that i didnt have any friends and one tiem she said did you get an invite to soinsos birthday. She was and is a compleate Bitch. Soinso haddent handed out the invites yet. She always did stuff like that at the school. aLot. She pulled me out of class a while back.   a couple of years ago and compleatly chewed me out over something stupid. She wored there. That was when i decided to change schools. Of choures i did adn she "QUIT". Personally i think She got fired. SHe was and again is physco. she has told me she had quit alot of jobs since then but ive heard from reliable sources that she was fired. Mainly for stealing things like at belks I hope nothing she has got for me was stolen. I would hate that. i mean eah that would just suck. but yeah anywho. Im really glad i moved schools. I realized that larger schools are way better. in smaller schools its so small that all pple can do it stay in otheres businessand tell lies ans so f .forth . (make fun of ppl) Since i have caome to this school i ahve not had one negitive commint made twords me. Its nuce and ppl act like they care other thatn to have there noses in it. Yeah i dont knwo if im done with that subject but ill say i am just to move on. Maybe.   well if you were watching me type this you would have realized a long pause. I have nothing right now but maybee later.    well later then.

      another boreing day in the life of me. you know how it goes. get up. eat. goto school. skip lunch. come home. get on the net. go to sleep. and it starts all over again the next morning. well it is another boreing day in the life of me except less boreing. and less me. i woke up this morning and insted of eating i went out side. i walked down the street for no reason at all that i knew of. So. as i was walking down the road a grey van pulled up beside me. a man in a black suite and a red tie grabed me and pulled me in. the van smelled of insences.  Blossom. and was very bright on the inside. like in the movie austin powers. there was a little boston terrier sitting on my feet. he was fat. i felt like laughting at this fat dog but thought shouldnt i be scared. i wasnt. It was humerious adn cheerfull therefor i was not frightened. The man in the suite turned to me." I am Felix. Felix Sway. I am an Van Gogh inpersonator and i need your help. I here you can paint." i shook my head in a yes motion. "but not van gogh. " i looked at him questionably. "you know"he said," any other kid would be screaming about haveing to get to school right now." "you couldnt ahve kidnaped that many kids then cause i dont know a one that woukkld ask for you to take them to school. " "whatever" he walked off. .....................to be continued...

      Oh my goodness. can you say pain. i went to the american cancer society walk for life and walked from 6 till 6 in sets of 2s or 4s depending on who i was with. it hurts to breath deeply i am so out of shape so this was good for me. i ended up walking over 10 miles. and didnt sleep at all i came home adn sleep from 8 ta 2 adn my muscles hurt. but im not ht eonly one so its all good. Erica and i were leaving so she could run to her house and get some medicine and there were 4 old ladies outside the gate wearing survivior sashes adn they were smokeing. it was terrible.adn i had started to wonder what the point was. I could see if someone was paying so much for ever mile or something like that but we were all walking for no reason. Also they were haveing a blood drive which i thoutt was kinda commical because usually when you donate blood thay have you wait a while or you have soemone with you to drive you home becaude some people get all dizzy. at least that is what i thought could easily be wrong since i haveent been to one. But were all walking and they would draw blood and o could just see a whole bunch of ppl passing out on the track after it nad then haveing to go to the hospital and then they get blood maybee and altought its not th e same blood it would still hve made it pointless. Oh i feel so bad for michael.they lost what would have been the 2nd to last game they would paly by one point in overtime from what i hear they were doing verry poorly at the beginning and in the last 10 min. started playing like themselves. but he still has 2 years to go to state, that is his goal. i think thast there is a ring they get once they go that he wants because he was talking once and was all the only ring i am ever going to wear i sth e on e i get hwen we win state....... ok sleep is sounding good now later

      i like science fiction because it goes boyond reality. It makes things that arent possible happen. I think that alot of things in science fiction are probably going to come true aventually. I think most of it that i read is looking into the feature.i thinik taht a lot of  the things today could have possibly been created in books and then people decided to make them real. And i think that it will continue that way. Not all of them are about the feature, i realize. Those i think just give you some way to open up your mind and see things you usually would not. But i have to go later.

Yeha dark brown i hope.  maybee i dont know i think i cant remember. I think mrs. montie is mad at me.

Its nto that i dont liek her its just she came and tried to be everyones friend and now she trying to be all searious and well its hard to take her searious. expecially when things dont make sence. liek how we are to waste time on SKILLS cds it sucked no offence. but its all good. i think that if she had came and was searious when she had came it would be better. ok well laterness i suppose fodr now i realize tha tthis is a good way to waste time like kelsey sadi after david. ok byye

      Czech Republic 	The items that impacted my budget most has to do with travel. Flying to Czech Republic and back home to Houston would cost me 1,185 dollars and once I got to Prague it would cost me 300 Euro to rent a car for the five days I would spend there.  	I choose my attractions by interest 	To travel to Prague, Czech Republic from Houston it cost me 1,183 dollars. Once I got here I spent 314 Euro to rent a compact car for five days. I spent Ten dollars and seventy-five cents on a reference dictionary for translating their language. For attractions I spent all together sixteen and five Euro (I don’t know how to read their money). My hotel with free breakfast (probably paid for in price for hotel) cost me 300 euro. The total cost for my meals was 172.5 Euro. I spent 175 dollars on souvenirs for my dad, mother, Granny Iva, Nana, Doggy Oggy, Erica, and Me! Plus an extra fifteen dollars a day turns up to be seventy-five. If you leave the Euros, Euros and turned the dollars into Euros then I would have spent 2900.68 Euros. Turn that into dollars and its 3563.49 dollars which means I have 2436.51 dollars left. I have enough money to replace my computer, or maybe ill get a digital paint set.     	4/25/04 	Today I packed my things to leave for a five day trip to Czech Republic. In my suitcase you will find. A lot of warm clothes. Jeans, long sleeve shirts, tons of socks, underclothing, tennis shoes, Tylenol, tooth paste and brush, hair brush, shampoo, deodorant, and my fuzzy blanket. I started packing early so I could make it to the airport on time. My friend, Erica, and my dad drove me to Houston. We made it there just in time for me to put on my luggage and get on the plane at 5:40 p.m. they served us supper and I slept a good was their as well as read. The flight landed at 10:25 a.m. and I got my luggage and went and picked up my car which I could have gotten at 9 a.m. if I had been there. I put my stuff into my compact car and drove to my hotel. There I checked in and went to my room. I settled in. I decided to set out for lunch and found the most pleasant restraunt. I went back to the hotel and rested for a little while and realized that out the widow there was the most magnificent view of the city. I took a shower and changed into some nicer clothes. Went to eat again and then went to a Black Light Theater.  I got back to the hotel room at about 10 or 10:30 and went to sleep. Overall today went quite well. I was amazed at the city and the beauty of the architecture but the Black Light Theater was not all that I had hoped.              Oh by the way, I traveled eleven hours and forty-five minuets in air not to mention after that. WOW! 	 	4/26/04 	Today I am to travel to Plzen. Its about a thirty minuet drive. I have already ate my breakfast and am about to get on the road. I should get there in time to do some shopping before lunch.  I figure ill get something for my dad, Doggy Oggy , Granny Iva, Erica, and Mother. That’s about one hundred dollars. After shopping ill get lunch and then go to the Monastery. I’ve heard about them and always thought it sounded neat so I am going to see one today. I amagine that I will be there a good deal of the day. Ill drive another probably thirty-five minuets(longer since its dark). I will get back to the hotel about eight thirty, took a shower and went to bed.  	Did I mention that it has been raining for the past two days. Grrrrr.... Yeah. Bummer.  	 	4/27/04 	Alright. The third day here and its still poring rain(reason for tons of socks). I skipped breakfast and left the hotel early because the weather and the drive which was an hour and thirty minuets. I am going to Brno today. Here there is some kind of cemetery that for some reason is special (Honestly, I just went for the name. Brno. Its great. That is what im going to name my next dog). Any ways, ten bucks to go see a cemetery! Can you say crazy! I can, and I have a friend who can say it in thirteen different languages. Five are computer languages. It wasn’t so bad thought. Its not like I’ve spent tons of money anywhere else. So yeah after the Cemetery my feet were soaking wet. That’s why I brought three extra pair of socks. And people call women crazy for over packing. I had an umbrella I bought after I got there so the rest of me was pretty dry. So yeah I went and ate lunch and then went shopping. I got something for my Nana. Also I remembered I had not gotten myself anything, therefor I did. I drove back to the hotel yet again, and fell to bed with no shower completely exhausted.   	4/28/04 	Today is the last day I will get to do anything. I wake up and cant remember anything past when I walked into the hotel lobby. I took a cold shower to get myself fully functional and went downstairs to have breakfast. Still not fully awake I go upstairs and back to bed. I wake up at noon and go out for lunch after fixing my hair. Then I make my way to The Museum of Decorative Arts.  I honestly cant say why I choose here except.........well it might have had something to do with that really hot guy in my English class who came here last year and suggested it. But really you never know. I spent hours here, until supper at least and went to eat yet again. Then I decided standing in one of the rooms there that I would go out and drive around the town if the weather cleared up( the hot guy said it was the best part). And ya know you wont believe it but I got to go. It was the nicest evening I had there and the building were beautiful. I don’t know if I would go back but im certainly glad I went.  	4/29/04 	So today is my last day here. I eat breakfast at the hotel, pack my bags, and go to the airport. I get on the plane and sit there for thirteen hours and twenty-five minuets, plus the three hour drive home. I dread it. I mean I love to travel but this is just to much. I figured it out on the plane and I will be coming home with 2,436.51 dollars left. I could buy a computer, except I have one already. I finished reading the book that I started at the beginning of the trip.   	4/30/04 	Alright. So I know your saying, hey that was five days but part of the journey of any trip is homecoming. And seeing that I got back yesterday at 1:40 in the evening and sleep. I met up with everyone today and told them how it went. I gave everyone their gifts I brought back ( the real adventure is seeing if I can make it thought my Nana reunion even though I don’t see her much anyways. She tells me about her traveling experiences that I have heard about a trillion times. I struggle to get away and finally do with the excuse that erica is coming over. I call her and she does. So good to be home, and to sleep on my own couch( I have no clue why I do this. I have a bed and a futon and I sleep on the couch). Well that was my trip. It was fun, but im glad its over. Ill finish unpacking in about a month and then have to go somewhere else. Oh well. Latterness.
