						   People love to read about people. So, I'm putting up a posting to describe me somewhat. This is from my personal prospective so don't expect much.  I grew up in an average size town of Newark, Ohio. It was there that my parents raised my right. I played soccer, tennis, and even basketball. Then I grew up went to Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio where I got a degree in Religion and most importantly, met Brittany, my wife! I am now 23 years old and am moving to Louisville, KY to attend Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Ok, I think that is enough of my life...read more if you want to know my testimony. I don't want to type a new one so I'm copying my testimony letter that I gave to Southern.  The Testimony...   “My soul will make its boast in the LORD; the humble will hear it and rejoice.”    Psalm 34:2  I never understood nor did I feel the weight of my sin when I was growing up.  The Catholic Church trained my heart to be content with a spiritual life that only included attending church and being a good person, while my parents surrounded both my brother and I with the institution.  This continued throughout my childhood until my mother made a bold move; she bought protestant Bibles for the youth of our church.  This threw the leadership into an outrage that led to our family’s dismissal from the church.  Meanwhile, my life as a teenager was carefree.  I did not care for spiritual things but for things of this world.  Music was my life and I would devote hours to playing guitar, drums, piano, and anything else I could get my hands on.  My dreams consisted of becoming a famous rock star, traveling the world and generally living life in a godless manner.    For the time being, my family thought it best to attend a Southern Baptist Church down the road from our former Catholic one in order to fulfill our religious duty.  As we attended the regular service, my parents forced me to go to the youth group, which was about to embark on its annual summer retreat.  Fighting my parents tooth and nail, I got on the bus and headed to North Carolina with 50 other kids, only one of which I knew. My heart was offensively hard toward God and what I truly desired was to be with my real friends at home.  God met me in an overwhelming way at this retreat.  The whole week my heart was not interested in listening to the messages or participating in Bible study activities. Yet on the last night there, my ears perked in response to a testimony the minister of music gave.  His was much like mine, and at that point, my stone heart became thirsty and I knew that I was a wretched man who urgently needed saved from my sin. In June of 1995, Jesus Christ saved me from my terrible fate and I started my spiritual pilgrimage.    My journey has been incredibly difficult and has lead me to humbling places as well as spiritual mountaintops.  I constantly call to mind Lamentations 3:27 which says “It is good for a man that he should bear the yoke in his youth. “  When I was thirteen my mother was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and terrible kidney problems.  My family was in and out of the hospital with her and this misfortune drove us to deep searching with God.  In addition to this struggle, we encountered constant harassment in our neighborhood because my parents had adopted my brother, who was biracial. I learned greatly from these trials of dealing with the sorrow of a horrific disease and the racism that raged even in our middle-class suburb.  Yet, like Christian from Pilgrim’s Progress, my family and I pressed on to take part in what is still yet to come: Zion.  Other difficulties stemmed from outside my family.  After becoming a Christian, I began to date a girl who brought a life-changing burden to me.  She was diagnosed with bulimia and was involved in major spiritual combat.  I desperately desired to help her and bear this burden that was not mine to bear.  Yet, there came a time when her troubles became too burdensome and we had to part ways. As we were ending our relationship, she attempted suicide in front of my eyes.  It was at this point that God awakened my lukewarm heart and set my eyes on things above.  Thus began my journey in understanding God in scripture and in his plan for me.  Because of the yoke I bore in my youth, I had many questions concerning the character of God and decided to get involved in Campus Crusade for Christ my freshman year of college.  After my first week of school, I began to lead music at the weekly meetings and I got involved in Bible studies and discipleship.  While in Crusade, I learned invaluable skills pertaining to leadership, evangelism, discipleship, and other countless aspects of the Christian life.  God taught me a great deal from his Word and from the leadership positions I was in.   During my involvement with Campus Crusade, I was able to spend a summer in the inner city of Chicago.  There, I worked with kids in the projects and was able to visit and encourage the homeless.  Along with that, I was blessed to lead the project as the student director, guiding a group of 35 student peers for the summer.  My time in Chicago gave me a wonderful heart for racial unity and for the poor.  Because my mother was a social worker and my brother was biracial, my heart was set on making a difference in those specific areas already, but immersing myself in the cultures of Chicago for three months greatly increased my passion for them.   Two years after my summer project, I became student president of Campus Crusade.  In that position, I was able to lead our movement to become a God-centered body that would stand on God’s infallible Word.  It was that year that God called me into the ministry and I was quite eager to see how God would use me to minister.  As the student president of Campus Crusade and other shepherding positions, God showed me a deep need for faithfulness to the Word, authenticity, and passion in the church.  Just as Christ gave Himself up for His bride, so I give myself to the church and the unregenerate, all for the glory of God.

						   Well, I've finally broken into the world of blogging! So you may ask? 'What are you going to do with this now?' I desire to use this as a means to post stuff I've written such as poetry, thoughts, and of course theological proses. I'd love feedback and can handle tough criticism, just don't be a jerk.   I also want to post articles that I think are interesting and thoughtful. I love to read so you will find a variety of articles on different topics.   Thanks for visiting and be sure to come back as much as you can to see what’s going on in Nye land!

						      Hey, it's Brittany again.  I want to share a quote with you from the book I'm reading, "Men and Women: Equal Yet Different" by Alexander Strauch.  There are several reasons I think this book is awesome, but here is one quote that exposes one reason I enjoy it.  "Christian women are to master Christian doctrine, be ready to answer anyone who asks about their faith (1 Peter 3:15), and, like Mary, sit at Jesus' feet to learn (Luke 10:38-42)."     Many times I feel that Christian women, including myself, are more concerned with being LIBERATED (in the evangelical feminist sense) than being BIBLICAL.  We claw and fight what the Bible has to say about women's roles in passages like Ephesians 5 and 1 Timothy 2 instead of taking what they say to heart and sitting at Jesus' feet to learn what the passages really mean.  If the Word says women shouldn't be pastors or elders, and that the husband is the head of the wife, that's what it says, and we (men and women) need to search the Word and the heart of God to see what that means and how to live that out.  We are to MASTER Christian doctrine.  All of us.        One thing I grew up with and continued to believe in college was that the passages in the Bible concerning gender roles, males and females, held no ground today.  If women didn't preach then, it was just how the culture was, people think.  Or if Jesus didn't have female disciples, it was just because of culture.  Cello! :) Jesus broke all kinds of other cultural roles.  He operated within a culture, but He understood God's roles for men and women and that they are specifically appointed and woven in the pattern of God's perfect plan.  Jesus would have broken a cultural barrier such as having female leaders, like elders, in the church if He needed to make a point.  He was not controlled by cultural boundaries, and always listened to God's word over man's word.       Anyway, that's a little nugget of what I've been learning.    I hope some Christian women out there respond to my complementarian view and let me know what you think.  I still have a lot to learn about this!  But I've found true liberation studying biblical femininity- no pure liberty can be found apart from Christ!

						   It may seem superficial to write about my job but I feel I must in order to give a good laugh and to let you in on my thinking...  Basically I walk around Dayton (into people's backyards, basements, and all sorts of weird places) to read electric meters. Many of you might say, "awe sweet, you get to be outside, get good exercise, and  it's different everyday." Some other of you may say, "that sounds scary, what about dogs or other crazy things?"   Well, they would be valid because both occur frequently and both are absolutely crazy. Let me paint for you a picture of some awesome stories...  It was my third of fourth day out on the job when I see a note on my screen... 'XD...or XPIG' taking a second glance I wondered if that meant, 'watchout for pig.' Low and behold, a 300 lb. pig lay sleeping just feet away from the meter. I whistle and holler- no answer. Then I figure I can sneak up to the meter and read it and scoot out of there. I did...the pig didn't wake but man, that was scary.  The next day... I'm out walking in fenceless yards which make things go 3x faster and out of no where this dog lunges out of the bushes to bite my thumb and eat my arm. Fortunately, I swung at him like I have killer bees on me and he started to eat my datacap (or the little computer I have to enter meter numbers). The owner comes out and tells sweet little (100 lb mutt of some sort) that he won't hurt anyone and she is just dogsitting for her son. She pulls the dog away and into the house. My adrenaline was racing! And the dog was inside.  Moreover, my experience with DP&L has been crazy, scary and awesome. I think everyone should do it sometime! Also, if you have a dog, don't ever tell a meter reader or anyone else that little fluffy won't bite. I've heard it before and will never believe you! Neither will other meter readers.  Stay tuned soon...I'm going to get a picture. Check this one out for now!    urlLink How to Avoid a Dog Attack   urlLink Meter Reader hurt by four pit bulls

						   Well, after a good time of prayer and thinking we decided to put an offer on a house. (well, not a REAL offer, just that we like it and may go ahead with it, God willing) It's a three bedroom with a half acre lot...actually just go look at it in 7.10.04 blog above.  We will hopefully get it at a cheap price, lord willing. I've included a sweet quote by C.S. Lewis from his sermon,  The Weight Of Glory .   "If our religion is something objective, then we must never avert our eyes from those elements in it which seem puzzling or repellent; for it will be precisely the puzzling or the repellent which conceals what we do not yet know and need to know."  Currently I'm reading a book called,  urlLink The Rare Jewel of Christian Contentment . It is an awesome book that has convicted me so much.   Philippians 4:11&12 states,  "Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need."  The book is an exegesis on that passage. Oh how I wish I was more content with my situation.   Brittany  is almost finished with a book called,  urlLink Equal Yet Different  which she states is really sweet. I've read some of it and liked what I read. Well, I'm off to go read. Please pray for that house and money! Much love...

						       But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.         Acts 20:24             There is an American way that has caught us in a dangerous trap. We are told that we must have success to be worth something, whether it be financial or social. As a young person getting out of college I’m supposed to get out and live the American Dream. What does that look like? John Piper in his book, “Don’t Waste Your Life” uses an illustration from Readers Digest.    Let me read it to you…pg. 45, 46               This is our American dream: retire early, live easy, and waste everything we were put on this earth to do. We are ‘successful’ when we are able to travel to-and-fro with our camper, our 30-foot trawler and die on the golf course. I’ve read stories exactly like these in all kinds of magazines. Sit in a doctor’s office for a while and you’ll find them in all the magazines. Why are we so hooked on hearing stories of man-centered success? Our culture is gearing us, especially you older people, to get as much as you can now, because life is short! But just like the apostle Paul and John Piper, I plead with you to not buy into this dream.      Paul stated, ‘I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself’ which is the complete opposite of what our culture is told to go for. King Solomon saw this very thing in his day, which prompted him to state, “There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.     13   Even in laughter the heart may ache, and the end of joy may be grief.”    Proverbs 14:12, 13. His wisdom is unprecedented. He knows that the ‘American Dream’ seems right but it leads to death.      Success, retirement, riches, fame. Is it worth it? Or is finishing your ministry and receiving Christ?        We have to fight the battle for life!         Four points are useful for fighting to make the most of our fleeting lives. Two of them challenge our thinking and two of them are practical.          How do we make the most of our fleeting lives?                1.)            Being satisfied in who Christ is completely.    It isn’t about duty to God; it’s about my happiness!            A huge misconception with Christianity is that serving God is our so-called duty. On the surface level this is right, but serving God out of duty rather than out of delight is treachery to God. Christians get burnt out so easily or walk out on the faith because they don’t put their efforts into being satisfied in God. We must delight ourselves in everything that Christ IS as well as our service to him. In my favorite sermon titled “The Weight of Glory” by C.S. Lewis, he explains the need to be pleased in the nature of God….he states,  “If we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards promised in the Gospels, it would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak. We are halfhearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition, when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased."            This point is built into our interactions with people everyday. If one of the members of the church comes to me after playing a song that moved them, and they thanked me for being here and working hard on the music and then I turn and say, “it was my duty, I had to do this.” You would think I was a fraud and wouldn’t really want me to be here. But if I say that it was my pleasure, that person is even more edified that I came to sing.       You see, God is not to be served as though he needed you (according to Acts 17:25), he is to be served because you enjoy and love to.       So, understanding that our service in Christ is a delight or a pleasure and not mere duty, can help us to press hard to ‘ finish our course and the ministry that we received from the Lord Jesus.”          2.)   Read about people that fought before us in Christian Biographies.          Hebrews 13:7 states,   “ Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith.”        One of my favorite kinds of books to read are biographies. It’s so neat to see how people lived out the smallest details of their life. I’ve read many biographies from the great writers and poets of the beat generation like Jack Kaeroak, to one of the powerful preachers of the Great Awakening, John Wesley. All of them wrap me into their lives and I learn so much.        -    I learned from Augustine of Hippo that I must not rail against God for evil. He has helped me understand theodicy (the problem of evil) more than anyone.       -    I learned from Jonathan Edwards life (1703-1755) that sticking to the truth in church matters is more important than I think. He taught me to enjoy God for who he is no matter how much the world is against you.       -    I learned from C.S. Lewis how to strive hard to be fruitful in life. He encouraged laboring to learn Greek to read Greek poetry. He himself learned Icelandic so that he could translate and be satisfied from their poetry.        -    I learned from John Perkins, who taught me so much about racial harmony and city life. Along with my parents he instilled dreams of adopting children and building a racially diverse church.       These people are just tastes of what you can learn. You will be encouraged, uplifted, and spurred on when you read of the great saints that went before us.       3.)   Location, Location, Location.         My wife Brittany and I have spent the last several months looking for a house in   Louisville ,   Ky.   You hear it everywhere that location is everything. You will never be able to sell a house or gain property value if you live in a bad neighborhood that is full of crime and poverty. But, I want to urge you to consider your location.        Brittany and I struggled with where we wanted to live mainly because we want to change neighborhoods and live with the very people we ministered too. Our dream is to buy a house in a neighborhood that we are told to run from. We don’t want to run from neighborhoods that have crime; we want to change them.       Sounds crazy, I know? But allow me to share a few stories of men and women that encouraged me to live like this. I spent a summer in the inner-city   Chicago  . Living in the South Side (which is reputable for crime) and ministering in the famous city projects of Cabreenie Green. I saw fights, drug trafficking, racism, and hate all over the place. But one family who mentored me while I was there lived right there in the middle of all this. People thought they were crazy to move into the South side to be a light in the city. “Wouldn’t it be easier to commute from the suburbs!” people urged them. But what I saw was so exciting. Their neighborhood radically different then those around them. Grass was cut at all houses, houses were in better shape. Why? It was because the Henkles moved in and built into their community. They teamed up with others to make their community better. They changed the community from the inside out. One women, who was a prostitute and a drug addict came to them for help. After a while, she became a Christian, bought an entire block that housed drug dealers she dealt with and turned the houses into daycares for children. I’ve stayed in that day care, I’ve stayed these neighborhoods and it I know that it really works.       Instantly you might think, “Someone needs to live in the safe suburbs to minister to these people.” I think you are completely right in saying that, but there are enough of us in the suburbs!       Want to do something radical for God? Move to the inner-city or another “undesirable” place and fight for your ministry!          3.)                       Making much of Christ from 9 to 5.            "I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one. "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.” John 17:15, 1 6        Don’t get me wrong, not everyone is called to be in some foreign country preaching to the unreached. I would love to see more and more people (especially from Aley) risking their lives to reach the perishing, but as John Piper states, “having a secular job is not bad, but strategic.”        You are in a place where you can relate to people, worship him with your work, and show Christ’s all-satisfying joy that God gives. This is a strategic place because you are constantly surrounded by co-workers that need Christ just as much as the Africans in the jungle, or the Hindu’s in   India   need him.        So, what must you do?        This point brings all the other points together. If you labor to be satisfied in God, if you walk in the Biblical path that others have laid before you, and if you live in such a way that people just have to ask you    “what makes you so happy?” you will see your time from 9 to 5 will be surrounded by awesome fruit. Co-workers will notice that you aren’t the regular kind of Christian but the radical kind. You don’t just talk the talk, but you walk the walk. I find that the biggest stumbling block for the people we minister to (in the workplace or in the hood) is that we talk too much. All Christians want is money and to condemn you. But what they need is for you to a part of them. Involved in their lives outside of work. Offering to take them for lunch, baby-sit their kids free so they can have a date, or have them over for dinner.        If you do these things your 9 to 5 you will find that you are more satisfied in God but that they want to know about the God we serve, Jesus Christ. Work is fleeting, make the most of your time in the office!    Remember, it’s strategic.       To close I want to read 4 resolutions that Jonathan Edwards wrote. I think we can learn from these and it may be good to even write some of our own.       Resolutions by Jonathan Edwards:        -         Resolution #5: “Resolved, never to lose one moment of time but improve it the most profitable way I possibly can.        -         Resolution #6: “Resolved, to live with all my might, while I do live.”        -          Resolution #17: “Resolved, that I will live so, as I shall wish I had done when I come to die.”        -          Resolution #22: “Resolved, to endeavor to obtain for myself as much happiness, in the other world, as I possibly can, with all my vigor, and vehemence, yea violence, I am capable of, or can bring myself to exert, in any way that can be thought of.”        If you feel at all challenged by this, let me encourage you to act. Prayer is essential in making the right steps! You can do all of these things and without a life of prayer it will fail. One of the scariest things about speaking on this subject is that me and my family would not live it out. So please, as you pray for God’s leading in how you can make the most of your life, pray for me, that I would be a doer of God’s Word. Amen

						    By R. C. Sproul Jr.   We've all heard the horror stories. First there was the church that offered visitors a free oil change during the "service" if you would come. Then we heard of simple cash rewards. More recently a church raffled off a new Harley Davidson motorcycle. You couldn't buy raffle tickets; you could only earn them either by visiting or bringing visitors in. Tetzel is spinning in his grave, but only because he is appalled that he never got this sophisticated.  We have our standard ways of measuring the worldliness of the church. We can note that the divorce rate within the evangelical church is roughly equal to the rate among the lost. In one mammoth evangelical denomination, the rate is actually higher. We can look at it ideologically and note that over half those polled who consider themselves evangelical also affirm that there is no such thing as objective truth. Or, we can see the fruit of that affirmation.  In a time of philosophical crisis in ancient Greece, when two competing schools of thought found themselves in a Mexican standoff, a new school arose. The Sophists did not take a side in the titanic struggle between Heraclitus and Parmenides, between the many and the one. Instead they argued that arguing was a waste of time. This school was interested in persuasion, not proof. In fact, like modern relativists, they believed that proof was impossible.  In the modern, or perhaps post-modern West, we are sophists once again. We have added this Western twist--pragmatism. Now persuasion is no longer in the pursuit of rhetorical laurels, but is in the service of selling things. Indeed we live in such a sophisticated age that we are told that the key to success is selling even ourselves. And once again the church has fallen prey to the wisdom of the world. We think that our pathway to success lies in selling ourselves, in presenting ourselves not just as a product, but as a superior product. What was once the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church has become now Oakmont Family Worship Center. The trouble is that there are no oaks, no mountains, few families (that is, the families all split and go their separate ways as soon as they enter), no worship, and precious little center.  What Oakmont Family Worship Center offers instead is a series of bullet-point benefits that fit the demographics of the area. They have a gym, a wide array of twelve-step programs, youth groups, women's groups, men's groups, singles' groups, and of course, their own coffee bar right in the narthex, I mean, the "greeting center." Which in turn means that not only are there no oaks, mountains, families, worship or center, but neither is it one, holy catholic, and apostolic.  It is not one because, unlike the true church, its being isn't centered on the work of Christ. It spits on the liturgy, on the music, even on the convictions of our fathers. It is the first church of what's happening now, and thus is untethered from the church in history.  Neither, of course, is the church holy. It not only is not set apart, but labors diligently to mimic the world. It is unholy on purpose, because its reason for being is pleasing the lost, rather than the One who finds the lost. It moves from embracing the wisdom of this world in embracing a sophist agenda, which, in turn, leads it into embracing the wisdom of the world, because that's what attracts the world. The church begins with the assumption that it can be whatever it wishes and concludes by wishing to be just like the world.  The prototypical Oakmont is not catholic either. Not only does it begin with a marketing strategy, but that marketing strategy is to reach a particular niche (virtually always yuppies, not coincidentally). "Oakmont" is focused on bringing in upwardly mobile professionals. Its vision of the church extends only as broadly as the demographic it is seeking. When we affirm the catholicity of the church we are not only affirming that the church encompasses every tongue and tribe, but that it unites every tongue and tribe. And, as noted above, it transcends time, uniting this century and the last, and the one before that, all the way back to the Garden.  Worst of all, Oakmont is not apostolic. It rejects not only the faith once delivered unto the saints, but likewise it rejects the messengers who delivered that faith. It takes its cues from modern-day church growth gurus, who, in turn, take their cues from the madmen of Madison Avenue. Oakmont isn't concerned with what the apostles said because they make their decisions based on what the market says. And one thing the market cannot bear is sound, old, demanding doctrine. When demographics divide, that's good marketing. But when doctrine divides, that's bad marketing.  Sophistry in the church, then, not only guts the church of her defining marks but gives her a new identity. Now she is no longer the bride of Christ, but a painted lady. When the church hustles the world, it becomes a worldly hustler. In short, like Israel before her, when the church cavorts with the world, she finds her lamp stand removed, she finds herself divorced and alone. The world is a cruel lover, but more important, God is a jealous God. When the church plays to consumers, she will find herself consumed by the One who is a consuming fire. Praise God, however, that the church itself, the true church, will never fall. For her Groom has promised, despite her wandering eye, to remove every blot and blemish. And all His promises are yea and amen.  Tabletalk, June 2004, Ligonier Ministries, p. 60-61    urlLink source

						   Today the official  urlLink 9-11 Commission  report came out. Chair of the commission,  urlLink Thomas H. Kean  stated in his speech that no one is to blame for the attacks on September 11th. [Kean is a liberal himself, although labeled a Republican]. Interestingly enough, his vice chair,  urlLink Lee H. Hamilton  is a democrat. I think this is good to show that it is not about who is right and who is to blame, it is about the truth. Maybe this does not convince you enough because it is not painted in a documentary and spread throughout the country like Michael Moore's Movie? (may I add...I have heard that since the movie has come out more people feel that they feel safer with Bush in office.)  On another note: Kean also went on saying that the U.S. is safer now then it was before 9-11. But he followed that statement by saying that we are still not safe. Terrorism has been spawned by a group of individual and their ideology has spread which means it is not a matter of hunting down Saddam or mainly Osama Bin Laden to take care of the problem it is a whole sect of society that wants to attack the vulnerable US. Political plights such as Michael Moores documentary Fahrenheit 9-11 points to Bush as the cause of 9-11. It seems that Moore was wrong.   But what do I know...I'm just a doofy 23 year old who will not believe everything that the media, Kerry, or Michael Moore says.

						   Tonight, Brittany and I packed up our books. It seems easy enough, but it felt like I was cadging what is meant to be free. I reference bunches of my books almost daily and for them to be neatly packed away in their boxes seems like child abuse or something. I don't worship the books or anything...but the wisdom in some of them! Ah, I miss them already. Don't get me wrong, my departure from them would be totally sweet if I was selling them to be a missionary, but to just box them for moving is rough.   I stumbled upon a book by Voltaire. Brittany had to read it for a literature class, and I thought..."hey, maybe I'll read this 'Voltaire' heathen and write paper on him." probably not considering that's a lot of work to do just before starting Seminary.  In another note, I was able to see an old friend of mine today (Robert Sagar.) It was nice to cetch up and hear about what he is learning. It got me thinking. He is studying the Sabbath and asking, 'how important is the sabbath today? or Should it be followed the same at OT times.' So, here is a book review on  The Sabbath  by A.J. Heschel.  Abraham Joshua Heschel, coined a great deal on the whole idea of what the Sabbath day looks like to those of the Jewish life.  Heschel himself was a mastermind of theology, using beauty and creativity to express these Jewish principles.  In his book The Sabbath, a lay out is presented about the day in which Jews rested.  To Heschel it was more then just rest.  He constructs the beauty behind the day, convincing developments in why it is important to all, and what guidelines are incorporate.  Throughout the book you are tied into looking at the Sabbath day with a different lens and it gives a deeper respect for the day.  	 “By the seventh day God completed His work which He had some, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.  Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.”  Genesis 2:2-3   	“He rested, He blessed and He hallowed the seventh day.”  (Pg. 14, Heschel)  These passage from Genesis 2:2-3 places a direct approach to the day of rest.  As Heschel so perfectly put it, “The Sabbath is not for the sake of the weekdays; the weekdays are for the sake of the Sabbath.  It is not an interlude but the climax of living.”  All to often one may look at the Sabbath as a waste of time or too much rest, however the angle taken here is one of replenishing, the mind, body, and specifically the soul for the workweek to come.  “Labor is a craft, but perfect rest is an art” (Pg. 14) To gain perfect rest you must notice that rest is a place in time, not a duty in time.  Those who may not have a clear understanding of the Sabbath ought to consider peeking at the subject as a place in time, a point where you can have an intermission from the stresses of life rather then an obligation to fill.  Heschel responded sweetly,  “The hours of the seventh day are significant in themselves: their significance and beauty do not depend on any work, profit or progress we may achieve.  They have beauty of grandeur.” (Pg. 20)  	When an individual speaks of Shabbat or the Sabbath, which means Holy One, they consider a complete rest from anxiety or worry.  In fact, one must cease all activity that would stipend the character of bliss and joy.  “The Sabbath is no time to remember sins, to confess, to repent or even to pray for relief or anything we might need.  It is a day for praise, not a day for petitions.”  (Pg. 20)  To become so disciplined in creating the ability to clear your mind like this would take numerous years of meditation.  Although, in a real life account a women who was a maid for a prominent, Rabbi Elimelech spoke of her experience of the Sabbath day in the Rabbi’s house.  She carried on to articulate that the maids of the house would toil during the week yet when the Sabbath was arriving the tone of the house would change.  Every person through the full night would feel the need to ask each other for forgiveness.  Are we supposed to ask for forgiveness on the Sabbath?  According to Heschel it is much more then a ceasefire, rather it is a day for perfect agreement.    	As humans generally think of ways to picture of what the Sabbath is, a comparison is made at making it look like one would look to a queen or a bride.  Of course putting it into a human stance can limit the Sabbath to human standards rather then God’s standards.  Heschel stated, “The idea of the Sabbath as a queen or a bride is not a personification of the Sabbath but an exemplification of a divine attribute, and illustration of God’s need for human love; it does not represent a substance but the presence of God, His relationship to man.”  (Pg. 60)  Making such a connection to an incomparable picture was not something that Heschel thought gave due justice.  This was a comparison brought out because of a strong desire of a queen’s presence on a Saturday night.  The Sabbath is a day observed on a Friday evening.  	Kabbalat Shabbat is the name for the Friday evening service in which worship is taken place.  “The term Kabbalat denotes the act of taking an obligation upon oneself.”  (Pg. 61)  This is a clear need for obedience on our part.  However the term can also bear a different meaning. In its verbal form it signifies also: “to receive, to welcome, to greet.”  (Pg. 61)  The first premise is based on a law observation and the second premise is based more on an emotional observation.  Together this creates a mixture of obligation, dedication, and devotion, while giving it a texture that is welcoming and attractive.  	The Sabbath is analogous to what may come about in eternity.  Here is an ancient story that tells of this chronicle.    “At the time when God was giving the Torah to Israel, He said to them:  My children!  If you accept the Torah and observe my mitzvot, I will give you for all eternity a thing most precious that I have in my possession.   -And what, asked Israel, is that precious thing which Thou wilt give us if we obey Thy Torah? -The world to come. -Show us in this world an example of the world to come.”   (Pg. 407, Akiba)   This story brings out magnificence in keeping an eternal perspective.  God gave the Sabbath to see of the world to come.  This account is very sweet to the ear but how can one really feel or understand completely the splendor of God in the world today?  Although we are missing the meaning we can imagine the greatness of our roots in a plan such as this.  	Moreover, the Sabbath may have lost much of the beauty, desire, or even the stature it deserves but the truth is still there.  Heschel brings our minds and our hearts back to the meaning of this day yet he expresses a need to be obedient and take action.  Even to a person of a different belief system they can see ideas from this story and meditate on God, whomever they may be, and find rest.  I have personally been able to apply many thoughts and feelings this book portrays to my own faith.  Heschel said it marvelously,   “The seventh day was full of both loveliness and majesty-an objection of awe, attention and love.  Friday eve, when the Sabbath is about to engross the world, the mind, the entire soul, and the tongue is tied with trembling and joy-what is there that one could say?"

						    FOX NEWS : IN BOSTON —  urlLink This is a partial transcript from "The O'Reilly Factor," July 27, 2004 that has been edited for clarity .  In my opinion, Moore didn't seem very intellegent and I really think Bill O'Reilly could have done much better. They spent way too much time on 'would you send your kids to war' type of thing.   From the desk of Nick Nye :-)

						   As I read and reread Sophisticated Lady and thought about it for a few days I think I became cynical of his comments and frustrated, although he is right.  I don't think Sproul Jr. couldn't have been more accurate, that the mega-church mentality is to dumb down doctrine for the unregenerate and the sake of reaching more people. Not only do I clearly see this in many mega-churches today but I see it spreading to the smaller churches who want to get bigger. I think books like "The Purpose Driven Life" by Rick Warren are key books that have helped bring a sense of watering down doctrine for numbers. While I see many good things in books such as Warren's, I see people who will get excited for God and have no foundation to stand.  It is a complete shame that many churches/ Christians have rejected the creativity mega-churches have put forth in their evangelism, such as doing oil changes, giving stamps out during tax season, ect. I think this to be very creative and effective ONLY IF there is a solid foundation in sharing the gospel. That’s where people have the problem. It is this; "share the gospel with people, and if you must, use words." I think Francis of Assi stated something like that? I agree that this is a major problem. Serving the poor and needy is vital in keeping with Christ and bearing fruit, but leaving the doctrine of salvation by faith alone, repentance, and Lordship out of the Gospel will cause false fruit.  Moreover, instead of criticizing alone, it may be good to learn from the mega-church mentality. However, they must be rebuked for leaving doctrine out and producing false conversion. To God be the Glory!
