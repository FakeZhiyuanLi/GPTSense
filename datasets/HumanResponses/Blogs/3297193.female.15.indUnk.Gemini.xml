      I found a baby bird a while ago. Talagang kaka-hatch lang nya. The bird's still naked. lol. No feathers, and it's eyes are still closed. I still don't know if it will live and fly...fly awaaay. I was about to feed the kitty when I saw it on the floor. Akala ko nga daga e. Well, I think we adopted it. lol. Bahala na si Mama dun. May kuting na akong inaalagaan.  I told Mama na magiging Adoption Center na bahay namin. Well, binigay lang naman yung si Lucky at Jumbo. So yung inampon ko lang talaga yung Pusa. hehe.   Oooh. About a while ago. I wrote here that I would do some scanning. Well, I really did. I even took notes coz I know I'll forget the story. FYI, We will read that book on the last Quarter. Nice eh? Eh...that's the only one I can read right now. I don't want to read Florante and Laura. I'm gonna die if were going to act again in Filipino...

      Its exactly  2 more weeks  'til the start of the school year. I haven't even prepared yet, both  physically  and  mentally ...and even  emotionally . I don't know what's with the 'emotional' part.   I haven't bought the needed things for school...and my school  uniform . I don't know if it will still fit me. I hope it still does. And I don't think 2 weeks is enough for it to be corrected. I'll just make a list here of what I'll buy.   List [bookstore]: -Ballpens [red,blue,black] -Bala ng stapler  -Plastic cover -Ruler [make it 2] -Scissors [my other one is dull already so...] -Binder and fillers -Pencil -Glue -Folder -Long/Short Brown Envelope -Illustration board [para handa na..] -Olso Paper -Plastic Folder/Filler/Envelope -Bond Paper? [still have tons...] -Pad Paper? [maraming naiwan from last year] -Art Paper? [marami pa rin]   What else should I buy? Being dory....again  I haven't opened my books, haven't looked or scanned them. I still can't accept that summer is going to end in 2 weeks. I think I'll start later...openning...this afternoon, after this.   I can't write well. I still have to  practice my handwriting .   I must really  concentrate on my studies  this incoming year. It's not that I'm not satisfied with my grades last year...it's just that I want to maintain my grades. I want to study in a good college, you know.   Maybe I should  practice every afternoon  starting...later. I forgot my math, my english, my science...I think I forgot everything related to school. Or did I just want to forget them, my problems at school. Maybe I did...Maybe temporarily...

      Damn it. I missed scq today. We went to mass e. The only thing I was able to watch is the last part. *sighs*  This is the second time my finger was hurt because of a stupid wire[braces]!! Its the same hand...same wire but different finger. Thank god. The first is the pointer...second is my thumb. The first is...kinda gross. I wont mention it anymore. The second is...I was trying to floss my stupid molar. It's hard, I know, but i still have to floss my teeth you know. So...nasabit ang aking minamahal na thumb sa lintek na wire.

      The winds are blowing so hard today it feels like the trees are going to flyyy up up and awayy! It was announced this morning by DepED that only preschool and grade school classes are suspended due to the typhoon "igme" [nice name, huh?] It was signal no. 1 here in rizal and metro manila. But damn, the winds are really strong...and i liked it! It was like signal no. 2 to most of us since you can really see the trees swayiiing like the 'Womping Willow' in HP.   You can feel the wind and rain in your hair! and you cant see a thing because of the stupid strands of hair all over your face. if you're lucky enough you can taste 'em too.    The rains are so weird today. They will become strong then they will cease for a time...then become strong again! But I really dont mind the strong winds blowing...I dont care!   So uhm... Like last year, we were sent home again during lunch time. well actually, we were already supposed to start our class after lunch. I actually expected this to happen. Ganun naman palagi e. Papapasukin kami tapos papauwiin uli.   There's this certain incident that happened awhile ago that's funny. well i think it's funny. We were already going to return to class since its almost time. Then suddenly people starting shouted, cheered..downstairs and upstairs. People are 'spreading' rumors that it IS really suspended. We didnt took them seriously since many incidents liked that happened before. Then they rang the bell differently...they rang it 4-5 times and we all shouted and cheered even though we dont know what's the bell for!! I dunno why it's like that...yan lang talaga siguro nagagawa sa amin dahil sa school at gusto mo talagang umuwi. It was like a chain reaction - lol. Then we were asked to settle down inside our classrooms since our class encounter will be next week already! Then we saw someone passed thru carrying her bags. We all asked each other 'suspended nga ba talaga?!'. Then our class adviser told everyone na suspended na talaga...parang kami...'yay...' in a very bored tone - lol - naubusan na kami ng lakas para sumigaw.   [woah...this entry's kinda long...]   Kyra and I dared each other to cry - lol [ala pa naman kasi mga bus service namin]. Kahit napaka babaw ang pag iyak ko di pa rin ako naiyak - oh well.   We had double Biology since our OE teacher is not around...and gawd...I dont know if i can memorize all of the lessons we had!   Our house met already. I didnt see any familiar faces from the seniors that knows how to play softball! Hope Im wrong and i hope i was not able to look around very well.   Still have an algebra assignment to finish. Dont know how.

Im gonna buy allll of them! Just wait and see...Im gonna get all 7 of 'em!   Now im trying to remember a cartoon movie that i enjoyed when i was a kid. i kept on forgetting it's title... its about animals. all i know about that movie is that some ugly humans are spraying some toxic gas of some sort and poisoned a baby animal because it went inside it's house because its parents died. and her other friends travelled to get some medice plant. Naalala ko yung isa...i think he's a mole with a red and white scarf and round glasses. and another one is...a weasel? i cant remember... then there's this old animal that took cared of the poisoned animal... ---SINO MAY ALAM NG TITLE??  there's this movie again that i loved, The American Tail! Meron kaming tape nun dati...got destroyed like peter pan...land before time...my favorites pa naman!! Im gonna hunt for it. I know there's a part 2 of it...di ko pa napanood yun.  after watching TheLandBeforeTime...I want to watch more and more like that! I missed watching those.

      we were out the whole day. ate at a japanese restaurant. then wandered around and landed at the arcade place. i was playing the basketball thingy while the other three played at some arcade. then watched HP 3. gwapo ni harry. i didnt like the way the novel was shown. ang gwapo ni harry. ang bitin. ang weird ng mga pangyayari. sobrang daming changes. ah! gwapo ni radcliffe. i hate what they did to the werewolf. they should be cute and cuddly!! not weird and skinny!! i love wolves...i hate the person who made the werewolf ugly. lol weird ending. weird everything! hindi sila loyal sa novel! the past 2 movies are way much better than this movie. favorite ko pa naman ang 3rd book. after that...saw many batchmates....around 6 and 2 seniors. bought the stuff i needed for my lab kit. had my picture taken...waited for 30 minutes... got home. tinkered with the old microscope. played my APO cd *grins* wala yung batang bata ka pa...*frowns*

      Sandali lang talaga ako.   So alam nyo ba na 11 na ang subjects namin ngayon?! I just dont know kung paano pinagkasya ng skul ang maraming subjects plus nabawasan yung 40 mins pero nadagdagan ng 30 mins ang break namin at 5 extrang period. Ang haba tuloy ng araw.   Gawd, matagal pa ang softball namin sa PE. I still need to wait for the 4th QT parang mangyari yun..?? I just hope and pray talaga na makakapasa ako sa Softball Club. Swimming kami for the 1st semester. Were gonna learn how to do sychronized swimming.   So...Im nervous with all this HOUSE thingy. [ot: ang cute ng lamang loob ng baboy...] I dont know if im gonna cooperate with them or not. Mapapalibutan pa ba naman kami ng 3rd yrs and 1st yrs??? Malas talaga o. At hindi na by batch ang itrams...at every 2 years na lang sya!!!! BY HOUSE NA!!  Sana makasama ko ang mga co-softball members ko...  naku...i still need to look for the meaning of panitikan...

      Hmmm...Nagbago uli isip ko about my thoughts towards this school year, again. This is the REAL one na. I will really enjoy it!! Well hindi naman pala bad news ang announcement e. Its kinda weird nga lang.   Announcement kanina:  1. 1 whole hour ang lunch instead of 40 mins 2. 30 mins ang recess instead of 20 mins 3. 40 mins per class instead of 50 mins 4. 3 study periods each week after all classes 5. dismissal is 10 mins earlier 6. *Drum roll* This is the weiiirdest news. Know Harry Potter? Their houses? Like Gryffindor ? each class will be divided into 4, buong school ang kasali dito. grades 1-4, grades 5-7 at buong high school. So in total, we have 12 houses in the wholee school. We will also earn points for every good deed we do as a house[ i think thats it...], the house with the highest points by the end of the school year will have a surprise! *kids shout YAY!* The intrams might also be by houses...that's the news I dont like. It's possible na hindi kami magkakasama sa Softball...maaaring maglaban kami!   ang mga gimik talaga na iniisip ng school...tsk tsk...  AY! at ang pinaka magandang news na narinig ko ngayon ayyyyy.... Ang isang kabarkada namin ay lumipat sa section namin!! Galing :D ______   I need to bring my largest book tomorrow...BIO book. 1000 + pages...  So...its gonna be whole day tomorrow...hayyy...  ay...I dont like our schedule...weird...

      I now regret what I said yesterday. I AM not going to enjoy this school year. I didnt like what happened a while ago. So we met our teachers...well dalawa lang sila. Yung isa teacher sa AP, isa sa algebra. I dont like our teacher sa algebra, new teacher, ang hina ng boses, ang BORING. Yung sa AP, *rolleyes* bwiset, may assignment kami?! He started with a greeting in...tamil?!  namaste .. So I think we need to memorize greetings from different languages from other asian countries and learn how to write them. ANG HIRAP. I have a year to learn their language, I hope.  arghh...We need to submit some important news in asia and europe that happened during the summer. Im doing it write now. lol.  oh, we had our election of officers. Paputol putol siya dahil sumusulpot yung mga teachers. Yung popular group wanted to be officers, well, yung batch representative kasi isa sa kanila. Maybe they want to dominate our batch. Well, malas nila at hindi tanga ang majority ng class namin.   I just slept the whole afternoon. ayaw ko na magpuyat. After ng imby, matutulog na talaga ako. Late kasi e.   So yun...Im gonna finish my assignment na...[conyotic..ewww]

      This is just going to be a very very quick one.   I was supposed to post something about what happened yesterday. eh biglang nag freeze 'tong bwiset na ym, damay tuloy lahat! so.. We went to Divisoria. Ang daming tao. First time ko yun. Bought shirts, thought they were not that fitted, pero bwiset di ko type. tapos some other stuff. my dad bought a box-full of picture frames! around 30 pieces worth 70 pesos each, mura na raw since mga nasa 90 pesos yun sa mall. Napabili kami ng payong nang di oras. Biglang umulan, muntikan pa ako 'lumabas' ng sidecar dahil dumaan ito sa isang "hole", siguro instinct ko yun. dumaan kami ng UP, bili ng mangga, isaw at bbq! Dun daw nag'dadate' sila mama, mangga, isaw at buko juice under the trees! o diba? romantic? lol.   So about school. First day namin. Gawd, walang nagbago! To quote what my busmate said "para lang mahabang weekend ang summer". Totoo nga. Hindi ko feel ang pagiging 2nd year high school. Parang freshman pa rin ako, at...dumagdag pa ito, nasa same floor lang kami. kasi ang bwiset na freshmen di kasya sa 4 sections! so sa taas sila, bwiset. at least di na kami ma papagod pag akyat diba? anyway, akala namin na yung c.a. namin, cle ang tinuturo nya, kung magsalita kasi e. Nakalimutan ko kung ano yung ituturo nya. Then...yung pinaka aabangang pag sabi samin kung saang section kami! Bwiset, isa lang kasama ko sa mga kabarkada ko. Hindi ko siya gaanong ka close e. Pero nakakatawa, katabi ko ngayon ang mga naging katabi ko last year! about our t.i.c, okay naman siya! madaldal. Kami nga lang ang maingay e! yung ibang section nakakatulog na! ayyy...may parang announcement daw sa wednesday, sabi ng busmate ko parang " bawal kaming umangal. hindi magbabago ang isip nila" tapos magkakaroon raw ng MAJOR CHANGE! kakatakot...di ko gusto yun. ay! masaya ang buong school ngayon. For 3 days kaming halfday, uuwi kami ng 1pm.   hmmm...sumakit na kamay ko.   ;) i think i'll enjoy this school year. especially ang sport namin sa pe ay softballl!! yay!!

      I still don't want to go back to school. Returning to school is not the way I want in order to see my friends. The last meeting I had with them was 2 months ago. But still, I was able to call some of them once in a while.  Hay bwiset. There were many things that I wanted to do this summer. May nangyari ba? ha-ha. wala. So maybe next summer na lang. Since time made it show that it flies so fast. Maybe with a snap of my fingers...summer na naman!   I just hope na hindi ako tuluyang mawala katulad last year. Hopefully at least once a week makapagonline ako dito! ^_^

Hihilain pa siguro ako ni mama para magising ako. I'm gonna have a hard time waking up very early pag dating ng school.    eeeeeeeeeeee! oops. go romer!! go romer!! este...roh-mer.   Anyway, I'm still hungry. I know I'm always hungry but...kulang talaga yung kinain ko. I ate lunch pero hindi pa rin ako busog! *cries* Inubos kasi nila Jonathan yung ulam. Kaasar sila.

      You know what I hate right now? It's those damn mosquitos that come with the rainy season! They've been biting me since this morning!! Can't I just have the package without those mosquitos? Especially "uso" na ang dengue ngayon. And I don't want to be suffering from those. You can die from dengue fever you know!!! I don't know about you, but I don't want to die yet! Especially because of those stupid mosquitos.   *sigh* I'll be seeing those younger grade schoolers wearing dengue attire again. Wearing long-sleeves and pants.   Why are they so unfair? lol We are all the same. Why? Are the older students immune to those mosquito bites? Well, I don't think so. Well I don't want to wear dengue attire.  Something like that happened to us last year. Well let me cross out those mosquitos. It was a rainy day. We hoped and prayed that classes would be suspended because of the weather. Well, Classes was suspended. But only for Grade School and Preschool!!! Kaming high school lang ang nasa school?! Bwiset sila. Ano yun? Porket mas malaki kami kesa sa kanila eh hindi na kami liliparin ng hangin? Well, hehehe, We were sent home during lunch break. The winds were really blowing hard. You could hear the winds whistle. Someone in my class whistled. Kasi yun ang sabi-sabi ng matatanda, when you whistle the wind will answer you back. Most of us was not paying attention to our teacher. Well, I think she noticed that because she somewhat change the topic. Nagkwekwentuhan na lang kami doon..  Dapat kasi pag signal number one hindi pinapauwi ang grade school. Before, Pre School students are the only ones sent home. Dapat high school rin!!

      The dirty ice cream scene with Romer reminded me of something that happened to me when I was a little kid... *grins*  After buying one, I went back inside. Before reaching the door, the ice cream on top fell! So I went outside to have my cone "refilled". Then it happened again! Then well you know what happened next...The ice cream fell again for the 3rd time!! Hanggang sa 3rd time na lang yun. I made sure na hindi na siya mahuhulog. Kasi I think when I licked it...the ice cream went with the flow. Nasobrahan ba ung lakas ng pag lick ko? lol

      Gawd, My brother's annoying. VERY annoying. Nakakabwiset na talaga. Gusto kong mapag-isa dito sa kwarto ko at manood. Darating siya bigla at sisirain nya ang mood ko. Tapos ayaw na niyang umalis sa kwarto ko. Si mama naman kumakampi sa kanya. Nakakabwiset talaga. Ano ba problema nya?! Tapos pag pinapaalis ko sya nagagalit siya. Bwiset talaga. Ganun ba talaga ang mga lalaki?! Lagi na lang sila KSP?!? Lagi na lang siya ganyan! Bigla biglang susulpot dito sa kwarto ko at ayaw nang umalis. Tapos may gana pa siyang magalit?! Eh siya nga ang nag-iinvade ng privacy ah! Inaano ko ba siya?  Ginugulo ko ba siya? Hindi! eh bakit ba siya nandito!!! Ayaw umalis! Bwiset siya!!

      I'm tired. Been out the whole day.  Oh. We were supposed to watch HP 3 pero ang daming tao!! Yung isa, standing room na lang! Kaya Shrek 2 na lang pinanood namin.:D I loved the cat. lol. He looks like the kitten I adopted! Paawa effect pa yung pusa [I like!].  So after nun, naglaro si jonathan dun sa arcade. Kami? nakatunganga lang habang kumakain ng ice cream. Naubos na ice cream namin at lahat...di pa rin sya tapos! So...guess what?! May mouse pad na rin ako!! yay! lol Yun binili ko. Atsaka safety pin, para kung kailangan nun ready na ako!  So bumili ako ng 2 cd. Himala ba? Yung sa Bamboo at kay Christian Baustista. :D Meron na rin akong The way You look at me.  I-uupload ko sya pag may space na sa briefcase.   Oh. Nung uuwi na kami, tumawag si Mama dun sa Sta Lucia yung sa taxi. Fixed na price nya. Depende na lang yung price kung saan ka uuwi. Bwiset talaga. Ang tagal naming naghintay dun sa baba. Dun pala sya sa isa pang floor pumunta! lol    Akala ko di ko na maabutan ang SCQ kids. Pagbukas ko ng tv, eksaktong eksaktong patapos na yung NGINIG. So yay! Naumpisahan ko siya. Pero di ko nakita kung sino ang Grand Questor sa Kids, nag simba kasi kami e. Pero nagtext sa akin si ate nina. YAY! si nash! Cute kid talaga...

      I don't know if this is good or bad. Good because I was able to wake up early and didn't have to use an alarm clock. Bad because I slept at 1 then woke up at 5?! Gawd, I slept for 4 hours? Mas marami pa akong nakukuhang tulog pag may klase kami. But maybe this is already a good start for me? I dunno...para masanay na ako na magising at matulog ng maaga? Well 1am is already early for me...kesa naman 3 or 4am ako natutulog diba?  So starting on Monday...I'll sleep at around 11 or 10. Then I'll wake up early...then return to my bed again! lol. Nah. Maybe I'll just watch tv or read "Things fall apart". But I won't write the summary, it's sooo tiring ,don't you know?  Eeeep! My braces' gonna be adjusted today, isn't that great?? eh what's great about not eating properly. Sheesh. Then we'll go out and watch Book 3 of HP!! yay! I just love that book..It's da bestest ever in da whole history of me!!!! [lol]

      Nung pauwi kami ng mom ko at bro ko mula sa bookstore, napagusapan namin pinsan ko. Ikakasal na sya bukas?! Pero yung sa harap ng judge. Magkaiba kasi sila ng religion. Isa catholic yung isa Inglesia... Nagmamadali kasi sila. Ayaw maghintay.   So...parang pinagsasabihan ako ng mom ko yung tungkol sa usual talk about Love & Marriage. Bigla ba namang sinabi sakin na huwag ako magsesex before marriage! napa irap ako! lol Hindi ako ganun ka...ka...ano...para gawin yun noh! Tapos yung bro ko naman nagtatanong "Bakit masama pag magsex bago ikasal?". Nakuuu! Sarap batukan talaga ang kapatid ko!   Hay naku pow talaga...

      After weeks of whining and begging...the day has finally come!! I successfully bought my needed school supplies!! I don't have to worry anymore! yay!   The only things that I need are those...that are...needed everyday! Like comb,[I've lost many of those...kaasar talaga], elastics, oooh...I need a pair of pantyhose  pag may misa kasi...kailangan naka gala uniform. e may butas na yung akin.  what else, socks...I don't need to buy shoes. I still have my shoes from last year.  nakakahinayang kasi e. pag okay pa yung sapatos tapos bibili pa ng bago..  I think...that's the only stuff I need to buy...  So I've finished reading Gapo!! I enjoyed reading it.  Yung badtrip lang talaga yung ending.  Then I started on the other book, the one for English. Gawd,  Nahilo ako sa mga pangalan nila!!  So...I won't read it anymore. I'll wait for my teacher to give us the signal to read it..  I went to a party a while ago. It's my neighbor's 18th bday. But,  sa isang tabi lang ako, kinakausap ang pusa.  Then she left me.  Bwiset talaga!    So...I missed IMBY and SCQ.

      Didn't I just promised that I would scan my books or even read them? Well, I'm already half-way through! Yay! Good for me!   I'm reading the one for Filipino. It's called Gapo. The accent is stressed on the second syllable. I'm also making "summaries" of each kabanata. So that I wont forget the story when its 4th Quarter already.   Well, its a weird story. It's mainly about the discrimination between the black, the white and the brown during the 70's in Olongapo City....hence, the title of this book. Those pinoys are grouped into 2 those who loved and those who hated the white. It's also about the desire of the pinays to at least have a glimpse of this wonderful world of the white. And also...about a GI baby who has a heart of a true pinoy. Don't ask me what's a GI baby...Di ko alam kung ano yun :P

      Uh...the baby bird died. Well I think it's because of the banana. yeah...the banana! It's the only food that the bird can eat...este swallow. This is what I said yesterday after a few swallows. "oooh my god. The banana! I see the banana!...I see the banana!!" lol. You can see the stupid banana inside it's throat!! It's side is bulging! very disgusting...But it didn't die because of the banana. I am the only one in this house who thinks that it died from too much banana intake. It died because of those stupid ants! I hate ants. Especially those red ones...they bite!

Magiging double period na siya...every friday. So naapektuhan ang aming double lab. So we had double BIO a while ago...and i got 55/60 dun sa UT1 namin! Eh after our bio class OE na. Hindi na ako nakikinig kay Sir M...eh tungkol sa bio trip lang naman pinag usapan nila for almost 1 whole period...yeah nila...di kasi ako kasali. &nbsp;  so...gawd, ang sabog ng Oral test ko. Ang labo. Nawala ako pagdating dun sa talent part. Hindi ko nasabi ang dapat kong sasabihin...at bakit&nbsp;ba ang laki laki ng mga ngiti ng mga kaklase ko? hay naku...tapos yung fishbowl question sakin "if you will be reborn again where do you want to be born?" something like that. Nanlaki mata ko...namutla raw ako. Tumakbo isip ko sa lahat ng bansa na alam ko.&nbsp; sinabi ko na I dont want to be born anywhere else...im proud to be a filipino...stuff like that. basta ang labooo. Bakit ba di ko naisip na hindi nga ako pinanganak dito sa pinas...diba? tsk tsk...hindi talaga aandar ng maayos ang utak ko pag under pressure...  Hindi ko matanggap na...tapos na ako! lol its so weird. I was having a hard time in eating. Good thing I decided to eat baked mac...and not rice with ulam... [lol taglish - ano ba english ng ulam...?] Nahirapan pa rin ako dun sa baked mac...sarap ilabas:P its the same feeling i had during kapatiran week. lol  Ang bangag bangag ko kanina. So after lunch...we had HomeRoom, English, CAI, and then Filipino. Ok pa sana sa homeroom e. pero pagdating sa english....its ZZZzzzzzzz time!!! I almost fell asleep! If you could just see my handwriting in my english notebook... gawd, parang handwriting ng isang bata! mas matino pa ata ang handwriting nila e:P Then finally and thank god natapos rin ang english...then CAI! Parang siyang remedial sa Algebra? Basta may connection siya with algeb and computers. Naka titig lang kami ng partner ko sa monitor! Tapos pa silip silip sa mga quizzes sa fil :P pagdating ng fil...Ang sakit na ng ulo ko! wala na akong pakialam kung baksak ang filipino UT1 ko.   gusto ko nang mag friday!! softbaall!!

Maybe I'll do more if Im time pressured. whatever...*rolleyes*   Finished most of the tiny homeworks and I want to end it already! I want to finish that comiks for Filipino. It would have been much better if&nbsp;that project is&nbsp;individual not&nbsp;a group work... I could make it better. Dont need to ask&nbsp;your co-members if what i did is ok. dont need to worry&nbsp;if&nbsp;i get the story a little different than what was planned... and i dont think we can pass it tomorrow. Dont care about the additional points. Eh kung mamadaliin lang yang komiks na yan...panget din...so whats the use of the additional points diba?   oh yeah...Im not satisfied with my grade in algeb. I know im a bit...weird. saying that a 96 is not ok. well it is ok. but the mistakes i made is just so stupid...so...so...stupid. Must open my eyes a little more. I was supposed&nbsp;to add&nbsp;2 two-digit numbers&nbsp;together...but i added the first digits then multiplied the 2nd digits together...how stupid of me to make that mistake...so so stupid. but hey...its still&nbsp;the first quarter...i can still&nbsp;try&nbsp;to get a much ok grade. lol   So...its raining...i just hope the raining will stop during clubs...im just excited to play softball...its been half a month....half a monnnth!!!! [edit:&nbsp;that month over there...is really year...]&nbsp;  and...this is just weird. i didnt post any entry like that below. the one with 6 tiny pictures of i dunno... i dont know where it came from...so weird   and...im&nbsp;heres the poem i made yesterday for english class...    A Bucketful of Stones   Born into a world full of expectations  Suddenly embracing a spoonful of obligations  A baby does what he is expected to do  Cuddling close, giving joy as a baby should   Seconds, days, months, and years ticked away  Turning a spoonful slowly to a bucketful  A kid does what he is expected to do  Doing a little math, playing as a kid should   A sister and daughter I was born to be  Giving them more love than they expected from me  Trying hard not to give them problems  Hugging them if needed, and extras are given   A student I am when school came  Listening and understanding the lessons all day  To the teachers, whom I owe all my learnings  Deserve the love and respect I am giving   Here and there, a friend I am to everyone  Lending both my shoulders to cry on,  To both good and bad issues I listen to  Behind I don’t leave them but beside them I stay   Stones filling the bucket and currently is overflowing  Into their real forms I carve them  Accomplishing the things I should  And now, a baby and kid I’m not  But stones I cracked, being the imperfect person that I am  Struggling in every single way that I can  To turn these bucketful of stones into jewels&nbsp;

      Ooooh...blogspot got something new. Tagal na siguro nito...  anyway, this week is the most most hectic, most hell-ish week ever in my wholee whole school life!! Gawd, good thing  almost  everything is over...almost everything! only 2 more UT1s to go...and that, i think, would be given to us next week...  and what i said an entry ago... we had 4 tests each day. well we were supposed to be free of tests today...well except for a practical test in Lab... so nervous. Im gonna be the 2nd one to take it next week. Di ko kaya! How will I be able to finish mounting and focusing a microscope under time pressure?! and 1 minute lang?!&nbsp;And only a few...only a few got a perfect score of 20!! and you can only get a score of 0, 5, 10, 15&nbsp;and 20! *sigh* And i got a week to worry all about it.   gaaaawd, OE practical test&nbsp;next wednesday! I havent thought of a creative name to describe my communication/thinking skills. I.am.not.creative.at.things.like.this.and.i.hate.this....so..god help me..please?&nbsp;&nbsp;Im never creative at some things...or maybe all? Pleaaase magkaroon ng miracle at maging creative na lang ako bigla? hay naku...  anyway, i dont know what i got in Business Math...the equivalent i mean. But i dont care if its line of 8. Its my fault why i got that score. Should have &nbsp;read the instructions first before answering them. So stupid...but i hope my score in algebra wont be the same. Hope its higher... And Bio...gawd. NO ERASURES? what does he think of us? perfect students who doesnt commit mistakes? Eh we cant avoid that! And were also under time pressure.&nbsp;Oh well, i dont expect to get a score of 90 and above...&nbsp;  anyway, what else...Oh...APPPP! Gawd, ang sobrang dali!!! Pero grabe talaga. I studied for almost 3 hours last night almost memorizing chapter 1...i said almost...not totally. Well...parang alam mo na na hinde? Pero ala talagang pumapasok sa utak ko! Eh may dumating sa akin na&nbsp;balita na dapat memorize mo yung evaluation part ng chapter 3 & 4...daya ano? Buti na lang talaga at narinig ko yun! kung hindi....almost 20 points ang mawawala sa akin... And he didnt even change the order of the answers...tsk tsk... Well...good for me. lol  Softball. *grins* Halos lahat ng ka-group ko hindi alam na kami ang group 1. my first game this year, ever and i ended up being the pitcher again...i was assigned by ate karen. nice. i guess, she remembered me from&nbsp;last year's intramurals... She just said and pointed to me "Kaw ang pitcher natin" period.&nbsp;I guess i&nbsp;pitched fine...compared to the others [kapal ko]...I threw strikes *grins proudly*&nbsp; I guess that's the  only  thing that i contibuted to the 2 games we played. Gawd, i think i need my eyeglasses during clubtime. I can't bat properly for heaven's sake. I was only&nbsp;able to bat the ball at least 3-4 feet away from me?! at almost foul ball pa siya! How humiliating... Almost all pitchers that i have seen can bat properly. eh ako? walaaa! or maybe nasa pitcher din yun? ganun kaya yun? hay naku... at full bases pa nun...gawd, they even said na "uy!! home run!" hay naku... hate it. I really hate it pag kami ang una sa batting...kahit kelan basta mag bat. ayaw ko...na.&nbsp;  So i guess ito na?...woah...it took me almost 2 hours to finish this entry...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Had an headache from breaststroking(??). Good thing wala kaming practical test dun. I think I finally did it right. lol There's a cockroach in the bathroom!! And lumilipad pa siya. Buti na lang...lumabas siya dun sa bathroom room...lol its not a room kasi e. open sya sa labas...While doing the push thing i raised my head and i drank a lot of water...ewww...  anyway, almost every afternoon Choups(not her real name) and I kept on staying at the cafeteria doing homeworks while eating. Most are algebra homeworks, we compare answers and those kind of things. And a while ago, we didnt knew how to answer the very easy question so coincidentally we saw our algeb teacher and she told us what to do. Natuwa ata sa amin si Ms V. Now the teachers have a good impression on us - lol. eh were the type of nerdy looking because of the glasses and braces. Then i said something like "Akala mo naman kung sino ang mga matatalino...yun pala ginagawa lang nila yun para magkaroon pa ng oras sa internet!!" bwahahaha - lol.   We had a sort of make up quiz for AP since most of us had failing marks in the previous 20-item quiz. He mentioned it last Mon or Tues but we were not sure if were going to have it today. Some were studying during lunch but unfortunately, I have to do something for English and had no time to study. And I didnt even open the book last night. I mostly guessed the answers and I still got the same score from the previous quiz!  And for the whole week, we watched Mula sa Puso the movie during Filipino classes. Ang cute cute ni Rico Yannn!! Yun lang lol.  I want to make a site…site ko lang. Di nga lang ako marunong. I have the idea kung paano sya ginagawa pero…di ko talaga kaya!!!   Oh..kay…Seldy called a while ago asking if I could do her a favor. Its about the group reporting in English. She wants me to draw the king of the demons, Ravanna. Eh di ko alam itsura nya. So I have to look for a picture in the net….and that’s what I gonna do now.

      [edited...finally...] I am now going to try and recollect what was supposed to be written here… and I am now using Microsoft word so that it will not happen anymoreeee. And now I cant remember anything…  Everything that occupied my mind for the whole week ended last Friday! Quizzes and experiments are now finished! Yay for me! And we’re starting a new week and it means more and more assignments and quizzes. * groans *   So our class encounter is normal. Not that bad and not that excellent. But my hand experienced hell for 2 hours writing 47 notes to everyone in the class. Slept 2 hours earlier than last year’s. We slept with the lights on, didn’t knew where the switch is located. Found out all about it the next morning. Breakfast was cold. Didn’t enjoy that. Took pictures after our class encounter ended [wow. Sobrang detailed talaga nito ah] I was the only one left. My parents came at 9…and that’s an hour late…? Then I slept for almost 5 hours after eating lunch.   We watched Spiderman 2 yesterday! Yay!! Finally watched it and I’d give it a lot of thumbs up!! Ang gandaaaaaaa! There’s this only one thing that I hate. Nasa pinakaharap kami!!!!!!!!!! Waaaaaaaaaaah! Laki ng screen. Nakakaduling. Punong puno ang buong sinehan! Hay naku…  I didn’t realize that my wallet fell somewhere during the class encounter. And I don’t know where it fell!!! It’s not in my room or in any place in this house!! Si manang na lang talaga ang aking huling kong pag asa!! Kailangang makita nya yun sa formation house [that’s where we had our class encounter]!! Or else a not-so-large sum of money will be lost!! It became my habit not to empty my wallet after school. My wallet became a sort of piggy bank.  I was so bored during AP. Some of us want to sleeeeeep. Or maybe a lot of us… I kept on yawning and my eyes kept on watering… and I wanted to fall asleep. But I can’t afford to miss one minute of discussion. Sir B keeps on telling stories that he might include in quizzes…   So yay! We should have our Bio Quiz tomorrow but since were a little late in our lessons it was moved to Thursday!! So so happpy!   The ones Raphael, Roxanne and Errol wore a while ago during Reload is the one they wore when I went to the taping. So I guess some scences a while ago are the ones they taped last week.  Hehe… want more of Reload. Bitin sya! 10 ba namang kwento ang ipagkakasya sa isang series…

      another hectic day. Its a hot day. then afternoon came lumamig. hindi naman umulan.   I got 12 points in our quiz in biology awhile ago. Got 2 extra points! *grins* yay! The quiz was ok. But i wasted many minutes reviewing my notes. Maybe twice was enough - oh well. Going to have our Unit Test I next thursday. I want to faiiint. All those cycles and all those compounds and terms....*cries*   We had an assignment yesterday that i would say is the easiest among all assignments. I enjoyed that assignment.   And for the first time, I enjoyed our algebra class. Well i didnt pay attention to what she was saying. I was doing our assignment. So challenging.   Awhile ago. we were sent to the LRC to look for a story about drug pushers. For the whole period we just wasted our time looking for one. We were the only ones who are standing! Then we were looking for one in old newspapers and suddenly all of our classmates started rising and returning their clippings/articles. Then we grabbed 3 from someone who is about to return theirs. We had them photocopied. we kept on saying "manong!!! paki bilis!! bilisan mo manong!!" After paying, takbooooo! nahabol pa namin ang pinakahuling girl sa linya. bloopers....*sigh*

      gawd, today was so...so...school-like!! And Monday pa ngayon ha! What a nice way to start a week!   Our teacher in bio kept on giving out exemptions for our short quiz tomorrow! And i was stupid enough to not raise my hand for recitation! Well, didnt knew the answers...so dont want to answer something i dont really know.   after asking a question...we answered him by staring at him with our mouths wide open! after so many things he said...which he said was cluesss...someone guessed the answer...my gawd! Sir Bio said "you will be exempted in the quiz tomorrow!" mas lalong lumaki ang bibig namin, naki sabay pa yung mga mata namin!!   damn. but i confidentally know that i will pass that short quiz, unlike what happened to AP...But AP is so different than Bio. I read my notes thrice already. sana naintindihan ko yung mga yun... *crosses fingers*  Then had that quiz in Business Math. Nakakaloka ang mga tanong... Ang laki ng mga numerooo! Pero, Kahit na ibaksak ko yun, I dont care.  Then AP came. kakaloka rin. So many words and terms to memorize! Dont think I can handle it. We still need to memorize the map of ASIA! Need to draw them.   And the last main thing that made this day so school like?! ..its the  heat! ! Malagkit pa rin ako 'til now. While were inside the bus, waaahhh, para kaming nasa loob ng stove!

      been too tired yesterday to even open the pc. Too much school work i guess...or maybe its the pain that the arm wrestling gave me, still aches.   ...but we only had 2 academic subjects yesterday. Can 2 academic subjects give someone a terrible headache? Oh..yeah. Had double lab. i wasnt able to finish the experiment. had a difficult time mounting the...i dunno...the microscope? or specimen? the specimen kept on going to the edge of the mounting medium, in other words, water. All the electric fans were turned off...our specimen might fly away. Finished only 3 specimen...it should be 5 - oh well. Im gonna...ehehehe...do something about it.

      So yeah...classes wasnt suspended today. damn it. But since it was signal #1 early this morning...my brother didn't have to go to school for the second time!! Hate it. It's sooo unfair. Is the sun appearing behind the clouds a part of signal # 1 of a typhoon?!?! It was not signal # 1 awhile ago well not for us! It was like any other day! The winds are blowing and the sun is shining! No change! Nothing flew, nothing swayed. And in fact I never wore my jacket today! The moment I stepped out of the bus service...hot air met my face...removed the jacket the moment I got inside the classroom.  So okey...I was too preoccupied with finishing book 5 of HP yesterday to study for a quiz in AP. I had the entire afternoon to study still I didnt cared...don't know why. I was not surprised when we checked our papers. I guess I was already expecting a failing mark. Didnt put enough effort to even memorize the book! Well the ones I read and understood didnt came out in the quiz and those I just skipped came out! Didnt mind...didnt cared. *removes the thought of the quiz away*  During recess instead of reviewing for AP we had arm wrestling! My arm ached after that. Well both my arms did ache but the left arm waited till lunch to suffer the consequences of arm wrestling. We were making so much noise that 2 teachers 2 tables away from us made us stop. They actually looked amused at what we were doing. They stared at us for almost 2 minutes grinning! I guess we were the topic of their discussion since they keep on glancing at us. We just laughed it off...again didn't cared. In fact, I enjoyed arm wrestling. Feels like your a kid again...as if im not one.   But the real consequence of that arm wrestling came when we had our swimming class. I was going well with doing freestyle until we did backstrokes. My arm really ached at that moment! I dunno...may be it got a little overstretched or maybe twisted when i swam. Good thing the pain subsided...but still my arms are aching right now.   So there...tomorrow's our first choice for our clubs already! And that's the only thing I look forward to every friday now. All the subjects are fine except one and you know that of course...house meetings. I really don't know the purpose of having and sorting us into houses. The only thing i know that we will do every meeting is to practice for the so called 'activity week' where they will stuff all the activities of the whole school year into that one week only!! I really dont know how will that happen...They are just so weird...And I dont like it.
