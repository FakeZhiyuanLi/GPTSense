      Mid-term exams are finally over!!! *heaves a sigh of relief* managed to drag myself across the last hurdle which was english, and though i think i messed up a bit on my literature and summary it went okay i suppose. I even got back my maths objective paper today.. damn why cant teachers take more time marking papers..?? turns out i got 5 questions wrong compared to the 3 i was expecting.. big letdown for me. Even worse was seeing other classes get back their accounts marks and looking at their scores, that alone is depressing enough (u can stop laughing over there dom). I actually got conned by someone in another class when he told me he got the lowest mark in the class which was 74. I couldnt believe it but he just kept going on and on about it and making it sound so realistic. Thankfully another friend came and told me it was all B*S so i could breath easy for the rest of the day...  Well with the end of exams i can finally do somethin ive been waiting to do for the past 2 weeks - Watch Movies!! its quite good timing that exams end just as spiderman 2 comes out.. sometimes i wonder whether teachers actually plan for it to happen this way.. nah they couldnt hve im just dreaming... Hopefully ill be able to drag a few friends along to watch this. It feels like everyone is not really eager to watch this movie or they hve already started glueing themselves to textbooks.. well i suppose i should be doing that soon but just not yet =P

      another day and another weekend gone.. marking the start of another week. exams are coming to an end with the last paper on wednesday(too bad for all u science students hve to suffer for 1 more day :P). well today wasnt such a bad day, finished off my sermon last night and delivered it this morning, ended up being a bit short although we ended on time. Its funny how when youre writing an essay u think its long enough but when u actually read it out it doesnt take too long.. maybe coz i read too fast.. :D  Went to my cousin sisters house yesterday to celebrate her babies 1 month bday, which just makes me an uncle AGAIN for the ump-teenth time. Almost got lost looking for her house somewhere in Bukit Jelutong. We were in a 3 car convoy and it was somethin like the blind leading the blind since none of us really knew the way. When we finally reached her housing estate we made a wrong turning because we had directions to turn right at the field, unfortunately the leading car turned when they saw a patch of undeveloped land which they thought resembled a field.. so we ended going round the whole estate before finding her house.. and even then when we reached her house we almost went past it coz my aunty kept insisting it was further down the road when we were actually right next to it!! Luckily my mum and another cousin had the presence of mind to see the caterers outside the house and figure out that that was the house.. as for my aunt.. well she just drove further down the road till we called her and told her to drive back again... ahhh what would we do without handphones..??  To say a bit about football, i must say im quite happy that France lost(haha too bad for u Ken!!). it feels even better when they were beaten by Greece who were not supposed to make it past the group stages, and its also sweet revenge for them beating England during their group match... May The Upsets Continue!!!

      well its finally the weekend after a looong week of exams. cant say im happy with my performance in all my subs since i know i cudve done better if i had just studied that little bit more, but i suppose everyone feels the same way after exams.. Todays paper was science and accounts objective paper. almost had a big drama when someone got caught for cheating, lucky for her she managed to talk her way out of it - to lim yoke kheng of all teachers. Personally my own science paper was a flop.. didnt study much the day before since i was busy with this blog, and when i finally got round to studying i fell asleep till dinner time. Siigh just goes to show how great i am at studying...  But even though it's the weekend i cant relax yet, im speaking in church on sunday and i havnt even prepared my sermon. To make matters worse its supposed to be a discussion so im supposed to discuss my points with my friend. Well i guess ill be doing another rush job as always.. cant say im proud of it though. I know i should be paying even more attention to that than my studies but when theres no mood to do it, there is really no mood to do it....  On a more happier note, i must say that slowly but surely im getting the hang of this blog, although im doing it mostly by copying from other ppl's blog..(sorry Robyn~!!) hopefully ill be able to get a few pics in soon and also add a msg box or somethin...

      heres my first post to my very own blog!! this is my first time with a blog so im still learning the ropes..hopefully ill be able to learn quick and make some improvements soon. well if anyone is wondering how i came up with this title for my blog, it actually comes from the bible when adam and eve lived in the garden of eden. i actually wanted to call it adams apple but that turned out to be taken..so oh well...

      Ok i&nbsp;know&nbsp;i havnt been updating this blog that often lately but its been really hard to do it without the music working on my site. Besides nothing spectacular has been happening recently anyway. Ill just give a small update of my last post.   After the dust settled on the football field, the final match between 5a and p2 ended with a 2-0 score. Quite surprising really since p2 had practically dominated their first 2 games.   I took 2 days off school after pulling my leg muscles so i ended up having a 4 day weekend from thursday to sunday. =D&nbsp;   Someone found Dom's wallet so he got it back although all the money and cards inside were missing except for his IC.    School has been a real drag of late and im not sure why... Maybe its because ive been having overseas relatives staying with me so my whole routine has been disrupted.&nbsp;I had 2 cousins and an aunt staying with me from saturday to sunday and after that another 3 relatives took over from monday to&nbsp;wednesday.. So for about 3 nights i was sleeping on the floor in my parents room... It was certainly not comfortable and&nbsp;having to get up for school the next morning didnt help matters while in school &nbsp;i just dozed during and in between lessons. Robyn slumping down on the table beside me every now and then also did not help me stay awake either. My whole class&nbsp; has been rushing to finish their seni folio and robyn has been no exception. Thank goodness i dropped seni !! ^^v Even without seni i still havnt been able to escape doing any projects though... moral project has been a real pain in the arse for me. i know everyone tells me that its so easy to write about but i just cant seem to think of anythin to write down. Its even more annoying having to take pictures doing some stupid thing like cleaning the windows or mopping the floor. As of now im still looking for someone to help me print out my pictures. Im supposed to pass up the project tomorrow. Doesnt look like ill be able to do that now....  Everyone got back their report cards today. As expected not everyone is happy with their results this time. With less then a 100 days to go before spm,&nbsp; the feeling to just curl up and hide grows bigger&nbsp;and bigger. Thinking about what im going to be doing after november is very nice, but then i snap back to reality and realize theres still that great divide to cross which is spm... sigh why cant exams just be a breeze for me..? why cant i be like some who can have all the fun they want and still bring back good results...? Sighh i guess i should be contented with what i have and am given, as the verse in the bible goes :- "Godliness with contentment is great gain".  For those who have not watched King Arthur yet, Pls!! Go watch it!! To me its worth it just to see Keira as Guinevere shooting some Saxons dead with her bow.. but thats just my opinion. =P&nbsp; Seriously though the movie is really worth watching although of course the battles arent as big and wild as LOTR. But what would u expect to see when u have only about&nbsp;6 knights and a bunch of woodmen defending a whole fortress...? Not exactly going to get to see something similar to the seige of Gondor are we..? I also think that they could have shown more on Lancelot while he was growing up and training with Arthur and the rest. But at the end i give King Arthur 4 and a half stars out of 5.&nbsp;one star solely becoz Keira is in it... =P

      As the saying goes - when it rains it pours... damn watta bad day i had in school today. Started the day by being late for school(as usual). Luckily i made it before the second bell so i didnt hve my name taken down in the book or tht would hve been my 11th time late i think.. That must hve been the only good thing tht happened to me all day, the rest of it was just crap.  First 2 periods was pjk. Only 4 of us actually practiced passing the frissbee, the rest were all playing football. Imagine having a match after school and only 4 out of 10 ppl actually bothered to practice. Made the mistake of not taking a spare t-shirt to wear, so had no choice but to wear back the same dirty&nbsp;and muddy t-shirt for the match later tht day. &nbsp;Thankfully it managed to dry somewhat before school ended.. but more on that later, for now, lets talk about the next 3 periods.  By the time i managed to clean off all the grime and dirt off myself, i had already missed 1 period so i had to go straight to the dewan kuliah for a lecture on retailing and IT or somethin lidat... Well when i got there i was sweating like a pig so i only wanted to enjoy the cool air the aircon was blowing out and didnt really care what the guy was crapping about anyway... I learnt a valuable lesson though - nvr sit near others who are making lots of noise, even if its 1 or 2 benches behind. Somehow teachers will group u in together with them and blame the whole lot for disturbing the peace. Thats what happened to me and my friends and we ended up being scolded along with the others. The best part came when the teacher was giving out fliers advertising the course.. we wanted to take some but she wouldnt give it to us coz she said we were part of those making noise. When we argued we were from a different class and sitting behind, i think her exact reply was "i dont care, just shut up." haha tht was pretty funny since she was directing it at szeyen. =D&nbsp; It wasnt very funny later when she made us the last to walk out of the dewan... she actually threatened us to argue with her whether we should be let out sooner.. luckily none of&nbsp;us took up the challenge or that would hve probably been the end for whoever....  After recess we continued normal class. Everyone was still debating whether they were gona stay for the match or not. It didnt help matters when the general idea was 'if he stays i stay'. Well at the end of the day practically everyone stayed so it wasnt so bad after all. As for the match itself.. well it didnt go very well.&nbsp; Lost to s2 1-0 and tht was with 1 point disallowed for us. Damn should have argued more with the linesman. How can he say its out when the referee says its in??? Ah well i guess whats done is done. at least they got beaten 3-0 by p2 in the next match..hehehe....  After the game we were all feeling pretty down and scolding each other but thats just normal of us i suppose. Ken as usual wasnt satisfied and wanted to go down and play summore. szeyen wasnt happy with tht since he wanted to go home but ended up staying until 4 oclock till he couldnt wait any longer and just went home by himself..haha... as for myself.. halfway through playing i suddenly pulled not one, but both my calve muscles. DAMN tht hurts bad. Took a loong time before i could hobble back to the canteen. took an even longer time to hobble my way out of school to wait for my mum to pick me up. Even worse was Dominic couldnt find his wallet when he came back after his match. Came back happy his class was in finals and went home sad his wallet was stolen...tht helps to make me feel not so bad about myself..=D  The drama doesnt end there though. When my mum picked me up she said she hadnt been able to find her handbag the whole day. Luckily i remembered that it had dropped into the backseat of my dads car when she sent me to school in the morning. Thankfully dad hadnt set off for JB yet or my mum would hve been stuck without all her stuff for 3 whole days!! So after picking me up we drove all the way to subang parade just to get the handbag back and then drive all the way home again.. sighh the more i think about it the more depressing it feels..lolz  So to summarize one of the worst days of the year :- - came to school late - got scolded unfairly by teacher - didnt take spare clothes to wear  - lost frissbee match to s2 1-0 - pulled muscle while practicing - dom lost his wallet - mum almost lost handbag - death happened to neighbour across the street(ok i know this sounds pretty irrelevent but still... :p)

      The past few days hve NOT been very fun for me. Spent the week in school getting the rest of our test results back, and of course for people who dont study like me, these are very terrible times. =P There were still a few humorous moments though, like the incident of kenneth's ciggerate for example, hence the title for this post(if u notice my links, ive even changed the name of his link.. lolz)   What &nbsp;happened u ask? Well contrary to what Szeyen said in his blog, i had actually read and seen&nbsp;Ken's blog earlier, more specifically his new blog title before&nbsp;szeyen messaged me to tell me to look at it.&nbsp;=D&nbsp; When i first saw it, i was like WTF..?? i mean who in&nbsp;their right minds would&nbsp;put a title like this?? quote from kens blog title :- " LIFE IS LIKE A CIGARETTE-it starts from a spark n you choose the type of life you want to live ."&nbsp;Later&nbsp;that&nbsp;night when i saw szeyen online and told&nbsp;him about it, &nbsp;i found out our reactions were both the same, we both&nbsp;thought 'WTF???' when we saw it...althought he took it 1 step further by thinking to himself "what a dumbA$$" hahaha. Im quite sure Robyn's reaction must have been quite similar when she saw it, although i didnt really find out in detail. =D &nbsp; Well u can imagine how annoyed we were at that time after seeing that title, since ciggerates is one of the last things we want ken to be mentioning.. lolz.&nbsp; But when we were talking about it the next morning in class between the 3 of us we actually found it quite amusing. Szeyen didnt want me to mention it to ken&nbsp;but i still called him over and asked him about it. The Result? Endless laughter for almost a whole period!! lolz&nbsp; We ended up thinking of other stupid phrases like " life is like a lighter - light up other peoples ciggerate before your gas runs out "&nbsp; According to ken, he came up with that blog title after watching the movie Forest Gump and hearing Tom Hanks say " Life is like a box of chocolates "... although how he managed to draw a comparison between chocs and ciggs is totally beyond me...ahah &nbsp; So that was the main highlight of the week, although there were other things such as the continuous drama of robyn and CJ(omg im gonna get skinned alive for saying this =P) and the first time doing qi gong during pjk period..haha&nbsp; There were also not-so-fun moments such as my streamyx not working for the whole of yesterday and this morning!! man that really got me annoyed..i thought i would have to call up streamyx and wait for a few days before getting my connection back. Luckily it started working again at about 2pm today..someone else must have already made a complaint before me ^^&nbsp; &nbsp; Talking a little about movies.. i wanted to book tickets for king arthur this weekend but found out they were already all fully booked!! no thx to me not being able to book online on friday morning and by the time i tried to call in the afternoon it was already all booked =(&nbsp;&nbsp; To make matters worse Kill Bill 2 is also out in cinemas so that means there are two movies i want to see&nbsp;but i&nbsp;dont have&nbsp;enough time to see both.. -__-""&nbsp; Maybe ill go tomorrow and try for cancellation tickets...wish me luck! &nbsp;

      After my 2nd and last visit to the gym with my cousin today(hes going back to frankfurt tmr), my arms are again certified as "deadweight". I know i said in my last post i was supposed to go back last wednesday, but my shoulders were aching so bad i said forget it, so yea it basically took me 1 week to get over the pain.. Call me puny..a wuss..or wutever u like, but hey everyones got their own limits =P  Since this is my 2nd time there im beginning to get used to the place, i can already recognize some ppl who were there last week as well joining in for the 6.30 aerobics class. Its quite fun really watching a group of about 15 people dance around in a room with see-through glass. However, it is possible to pick out those guys who are more to the 'feminine' side, if u know what i mean.. ;) Aiyor watching these ppl do aerobics or even just having a general conversation can be quite unnerving at times. But then again i know the world out there is full of these type of ppl, and hey this is a free country right?(to a certain point..) So since my cousin is already leaving tmr, ill hve to join the club if i wanna keep this up. I suppose ill take their student membership since its not tht expensive, although i hve to be in AND out by 5pm becoz then peak hours start. Wonder if i can get a few friends along with me..? hmmm...  In school things are pretty much the same, although accounts teacher has changed all our seating during her period(im sitting at the back dammit) nothing has really changed in class. This isnt very comforting since exams are really getting closer everyday and no one seems to be noticing it(yea tht spm countdown on the sidebar serves a purpose =p). I really wry for myself sometimes if i can really get into studying b4 its too late and i find myself cramming at the last minute for all the subjects im taking. My friends arent helping. I sometimes wry more for them than myself. :D But im sure we'll all pull through nicely, i mean its not like we're entirely stupid...right..??  Well as u can see my blog has added on quite a few things. From falling snowflakes to a digital clock and tht spm countdown i mentioned earlier, im slowly but surely getting the hang of this c2pid html stuff. Pity Robyn for not being able to view our codes anymore, i wonder whats wrong..? Dnt wry i dont think its such a big problem, should be able to fix quite easily. And besides, youre the one that taught us all this in the first place, so u should know all this by now right? :D

      Yesterday i went to the gym for the first time since... since forever actually becoz i havnt been to a gym before..lolz Sweat Club in mid valley to be more precise. Well since my cousin is back in msia again and he usually works out there i thought i would tag along with him for once. Turns out to be a pretty nice place with very good facilities, not to mention one or two good looking girls along the way.. I actually predicted that i was gonna feel like i'd just been wasted or somethin, and sure enough when i woke up this morning my arms and abs were hurting like s*it. Up till now i cant move my arms around properly.. to think that im actually going back there tomorrow is not comforting. My cousin is probably gonna be merciless on me and stretch me to the limit again.. Siiighhh i guess im supposed to grin and bear it...?   In school my exam results are coming back bit by bit, and the results so far have NOT been encouraging. With my friends beating me by a lot of marks even in my stronger subjects, i hate to think what the end result is gonna be like.. Oh well i suppose theres still a bit more time to go and all hope isnt lost yet, but with each passing day the deadline just gets closer.. its like as if the walls are closing in on you... or maybe im just exagerrating a bit too much.... my "adopted" family seems to be increasing in school though(yea u know who u are), its really gonna get a bit complicated soon but hey its all good fun right? besides not like we're gonna be seeing much of each other after this year, so might as well make the most of it while we're all still around.   Watched Spiderman 2 on sunday and my overall review is two thumbs up!! Fight scenes are better then ever and peter's personal relationships are developed nicely. Only complaint i hve is about the ending.. i wish they had put the part about hob goblin a bit closer to the end so the main story wouldnt end so soon, but apart from that everything else was great. Its actually quite interesting how u can learn a few moral values even from watching a movie adapted from a comic book like spiderman.. goes to show the learning process never ends ^^   A few sports events have recently concluded too. Wimbledon tennis(Maria Sharapova RocKs!!), Euro 2004(Greece really did it..), F1(Schumacher wins again! Micheal of course..) and of course not forgetting the Malaysian Open badminton tournament where our msian men won both the singles and doubles title. But then again whos been following badminton lately anyway..? I hope not many ppl are too heartbroken over Portugal's loss to Greece, i suspect a few might hve even cried along with Ronaldo hahaha.   Finally this is to wish Joanne goodluck in her upcoming dance competition.. hope u mix some nice songs girl!! ^^

      ok im writing this while having a splitting headache which is refusing to go away.. just one of the things thats making my day worse...  my first bad decision of the day was made at 1.00am this morning when i decided to go to sleep. I should hve gone much earlier so i wouldnt be feeling so sh*tty right now (not to mention my stupid headache). The other bad decision was actually deciding to wake up for school today. If i had known what was going to happen in school today i wouldnt hve bothered dragging myself out of my cool and comfortable bed. What happened in school today u ask? well basically NOTHING happened. No lessons, No new exam marks, and No teachers for crying out loud. I cant believe my chinese teacher actually didnt come to school, and my bm and sej teachers didnt even teach anythin today. I was so bored i actually ended up reading the latest issue of the Seventeen mag.. just goes to show how desperate i was. This was definitely NOT my ideal way of spending 6 hours of my life. About 10 people were smarter than me - they didnt turn up for school today! Why cant these people tell me when theyre going to miss school so i can make plans to spend more time with my bed..??  well looks like Greece is playing Portugal in the final on monday morning. I must say i thought Czech Republic would go through considering they were in better form throughout the tournament. But now i guess on paper it should be Portugal winning the final, although i hve a strong suspicion Greece might just pull off another giant-killing feat like what theyve been doing since the start of the competition...  Bets Anyone??   Turns out im going to see spiderman with my parents on sunday so it looks like i dont hve to drag any of my friends out after all. Ive heard from some that its actually quite boring, but hey thats probably the best show out now. Waiting in line behind Spiderman is King Arthur which is due out on the 15th i think. Starring in that show is none other than Keira Knightley!! This is gonna be one movie i dont want to miss....

      Before i begin this post i wanna apologize for the lack of updates around here. people hve been reminding me about how long its been since my last post and how its due for an update. Well i suppose i better make a few things clear. firstly, i do not intend to make this blog a daily affair and have never thought of it that way. This blog was made to highlight only the meaningful/wonderful/sad/surprising/agonizing/once-in-a-lifetime things that happen in my life. of course such things do not happen everyday so therefore please do not expect updates that often. I most certainly do not intend to make this blog a daily diary where i crap about what ive been doing everyday. if u really want me to do that, then tell me and i might make another blog just for that. =P  Last Sunday i went with my parents to see a musical entitled  Do You Hear The People Sing?  it wasnt actually really a musical, more like a medley featuring songs from a variety of broadway musicals. I went there for a particular song from the broadway musical  Joseph and His Technicolour Dreamcoat  which i used to love when i was a kid. Even though i knew what to expect when i went there, it really surprised me that i had forgotten so many of the songs i used to watch and listen to back in London. watching this show certainly brought back long forgotten memories which thx God were not totally erased from my mind. It really pains me to realize that i have not remembered much about the first seven years of my life spent living in England, whether it be about school, my old house or watching musicals like these. Of course i still remember little bits and pieces of what life was like over there but not to the extent that some people expect me to. After watching the show, i not only refreshed my memory about joseph and his dreamcoat but also other forgotten musicals like  Phantom Of The Opera, Grease  and others. When i got back home i went straight to kazaa and started searching for all the songs, not to mention the lyrics as well. ahh what wonderful memories it all brings back now....  Of course watching the show wasnt the only memorable thing that happened that night. Before the show me and my dad went to the burger king near the masjid jamek lrt station to have a bite since we didnt have enough time to eat dinner. When we were walking back, we saw this Kembara stopped by the side of the road with 2 parents frantically running around trying to clean up something. later we realized their baby had done a poo-poo in the back of the car and they were really looking like they had a big job on their hands. It was quite amusing watching the dad holding a box of tissues while the mum was wiping some sort of substance off the baby(and maybe the car seat...) As if that wasnt enough, just a few meters down the road we were passing by this taxi which had stopped behind a row of cars waiting for the traffic light to turn green. Suddenly the backdoor flew open and the passenger inside started vomiting right onto the road. I hate to imagine what it would have been like if the taxi had been moving and the guy at the back couldnt hold it in any longer... EwWwWww...  The taxi driver sitting in front certainly wasnt looking happy though. i suppose no one would be happy if your passenger suddenly has to unload all his food from his stomach just when hes riding in your cab. but still the driver should be happy he didnt throw up all over his car seat. THAT would have been a major problem. i really hope the driver didnt kick him out of the cab. knowing malay drivers, thats probably what they would do to an indian behaving like that(no offense). So in the space of 20 meters i saw shit come out from both ends of a human being - front and back. Boy tht must have been my lucky day. =D  To end this post, im gonna post the lyrics  from the musical Joseph and His Technicolour Dreamcoat.   Any Dream Will Do - Jason Donovan  I closed my eyes Drew back the curtain To see for certain What I thought I knew Far far away Someone was weeping But the world was sleeping Any dream will do  I wore my coat With golden lining Bright colours shining Wonderful and new And in the east The dawn was breaking The world was waking Any dream will do  A crash of drums, a flash of light My golden cloak flew out of sight The colours faded into darkness I was left alone  May I return To the beginning The light is dimming And the dream is too The world and I We are still waiting Still hesitating Any dream will do......

      Arrgghh...i cant believe my shoes have been stolen by a stupid thief !! To think someone actually climbed over my gate and came in and stole my pair of shoes.. ONLY my pair of shoes. not my dads shoes or my mums shoes, but MY shoes. well i must say that my dad doesnt keep his shoes outside, so there was no chance of his shoes being stolen, but still!! its not nice to just wake up one day and find your shoes missing from the shoe rack. but even then, that guy must have pretty big feet if he wants to steal size 9 shoes...  It all happened yesterday afternoon when i was going out with my parents. i had skipped church in the morning so i didnt have to wear my shoes then. only when we were walking out the door and i couldnt find my shoes did i ask my mum. The conversation went something like :-  "Mum, where are my shoes?"  "arent they there?"  "Where?"  "On the shoe rack or on the floor...i dunno."  "No theyre not on the shoe rack or on the floor."  "What?? How can they be not there? Maybe its under your dads car." And so dad moves his car away only to discover they are NOT under his car, therefore proving beyond any reasonable doubt that there have been thieves in the house and they stole MY shoes. The worse part is, it had to have happened sometime saturday night because i still wore it out that night. Trouble is, i stayed up till 3am that night and i never noticed anything wrong. To think some stupid idiot might have climbed in while i was sitting comfortably here really irks me. not for my own safety, but for the fact that i might have just happened to go downstairs and catch him in the act. i really wonder what would happen then.. hmmm........... i hope he didnt think he was stealing a pair of expensive designer shoes though. that pair which he took actually came from china with a price tag of 90 ren men bi, which works out to be about 50 ringgit. =D It did look expensive because the logo on it looked like reebok or somethin..but i assure u it was nothing more than some local brand. Ahh the chinese, ever the best at copying others.... =P  Well a few other things have been happening lately, like the death of that form 1 student from my school. I must say its pretty sad and tragic to hear about a father killing his 3 kids and then taking his own life. 4 lives gone in the space of what..? half an hour? i remember seeing a small commotion outside block A after school on friday when the news had reached us. but i didnt know what had happened till i asked someone else online later. its really funny how everyone likes to speculate and come up with ideas as to why the dad did this or why he did that, or how could he think of ever going into heaven or whatever after killing off his 3 kids, or what the mum must be going through right now. To me whats done is done and it has to be accepted like everything else that happens in this world. besides, this is probably just an isolated case which happened only because the father lost his mind after fearing too much that he would lose custody of his children. but in the end ill just repeat one of my dads favourite lines "if its your time to go, you go." yea i know it sounds a bit harsh or crude, but hey thats life, if God decides he wants your life back, who are you to stop him?  well thats all im gonna blog for now..there are other things i could add in but im just too tired to write anymore not to mention im feeling a bit sick too. So GoodNight Everyone.
