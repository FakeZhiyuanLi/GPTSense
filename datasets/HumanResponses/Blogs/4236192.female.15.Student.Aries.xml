                                                                  Chapter 1 A separate peace begins when Gene Forrester visits a place that he has neglected for fifteen years. He returns to Devon school in New Hampshire, where he spent the better part of his boyhood. While visiting, nostalgia has its way with him as he reflects upon memories made within the walls of the school. Two specific places stand out in his mind, and he decides to go and visit them. The first place he visits is a marble staircase. As he stands at the base of the staircase, with the image of a moon scraped into the marble, his once worn memories begin to come back to him. He steps away from the marble and leaves, walking to his second spot. Despite bad weather, he finds his destination. A huge oak tree, standing distinct among many of the same. Once a place feared by Gene, this tree is now just a statue of his adolescence, pitied upon for its state. As he walks back to shelter, the reader shares a sense of peace with the man, finally coming to grips with his past. Gene flashes back to his childhood, standing at the base of the tree with his best friend Finny and 3 other boys. The tree is humongous. But there is not a doubt in Finny’s mind that the boys could climb it with ease. However, the other boys aren’t as sure. All of the boys are attending Devon school’s first summer session to prepare for World War II. The other boys doubt that the stunt is possible, so to prove them wrong, Finny jumps out of the tree and plunges into the water below. Gene follows. This act is a flawless example of the effect that Finny has upon Gene. After Gene’s jump, the other boys refuse, and they head inside. As they walk inside, Finny and the other boys begin to wrestle, although Gene is worried about whether they will be late for dinner. After the games, dinner, and goodnights, Finny and Gene return to their dorm to go to sleep.                                                  Chapter 2 Upon waking up and going to breakfast, Gene and Finny are confronted by Mr. Prud’homme about their absence at dinner the night before. When asked, Finny quickly provides a long, elaborate, and satisfying story. Gene tells him of how his antics were inspired by preparation.  After lying to Mr. Prud'homme, the two go back to their room where Finny puts on a pink shirt. He claims that, since there is no flag to show, he will wear this bright shirt to represent a bombing in Europe.  When Finny walks out into the public, he is confronted by a teacher about his shirt. He launches into another elaborate story about the significance of his shirt, and is allowed to wear it.  Gene is amazed at how Finny could get away with anything. Interrogations and near escapes flurry about the evening, and Gene begins to resent Finny. As they leave, Finny suggests that they go back to the river and tree. They swim for a bit, and Finny tells Gene to jump out again. As he is standing on the branch off of which he is to leap, he begins to fall over. Finny quickly stablizes him.  As a result, Gene’s resentment towards Finny grows.                                                             Chapter 3             The boys start a club surrounding the tree jumping, It is quite a success. Gene begins to worry and resent Finny even more as the days pass. He does whatever he’s told. Finny is a God to most of the students at the school. Being the King Midas clone that he is, he invents a game called Blitzball, and It becomes a popular sport among the students. Gene reflects upon this fact, as the game is still played to this day. One day, Finny decides that he is going to break a swimming record simply because he can. The record had been carved in stone, and after a seconds debate, Finny breaks the record. Gene insists upon making it official, but Finny refuses. Finny’s silence made him only more respected among the boys. The school’s way, getting them all ready for war, gets in the way of Gene's friendship with Finny and confuses him as he tries to understand this behavior. Finny suggests that they go to the beach, and despite the rules, Gene agrees. Upon arriving, they dive into the water immediately and Gene is overpowered by the strength of the waves, so he sits on the shore watching Finny play in the water. Then they have dinner at a hot dog stand along the Boardwalk, and everyone stares at Finny’s tan body. Then, they drink a few beers at a bar. Before sleep, Finny tells Gene that he is his best friend. Despite his wishes to reply earnestly, his wall of resentment has grown too high for that.                                                                         Chapter 4             Gene wakes up on the beach before Finny, and proceeds to watch his first sunrise. He is revived by the sunrise, but is eager to get back to school due to a trigonometry test in a few hours Finny finally wakes up and is carefree. They swim, and ride their bikes back home. Gene fails the test, yet continues to play with Finny and co.  Later, while studying, Gene decides that Finny is distracting him on purpose, and labels him as an enemy. To show him up, he studies harder and longer. Though, he still attends meetings to keep Finny from growing suspicious. As the two spend more time together, Gene’s suspicions grow larger and larger. Once, while studying, Finny tries to get Gene to come out to the tree to jump. Though he wants to study, he goes anyways. The pair mount the tree, and as Finny walks out to the edge, Gene shakes the branch that Finny is standing on. He falls out of the tree, hitting the ground full force. After this, Gene plunges into the water below. This shows that Finny was pleased with his actions, and felt as though he had avenged his independence.                                                                         Chapter 5             Finny is sent to the nurse, to recover. In Finny’s absence, Gene sits in the quiet of his room, pondering what he has done. He is partially happy, but mostly regretful. He tries on Finny’s clothes, and marvels at the grandiose feeling evoked when he tries on the pink shirt. Since Finny is injured, he decides to take his place, in order to fill the void that has built up inside of him as a result of Finny’s perfection. The news that Finny will not be able to play sports ever again leaks out to the public. Gene is asked to visit Finny. He goes, and tries to confess to the crime, but Finny refuses to believe that his best friend would do such a thing. Summer session ends, and both boys return home for a break.  Gene is invited to Finny’s home, and stays there for a brief time period. Finny is taken out of school for a few months until his leg can heal properly.                                                                         Chapter 6             Upon returning to the school, Gene discovers that the mood of the school is completely different. Everyone’s carefree, whimsical mood had diminished to the hand of a hardened mood, represented by the season of winter. Young teachers had been sent off to fight in the war, and new students are arriving at the school. A boy rooming across from Gene’s name is Brinker Hadley. When Gene walks to the Crew House for a meeting, Quackenbush scorns him for being late. He calls Gene “maimed,” and Gene attacks him. Both students are scorned. While walking back with the headmaster, Gene is reprimanded for his behavior over the summer. All of the behavior that Finny conned him into. Since summer sports are beginning, Finny decides that since he cant play sports, Gene will have to participate in his place.                                                                         Chapter 7             After his fight, Gene goes to rinse himself off in the river’s water. While there, he decides that the once refreshing water is now disgusting and whispering the memories of Finny’s fall into his ear.  He finishes up, and goes back inside. Brinker Hadley comes into his room shortly after and accuses him of purposely tripping Finny. Gene refuses to validate this accusation and quickly denies it. To change the subject, he suggests that they go have a cigarette. Brinker agrees, and they go down to the dungeon, where Gene is again bombarded by accusations. He denies this set also, and realizes that he doesn’t even have a cigarette. He goes back upstairs. During the summer, the boys were too wrapped up in ignorant bliss to actually comprehend the reality of the war. The mood of the winter worsens, and the boys begin to realize the severity of the war at hand. The students work more, and play less (with the exception of Leper). Some of the boys resent him for his carefree attitude, while others envy it. One day, when walking back from snow shoveling, the boys see Finny in a chair, and despite their excitement, Gene is disappointed. All of his independence is sure to pass.                                                                         Chapter 8             Finny being back is a shock to Gene. Everything that he had discovered in his absence seemed to dissipate with one sight of Finny. As some time passes, Gene realizes that he finds comfort in the sight of Finny’s cast. It makes him feel superior to him. After all, Finny is dependent upon Gene for transportation around the school. Finny discovers that Gene is planning to enlist in the army, and is slightly bothered by this. Finny, still stuck in summer time mode, suggests that the two skip class. Gene agrees, and they go to the gym. Upon arrival, Finny asks Gene what sports he has signed up for. Gene tells him that he hasn’t signed up for any because they wont be able to take trips as a result of the war. Finny says that the war is just a conspiracy against fun, and Gene responds defensively.  The boys decide that Gene will participate in the Olympics with the assistance of Finny’s coaching. They begin practicing by running laps around the headmaster’s house.                                                                         Chapter 9             Gene loses the reality of the war to Finny’s optimism. He begins to believe only what he wants to believe. His once realized mind becomes a filter, veiling him to reality. Gene begins to change. Instead of being the obedient, tractable boy he’d always been, he began to think for himself and his independence has grown tall. People in the school are swayed by pamphlets, movies, and announcements, dripping with propaganda, to enlist in the army. Despite the danger and sadness that consumes the boys due to their lost friends, they still manage to joke about them. Their spirits are relatively high in a time of depression. The adventures of Finny and Gene are no longer existent, due to the condition of Finny’s leg. To raise their spirits, the school held a carnival. Instead of embracing the carnival, the boys rip it to shreds. Gene wins all of the athletic events, Finny burns a book, and the others destroy parts of the carnival.                                                                         Chapter 10             Gene goes to visit Leper in Vermont. When he steps out into the air, something about the weather is comforting. The contrast between the weather at school and the weather in the outside is symbolic. When he sees Leper, all is well at first. Then, Leper begins telling him about a twitch in his lip. Then, he begins yelling and screaming about the army and life in general. When Gene reacts oddly, Leper starts yelling at him for isolating him from the herds of “normal” people in society. The attacks become blatantly mean, and Gene attacks Leper. The fight is interrupted by the presence of Mrs. Lepellier. As Gene prepares to leave, Leper invites him for lunch, and Gene stays. After lunch, The two boys take a walk outside. Emotions fly and Gene leaves Leper out in the cold, and runs into town filled with anger.                                                                         Chapter 11             Upon arrival at the school, Gene decides that he is going to be more attentive to Finny. He is Genuinely concerned about his friend, and feels guilty for his actions, proving that he has grown as a person. He is no longer scared of people, sports, or Finny. He has matured and grown into a man. When he is asked of Leper’s condition, he replies maturely instead of just telling them all that Leper has gone crazy. During pro army speeches, Brinker confronts Gene about why he will not enlist. Brinker thinks it’s because of Finny’s arrival, and grows very jealous of Finny. During a tutoring session, Finny seems unhappy. With much conversation and acceptance, Finny finally accepts that there is a war going on. Brinker decides that he is going to investigate the fall of Finny, declaring him a casualty. Finny is oblivious, while others refuse to be. Leper finally gives Brinker the facts that he needs, and Gene is found out. Finny, once realizing that Gene had betrayed him, Finny breaks down and begins to cry, telling everyone that he doesn’t care about the accident. He runs out of the room, and as the boys recover, they hear the sound of his body falling down the marble staircase.                                                                         Chapter 12             Gene’s leg is broken again. He is sent to the hospital, again. Gene’s growth flourishes in Finny’s absence, and the other boys begin to resent Gene for ruining Finny’s life. Gene goes to visit Finny. Finny verbally assaults Gene and Gene decides to leave the room, only to return again later. Gene comes back to drop off clothes for Finny, and Finny is civil towards him. The two talk deeply of the war, and the injury. This conversation is a flawless example of Gene’s growth. Gene leaves, and revels in his new found confidence. Finny is scheduled to have an operation on his leg. When Gene talks to the doctor about the operation, he is informed that Finny has died due to a bone marrow leak. Gene is shocked beyond comprehension. He does not cry at the deathbed, nor the funeral.                                                                         Chapter 13             Life moves on at a rapid pace back at the school. The war has come, and the school will be used as a parachute field. Gene is encouraged to join forces and fight in the war. Brinker and Gene both enlist in the navy and plan to stay training in the United States for as long as possible. Emotions within Gene are very calm and reflective considering the circumstances. He remembers everything that he had done at the school, and laughs about his past and the times spent with Finny. As he walks out of the school, he decides that war is ridiculous, and peace is underrated. He has surpassed his selfishness, and grown into  a man.

He runs out of the room, and as the boys recover, they hear the sound of his body falling down the marble staircase.                                                                         Chapter 12             Gene’s leg is broken again. He is sent to the hospital, again. Gene’s growth flourishes in Finny’s absence, and the other boys begin to resent Gene for ruining Finny’s life. Gene goes to visit Finny. Finny verbally assaults Gene and Gene decides to leave the room, only to return again later. Gene comes back to drop off clothes for Finny, and Finny is civil towards him. The two talk deeply of the war, and the injury. This conversation is a flawless example of Gene’s growth. Gene leaves, and revels in his new found confidence. Finny is scheduled to have an operation on his leg. When Gene talks to the doctor about the operation, he is informed that Finny has died due to a bone marrow leak. Gene is shocked beyond comprehension. He does not cry at the deathbed, nor the funeral.

                                                                  Chapter 1 A separate peace begins when Gene Forrester visits a place that he has neglected for fifteen years. He returns to Devon school in New Hampshire, where he spent the better part of his boyhood. While visiting, nostalgia has its way with him as he reflects upon memories made within the walls of the school. Two specific places stand out in his mind, and he decides to go and visit them. The first place he visits is a marble staircase. As he stands at the base of the staircase, with the image of a moon scraped into the marble, his once worn memories begin to come back to him. He steps away from the marble and leaves, walking to his second spot. Despite bad weather, he finds his destination. A huge oak tree, standing distinct among many of the same. Once a place feared by Gene, this tree is now just a statue of his adolescence, pitied upon for its state. As he walks back to shelter, the reader shares a sense of peace with the man, finally coming to grips with his past. Gene flashes back to his childhood, standing at the base of the tree with his best friend Finny and 3 other boys. The tree is humongous. But there is not a doubt in Finny’s mind that the boys could climb it with ease. However, the other boys aren’t as sure. All of the boys are attending Devon school’s first summer session to prepare for World War II. The other boys doubt that the stunt is possible, so to prove them wrong, Finny jumps out of the tree and plunges into the water below. Gene follows. This act is a flawless example of the effect that Finny has upon Gene. After Gene’s jump, the other boys refuse, and they head inside. As they walk inside, Finny and the other boys begin to wrestle, although Gene is worried about whether they will be late for dinner. After the games, dinner, and goodnights, Finny and Gene return to their dorm to go to sleep.                                                  Chapter 2 Upon waking up and going to breakfast, Gene and Finny are confronted by Mr. Prud’homme about their absence at dinner the night before. When asked, Finny quickly provides a long, elaborate, and satisfying story. Gene tells him of how his antics were inspired by preparation.  After lying to Mr. Prud'homme, the two go back to their room where Finny puts on a pink shirt. He claims that, since there is no flag to show, he will wear this bright shirt to represent a bombing in Europe.  When Finny walks out into the public, he is confronted by a teacher about his shirt. He launches into another elaborate story about the significance of his shirt, and is allowed to wear it.  Gene is amazed at how Finny could get away with anything. Interrogations and near escapes flurry about the evening, and Gene begins to resent Finny. As they leave, Finny suggests that they go back to the river and tree. They swim for a bit, and Finny tells Gene to jump out again. As he is standing on the branch off of which he is to leap, he begins to fall over. Finny quickly stablizes him.  As a result, Gene’s resentment towards Finny grows.                                                             Chapter 3             The boys start a club surrounding the tree jumping, It is quite a success. Gene begins to worry and resent Finny even more as the days pass. He does whatever he’s told. Finny is a God to most of the students at the school. Being the King Midas clone that he is, he invents a game called Blitzball, and It becomes a popular sport among the students. Gene reflects upon this fact, as the game is still played to this day. One day, Finny decides that he is going to break a swimming record simply because he can. The record had been carved in stone, and after a seconds debate, Finny breaks the record. Gene insists upon making it official, but Finny refuses. Finny’s silence made him only more respected among the boys. The school’s way, getting them all ready for war, gets in the way of Gene's friendship with Finny and confuses him as he tries to understand this behavior. Finny suggests that they go to the beach, and despite the rules, Gene agrees. Upon arriving, they dive into the water immediately and Gene is overpowered by the strength of the waves, so he sits on the shore watching Finny play in the water. Then they have dinner at a hot dog stand along the Boardwalk, and everyone stares at Finny’s tan body. Then, they drink a few beers at a bar. Before sleep, Finny tells Gene that he is his best friend. Despite his wishes to reply earnestly, his wall of resentment has grown too high for that.                                                                         Chapter 4             Gene wakes up on the beach before Finny, and proceeds to watch his first sunrise. He is revived by the sunrise, but is eager to get back to school due to a trigonometry test in a few hours Finny finally wakes up and is carefree. They swim, and ride their bikes back home. Gene fails the test, yet continues to play with Finny and co.  Later, while studying, Gene decides that Finny is distracting him on purpose, and labels him as an enemy. To show him up, he studies harder and longer. Though, he still attends meetings to keep Finny from growing suspicious. As the two spend more time together, Gene’s suspicions grow larger and larger. Once, while studying, Finny tries to get Gene to come out to the tree to jump. Though he wants to study, he goes anyways. The pair mount the tree, and as Finny walks out to the edge, Gene shakes the branch that Finny is standing on. He falls out of the tree, hitting the ground full force. After this, Gene plunges into the water below. This shows that Finny was pleased with his actions, and felt as though he had avenged his independence.                                                                         Chapter 5             Finny is sent to the nurse, to recover. In Finny’s absence, Gene sits in the quiet of his room, pondering what he has done. He is partially happy, but mostly regretful. He tries on Finny’s clothes, and marvels at the grandiose feeling evoked when he tries on the pink shirt. Since Finny is injured, he decides to take his place, in order to fill the void that has built up inside of him as a result of Finny’s perfection. The news that Finny will not be able to play sports ever again leaks out to the public. Gene is asked to visit Finny. He goes, and tries to confess to the crime, but Finny refuses to believe that his best friend would do such a thing. Summer session ends, and both boys return home for a break.  Gene is invited to Finny’s home, and stays there for a brief time period. Finny is taken out of school for a few months until his leg can heal properly.                                                                         Chapter 6             Upon returning to the school, Gene discovers that the mood of the school is completely different. Everyone’s carefree, whimsical mood had diminished to the hand of a hardened mood, represented by the season of winter. Young teachers had been sent off to fight in the war, and new students are arriving at the school. A boy rooming across from Gene’s name is Brinker Hadley. When Gene walks to the Crew House for a meeting, Quackenbush scorns him for being late. He calls Gene “maimed,” and Gene attacks him. Both students are scorned. While walking back with the headmaster, Gene is reprimanded for his behavior over the summer. All of the behavior that Finny conned him into. Since summer sports are beginning, Finny decides that since he cant play sports, Gene will have to participate in his place.                                                                         Chapter 7             After his fight, Gene goes to rinse himself off in the river’s water. While there, he decides that the once refreshing water is now disgusting and whispering the memories of Finny’s fall into his ear.  He finishes up, and goes back inside. Brinker Hadley comes into his room shortly after and accuses him of purposely tripping Finny. Gene refuses to validate this accusation and quickly denies it. To change the subject, he suggests that they go have a cigarette. Brinker agrees, and they go down to the dungeon, where Gene is again bombarded by accusations. He denies this set also, and realizes that he doesn’t even have a cigarette. He goes back upstairs. During the summer, the boys were too wrapped up in ignorant bliss to actually comprehend the reality of the war. The mood of the winter worsens, and the boys begin to realize the severity of the war at hand. The students work more, and play less (with the exception of Leper). Some of the boys resent him for his carefree attitude, while others envy it. One day, when walking back from snow shoveling, the boys see Finny in a chair, and despite their excitement, Gene is disappointed. All of his independence is sure to pass.                                                                         Chapter 8             Finny being back is a shock to Gene. Everything that he had discovered in his absence seemed to dissipate with one sight of Finny. As some time passes, Gene realizes that he finds comfort in the sight of Finny’s cast. It makes him feel superior to him. After all, Finny is dependent upon Gene for transportation around the school. Finny discovers that Gene is planning to enlist in the army, and is slightly bothered by this. Finny, still stuck in summer time mode, suggests that the two skip class. Gene agrees, and they go to the gym. Upon arrival, Finny asks Gene what sports he has signed up for. Gene tells him that he hasn’t signed up for any because they wont be able to take trips as a result of the war. Finny says that the war is just a conspiracy against fun, and Gene responds defensively.  The boys decide that Gene will participate in the Olympics with the assistance of Finny’s coaching. They begin practicing by running laps around the headmaster’s house.                                                                         Chapter 9             Gene loses the reality of the war to Finny’s optimism. He begins to believe only what he wants to believe. His once realized mind becomes a filter, veiling him to reality. Gene begins to change. Instead of being the obedient, tractable boy he’d always been, he began to think for himself and his independence has grown tall. People in the school are swayed by pamphlets, movies, and announcements, dripping with propaganda, to enlist in the army. Despite the danger and sadness that consumes the boys due to their lost friends, they still manage to joke about them. Their spirits are relatively high in a time of depression. The adventures of Finny and Gene are no longer existent, due to the condition of Finny’s leg. To raise their spirits, the school held a carnival. Instead of embracing the carnival, the boys rip it to shreds. Gene wins all of the athletic events, Finny burns a book, and the others destroy parts of the carnival.                                                                         Chapter 10             Gene goes to visit Leper in Vermont. When he steps out into the air, something about the weather is comforting. The contrast between the weather at school and the weather in the outside is symbolic. When he sees Leper, all is well at first. Then, Leper begins telling him about a twitch in his lip. Then, he begins yelling and screaming about the army and life in general. When Gene reacts oddly, Leper starts yelling at him for isolating him from the herds of “normal” people in society. The attacks become blatantly mean, and Gene attacks Leper. The fight is interrupted by the presence of Mrs. Lepellier. As Gene prepares to leave, Leper invites him for lunch, and Gene stays. After lunch, The two boys take a walk outside. Emotions fly and Gene leaves Leper out in the cold, and runs into town filled with anger.                                                                         Chapter 11             Upon arrival at the school, Gene decides that he is going to be more attentive to Finny. He is Genuinely concerned about his friend, and feels guilty for his actions, proving that he has grown as a person. He is no longer scared of people, sports, or Finny. He has matured and grown into a man. When he is asked of Leper’s condition, he replies maturely instead of just telling them all that Leper has gone crazy. During pro army speeches, Brinker confronts Gene about why he will not enlist. Brinker thinks it’s because of Finny’s arrival, and grows very jealous of Finny. During a tutoring session, Finny seems unhappy. With much conversation and acceptance, Finny finally accepts that there is a war going on. Brinker decides that he is going to investigate the fall of Finny, declaring him a casualty. Finny is oblivious, while others refuse to be. Leper finally gives Brinker the facts that he needs, and Gene is found out. Finny, once realizing that Gene had betrayed him, Finny breaks down and begins to cry, telling everyone that he doesn’t care about the accident. He runs out of the room, and as the boys recover, they hear the sound of his body falling down the marble staircase.                                                                         Chapter 12             Gene’s leg is broken again. He is sent to the hospital, again. Gene’s growth flourishes in Finny’s absence, and the other boys begin to resent Gene for ruining Finny’s life. Gene goes to visit Finny. Finny verbally assaults Gene and Gene decides to leave the room, only to return again later. Gene comes back to drop off clothes for Finny, and Finny is civil towards him. The two talk deeply of the war, and the injury. This conversation is a flawless example of Gene’s growth. Gene leaves, and revels in his new found confidence. Finny is scheduled to have an operation on his leg. When Gene talks to the doctor about the operation, he is informed that Finny has died due to a bone marrow leak. Gene is shocked beyond comprehension. He does not cry at the deathbed, nor the funeral.                                                                         Chapter 13             Life moves on at a rapid pace back at the school. The war has come, and the school will be used as a parachute field. Gene is encouraged to join forces and fight in the war. Brinker and Gene both enlist in the navy and plan to stay training in the United States for as long as possible. Emotions within Gene are very calm and reflective considering the circumstances. He remembers everything that he had done at the school, and laughs about his past and the times spent with Finny. As he walks out of the school, he decides that war is ridiculous, and peace is underrated. He has surpassed his selfishness, and grown into  a man.
