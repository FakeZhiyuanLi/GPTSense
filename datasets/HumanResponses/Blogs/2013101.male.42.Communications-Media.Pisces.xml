      My name is Bo Majors and I have had bad credit. Use my tips to update and repair your bad credit. Many bad credit files will not come off. Credit is real. Overlap bad credit files with new good credit files. More weight is placed on recent credit or less than two years old. Once your bad credit files reach two years of age they will not affect your credit as much as the new credit. Get a credit report once a year and make sure your credit and credit score is accurate.  http://www.oskie.com/equifaxtransunionexperiancredit.htm

      Saturday, July 10, 2004 Posted 2:09 PM by bobo  Different score and ranges 3 different credit report bureaus From: Mydrumms@aol.com  To: majors@oskie.com  Sent: Wednesday, April 14, 2004 1:17 PM Subject: (no subject)   urlLink Get your Free Credit Report Now   urlLink Get your Credit Report with Score Now   Hi Mr. Majors,  I found your credit site on the search engine provided by aol. Well I am looking for advice. I have been provided with effective tipe to repair the credit scores for both myself and my husband. Our credit not that bad--we each have all three scores ranging from high 500's to low 600's--however we used to be 700's at A credit. We pay our bills but sometimes I am forced to go over the 30 days mark and it has cost us our good rating. I have been trying my best to be timly with our paments since I started the dispute process.  I ordered all three reports for each of us and began disputing everything on line through each beuaru--every 30 days when I get the results I go back in and re-dsipute. While some of the negative item,s have come off--most have not, they have simply been verified and up dated with the creditor and at this rate I feel that our scores will not come up as much to get as back to A. I was wonderingif you have any suggestions that I can effectivly get help without paying a law firm? I may have to resory to writing letter, but if on-line disputes won't work, why will the letters? Please help if you can.

I am just a little confused becasue the woman I work with and her husband both divorced and got real ugly credit and she actually had to file BR- using -the link below and did everything I am doing and she had the BR removed and all other neg items and they both now have high 700's. She claims i just need to be persistant with it--she said NEVER pay anyone do it yourself for free, never have a co. try to lower payments for you etc becasue that makes it worse. Given the fact that she owns a mortgage branch and has to often help people who have ahrd time getting approved I figure it's solid advice. Take a look if you haven't seen it. I like your idea about offering a fee--has that worked for anyone you know of?? It almost sounds as if if wouldn't be legal on the end of the creditor but if it's affordable it may be worth a try.

I like your no-nonsense approach.  Question: is there a time or an area that an attorny is helpful in a rebuilding program? Does their letterhead demand respect? Can they navigate certain areas a consumer can't (threats of suits, etc.)?  Regards,  F.
