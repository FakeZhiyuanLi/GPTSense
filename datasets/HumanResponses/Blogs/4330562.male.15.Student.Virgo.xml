      It was 21th of August.It was KJ's PBSM installation.It began around 2.45 which it was behind scedule.Then the ceremony began.Nurul Huda and Diana was the MC of the day.The opening act was singing by Ying Ling and Kha Mun.They sang " What Dreams Are Made Of " originally sang by Hilary Duff.I was back stage playing the guitar for them.Wasn't really that good but it was enough.Both of them have a wonderful voice,which i was kind of stun after listening to it.After that event i think it was the roll call of each club or "unit beruniform".  There were Scout,Ranger Puteri,Interact,Bomba and of course PBSM member.The event was i can say a success,thanks 2 everyone's hard effort especially Kha Mun which was the Secretary of the KJ's PBSM club along with the help of other member.On and on the ceremony continued,event after event.There was a performance by Syed Gama and his friend along with our old friend Irwan.Irwan and Syed's friend played the guitar while Syed Gama sang the song.They were excellent guitar player and also singer.The PSBM held a FASHION show of their on.It wasn't on the event list, it was a surprise for all of us.Yinzi was one of the model,and i think she did a great job on that.After the fashion show Me and Syed Gama played the guitar while Yinzi,Yen Theng and Shain sang.They sang " My Happy Ending " by Avril Lavigne.Wasn't too bad i guess, but i knew i played wrong.But one thing was a waste, Chan Kiki's and her friends Dance which had to be cancelled last minute due to some problem they had to went through.  Another surprise was Kha Mun became the 3th MC for the day. Not long after all that kindly ask us to go out of the hall and be at the " Tapak Perhimpunan " for some game. Me,Ying Ling,Chee Hoe and Adrian didn't wanted to join because they were playing with flour and water.Yng kept forcing all of us to play but in the end she still fail to bring us in.The four of us sat out the hall chit chatting.Bor Yow then ask me,can he eat the sweets in the basket.I said why not ? it's not like there's poison in it.He still don't believe it, so i took one and ate it myself.He used me as a guinea pig.Adrian was there next to us.Well i ate the sweet and nothing happen.  Yeah that was what i thought, I sat next to Ying.And for a moment there i started singing.Singing out loud! Even Ying,Adrian and Chee Hoe laugh at my singing.It's because i can hardly speak chinese well.And i didn't know why i only san chinese song.Maybe cause their much nicer and more romantic.I sand Jay Chou song,F.I.R and F4. I only know like a phrase then i'll start humming all the way that's what made them laugh.But i didn't felt embarrass.  On and on until it was like 5 or so. The four of us were hungry and they already place the food in place but we aren't allowed to eat them until the games are over. Our teacher adviser,Pn.Marina along with the PBSM teacher Pn.Saridah and The new HM of KJ Mr.Phua.I went over to Pn.Marina and told her that i was hungry.She then told me to grab the plates and go into the hall and eat.There's still food inside which they couldn't finish.I quickly went over to Chee Hoe,Adrian and Ying and told them.We quickly took the plates and forkes and went into the hall ! They were busy playing their game and we were busy eating ! hahaha. After sometime, everything went into chaos.Everyone outside were running like free stalions running away from other people from being a target of flour and water.We were a little worried they might come in and throw at us.Me and Chee Hoe wasn't too worried as we got a BIG POT of Curry Chicken with gravy infront of us getting ready to throw at people who are going to throw at us.  They aren't that brave to come in the hall and turn it into a living hell which if they did they would have to clean it up by the end of the day.More and more people came and joined us.1st came Ah Boy with i think is his GF and then Nurul Huda and followed by Bor Yow.Pn.Marina came and join us for a chat later on.We chit chat on alot of things, jokes , gks and many more.It was fun. Not long after a long chat Kha Mun came in to find water.I passed her a glass of icy cold unsweet orange juice that taste just like water.She then drank the orange juice in seconds.She told Me and Yng that she was dehydrating, and she just ran out the hall.Me just stared at Yng and then continue chit chatting with the others.Kha Mun then came in to the hall for the 2nd time and wanted more water.We ran out of it,so she just went out the hall again.  Mitchell came in the hall and shockingly told us that Kha Mun had faint.All of us quickly went to her.She was lying down on a stone bench by the canteen at a small hut.Already there to help her was her Sir.Mitchell then use my phone to contact her sis to pick her up.Kha Mun was barely concious.All of us was kind of worried. Lucky for Kha Mun she fainted in front of Mitchell. If she would have fall on to the hard rock simen, i don't even want to think about it. Soon after her sis came and fetch her home.Kha Mun was still barely concious and barely able to walk.After all that we were waiting our parents or guardian to come and pick us up.Still in a high condition i started singing again which made them laugh till the max.They asked me to stop but i ignored them and just continued singing.Even Pn.Marina smile or laugh at me.One by one we went home, i was the last.  While waiting for my sis i talked to Pn.Marina and told her i'm high today.She told me that it was good to be high once in a while. It will enable us to release all of our stress and worries for a moment and bring us happiness.Not long later my sis came and i went home. And i guess what made me high was the sweet that i took.They must have poison the sweet.But i glad they did because it was one of the happiess day of my life.

      After that hard work of finish's Dift's and Snowy's Story my mind deicide to do something to join the Love Story Competition.It wasn't easy to think of a magnificent story nor a beautiful poem but my mind was set to write something out and this is what it have think of.  IF  If I was one of the First Class Jobs, I would do this for you. If I were one of the Knights of the Round Table, I would be your White Knight and rise whenever you are in danger. If I were the Holiest Priest, I would heal and bless whenever you need me. If I were the Wisest Wizard, I would always get you out of trouble. If I were the Assassin of Assassin, I would gracefully swing my katar for you. If I were the Greatest Hunter, I would hunt anything you want. If I were the World Famous Blacksmith, I would forge the strongest weapon for you.  If I was one of the Second Class Jobs, I would do this for you, If I were the Mightiest Crusader, I would devote my life to you. If I were the Stealthiest Rogue, I would silently take down those who harm you. If I were a Romantic Bard, I would write a lovely song for you everyday. If I were a Creative Alchemist, I would create something special for you. If I were a Powerful Monk, I would create a powerful skill and name it after you. If I were a Knowledgeable Sage, I would find an eternal youth potion for you.  If only you had given me a chance, I would prove to you. If only you cared for me, I would care back more for you. If only you had loved me, I would love you for now and always.  It's not that perfect of a poem but that's was i really can think of and i already summited for the competition.But what the heck ? i got nothing to lose if i send it.And so i did.
