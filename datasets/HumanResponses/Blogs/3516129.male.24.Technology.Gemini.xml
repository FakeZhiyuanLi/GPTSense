        I don't know if you can catch ESPN in the PI, but they're airing the annual   urlLink  Scripps National Spelling Bee   . I know, it does sound weird that ESPN has included this kinda thing in their programming but people shouldn't be so surprised after they started airing poker games.  Anyways, I was sitting on the couch checking out one of the final rounds. This awkward-looking Indian kid with a complementary strange name and stoic demeanor,   urlLink  Akshay Buddiga    steps up to the mike. He recieves his word to spell, which is '  urlLink  alopecoid   .' After repeating the word a few times, our man Akshay seems to be deep in thought.  Then it happens. His eyes flutter and begin to grow wider as if he's shocked or something. His body begins to sway to his left a bit. Almost imperceptibly, Akshay begins a slow descent to the ground- drawing gasps from the crowd (probably stifled snickers, too). Further replays (thank you ESPN!) show that he does absolutely nothing to slow his fall. No flailing arms, nothing. You know those videos where you see loggers chopping down trees? Akshay looked just like that. Well, almost like that. Imagine a tree with glasses and prematurely developed facial hair.  At the expense of his embarrassment however, I was left with a classic moment...one of the most hilarious sights I've ever seen. I would pay to relive that shit again.

         Current Location : I'm in scenic Lansing, Michigan visiting my girl Michelle.   Job Status : After a brief stint at Google, I'm working as a Game Tester at Visual Concepts. Those familiar with video games will know that they're the producers responsible for the 2K3 series of sports games. After a few weeks working here, I've decided that this isn't the exact industry I want to learn about.  Oh, and I'm sure many of you out there think that testing video games is the perfect job. This isn't exactly the case. While video games are ideal for an hour or two of mindless enjoyment, the fun can wear off when you're stuck playing them hour after hour after hour, etc.  I'm lucky that my coworkers make my job bearable. Well, getting baked before work doesn't hurt either. Hehehehehehe... (stoned laughter).   Game Plan  (tentative of course): 1. Apply for grad school to study advertising. 2. Take the GRE. 3. ?  To be Continued!

      Oh man...Rina's got me into Blog-land. You know, I honestly have never felt drawn to blogging. I once tried (and failed) to maintain one a few months ago. It lasted exactly one post.  I guess I can attribute my lack of interest in blogging to my personality. In general, I am a pretty introverted dude. Well, that's not entirely true according to the Myers-Briggs test which you all can take  urlLink here .  I last took this test in high school and on the 'Introvert/Extrovert' chart, I barely scored into 'Extrovert.' It would be interesting to see what I would get on that shit at this point in my life but I digress!  My point is, I never really saw the point of keeping an online diary (which is what a blog is basically) for all eyes to read. In my opinion, it would be much more interesting for the readers' sake to fictionalize things.   But who knows...maybe this little experiment could prove to be fun and productive (?). Maybe I will catch onto the whole blog craze. Maybe I will find it to be a cathartic experience to post my inner thoughts, dreams, and desires online for random people to obsessively pore over. Maybe...  Um. Nah. Fuck it. Let's have a little fun. Sit back, relax, take a long drag off your  urlLink L  and enjoy my random-ass ramblings.

           Messing around with adobe during with my free time, results to this kinda shit. Man, you gotta love that photoshop. My staff from the office passed by behind me while I was tinkering with the graphics. And not knowing the muppets, she asked "Do you even like that?" with the most puzzled, grossed out look on her face. It was like she had just seen the ugliest creature ever. And to think that these are endearing characters from 2 popular kiddy shows. In response, I just gave a sneeky smile and said "yes~" Anyways, hope she doesn't see the resemblance there.

         It's as simple as something that nobody knows  That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes…  …His dreams are like commercials  But her dreams are picture perfect and  Our dreams are so related though they're often underestimated    I can’t get enough of Jack Johnson. His music’s got incredible vibe and it’s such a great bluesy, folk, tropical mix of sounds. I don’t know if that’s what he intended, cuz I don’t read much on his bio or anything. What strikes me more is his lyrical sense. It’s uncomplicated yet profound, whimsical, and sometimes even funny. Like this one called “Bubble Toes”. How the hell do you come out comparing the size of one’s eyes and toes? His song is so full of contradictions and things that don’t add up, but somehow it does make sense. Sort of like myself, ‘walking paradox’ as I always say.   On a side note, the whole ‘bubble toes’ bit got me thinking about my defects. The stuff I call my defects: lazy left eye, animal teeth, flinstone toes, cracking knees, and the list goes on. Although ‘defect’ sounds a bit harsh, it really isn’t that bad.   eg. Animal teeth – as in that orange drum-beating freak of nature of a muppet – Animal. Flinstone toes – equal length toes like that of Fred Flinstone.  A lot of these stuff were pointed out to me by friends and were baptized with matching weird names. They sound a whole lot freakish when enumerated like that, but I actually like them quirks now. It gives me character I guess...   Now I've set myself up sounding like some hideous monster. Oh man.

       I'm scheduled to leave for the US this Friday, so I’m making my travel arrangements. Being a travel consultant, this is a cinch to me. But what is painstakingly frustrating is the fact that I’m traveling on award tickets. Yes, the freaking perks of the job. Seriously, it’s not what it seems.  Anyone who’s traveled on a non-revenue ticket knows how impossible it is to get confirmation on these award ticket bookings. You think that the airline would give you credit for flying enough to earn those miles. I'm talking to a Northwest Airlines agent as we speak and I still can't get the flight that I wanted. Plus I can't even get my return flight confirmed on PAL, so I'm kinda screwed if I don't get back within this month. Frequent Flyer programs are the biggest rip-offs!!!  Rants aside, I'm glad to be able to visit some really good friends and family. Plus, I haven't been there since '99. This trip will be a long-ass trip, but definitely worth all the hassle. I'm gonna eat a whole lot, soak up the energy of the city, spend quality time with people over there and just relax. At this point in my life, nothing can beat that... not unless it’s a trip around the world or winning at the lottery.  On a side note, I caught Akshay on the CBS Today News the other day. He apparently got to spell the word after coming out of his black-out. Kudos to him for that. But still, what a dork...

       A single shadow creeping in the night… Hushed footsteps tip-toeing down the hall… down the stairs… into the kitchen… Doors opening/closing, utensils clinking, sounds of rustling, gulping, gobble gobble munch munch munch… TV blasting till the brink of dawn…  This is the aftermath of my 2 week hiatus.  After taking a break from Manila, flying off to  urlLink New York   then to  urlLink San Francisco  , I’m left with my zoned out, trés heavy, jet-lagged self. It’s not insomnia that haunts me. It’s having to wake up around 3:00 a.m. and not being able to sleep that kills me. As if my eye-baggin’ zombie self isn’t bad enough, getting the munchies at odd hours is just dietary suicide. The other night I just murdered 3  urlLink Krispy Kreme French Crullers   in a span of 5 minutes. I can’t go on like this… I really can’t… more like I shouldn’t.   What’s up with midnight snacks anyway? Why does it taste so good, and why do you get such a strong craving for certain things? I was watching some medical documentary on  urlLink Discovery channel   at 4 in the morning and still got this urge for a deluxe cheese burger, guacamole with chips, and chocolate.  Gotta get it together!!

       urlLink    .pls. be sweet. keep it neat.&nbsp; urlLink     I know, I know. The posting well on my part has dried up as of late. Apart from the dreadful constant that is being a game tester, it's been a whirlwind around here. Rina was nice enough to stay for awhile and just a few days later, Shelly came home from school.   Having Rina here for about a week was fun as hell. We both had a great time and shared dozens of laughs (as you can see in her detailed recap!).

          Recalling an incident in San Francisco (dated 6.20.2004.)     It was 2:30 in the morning, Vince and I were wide awake, bored and thought of nothing better to do but to seek for herbal mood enhancers. Mind you, I really don’t do this often. Just wanted to get that out in the open before anything else. Anyways, we step outside his house just to face the cold gust of mid-June summer. (Why is it so friggin’ cold still? You call this summer, goddamnit!?) We light the baby up and each take a slow drag. We laughed mindlessly, spat profusely, and talked hysterical non-sense. As we sat there and did our shit, we encountered a strange bunch. (Maybe not too strange, just a tad bit)   1) Huff, puff and away  Some old man, walked up to us and said “D’ya haaave ay sheegarit” in an incoherent slur. In translation, it meant “Do you have a cigarette?” which is a simple question in itself. At that moment, I actually thought he was speaking some Japanese dialect. To this we just shook our heads and kept our mouths shut. Mystery man in dire need of a smoke left never getting his yosi . It was only when he walked away that we noticed his slight limp.   2) All in the army  Next, was this Chinese (?) middle-aged woman walking “military style” with arms and legs straight, raised to the heavens. Ok I’m exaggerating about the ‘heavens’ bit, but really, you could almost hear the ‘left, right, left’ chanting in the background. How can a person be so uptight and rigid, when you think you're not being watched? (Well technically we were watching her, but it was done discretely) Anyways, who are we to presume what kind of stuff she's got in her head. It just looked fuckin’ weird.   3) Melons, I swear    Another random man passed by, this time with a more bizarre-looking walk then the other. If you could see the picture, he looked like he was walking with melons in his hands. He just happened to grip it in the oddest way. This low-tech graphic doesn’t even capture the strangeness of this man’s posing.  Now that I’ve written all these down, it actually doesn’t seem as funny as it did before. When you’re stoned, even the most mundane things become hysterically amusing. But this was nothing compared to the events that were to follow.  Once we were done, I jumped off whatever I was sitting on to get my feet back on the ground. A miscalculation led me to a clumsy fall, as I thought I was jumping at least 3 ft. high when in reality it was more like a foot or less. Dumbo me… After that display of stupidity, I slid my toes in my slip-ons and was ready to go, when suddenly, felt the most yucky, slimy substance in my shoe. I yelled, punched, kicked Vince and accused him of spitting in my shoe. Then I hopped on one foot and quickly made my way to the room to get that mysterious gunk of my foot. As I threw the shoe off, a slug flew out and landed on the floor. How horrible!! In the next second, I dashed to the bathroom, opened the faucet and was desperate to erase that slimy feel off my foot.  As Vince recalls that moment, he said I had turned into a woman in rampage. I was throwing stuff at him, intensely pressing on the shampoo bottle and scrubbing my foot sooo hard. When we got back to the couch, that snot-like slug still had the will power to move 3 inches from where it landed. Man, that stuff was  DISGUSTING!!  The word 'gross' doesn’t even come close to what I experienced in that few seconds. 2 weeks has passed, but I can still remember the texture of it through my socks.   HATE HATE HATE SLUGS!!

       I had an interview last week with a recruiter for a tech job agency. To clarify, my co-worker Rich told me about a QA localization job opening in San Fran. Wow. It's funny but I think I might have made shit even more confusing. Alright, for the non-videogame industry savvy, QA is just a fancy word for game tester and 'localization' is basically making sure a game produced in a foreign country (in this case, Japan) translates well into English.  We'd really like to avoid any of   urlLink  this    happening. Hehe.  By the way, I work at Visual Concepts Inc. which is now known as   urlLink  ESPN Videogames   . They make produce titles that compete with (and usually best)   urlLink  Electronic Arts'   .  Needless to say, this job opportunity would be perfect for me right now as I'm trying to sort out going back to school for a second degree. First off, it's much closer than San Rafael. Secondly, I would be working 'normal' hours as opposed to my current jacked up schedule (going from 5:30 pm - 1:30 am, Saturday to Wednesday...nuts, I know). Thirdly, localization work seems like something that would come naturally to me. I have a keen eye for grammatical errors, syntax shit, and typos as a result of my English background. Oh and to top off the list of positives, it pays more!  Anyways, the interview went really well. My recruiter was very nice. Disarmingly nice even. It was the first interview I've had that seemed like a friendly chat if nothing else. The grammar test she administered was pretty easy as well. Dude, the situation described in the test dialogue was two guys with gay porn names (John Michaels and John Stevens) fighting over who owned a duck. Go figure.  After chatting with her, I discovered that the company I'd be working for would be   urlLink  Sega   , which is ironic as fuck. See, Visual Concepts is a developer for Sega. Oh well- I guess there would be no love lost between the two parties since I'm basically working for the same company. Now I'm slated to meet with the Sega hiring dude on Wednesday. Wish me luck!

        [Disclosure] I’m not looking for solutions. I just want to let out some steam.   Indeed, there is a fine line between love and hate. As of late, I’ve been desperately hanging onto the edge of love, cuz it’s so easy to slip into the dominion of hate. More than just hatred for others, but deep hatred for myself.   Each day the demon in me keeps lurking. Desperately trying to find its way to come out. It peeks through my expressions, my words, my actions. One can easily detect its ferocity through my ever gleaming eyes. Often, I try really hard to bite my tongue and resist the urge. But I just can’t help it. Its energy’s always being fueled by the growing hatred I sense; your hatred towards me that is.   You stare at me with a cold blank face. You never hear me out. &nbsp;My voice bounces back whenever I speak to you. And in spite, I let out cruel words like darts and daggers just to make it penetrate you.&nbsp; And I know it hits you hard. But what can I do, when I feel like that’s the only way you'd take me seriously. Instead of showing understanding for you (which I really do I have), I show my fangs and become a feral bitch. I know it in my heart that it actually makes matters worse, since you get offended when I become this unpleasant (what an understatement). But my head says stand up for what is right and correct, even if I have to stick it in your face. How do you ever reconcile reason and emotion? Cuz seems like I can’t at all, when it comes to this topic and I just keep falling into some deep dark pit of ugliness. &nbsp;   There is a perfect idiom for people like me in Japanese. Its called  AMA NO JAKU  wherein its literal translation is ‘Heaven’s demon.’ But what it really points to is my awkwardly defiant, almost wicked nature. I never back down when it comes to you and I keep telling myself its only because I strictly fight for the truth. I won’t comply if I don’t get a logical explanation. And I know I get so anal sometimes, but I just can’t let things slide especially when they are important matters that get massively screwed up on some stupid whim. I really don’t mean to contradict you all the time.       Bottomline is that I hate having to feel this way. I want to bask in the warmth of your unconditional love and be able to return that without expecting kindness in return. I want to be able to turn on some protective force field whenever someone starts mudslinging at me for no apparent reason. I want to be able to understand you and have you understand me as well. Above all, I just really want to be able to talk to you without any hostility between us.   Can we make that happen? Hmmm… I don’t know. Can I make that happen? I will try to control that malicious tongue and wicked eye I have. So best of luck to the demon from heaven. &nbsp;Cuz you know that demon is me.

        You often hear people say "I’m getting weird vibes…" or "Don’t you feel bad vibes?"      It is a word so loosely used in our daily lives. But what does this actually mean?Is it some instinctive gut feel, generated by past memories, experiences and stock knowledge? Or is it simply some thick figment of imagination? I believe they are neither of the two. What I do believe is that it is triggered by a sense of fear that you emit, that affects you to think on your toes instead of being attacked unaware when you’re feet are flat on the ground.      Fear of the unknown. Fear of the unexpected. Fear of facing the unprecedented. I think that it is precisely this sense of fear that creates a kind of illusion that you know something others don’t. Please bear with me here, cuz this is still a working theory. And this is not to pose that there is no such thing as a sixth sense or to even dare to negate the brilliance of instinct (at times). I guess what I’m trying to say here is that I don’t exactly believe in the kind of bad vibes you get from a person or bad vibes you get from an event that is yet to come. Least to say, not in itself that is. That’s basically pessimism doing the talking and any fraction of potential, possibility or positivism is out of the window. I really am not an optimist. But over time, I’ve realized that it is a great waste of your time and energy as well as those of others, to freak out, analyze and scrutinize every single thing to miniscule particles when it is best to think of constructive alternatives to the presenting problem. There obviously is a cause-and-effect relationship between people who analyze too much of everything and becoming a little too anal? Don’t you notice that there is the word ‘anal’ in the word ‘analyze’?    It is extremely frustrating and demeaning when a person keeps gabbing about bad vibes, without them realizing that it is precisely them that transmit the kind of negative energy on to others. Maybe the reason why they feel that certain discomfort from people is because others sense disdain from the so-called Mr. or Ms. ‘psychic’ anyway. Isn’t it that when you hate someone, the person will sense it even without you saying it? Am I right or am I right? (haha how cocky does that sound?) I’m getting too carried away in disproving this bad vibes theory.     Why is there a need to constantly size up people anyway? Why do we have to satisfy some twisted need to fill up our heads with our own versions of how people think, feel, and simply are? Why can't we just admit that we can't fully figure people out right away or even never at all? The beauty in getting to know someone is in unraveling the little mysteries day-by-day and in them being able to gradually peel off your layers as well. What's the fun in finding everything out in a second anyway, right? So lets not overassume people and things, most especially if your assumptions only lead you to a negative place.

        I'm a friggin' dimwit!!  Call me clumsy, dumb and stupid. (But only for now) I actually took time out to fix this blog and imput some add-ons like the comment box and tag board. Hehe and get this, doing it during working hours at that.  Then in a flick of second, it was all gone...all my hard work down the drain. Just because I thought of checking out other templates and trying it out on a whim.  I'll have to do it all over again.   GODDAMNIT!!?! NOW I HATE FRIDAYS!!!

        urlLink  In the True Spirit of the Games    urlLink  Athens Olympics 2004                The Nakayama’s are big Olympics & World Cup Soccer fans (more like Nakayama minus Ghetto, that is). We live for this stuff. If we could be there, we would. But the closest alternative to watching it live is catching it on the boobtube on simultaneous telecast. In the year 2001, my dad even insisted that we get a new satellite dish and tuner installed just for that, out of sheer obsession I say. And it wasn’t a simple task at all. My brother flew to Japan to purchase the gadget and we had a crew of 3 people or so install a 10 feet mesh satellite dish on our roof. This was done all in the name of live-telecast viewing of the   urlLink  2002 World Cup    held in Japan &amp; Korea. Really, nothing beats watching it live. More so, actually being there in the stadium like what my sister and I did in Saitama, Japan. Heehee ;) Now I’m crossing my fingers for the 2006 World Cup in Germany… but that’s another story.  Now to get back on the topic.  The Athens Olympics opens on the 13th of August, 2004, that’s in a mere 2 days. The first match of the whole tournament actually kicks off in a matter of hours though. - Women's Soccer Match: Japan vs. Sweden. Unfortunately, we have yet to hear much about the Olympics here in the Philippines. Only recently did   urlLink  NBN    confirm that they will air the Olympics (crap reception btw) It’s a once in 4 years world event and still so many things haven’t been ironed out. There are just so many issues surrounding this event, like overgrown budget, fear of terrorism, insufficient accommodations in Athens, bleh food in Athens et all. It would be a miracle if this one goes on without a hitch. So lets pray for a miracle people. We don't want a repeat of that  urlLink tragic massacre  during the Munich Olympics in 1972.  Game viewing and cheering aside, what I love about the Olympics is the   urlLink  ‘Celebrate Humanity’   ad campaigns. Both Summer &amp; Winter series follow this theme and they usually are such inspiring pieces. Sometimes I even get misty-eyed, when I catch those captions with struggling athletes that overcome their challenges, the tears, smiles and all. The narration, the music, the images, all these combined with the solemn ending of the ‘Celebrate Humanity’ tag on a blank background. I don’t know whether it ranks high up in the Cannes, Lions, or whatever Ad Award giving body, but it sure motivated me to want to get into advertising. The Olympics and UNICEF ads were the prime instigators of my love for advertising. Well, it is a sad fact now, that studying advertising in college has made me lose that passion for an advertising career…  What I do wish for now is that they air more ads here in Manila, cuz we’re seriously being deprived of anything to do with the Olympics.    urlLink  Samples of Celebrate Humanity Campaign (that they obviously don’t show here.. hmph!?)
