      Yeah, I'm at school posting. Actually, I'm supposed to be typing up the Gospel for our graduation mass, but I'm a sassy girl. Today is the last day of school. We haven't done much except practice walking in church, receiving our diploma, and walking out. We also were singing "Lean on Me," which is our class song. I love it. Eventually I'll post the lyrics on the blog.   I also had a big mix up ordering pizza for our class, but it is all good now. Papa John's is just the epiphany of a rita. Anyway, I shall go, for I don't want to get in trouble.

      "In 1984 Argentintian plice found a set of bones belonging to a missing 19-year-old, Carlos Sanchez, beneath a Buenos Aires building which was used by devil worshippers. The occupants explained that they had phoned an order for pizzas, but after an interminable delay had decided to eat the dilivery boy instead."                     -The Little Book of Bad Taste Yes, that probably the most interesting part of my day. At school we had tests and cleaned our cubbyholes in the presence of a retired teacher aka Mrs. Seabitch. We also did a fun art project with lines, which amused Cate and I but not Francis and Yetty so much. ONE MORE DAY LEFT AT MY STUPID SCHOOL!

      Yeah, blogger was being a butt, so I have a new website. This is one of the posts I made yesterday on my other now deleted blog.  (the title was Here's Johnny for this post)The Shining is actually a very scary movie. That is beside the point, even though I have none. I am bored and talking online to Cate and Francis. We are all being a bunch of lovers (it's not what you think). And now Francis is gone, and I am talking to Cate on one of her multiple screen names. She is trying to see how many screen names she is allowed to have, if you haven't already heard.  T onight Cate, Francis, Betty, Laurana, and I are going to go watch fireworks at Celebrate DePere to much of my excitement. Except, we are taking the cheap way and are going down to Zesty's and watching down by the river so we don't have to pay twelve dollars to get in. I'd rather spend my mula on ice cream. Yummy.  We decided to go to Raising Helen before the fireworks, and it was very good. Franny and Laurana's sister and mom cried at the end, although I didn't think it was the least bit sappy. But I never cry during 1. movies or television, for the exception of the season finale of The OC. There were some familiar people in the movie, like Maureen from Center Stage and that little girl in Remember the Titans that hated dolls. It might have been a coincident, but they played "Na na na na Hey Hey-ey Kiss Her Good-bye" during the movie. Then, someone moaned at a remotely funny part, and Cate and I started laughing so hard we cried. It was quite interesting and I'm sure everyone in the theater was about to strangle us. And there was also some very loud employees emptying the garbage that were saying, "let's jump over," and "let's go over to number six." Cate, Betty, and I kept trying to check who it was by standing on our seats.   I am also posting a lot because it is the first day my blog, and I won't be able to post when I am in Florida for ten days. So, enjoy it while you can, even though that only includes Cate.

      Today wasn't much more interesting than the rest of my Memorial weekend days. I went shopping with Cate, Franny, and Betty, which was very fun. We all bought flip-flops at Old Navy, because there was a 2 for $5 sale. I also ended up with a light purple skort, and I am very excited about it. I think I shall wear on the plane to Florida.  But before I went shopping, my mom, sister, and went to Barnes and Noble. I bought One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest for summer reading for Notre Dame. Then I came home and realized I had that we owned that book along with at least five more from the list. So I went back with my mom and exchanged it for the Little Book of Bad Taste, which is very hilarious. It has a bunch a weird facts like: "A  recipe  once favorted by Idian prices involved the following: take one sparrow and stuff it inside a quail. Stuff the quail into a sand grouse, and the sand grouse inside a chicken. Stuff the chicken inside a peacock, the peacock inside a goat, and the goat inside a whole camel. Place the camel in a hole in the ground, then steam." The  book also has the top ten people who chocked to death and a bunch of other things.   And now I am watching Superstar USA, which is very funny. All these people think they are really good singers, when really the judges are trying to find the worst singers. Mario is my favorite bad singer, but I think that Jamie will win. Hee.

      Even though I doubt that anyone will read this, here is my blog. The only reason I really made this blog was so I could post comments on other people's, so it might be a tad boring. I have nothing else to say, so I will shut up.

      I haven't posted for awhile because I really wasn't in the mood, but now I feel like I should catch up. So, yeah.  On Thursday pretty much nothing happened. I vegetating at home all day by the computer, and then I went to gymnastics. Practice wasn't as productive as I would like it to be, and I am bruised on my forearms from doing straddle backs. There is no circulation in the gym, so I brought one of those spraying fans. Probably the most interesting part of the day was the ride home. The girl that still needs in alias's mom was driving down the street and didn't want to hit this horribly bad rollerbladder, and I said it would be really funny if he fell. And just then, he trips and almost falls. Of course I start cracking up, and no alias's mom asks me if I'm high. She was like, "Oh, right. You're high on gymnastics and life!" (that isn't the only time I've heard that from someone.) So eventually we pass that kid, and I start laughing really hard, while staring at him and the windows are rolled down. I felt kind of bad, but I just kept laughing until she parked in my driveway.  Yesterday was really, really fun. Di and I didn't buy Franny her birthday day present yet, so we went shopping just before her party. We bought her a big cd case, this awesome bag with little squishy things on it with a backmassager, lotion, and shower gel in it from Bath and Body Works, gum, mints, and Brush Ups(c) (they are awesome! You have to try them out!) We shoved it all in the cd case in the end. Oh, and I also took tons of tootsie rolls from a dish and put them in too. Then, I found out that Di has a green, black, and blue fetish. Every store we went into she wanted to buy almost everything that was green. It was crazy. She did buy a green shirt, but it said picnic on it, which basically meant she had to buy it ( we are going to go on a picnic with Cate sometime because she's never been on one.) After being bemused by tissue paper and bows, we looked at ties in Kohl's. That was awesome. You wouldn't believe how many awesome ties there are. Diana wishes she could wear them.  Then, Di's mom picked us up to go over to Francis's house for her party. We had a little trouble getting there, but we managed. Once everyone arrived, which took quite awhile, we headed over to the park to play capture the flag. It was about a one and a half hour game, and it ended after someone on the other team in jail told me where the flag was. Di slipped in the mud, and I'm pretty sure her khaki capris are ruined. My white shirt is soaking right now, with the hopes that the mud splatters come out. Then we walked back and threw a football around and ate brats and hamburgers. Then we ate really yummy cake and opened presents. I'd have to say that by far Di and I had the best present. One guy gave Franny socks, SOCKS!!!! The worst part is they had reindeer and Christmas trees on them. I guess it's the thought that counts.  Then at night I watched Conan and then Elimidate. Elimidate was so predictable, yet again. Of course the normal person eliminated first. There was a trailer trash of a girl named Jackaay on (that's her name for herself) and she made the show, well, interesting. Then there was a girl named Teetzia that was a nail salonist, or whatever you call it and a really snot named Angelika who didn't even know what her job was. The guy picked the snot in the end, and she kind of reminded me of Becky in "Drop Dead Gorgeous."  Well, that's all. I'll post about Florida soon.

      I am really boread and sad. I can't wait until gymnastics. No one is visiting my blog, so I don't even know why I'm posting. But pity parties are stupid, and I will keep on posting for my own satisfaction.  Anyway, on to Florida Day 3. We went to the New Smyrna Beach today, one of my favorite places in the world. It was perfect out. I was still a tad burnt, but I really didn't care. I went boogie boarding a ton. The waves were actually kind of small, but it still was a blast. I saw about four dolphins, which I have never ever spotted at this beach. There are also these weird birds that dive head first into the water to catch fish. Hyssa thought this was really funny.  My dad also dug a "fwee fwee" pool for her (if you ever watched Spongebob Prehistoric you know that fwee fwee means fire in their cave man language.) It didn't actually contain fire, but it was really deep. She shared it was two girls. They were extremely nice, so I hung around and played with them for a bit.  Then Mimi and I walked down the beach and looked for seashells. I think that is one of my favorite things to do, partially because I can't do it whenever I want. There are so many cool shells. My favorite one's are the ones that look like huge finger nails. We also looked for them every time the tide came up. We found the most this way. Toward the end my mom found a starfish accidently. We put it in the "fwee fwee" pool. What was kind of surprising was that is only had for arm/point things. Some guy from Texas asked if he could have it for his salt water aquarium. We gave it to him, becuase what were we going to do with it?  After we got back we swam for maybe a half an hour and then headed back for the condo. I think I napped for two hours or so before we ate dinner. We watched TV as almost a whole family for once. It was actually fun, because usually I don't see my family as a whole. I also played Candyland Old Maid with Hyssa. It took awhile for her to get the hang of it, but it wasn't too horrible. Then I pretty much went to bed and that was it. Just another relaxing day. Oh, I decided I would add a pretty picture of a  urlLink purple and green sandle . It is probably from Cate's dad's store. Hee.

      Last night at practice I was so incredibly frustrated. Time off is horrible and stupid! Even though I loved Florida, now that I'm back, I almost hate it. On beam last night, the first backhandspring I did I totally crashed and I think I sprained my wrist. So, I couldn't do backhandprings because they hurt too much, but I really wanted to work on my series. Grrrrrrr. Then I did back tucks, which went surprisingly well, except I never can connect the jump after it. Then I decided to do my front layout dismount, which just about killed my ankle. So I got advil and taped my wrist and I felt somewhat better.  Vault went much, much better. Even though I haven't done tsuks for a couple of weeks, I actually almost stuck a few. it made me feel a lot better and less frustrated. So, Bruce told me to head over to bars to work on my toe-on, toe-off dismount because I haven't done them in awhile. I didn't get to do them because we ran out of time, so I think I'll just chuck them by myself today. At the end of practice, when we watied out side, I started kicked a plastic thing with free papers about buying houses. Di witnessed this. I was just really frustrated.  I think I also mentioned 80s Lady before, which I should explain about. She is this awful coach we have who has a mullet and wears spandex shorts and neon scrunchies and it's just ugly. The only thing she ever corrects us on is pointing our toes or straightening our legs. And every time you take a turn, she watches you like a hawk, so it makes it so hard to concentrate. And no one trusts her to spot, because we think we might die. Yes, she is a nice person but she just is an awful coach and I just hate her, and hate isn't too strong of a word.   Also we started our new carpool yesterday, which was pretty interesting. I need to think of an alias for this girl, but her mom took us to practic today, and she was driving like a maniac because she thought we were late. I was gripping on the handle on the door so tight. On the way home, my mom drove, and it took us about a million years to get to non-alias girl's house, because she told us to take the street that much slower than another one. She felt really bad though. Oh, and Di made a color coaded schedule, which she took 45 minutes to make. It was a good idea.  I will post again today, because I have absolutely nothing going on. So, if you are bored like me, here is a website for  urlLink montages , here is  urlLink Franny's new blog  and it is so awesome,  urlLink Cate's incredly awesome blog , even thought you brobably know the url already, and J urlLink ust Roy's awesome blog .

      On Saturday I hung out at the pool from about 8 until 2, because I came back just in time to see the end of Nationals prelims. I was so incredibly burnt; it was awful. I got hungry really early for lunch (at about 10:30), so I got a BLT from the pool bar as they call it. It was really, really yummy. I swam some laps in the pool and started "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," which is such a good book. So I went back and watched TV and snacked. Then, after dinner we decided to go shopping at the Disney Marketplace. It is so awesome there! I bought some stuff too, like gummies, a cholate and peanut butter chip dipped pretzle (quite possibly the best thing ever invented), lemon Italian ice, and a back pack that has Alice and Wonderland on the back. The back-pack sounds dorky, but it really isn't. Di and Betty saw it, and they didn't make fun of it which is a good sign. Hyssa had to get Minnie Mouse ears, and she complained for awhile because we couldn't find them. So, that was pretty much the day. It was very relaxing, which it should be on vacation. I also have a scan of the bag the gummies were in. I know I'm a dork, but I thought it would be something to make my blog less boring.  urlLink Gummies!

      At the moment I am too stupid to think of a title, or too lazy. I have to go to gymnastics soon, well, as soon as someone picks me up. I'm excited because the 80's lady won't be coaching tonight. I'll post when I get back.

      Sorry about my gymnastics post yesterday. For some reason the links wouldn't work. I'll look into that more later. Today Princess Di and Betty will start Level 6. Yay! We get to work out at the same time now and Princess Di is making a carpooling sceduele. Oh, I have a gymnast of the day: Bianca Flohr. The link to her website is this (if it works) http://www.sitesbymorgan.com/bianca.

      I decided I am going to tell about a day of my vacation each day, so her it goes.  Day 1  I woke up at 4:30 AM, basically comatose. I got a total of three hours of sleep, the most in my family except for my four-year-old sister Hyssa (that is actually her make believe friend's name, but it'll be an appropriate alias.) So then I somehow ended up in the car and we were on our way to the airport. We checked in really easily and everything and waited in the terminal for about an hour. I had a horrible headache, but it was probably from all the coffee I drank the night before at graduation. We finally boarded the plane, and we found out that no one could sit in row one and two. And of course that was where my family was supposed to sit, so we ended up being spread out all over the plane. I sat next to Hyssa, who was as cool as a cucumber the entire time, very unlike Cate, hee. It was about a half an hour flight to the O'Hare airport, which wasn't bad at all. Then we walked to over to a little museum for Hyssa, where she played for a while (it had a fake airplane and luggage and stuff) and bought bagels and coffee at a Starbucks. Then we left to go to our flight to Orlando. I was engorged in the third Harry Potter book for most of the two hours, but I did watch a little TV and listened to music. I also had a horrible seat kicker, so I kept reclining my seat back over and over. Then, the kid next to him threw up when we were landing (or as my dad would say, he ralphed.) It smelled so bad. Then we did all that good stuff we arrived at the airport: got off, got our luggage, rented a car from Alamo (a silver Montana, almost like Betty's, and so on. We went to my grandpa's condo which is in Apoka in a really nice place called Errol Estates. To be more specific, it is in the Golf Villas, of Linkside Village, of Errol Estates, in case you were wondering. We brought everything into the condo and got our suits on to go swimming the the pool. Errol is a country club, so we swam in that pool. That night we all fell asleep at about nine. We all were so wiped out. Oh, and I shared a room with my seventeen-year-old sister a Mimi. (My brother Thurston had the privilege of sleeping on the couch.) To be continued . . .

      I have decided to make a gymnastics post every day, or at least when stuff of interest comes around. As most of you probably don't know, the US Gymnastics Championships to place a week ago in Nashville, Tennessee. There wasn't a computer in Florida, so I had to wait until today to find out who won.  urlLink   Those are the senior all-around results  urlLink   and here are the junior all-around results. If you want any more results just ask; I should know. Also, I was reading my comments and someone was wondering what level I'm in. I'm in level 9 and I wouldn't say I'm great or anything, but I'm really hoping to get a gymnastics scholarship to a good college.

      Here are the topics of tomorrow:  The Chronicle and me not talking stupid to the interviewer.  The Press Gazette photographer flash being too bright.  Nadia the Movie and her ugliness that includes looking like a mouse and having sideburns.  Being hyper at 6:30 in the morning and picking my grundy on live TV.  Pancakes and eggs being mixed at IHOP.  Working out at Gym Kids and actually being satisfied.  My mini-me's birthday party.  So I have quite a bit to talk about. That's why I'm going to save it for tomorrow when I'll probably be bored. Wahoo. Hee. Too much enthusiasm there.

      HA! Actually there is a tornado warning in the area, or was. I'm not too sure because I'm not watching the news because my sister is playing the sims on playstation 2. Anyway, I do have a story.  So we were waiting outside for Di's mom to pick us up. We includes Ditserella and her 5 year old sister, another gymnast, Betty, and obviously Di and I. After running through puddles and getting our shorts all wet, the tornado siren goes off and Ditserella's little sister starts crying. So now Ditserella starts freaking out and starts calling Di's mom and her mom and who knows who. The Y is locked, so obviously we can't get in and I keep accidently talking about dying, which is freaking out the little one.  Di's mom comes eventually and Disterella is still freaking out. Then, we head over to Betty's house because it's closest and we want to take precautions. So we go there and hang out for a bit and admire Betty's shrine to gymnastics on her door. Then we go home. Good story, tell it again. SNAPS!!!!  Di and Franny, thank you for the wonderful comments, they are b-e-a-utiful. Snaps for you!  Oooo, and I'm going to be on TV!!! Yay! On Good Day Wisconsin they are doing four four minute segments on gymnastics and our team going to nationals. It's for this health watch thing, but who cares! Being on TV rocks my face off. We also might be in the Press Gazette and Chronicle too! I'll stop and spare you my hyperness.  I'll post again if there is anything interesting.

      CATE IS HOME!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!!!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHELLSIE!!!!  Today is an awesome day, and once again I'm hyper. It's like I have this endless energy, and I love it.   Gymnastics went surprisingly well. I did my toe-ons and straddle backs without taping on bars and on vault I made all my tsuks. I'm in such a wonderful mood. More gymnastics tonight! Yay! I have to leave for practice in a half an hour and I still haven't eaten dinner or changed. Oh well, procrastenating works for me. I also made up a new dance during vault. It's called the flip dance. Maybe it will sweep the nation just like Roy's will. Then on bars my shoulder itched so I started biting it, and then I realized that I had fingers. Sometimes I wonder why I'm not blonde.  I'm sure I'll post when I get back from practice, because I'm having a sudden obsession for posting. Maybe 'Funniest Home Videos' will be on tonight. Di and I love the ones where people kill themselves. They had a one where they kept showing people falling or whatever on rope swings and all different kind of swings. I was laughing so hard.

      Conan was so funny last night, even if I did fall asleep during the middle of it. In the beginning of the show, Max Weinburg had a bong trumpet. I think that beat bong hat by a long shot. Hee. They also had "If They Mated" which is one of my favorite things on late night. Also, Conan had a a really cool tie, which he called gay. Di would have loved it.  TODAY CATE IS COMING HOME!!!! YAY!!!

Then I have the privelage of doing gymnastics for 5 hours. I am just way too excited.   Conan is on in about a half an hour. Yes! I am suddenly getting very excited about everything. :D

      I feel so relieved tonight and really tired. Gymnastics went very very good. I did my backhandspring series on beam, which as made my day. The ellie language is growing, and now I have another alias: Anelly. I feel so special. I've also been calling it Languagelly, which I like better.  Today I shopped with Franny and Di. It was very, very fun. We tried on tons of shirts at Old Navy and bought one, and Franny ran around returning a bunch of stuff. Tomorrow she's going to return some shirts that she bought today; she is so funny.  I wish I could write more. Maybe I'll try to be more in depth another time. Oh, I have a new site meter from Ned Stat Basic. Check it out if you are extremely bored, like I usually am. I also have to stop using I, it is peeving me a whole lot.

      So Franny and Betty and DI are over at the moment, and we are quite hyper.   At gymnastics tonight I was so, so hyper. Nicole and I were pissing 80s Lady off so extremely bad. When she'd try to critique me I'd just say, "I know," and we were purposely falling all over the place. I felt kind of bad, but it was fun. Then when we went to vault my whole team made up a language, called 'ellie' or languagellie. It is so amusing to talk in. Maybe I'll teach it to some of you blokes sometime. Anyway, I kept running around and singing 'Zipedee Doo Dah' and dancing like and idiot. I guess Ditserrella (I finally have an alias for her!) caught on. I've never ever heard anyone talk so fast. The sad part is I understood her whole little story about Subway.  Anyway, we are now watching Mafia!; It is so funny. Well, I should get going, I'll probably post some more, knowing me. Di and Betty said they will post later, but for some reason I'm doubting it.

      This is the  urlLink blue leotard . I haven't been in much of a posting mood lately, but I'll try to more often.   I had practice today at 1 to 3 and again in about 45 minutes. It's been going better, but I don't know if I'll be ready for nationals.   Oh, and tonight Betty, Di, and Franny are coming over! Yay! But it would be more fun with Cate. Anyway, I'll write soon. Buhbye!

      Today was a pretty relaxing Father's day. I went to church and then just collapsed on the couch and stayed there untill we had to drive to my aunt's house. We didn't do much, and my grandpa and uncle watched the US Open almost the whole time. Dinner was awesome of course because my aunt is basically a much better version of Martha Stewart, without all that legal crap. We had ribs and baked potatoes and for desert, blueberry pie. I am so stuffed right now, and it's about 5 hours after. I think that may be a first.

      Nicole and I singing 'Tomorrow" and dancing at 7 in the morning.  Playing bumper cars on the floor by sliding around on your butt. FYI, it makes your bum extremely dirty and dusty when you do this.  Me picking my grundy three times on live TV.  Soul Train's butt hanging out on live TV.  Me falling off the beam on TV. It was a foot shot, thank the gods. The camara man said he didn't get it, but you could clearly see it/ My feet leave the beam and then all of the sudden there's my head.  Nicole mixing my eggs with my strawberry pancakes at IHOP.  Me laughing so hard I start coughing. I swear that if I wouldn't have stop someone would have come and done the Heimlich on me. EVERYBODY was staring at me.  Nicole doing her giants on the actual bar.  Soul Train learning how to twist correctly.  Me doing double twists into the pit.  Poola going for her front layouts on floor and them being b-e-a-utiful.  My mini-me's friend giving her $50 worth of My Scene stuff for her birthday. She says she's not rich but she has an indoor pool and movie theatre and a bunch of other stuff. Sure, sure, sure . . . that's what they all say.  Me staying up for 19 hours straight. My favorite part.  That was probably one of the most intesting days of my entire summer. It felt like a bunch of days jammed into one.   BB's Clutzy Moment of the Day  I'm on Di's new beam and I decide to do a handstand. Suddenly my hand slips off and I land on my shoulder and kick a table. Then I lay on the floor laughing with Di.

      I know I haven't posted for awhile and I apologize. I haven't had a lot of time because of extra practices and working and stuff, but tomorrow I will post on yet another topic.  So on Thursday at practice two different newspapers came: one took pictures and one interviewed. Before the one newspaper guy interviewed me he shook my hand, but didn't actually shake it which really bothered me for some reason. And for once, I didn't talk stupid. Maybe I mumbled a bit, but they can't put that in the paper. Then my coach talked and some other people and blah blah blah.  That was fine, but the stupid photographer was horrible. He had a gigantic light thing that would flash every time he took a picture. So you'd be in the middle of doing something and all of the sudden there was a bright light. That kind of made it sound like dying, but oh well. And on bars I couldn't do anything until he went away. I really need a better vocabulary.  Then when the photographer asked for my name, I told him I was a Big Green Monster. Di, for some retarded reason, could not remember this and kept saying the Great Green Monster. This was partially a nickname made by Bruce Almighty, along with [my name]burger and [my name]hamburger.  Soon they left and I headed over to Nicole's house to sleep-over. That wasn't too great of an idea because we had to get up at five. We stopped at Blockbuster and rented the Nadia movie. It is so corny but I love it a ton. Also, the actress that plays Nadia is extremely homely. Actually there is two of them, but they are both ugly. I know Di would have a lot to say about this. But the worst part are the bang things she has. THey go half-way around her head and it looks like a mullet. Nicole and I were laughing so hard.  I'll put some funny conversations at the bottom of this, and hopefully tomorrow I'll be more interesting. One isn't really a conversation.   ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~   Nicole's sister walks into Weathervane.   Nicole's Sister: This is a youngin's store with lots of youngin's stuff and youngin's clothes.   Sees some girls looking at thongs.   Nicoles' Sister: (says very louldy) Those are not for youngin's.  By the way, she calls old people Onions.  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~   Paris was reading this list of mind riddles. This one is about yawning.   Paris: (she's explaing how the joke works for Nicole) You know how yawns are contagious and when another person yawns it screws up there eardrums.  Soul Train: I just thought of something really gross.   She starts having laughing attack.Pretty soon everyone gets it except for Nicole who just has troulbe putting two and two together.   If you people don't get, well, that's just pathetic. :D

      I'm so tired for no good reason, although I didn't get very good sleep. This will be the last time I post before Lake Owen. I'm so excited (about going to Lake Owen, not about not posting.) I have to go to Ditserella's house at 6:30 tomorrow. We want to get there early and Super Ditserella may get lost.   I shopped at  Target  today with Di and Ditserella to get stuff for camp. I now have my very own jar of  peanut butter , (just for me, no one else) baked  Doritos  (possibly my favorite thing in the world), a 12-pack of  Mountain Dew ,  Venus Divine , and all that little travel size&nbsp;stuff. I'm pretty much all pack, and very pooped. I hope I'm able to stay online tonight.&nbsp;

       Everbody please pray for Di and her family. Her grandpa died. Di, if you're reading this, I love you and if there's  ANYTHING  you need just ask.

      The blog is back from hibernation.&nbsp;Except from&nbsp;this&nbsp;Sunday to Saturday&nbsp;I can't post because I'm at Lake Owen.   Today I was being very anal about hangers. My clothes are now only hung on white hangers, which leaves me with an emense amount of colored ones. But I did hang&nbsp;my gymnastics stuff on  purple  ones. I even exchanged some of my colored ones for my sisters white ones. While I was doing this I was chuckling to myself, " off-white ," as though she really cared what color hanger her clothes were on. For that matter, most of her clothes are scattered on the floor.  I also found out I loathe metal hangers. They just bother me to an extreme, as well as the cheap plastic ones they use in stores. Now my closet is beautiful, with the hangers evenly spaced, nothing on the floor, and well, it's just pretty.  I'm excited to use the   c  o  l  o  r   s . The are uber cool.

      Yes, my blog has been revived after a slightly longer vaction than I anticipated. I don't really have much to say,  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Some Guy That Works at the Y: First you make kids explode and now you make them cut their feet. You're fired.   He was referring to the day before that a kid, which wasn't even part of the gymnastics camp, that pooped in the pool. Soul Train was saying how it was smushed all over the bottom of the pool. I didn't work that day, luckily. Then the day after the poop incident a girl from SAAC cut her foot. (Another one that wasn't ours.)

      At Lake Owen Nicole and I were talking about Terin Humphrey's awful eyeliner.  Eliza: What kind of name is Humphrey? Why? Does she hump a lot? Oh, I forgot, she's hump-free.  Just a little thing I thought I'd add. Right now Di is trying to type correctly. So far the mispellings are: sill instead of still, bathes instead of baths, and definatly instead of definitely. Not too shabby.
