      Wah......realli realli miss those days when i was still looking for job a month or so ago. Realli carefree and everyday sleep late and wake up late. Every Tue and thur would go all the way to CCK to swim wif my swimming kakis. Would mit up wif my fren at ard 11 at yew tee mrt station and take a bus there while another fren of mine whos very anti-social, i wld say, would be in the pool liow when we reach. I would swim for 30 laps. yes 30 laps, which usually took me ard one and the half hours to finish. 30 laps in terms of to and fro along the length of the pool is consider one lap. Siong lah but enjoy it thoroughly cos after that we would go over to the Spa Pool where they have jacuzzi and apend another half an hr there. And i got so tan in the hot afternoon sun that my dad reprimanded me and say i look like banghala. Then after the swim we would have our lunch at either yew tee or coffee chop near Lot1.  Cos workload getting heavier liow and roadshows coming up soon so stress also building up. Life's like that lah, when u r in it, u wont appreciate it. Its onli u gone thru it and look back then will find how lucky u were back then. Like when i was still serving the NS, everyday will be like thinking when can ORD. But now i find NS life very carefree cos onli have to act on orders. Now working liow, no more such things. And thinking back, how fun NS life was. Looking back at all the photos taken realli never fails to make me laugh or smile. All the stupid and funny things we did, joking ard like nobodies business, shouting ard and all the fightings also.   But nevertheless, we still have to look ahead. Looking back is good sometimes but we still have to move on. Life still gotta carry on and i guess we cant do anything about it. So, Lets move on and keep searching and work towards our goal in life or simply jus live life everyday until u vanish from the face of earth. Realli wondering now whether the scenarios in the movie, " the day after tomorrow", will happen or not. Wat do u ppl out there think??? @_@??  Cheers, Teddy (nothing to write, write crap)-_-"

" no lah very sian anyway can i call u back after my jog?" she asked. " ok lor, jus give me a call lah when u finish" i replied. actually i damn tired liow cos had a sumptious steamboat dinner wif my colleagues and so damn filling. went back to sleep when she called my hp. i rejected the call and used my rm phone to call her. chatted til 1 plus and she ask me to give her a morning call in the morning.

      We muz all learn to appreciate life as it is. Suddenly i feel so lucky. Got into my current job as a Project Coordinator in Jardine OneSolution(JOS) withour having to go thru any interview or watsoever, the kind of job where u cant find elsewhere, amount of things to be picked up and learned in the company, chance to perform in Muchuan(the Ark) where a lot of ppl dream about. if all the above is not enough, then u will never be satisfied with watever in life and i urge u to go get urself an insurance and go commit suicide after a year.  Dont know leh....suddenly so much feelings rush into my head. Life can actually be wonderful but it all depend on how u want it lor. One sad day is a day passed, one happy day is a day passed, so y not make ur day a happy one? I know, easier said than done u might say but wats so difficult, try to laugh or smile at least once a day. Try to make other ppl's day.   One experience i had in bugis food court. Met a fren for lunch and she went ahead to order her food while i wait and jagar the seats. Table full of used utensils and cockeries. The cleaner auntie who looked ard 40+ came along and started clearing the table. Her face huh....hwah.....think someone owe her billions of dollars nv pay ah!! Then dun know y lah that day in good mood, i told the auntie :" auntie, xie xie ni, xin ku ni leh". Hwah and u know wat happened? No, she didnt throw the leftover fishball soup at me.... instead, she gave me a big grin. The most wonderful smile i ever seen on a cleaner auntie face b4. Like she tio beh bioh like that. Realli and i feel so wonderful after that and kept thinking about the incident for the entire day feeling good. She passed by a few times while i was lunching away and smile to me. No lah, i dont think she interested in me lah. Couldnt be one lah...;) haha. well thats it for making other ppl's day and in turn making ur day. Enjoy everyday, be happy every morning that u actually have a chance to open ur eyes and have the chance to live another day. Make ur day today!!!!  cheers, Teddy

      Well well....guess a guy like me shldnt realli be doing this but wat to do, too boring liow. Things like this happens when frens ard u onli call/jio u when they need u. Ironic huh?? and at the end of the day they blame u for not calling or contacting them. But i guess ppl need their own time and space also lah huh??   well, thats me i guess, someone who dont realli express my feelings openly. Someone who wld rather keep everything to myself (sometimes). Thats y the one i liked/loved wont know my feeling towards her and i will be so miserable. Keep thinking too much and making myself sad and down for the entire week. Try too hard to make it known w/o expressing it out verbally by caring and showing concern...in the end....remember i came across this phrase which i agree totally, "men express their feelings thru actions instead of words". well, that totally describes me.  Really miss her lor.....been so long since i last seen her( to be exact, ard 2 weeks onli lah). She agreed to meet me for clubbing wif few of my frens she knows last fri but on fri she msn me and say she got an appt and couldnt make it and that she wants to minimise clubbing cos of her coursework and job. Ok, its fine wif me. She said she would come for my debut performance at Safra Muchuan on sat nite and she even said she written it down on her organiser. But on sat, i sms her and she never replied. Thot she would come and was realli looking forward to seeing her but she didnt turn up even though i smsed her the exact location which of cos she nv replied. She never even called..... :( I was disappointed. Even though i enjoyed the experience of my first performance at muchuan but i feel that i will enjoy it more if she was there. After the performance, i smsed her again and again she nv reply. So i called her and asked her where she is. She said :" Devils, jus reached onli" which was ard 11 plus alrdy.(and she say she want to minimise clubbing).  "With who", i asked.  "Vive and a sec sch gal fren, u?", she claimed "still at muchuan", i replied "wah so late still there", she commented "yup, going for supper wif the new frens from muchuan, u enjoy urself then", i said "ok bye", she said and hung up.  well, i tried not to think about it so much but when someone u liked so much didnt even bother to reply ur sms, the feeling sux. On Fri, she msn me in office and ask me if i had replied her on the digicam question. I replied that she didnt asked me, and she asked me if i have a digicam which she could borrow for her brother to take some snapshots of his shop to be posted on web. i agreed intially but advice her on some things which i want to clarify. i asked her to be careful and take care of the cam cos my mum paid for the cam and i will be lending it to her without my mum's knowledge and she would have to return it asap after use to prevent my mum from finding out. As there was once my sis lend a cam to her fren and upon returning the cam was faulty and my mum made a big fuss out of it. As i dont wan things like that to happen as u know lah, it get very sensitive when it comes to money and stuff like this and cos i liked her so much, i dont wan things like this to happen. Then she said:" nvm lor, i also scared i spoilt it, its ok i can borrow from other frens". Am i wrong to make things so clear? Is she angry or upset that i brought that up? I dun know lah.....i even offer to help the brother take photo and send it over to her. can someone advice me if i'm wrong?? I realli like her alot lor and she jus ended a relationship. I understand she needs time and it realli hurt me when i hear or see her cry. But does she realise that i like her alot? i dont know? do i realli have to spell it out? isnt it obvious?? Can someone tell me wat to do.....missing her like fuck and been thinking of her so much that its realli going to ruin my life. Now i understand the meaning of " bei ai shi xing fu, ai ren shi tong ku".  Lastly on my debut performance at Muchuan Safra Town Club. It was realli rush lah the schedule, Ah Du, one of the singer there informed me of the performance onli on last wed's nite @ ard 11 plus and i was suppose to meet him for training the following nite after work. and i didnt even have time to search for lyrics of songs i want 2 sing, did a crash search and came out wif a few songs which i dont feel its enough. I was teamed up wif Ah Du who play the keyboard for us, a fellow female new singer( that nite was her second performance) called qiu qun, a nice guy who had been in muchuan for a couple of yrs who is suppose to do all the toking that nite cos we r new and would not realli know how to make the show interesting. his name is Jie Hao. Well, i did screwed up a few times and luckily theres not much audience present. onli a few tables occupied. I was having my vocal class from 6.30 to 7.30 that nite and the performance is like at 8. I rushed over w/o dinner and the worst thing is i didnt even have the chance to practice wif qiuqun. We sang three duets in total and was quite impressed wif the first two in fact. Ni zui zhen gui by Jackie Cheung and Gao Hue Jun, and Wu Ding by Jay chou and Landy. the last one which is suppose to be our finale song was a disaster cos ah du played it in a wierd kind of way and i couldnt realli catch up with the tune and key, and also cos of lack of practice wif qiuqun....but its all over. my overall feeling? I have a long way to go and so much to learn. Brought along my digicam hoping to capture a few pics of my debut performance but couldnt cos no one to do it for me while performing. but i did take a few after that. Qiuqun left early to catch a bus so miss a chance to take one wif her but nonetheless i can always take one wif her some other day bah. Went for supper with ah du, jie hao, qing shan(head waiter i guess) and alicia(Lady boss of Muchuan) and she was kind enuff to drive everyone back including me whose house is most out ot the way.....realli appreciated it... Really glad and feel so lucky to have a chance to experience all this. Guess life dun realli sux after all, u jus have to make it count ;)  Cheers, Teddy

       urlLink    good movie  jus as i was giving up on the movie industry, this korean movie saved it....Titled, Windstruck, although i feel not better than the previous gig, My sassy girl, but can be on par.....besides having the same female lead, the story line was in a similar plot but different in a way that this time the female lead was more emotional....Sorri gan jie, that nite u suggested that we go catch it?? actually i wanted to watch it with someone else....hehe hope u dun mind huh!!! Dun worry i will ask raymond to go watch it wif u.....if u like my sassy girl, u will definitely like this one. HY says its better than my sassy girl but i dont agree....y? its not as funny lah although its has its fair bit of comedy in it.....but its definitely more touching than my sassy girl. watch out for the ending scene.....i'm not going to reveal too much cos it will spoil the whole show. PPL, go catch the show....worth every cents, especially if u watched it wif ur special someone ;) the next movie i'm actually looking forward to is actually Brotherhood...also a korean movie. no not spiderman2....such lame show....well the koreans sure make good movies nowadays huh?? wonder wat took it so long for them to surface in singapore!!!   cheers, Teddy

      Never realize that time realli pass so fast when u r busy.....its like its the weekend liow in a blink of an eye....and the weekend always have to pass so damn blody fast. Never even rest enuff then have to start work again liow....WTF!!! Had realli been a busy week last week and recalling that today is WED liow. Two days more to the weekend again and wah....no wonder people age so fast cos time realli wait for no one. Hence, feel that we muz always try to use our time wisely....-_-"(spend all my time working lah) and treasure every minutes and seconds. Be happy that u can open ur eyes and wake up every morning. in fact we should be gratful that we were given this chance to live every morning, every day. So we shall not wait for time also.....in fact we muz get ahead of time if not, travel with time and not lag behind.....To the one i love, time is not something we can afford to waste, muz treasure every seconds of our life cos we never know wat will happen tomolo and whether someone will still be by ur side at the end of the day. so hope that u can treasure the time i spent on u and not let it go to waste cos the time i spend thinking of u is priceless and can never be retrieved. Let not the heart of someone who love u go to waste, as he will never always be there for u. He will, only when u know how to treasure his time and effort. u have onli one life so live it wisely. To all the ppl out there, Look ard u and u might jus find that special someone who r willing to spend their precious time thinking of u and treasure them cos they r hard to come by and they might jus disappear the next day. Dont bother to spend time on someone who wont even spare a second on u!!! Time is priceless and can never be saved or accumulated. Spend it wisely and meaningfully. :)  cheers, Teddy

      Wow, this is one of my happiest day in my life so far. I shall describe everything from the beginning of the day to now. Actually i met up wif her last nite wif her frens and one fren of my for dinner lah. Although we didnt tok much thru out the nite but it was a relief to see that she looked better than a week ago. Was realli tired lah and this morning have to go to Ngee ann poly to set up things for Mon's notebook distribution. So sian...cos usually sat morning can sleep til late late one. but anyway, i woke her up this morning for her checkup....she supposed to go for medical checkup but when i called her at ard 12 plus, she said she never go for the checkup and i asked if she coming for my performance later and she said see how lor....KNS....waste my effort to wake her up but i dun mind....hehe.....then rush down to Muchuan to practice for the performance....expecting that she wont turn up.....and in the midst of practicing, my gan jie karen sms me and said she couldnt make it and apologised. Bit disappointed lor but have to understand that something impt might have cropped up lah. so no prob.  this time my performance was at Apollo centre muchuan. Partnered wif ah du and my fellow course mate called jenix. Jenix is a very good guitar player....upon hearing that we will be performing together, she asked me for the song list i'm goin to sing for today one week in advance and she listened to the songs and practice them. she's very good and we practiced on last tuesday...everything went smooth.  then ah du told me he can onli help us play for the first hour and the rest of it we have to manage it by ourself. we r a bit worried that we cannot managed lah haha. and jus as ah du is leaving for his class (he teaches), i asked him to help me play one song, Tian Tian Xiang Ni, and dedicated it to her even when she not there. i didnt mention her name which everyone asking me to say, i jus said that i'm singing this for the owner of Gou xiong brand alarm clock.....haha onli she knows wat this means.....anyway we had a short break after ah du left and went on to perform after. And as we were performing, my sec sch frens starts coming in....realli happy to see them....and after them, she came wif kk and vive. I was so surprised......in fact very very surprised and she is wearing her pink dress and she looked so good. i'm so happy at that moment that word cant describe my esctasy. After i saw her, i did my best in all the songs i sang and Fwah.....happy til dun know wat to say.... after a while, a tan guy called jian hua came on stage suddenly....i thot who he is and he turned out to be a muchuan singer who sings on sunday nites. and ah du never mentioned anything.....hai wo sia dao. anyway the fact that she came for my performance realli made my day. And i did feel that i improved a bit since my first performance lor. Verry Verry happy though can be better if my gan jie turned up and SHE complete her checkup wif negative results. Still this is the happiest day of my life.....and also mus mention ang hock beng who came last min...realli super last min...but at least he came lah haha....ok shared my happy day and my performance ended well....and for those whose present on my performance, any feedback how i can improve?? Pls leave behind ur comments in my shoutbox or friendster...thanks...  cheers, Teddy

      During one of my vocal lesson in muchuan, my teacher ask us to do an assignment to help us understand the elements of a song more. Elements in sense of the feeling of the whole song, the meaning of the lyrics and how u would want to express urself in a song. We were given a simple tune and asked to become, 1.lyricist, 2.MTV Director for the song and 3.Singer. the tune goes like this:    Do Re Mi   Do Re Mi                                           Do Re Mi   Do Do                                           Do Re Mi   Do Re Mi                                           Do Re Mi   Do Do                                                                                  Do Ti La So   Do Ti La So                                           So Fa Mi Re   Do Re Mi                                           Do Ti La So   Do Ti La So                                           So Fa Mi Re   Do Do Its a very simple and nice tune when played wif musical instruments. And we were given a week to complete the Assignment and have to present it during next lesson. This is my lyrics, written when i was thinking of her, missing her. It goes like this:                                           tian hen hei   Feng hen ji                                           chuang wai hai xia    ze yu                                           xian zai ni   zai na li                                           wo zhen de xiang    zhe ni                                            wo nao hai li   quan dou shi ni                                           mei tian mei ye    zai xiang ni                                           xiang gao shu ni   que mei yong qi                                           wo zhen de hen    ai ni      haha it sounds funny though when u sing it out without music support. But thats all i can think of. Two of my classmates wrote about school and another one wrote about being cheated by someone she loved. well, when writing lyrics, ppl always put in wat is on their mind at that very moment as one of my classmate who wrote about school had actually jus finished his exams. And he wrote something about the feeling when waiting for results to be posted. I told her about the assignment and actually wanted to sing it to her and ask her how it sounds but in the end i didnt. Didnt dare to and it sounds so awful also but strangely when i presented it and sing with her in my mind, it was the best song ever.....haha -_-" cos if u want to be a good singer, u will have to inject feelings into songs. thats wat the assignment was for, to help us notice it. So, lesson for those who wants to know more about singing, there u go. Do some homework and study the song lyrics and try to feel wat the lyricist feel when he/she was writing the song and inject that feeling into the song and it will sound very good. not like in ktv where u jus read and follow the word without feeling one.....lesson learned??  Cheers, Teddy, the silly singing bear -_-"

      " I may not understand watever u r going thru, i jus know that i realli miss and cant wait to see u. even if its jus a phone conversation, or even a short SMS, i will be happy and glad when i see ur name. u can shut urself and not care about anything in the world, but pls dont deprive me of seeing u, as a look at ur face realli heals, and makes my life looks more real. i will try to give u care, regardless of the return. as giving care to someone dont cost me anything, but its a bonus if in return i get something. is this love? or is this jus another blind infatuation? probably, possibly, maybe. the greatest thing u'll ever learn, is jus to love and be loved in return?? when will i ever learn? i've never been thru anything like this, at least not so intense.... its all emotional they say but realli its not something u can control. its easy for someone else to say and advice, but to realli act on it is another issue. my advice for her? go back to him if u realli think he is worth it and that he will provide all tender love and care. if not no point dwelling over it for so long. as his heart might already been given to someone whom he is going to provide all that. i guess u know him more as u had been wif him for so long, if he realli had been missing in ur life for so long, why r u clinging on to it?? do u think he realli still care, when u r crying ur heart out, i guess he's out partying.  this is jus a blind guess, but seriously, is he realli worth it??  there is no lack of guys willing to give u care and concern u need.  and i am one of the silly ones.....giving blindly and quietly without expecting any returns. how silly? how silly i am?? well, very, i guess? dont even have the courage to say it out.....jus few simple words is all it take to express myself and here i am typing everything out in words. i'm not good in words when it come to this kind of thing.....as good as dumb huh?? to the one who i'm writing all this to?? i realli like u a lot and i am sure u knew it long ago.....a chance is all i ask.....to take care of u and make u happy. may i??  cheers, Teddy the silly bear -_-"

       Wat a long week this was.....and Finally the weekend is here. Doing roadshow at NUS the whole of this week and it totally shagged me out. So tired but also quite a good week cos dun have to stay in office everyday. I agree wif thomas, gals in singapore r getting pretty fine and wow, did i have a diabetic week in NUS.....but HY is still the one in my mind now......hehe i very zhuan yi one i tell u....overall its a fun week lah.   Found out during midweek that hy actually reads my blog.  (cannot write bad things bout her liow haha)  Was both happy and shocked to find out lah, that she actually bothers to read.  (maybe too bored, thats y)  Happy becos she will find out how i feel bout her and shocked cos this is suppose to be my personal diary kind of thing.....  ( and she wont even let me take a peak into her small calender diary...kns -_-" ) but i dont mind lah, i respect her privacy. She had been working really hard and i very scared that she will fall sick. Hope that she stay healthy forever. She has this bad&nbsp;habit of staying up late at nite and its bad for health if she dont kick the habit. ( yan, remember the newspaper cutting we saw in NUH??) Try kicking the habit and sleep earlier can?? for my sake? Can??(i doubt so hehe)   I will be performing again this coming Sunday and the next coming sunday also from 3 to 5.30 in the afternoon. And same thing lah...super last min notice one. Ah du always like that one but also good lah, cos i dont mind also since sunday nothing on one lah hehe.....If free can come lor...

      Yup, i cant believe it either.....came home from work, and had the urge to actually go running and the thing is that i had not been doing that for almost 4 to 5 months liow since i ORD. My mum didnt cook, called hy and she need to do OT, called ganjie whose suppose to be at clementi but in the end she not going anymore, justin going home, so no khaki to eat dinner. Asked my mum to da bao something for me instead and went home early. In the bus on the way home, saw lots of ppl joggin and excercising and thought that how nice it would be to start excercising again like in NS. Now i know y thomas can get so unhappy when he dun get to exercise. Had a nice 40mins jog to Bishan park and back and surprisingly, i dun feel tired at all and my stamina is still intact cos i never stop thruout the run. And i feel so wonderful and fulfilling after the run. So was thinking of trying to do that every evening before dinner. Make it a Before Dinner Run.....The run totally destress me and i feel so good after sweating so much. One Word "SHIOK".  Wanted to watch Private Parts opening on 28th july at the esplanade but ant find khaki also.....looked thru sistic website last nite and wanted to actually buy the tics online so smsed hy to ask her if she will be free on sat nite. She never reply so i called her and she also never answer.....so in the end i didnt buy cos scared wait buy liow wat if she couldnt make it, who am i suppose to find someone to go wif? Cos she mentioned to me before that she wanted to watch it so maybe do something lor but in the end, she smsed me last nite ard 2 and told me that she had already bought the tics and she will be watching it wif vive.....and she had also bought tics to the moscow circus.....:( was so disappointed that she actually bought the tics. not that she not going wif me lah but its jus that she also never ask me anything bout whether i want to watch or anything..... :'( y??? i dont know leh.....well i cant blame her lah...vive her best fren leh.....so i cant be jealous jus becos of that if not i will look totally like a chabo. wonder who she is going to the circus.....well i guess its vive again lor.....hehe.....well at least she's not going wif another guy rite??   Cheers, Teddy:"512"!!

        Attended my secondary school NPCC fren's gf 21st birthday party at costa sand pasir ris chalet last nite. It was sort of a fruitful nite as i did enjoy myself and it was realli nice to see all the frens from secondary school eca again. Although we met up quite often, ( well, definitely more often than my secondary school classmates.)  we still had so much to catch up. It had been a long time since i went to a chalet and i did not realli feel tired even after chionging on fri nite. But initially i didnt want to stay overnite but after some persuasion and psychoing by my frens, i drove the van which my fren rented back home, bath, change out of my contact lenses and headed straight back there.       &nbsp;   Went back there and they started playing black jack and toking bout bad luck.....i join the game and during my first rd, the banker got a  ban ban .....KNS....i betted one buck and lost 3 bucks instantly. And the rest started blaming me for joining in the game and seriously i feel that it was a mistake to join the game after all cos eventually, i lost all my coins worth of 5 bucks. I stopped playing after that....not that i hv no money lah but u know u  suay  liow u still want to continue play and lost meh? After a while, another fren also lost everything and he jio me go downstairs drink...and we had a relaxing conversation accompanied by the nite breeze and GIN TONIC.....super relaxing and we kind of sat there til ard 6 in the morning and chatted about BGR, and everything we can think of lah.....its been a realli long time since i stay awake all nite liow. I'm like totally destressed after the chalet trip.....glad i went and in fact alone, if not i wouldnt have stayed overnite. And we brought the period of our frenship up and to my surprised, 10 yrs had passed and we had known each other for 10 yrs liow and am i glad we still kept in contact and we are still such close frens. And no doubt, this frenship will never end. In fact we org a gathering every now and then during the festive seasons most of the time if not jus a nite out for dinner. I'm so lucky to have this bunch of frens and to them, i wish them happiness and health for as long as they live.....cheers, and hopefully ah lau will hold his traditionally wedding soon and we shall have another round of celebration again. This time,  Bu zui bu gui, zui le bian wu gui...... haha Toast to frenship.....cheers!!!       &nbsp;   CHEERS,     Teddy Teo yong sen (  luv y@n   )

And i realli wish i can see Hy more often lor.....she always seems so busy, wif her work and studies, feel that she dun even have time for herself. Not to mention that she have so many frens queueing up to meet her. Well, when u love someone, u have to accept who and wat she is and i love her so i have to accept the fact that she realli have lots of frens and like she said, she treasure frenship more than anything else..... :(  well .....wat can i say ?? At least she is trying..... Realli wish i can share some of her burdens and all that she is going thru now.  &nbsp; Now i have this habit of logging&nbsp;online everynite and check mail,&nbsp;friendster, animesuki to check for latest naruto and initial d, then follow by my own blog then to others blog to check for latest updates.&nbsp;It had realli turn into a habit liow lor. more of like a ritual or routine kind of habit liow. dun know whether its healthy or not leh haha&nbsp;-_-" lame rite?? maybe too free lor...maybe i should start reading up for my module liow starting in aug. well, really muz start liow lah if not wait too late liow then last min lagi&nbsp;jia lat. yup jus start reading up wont harm lor.....hmmm....  tok so much then go do it lah ....-_-"  lame !!! &nbsp; Haiz......life sux?? &nbsp; yes it does.... but wif hy, life's sweet :D &nbsp; cheers, Hy's (teddy brand) alarm clock &nbsp;

      hey hey.....look who we have here....think kena influenced by me lah haha. justin foo's blog.....check it out from my links. Well, dont know leh, but i feel that writing blog is the electronic way of writing a diary or a journal of some kind. It definitely make me feel a lot better during my down days where i would post all my problems and thots and hopefully share wif the world and get some advice in the midst of it. I feel that its nice to share ur thots wif someone who would bother to visit ur blog stie and read all the shit u have typed and understand ur feeling at that moment of time. Well, at least u know that u'r not alone in this world to have had this problem.....agreed?? We are human after all and sometimes we succumb to emotions and feelings without knowing. well, at least i know i am one of them.....  Was on a crowded bus, way home from bugis after passing cheques to frens, and this guy who sits beside me, toking on his hp. the irritating thing is how he use the phone. using his nokia hp, everytime he speaks, he have to bring the phone from his ears to the front of his mouth and speak into the mic of the phone.....how fucking LAME can this guy get man....y?? scared the other party cannot hear izzit?? or is the other party hearing impaired? y have to listen to the phone and bring in front of his face to speak?? no wonder everytime i listen to phone calls, it always sounds so loud.....wonder wat this ppl been thinking leh.....yr 2004 with such advance technology and ppl have to insult the technology of the information age.....how sad.....i think the inventor of mobile phone will kill himself if he sees how ppl are utilising his invention like that. and thats not the onli person i saw doing that lor.....well i mean the mic of these mobile works so well that it picks up even the background noise of the surrounding while using it lor....and also hor....u seen ppl using handsfree set while holding mobile phone in one hand?? can someone explain to me what is the meaning of HANDSFREE??? Idiots leh these ppl.....total insult to technology.....i jus hope i wont see anyone holding their mobile phone in their hand while using bluetooth handsfree set.

So LL, went back up home and got a small foldable umbrella ( wat to do? if not sure wet one and have to reach there on time. although i reached there a bit late lah ) and the stupid thing is i so BIG size and carries such big bag and the stupid umbrella so small..... but never realli got wet lah..my bag did haha!!  Reached SMU and ard 10 plus to 11, started to have runny nose. feel like a flu coming up lor and after that, feel damn sick for the whole day. used up all my tissue and still have to stay inside aircon room and have to run up and down and got a bit wet.  like that how not to get sick??.  after that feel sick for the whole day lor and still have to work late.....been working late since Monday lor...getting tired and sick of working man....haha so fast...jus started two months ago onli.  Visited thomas's blog again and found out he realli so free that he can go jogging, go bank, go look for his mardder and some more go orchard road jalan jalan. envy him so much...how i wish i have all that time. Then read my ganjie's blog also and hers was a damn long blog explaining wat true love is.....well, quite tru lah but dont know lah. cos i had been trying so hard and nothing seems to work for me lah.....(YoU cAn'T mAkE sOmEoNe LuV yOu, aLl YoU cAn Do Is Be SoMeOnE wHo CaN bE lOvEd, ThE rEsT iS uP tO tHe PeRsOn To ReAlIzE yOuR wOrTh~)-->last sentence from my ganjie's blog.

      Well so much about races and Fucking muslims and watsoever.....(found out today that lots of ppl are racist against malays, wonder why also) And my dear fren thomas touch on the diligence issue that malays are not a hardworking bunch.....well i feel its more of the culture or the environment the malays are brought up in. Some malays are very hardworking one.....well as for indians, some of them also very hardworking.   I was in a cab going back to office from SMU today, i saw two indians standing on the road divider looking thru a elevation device.( everytime u see construction workers looking thru something on a tripod??) Both of them wearing luminous vest and safety helmet....and i dont see any major construction nearby, and apparently, one of them was the supervisor of some kind teaching the other one to use the thingy. and the supervisor, he was actually holding a Hammer in one of his hand. Two indian guy, in the middle of the road, wearing safety helmet and one of them holding a hammer. Then this thot came into my mind, was the hammer used to knock the other indian's head who was actually learning to use the thingy when he made mistakes?? Maybe that explains the safety helmet which i dont see the neccessity of wearing one.  well so much for all the stupid stuff on races and Muslims.....was very busy as usual like last week and the week before last and the week before last, and before i know it, two more days before the weekend again....time passes super fast when u r busy....its like in a blink of an eye lah realli....Well, realli learnt a lot from my current job lah...gone thru a lot in such short time and i tell myself that all this is part of life and treat this as a training for my future endeavour. I can say that i'm truly lucky to be able to acquire this challenging job and be able to learn and also allowed to make mistakes and not get into deep shit. And of cos, i will definitely learn thru all the mistakes i had commited and pick up new skills and knowledge on the way.....Hopefully they will make me a better person in life and help me in my future business venture. Dont ask me what business i am going into cos i also dun know....i believe in chances and opportunities. So til my chances and opportunities pass by, i will have to keep learning and make sure that when the chances appears, the mistakes i made will help me by not repeating them again. Dun be afraid to make mistakes, learn from them. Mistakes are our teacher of life. Make mistakes while u r still young, cos when u grow older, it might be too late when forgiveness is not an option anymore.  cheers, Teddy (177155HY)

      Pls be informed that this video clip r not for the weak hearted. It is REAL!!! The inside contents of cuting the head off LIVE. Close it if U do  not like.Pls beware.The murder starts from 2 min 30 secs.. infront is all talk and talk and talk.....  http://singapore20plus.org/temp/KoreanBeheaded.wmv    After watching the clip and also the previous beheading of the american guy, I am totally disappointed in mankind.....after centuries of civilization, are we worth it?? I jus dont understand everything.....and it onli happens in muslim countries like in indonesia where it happened before also. Now i totally agree wif my fren thomas whose blog highlighted the social problems created by the particular race. Why cant america jus fucking throw them a nuclear warhead and wipe them out?? Cleanse them off the face of earth. So that ppl there dont have to be beheaded one by one. The sick thing is how they can do it to live human.....and with the chanting.....seriously when i frist saw the beheading of the american, i totally cant sleep man. Wat is happening to the world? Did their religion teach them or even encourage them to do it?? Totally dun understand. Can someone Please enlighten me?? Wat exactly is Islam teaching those ppl.....its not that i hate the race or have anything against the religion lah but after watching the two totally sick clips, i realli wonders. Can someone pls do something about it to prevent all this stupid things from happening again?? Fucking crazy lor these ppl.....Kill them all lah....they are all pollutants....cleanse them off the earth surface.....WTF? AAArrrrrggghhhh!!!! WTF is happening to the world???? Civilization??? wat is civilization???  Fuck the M@*l1ms, Teddy

      Finally got to watch "Brotherhood" today and the movie is now on my MOVIE OF THE YEAR list. Yes, i realli enjoyed the movie thru and thru, with its fair share of violence, culture, touching scenes, CGI, etc..... Its realli worth every awards available. I can say its not totally a war movie, its jus that it all happens during war period and how brotherly love is shown. Like wat thomas said, its worth every dollars and if i realli onli have $8.50 left, i wont regret spending it on this film. Out of 5 stars, i rate it 4.5 stars.  After the movie, went Mac for dinner with edward whom i watched the movie wif. And we complained to each other bout work til ard 12 plus.....ha ha complain this complain that.....haiz.....life realli sux. And after we part our way, i walked all the way from PS to pacific plaza and took a cab home from there. Such long queue outside CB.....  And during the walk, i realli feel so down that i realli feel like killing myself lah. Saw so many ppl, couples and grps of frens and i'm walking alone along orchard rd. Thot so much....and i dun know y i feel so down also. Was it work? Was it her? or was it Life and everything?? Life realli sux.....Everything is so unfair. Saw a gal light her cig and suddenly feel like smoking also. And acting on impulse, i bought my first pack of Marlboro menthol light, light my first "bought" stick and felt like shit after that. Maybe i will throw it away or give it away lah.....Realli feel like toking to someone about everything but couldnt think of anyone to tok to at that time of the nite.....i really feel so down....so down.....Feel totally fucked up....super fucked up.....was wondering wat its like to die and leave everything fuck thing behind.....i know i will be sorry to my family and frens who cared bout me but they cant realli do anything to help also lah huh??  As for now, realli feel that everything will ultimately be fine after i woke up tomolo morning after a good sleep.....so tired of everything now. Out of my 24 yrs of life, I never realli felt like this before. But i know i muz get out of this somehow, and be strong like wat my ganjie says.  Hope that i will sleep all this feelings away tonite lor and wake up happy tomolo. But i will be the most happy if i can have her by my side now. Nothing beats that lah.....she's my antidote to everything now i guess....and to yan, if u r reading this, dun blame urself.....this got nothing to do wif u,..... its all jus me. I jus want u to be happy rite? Its all to my own accord that i have to go thru all this.....i brought it upon myself. Its all jus me and me alone.....  Cheers, Teddy 1L1O1V1E1H1Y1

      Saw ganjie's quote of the moment.....felt like shit man....dun know y?? today felt super down. Even the temp staff at the SMU roadshow asked me y i so stone. Totally no mood for anything, maybe been thinking too much i guess. Thinking bout wat she had said and thinking this that and everything.   "the worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can't have them", tell me bout it lah.....thats wat i'm going thru now and it really sux lor, SERIOUSLY!!! Its like she single but not available kind of thingy and it really feels like shit to be "not rejected" and "not accepted". Its like buying lottery and the lottery never did open.....dun know got win or not. i think u all know wat i mean rite?? Bai lui li bai, dou mei you kai.....(starting of song to "tu ran fa cai") haiz.....dun know wat to do liow lah.....is this a test??  Came back from work cos no one to go out wif and no one jio go anywhere.....so sian...last week also like that. Boring Friday.....went for jog before dinner and its the longest i had ran since ORD.....i ran to bishan park 1 or 2 i cant recall and actually ran the whole of the park 1 or 2 once. But realli shagged out after the run.....leg aching a bit now....maybe i overdid it lah. after that had a nice bath and ate dinner.....played my guitar a bit and here i am bloggin nonsense again.   "i'm not crazy,  i'm jus a little unwell,  i know rite now u cant tell, but stay a while, and maybe then u'll see, a different side of me.  i'm not crazy, i'm jus a little impaired, i know rite now u dont care, but soon enuff u're gonna think of me, and how i use to be..."

      I love someone.....i give and care unconditionally for that person. Iregardless of wat i get in return, and no, i'm not waiting for any answer. maybe i am but who doesnt? Saying goes "wat goes ard, comes ard". "its better to give than to receive", i love and give and expects something back at least. of cos at least something.....no matter how much even if its not equivalent. "no fish, shrimp also good". i give so i naturally expect some return.....even if u cant give me equivalent, at least give me that little nothing and i will be contented. Like i said, i am very very silly and foolish. In fact i admit i really really am silly and foolish, i believe in love, i believe in giving unconditionally when i love that person very much. It love that drive me to do all this and not the desire or need to have a relationship, cos if thats the case, i would have given up long ago. Maybe i havent grow up, not physically but mentally. I really have a lot more to learn and a lot more to experience. A friend told me to learn to love someone who loves you, but.....teach me how. Do i have to learn it the hard way? Wats so difficult to love and accept someone? Love is actually very very simple but ppl tends to think too much and make it complicated.....thats wat i think. Maybe she dun have a feeling for me, maybe not even that little bit. its jus a one sided thing and i'm the onli willing party. But i'm not realli prepared to give up or wait for someone to love me in order to love. Cos if i dont love and give, how am i ever going to receive anything? It works like nature, in a cycle, it goes rd and rd. Maybe the saying is rite, "dun chase after happiness, jus look straight and walk ahead, happiness will follow u" Said the mother dog to the puppy who kept running ard in circles trying to catch its own tail cos the mother dog mentioned b4 that the tail is like happiness. She ask me to move on and pursue my dream.....i am, i am pursuing my dream and while i do that, cant i even have someone to share my woes and happiness with along the way and when i do achieve my dream, i hope that person i shared the joys and sadness with is none other than u.....cos i love u, really.....i realli realli do.....if loving someone is realli that hard, then y love in the first place??  Cheers, Teddy,the silly bear who love y@n alot alot alot.......
