						   Curses are words, even spells, that are spoken. They can be used by evil for evil and can be used as punishments against those who have done wrongly or sought to do wrong deeds. Curses are not only of spells like that of witch craft, but they are also mere everyday words that are used by people especially when they are angry, irritated, irrational, tired, impatient, etc. It is morally wrong to curse at someone. In fact, it is wrong to curse at anything especially when that someone or something has either done nothing wrong (in your eyes it is) or you are just not happy with the way things are going. The key thing is to be patient with whatever troubles you and ask God to help you with it. To be  patient  is for one to bear pains or trials calmly or without any complaints. Cursing your family and loved ones is disgraceful. Cursing your father and your mother will condemn you from entering God's Kingdom and will also make your life short-   Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.  -  EXODUS 2:12   It not only means Honoring them, but it also means to be polite and show courtesy and respect to them (but do NOT obey them if it means disobeying God in any way). Follow their teachings and listen to their wisdom and how they serve God (if they do, that is. If not, look up to someone else to who does for Holy reminder and an example how to serve the Lord). Parents have a special place in God's sight. Even those who do not get along with their parents are supposed to still honor them (and when you do curse or dishonor them, apologize and ask for forgiveness and then ask for God's forgiveness and then ask Him to help you not do it again).   Remember, speaking evilly is like speaking like your the devil; which you do NOT want to be like.   Like wise, your temper can lead to cursing, especially in the days of the latter. Your temper, if not controlled, can cause many harmful things. Many bad, severe things. Your temper can be your worst enemy of all if you let it. Your temper can also be the end of you if you do not learn how to control it; which you CANNOT do if you do NOT have God in your life to help you! Here is some words of Wisdom out of the  Book of Proverbs -   A fool gives vent to his anger, but a wise man keeps himself under control  -  PROVERBS 29:11   Also, cursing God is a sin. It is the  THIRD  Commandment in  The Ten Commandments -    You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name.  -  EXODUS 20:7   Oh, and just for good measure, God's last name doesn't start with a " D "! Use God's name seriously. You should use His name for praise and worship and for prayers, not for curses. Also, do not swear at all-   Again, you have heard that it was said to people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.' But I tell you, do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; or by the earth, for it is His footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. Simply let your 'yes' be 'yes' and your 'no' be 'no'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.  -  MATTHEW 5:33-37   Don't make vows you can't keep and do not curse anything that is upon the earth or in heaven. Avoid casual and irresponsible commitments to God. Tell the truth like it is, do not lie. For the truth is the truth and cannot be a lie, for a lie is a lie... And partially a lie in a truth, only is a lie. There are NO such things as little white lies. A lie is a lie, no matter how big or small it is. And one of the Six...no seven things God hates and despises most is a liar. Try not lie, it is an impulse at first if you are use to it, but if you try to do what is right and hear a little voice saying to make a lie, it's a temptation. Say that it is wrong and that God forbids it and then rebuke it.   Okay, curses. The Curses (the bad ones that are not from God) are also hexes and things that are conjured up by demonic forces and especially by the devil.  Remember, when God does put a curse on things, it's for the better good and it also teaches us a lesson.  Sorcery, like you've seen in the books of  Harry Potter  and that of movies and such, was punished by death back then. Why? 'Cause it was and still is a crime against God-   Do not allow a sorceress to live.  -  EXODUS 22:18     Do not practice divination or sorcery.  -  LEVITICUS 19:26   Why did God's laws speak so strongly against sorcery?   Do not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists, for you will be defiled by God. I am the Lord.  -  LEVITICUS 19:31    I will set my face against the person who turns to mediums and spiritists to prostitute himself by following them, and I will cut him off from his people. Consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am the Lord your God. Keep my decrees and follow them. I am the Lord, who makes you holy. If anyone curses his father or his mother, they must be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother, and his blood will be on his own head.  -  LEVITICUS 20:6-9    A man or a woman who is a medium or spiritist amoung you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads.  -  LEVITICUS 20:27    Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or a spiritist or consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you. You must be blameless before the Lord your God.  -  DEUTERONOMY 18:9-13    Why did God's laws speak so strongly against sorcery (text information taken out of the Bible is above)? Sorcery was punished by death because it was (and still is, God never changes nor does his law) a crime against God Himself. To invoke evil powers violates the first commandment to "have no other gods." Sorcery is a rebellion against God and His authority. In essence, it is teaming up with Satan and rebelling against God. You're are either on God's Side, or you are on the evil one's side! You can't be on both, nor can you be between, or on your own. If you choose your own, you are on Satan's side. You must choose God above all things and be on His side alone, because there are  only  two sides- God's or the Devil's.   Everyone is interested in seeing what the future holds, and we often look for guidance from other sources than that of God. But God warned us about looking to the occult for advice. Mediums and spiritists were outlawed back then because God was not the source of their information. At best, Occult practitioners are fakes whose predictions cannot be trusted. At worst, they are in contact with evil spirits and are thus extremely dangerous. We don't need to look to the occult for information about the future. God has given us the Bible, which has all the information we need- and the Bible's teachings is trustworthy.  Now you know the difference between different meanings of the the word "CURSE".

						    The Seven ‘I am’s of Jesus:      “What is God like?” many people ask this question throughout generations and is still being asked today.  One good answer is “Look at Jesus, He is God. He shows us what God is like!”  Jesus has seven ‘I am’s… this will help us know little bit of who God is!      Bread:    “I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry.”  -John 6:35     Light:   “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness.”  - John 8:12    Gate:   “I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved.”  -John 10:9    Good Shepherd:   “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.”  -John 10:10     Resurrection and Life:   “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies.”  -John 11:25    Way, Truth, Life:   “I am the way and the truth and the life. No-one comes to the Father except through me.”  -John 14:6    True Vine:   “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.”   -John 15:1

						    The Bad about Anger-      Anger is a strong emotion which if not controlled can be your worst enemy; many people today have this problem. Anger affects your attitude towards everything or can increase in the thing(s) that an individual despises the most; anger seems to have a tendency of misguiding the views of an individual. Anger can lead to violence, a very wicked and detestable deed that a person does when he/she is not merciful to his/her enemy(-y + ies = enemies) or his/her debtor(s). Anger can also stem off into other sins and other bad impulses; like Jealousy, pride, vengeance, etc.       Jesus said:  "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy." And in the prayer of Our Father (The Lord's Prayer):        "Our father who art in Heaven, Hollowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil (the evil one, Satan). Amen."        When you do not forgive your enemies and/or try to get back at them, you will not receive any mercy from God, only those that show mercy to anyone will obtain forgiveness.       Also Jesus said;  "What you do unto others, you do unto me!"      Meaning that what ever you do to anybody you also do to God.... So it is wise keep your anger down and be merciful while you can, for there might not be another day.       How to control your anger/What to do:       Turn from your wicked ways, for hate in a man's heart is a sin; which is entirely EVIL! Pray to God to forgive you and give you another chance, pray also to Him to help you in your life. He will help, not only believe that he can, also trust and have faith in him! Your life can become much better from there as you keep praying and have faith in God! I know it is not easy, but with God's help and you wanting to change and also trying will work.   God Bless You who ever you are, God is with you on every step of the way!      List of People in the Bible (Examples):      Cain:  When Cain saw that God liked his brother, Abel's offering more, Cain became envious and very angry. Cain murdered Abel and left him. God saw this and cursed Cain that he could never grow good crops and he made him be vanished away from his home forever. God left a mark on Cain's forehead so that every living thing would know what he'd done. Cain made a family in the land named Nod, which meant "Wandering".      Moses:  When Moses saw the Hebrew people worshipping Bel, Moses broke the Ten Commandments because he was infuriated by their wicked deed of idolatry (worshipping another God). Moses' chastisement for breaking the first laws of God given to Hebrews was he would pass away before they reached the Promised Land (The Land of Milk and Honey).    Also remember, it is God that helps give you control, not yourself!

						   Whenever I feel like there's no hope; like there's no end to all the miseries and pains of this world, I turn to the Lord with the thoughts of His return. Today, I've came across what St. Paul had wrote in Thessalonians 2, about problems that might be testing your faith-   All this is evidence that God's judgment is right, and as a result you will be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you are suffering. God is just: He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His powerful angels. He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed.    2 Thessalonians 1:5-10   So don't fret about this world, but do keep in mind of the Lord's Returning... For He come like "a thief in the night". And only those who will meet the Lord are those who look for Him. So, be forever mindful of him and know this- Don't put this aside ever, for the Lord will come when you least expect it.

						   Hello, this is my first post. Let me introduce this blog and of myself. First, myself- My Name is Tiffany B. (I usually don't give my last name). I am a teenager and a Christian...or more precisely a Catholic. All I can really say is that I'm a normal everyday person. Well, at least I think I am or I'd like to think that. J/K. =P Anyway, I will write in this blog whenever I feel there is a need to. I'll have to say that I've had blog's before and I never seem to really use them. Also, I must say that I probably won't be writing in this blog after a couple of years. I'll be busy in my studies of wanting to become a nun, evangelist, or a missionary; which of them I don't know what I should choose of. So, with out further a due... Here's my blog with my inner thoughts and such! ^^
