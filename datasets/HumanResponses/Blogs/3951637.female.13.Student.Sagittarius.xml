      Do you ever notice when you wake up you sorta stagger around...how do you know you are really awake? Sometimes when you wake up and maybe you couldnt sleep the night before do you ever wonder what time or how you feel asleep? Its wierd. The other night ..now this will sound wierd. It was sorta late but I was wide awake so I grabbed a book,I read the whole book and put it away and thats the last thing I remember..bout a few hours later my dad gets up and I relize my neck hurts so I wake up I am on the floor by the couch with the head like twisted around the leg like maybe how I had fallen from the couch. But then I relize that I had been wearing boxers and I was now in pj pants! I looked at the clock it was  4 am in the morning I was so confused! So I looked at my dad and told him he said he thought I was sleeping on the floor because it had been a hot night and it would be cool on the floor..he is so blind heeh! Anyways so I was like nO! Anyways I was wide awake after that and couldnt sleep I stayed up the whole night just watchin tv or play computer games, but the next day was fathers day so we went out to brunch at like 10 am so I was all ready right away. So we got done with brunch about 12 and so I got home and crashed for like 2 hours then got dressed again because my dad was making a huge dinner and all my siblings were coming over even though he said that he refused to make it because it was his day to relax but that never happens and we all know that!!! Anyways they came over ate and ran basically,except my brother and hes the best hes married and they are the coolest!!! So my dad had a good fathers day after all just being able to see all of his kids together.....see how well i go from sleeping to fathers day in one blog thang! This is cool! Signin off!

So next thing I notice we are at the store..Wahoo ...I dont want to think about school! Anyways we got all my stuff. Binder, Folders,pens,pencils whatever. But it was cool because I didnt have to find stuff that was picked over. But its wierd is summer over ..or is there still sum left? Yeah know I am going into 8th exciting ..but before ya know it ..HIGHSCHOOL! Why when you hit 5th/6th grade the year is like gone. These days memories seem so limited. I donno I am just a kid but I feel like I am being pushed into adulthood to quickly!. Choose, good and bad. I donno Life  tears ya apart! But ya always have friends! I am so happy I have such great friends to help me though school and this rough time that we call the teenage years!

      I went to my friend lucys play. She was the main role. The play was entitled "The Dear Edwina Show" She was Edwina. It was a musically. She went to a camp for a month and it was an acting camp and at the end of the camp the parents day I guess you could say they put on the play for the public. They learn to project their voice and blocking and all of this great acting knowlegde. It seems really fun. I do a bit of acting not that great but I try. Lucy is a great singer and actress she did so good in the play. I really enjoied watching and seeing the play. Acting is a great thing it opens people up. I enjoy it because you can become sum one you arent because you just need to excape sometimes!

      My best bud I have known for 11 years, went and got a photo with George Bush when he went to Washington DC, now its funny my friend hates the man..I mean so do I what a creep. Anyways I mean I dont care for him myself.....but he got ragged on so much cuz he is so anti-bush and there he goes and gets photo with the man! But really put yourself in his shoes, if you were there and offered to pose with the president would u say no? I dont think I would even if he is driving our country into the ground. From what I gather hes prolly a nice guy in the wrong job...well hell we all know&nbsp; he is in the wrong job but ya know! I will try to put the picture somewhere on my blog!
