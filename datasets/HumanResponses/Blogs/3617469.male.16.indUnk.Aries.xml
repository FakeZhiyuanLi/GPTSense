       Today, I discovered that several people that sit around me in my class enjoy muttering to themselves the answer they thought was right as the professor asks a question.  This nearly always turns out to be incorrect and they mutter "oh yeah..." and nod their heads as if they really got it.  See Diagram A (a real picture).  It turns out I am surrounded by idiots who can't seem to find any other way to keep themselves sane through the class than to mutter wrong answers.  I assume they think it makes them seem smarter, when it really has the opposite effect.  The guy behind me is indian and the only thing stopping me from going off on him is that I want him to do a "You kick my dog" impression. :P  Diagram A:

       I am giving away Gmail accounts to the person who sends me the most interesting/funny/awesome picture (drawn or edited).  Send it to jonathanbindel@gmail.com and claim your new account.  Either that or die cause nobody loves you.

       I just bought two domain names for DC# (www.dcsharp.com and www.dc-sharp.com) from GoDaddy.com.  Don't buy from them. They will scam you.  Read below for the survey I filled out.   urlLink     Click for full view.     Comments box:  The particular representative I spoke with was trying to scam me.  First of all, he said that the domains were $5.95 each and then after I told him the information on the domains I wanted, he said "Oh... the domains are actually $7.95 each."  I would gladly pay that price, but I am not satisfied that sales representatives would lie to me to earn more money.  Also, after he has registered the domains, he said, "GoDaddy.com protects your information, but all of your personal information you just gave me is going to be publicly published on the DNS lookup.  However, you can buy our privacy service for $9.95.  I highly recommend this to protect all the personal information you game me."  I do not appreciate being scammed.  I ended up not buying the privacy service because he waited until after I gave him my information.  Otherwise, I would've considered it, but I don't support scams.  I am very dissatisfied with this occurrence at GoDaddy.com.

       Well, today started off really bad... I woke up to late for my class that I go early to just because my mom has to take my 8 year old brother somewhere else.  So, she ended up taking him first since I wasn't ready (I was eating cereal because I didn't eat dinner the night before).  Then when she came back and took me, I didn't have enough time to finish the test and had to turn it in as it was.  After class, I waited a good half hour for the bus to come,  all the while getting bit by mosquitos (I counted 4 bites, each huge and very itchy) and then I got on it and went home.    Just check out the wait...     I decided to wait until a stop sign closer to my house to get off so I wouldn't have to walk as far because I was wearing a black shirt, but the sun didn't seem to care.  The bus driver informed me that he couldn't stop as the stop sign and he went on driving about a mile away from my house.  Finally, he chose a busy road to stop not at a stop sign, but in the middle, just to hold up traffic.  Then I walked a mile back in the blistering sun, praying that my mom had left the garage door open (she usually leaves while I am at my class and last time, she didn't) so that I could get in.  After t he long walk I got home to find out that my mom had tryed to pick me up.  There is a long list of people who deserve to die and bus drivers are on top.

       For some reason, starting yesterday, when I press right shift(I love this button...its much better than left shift) + any key, I get a new browser that pops up.  This means I can't do all the shortcuts I've been using since the shift key was invented.  No shift+home, no shift+end, no shift+click, no question marks, no curly braces, no quotation marks.   There are twice the keys with shift.  Fix my problem and I'll buy you a donut... did I mention jelly? :P

          Get a free 20GB iPod or 4GB iPod Mini!!!   step 1, sign up:     urlLink  http://www.freeipods.com/default.aspx?referer=7319816       step 2: see site on how to get a free ipod   urlLink http://www.freeipodguide.com     This looks like a scam but do it anyways cause I want my iPod.  A lot of people have shown pictures of theirs with a shipping receipt so check those out on the guide if you want.    Basically, you sign up (use an email you don't use often cause they send offers to do), you do an offer (do ebay cause its free, if you don't already have an account, otherwise, you gotta pay a little money (I think the cheapest one is $7), but you can cancel and it is never billed), then send it to 5 of your friends (they have to sign up and do an offer) and then they ship you a Brand New iPod.

       Today, I went to IHop with my dad and we got sat next to Ben, a guy who  was sitting by himself.   During our meal, he kept looking  over and listening in to our conversation...it was kinda weird.   But we allowed him to keep listening in since we assumed he was  celebrating his graduation from stalker school.  So, congrats Mr.  Party of one, as your table is now ready.

       Note: the prize will be decided based upon who the winner is.  I walked 283 steps before my pants feel off for the first time (right before a cop saw).  I kept walking (after I pulled em back up) and they fell down 3 more times on the way home.  There is nothing more refreshing than almost having a cop see you with your pants down.  So, congratulations David Bindel of San Marcos, TX.  You get nothing just because you suck.  Enjoy :)

       My favorite pair of jeans are baggy, enough to make me wear a belt whenever I choose to wear them.  This brought into my mind an amusing competition as I have to go up a huge hill that peaks after about a mile, when walking home from my class.  Whoever guesses closest to the number of steps I must walk without a belt before my pants fall all the way down will win a prize that will be decided upon later.  I hope the cops don't see (there are a lot of them on this hill).  The walk-off is next friday, so reply with your guesses (and be sure to post your name so I know who you are).

       I'm required to get SQL server for my job so I decided that I should go the extra step and just get all of Microsoft's products while I was at it.  That's right kids I am buying MSDN Universal.  I get every single thing good that Microsoft has made (notice, that limits what I'm getting by a high factor).   urlLink Check out all the crap I get .  I also get anything cool that I want before Microsoft releases it.  They even throw in a year's supply of Microsoft Brand Toilet Paper.  Basically, I am awesome.  The End.

       I was playing on my drum set last week, part of my bass pedal broke off.  I decided that I should probably go with a double bass pedal for replacement.  So, in my quest to find a new pedal, I was suggested the Tama Iron Cobra Flexi Glide.  This pedal has everything I want and looks beautiful.  It uses Kevlar straps instead of chains and its a lot better because of it.           I was also suggested the Iron Cobra Lever Glide HiHat stand, which also uses Kevlar.  $150 but worth it cause mine sucks and this one's just awesome.     Together these pedals are $420 at Musician's Friend.   urlLink Paypal some money and help me get them quicker .  Do It!!

       Well my life is much simpler now. I finished economics and speech at ACC. So, there is a lot less to worry about. I have had band camp every day now for about two weeks and everyday I come home sore and tire. But that will all be much better in a few days cause school's starting. With school comes less band camp, more seeing friends, and homework. So its a pretty big tradeoff, but I think its worth it because band camp is killing me. Today, we were marching our show with our drums on (I play tenors so thats another 45lbs to carry) and we have to get really really far in a very short time period, while playing. This is much harder than it sounds and after a few times of doing it, the entire drumline was about to have heart attacks. So, I've come to a conclusion that school is actually a good thing and it gives you a much longer life expectancy if you are in band (especially drumline).
