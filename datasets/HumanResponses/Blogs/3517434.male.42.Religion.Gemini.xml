      Well I'm not much at this at this kind of thing, but you never know until you try..right?  I will use this page for a Journal, you know, stuff written by me from day to day. Stuff like feelings, hopes & dreams, wishes and such stuff as that. I could write my personal testimony, but I already have on another page HERE!  so thats really not necessary.First I would like to save I'm proud to be a child of the King, The Lord God Almighty I was born again in 1988 at the age of 25, & I'm so glad I made that choice almost 16 years ago for many, many reasons. Peace of mind means a lot to me when laying down at night knowing if you were to die; Heaven will be your eternal home Amen! Maybe I could add some nice poems here, and Quotes...ya!  Until next time over & out!

      This is kind of hard to keep up with things in your everyday life, mostly if your like me and live "online" most of the time. But maybe writing things down helps the day go faster, hope so! It's early moring here at home, snow is on the ground, (again)..seems to be a hard and cold winter this year. Today makes 1 month I haven't been outside my home, it's not to me a bad thing..but I do know I should get out more, even if it's just for a breath of fresh air, ya know. Today I plan on updating some things on my other website like the Navigation, tag-borad colors, and a few other things that would help the look and feel of my site. I joined (another Christian singles site) today that I'm kind of up-beat about, even though I know nothing will come from it because none of the others have, but I keep trying to find a good looking Godly woman my age that is truly interested in me and what I'm about. Believe me, there is very few women out there Christian or not that would be interested in getting to know a man who lives in a wheel chair all day...I'm I right? Until next time over & out!

      I just talked on the phone with an online friend of mine, I miss her and I haven't ever met her in person. She recently moved to Southern "Alaska" from Ohio, she is living with this guys parents. But this guy and her "will" be married soon I just know it, and I will be happy and glad for her. Tomarrow is Valentines day (again) and I'm alone yet another year, guess I shouldn't be surprised by that..but I want someone to love and to be loved by someone. But I dont really think it's going to happen is this life time, but I still keep holding on.. hoping and wishing with my heart I'll soon met *the one* for me. To all you who have that special Valentine, feel blessed that you have each other to share and be with. Until next time, Over & out!

      Hey, it's been awhile..been swiching tag-boards around trying to find the right look I want. Not much luck tho-..there's this young guy thats been giving me some really good tips and tricks on how to acheive the look you want. Well, as far as females..NO luck there at all, there are so many single women my age out there but this stooopid wheelchair always gets in my way. I have almost given up on looking for marriage now, I'm getting older everyday and I'm sure not getting know more Goood LOOKS on my side of the yard, ya know. Well,  maybe I'll die before the age of 45, thats only a few more years to go from now, since I'll be 42 this June..dang, I am getting old. I'm going to try and write more than what I do, but sometimes I just ant got anything positive to say..so I mostly just pass the day without writing one word. I'll see how it works out, and be more writeable than I have lately. Until next time over & out!

      Many people spend the whole of their lives searching for that elusive secret to their own success. Often the so-called 'secret' is sitting right under their very nose. Let's face it, unless you're naturally gifted, making a success of anything involves a whole lot of hard work. A lot of the time, the work we're faced with is often boring and monotonous. Wouldn't it be great if it were fun? Ding, dong! Are the lights starting to flash, and bells starting to sound inside your head yet? I'm tempted to carry on rambling at this stage, but I know you are just itching to find out what a GOOBI is. Am I right? Well, I'll put you out of your misery right now! GOOBI is simply a mnemonic for Get Out Of Bed Inducer. It's that thing that gets you out of bed in the morning and puts a spring in your step. It has also been described elsewhere, as your "Friday night essence." Think about it, what would you happily spend Friday night working on instead of dining with friends or watching a movie? I was reminded of the GOOBI concept recently, whilst watching a film. The title of the film escapes me, which is probably best because it was rubbish. If I was to tell you the title you'd only go watch it, and then you'd be saying, "Why did he mention that film? It was rubbish!" Anyway, at one point in the film, the leading character made a statement that struck a chord with me. He said "The secret to success is to find something you love doing, and do it for the rest of your life!" Of course, he was talking about finding your GOOBI. So here comes the hard part. To find your GOOBI you have to start thinking for yourself. I know that bit is going to come as a shock to some of you, as a lot of people will go to the ends of the earth to avoid thinking for themselves. Isn't it just a lot easier to run with the flock and let the shepherd and his dog make all the decisions for you? If you've just answered "Yes" to that last part, then all I have to say to you is "Baaah!". For those of you who don't speak Sheep, roughly translated this means "You'd be better off grazing with the flock, you haven't got what it takes. "If you think that thinking is hard, you ain't seen nothing yet! (Authors note: "Think that thinking is hard"... Is it me or does that have chicken and egg connotations? Never mind, hopefully you see my point. Let's get back to the plot.) What do you really love to do? It's a simple question, so don't try to make it a hard one. We're talking about constructive exercises here so don't cheat by saying "Nothing." Anyway, I'm sure you would get bored doing absolutely nothing for the rest of your life. The answer you come up with should be your true vocation. If you're totally honest with yourself, and if you do the thing you love for the rest of your life, you can't fail to be successful. You'll literally do anything you need to do, to carry on doing what you love to do. Hey, have I just invented a new tongue twister, or another piece of nonsense rhyme? So, go find your GOOBI! You know it makes sense, which after reading what I've just written, is more than I do. Does this may any sense ?? Oh well.. Until next time, Over & out!

      The day after Valentines, what do you know..I survived yet another year all alone. It wasn't that bad, there was a lot of love stories on TV; and I did set up late and watch a few tear jurkers. That helps me sometimes, even if it's not a happy ending, just watching others feeelings is suffient. It started snowing here this afternoon and has snowed 3 to 4 inches of the white stuff already, hope the heavy snow doesn't bring all these shade trees crashing done on my house. But so far so good, I think the worst has passed us by, but a lot of people are going to get a lot of snow. Over and out til next time!

      Hey, it looks like the weather forecasters called it right, I'd say right now we have a good 8 inches and it's still pouring down. It's that wet heavy type of snow, all the tree limbs are weighted down low to the ground..this worries us because 1 year 98 I think it came a big wet heavy snow and trees and power lines went down, this place was a mess! Power was off 5 days and thats a tuff scenario considering my disability, but luckily we did have wood heat and that kept us warm anyways, but NOW we dont have that, so if the power goes off we'll get cold in here...and thats not a good thing!!!! Outside my window here the Birds are feeding heavy on the four Super Feeders I have hung in our front yard, lots of colors out there blending with all the white snow, the red Cardinals are my favorite, I think all these thieving squirrels are getting most of the seed, but hey..they gotta eat too. My sister Sherry is sick with a fever, she thinks she may have the Flu..I hope n pray not, it's been a pretty bad season for the Flu around here, but had tappered off some we "thought"..well there's not as many missing in Church now as there was back in Dec. & Jan...I hope she will get well soon. Over & out til next time!

      It's suppose to snow and snow hard here tonite and tomarrow, forecast calls for 4 to 6 inches, that's not to much but enough for me..an when will summer get here?..June 21st I guess. I'm kind of glad I started a journal, it's kind of neat to go back and read stuff you wrote a month ago, hope I stay healthy enough to keep on keeping on writing, it's slow typing with a stick in your mouth, you should try it sometime..lol. I found another poem / story that's a little scary, or funny to me, I'll let you read it here....This story is a Japanese urban legend. (Don't worry, it's not too gory)  KUCHISAKE ONNA   One evening, a girl met a woman who had a red coat and a big white mask on her mouth on her way home from school. The woman asked "Do you think I'm beautiful?" The girl could not see clearly the woman's face because of her mask. However, the girl thought that the woman was quite beautiful. The girl answered obediently "Yes, you are beautiful." Suddenly, the woman asked again "Am I really beautiful?" while taking off the mask. The woman's mouth split open to her ear. The girl ran out of fear and escaped from the area. However, the woman pursued the girl with terrible speed. The woman caught up with the girl easily. The woman said "I want to do for you what was done to my face." The woman had a big sickle hidden. Then, the woman split the girl's mouth with the sickle...She was most active in 1979 from spring to summer. Her name was very famous around Japan just only for that term. It seems that mistake was made when she was in surgery. That is to say, she was a real person. However, she suffered abnormal conditions in her soul from the shock when her mouth split, and people did not know why she came to attack children. She stood in the shadow of a telegraph pole in the evening. Then, she asked "Am I beautiful?" when children passed in the area. If you answered "yes", she would take off the mask, and ask again. However, if you answered "no", she also took off the mask, and she said "I want to do for you what was done to my face." After all, you could not be safe whether you answered good or bad. Then, she pursued with terrible speed the children. According to a report, seemingly, she could run 100m in only 3 seconds. They could not run away. She instantly caught them and she split them with a sickle, kitchen knife or razor. To tell the truth, she did not have unusual attributes. It was only a simple story about an unusual person who attacked a child.

      Been looking for a few poems I like, and there is so many out there; it's difficult to pick out just one that I really really like so I thought maybe add just a few I thought was appling to me. I'm waiting for my ship which hasn't yet come in; but in my heart I know it won't be long, for even as I pine of this dream boat on my mind, the echo of its steam horn sings my song! Now, in my anxious view as I gaze across the blue, I see her silhouette against the sky: where across horizon's zone with a cargo all my own, she's bringing home to me - "my piece of pie!" There! beyond the foam, I glimpse her coming home steaming on to fill these goals of mine. I'm caught up in a trance and the butterflies all dance as she speeds along across the brine. And soon I'll ride her bow and we'll sail on here and now and brush away the ocean's spray; and when she carries me to my port of destiny I'll be king of my domain -as winners say! Well this one I really really liked, but I know diffrent people like diffrent things. You know if we were all the same this would be one big lonely planet.  Over and out til next time!!

      I've been trying to decide on a diffrent lay out on my website, homestead has a lot of themes to choose from I just cant make my mind up on which one..maybe I'll choose this theme looks good to me. I think I'll put this nice poem on here I found, I like it and hope you do.....  Searching For A Soul  A long time ago, when the world was young, man does not look like the way he is now. God created man with four arms, four legs, two heads and are joined on the side so they have only one HEART. For the time the earth is peaceful. As the Earth grew a little older, the people began to quarrel. One cannot go where he wanted to go somewhere else. Soon everyone will quarrel. GOD saw this problem so he made a great thunderbolt and sent it to earth. Now everybody is separated. Each person now has his own body and his own free will to do anything he wants. But there is something missing... his partner.... Now he spends most of his life searching for his lost life, searching for his lost partner ....... his soulmate ..... Everyone is until now ....I sure hope God brings my soul-mate soon, until next time over & out!

      I really like this story / poem, 4 more days until I sit in front of a bunch of Christian folk teaching God's word..ask me if I'm nervous or scared..I'd have to say NO Sir, I sure ant not one bit..hope you enjoy this. I have been forgiven, of all my ugly sins I have been forgiven, I've been washed clean within My Dear LORD has saved me, from sin, and guilt, and shame Yes! I have been forgiven, I praise GOD'S holy name I am a "New Creation", my heart's YESHUA'S throne HE walks with me, and talks with me, I never am alone Yes, I have been forgiven! And I must do the same!!! All others now, I must forgive, in YESHUA'S name I must forgive those people, who crushed and broke my heart As I forgive, YESHUA will give me a "brand new start" I must forgive, and break the chains, that bind me hard and fast As I forgive, I'll be released, and I'll be Free at last I must forgive, no matter what, and with GOD'S help, I can I must forgive, and HE will make me, all that HE has planned YESHUA, helps me overcome, HIS Love is all I need I can forgive all others, as HE'S forgiven me I will forgive, and gladly, I'll give it all to GOD; HE is the Judge of all the earth, for HIM, nothing's too hard I will forgive, and not give place, for satan to come in I will forgive immediately, and not give way to sin "I have been forgiven", can I do any less? I will forgive, and know for sure, my LORD in Love will Bless "I have been forgiven, and I will do the same" YESHUA is the Victory, all Glory to HIS NAME

      The weather here has really been changing the last week or so, last week we got a foot of snow, that melted the very next day. Today it's a nice sunny 80 degree day, wow what a change, this type of weather is what makes folks sick. Good news, Sunday I ask my Sunday school Teacher about teaching for him sometime, so today he called me and ask me if I could teach our class on the 14th of this month, ofcoarse I said yes..he kept talking and said he really needed an assitant teacher to give him a break every now and then, and ask if I would maybe consider that, I said sure..it would be an honor to do what I can for the Lord Jesus. I have never taught in any class before, never in my entire life have I, it goes without saying I'm very excited about teaching the largest adult class in our Church! But God knows I cannot do anything without him, & I know that as well, so I'll just let God speck his word through me. Website should be up and running by tomarroow if nothing BIG happens, so until next time over & out!

      Happy happy, I tell you sitting up there in front of all those people..I can see how some would be nervous, but I really wasn't! The Pastor hooked me up with his Mic so all could hear..I have a soft voice without much volume, but his microphone took care of that. I took the thing I read my Bible on at home with me, my brother in-law made it for me years ago and everything went fine. I read some Scripture, told a lot about my personal relationship with Christ and how I meet Him as Lord and Savior of my life. The class is 30 minutes long and it went fast while I was up there, had a lot of my family to come visit our Church just to see me...the old brother crip sitting up front teaching, it was great, and many people came up to me after words and said I had blessed them by teaching in a wheelchair. I'm not sure if or when brother Darrell will ask me to teach again, that's God's work..but if ask I will do it again..teaching is great and that was my very first time and it felt wonderful to have that opportunity to do more for my Lord Jesus. I know I haven't written a lot this month, but stuff happens that you have know control over. I also have my domain name now and it will always be  urlLink www.jeffreborn.com  I like that name, kind of tells a little about who and what I am. Until next time Over & out!

      Some filthy creep has been posting pornographic material in my guest-book, so I had to get a new and much better one which lets me screen each message before they show in the guest book; which is a good thing really. I tried to take it and act in a Christian way, but they / he / her kept posting it over and over until I was getting tired of deleting so many of them...I guess I should have just deleted them and left it alone. But as usual I let the fleshly part take over and I wrote , thought, and said some things I know I shouldn't have. I guess they were as tired of posting the filth as I was deleting it, because it has slowed a bit, maybe they saw the new and improved guest book and just thought just leave well enough alone..these are the people who really need Christ in there hearts and lives, and I truly hope one day before it's to late that they will turn from there wicked ways and receive Christ. The weather here has been incredible, yesterday it got u^p to 80 degrees, 1 degree short of the all-time high record, which is 81 set back in 1944..that's a while back huh..I close with the scripture in mind and heart.."I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me" Until next time over & out.

      Well it's been awhile since I last wrote here, nothing much to say lately. Last Sunday the lady who teaches he "Mothers" class ask me if I would like to teach her class after Easter, I said sure..just let me know when to prepair for it. So I get to teach again, and to me it's a blessing to teach any chance I get. I really dont know what I could teach these older Mothers but I'll just let the spirit of God lead me to where and what to teach about. Temperture here has been well into the 70's for a week or so, trees are starting to bud out, the Pear trees are full of blooms and there beautiful to see. I hope the whole world has a very Happy and blessed Easter,..until next time over & out!

      Been awhile since I updated my journal, just haven't felt much like writing..guess it's a quad thang I get way to often. Was suppose to have a visitor today, but it was canceled .. reasons out of my control, was really excited about this visit, but maybe another day and time I'll get that visit. I have meet a few really nice ladies online, to email and chat with, and talked to a couple of them on the phone .. you know at my age you just cant meet any single women that's not been married and divorced at less once already, some multiple times. Mothers day was a blast, for mom anyways .. I wound up getting stuck in my chair almost flipping over, but heck you got to have a little adventure in life, and getting stuck in my chair and almost flipping it was I guess a little adventurous for me. (smile)! I really like my new Ford Van, boy .. Chevy and Ford are really different when it comes to Vans, the Ford is smaller than the Chevy, but has a larger engine 351 vs. the Chevy having a 305, but the new Ford Van has more head clearance, floor must be lower because I can see a lot more out of the Ford Van which is a big plus. Write later folks, until the next time..over and out!

      Not much going on since I last updated on here, just not a whole lot happening right now. I did get to order my new wheelchair, sure did take long enough to get the ball rolling on it, but it's on it's way now. It's an odd looking chair with 6 wheels, the two small wheels in the front and he back are for suspension, and the mid wheels are the ones that drive. With this chair I will be able to go across ruff terrain, such as stumps big rocks and pot hot in the road and grass, and considering the place I live it should be more efficient than this simple roadster I'm in now. Had a phone call last night, it was someone I have met before but it has been nearly a year since I last saw her, but we have kept in touch with each other the time in between visits. Gives me something to look forward to this weekend, maybe if I'm lucky I'll get a long awaited "hug and kiss". This is just a thought I found on the net and it really makes a lot of sense to me, so here it is....   .:The Tongue:.  It is a helpful tool, that is used as a dangerous weapon, it is so light yet we fail to hold it.... Instead of using it as a magic wand to tap a bit of encouragement upon one's heart or a smile upon one's face, we use it as a sword to cut people down leaving their hearts broken and their self-esteem low.... Instead of using it to turn ourselves into little angels placing blessings upon one's life, we use it to turn ourselves into fire-breathing dragons who insists on one's life being taken.... We use it to curse others not realizing we are really cursing ourselves, we must learn to hold this dangerous weapon before we kill others as well as ourselves.... We must learn to watch the words that we allow to roll off of it, we must allow it to be known as a piece of gold from heaven instead of the flames from hell... just a thought. Until next time over & out!

      I finally have my new web host and I'm moving from (HomERstead)   ..I really don't like the way homestead is acting during this transfer, there acting like children, I mean for 3 years I've been with them and now that I'm leaving there crying like babies..lol...Thats to bad for them not me, (mt) Media Temple is far superior than homestead and there is much more I'll be able to do within (mt), & so I'm a little bit happy, even-though it's going to take 12 to 72 hours to be completed.    .::Change of subject::.Women, ya cant live with them & you darn sure cant live without them, I mean whats a poor quad to do. Most women have that time of month, but man they can act  really really  strange sometimes, like you don't even know them. The weather here is mid 80's sunny and beautiful, I really need to get out more and enjoy this bright sunshine, summer is so short and then we have all those months of icy cold winds and just Brrrr all winter.

      Looks like I'll be getting a new web host very soon, I tried to get this *free* tag board to work but it has to work using .php which (homestead) doesn't support..a real bummer. I found another host (mt) Media Temple that supports almost everything but homestead has a lock on my domain name and I really don't know what to do about that unless I get another domain registered with (mt) media temple which I think I will do. I spent a lot of time and $-money-$ building my website and keeping it updated is a chore but I like doing that kind of stuff, always learning something new and better than what you think you have. I'll keep you posted about how things go with all of it, until next time over & out! Ps- I taught another class at Church last Sunday & it was a real blessing to me even with  the very short notice I had.

      Another year gone by with my life in a wheelchair, I have watched 16 of these years go by and seems nothing really ever changes about me. Been a lot of well known's to die this past week, including former President Ronald Reagan, nice man but not much of a President IMHO..then Ray Charles died also, he had wrote and sang some really good songs in his lifetime, he truly lived the American dream. Then a guy I knew only on-line as (jaes) died of an apparently mis-overdose of he medication, he was a fellow member of  urlLink New Mobility  , a community and message board for the disabled folks like me, RIP jaes. As for me and my birthday, I plan on getting out in the sunshine today, maybe visit my brother and his family. Happy wheeling, until next time over & out!

      WoW! This morning at Church it was election time for the Teachers and various other positions. So when class started a man other than our teacher stood up and ask if we were ready to elect our teachers, and we were and our Teacher Darrell was re-elected for another year. Then he ask, now for your assistant teacher, I figured we would re-elect Ralph as our assistant for another year also. But one lady and another gentlemen said that they nominate Jeff (me), I was really shocked by that. He then asked me if I was willing to take on that position of being the assistant teacher, so I thought for just a second and said sure I will, and so I was elected to be our new assistant Sunday School Teacher of the adult class. So I guess I can plan on doing a lot more Bible study than usual, but I am humbled to be a man elected to speck the words of God and to teach Jesus Christ..all in all a great day. Over and out until next time!

      I had a really nice visit with my now  "girl friend Joy"  this past weekend, a really great visit indeed. She brought her 9 year old son on this visit and I think he enjoyed himself while here, Joe (his name) is a well behaved boy, but I could tell he's all boy inside. Sunday we had a picnic for my Dad (Fathers Day) which Dad really enjoyed all the family together and gifts he recieved. All my family was there and  Joy and Joe  fit right in, like they already are part of our family, it was a very nice and sunny day and all the kids went swimming in the icy mountain pool. We grilled hamburgers and hotdogs and I ate way to much, I have know idea when she may visit me again, but I sure hope it's not very long from now, I miss her even now. Until next time over & out!!

      Yes..    It's still raining and the forecasters are calling for rain all week long, through Wednesday of next week...Yuck. Well, the grass is really looking nice and green, but you cant find a dry day to cut it, so it's getting taller everyday. Legendary Actor Marlon Brando died yesterday, he was 80 but he had some really good movies in his time..The God Father..et cetera,. &  HEY STELLA  !!!!    LOL..remember that one very well. Not much happening at the time, so over and out until next time.

      I sure hope this month is much more warmer and sunnier than last month, it rained the whole month of June. I'm thinking about making my on Journal on my website, it would be by my design, my colors and just be better I think. Keep me in your thoughts and prayers as I continue preparing to teach Sunday, just ask the Lord to give me the words that he would have me to speck and His will be done, thank you. Until next time over and out!

      Gotta say this ant been much of a summer and this is the last day of June, been raining a lot this whole month and not really that warm either. I can remember when I was a kid, and it seemed like way back then it got hot in May and stayed hot until the leaves fell off the trees. I guess were in some kind of a pattern where the gulf moisture is just pumping up the clouds and rain, or thats what it seems like to me. But I reckon we need all this rain or the good Lord wouldn't have gave it to us, strange that in the western states it's very hot and dry, and at the same time here in the eastern states were wet and not so hot, I mean it's 64 degrees right now.   Well, until next time over & out!

      I finally have my host,  urlLink   website   , and layout finished .. I cant believe how time consuming it has been. But I'm glad it's done, need to add more photos but everything seems to be A-OK. I hope the rest of this week goes better than the begining, especially weather wise, been cloudy windy and kinda cool for late June, lots of rain and very little sunshine. Well I better do some Bible study for my Sunday School class, not sure what I'll be teaching yet, be God will show me the way, it's good to be saved..Amen! Over & out until next time.  ps. Thanks for the kind comments I've recieved..bless you all :)
