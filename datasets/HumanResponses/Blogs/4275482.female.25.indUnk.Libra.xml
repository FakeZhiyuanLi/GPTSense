      Why is it that not half an hour ago, I was lying in bed, unable to sleep with thoughts racing like greyhounds through my brain, yet when I try and hash some of it out on my infant "blog", I come up empty-handed?  I guess I'm not accustomed to putting my thoughts out for the entire world to see (although I'm sure people aren't breaking down the proverbial doors to read this thing).    I feel like I'm marking time right now.  I'm not bored (time is passing surprisingly quickly, as a matter of fact) but I get the feeling that everything I'm doing now is in preparation for something else.  Which is not necessarily a bad thing, as my uber-prepared-for-anything-and-everything mother would most likely tell me, but I feel like I'm only 50 percent present most of the time.  The other 50 percent of my mind is occupied with the racing thoughts (see above).  Luckily most are excited thoughts (as in, "I'll be in France in less than a month!") but tonight they were of a more anxious variety (as in, "I'll be in France in less than a month!").  I guess I should just live in the moment and not worry so much.  In other news...I figured out how to add links to my "blog" (can that word be any uglier?) which I am way too excited about...especially since I know absolutely nothing about web design or html.   There's only one so far, a link to a webring for other assistants in France, which you should check out because we are the coolest!

      Well, I guess I better post something, now that I have created this monster.  As you can tell, things are pretty bare-boned right now, but hopefully once I figure out how to use this damn thing it will look a little nicer.  I'm not too crazy about the black-and-white dealio, but it was the best option available.  (No purple templates, in case you were wondering.  Although for those of you who know me, you probably weren't).  It is midnight in Eugene, Oregon right now.  I just got back from the Lane County Fair where none other than THE DOOBIE BROTHERS performed LIVE and in concert.  (This was my parent's idea).  Although I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  I never realized I knew so many DB songs.  Kind of like when I saw a free Bryan Adams concert and knew the words to practically every song...it was a little scary, actually.  All right, back to trying to figure out how to make things prettier...not that anyone is breaking down my door to read my blog (blog, snog, hog) but anyway...  Good night, all.
