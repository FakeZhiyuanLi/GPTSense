      The countdown has begun!  Well, truthfully I've been counting down since May...but now we're finally getting to the "lessthanoneweek" mark.  This time next week I will be in Mexico.  I am so incredibly excited and nervous all at the same time!  God has done such amazing things for me to be a part of this team.  I'm going to copy an email that I sent to several friends yesterday that gives just one example of God's incredible faithfulness. Amazing thing happened today that I just had to share!  As we all know, we're getting down to the wire on our support for Mazatlan, so I have to admit, I started panicking a bit.  I knew it would all come in somehow, but at the same time, I couldn't figure out how.  I'd been praying about it a lot and just trusting that the Lord would make provision, and He did in the most incredible way.  I do all of my freelance printing at Copy Solutions - a company that is all non-Christians except for one guy that does their deliveries - Don.  Every time Don drops something off we chat a bit and so lately our conversation has been on the upcoming trip to Mexico.  He asks me what we'll be doing there, how our preparations are going, how my support is coming, etc.  Well, today he walks into my office and hands me an envelope.  I look at it and with a puzzled look ask, "what is this?"  Don says, "We all pooled in some money for you to help with your trip."  I opened it and just started crying - because it covers the cost of the trip and allows me to take care of those odds and ends that I couldn't figure out how I was going to purchase.  Beyond that, an entire company of non-Christians gave generously for a missions trip - which is awesome for so many reasons, but I'm mainly excited for the door that it has opened.  When I get back from the trip I plan on sending a long thank you to everyone who supported me - just sharing all that happened and all that God has done on the trip.  This will be especially exciting to send to Copy Solutions because it opens up such an incredible opportunity to share with those guys in a greater way than I have ever been able to before.  When I told one lady at work (because I've been running around telling everyone!) she said, "When God wants you to go somewhere, He makes sure you can get there."  So true.  God orchestrated me going on this trip in ways that I never saw coming...and He remains faithful all the way through!  So, for anyone else who is still raising their support - be encouraged!!!  God is sooo faithful and full of amazing surprises! :)  I'm sure this is just one of many amazing stories and I can't wait to hear the rest!  Have a blessed day!  Love you guys! Trish

      Hey guys!  I just created my own "blog".  I have to admit that I'm a bit "behind the times" since I'm a graphic designer and I've yet to have a webpage, but better late than never, right?  Well, the exciting news in my life right now is that I leave next Thursday at 4am for Mazatlan, Mexico with a team of 27 people from church - mainly youth and a handful of adults.  I am excited and terrified all at once - it's going to be amazing.  Check back in two weeks for some great pictures and stories!  Until then, take care and God bless! Trish
