         When things go wrong as they sometimes will, When the road you're trudging seems all up hill, When the funds are low and the debts are high And you want to smile, but you have to sigh, When care is pressing you down a bit, Rest, if you must, but don't quit.   Life is queer with its twists and turns, As everyone of us sometimes learns, And many a failure turns about When he might have won had he stuck it out, Don't give up though the pace seems slow, You may succeed with another blow.   Success is failure turned inside out, The silver tint of the clouds of doubt, And you never can tell how close you are, It may be near when it seems so far, So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit It's when things seem worst that you must not quit.

       I recieve lots of email about accelRO and askin me what happen to the server. Like what I said Im busy this past few weeks! and dont have time to manage and maintain the server. I love Ragnarok Online, that game is totally addicting, though sometimes I got bored but still I'll love to play it... I down the server for now!!! and I dont have any idea when it will be up... I know it's very disapointing, but I have my own life and not just to play and maintain the game for the whole day, I have lots of things to do... maybe I'll open the message board again and it will be your guide to find a new server... It's really a great time playing with you all folks! see you again someday! and have a blessed life for you all :)
