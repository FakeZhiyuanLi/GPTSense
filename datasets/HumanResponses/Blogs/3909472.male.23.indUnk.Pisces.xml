      I'm at Jocelyn's today before we leave to drive up to Providence. She is originally from New Haven, but currently resides in the amazingly trashy town of East Haven. She and her roommate live in a nice little beach house about a ten minute walk to the water, but at the same time they are surrounded on every side by some spectacular white trash.  The children here set off fireworks at all hours of the day and night, from Spring to Fall. They have no regard for passing automobiles, and if you try to drive down the street they'll stand and talk to each other in the middle of the road and turn to give a belittling evil eye or two because you would like to use the street for driving. You also need to keep a sharp eye out, because it's not uncommon to see a two-year-old child walking down the street alone.  The kids wear bathing suits throughout the year--as an outer garment.  Their parents wash their cars on the street and then get into their  own  bathing suits to use their autos as some sort of crude waterslide. They then stand there with tattoos covering their bodies and smoke a pack of cigarettes in ten minutes.  They have large piles of bulk trash in their back yards, along with one or more inoperable hot rods rusting away.  If you listen long enough (about 15 minutes) you're guaranteed to hear someone yelling at someone else.  Not just a yell, but a horrible, throaty, gurgling vociferation to either their spouse or child. Jocelyn was once at the beach and overheard a woman threatening to slap and then drown her child.  For you to appreciate how hilarious this is, you must consider Jocelyn and her roommate Terry in the midst of this madness. Two reserved, quiet and amiable young women fresh out of college, both second-year teachers. They're not immune to their surroundings, though. There's a lack of parking spaces on their street and they have no driveway, so they've taken to parking their cars on their lawn.

      This weekend Jocelyn and I are going to Providence to see  urlLink this :    It's a street festival in which 100 "braziers" along the canal are filled with wood and lit--creating a row of roaring fires that illuminate the streets and water for the entire night. Not to mention the weird music they play over the speaker system. Man, do I love weird music. Just don't tell Johnny Mac that I'm going, because last time I was there and didn't talk to him he was really hurt.    "Kid, Li'l Rhody and Blavis are like my two favorite things, dude."

      My friend Vanessa has been living a similar life to mine over the past year: working on her own business,  urlLink  Osorio Designs  , creating and selling clothing of her own making.  To supplement her income from  Osorio  she has been teaching SAT prep courses for The Princeton Review, and she recommended that I investigate doing the same.    So, I don't want to tell people what I got on my SATs when I was applying to college. People don't like to talk about that kind of thing. Let's just say it rhymes with "zourteen-blenty." While I certainly realized that a great amount of time had passed since I last thought about SAT questions, I figured that I would do alright on an online practice test.    Nope.    I've never been good at math.  I managed to get by in math when I was taking it every year in high school, but thanks to the freedom offered by liberal arts study, I felt very  free  to take as little as possible of it at Tufts. The results of my academic choices were starkly clear. As soon as I got past the good old analogies and vocabulary sections I literally felt my brain say, "Alright boys, let's pack it in because we sure as shit can't let him read and work on this stuff."    I could feel my brain spin down like a hard drive being turned off. (I'm a fucking nerd). I'm pretty sure that for about five minutes I was just staring at the screen of my computer, not reading, not thinking, barely even breathing. Luckily, my dog managed to hump my leg for a minute or two until I regained consciousness--sort of like an overly horny St. Bernard rescue.    Hello, my name is Travis, and I'm a mathophobe.

         If you did not see this speech last night, the video is  urlLink here  and it's definitely worth seeing. I admit I only first heard of him in US News about a month ago, but after hearing him speak I was sold. If he doesn't win the junior Senate seat, I'll be very surprised.

      Tomorrow I and the rest of the adults at our camp have been instructed to bring in our deodorants, antiperspirants, perfumes, febreezes and any other olfactory bamboozlers as props for a talk to our increasingly ripe 6th graders about the basics of personal hygiene.    Some of them really smell like ass.    I know that schools have programs for grades nearing puberty to talk about the changes that go on in our bodies--hair growth in surprising places, the maturation of reproductive systems, and general funkification--and I'm honestly surprised at some of the odors that are left in my classroom at the end of the day.    It's bad enough that my music room often smells, as Nicole so astutely observed, like a giant mouth.  Thirty kids shuffle in at a time to talk and sing for an hour, most having "forgotten" to brush their teeth in the morning (or in some cases, at night as well).  The humidity, the general lack of ventilation, the temperature reaching into the 80s and sometimes 90s, and of course the rampant halitosis make my classroom seem like one nasty oral cavity.    I can't let it become one giant armpit as well.

      I think I've heard that phrase about 30 times in the last day regarding the protesters that were supposed to be confined in such an area near the Fleet Center. They got a court order to allow them to take their protests outside of the fence, but let's be honest with ourselves: all I can think of when I hear those words is  urlLink that SNL sketch with Billy Bob Thorton.    "I think there's something I need to make clear about my fenced-in area. You see... everybody in Gilbert County's got a damn fenced-in area that's cluttered with crap and brown weeds invading them like a cancer! Well, see, I'm better than that. I'm gonna make my fenced-in area an area that's neat and special, with a special purpose. And then all the nayayers will have to say, 'Dammit! He really did something with his fenced-in area, and now I feel inspired to clean up my own fenced-in area!' And others will see my fenced-in area, and inspiration will go on and on and on, from person to person, just like that! [ reflective pause ] I want my fenced-in area to be an inspiration. And... if y'all can't understand that... then I was born in the wrong world."

      I almost forgot this one.  On Saturday morning our toilet was flushing rather slowly, but I, having things to do, decided to leave it and take a look when I came home later in the day.  When I finally got back that afternoon I found an overflowing toilet with shitty water spilling out of the bowl and onto the bathroom floor.  Little pieces of poop were scattered on the flooded tile.  After going to work with a crappy plunger for about thirty minutes, I decided I needed to go get some real tools and bought a professional plunger from Home Depot.  After another half hour working on the toilet with no results except for a bowl of strangely sudsy poop water, we called a plumber.  Using his plumber's snake he was able to get rid of the blockage, which turned out to be a whole, new bar of soap.  Somehow an entire bar of  Irish Spring with Aloe  had fallen into the toilet, been flushed, and then not been able to maneuver in the ensuing pipage.  The plumber looked at Nish as if he would have an answer for all of this, but he of course did not.  No one has confessed to knowing anything about this.  A bar of soap.  Fucking weird.

      So this place is going crazy.  It's virtually impossible to get anywhere in a car or via public transportation, so for once I'm pretty happy about being somewhat outside the fray up in Somerville.  Meanwhile, pols and celebrities alike are everywhere in caravans of SUVs followed by teams of SWAT snipers.   urlLink Kerry was at the Sox game tonight , which was funny because the national ESPN broadcast had a camera that just sat on him at all times.  When something would happen on the field, they would immediately cut to Kerry for his reaction, then to Ben Affleck (who ended an interview with a satellite reporter by blurting, "Ok.  Thanks for talking to me."), then to Katie Couric who looked generally enthusiastic but clearly confused.  I'm pretty sure that those three celebrities were on air more than the actual game.  The Sox won, though, so that's good for them, and for Johnny Mac who has a standing bet regarding the season series with New York:  If the Yankees win the season series, he has to buy his Yankee-fan female friend drinks all weekend.  If the Sox win it, he gets to play with her boobs for the entire weekend.  Go Sox.

      Yesterday on the T, as Nish, BJ and I rode the ridiculously packed car to Fenway Park, the strangest thing I've ever experienced in Boston occurred.  I was holding on for dear life to the bar that hung from the roof of our train car, which caused my t-shirt sleeve to slip toward my shoulder and thus exposed a bit of my upper arm.  Being of Irish, Scottish, Welch and German ancestry, my upper arm's hair follicles are sometimes red, especially after being in the sun.  This short young woman--so short that I barely knew she was behind me--hits Nish with the back of her hand rather forcefully, and then points to my arm, blurting out "is that a rash?"  Nish of course had no way of responding to this so he just stood there, staring blankly back at her.  She then poked me with her bony little finger and asked the same question, "Excuse me, is that a rash?"  My first reaction was to explain my skin heritage, but right before I began to do so I realized that she was  fucking crazy , so I managed to reply under my breath "umm...no..." and immediately turned away.  She seemed satisfied with my answer, as she didn't feel the need to jab Nish or myself to further the conversation.

       	 		 		 We have two package deals for Red Sox tickets, which means that we usually sit around the same people at games in a specific ticket package.  Last night, for the second time this season, I hung out with my buddy Nate.  He's four years old, and his dad takes him to about eight games a year at Fenway Park.  Nate is obsessive about his team.  He knows what players wear what numbers, and he can pronounce even the toughest names almost perfectly.  Nate's obsessiveness does not end with the Red Sox, however.  The first game we were at he managed to get a hand on one of the beach balls that was bouncing around in the outfield.  From that point on, and and for the next six innings, all he could talk about was getting another beach ball, hitting a beach ball, and where the beach balls were right now.  He'll ignore the game completely and focus instead on the handful of beach balls circulating around the bleachers.  When one gets anywhere close to us, he pretty much loses it and starts yelling about how much he hopes that we get one to hit.  He'll sit there and point across the field, all the way to the third base line seats and talk about how there's a ball down there, and that MAYBE it will come all the way around the stadium to us.  When we finally got a ball or two, BJ or I held it up for him to hit--something he did so quickly that we were usually still in mid-sentence telling him to hit the ball by the time it was five rows away.  He just couldn't wait.  When I told him that we had one more game in those seats, in September, and that my friends and I want to bring a bunch of beach balls to that game, his eyes opened wide and he leaned over to me, whispering "and you could bring one for ME?!" 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Nate 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink travtufts .

      Politicians have forever kissed babies, taken photo ops with hoards of children, and paraded their own progeny to cameras while on the campaign trail.  The Bush daughters are working on their father's re-election team.  John Edwards' children were shoved in front of so many cameras after he was named as Kerry's veep choice that I almost forgot there were actual candidates running.  This being an election year, a lot of the kids that come to camp are wearing stickers, t-shirts, and other paraphenalia endorsing one of the two major presidential candidates.  Looking back, I'm fairly certain that my parents made a choice not to force their political beliefs on me while I was young.  They tried to explain issues and policies to me in a non-partisan manner, and in most situations I didn't even know who they voted for until I was in high school.  The freedom they gave me from their own views on politics alowed me to form my own opinions on issues and candidates.  When I was in 8th grade I signed up for Ross Perot mailings and actually held signs outside of our local polling place--something my parents chuckled at, but also supported me in.  When I see nine year-old kids espousing "facts" about political figures, or rather, regurgitating what usually ends up being the somewhat mangled opinions of their parents, I feel conflicted.  Part of me feels that parents who drag their kids to political rallys and feed them full of "absolute" rights and wrongs in politics are doing these children a disservice.  Everyone knows  that  person, now in college, who walks around with his parents' beliefs spewing from his own lips, with little or none of his own thought added to the mix.  At the same time, I believe that most anything people do together as a family will benefit their children.  Whether it's going apple picking, going to the movies, or cooking dinner together, creating a close-knit family that spends time together helps children.  It can't be wrong to introduce children to politics at an early age, because it involves them in their community, their country, and their family.  It can't be wrong to give kids a sense of belonging to something bigger then they are.  However, I still can't shake the strange feelings that come over me when I hear a child, who isn't old enough to understand why he can't run on a slippery pool floor, explain to me the certainties of who is  good  and who is  bad  in the upcoming election.

      ...it was the summer of '69, or '04 rather.  The point is, that after not playing guitar intensively for about a year, using it to teach and sing with in class for about 3 hours a day is beginning to take a toll on my fingers.  By the end of my last class today I thought I might pass out from the pain in my left hand.  Uh oh, my melodramatic bitching alarm just went off.  I'll stop now.

      The guys that are apparently going to rent our place next year are complete yarfnorts.  They're classic Somerville trash, with their fake tans and their sunglasses that rest atop their heads on even the cloudiest of days.  They're here right now and I just had to hide this window while one of them came in and asked me for the 142nd time, "Hey, buddy, is there anything wrong with this place?  Why ah you leavin'?  It's alright, right, right?"  They keep complaining to me about how hard it's going to be to get their 53" television in here, and I have to forcibly keep my mouth shut so I don't blurt out, "You have a 53" television.  I hate you.  I don't care how you get the motherfucker in here."  Another just came in my room and snooped around while I was pretending to do other things.  "Hey, buddy, you gottalot a books, huh?"  I think I won't mention to them the fact that the house is slowly falling apart, or that the dogs in the neighborhood bark for no reason for several hours a day.  I'm  DEFINITELY  not telling them about my arch-nemesis, the ice cream truck that comes here every day between April and October, playing that same ungodly and incessant "Pop goes the weasel" ringer.  Last summer I got so fed up with it that I actually leaned out my window with a megaphone (the story behind why I would have such equipment in my possession is not for public consumption) and pleaded, "For the love of everything holy, please turn off  that Goddamned song!"  A few months ago I actually opened my windows and blared some Jovi back at them, Noriega-style.  Have fun here, gents.  Or rather, have fun here,  buddies ...

      Hmm.  Terrorist sleeper cells.  Gay couples getting married.  I wonder which is the bigger threat to our society?  Apparently some people just aren't sure:   Senator Rick Santorum compared the thousands of gay couples already legally married in the U.S. to the threat coming from terrorists. "Isn't that the ultimate homeland security, standing up and defending marriage?" he argued. Senator Wayne Allard, the main sponsor of the amendment, continued, "There is a master plan out there from those who want to destroy the institution of marriage."    It sounds like gays are sitting down at their own Wannsee Conferences, hatching their plan for the downfall of Western Civilization.   urlLink Here  for the rest of the Time magazine essay.

      I watched the original version on PBS last night, and I remembered what an amazing film it is.  I'm wary of what this summer's remake is going to do to the classic, though Jonathan Demme is a great director.  I suppose as long as the new one attempts to emulate the original's detailed character development, can bring a modern perspective to the original idea, and doesn't include a blaring DMX soundtrack to thirty-minute motorcycle/hotrod chases, it'll be alright.

       	 		 		 I started getting a wee bit sentimental about leaving Somerville, the town that has served me well for the past five years, for good. Then I went to visit my new digs, and remembered that they're cool, and where I live now is not. For example: I cannot look out my window at this moment and see Old Ironsides and Bunker Hill. I will, however, be able to do that next month. How nice. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Constitution 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink travtufts .

      My sister is in San Fransisco for the summer, and she lent me her car while she's gone. At first, I have to say, I was very excited about the prospect of my own wheels. I hadn't had a car at my disposal since high school and with a number of weddings this summer I thought it would be quite convenient.     It's only July and I already know that I just can't handle having a car in Boston. Between trying to find parking, paying outrageous sums of money for garage parking, and never finding parking, it's just not as convenient as I had hoped. Not to mention the traffic, which at most times is exactly what I imagine Dante's fifth circle of hell to be like: a bunch of angry people sitting with their windows open, honking itermittently for no discernible reason, and punching their steering wheels to the beat of the speed metal blasting from their stereos.     But my biggest issue, the thing that really irks me to the extent that I occasionally join the legions of wheel-punchers out there, is this: when I'm backed up in traffic in a lane that isn't moving, while the lane to my right seems to be going just fine. I, as the person right behind the car that is turning left and causing the blockage, should clearly be the first one to go when the coast is clear, but oh no. Every car behind me thinks that  they  should jump ahead and pull out from behind me, driving bye with smug little smirks on their faces while I bloody my knuckles on my hapless steering column.     Ok.  Good.  It's out now.  I can think about other things.

      I finally saw  urlLink Fahrenheit  last night and I am sad to say that I was, once again, disappointed by Michael Moore. I feel like whenever I see a film of his, whether it's Roger and Me, or Bowling for Columbine, he raises a handful of really spectacular points that deserve discussion. Unfortunately, at the same time he scatters another thirty not-so-spectacular ideas in with the few worthy ones. I wish he had spent more of his times addressing some truly pressing issues, rather than lampooning people in a manner no more intellectual than Jay Leno.     I mean, I don't think anyone in this country actually believes that George W. Bush is a brilliant man. He's a poor speaker, a poor thinker, and he is in serious need of a good thesaurus. Let's just accept that fact and talk about real issues rather than showing funny clips of him looking like a jackass. The comedic overtone to the film really took away from its respectability and its message, and this was only exacerbated by the editing. Why, after tearing up while watching a mother of a soldier KIA in Iraq, would I want to again laugh at some quirky Bush mannerism?     Another solid thirty minutes of the movie that could have been dropped were dedicated to imagining what might be going on in people's minds, specifically the President's, at different periods in the last ten years. We'll never know. Until the Patriot Act crosses the boundaries of private thought, we'll never know. So why would it be important to hear what Michael Moore things someone else is thinking? It's not.     Lastly, I can't help but feel that Michael Moore has finally arrived at the level of Rush Limbaugh and Al Franken. He is partisan to sell a film, not to sell his beliefs. When the aforementioned mother of the KIA soldier visited Washington and literally broke down crying, convulsing on the sidewalk outside of The White House, why in God's name didn't Michael Moore, this champion of the people, this man who cares when no one else does, go to comfort her? Instead he leaves the camera on this grieving woman, simply because it's a more striking image with which to sell the film.     Rush, Al, Michael, Bill O'Reilly, and pretty much everyone else who makes their living off of twisting facts to suit their financial gain should just go on a Fox Network celebrity boxing show and just get it over with. They can all split the profits.     Meanwhile, let's actually spend more than thirty minutes of a "life-changing" film talking about the financial status of our men and women in uniform and our men and women in the classroom, or the ways in which the military specifically targets low-income youth to fight our wars, or even the startling popularity of distinctly partisan, and often erroneous media outlets.

      I've been thinking a lot recently about the period of life I've just completed. Socially, it's just one gigantic transition period. You spend your childhood growing up, friends come and go, but in general you are in the same place or at least same type situation. You go through high school, have the best friends in the world, and then after four years Â–  CHOP    Â– you all scatter to the corners of the earth. You see each other infrequently, your lives grow in different directions, and sooner or later you lose contact with all but the truest of friends.     You go to college. Well, if you and your family can pay for it, you go to college. There you start off fresh, not knowing anyone, but with everyone in a similar situation milling around, friendless, in this academic and social microcosm. Making friends comes rather easily in this environment. Then, after the fastest four years ever,  CHOP  ,  you all scatter to the corners of the earth.     Suddenly you're in a completely new place: the real world. You have a job (or in some places, don't, so you pretend to have a job and make one up that barely pays the bills...), you barely see your college friends, let alone those few solid ones from high school, and for the second time in five years you're left with another blank social slate. Except this time people aren't wandering around campus with glazed looks in their eyes, searching for someone Â– anyone Â– to latch on to. Now you have to work.     You work to meet new people. You work to keep your college friends close. You work to pay your rent, your bills, and your notables DVD Club subscription. Your cell phone's free long distance tries its best to keep you connected to everyone, but soon the long conversations turn to short ones, and then to emails, and then finally to the last thread of communication: the mass-email. No one has much money, so visits are few and far between.     There are no impending chops looming on the horizon. You're settling down and if you move it's a decision you make for your own reasons. You realize that you can form relationships with people that won't necessarily be cut or stretched prematurely, but part of you doesn't feel like you even want new friends. You want your old friends, and you want them with you.     Yeah.  That's a lot to chew on.

      It was one of those mornings where you wake up in your dark room, huddled underneath the covers because of how cold it is, and you hear the sound of trash being collected outside and realize that no one in your house remembered to take the trash out.  Fuck.  Is it seriously July right now?  It's barely 60 degrees outside and it's going to rain all week.  Not that I'm complaining.  Well, I suppose I AM complaining.  But it sure beats those humid, 95 degree days where you can pretty much only bear to sit around watching flies meet their untimely demise on the long coils of fly paper dangling in front of your face.  Time to take the dog out.

      Today was the definition of "blah".  It threatened to rain for most of the  morning, and then made good by the afternoon.  On the bright side, my  usually sweltering classroom was inhabitable without the use of a fan,  so that was quite nice.  Last year one of the third grade girls I teach music to was talking to  me during lunch as she admired the remains of a cannoi she had just  finished shoving into her mouth.  She remarked, "I love cannolis!   Travis, I wish you were just one big cannoli, so I could just suck the  stuff right out of you."  This kind of clueless, inadvertent innuendo continued last week when  the very same girl was standing behind me at the soft serve ice cream  machine.  She noted that wafer cones are better than sugar cones when  it comes to soft serve, and I said "that's because they have a wider  mouth, they can catch more ice cream."  Her reply:  "I have a wide mouth!  You could just use me!"  I still can't get through telling those stories without laughing.  I have her for another five weeks, so we'll see what other ridiculousness comes out the wrong way.

      I'm sitting here eating my Capt. Crunch, waiting for it to get a little soggy so the dry and inherently sharp pieces of cereal don't cut the crap out of my mouth.  I really don't feel like teaching today.  Looking outside at the rain it just makes me want to stay inside and watch movies while alternating between naps and mostly conscious states.

      So I decided to give this a shot and air my dirty laundry in public for a while.  I'm not exactly sure what kind of ideas, brilliant or embarrassing, I'll write here, but my hope is that they will be as unadulterated as possible.  Or perhaps I'll just focus on adulterating the shit out of them.  Only time will tell.  It's official:  I'm moving the hell out of Somerville, Massachusetts into the dreadfully stylish North End of Boston.  That's a lot of capital letters for one sentence, at least for my tastes.  I'm fairly sure that reading Eats Shoots and Leaves has ruined my life.  So I'm abandoning my neighborhood of young hoodlums hanging outside CVS storefronts for a neighborhood of shirtless, seventy year old Italian men hanging outside expensive open-air cafÃ©s.  My amusement at the fact that Mase's new single is a cover of the theme to Welcome Back Kotter--to welcome himself back to the music business, no less--doesn't seem to be nearing an end any time soon.  Oh, and who knew that Olivia from The Cosby Show is now a recording artist?  Not me, that's for sure.

      I really haven't seen a lick of Olympic coverage yet, but this morning I read that the US men's team lost to Puerto Rico yesterday.  Puerto Rico!  I love it! Now I'm sure that the PR team had some good players and I know that I'm going to stereotype horribly, but in my high school, which was made up of a little under 50% Puerto Rican students, I never met one that was over six feet tall.  It's just spectacular. Allan Iverson's face on the cover of our newspaper is classic. I'm unbelievably amused by all of this. Now don't get me wrong, I am rooting for the US in almost every sport, but I love a good Goliath slaying no matter who it is.  Larry Brown told the media, "They played as a team...they played so much harder and so much better than we did that the result isn't a surprise at all." That pretty much summarizes everything I hate about the NBA, and by deduction, the US men's basketball team. They play no defense, they rely on one or two star players with little or no support from their bench, and they only play hard for the last ten minutes of each game.  My problem with players coming straight out of high school to the NBA has little to do with missing a college education, because for the most part a college education for a varsity Division 1A athlete is bullshit. It has to do with the fact that they go from high school, where very few teams play as a unit, to the NBA, where very few teams play as a unit. They completely skip the best, most exciting, most passionate basketball in the world--NCAA basketball.  Anyway, I just can't wait until the US team plays its next game. I hope they lose to a team of eleven-year-old pygmies from Cameroon. Now it's time for Clay and I to go to a spa for a massage. Hah!

      The view from the patio of the Ferrer Vineyard.   We left San Francisco this morning and headed north to Napa Valley and California wine country. After a visit to a winery, which included a lengthy tour that we eventually bailed on, we rolled into our new accommodations.  We're staying in a bungalow-like cottage that sits on a golf course. We're so close that if someone hooked a tee shot a little too much, it would come crashing through the windows. It's one of many similar structures that are all satellites to the one giant "mansion" that lies at the end of a long tree-lined driveway. I feel pretty strange being here, to be honest. The mansion is pretty ritzy, with expensive cars parked all around it and perfectly groomed lawns leading to endless stretches of tennis courts. I really wouldn't be surprised if the theme music from  Beverly Hills, 90210  just started playing out of thin air and the whole gang showed up out of nowhere.  In another brilliant chapter in my unending saga of nerddom, I realized within an hour of being here that they had wireless internet and immediately slapped down the $10 for a day's worth of service.  I haven't seen any of the Olympics, but for some reason I don't seem to care that much about it. I guess I'm just more of a Winter Games kind of guy.  In other news, my brother Clay has pretty much lost it.   Granted, this much time alone with family in such close quarters can drive any person crazy, but just look at his eyes and you can tell that something in him has snapped. He threatened to kill each of us at least five or six times during a single game of hearts tonight. He also chased my sister around the bungalow in an hour-long chase that involved each of them being locked into bedrooms multiple times.  Tomorrow we're visiting more vineyards and then going to  urlLink Safari West . I don't really know what to expect. We're "camping" (in quotes because my mom mentioned something about our tents having hard wood floors) and will apparently be sleeping among an assortment of transplanted animals from all corners of the globe. Strange. I'll hopefully have pictures, unless my brother, inspired by the various wildlife around us, decides to kill us all in our sleep in some strange  Lord of the Flies  scene.

      For our last performance at camp I made a slideshow of pictures of all the kids set to music that we play on the big screen. A number of parents came up to me and asked me to email them some of the pictures, and I did so yesterday before I left.  What I didn't know was that in that list of emails were the emails of three of my students, and since I sent them the pictures yesterday I've already received four responses back. I'm afraid what this might lead to. So far their responses haven't been more than:  HEY TRAVIS!!!!!  :) :) :) :)  I'm pretty sure this is one of the unwritten commandments of teaching--never let students get your email. There was a guy who worked with me last summer who made the mistake of giving out his IM name, and after that he was never the same.

       Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west.   Seriously, though, after a rather grueling flight that seemed to never end we rolled in to SF at about 12amPDT, so 3 for me and my body.  I think I'm getting sick, but I can never tell with the dry, recirculated air on planes.  On the plane there was a guy from Boston that had three children, none of whom was over the age of four. He was wrangling them, carrying them in car seats down the aisle, cleaning up their urp. It was spectacular. I was having a horrible flight, but after watching him go about all of that without freaking out I felt rather sheepish complaining.  In other news, this hotel has wireless internet, and I am a nerd.

       urlLink Ah hah  urlLink .   Tax code is so hard for people to figure out, myself included, but hopefully this bipartisan report from a former Bush economist will shed some light on the subject.  It's not that the richest 1% isn't paying enough.  It's that if anyone  has  to pay more, it logically should be those that can afford it the most.  Job creation is way under par, and perhaps it is because the majority of new jobs are created by middle-class small business owners, not corporate tycoons shipping their operations overseas.

      As I alluded to in my previous post, I will be in California visiting my sister as well as a handful of vineyards until the 18th. I promised myself a month ago that I will write here every day, and I plan to continue that for the most part while I'm away. Who knows, maybe I'll even throw in a picture of me sucking dry a cask of amontillado. I just hope I don't get walled in by some psycho like that poor Fortunato fellow.

      That line, of course, comes straight from spirited mouth of Seaman Beaumont in the John McTiernan film of Tom Clancy's  The Hunt For Red October.   If you knew that already, I love you forever and want to make Connery-quoting babies with you.  But in all seriousness, I  have  done it--despite my last name being one other than Thompson. Less than thirty minutes ago I completed one of the most ridiculous work periods of my life. It was worse than college, when I had a number of lengthy papers due, several finals to study for, and repertoire I had to teach 10 people individually for a concert that was looming near. It was worse than in high school, when I successfully completed the entirety of my AP English coursework in one weekend. (And yes, it  was  the last weekend of the year.  You didn't even think otherwise, did you?)  For the past two weeks I have been bitching, moaning, wailing, whining, and plain old sulking about the work load I took on in such a short period of time. I decided it would be in my best interests, financially at least, to work my regular 8 hour-a-day teaching job while at the same time shooting, editing and distributing video of children's theater.  I have not been a happy camper, especially when dealing with my own actual campers.  I won't get into the unseemly details of this business, because, well,  urlLink I've already done that . I will, however, just say that on average my workday started at 8:30am and ended around 2am. I know I'm a raving pansy compared to some of you that usually work longer than I did each day, but this is  my  space and I just don't care for you and your smug senses of superiority.  But today, my friends, today it all came to a spectacular end. Not only did my kids put on a face-melting show this morning, but just minutes ago I also pumped out the 66th and final DVD that I needed to make. Tomorrow I'll finish up camp with a fun, games-only day, drop off a large box of parental pride (in disc format), and then hop on a 6:30 flight to San Francisco to visit my sister, all the while yelling "come on, Big D, fly!"

      5. I openly discuss how much I hate certain children with my co-workers. 4. Sometimes, in private, I refer to the children I teach as "little bastards." 3. If a child I don't care for is talking to me, and another one that I love comes up, I will pretty much just start listening to the child I like. 2. I've started daring kids to do things I shouldn't dare them to do. a. Example: "Hey, Joe. I dare you to like that greasy spot on the window." Etc. 1. I've begun lying to the children. a. An example:  Yesterday I was having a hard time controlling my class because one kid refused to do what I asked everyone to do. I told him that I would take away some of his swimming time if he didn't listen to me. He responded by telling me that he didn't care if I took away his pool time, and that he hates swimming.  This is when I departed from the shallow waters of sanity and dove, head first, into the deep end of preposterousness. The class around me was still restless because this one child insisted on making a scene in the middle of the room. It was the last class of the day, my classroom was hot and humid, smelled like kid BO, and was about to lose it. In reality, swim time is the only viable penalty available to me, but as you are about to see, I was rapidly departing reality.  "If you hate swimming, then maybe I should make you go into the pool if you don't listen to me."  When the child started telling me that I couldn't make him go swimming, I decided to delve into the specifics of what his In Loco Parentis form allows me to do. Now, anyone over the age of 12 knows that an In Loco Parentis form does in no way give authority to get rid of your own frustration and anger by threatening to force a child to go swimming. Luckily, this kid was only 8. I was able to convince him to sit down and be quiet with the rest of his classmates by lying to him openly.  There you have it. My last day is Friday. I'm really not a bad teacher, but for some reason I think I'm at the end of my rope right now. In fact, my break time is ending in less than five minutes, and I have to go back out there and face the music--literally. (I teach music).

      A big part of me feels like a jackass for posting other people's articles here, both because they are not my original thoughts and because it's kind of a cheap way to go about creating a post. Nonetheless, here is an article that caught my eye today. Pardon me if its theme seems entirely repetitive of those that I have posted here before, but I guess in this election year the endless talk of our American "culture war" is everywhere--even on this lowly site.  The article is from the current issue of Time Magazine and is written by Joe Klein. It discusses the veracity, or lack thereof, of the popular notion that we are a polarized nation in the midst of a "culture war". Are we truly split down the middle, each side dangling its legs off the edges of the political spectrum, or do we just feel like it because the opinions of the select few seem to bombard us from every angle? Oh, and I think I may have let out an audible yelp of joy when I read the Jim Lehrer shout-out. You go, Jim.  urlLink Click Here   It's a nice idea, similar to Barack Obama's keynote speech at the DNC a few weeks ago. We are all Americans, despite our beliefs and political affiliations, and that should--at least in some small way--be a comfort in such an argumentative climate.  At the same time, we clearly have our own opinions. I am most certainly a liberal leaner: I make up my own opinions about issues, "hot button" and not, and it so happens that they often happen to skew towards the left. Growing up in New England I am certainly not alone in my leanings, but sometimes even here there is a sense of shame the accompanies the term 'liberal'. I'm reminded of another recent article I read by Anna Quindlen about the "L" word.   We liberals have fallen on hard times in recent elections...we are not supposed to say our name...But it's worth remembering that today's moderate values were the liberal notions of yesteryear. Social Security. Integrated schools. A war on poverty...We liberals have been shamed into thinking our vision failed, when in fact it has simply been absorbed into the national self-portrait. From the idea that a woman ought to have the same legal rights as her male counterparts to the belief that workers should count on being safe from hazardous conditions, formerly liberal principles have become bedrock democracy.   To be sure, we don't all think alike. We're not quite that Orwellian or Huxleyan (not a word) yet. In many ways I hope I understand the conservative views that normal Americans feel strongly about. I also have no shame in the fact that my conservative brother calls me a "bleeding heart liberal". (He does, thankfully, feel I don't quite warrant his ultimate insult: "tai chi liberal").  Winston Churchill once said "Any man who is under 30, and is not a liberal, has not heart; and any man who is over 30, and is not a conservative, has no brains."  The fact that we don't all think alike is not a weakness, and it most certainly should not be a selling point for radio hot-heads or ego-driven filmmakers  Today on NewsHour Jim Lehrer had five different commentators, all of whom had their own niche along the political spectrum. They sat and talked about their opinions, listened politely to the ideas of others, and managed to remain civil for an entire 30 minute segment.  We as a people should celebrate our beliefs and have discussions, not yelling contests.

      Today on the way to the pool, one of our "not so bright" kids turned to my teaching partner, Nicole, and exclaimed:  "We had a bee hive in my back yard, and it was as big as my dad's fist in my bush."

      It appears Maggie may have peed on her bed last night.  I don't know how the word "caramel" somehow found its way into the "tomato/tomahto" family. It's spelled caramel and it's pronounced "kar-Â•e-Â•mel". This whole pronouncing it "kar-Â•mel" is bullshit. This isn't like "tomato", which has a vowel that one can pronounce either soft or hard. People are actually dropping a syllable from the word and thinking it's okay! No longer, my friends. The revolution begins here.  The movie  Billy Madison  is playing on tv right now, and I just realized that I've been sitting here meticulously picking out the grammatical errors in it. What the hell is wrong with me?  I think Bob Vila just looks like a pudgier Steven Spielberg.    These cows are made out of butter, and if you look closely enough you can see butter statues of Lewis and Clark on the other side of the butter campfire. That's more of an observation than a thought, I suppose.  I'm clearing up my room, trying desperately to get my stuff together for my ongoing move, and I found a whole stash of Canadian  twonies  in my desk. I have no idea when I'll go to Canada in the future, but these add up to $26CAD, so I can't just throw them away. At the same time, it's too small an amount of money to go get exchanged. These kind of things drive me crazy.

      I think I may have inadvertently begun a feud of Hatfield/McCoy proportions with our neighbors this week.  Nish and I, essentially having two apartments in the month of August, are moving in night by night to our new place in the North End. The idea behind this came about because the 36 hour move-athons I've been part of in the last three years were pretty much in the top five of the worst days of my life. We figured that if we just do a little bit each night, late so the roads aren't busy, we can do it without too much pain.  The other night I was trying to find a place to put my car in front of our house so we could load it up. There were no spots on the street, so I decided I should quickly park in the driveway next to us. We're pretty sure the house to our right is some sort of parent-less, juvenile halfway house or some shit like that. Our neighbors have been complete assholes about us "borrowing their concrete" for a few minutes to do stuff, but I figured it was worth a shot.  When I got back down to my car, about five minutes later, there was a car on the street blocking me in the driveway. I figured it belonged to someone across the street, so I honked my horn twice in a span of ten minutes. Finally, out of the house next to us, came this disgruntled kid and his girlfriend, screaming about this and that.  "You pahk in  my  fuckin' driveway!?  And then you honk  your  horn?!" "I'm really sorry," I replied.  "I didn't know this was your car." "Of course it's  my  cah.  It's  my  fuckin' driveway!"  The above exchange repeated itself a few times until I gave up on apologizing, and jumped in my car.  Tonight, not wanting to piss off the dickheads next door by using their driveway, I double parked on the street in front of my house for five minutes. This is a terrible pain, because each time a car comes down the street I have to take my car around the block and back so they can get through. I did this twice in about five minutes, but somehow as I ran back upstairs to grab the keys to the new apartment I hear someone laying on their horn outside.  Sure enough as I run outside, it's the jackass and his skanky girlfriend, flashing their brights and honking loud enough to annoy everyone on the entire street. I didn't have it in my heart to try to remedy the situation, so I just shot the guy a pissy look and drove off.  I really wish I had done something worse, but then again I've been working with kids for nine hours a day over the past five weeks, so my expletive vocabulary is seriously out of shape. If I could have had that moment back, I definitely would have used my favorite curse word. Yes. The C Bomb.  Maybe next time.

      In a bold and possibly fruitless move, I've decided to take my work to... well, work. So now I'm teaching music, and with any few minutes of down time, I'm creating menus and links for DVDs. I just have to keep the grubby kids away from the computer.  I'm in the calm of the storm right now. I kind of freaked out the other day and felt like I couldn't handle all the stuff that needs to get done by next Friday. Right now I'm feeling alright, but it's not an alright that comes with being satisfied with how much work I've actually accomplished, it's more a calm that comes because I have no other choice but to be calm for a few days or totally lose it.  Ok, kids are screaming, that usually means I need to go see what's going on.

      One of my very favorite parts of listening to NPR is the occasional audio essay by broadcasting great Walter Cronkite. They are few and far between, but he chooses his topics and timing well, and the finished product always gives me a sense of longing for his brand of journalistic integrity.  It is odd that I feel a wave of sentimentality for an era of reporting that ended the very year I was born, but Cronkite speaks with such authority and candor that he makes the news anchors of today seem like either brainless puppets or whiney, loudmouth idiots. Perhaps I see him in the often flattering light of old age, a time in which even the most controversial figures can be looked upon by a majority of people in a reverential and admiring manner. Regardless, his commentary on this, the 40th anniversary of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, was riveting. Listen here:  urlLink Part 1    and  urlLink Part 2.   There is no doubt that the essay is pointedly topical considering both today's political climate, as well as last week's terror alert, but Cronkite somehow delivers the message with a sage-like authority that I believe transcends political persuasions. In the LBJ/McNamara phone conversations that make up the basis for the commentary, you can hear the vague and incorrect intelligence reports, the politicization of war, the tactics of fear, and the terribly familiar underestimation of enemy will and tenacity.  If only Walter Cronkite was the media voice of our time now, rather than Bill O'Reilly and Michael Moore. Perhaps it would not change popular opinion in this era of extreme partisanship, but it would certainly bring back at least a fraction of dignity to the broadcast media.

      Reaction here still spans the spectrum of emotion. On one hand you have Dan Shaughnessy, whom I hate, but who sheds some light on the privacy of the clubhouse in his  urlLink Globe article .  On the other hand you have these crying kids that worshiped Nomar in  urlLink this article .  I still stand by my original reaction, but it's going to be a while for all this to die down.

       NOMAR IS GONE.    I actually didn't find out for a while. I was in Providence with Jocelyn, out of communication and ignoring all print, radio and television media outlets, when my phone showed two new voicemails. One was from BJ, telling me that Nomar had been traded. His voice had a strange tone to it, like he was half happy and half sad. Maybe he was just in shock. The next message, however, had a distinctly different tone. It was from my sister, Phoebe, who is a lifelong, diehard Nomar fan. Her room in New Haven is one enormous collage of Nomar magazine covers, Boston Globe pictures, articles, interviews, and other paraphernalia. She has been known to refer to herself as Phoebe Garciaparra at times. Needless to say, her message was an almost indecipherable series of sobs and attempted sentences interrupted by more sobs.  When I found out, I was, for the most part, glad. Nomar has never been what I would consider a real Red Sox player. He was a professional who put on the uniform, worked hard and wanted to win, but he never had the spirit that defines the fan favorites. He, like Ted Williams in his day, had trouble talking to the media and trouble talking to the fans. He played hard on the field, but when the game was over you got the sense, especially later in his career with the organization, that he just didn't care that much.  After a series of injuries in the past few years, it's become apparent that he is never going to be the same player he was when he was winning batting titles and hitting home runs like a champ. Perhaps it's because of these nagging injuries, perhaps it's because of Mia Hamm, but he just isn't the same. His previous aloofness has turned into an apparent disregard for the team and the game. Read Sportsguy's article here for more on this.  I was not sad when I heard the news of Nomar going to the Cubs. I do have to admit, however, that after I heard Phoebe's lachrymose message I felt a tinge of regret. Not for the Nomar of today, but for the Nomar of the late 1990s. When the ball was hit into the hole and he barely gloved it, but somehow turned around mid-air and threw a rocket to first base to get the runner, it was spectacular. When he was hitting well and could seemingly drop a hit anywhere on the field or off the wall, usually on the first pitch, it was beautiful. And when he still had discernible affection for the Boston fans, saluting them and throwing balls and bats into the crowd on the last day of the season, it was memorable.  Who knows what will happen now. Perhaps he'll waste away in the National League, lasting another few years in mediocrity. Or perhaps he'll be part of that long and unending horror story that is Red Sox history and enjoy a renaissance, having the best years of his career somewhere else only to return and beat the Sox when it really counts.  I'll miss the old Nomar, but I'm pretty sure I won't have another thought about sulky, distant, apathetic Nomar. Happy trails, sir.
