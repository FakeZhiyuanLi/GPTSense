						       Please do not get me wrong fellow inmates, I love my adopted city. Seattle.....The Emerald City. Rain City. I was however raised in the greater Los Angeles area where they take driving seriously. In LA we invented the freeway shooting. Screw up behind the wheel and the slugs will fly.      Here in great Northwest, it's shocking. These folk grew up driving in rain and snow and on ice. Yet the worst drivers are here. It's a series of roads inhabited by lemmings. When one brakes, they all break.      Anyway, fellow cosmonauts, before I go on on should tell you three plus years ago I took up residency in an insane asylum. I live with insane people. I used to consider myself only slightly abnormal yet now realize the full depth of my damage. I must be the most insane person there because I have been residing there by choice!      Back to bad drivers. Here are questions and statements I have felt both compelled and obligated to say in the last 48 hours to those behind the wheel:   "Please do the planet a favor and do not reproduce"   " Sir, did you purchase your license off eBay?" Follow up to his profane reply: "Why are you wearing a bandana, are you a pirate?"    "Sir, your turn indicator is not functioning" Follow up to "Yes it is"    "oh, must be your brain that is not functioning"  No reader, I have nothing better to do with my time. The perfect job for me would be driving around and revoking on the spot the driving rights of the moronic.      And people wonder why all my friends are a**h*les!

						        Another day in the paradise known as the great Pacific Northwest. More coffee consumption and less sunshine than any point in the known universe. More comfirmed cases of clinical depression here than any there.  Is it any wonder that my minds on fire, imprisoned by the thought of what to. Preparation for my move from the Puyallup Gulag to Wallingford on track. Ahh, back to the land of Piecora's, Pagliacchi, Ivars and Dick's. Yes to the first three, nay to the latter.       Parenting the small T-Rex is a trip. 2.5 years old and in charge. Smacked a wall today in anger. Whoa.        The ambassador from Vulcan arrives soon. I wait.        There is no such thing as a final destination. If you haven't arrived, you're not there yet.        All said, living in Seattle IS all it's cracked up to be. I would add one more Angelino if I had my druthers.        I feel better.....thanks for letting me rant. RGS

						        Hi fellow malcontents...........If you happen across this post a comment. Sometimes when I get bored, I (being single) cruise the singles chat line (the free one-being frugal, as in cheap) for laughs. The quote above was an actual intro blurb from a caller. That in itself gives you an insight into the splendid summer we are enjoying here in Seattle.                            Matter of fact, it was 95 here today in Seattle. That shatters the previous July 24th reord of 91. The great thing about Seattle .......okay so I wrote that a week ago. It's still premium here. Another week of a fantastic summer with excellent air quality.                       So I started doing this because I thought it was cool. I confused cool with trend. This is just a trend. And I'm not a trendy person. It's way too much work and you just end up giving away a lot of out of trend clothing and music recordings. This is just another way to pontificate and/or deficate publically.                      This pretty much blows. I temper that comment with the knowledge my blof fog creativity blows even more. Waaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

						   So  I had really decided not to be common and use this to post political opinion. However when Geore W recommends that a new position of  "Intelligence Czar" be created and that said czar be picked by the president I must ask: WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS SELECTION PROCESS?!
