       okay w.e. it didnt happen and will never happen.. i didnt get any chance ... thank god i didnt know him ... atleast my feelings werent crushed.. it basically sucks tho... but it happens .. im still kinda hopeing i get a chance some how .. but he likes someone i guess.. whatever ill just laugh it off like i usually do.. dont mean it doesnt hurt inside.. but owell i cant force someone to give me a try.. maybe they are the ones missing out but somehow i know im missing out on alot its just something that i felt ... cant change that because it kept me up till 4 in the morning thinking about how nice it would feel to be complete n excepted for once.... o trust me i dont blame the kidd he dont know me n shouldnt have to give me a try if he dont wanna ive done that before too ... w.e.. i just dont even know what to say or how to deal... i knew not to get my hopes up n i still sorta did but im glad i kept that doubt in my head because i dont feel as badd... haha i dont even know why i feel this way i dont even know the poor kidd.. but i aint guna be like some ppl n just keep pushing the fact... if my friends do something about it thats them n i wont really care.. but that wont happen ( it would be nice) but it aint necessary .. but ill just leave it alone i should have sed something to him the day i met him .. because that was my one n only opportunity n it will prolly never happen again =(... dont worry im not ... wait i just dont kno how im supposed to feel ... iight layter guys&nbsp; more happend in my day but i just wanted to get that out in the open... you wanna talk to me about it im hea n i really wont care.. for once im the one with the problems lol     &nbsp;

      today was an painfully long day... i played three games of softball for the states tourney n we won 1 of the games but we are still in it all we have to do is win the next 5 games tomorrow n we are states champs ya its unlikely but we are the underdog team.. n i know we can pull through...i didnt play as well as usual today but the excuse i wanna use isnt really exceptable its just the fact that i aint used to it yet lol ... my dad tried to call me yesterday which was really shocking.. n then i tried to call him back but of course he never answers the phone when i call.. its like he dont really wanna talk to me if he dont have to.. im supposed to spend two weeks of every summer down with my dad but thats not happening plus his whole new family thinks that i only come down on holidays n birthdays soo i can get stuff but that aint true its just that thats the only time of the year my dad will pick me up n he barely does that..enuff with my dad... i talk to danny today i guess we are making plans to chill sometime soon..me him n tyren used to be madd close of friends but since we are at diff schools we havent had the time to hang out or anything anymore.. they are a few of my bestfriends .. even tho ive always liked one of them or the other at one point in time lol .. idk how they even felt but thats kool.. n i think thats part of the reason why we are such good friends... i dont care i can handle guy  friends much better than girlfriends just because of the fact that i usually cant stand girls well atleast the stuck up mean annoying ones.. but i make friends with just about anyone.. like the girls on the other softball teams n the umpires.. idk i get bored n feel like saying hii but its funny lol... well once again i have to wake up at 4 in the morning soo ill write agauin sometime soon layter lovees =)
