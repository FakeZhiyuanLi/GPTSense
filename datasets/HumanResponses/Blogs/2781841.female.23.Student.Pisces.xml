						   I had a dream last night about a friend of mine from high school whom I haven't seen in at least a year and a half.  It was one of those weird dreams that involve lots of people that you know but who don't know each other in real life, though they do in the dream, and it had one of those houses that suddenly become different houses depending on how you walk through it... Dreams are so weird sometimes, nothing is constant in them, especially buildings.  Anyways, I haven't seen this friend in quite a while and have completely lost touch with him, but apparantly my brain decided to think of him last night.  It was one of those dreams that are strongly emotional (what!! emotional?? but heather ann, that's so unnatural for intjs like you!! -- i know, but i was DREAMING... the strangest things can exist in dreams, even emotional intjs!) and they stay with you for a while.  I think I miss that friend.  I would like to know what he's up to lately.  There are far too few entertaining boys in my life right now.  So, Sanda, what I'm trying to say is that while people from your past are haunting you in waking life, the people from my past are haunting me in dreaming life, and I'm not sure what I would prefer.  Probably dreaming life, actually.  It's random but nice sometimes and I can ditch it when I wake up.  Do you think it's bad to never want to see people again?  More than that, do you think it's bad to make an effort not to see someone again?

						   Sometimes life is too random for comfort. I think everyone from my past should stop haunting me and if you are deciding that you are going to start, well don't. There is a reason I left you in my past. So other than the complete randomness of unexpected people I have been running into and talking to over the last couple weeks, everything is going swell and I think it's high time we enjoy some of that fine powder out there! Yay for my up coming snowboarding adventure!!!!

						   I went to school with  urlLink him .  Haha.  We weren't friends, I was very Christian and he listened to "satanic" music and smoked pot all the time.  Those profiles just get funnier as the years go by.  :)

						    urlLink This  is a great interview at  urlLink The Morning News  with Brian Greene, author of  urlLink The Elegant Universe  which has been on my To Read list for quite some time.  This blew my mind:  ‘The simplest assumption is that the universe will become ever darker, and ever emptier, as the galaxies recede from us and in the very far future, there will be nothing in evidence. Everything will have disappeared beyond the horizon.’   I found this part especially interesting, as it's a new way to look at things:    BG:  [My mom] is very concrete, [laughs] which is great. To me, I just gravitate toward – and I think many people do – let’s look at popular culture again. The Matrix, a very successful movie. Why? Well, it was a great movie (Matrix one, I am referring to) but at its heart it had the notion that what you see is not really what there is. That touches people, because everybody or many people are searching for a deeper reality and anything that kind of brushes up against a deeper reality.   RB:  I find that impulse a little frightening – its outcome is frequently religious dogma.   BG:  It can be for some people but for many people it’s not. Ultimately the deeper levels of reality that are subject to experimental testing, those are the ones that grab me. That’s not the right measure for the religious sensibility. My brother is a Hare Krishna and his deeper reality differs from mine. He finds it very fulfilling, what he does. It’s not his full-time occupation, but it is the grander picture for him. Now, that’s not an experimentally testable framework, I don’t think. And I don’t think that’s the right measure. For him, it’s a more spiritual measure. For me it’s, ‘Does it work? Can you test it in the lab? Can you test it through astronomical observations?’ I don’t think one is better than the other. Certainly one grabs me more than the other. But that’s a personal choice.

						    urlLink Meredi  thinks that I may have an ulcer, she says my symptoms sound the same as what she had when she had one.  So, maybe that's it.  Silly as this is, I never thought of it as being an actual physical problem, I just figured I got crazy when I got stressed out.  Of course, stress could certainly trigger an ulcer, and if I had one a year ago and now I've somehow kick-started it again, well, I should get that fixed.  So, I'm going to the walk-in clinic tomorrow.  Big day today!  Today we find out just how nice boys can be, let's see how long it takes to dispell my bitterness.  :)  Can I just say, it is   beautiful   in Toronto this weekend.  It is between 7 and 10 degrees POSITIVE and it is spring-y and I got splashed with MUD by a car yesterday and it was irritating but it was okay because this means that spring is coming!  I went downtown to hang out with Mere yesterday and I didn't even wear a coat, it was great.  Oh, and bonus: Mere finally came over to my house (yay!) and we watched High Fidelity and my roommate KP baked buns AND chocolate chip cookies.  KP's buns are the BEST buns ever and she makes so many at one time and she has a rule that you have to eat at least one from every batch, which is a rule that I am particularly fond of in our house.  Plus melt-in-your-mouth chocolate chip cookies!  She is, perhaps, the best roommate ever.  Have I mentioned that she brings me tea unbidden?  She does.  Have I mentioned that she loves the concept of birthday week and started participating in the celebrations EARLY?  Or that she has the cutest dry sense of humour ever?  Or that she does elaborate cross-stitching and has really old funky tea cups (with LEGS!) from her great great aunt or something AND that she's a wicked floor hockey goalie?  Or that she lights up and gets so excited when she talks about Russian literature?  Or that she is secretly the best masseuse I have ever had the undying pleasure of living with, possibly even meeting?  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have an excellent roommate.

						   Okay, waking up at 7:30 is better than waking up at 4:30, but it still sucks when it is on a Saturday and I don't have to do anything until 2:00.  Maybe this means that I'll actually get my butt in gear and do some studying.  I keep waking up because my stomach is upset and my room is stuffy.  So, I open my window, which means I have fresh air but after a few minutes my room is freezing.  Then I'm huddling in my bed, cold and with an angry tummy.  So, I get down off of my bed (it is a  urlLink loft bed, , this makes getting out of bed more of an event) to the ground where it is much much colder because cold air falls down to the bottom of my room.  Knowing that my floor is going to be a few degrees colder is not much of an inspiration for getting up (down?) in the morning.  Anyways, so I get up and then I am wide awake (like now, writing this at 8:15 on a Saturday) and kind of cold and bored.  And breakfast seems like a lot of effort and no one is online to entertain me, but the cat is really friendly because he's been by himself all night and he wants some lovin'.  So, the question is, why is my stomach upset?  Well, boys and girls, let me tell you a little story about how Heather Ann deals with stress.  Once upon a time, there was a girl named Heather Ann and sometimes she would get a wee bit stressed out, whether that was because she was in a bible college that she hated with a surprising amount of passion, or because she liked a boy who liked her back and was somewhat unsure how to deal with such an unprecedented turn of events.  So, instead of dealing with her stress by getting angry or grumpy or by spending obscene amounts of money on shoes or by going out drinking and 'forgetting' her 'problems', instead her tummy decided to take over.  So, when something was making Heather Ann nervous or crazy, then her tummy would get nervous AND crazy.  For months and months.  In fact, once Heather Ann went to a school named  urlLink Tyndale  and really didn't feel like she fit in (because she didn't, but that's another story), and she felt like vomiting every day for a full semester.  She never did actually vomit, and not for lack of trying (sidenote: Heather Ann would be the World's Least Successful Bulemic Girl Ever), but she woke up every morning with a very fiesty stomach.  So, that's how her tummy tried to help her out, and quite frankly, she wasn't very grateful despite the massive amount of effort that surely went into such attempts to lessen her frustration and/or nervousness and/or excitement.  (Moral of the story: angry tummy = bad!)  So, to bring this back to present-day, my tummy is très faché, and this is not helping things.  Should I write a letter to my tummy and ask it to stop trying to help, really just butt out?  Should I have a little talk with my tummy about how my brain is already obsessive about things that make me nervous, so I'm not sleeping very well anyways because I am dreaming so much about Things That Will Be Left Largely Unsaid, so waking me up at 7:30 and being angry is not really helpful to my cause?  Maybe I should feed euro-chocolate to my tummy and it will realise that really, on the whole, my life is spectacular and it relax now?  Perhaps if I send it an e-card that says "Tummy, I love you and I really appreciate the effort, but the effects of your efforts are not helping, maybe you could try calming the fuck down??" that would convince it?

						   i don't know why i thought about this today but it was one of my favourite books as a child. it's called  urlLink the Giving Tree . I like Shel Silverstein a lot. So when you go and check it out click on all his different books, they are neat. Ahhh how I long for the days of kindergarten again.

						   I would just like everyone to know that today I am wearing my pink and brown stripped socks and my pink & brown blouse. It makes me happy. This is a good thing, because today is going to be a  LONG  day. But my paper is done, this also makes me happy. It makes me happy for several reasons 1) it means that i do not lose 5%, b) i can go snowboarding on sat guilt free, c) i am done before gavin. Now, if only i can get a better mark then him, then truly all will be wonderous.  Emails make me happy as well and so do comments on the blog. So I would strongly suggest and urge you to do both today, because it would MAKE     my day even happier.  Have a good day!!!  PS: It would make my day happy because I am a little grumpy because I stayed up late and got very little sleep to accomplish the easy which was somewhat difficult to write. Well perhaps only because I did it in one sitting. That was a mistake.

						   Who woke up at 4:30 this morning and couldn't get back to sleep until 6:30, and then only on the condition that she had frustrating and somewhat disturbing dreams, and that she had to get up at 7:30?  Oh, could it be me?  Stupiddumbugly sleeping patterns, and now my stomach is all upset and I wish I dealt with stress  any  other way.  Dreams included: - eating candy, only to find that once it got into my mouth, it wasn't candy anymore, once it was a blue bobby pin.  gross. - other things that i can't quite remember, but they involved a certain not-to-be-discussed-in-much-detail-on-this-blog boy, which is ridiculous to the extreme

						   Ever since I moved to St. Catharines my life has been come a daily shendig of random events, almost to the point that it could arguably be called normal.   So yesterday I came home early becasue my sociology seminar was cancelled AND my friend Luke gave me a ride home. So that meant a) I got to come home! and b) I was home by 4:20pm. Wednesdays I normally stay at school until my small group meets at 7pm, because there is no point going ALL the way home only to turn around to go back. So I stay and "work" at school. Anyhow, so I got to come home and have dinner. My roommate also came home early from work, which hardly happens.  We were in the midst of discussing what groceries we had to go and pick up. We were lamenting that we will actually have to go and get toliet paper and bring it back on the bus. We have so far, all year managed to avoid taking the bus to pick up cat litter and toliet paper. While we were talking I was making my dinner of a tortilla, mmmm. I was only about 3 bites into it when there was the loud banging behind me on my window. "Strange" I thought to myself, "tis only 4:50pm who is here!?" And I turned around to see my father knocking on my window.  So I go and let him in and he was a little rushed, but sort of normal for my dad. He comes in and was like "Hey want to go out for dinner!?" I look at my already bitten into tortilla and was like " I sure do!!!" So I put it away for lunch today! But I told my dad that I had to be home for 6pm, because that's when Luke was coming back to get me for small group. That was fine. So we went to No Frills and he bought me groceries, including toliet paper, gave me some cash and then we went for dinner at Wendy's. He also bought dinner for Amanda. Then he we came back at about 5:50pm and he went to go and visit our friend Laura from our church who broke her leg and is in the hospital. I actually had a good time with my father. It was fun, but very random and weird. But that is my life. Just to note, my family lives in Hamilton which is about 45min west of where I live. So it is rare to have them unexpectedly come and visit. But my dad's church (yeah that's right..I'm a PK) is half way between Hamilton & St. Kitts, so people from his congregation sometimes end up in the hospital in St. Kitts and not Hamilton.  In other news... We can now take showers in the light again. Saturday night I tried to change the light bulb in our bathroom but I didn't realize that the glass part of the bulb was not attached to the metal part that goes in the socket. So when I turned on the light, I ummm...some how destroyed the light. Green sparks flew everywhere and we had no more light. The fan worked...but not the light. Anways, after the checking the fuses...which none were burnt, we had to get a electrcian to come in and fix it. And fixed it he did!  Also...if you know anyone who needs a place for the summer...I am looking for someone to come and sublet my apartment as Amanda is moving home for the summer. I don't know something about saving money to go to school if the fall or something crazy like that!? St. Catharines is a beautiful town all year round but especially in the summer. And we are close to Port Dalhousie, so lots of summer fun just waiting to be discovered and explored!!!!!

						   I would just like to state for the record that this "getting up in the morning" business is a crock of shit.  It's even worse when they throw midterms into the mix.  Argh.  Why don't my teachers understand that this is my  birthday week  and I should be allowed to live in blissful ignorance of such horrid things as 7AM?

						   That's right boys and girls, tomorrow is the start of the holiest season of the whole damn year: my birthday week!  My birthday is on March 4th, which is a week from tomorrow, which makes tomorrow the start of Birthday Week!  Any day that is within a week of my birthday counts as part of Birthday week, which means it will start tomorrow and end on March 11th.  It might be the best scam I have ever thought of in my 23 years of gracing the human race with my presence.  Basically, it just means that "but it's my birthday week!" is a valid excuse for anything I feel like doing in the next 15 days.  Oh, and I should be greeted with unbidden tea and chocolate at all possible moments.  :)

						   i would just like to say that my bangs are now long enough to tuck behind my ears as well as put up in a pony tail. I am not to sure what I think about this. I like it when my hair is down, but when my hair is up I feel that my forehead protrudes like that of a  urlLink klingon .   I think it is funny that coming back to school and work this week a lot of people have noticed that apparently i got some sun while I was away. A few people have mentioned to me that, "you got some sunshine on your reading week, didn't you!?"  or "you've gotten some colour?!" I think this is funny (as true as it is that I did get a lot of sunshine) because I spent my reading week in Thunder Bay. It's even funnier because my roommate went to California and I probably came back with more of a tan then she did. I love it!

						   tomorrow i have a presentation for my law and politics class. friday I have a paper for my ideologies class. i handed my lab in....well under the grace of my lab leader, i handed in stuff so i wouldn't get a zero, but not much more of that. i was willing to take a zero since overall each lab is worth 3% and i have to do 10 and overall I have not been doing too badly. Anyways once the presentation is over i will feel better.   Tomorrow i am going with my small group to see the Passion of the Christ. Then I am going with my youth group on Friday..the last time I did that with a movie it was Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. I will have a lot more to say about the movie later....when I am procrastinating from writing about the rise of illiberal democracy. i'm just writing stuff now while i wait for my handout to print. enjoy. i should have read about peacekeeping for seminar tomorrow, but i posted instead. you should be proud hannie.

						   So, I went home this past weekend for my Dad's birthday, and I realised that there are more people living in my apartment building here in Toronto than in my  entire village  back home.  What the heck!  I also realised that I get grumpy when the bus takes six hours to drive somewhere that anyone else could drive in a little over three hours.  Buses suck, I might start taking the train.  Also, this is a thing of beauty:    Let us all meditate on the scenic sauciness of the young Johnny Depp.  And then let's complain to random people for the rest of the day, "But why is the RUM gone??" in honour of his piratey goodness.  News items: 1. I let my sister, Melissa, cut my hair.  I am a brave woman.  And, startlingly saucy with short hair.  Yay! 2. I have a date on Friday.  Or Saturday.  This weekend sometime.  We'll see. 3. It is my birthday on March 4th.  Soon I will be 23, and I can't decide if that is incredibly old or incredibly young.  Most of the people I go to school with are around 18, so I feel old, and most of my friends/roommates are in their late 20s, so I feel young.  Meh. 4. BOTH of my sisters have boyfriends.  Don't ever let someone tell you that life is fair. 5. My dad's birthday was this past Saturday (the 21st), he is now 54.  You should  urlLink email him  and congratulate him. 6. I have a new roommate, Karen.  The jury is still out on her, but she's an excellent photographer, cheerful (if loud), and likes to play Scrabble.  These are all good things. 7. I don't sleep well when I'm at my parents' house.  Maybe the bed sucks?  Maybe I am not used to the house anymore?  Maybe sleeping with someone else (sister) is weird? 8. I read Charles Templeton's book  urlLink Farewell to God  in 2 days.  Not the arguments I would have chosen, but an interesting read nonetheless.  (Templeton was Billy Graham's partner [in ministry, sickos] when he started out and decided that Christianity was wrong after about 10 years of preaching.  Probably would have been just as big as B.G. if he had stuck with it.) 9. Chocolate is good.  European chocolate has the potential to be  very  good. 10. Hi!  There is an item #10 because I like symmetry.  10 is a nice number.  I approve of it.

						   I was indeed suppose to post yesterday when I got back to my apartment. I thought I would be able to since my roommate was not due in until around midnight. But lo and behold when I arrived there was a note saying that she had gone to bed and so I could not get at a computer with internet access. We have been reformatting and so our computers haven't been networked. So we have been down to one computer!  Anyways my week in Thunder Bay was a lot of fun. It was really cool to see my sister and just hang out. So other than just lounging around. We wandered the Tbay Tdot, walking around some paths and such. Hit "the" mall, called the InterCity mall - what kind of name is that!? And just had a lot of fun!  I would have to say that my highlight was going snowboaring with my sister at  urlLink Loch Lomond.  We had a hoot! We are both learning, actually Emily is pretty good, it was only her second time and she could almost keep up with me! We would fall off the ski lift EVERY time! We only landed properly maybe a total of 2 times. We would announce to the people behind us that we were going to fall and that they should be prepared! It was really funny! But I suppose that you would just have to be there!  My sister took me to this bar called Apollos. It was actually a lot of fun. There was foozball and live music and honey garlic wings so I was very happy! We had a good time! We wanted to walk home from the bar because Emily wanted to show me a park that has the coolest overview of the city. It was pretty neat to stand and look over all of Thunder Bay. It is a really neat city and has some really spectacular views! Anyways after we left Hillcrest we were walking down the street and we both had to go to the bathroom really, really badly. Up ahead we see a Max Milk Convience store and so we were just about to head in, when we saw the LU shuttle bus heading back from the bar! Inside were two of Emily's friends so they stopped the bus for us and we got in and made back to LU in time to use the bathroom! So that was pretty exciting! Yay for good timing!!!!  While I was up there I got to check my email once and while I was doing so I got to watch a  urlLink chamleon  eat her dinner. My sister's next door neighbour's in res have one. I think that chamleon's are really neat  urlLink creatures.   Anyways, that's about all I got. I am going to spend the rest of my reading week actually doing some school work, plus having a little more fun....but more to come of that later!

Oh baby cow, how will I ever trust you again?  (Hint: such things can be remedied with candy/amusing letters.)

						   I love this song so much it hurts.  Also in rotation lately: Imagine by John Lennon, A Minor Incident by Badly Drawn Boy, Awake Soon by Sarah Slean, Perfect Day by Lou Reed, Who Loves the Sun by Velvet Underground, She's The One by the Beta Band.    Bowl of Oranges, by Bright Eyes   The rain it started tappin' On the window near my bed There was a loophole in my dreamin' So I got out of it And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open Just my nightstand and my dresser Where those nightmares had just been  So I dressed myself and left then Out into the gray streets But everything seemed different And completely new to me The sky the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body And each person I encountered I couldn't wait to meet  And I came upon a doctor Who appeared in quite poor health I said there's nothing that I can do for you you can't do for yourself He said oh yes you can, just hold my hand, I think that that would help So I sat with him awhile Then I asked him how he felt  He said I think I'm cured No, in fact, I'm sure of it Thank you, stranger For your therapeutic smile  So that's how I learned the lesson That everyone's alone And your eyes must do some raining If you're ever gonna grow And when crying don't help You can't compose yourself It's best to compose a poem An honest verse of longing Or a simple song of hope  That's why I'm singing baby don't worry 'Cause now I got your back And every time you feel like crying I'm gonna try and make you laugh And if I can't If it just hurts too bad Then we'll wait for it to pass And I will keep you company for those days so long and black  And we'll keep working on the problem We know we'll never solve Of love's uneven remainders Our lives are fractions of a whole But if the world could remain within a frame Like a painting on a wall Then I think we'd see the beauty then We'd stand staring in awe  At our still lives posed Like a bowl of oranges Like a story told By the fault-lines and the soil

						   Sanda's in T-bay this week and I am on my reading week, which is consisting of mostly just sleeping so far.  However, I am going to WORK this week, I really intend to.  :)  I'm also going home this weekend, which is great because it's my Dad's birthday and I haven't seen my family since xmas.  I miss them a lot.  Plus, I get early birthday presents because I probably won't see them again before that holiest of days (March 4th).

						   Yesterday I had my snowboarding adventure and an adventure it was! Our plans were to leave by 10am so that we could get there by 12 and snowboard the day away! Well we didn't end up leaving until around 12 and so we therefor didn't get there until 2pm. But we stayed until they closed and we had a really good time! I taught my friend Sharon how to snowboard and she picked it up pretty quickly. Though she didn't have enough confidence in herself to just do. If you are ever going to learn how to snowboard, you need to believe in yourself and don't let the hill beat you. I think it is fairly simply to learn. But confidence is key!!!  Anyways, it was an adventure because around 8:30pm, when we got up the hill and I sat down to do my binding up, I realized that it had fallen off! So my friend Fabian went and found it because I knew it had fallen off when we had arrived to the top of the hill. That was a blessing that it had fallen off there and not while we were on the lift! But the thing was that my screw had fallen off! So in order to get my binding fixed, I had to go down a black diamond with my binding criscrossed! By the way it was my top binding that goes around the ankle, if it was the toe one, I wouldn't have really cared. My other friend Josh helped me to get it criscrossed and actually thought if the idea! Eventually I make it to the bottom and we attempt to fix it and we realize that it cannot be fixed truly and the shops that help with that sort of thing were closed. So that meant for the next 3 runs I did, I had to criscross my bindings to get down! But I actually found that it worked pretty well. At first I was afraid that my foot was going to go flying out, but it didn't. Anyways, it was really a good time and I am killer sore today! But, not as sore as normal, just where I really did hurt myself. Like smacking my tailbone, and twisting my right arm.  Anyways, it was just a great night in general. When we got in the car my mixed tape that my friend Jolene was playing and there is a song on it called "Tonight" and it is by Ace Trouble Shooter. It is the only song I know by them but it is a great song and it really was a good song to end my snowboarding adventure to.   TONIGHT by Ace Trouble Shooter   starry starry night the silver beams the only light summer breeze, summer dreams float over me the stars frame her sillouhette beauty steals away my breath this moment will last forever, forever forever  there is no time but now there's no where else but here...  time has lost it's grip tonight beautiful, enchanted, i just might hold her, hold her close never let her go the tenderness in her eyes her hair is drenched with silver moonlight half-spoken thoughts, forget-me-nots she's the jewel i've sought she's the jewel i've sought...  there is no time but now there's no where else but here when all else is cold the warmth of holding her near...  tonight the stars in her eyes outshine the stars in the sky tonight love is in her eyes i'll hold, hold her close tonight...  tonight...

						   1. a) Do you understand that "country music" is a sadly over-used oxymoron and should not be indulged in? 1. b) Do you concur that Cake is arguably one of the best bands to ever grace the planet? 2. Are you horribly offended by any or all of the following words or phrases: shit, bastard, fuck, pissed off, dang it all to heck, country music? 3. a) Do you read for your own enjoyment? 3. b) J.D. Salinger is amazing and you won't mind if I gush about spectacular sentences in  A Perfect Day for Bananafish , right? 4. What is the key to holiday entertaining? 5. a) Calling me at 9AM: right or wrong? 5. b) Calling me at 11:30PM: right or wrong? 6. Fill in the blank: Mike "___ ____ __ _______" Westby. 7. When someone tells my Dad to "turn right here" and he mimes intense hand-over-hand steering that would send the car into the ditch if he weren't letting the steering wheel slip through his fingers instead of waiting to actually get to the intersection like a normal person, is that funny? 8. When Sanda and I say "for thee, my lord, for thee", does that mean we're  a) praying, or  b) plotting to kill someone, or  c) reflecting on the sauciness of Norman Reedus? 9. Which hobbit does Sanda lust after: Mr. Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin "Pippin" Took, Merry, or Tom Bombadil? 10. When Sanda and I refer to "Tig", are we referring to one of Pooh-Bear's friends or a game similar to Calvin and Hobbes' "Calvinball"?   Answers: 1. a) Yes 1. b) Yes 2. Hell no.  With the exception of "country music," that's just wrong. 3. a) All the time. 3. b) Please do. 4. Smiles and sauce. 5. a) Wrong. 5. b) Right. 6. "too warm to conform" 7. Yes.  Even after having seen it hundreds of times. 8. Mostly c), but also a little of b). 9. It's all about Pippin.  Bonus points if you knew that Tom Bombadil isn't a hobbit.  Extra bonus points if you were sad not to see him in the movie. 10. Well, you'll just have to watch the LOTR commentaries to find that out, won't you?

						   So I had a weird sleep last night. I woke up at 4:15am ready to go....but then realized that it was 4:15 and my alarm is set for 8am. So I tried to go back to sleep. And I did....sort of. I dozed until around 7:30am when my fat cat jumped on me and meowed obnoxiously in my face that it was time for me to get up and feed her. So I turned over and lied there for a few more minutes and then got up.  Anyways, in the midst of this tossing and turning I had several bizzare dreams. But the part that was really weird was the soundtrack. My whole dream soundtrack was done by this band called  urlLink Lost and Found.  Now I came to hear of this band at a youth retreat that I was at about 4 years ago in the  urlLink East Coast.  It was a lot of fun and the band was crazy. At first we didn't think they were for real. Anywho, Lost & Found is really a great listen and even more of a pleasure to see them live if you get the chance. I just thought it was weird that I had a dream about something that happened 4 years ago and really it was just the setting. It's just strange because I really haven't thought about that stuff in a long, long time.  In my dream we were apartment hunting as well as attending some sort of seminar. I think I am just getting a little stressed out. I have to find a new apartment come September as well as I am going to a  urlLink conference  on Saturday. Anyways, it was just plain weird.   I am going snowboarding today and I am darn excitied!!!!!!!!!!

						   Today I wrote a midterm for my law and politics course. I really like the class and I am learning a lot. But I did not spend a lot time studying. But as I was going over my notes, I saw a case and thought to myself. This is an obscure case, but I should note it. And am I glad that I did. It was one of the options out of the choose 3/5 identify and give the significance. At first I totally could not remember the case, and then I did but I wasn't too sure if I was right. But I came home and checked and I am! Yay for being right! This case was this one about some guy who wanted to teach his kids whatever he wanted. His name was  urlLink Adler.    So after school today I take the bus home like I do everyday and today my bus driver looked and spoke like  urlLink Chef  from South Park. I found that rather entertaining.  Tomorrow I am going snowboarding all day! And I am REALLY EXCITED!!!!!!!!!! I get to use my new board!

						   Hey Sanda, remember this conversation?  Now you will!  :)   Heather Ann: sanda, why are you such a punk? Heather Ann: and what exactly do you have against turtles? Sanda: Listen here Heather Ann, you have not had to deal with turtles like I have had too and frankly I don't appreciate your tone there. I mean honestly, those turtles can be quite vicious at times. Heather Ann: but sanda, to propose that all their legs be broken and to put collars on them so they can't pull their heads into their shells?  that's just strange and unusual, and not quite warranted by the circumstances Sanda: well I think that smashing their shells really would be more productive becasue really collars and broken legs just don't cut it anymore Heather Ann: you're being so unreasonable.  just because you have a turtle infestation and they choose to mate loudly and slowly (as turtles do everything slowly) at odd hours of the night is no reason to KILL them Sanda: i don't want to kill them just invade their home like they have mine..maybe i will mate with my partner on top of their shell loudly. Heather Ann: i wouldn't recommend that course of action, particularly with snapping turtles Sanda: oh but that could add to the excitement and perhaps the stimulation... a little s&m never hurt anyone hehehe Heather Ann: i think there's a slight difference between s&m and jaws that can crush bone.  perhaps your partner has more to lose than you yourself would. Sanda: yeah..but those partners are replaceable... men... a dime a dozen they are! Heather Ann: well, then, proceed with caution at least Sanda: okay.

						   Valentine's Day is soon.  I'm hanging out with my friend  urlLink Meredi  for it, and we are going to have a good time,  sans les garçons .  But, I need ideas.  How can we have a good v-day without boys but without stooping to incredible bitterness?  I'm thinking of buying flowers and chocolates for ourselves and maybe going to supper but avoiding places full of couples... trying to think of single-girl-power movies.... Suggestions?  P.S. I hereby move that Michael Westby should start a blog.  Will someone second the motion?

						   So Friday night my youth group and I are heading up north to have an awesome time at a retreat. Now, I will let you know that I have one girl in my youth group who has severe allergies to about everything on the planet and also has quite bad asthma. It could have been in my discretion to say NO you can't come, but being the nice person I am, she was allowed to come.   The place where the retreat was being held is about a 4 hour drive north. We left at around 6pm and we're just about to pull into the driveway at 10pm. We had made good time and so far everything was going great.  I get on our little walkie talkies to deliever final instructions. Here is our conversation.  Sanda: "Okay everyone, we are here. So what I need you to do is to STAY in the cars until I come back and then we will go from there. If you need to go to the bathroom, you may go to the music hall, BUT COME RIGHT BACK"! Phil: "Okay, but Suzie* is unconscious". (note: this was said without panic and as if it were the most normal thing in the world...and it is almost is...) Sanda: "What! Are you serious"?!!?!? Phil" "chchchchyyysssschchchchc" (that's what it sounded like...you know that horrible feedback sound you get from walkie talkies?) Sanda: "Well....we're here now....."  The car I was in was first in line and we pull up and are greeted by some kids who were interning. They started to give us instructions. Intern: "Welcome to Blizzard! What church are you with? You guys are going to sit back here and wait because it's just a little congested at the front there, okay?" Drew:" ummm...yeah okay...we're from Queen St., the next 2 vehicles are also ours....but you might want to check the last van because we have a girl who is unconscious."  Well needless to say these poor kids who thought they were going to have a boring night directing traffic have now entered into mass pandemonium. Suzie's friends by this point had all jumped out of their vehicles to go to hers to see if they could help. She does tend to be a heavy sleeper and sometimes it just takes FOREVER to wake her up. So we park the cars where we are. The interns are trying to get a hold of the doctor and the director. And they are running around trying to be helpful and get a hold of people while also still trying to direct traffic. We are trying to get all the kids into vehicles that are not the one Suzie is in. We manage to do that and then we wait, and we wait.  The doctor takes Suzie to the infirmary and evenutally the rest of us are allowed to go down and register. While I am registering and having my good friend who is the registrar laugh at me. She is quite familiar with the antics and adventures of my youth group. She knew it was our group that had arrived once she heard 'unconscious girl'. So I get the group registered and the rest of the kids organized and we had over to our cabins. Before I leave the office, I find out that Suize is fine and that she can be collected from the infirmary. Lucky for us, our cabin was right next door.  Well that was my first adventure of the evening! What a way to start a retreat!! Crazy!! But we all had fun, and Suzie was fine for the rest of the weekend and even became a Christian!!!!  There are many other stories but I'll save those for another day. * Suzie is not her real name.

						   Once upon a time there was a girl named Sanda, and she was the sauciest girl in all of St. Catherines, but she was sick.  One fine day, a hobbit named Pippin came to Sanda and brought her magical elvish tea that chased her sniffles away, and then they played Tig until they were tired from laughing so hard.  The End.

						   Hannie, I am sorry. I said I would post my stories but the honest truth is that I am sick and my head is full of snot and therefore I cannot think clearly. Besides my mouse is being a jerk.   If anyone has nothing to do, please come and visit me, tuck me into bed, make me cups o' tea, and read me stories, lots of them. I would truly appreciate that. Thank you.

						   I was on the phone with my Dad this weekend and the subject of counting with your fingers came up.  My French teacher counts like this: thumb, pointer finger, middle finger, ring finger, pinky finger.  I count like this: pointer finger, middle finger, ring finger, pinky finger, thumb.  My Dad counts like my French teacher -- maybe it's a European thing, Dutch immigrant that he is.  I figured my Mom would count like I do, presuming that she taught me, so I told Dad that she would take my side, to which he replied (jokingly), "oh, your mother doesn't know how to count anyways."  Figuring I could get him in trouble, I told him to put Mom on the phone, at which point he became silent for a moment and then came back on, speaking in a high falsetto fake-woman voice, "Hello? This is Annette!"  My parents are incredibly silly.  My Mom's voice isn't even that high, so it was a horrible impression, but it had me on the floor laughing.  It turns out that my Mom counts euro-style too, and my youngest sister counts euro-style BACKWARDS (starting with her pinky), but my middle sister is a true Canadian, just like me.

						   Yesterday I went to the mall to get my jeans hemmed. Yeah, that's right I'm short and I buy my jeans at  urlLink Value Village  and it's great because I spent a total of $20 on jeans that would have cost something like $80. Well anyways I was at the mall and thought I'd pop into the sports store to check out what they had. Of course I end up in the snowboard section pricing yet again. But I resisted and went on with my day and even went to my class! However, after class I find myself at the mall to pick up my jeans and well I find my self back at the sports store. This time leaving as a proud owner of a new  urlLink snowboard!  By the way it is the blue one! I like it a lot! I came home and made me roommate come and watch me go down the tiny little hill that is near my apartment, but it was a lot of fun and more importantly a good board.  Hannie, I remember that game and am super glad that you still have the link. I was thinking about it the other day as we talked about that area of the world in class. It has been awhile since I have played as well, and it will have to wait until next week!  This weekend I am taking my youth group on a retreat. It is going to be    urlLink here  It's going to be a lot of fun. Well I guess that means I should go and pack. Yay for fun in the snow...real snow! Not the yucky black and brown crud you see lying at the side of the road.  urlLink Sick!   Snow should look like  urlLink this  or   urlLink this.

						   Test your  urlLink Middle East geography !  Remember this game, Sanda?  It's been a year since I've played it and I still suck!  But now I remember that Bahrain and Qatar are islands, and I still know where the United Arab Emirates are, so it's sort of okay, right?

						    Interesting  by Lydia Davis (from  Samuel Johnson is Indignant )  My friend is interesting but he is not in his apartment.  Their conversation appears interesting but they are speaking a language I do not understand.  They are both reputed to be interesting people and so I'm sure their conversation is interesting, but they are speaking a language I understand only a little, so I catch only fragments such as "I see" and "on Sunday" and "unfortunately."  This man has a good understanding of his subject and says many things about it that are probably interesting in themselves, but I am not interested because the subject does not interest me.  Here is a woman I know coming up to me.  She is very excited, but she is not an interesting woman.  What excites her will not be interesting, it will simply not be interesting.  At a party, a highly nervous man talking fast says many smart things about subjects that do not particularly interest me, such as the restoration of historic houses and in particular the age of wallpaper.  Yet, because he is so smart and because he gives me so much information per minute, I do not get tired of listening to him.  Here is a very handsome English traffic engineer.  The fact that he is so handsome, and so animated, and has such a fine English accent makes it appear, each time he begins to speak, that he is about to say something interesting, but he is never interesting, and he is saying something, yet again, about traffic patterns.

						   Sanda,  Sometimes when I am at home by myself in the afternoon and I am cooking food, I talk to the food that is cooking.  Right now I am making mashed potatoes and sausages, and when I check on them (they are boiling right now), I tell them to hurry up and be finished.  I think I might have told the potatoes that I loved them.  And I do!  I do love the potatoes!  But maybe I shouldn't be so open about it.  They might get the wrong impression, you know?  After all, I am going to eat them in a little while, and how loving is that?  Next time I will clarify: I love you, but I am going to eat you, and I will love eating you.  :)  Sincerely, Heather Ann

						   I guess a better question would be this:  do I have the right to stop talking to people?  Do I have to feel guilty if I don't want to continue relationships?  Is there a point at which I can say, you know, I've moved on, I don't want to give you a "let's just be friends" speech because I don't really want to spend my time on you anymore at all?  I suppose there are two types of people to deal with here: people who have hurt you badly, and people who you have really grown apart from.  As for people who have hurt me badly, Satan* would be a prime candidate.  I don't wish (much) ill towards him but I really want nothing to do with him, I would be much happier if he lived in a different city.  I have gone out of my way to avoid speaking to him the last few times that we have been in the same building.  (Once again, I moved for a  reason , stop showing up!)  As for people from whom I have grown apart, this chick that my mom said wants to email me would be a prime candidate.  We have nothing in common anymore.  We no longer live in the same city, do not have the same religious beliefs anymore, academics is my life and she never pursued anything past high school as far as I know, we didn't hit it off past about grade six.  So, what's the big deal if I say that I don't want to try again?  She lives three hours away!  It's not like I wouldn't be nice to her if she lived across the hall, but even then I don't think we would hang out much.  So what's the deal, am I allowed to set up my own boundaries here or not?  *not his real name, but might as well be for the purpose of this blog

						   I am having a hard time keeping it together. I am so distracted and unfocused, it is almost to the point of absurdity. Sometimes you wake up and think that perhaps you should have stayed  urlLink in bed !   Last night for dinner I went to my favourite little hang out and grabbed a  urlLink pita . I was sad to notice that it wasn't as hopping as the other location that I used to frequent and both are located in university towns so it was strange to see this location so quiet and desolate. But I had my personal favourite, the chicken souvlaki pita which was extremely yummy to my tummy!  Now Hannie, to answer your question "is it rude to stop talking to people from your long-ago past? Is it rude not to respond to emails if you really have nothing in common anymore?" I will have to answer that later as it is time for class, once again. The short answer would be yes. However, I would be one to base these things according to each situation. More to come later after I have had my cup of tea!

						   I don't think reading week could get here soon enough! This is the first time ever that I will be going somewhere on my reading week. However, it will not be a glorious place of endless fun in the sun. Instead I will be going north, but I still get to take a plane which will be a lot of fun. I've never flown by myself before so this will be an adventure. I am spending my reading week visiting my dear sister who lives in Ontarios other Tdot city,  urlLink Thunder Bay .   I've been quite distracted of late. It was extremely hard to pay attention in lecture yesterday morning, I think it was the pretty clouds. But like all children, give me a piece of paper and a writing utensil and I am set! If you need to distract yourself while on line you can always play with   urlLink this . It's not the best one I've seen, but I can't find the other one and I have to go to work soon. Enjoy the distractions that are around you!  The theme over the last few days has been people from our pasts haunting us. I had a bizzare dream last night where two people from my elementary/high school (yes I went to one of those schools where I went to high school with my entire grade 8 class who was together since ECE), and myself meet at Subway and then had to run for the bus. The whole dream took place in my hometown as well. Bizzare. Anyhow, as for people haunting me from my past...Bring It On! I know I said that they should stay in my past, but to be honest because I've changed so much, I like running into them again and seeing how we have all changed. It really does make life more interesting!

						   More on topic.  Yes, today is Groundhog's Day.  That means that it is also Satan's birthday.  ("Satan" is a clever moniker for someone I don't quite respect, who shall remain otherwise nameless.)  He turns 26 today if I remember correctly.  I should send him dead flowers and an encouragement note  à la Caleb .  "Dear Satan, we encourage you to stop being such a pain, i.e. being in our lives.  Happy birthday.  Now shut up."  Oh, the encouragement board... those were fine times for anarchy and veiled threats... and Adbusters posters mysteriously appearing in the night!  Here's my story about random people from the past from the weekend:  I was on the phone with my mom and she told me that this chick that I used to be friends with in elementary school (until she turned on me and spread ugly rumours about me to the rest of the school, rumours which followed me for years and made elementary school a living  hell  [satan, hell... i'm really developing a theme here!]) wants to know what my email address is because she wants to "catch up".  My mom says she's "reaching out".  I say people from my piddly little hometown should not speak unless spoken to.  Haha, I'm being unnecessarily harsh there, and I know it, but the truth is,  I have moved on, I moved to Toronto for a REASON   and while that reason would have had something to do with Thai food if I had known the glories of such feasts, it didn't because I didn't.  It had much more to do with wanting out of that town and away from those people.  Also: distinct lack of scenic or otherwise acceptable boys.  See also: I was sick of it getting so dark at night that I could actually see stars.  Err... wait, no, that's one of the only things I dislike about Toronto.  Nevermind.  Anyways, she wants to email me and my mom will probably give her my address and I'll either feel bad for being a jerk and email her back, or I'll pretend I never use my email and I never got it, thus solving the problem of Brock Vegas citizens insisting on reappearing in my life without being summoned.  (note to chad if he's gotten in here:  you were summoned, and should move away from brock vegas anyways.  you don't fit in that town.  that's a compliment.)  So, once again, is it rude to stop talking to people from your long-ago past?  Is it rude not to respond to emails if you really have nothing in common anymore?  What about those people who aren't like us, Sanda, those people with emotions and crap... do they get offended over such things?  It's hard to tell when you're as cold and heartless as we are.

						   Note to Sanda on how to make weblinks:    word you want to click on to get to the address  Just take out the extra spaces around the   's and you're good to go!  An example for you:    Defective Yeti  minus extra spaces will give you this:   urlLink Defective Yeti   ça va?

						   So on Friday morning I said that people from my past were haunting me. Then later that same day while I was waiting for the bus with my friend this girl walks by who looked very familiar. Turns out to be a girl I worked with over the summer 6 years ago?! She is doing her coop at my schools library. Apparently you can get your masters in library cirrculation science or something close to that. The words science and library were definetly in that title! Crazy!  This morning the clouds were really pretty. They were grey with some pink and of course, the clouds themselves were white. But the colours behind the clouds were very pretty. They looked sort of like  urlLink this .  Very enjoyable on the bus ride up to school!  Today is  urlLink Ground Hog Day . Enjoy!

						   So, this is my last week of classes, and I finished my Independent Study in Inuktitut last night.  It was the least structured course I have ever taken, which was supremely frustrating, but incredibly interesting.  I learned how to write in syllabics (see post title) and how to answer questions without giving an opinion at all.  They answer practically anything with "mmm" which basically means "I acknowledge that you just said something, but I don't feel like commenting" or "yes, you're absolutely right".  It's hard to tell.  It's also incredibly hard to stop doing once you've started.  I think I'll be trying to weed that one out of my speech for years to come.  The rest of this post is Linguistics ramblings, and you will read it and you will LOVE it.  Because I say so.  In Inuktitut, the word order is completely different.  Or, rather, the word  chunk  order is completely different.  In English, we have separate words for almost every bit of meaning.  In some words, we manage to pack some more meaning in there, like the word "beautiful", combining the thoughts "beauty" and "full of".  In Inuktitut, word order does not matter at all in the sentence.  For example:   nunaqaqtunga Torontomi   means "I live in Toronto", or literally "land-have-I Toronto-in".  If we were to say this:   Torontomi nunaqaqtunga   it would mean exactly the same thing, and they really don't care which way you say it.  Really.  No preference whatsoever.  If you ask them, "Which sounds better, this or that?", they will say "Mmm."  :)  One of the first things we learned was how to ask people how they are:   qanuippit? --> [qanuq (how) + ip (makes it a question) + pit (you singular)]   and then the answer is:   qanuinngittunga --> [qanuq (how) + nngit (not) + tunga (I)]   so it basically means "I am not how" or "there is nothing spectacularly out of the ordinary for you to be asking me 'how' about" or "I am fine".  Another answer could be:   nammaktunga --> [nammak (fit) + tunga (I)   or "I fit", which I LOVE, it is such a good phrase.  How am I doing?  I feel like I fit in my life.  That is a good feeling.  Oh, and I'm willing to bet some of my easter chocolate (the reason for the season!) that none of you can pronounce the words with q's in them, because you've never made or heard that sound in your life.  It's called a uvular stop, and it's like a 'k' sound, but you make the 'k' on your velum (soft palate) and you make the 'q' on your uvula (commonly known as the "hangy ball").  It's like a French 'r', but it's a stop (like p, t, k, g, d).  I can make it now, but that's only because I took the course and we spent some time on it.  If you bring me cookies, I'll show you how to do it.  :)

						   Yesterday I went to this church service not really realizing that it was in a Pentecostal church, but that is okay. Anyways, all I have to say is this; I tried to find a Bible, thinking that like most churches there is at least one Bible per pew. Well, at this church it was not so. BUT what was in EVERY pew, was a box of Kleenex. (I suppose I should say tissues as they were not of the brand Kleenex). Anyways, just an observation.

She, too, knows the supreme value of birthday week, she called me on the first day of hers just to say "I am right and you are wrong because it's my birthday week, nyah nyah!"  She makes me laugh harder than any other living being, and she has a sauciness factor of 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, 7 being the highest.  Please send her email and make her feel loved!  :)

						   My roommate and I were invited out to dinner last night. It is her last week in St. Catharines and so the pastor had us over last night to wish her the best. The following took place...  A discussion occurs between the pastor and his wife about where their kids are. It so happened that Brendan, their 15 yr old son was in bed taking a nap. So they were discussing who should go and wake him up. (I think you can see where this might be going...) It was suggested that Amanda and I go and wake up Brendan. Now I was thinking this is a bad idea...but I mean really what could go wrong?! So we quietly go up the stairs and open Brendan's door and go in. On the count of 3 Amanda went to put her knee on the bed to lean over and shake him, and I sat on the bottom corner. We did this at the same time. Throughout the house echos this crashing  CATHUNK ! The bed is now on an angle that was not in its original design. Brendan's face was priceless. Brendan looked so confused as to way he was now sideways and why Amanda and I were in his bedroom. Amanda and I had complete disbelief on our face that this was actually happening. The three of us had this "What in the hey now!?" expression going on. Brendan is now on a bed that was now slanted. Amanda and I were laughing in a we are so dead and now we are really nervous type of way, like giggling nervously. And Brendan was so confused... The pastor comes upstairs and we just sort of look at him and kind of shrug our shoulders and were like, "i have no idea what happened...type of way." So we explained what we did, and we had a look at the bed and all 3 of us are talking at the same time, and we just couldn't help but laugh the entire time. And we are blubbering on and on and aplogizing and what not... I sheepish said that I guess I won't be getting next week's paycheck.... At first I think he had disbelief that we actaully did a lot of damage. Cuz' we did, the slot that the metal part of the frame sits in fell out because the wood that held it in was totally cracked. Like the bed cannot be fixed.   Luckily for us, they were entirely gracious and merciful about the entire incident and it was the mainstay joke for the rest of the evening. Oh sweet heaven's to betsy! what a night!

						   when this is my playlist and I've been listening to songs like this obsessively for days.  Aimee Mann/Michael Penn - You've Got To Hide Your Love Away Badly Drawn Boy - A Minor Incident Badly Drawn Boy - I Was Wrong Badly Drawn Boy - You Were Right Ben Harper - She's Only Happy in the Sun Ben Harper - The Drugs Don't Work (live cover of The Verve's song) Ben Harper - Walk Away Bright Eyes - Bowl of Oranges Counting Crows - Colorblind Counting Crows - Speedway Damien Rice - Cannonball Damien Rice - Cheers Darlin' Damien Rice - Cold Water Damien Rice - I Remember Damien Rice - The Blower's Daughter Damien Rice - Volcano Damien Rice - Toffee Damien Rice/Nina Simone - Be My Husband Derek Webb - Wrong Man Jack Johnson - You're Missing Me Jack Johnson/Ben Harper - Flake Liz Phair - Emotional Rescue Liz Phair - Explain it to Me Liz Phair - Fuck and Run Liz Phair - Shatter Lou Reed - Perfect Day Pedro the Lion - Bad Diary Days Pete Yorn - Lose You Sarah Slean - My Invitation Sarah Slean - Weight Sinead O'Connor - Black Boys on Mopeds Sinead O'Connor - No Man's Woman Tegan and Sara - City Girl Tegan and Sara - Don't Confess Tegan and Sara - Not Tonight Travis - The Humpty Dumpty Love Song Travis - Luv Travis - The Last Laugh of the Laughter Travis - Writing to Reach You Ween - Stay Forever White Stripes - There's No Home For You Here  I'm not sure how I've had a blog this long without quoting Nick Hornby, but here we go:   Some of my favourite songs: "Only Love Can Break Your Heart" by Neil Young; "Last Night I Dreamed That Somebody Loved Me" by the Smiths; "Call Me" by Aretha Franklin; "I Don't Want to Talk About It" by anybody.  And then there's "Love Hurts" and "When Love Breaks Down" and "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart" and "The Speed of the Sound of Loneliness" and "She's Gone" and "I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself" and . . . some of these songs I have listened to around once a week, on average (three hundred times in the first month, every now and again thereafter), since I was sixteen or nineteen or twenty-one.  How can that not leave you bruised somewhere?  How can that not turn you into the sort of person liable to break into little bits when your first love goes all wrong?  What came first—the music or the misery?  Did I listen to music because I was miserable?  Or was I miserable because I listened to music? Do all those records turn you into a melancholy person?  People worry about kids playing with guns, and teenagers watching violent videos; we are scared that some sort of culture of violence will take them over.  Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands—literally thousands—of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss.  The unhappiest people I know, romantically speaking, are the ones who like pop music the most; and I don't know whether pop music has caused this unhappiness, but I do know that they've been listening to the sad songs longer than they've been living the unhappy lives.   Nick Hornby,  High Fidelity , p. 24–25

						    urlLink This site  belongs to a Ukranian woman who has a nuclear research pass, and so is allowed to ride her motorcycle through Chernobyl and area.  She has set up a tour of the area on her site.  Her English isn't spectacular, but you understand, and she has some great photos and thoughts on here.  Very disturbing.

						   Today I went to an honours symposium for political science students that I was invited to. It is in a hidden place at Brock called Alphies Trough. The only thing I have heard about it is that it is really nice but really far back. Well today after only being at Brock for what, 7 months!? I discovered where Alphies Trough is. It really is in a nice place. It is on the escarpment and there are trails all around, which I will discover in more detail on Monday and it will be fun.  Anyhow, after the symposium I ran into a friend who also did not know where Alphie's was. And when asked where it was, I responded with, 'it's out back'. Truly, at Brock our school is small, it really is like a large scale high school. And there is no other way to describe where Alphies is other than out back. Out back yonder can also work. Not that I am complaining about the size of my university, it is sort of nice in some ways, but it is sort of weird to be in a place of higher learning and not really have far to go, well unless you have a seminar in East Academic, but that's a whole other story. But in the winter it is pretty sweet that I never have to go outside to get to different parts of the school, it might take me a bit longer, but I don't have to go outside...and it is way better than just going up or down a couple floors, like some other schools I know of.

						   Today my Linguistics teacher told me that if I transferred to Queens, she would make me her T.A. when I was in fourth year.  She also told me that the Linguistics program at my campus isn't good enough for me, that I should either go to Queens or switch to York's main campus.  She's one of my favourite profs ever, it is so great to get validated by people you look up to.  I mean, I am fairly certain that I'm smart and I hope that I can actually produce something worthwhile in the world of academia, but it is hard to look at yourself and say "yeah, this is possible" sometimes.  There's just something empowering about hearing "you can do this, you will do very well, go somewhere that is good enough for you" from someone you admire.

						   Back in the fall Amanda and I had an adventure. Well we had several and not just in the fall...anyways on this particular adventure we (meaning mainly me) pulled 2 7ft(height) 12"(wide) planks out of a river that leads to Lake Ontario. We carried one home with us and set it in our bathtub to dry. The other we left under the bridge with hopes to retrive it later in the spring, when it was warmer and not so icy and wet out. So tonight we were on a walk and we stopped at the bridge because we like to look at the rushing, perilous water and we noticed that our plank is BACK in the river! How dare it defy us! All our hard work to drag it out of very frigid water (which involved me getting a soaker) and then dragging it to shore! Argh! We deliberate about rescuing it again but then decided that it should stay in the river. When we go on our next walk, if it is there then maybe we will rescue it, for a second time.

						   Good -er: adj. From the root good. er added to emphasize just how good something may be. Only used to describe things that contain the false illusion of virture and will be quickly forgotten of. Also used to describe things that are "good in thing".  e.g. Watching someone spectacularly wipe out snowboarding the term gooder may be applied. "Oh man! That was a gooder!" (May only be used in that context if the person is all right, as in not dead).  The History of the word 'Gooder'  In the year 2001 myself and 12 others had to spend 4 months in an isolated town in Northern Ontario for our program. Now the place where we were staying was a wonderful place filled with lots of fun. So it wasn't as bad as it sounds. Anyhow, one day while we were wintering camping (ah, yes that was an assignment believe it or not!), someone stepped in a bank of wet snow and received what was referred to as a soaker. A soaker is when your entire foot (you must be wearing a sock or a piece of footwear on the wet foot for the term to apply)unintentionally gets soaked from an obscene amount of water. It usually means that there is more water in one's shoe than anything else. That is what is meant by a soaker. It also only applies when ignorance or childish fun accompanies the activity. For example, putting on a shoe and purposely stepping in a tub of water does not grant you use of the term soaker. Jumping in a snow bank in a ditch beknownst to what is under the snow like my brother last week, grants you use of the word. Also puddle jumping allows for the application of the term soaker. Now, someone had received a soaker and well because we were all tired and cold and wet, we were many things...silly, grumpy, miserable, giddy etc. Anyhow, someone had said "Well that was a gooder", after some received their soaker. It had sort of turned into what words can we add 'er' game. Many others were tried such as bester, awesomer and of course funner. As you can see...tired and cold. So being a world unto ourselves for 4 months, the terms soaker and gooder stuck because well they were the only ones that were fun and less on the stupid side of things compared to some of the other ones we came up with.   There you have it! Yeah, I know, I'm not in linguistics...

						   This is a good song....listen and enjoy and love... yeah do that...  Fell In Love by Moxy Frovous  Something I never would have known Not knowing knowledge never enobles All her ideas were like smoke rings, I had to know things She was a tangle of questions How many eggs make up a pound? How many ears of corn in the niblets? I was a person who would censor "Pee Wee's adventures" She was exceedingly liberal And we fell in love And the sunshine shone from the sunshine above Fell in love, whole loaf love Try not to think while your inside Just keep your wide eyes wide wide open I made a meal of the lighting, this was exciting We had a real urban drama She always said it again Just when she'd said it, that's when she'd say it (how's that again?) She said my pasta was delicious, but repetitious That kind of thing made me crazy And we fell in love And the sunshine shone from the sunshine above Fell in love, whole loaf love Take a look around, the sun has gone down And I've had a good time, have you had a good time? I've loved without loss, I've put down my cross You know what I know, an' I'm goin' go She set my schoolhouse on fire Down in the fire the angels were singing Notice a beautiful fire heavenly choir

						   Someone, let's call him  urlLink Mike  (to just pick a name completely at random), has been linking to this blog under a number of different phrases.  So far, these have included:  - Funny limericks - Ask Heather Ann about [name deleted to protect the innocent] - suggestive emoticons - Because clowns are scary - Complaints department - Pictures to build your self esteem - Amanda finds this odd  So, in retaliation, I have changed his link to "vogon poetry central" — a strong insult indeed!  And with a geek factor due to the Douglas Adams reference, so it's highly appropriate.  Stay tuned, this isn't over yet.

						   So yesterday I was sort of just relaxing in the afternoon evening because I had worked hard on my paper. So I came up to Brock and handed it in and went to my seminar to get a different paper back. And I did well considering that one was written in one night and I still couldn't tell you what I was arguing, but I got a 78...so I am not complaining.  To celebrate our laziness and decent marks, my friend Gavin and I went to McDonalds, where we as Brock students can get any mcdeal for just 3.99 - are YOU lovin' it?!  Anyways, after I was hanging out in the computer lab, chatting it up on msn when my friend Steph invited me out to Issacs (the campus bar) for the finale of battle of the bands. So since I wasn't doing anything I said sure! And there I discovered love at first sight! I only could stay for one band thanks to the retarded transit system and due to the fact that I live on the other side of town...but nonetheless I got to hear this band called  urlLink Parsin.  And they are pretty good for a young band. They have a FooFighters, Dave Matthew's sort of style/sound. I liked it. But what I liked even more was the drummer :)! (If you watch the intro you can see many saucy pictures of the dummer!)

						    urlLink Yes, he used to be a Prada model, and a damn fine one at that.   You know it's all about the lop-sided grin:    He's touching his mouth in half the pictures I have found so far, I think it's supposed to be sexy:    Okay, I'm going to do homework now.  Honest.  No, really.

						   Other than Hannie and myself, Norman Reedus is the only thing that is saucier than us daily. Mmmmmm, let us take a moment and mediate upon that sauciness. Done. Wasn't that wonderful!?  Another movie that Norman Reedus performs in is called Gossip and it is an excellent movie that I recommend you buy for my movie collection.   To continue enjoying Norman Reedus Day 2004, you may go here for more  urlLink sauciness and enjoyment.   If you are not having a wonderful day, pause,... and remember Norman Reedus and all will be well.  (I suppose that boarders on the line of heresy... but I guess that's not out of the blue for me...hehe)

						   Sanda and I have decided to dedicate this day of blogging to the saucy goodness of Norman Reedus, especially for his work in Boondock Saints, the movie from which we stole the name for our blog.  Also, we haven't seen anything else that he's been in (Beat, Floating, who has ever heard of these movies? not us).  One of the key features of NRD2004 is the visual evidence, so here we go.  Now, Norman's character, Murphy, is a devout (and perhaps too literal) Catholic:    He looks damn fine in a blood-stained bathrobe:    He is adept at tying his own shoes (a skill that all boys should have!):    He throws his arms up in the air when he is happy, something that you can catch Sanda doing from time to time:    So, let's all sit back and appreciate the saucy goodness:    I'd like to close this post with a prayer, will you all fold your hands and bow your heads, but don't close your eyes because this is text dammit and you won't be able to read it.  This is the McManus family prayer, take it to heart and meditate on it:   "And Shepherds we shall be For thee, my Lord, for thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand Our feet may swiftly carry out Thy commands. So we shall flow a river forth to Thee And teeming with souls shall it ever be. In Nomeni Patri Et Fili Spiritus Sancti."

						   Today was a fairly good day.  I had my Intro to Linguistics class this morning, and my prof came up to me on break and told me that if I'm going to continue in Linguistics, I should switch to main campus because my campus is little and does not offer much.  She thinks I could go really far and so I should go somewhere with more resources, so either York Main or Queens (she loves Queens, she wants to marry it).  I am not considering Queens, because I don't want to move, but I am really considering going to main campus next year.  It would mean giving up on French again, which is sad because I have made a lot of progress this year, but French is hard and sometimes I resent what it does to my average.  It would also mean that I would have a commute of at least an hour to and from school, which is a pain in the ass, but I could handle it.  I'm good at reading on buses.  So, I think maybe I should switch to main campus, and then Sanda should come to York and we will be the sauciest girls ever.  One of the buttons on my coat fell off today and I was going to sew it back on when I got home, but then I realised that I have a huge gash on my thumb and I can't really hold a needle properly.  But my roommate, KP, saved the day once again.  She is super-double-plus-awesome.  I also had a date this afternoon and went to the  urlLink Toronto Art Expo  which was really interesting and they had a lot of really beautiful stuff.  It's nice to see new art and get to talk to the artists.  It's not nice to be a poor student and want to buy art that is much too expensive for me.  But hey, I get to see it for only $8, that's not so bad.  Also, we went out for sushi, and I have this to say about sushi: I am not sure if I like it or not.  It is okay.  It is not my favourite thing in the world, and I am not fond of the seaweed wrapping doin's, and I find that a lot of the stuff that comes with it is fairly bland, and I  know  that that's what the sauces are there for, but they never seem to really get absorbed into the rest of it and then it's still bland... and I would just rather eat something else.  But the chicken part was really good.  Speaking of chicken, this boy that I have been going on dates with (I need to think of a clever moniker for him) is partially vegetarian.  He does not eat mammals, because he feels that they are more intelligent and he feels bad.  But chicken is okay.  ("Because chickens are eeeeeevil!")  And shrimp, but not shark.  He says that it is a personal thing and he does not care what other people eat, but I feel weird eating meat when I am with him, because I wonder if he does think that I am being horrible.  Probably not, but maybe.  Meh.

						   I am going to the  urlLink Toronto Art Expo  today (with a boy!) and it will be fun.  They have a gallery on their website and some of the paintings look absolutely incredible, so I am going to get to see them in person, and you are not, nyah nyah Nyah nyah NYAH nyah.  :)  In other news, my thumb is basically useless due to the huge gash in it.  Maybe I will get my roommate to take a Polaroid of the carnage and scan it in for you guys, it's pretty gross.  However, it may be useful for you to note the following things that you use your opposable thumbs for:  - washing your hair (important!) - zippers, buttons - basic removal of/putting on of clothing - opening bandaid packages (imagine my frustration here!) - picking up pots/pans - opening doors (although one can maneuver around this without the END of the thumb, which is the problem in my case) - hitchhiking - holding hot cups of tea  This is going to be very frustrating for a long time, I think.  It is just on the edge of needing stitches, but not quite.  It is just painful and a right pain in the ass.

						   So, you know how when you were little your mom told you to cut AWAY from your thumb?  I have never listened to that advice, it is more difficult and I am lazy.  Well, now I am lazy and BLEEDING.  Thanks to my excellent sharp knives and my own stupidity, I cut a huge chunk out of my thumb.  Argh.  Blood everywhere!  Panic when I should be studying!

						   I know that it has been some time since I have posted, but I have been busy. And still an overdue paper calls to me... But here I am blogging with nothing too new to tell, except that I GOT A JOB! Indeed my summer will be spent in a greenhouse playing with plants and getting dirty! Anyways...the reason I haven't been blogging is because my youth group went on yet another retreat and then I went snowboarding on Tuesday...yay for fresh powder! Then the regular jazz of school and work and such. And now my charming little bro is down for a couple days to hang out. So we are going to go and find ourselves an adventure now!

						   Today my new roommate wrote "HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY!!!" on our whiteboard in  permanent marker .  I was less than impressed.  However, I did the smart thing and turned to Google.  There I learned that permanent marker can be removed from whiteboards by going over the offending marks with a dry-erase marker, and the washing it off with a cloth.  And it's true!  So there's your tip for the day, learn and enjoy.

						   Ladies and gentlemen of our little blogging community, it has come to my attention that we may be able to do something about the lack of sweet turtle goodness.  It turns out that discovery.com has a  urlLink feedback form .  Shall we email them daily pleading for the return of the coveted webcam?  Our pleas should be eloquent and over-the-top in order to be effective.  We should overrun their Inbox with emails which are at once overly-formal and silly to the extreme.  Do not let our turtles (and divers!) go unwatched for another day!  I am starting a draft of an email to discovery.com, which follows:   It is with great distress that I have noted that the OceanTank webcam has been down for the past few weeks.  My friends and I are slightly addicted to the sweet turtle goodness that it has brought into our lives, formerly filled only with studying, as we are but poor students, chained to our desks all day long.  One day we happened across the OceanTank webcam and suddenly our lives were changed — we became overly fond of the turtles, not to mention a few of the divers.  Your webcam brought a spark of joy into our lives, a spark which is "temporarily out of service".  Please endeavour to return the webcam to life as soon as possible!  Exams are coming and we are growing desperate!

						   1. Insisting that people love something that they obviously don't love.  Like cold weather or making me tea. 2. Answering people's arguments with "that's neither here nor there" and then going down silly rabbit trails. 3. Pestering my mom by trying to hold her hand while she is doing something that requires the use of both hands, like making supper.  ("But Mom, I love you!! Why won't you hold my hand??") 4. Bare feet.  I don't know why.  I just like them.  Especially when I am lying on a blanket in a field in the summer and I have bare feet and they are spooning.  Do feet spoon?  You know what I mean.  I love that. 5. Asking people if they love me and if they answer 'yes', answering with 'feed my sheep'.  Sometimes it's funny to pretend to be Jesus.

						   So, on our links list to your right, you will see a link entitled "sweet turtle goodness".  However, it hasn't been very sweet lately.  Why?  Because for some retarded reason, the webcam in the Boston Aquarium has been down for nigh on a month now.  How sad is that?  I miss the turtles, and the stingrays, and the fishes, and wresting control of the webcam from Sanda, and the diver that waved at us, and how much time I spent in my Phonetics class (which was in a computer lab) watching turtles swim around instead of listening to the prof.  Come back, sweet webcam!

						   Can I just state for the record that there is  snow  on my  balcony  at this precise moment? And in the air and on the ground and the point is that it is not going away and dammit I have a date today and I wanted it to be nice and springtime already!  Bah.   AND , to top it all off, it's not my birthday week anymore, and the boy who I'm going on a date with  knows it  and understands that now I can't justify anything in a cute way.  Darn it all to heck!

						   When I was in Thunder Bay, I bought a new  urlLink toque.  I already own another toque and jacket by the same company, they make some good stuff. I LOVE my toque though, it's the one called Celtic, which is awesome because I bought it not knowning the name and well I love toques and Celtic things and so to have the two combined! Sweet lovin'!  Anyways, I Love my toque so much that I wear it everyday all day, well that's not entirely true....but I DO wear it often...and I DID wear it ALL day yesterday, from the time I left for Brock until I returned. It was wonderful. Yay Toques!  P.S. You know that everytime that you see the word toque, I'm not saying it...but singing it!!!

						   I was discussing the term "lust" last night with my best friend (who is like Sanda, but also Wonderful, not that Sanda lacks anything, especially in the department of sauciness) and we realised that we define it quite differently.  So, in the interest of discovering what is more common, I thought I would ask for comments on here.  Okay, so here is the distinction:  1. Lust as thought/desire but not intention.  Examples include anything from "let's meditate on the pirate-y goodness" to "I would really like to do ____ to ____".  However, this is limited to attraction and desire ONLY, it does not move into the realm of intentions or resolutions.  Which brings us to definition #2.... 2. Lust as extreme desire which includes intention.  Unrestrained desire.  Takes the second example from definition 1 but adds "and I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure it happens".  Such thoughts do not necessarily result in action, but they're going to damn well try.  So, where does your definition of "lust" lie?  1 or 2?  Or something else entirely?  Do you see lust as including all sexual attraction?  Do you see it as only the most extreme of sexual attractions?  Does one have to intend to do something about the desire in order for it to be categorized as lust?  Give me your thoughts.

						   Well big disappointment happening over here. As part of my birthday week I had planned a snowboarding adventure to take palce this afternoon. Well here I am blogging instead of listening to mindless chit chat on the bus right now, because I am staying at school because my snowboarding adventure got CANCELLED! So I am disappointed.   So today the  urlLink weather  is beautiful outside. A little chilly and yes there was frost on the ground, but nothing a toque and a vest can't handle and indeed that winter jacket can stay in the closet! I would like to take my 2 hour break in the afternoon and discover the escarpment perhaps. Apparently there are some nice trails around the school. We will see how true this is.  Which reminds me, my goal for next year is to start an Outdoors club at Brock, We offer recreatin & leisure studies but have no club!! We definetly need one to help support my habits of snowboarding, hiking and canoeing.  urlLink BUSU  offers nothing to help encourage outdoor activities. Tis true that I go to a school dedicated to Jock's and their survival and there is a lot offered through our  urlLink recreation services , but it does not completely satisfy.

						    urlLink How To By You  is a communal blog where you get to ask random questions and have them answered by complete strangers, sometimes seriously, but more often in jest.  Past topics have included how to:  - get a song out of your head - hand wash clothes - get to work on time - explain the logic of women's shopping habits  and many many more.  I like it a lot.  :)

						   That's right it's my birthday today....so if you've forgotten, then you still have a chance to redeem yourself! It's been a pretty good day except for the headache, but that meant coming home from school early, so it works out. Best present thuse far...the pots set from my mom, then comes the iron and toaster from Amanda.  Tonight, dinner is STEAK in Port Dalhouise. mmmmmmmm steak. Sweet goodness!

						   Stole this idea from  urlLink Chad  who stole it from  urlLink Trevor  who stole it from someone I don't know, etc.  Basically, you pull up WinAmp (or whatever inferior mp3 player you happen to use), load up all of your music, put it on random, and write down the first 10 things it picks, embarrassing or not.  I cheated a little bit, I took out "Coffee Sandwich" by Bob and Doug McKenzie because it's not really a song.  Anyways, here's my list:  1. Beastie Boys - Intergalactic Planetary 2. Andy Kaufman - One More Song for You 3. Lorne Elliot - Gonna Get Granny Plastered 4. Kevin Ramessar - Giuliani 3 5. Tegan & Sara - Time Running 6. Cake - The Roof is on Fire 7. Pedro the Lion - Bad Diary Days 8. Me First And The Gimme Gimmes - I Would Walk 500 Miles 9. Caedmon's Call - The Only One (this song will be deleted soon, anyone want to buy some CDs?) 10. Steve Taylor - The Moshing Floor  That was not very representative of what I usually listen to, but that is probably because it was a 10 song sample of a collection that is over 2000 songs...  The stuff I've been playing most lately has been more like this:  1. Damien Rice - Cannonball 2. Ben Harper - She's Only Happy In The Sun 3. Polyphonic Spree - It's the Sun 4. Badly Drawn Boy - A Minor Incident 5. Sarah Slean - My Invitation 6. The Beta Band - She's The One 7. Lou Reed - Heroin 8. Carla Bruni - La Dernière Minute 9. The White Stripes - There's No Room For You Here 10. Bright Eyes - Bowl of Oranges

						   Well that's what it feels like outside....the wind is bashing against the windows and the sky has these wicked dark clouds against the twlight of evening. Actually it looks awesome outside and I just thought I mention that. Things are going way better than they were this morning. I went for a walk when I got home and it was AWESOME! I went and played in Lake Ontario, well I didn't go in it, but I wandered along the shore. I yelled Hi to you Hannie, I hope you heard! Anyways, it is/was quite lovely out. I cannot wait for summer!!!

						   Okay, so I got contacts a week ago today, and they are still super-weird.  Let me just say though, I was so brave in getting them at all, because I have a huge fear of anything ever happening to my eyes.  (i.e. I do not open my eyes under water, I do not touch my eyes, I do not think about touching my eyes, the thought of laser eye surgery makes me want to vomit in horror, etc.)  But,  now , I can touch my eyes no problem.  And it's okay.  And I have discovered that the reason it hurts when you touch your eyes is that your hands are DIRTY and if you would just WASH THEM, it would be okay.  So, now I wash my hands.  It's a new thing for me!  Okay, no, I'm kidding about that, I'm like a hand-washing-machine, I can kick your hand-washing ass.  And I will!  And then I will wash my hands!  Okay, so, my contacts.  (right... the subject of the post...)  I have gotten over my fear of putting them in and taking them out, but they are sort of cloudy, and they are trial ones and one of them is not quite the right prescription, which is a pain, but I am going to the eye doctor next week and she will give me better ones and then it will be all good.  At this point, I can wear them for about 8 hours, and then my eyes get tired and dry and angry and itchy and I have to take them out.  I'm building up resistance to them though.  Yay for me being brave and getting over long-held fears!

						   Sometimes when it's raining all I want to do is sit with a cup of tea and watch the world pass me by while listening to emo music or jazz. Today is a good day to do that except that I have class which I need to go to as well as hand in resumes to the school. But if I could, I would stay home all day and listen to  urlLink Sarah Slean.  As well as the cd I made for my mom which rocks, it's called Broken Egg Shells.   So I had a really weird dream last night, well more like this morning and it sort of threw me off kilter a little bit. But I know that everything is going to be okay and I don't need to worry about it. However, it is still troubling me and I really want to ignore it, but it is very hard to.  Anyways, today maybe because I had a bad dream, maybe because it's raining, maybe because of other things.....I just want to cry. I hardly  EVER  feel like this,... I hardly ever feel... haha! But seriously, I think I could just ball my eyes out about now and for no reason whatsoever. If this is what it means to be feminine, then I hate it. I know I am coming out of my tomboyish ways...but this is just ridiculous because it isn't even logical! I think I need another cup of tea and me and Mr. Bear will sit and listen to the rain.  P.S. Mr. Bear is the teddy bear my mommy made for me when I was baby and I occasionaly still sleep with him, or take him places with me. Maybe today he would enjoy a trip to Brock.

						   This has nothing at all to do with my actual life, of course not, don't be silly.  Anyways, here's the question.  If two people start dating and they really like each other, but they have either been burned by relationships in the past, or feel inexperienced, or have gotten really used to being single and don't want to jump right into something, and they decide to "take it slow" emotionally, what does that mean?  Like, in a practical sense?  Does that mean, let's not talk to each other every day?  Or, does that mean, let's not get too physically involved?  Or, does that mean, let's mess around a bit but not call each other boyfriend/girlfriend?  Or, does that mean, I really like you but need to get to know you for a while before I make any decisions about this and in the meantime we're just going to wing it?  And if it's the latter, what does THAT mean?  Hypothetically, of course.

						   Well we are right now in the full swing of Heather Ann's birhtday week, but let us not forget that this only means more celebrating is on the way because it preceeds MY birthday!!! So far birthday week is off to a fantastical start!!! We had some pre-birthday week fun, by having a snowboarding adventure on Saturday. That was a lot of  FUN!!!!  Monday, which was the offical start to birthday week inlcuded my friend Christine bringing me a cookie to our geography class (and she didn't even  know  it was my birthday week)! My friend Gavin came over last night and made Amanda and I dinner. It was good. Yay for hot dogs and french fries!!! Takes me back to the days of my childhood! And then last night I had a  wonderful  chat with a  wonderful  gentlemen, which will make me smile all day!   May the goodness of birthday week continue to flow endlessly!!!

						   I went to the walk-in clinic and talked to an excellent funny doctor who put me at ease right away and joked around and checked me out and said that I don't have symptoms of an ulcer, I have symptoms of  urlLink IBS .  Which makes sense since it is a stress-related thing, and that would be my life right now, aside from the wonderful events of yesterday.  Anyways, he said that he could prescribe expensive drugs to deal with my symptoms, but that would not cure it, that I just have to deal with stress and that it will take care of itself.  So, I have to deal with my life.  Woohoo.

						   Last winter, I was doing some work (real work, for money even!) in York's Scott Library's Special Collections.  I was supposed to request a photocopy of a letter to bpNichol from Margaret Avison, two of Canada's better poets.  Don't worry if their names are unfamiliar, I had never heard of either of them before this year either, although I had read Margaret Avison's  urlLink The Swimmer's Moment .  Anyways, the letter was in something called  Journeying & the Returns .  I was expecting a book.  I got a book, but it came in a box with a whole bunch of other stuff.  It was a collection of poems, but unlike any collection I had seen before.  Some of the poems were folded and cut or torn in interesting ways.  Most of them were typewritten, rarely just from left to right.  Some had specially made envelopes.  One of them contained instructions to fold it in a certain way and then set it on fire.  This collection also came with a record of sound poetry.  Not just poetry readings, sound poetry.  I'll come back to that in a second.  In short, this was poetry that was meant to be played with.  It was to be touched, heard, read, mangled, even burnt (felt, smelt).  This was poetry that worked with four of the five senses.  This was interactive.  This was addictive and it was distracting me from my job.  So I reluctantly stopped playing with it and continued working.  Yesterday I went back and requested it again, and I took my time and experienced some of the goodness of bpNichol.  Michael Ondaatje said this about bp: "Barrie Nichol wrote songs and books for children, drew cartoons, designed computer poems, cut records, wrote operas, wrote musicals, wrote the long poem of our time, wrote sonnets, told bad jokes, made photo-montages, wrote concrete poems, belonged to the sound poetry group The Four Horsemen, wrote essays, was a teacher.  No other writer of our time and place was so diverse, attempted so much, and never lost sight of his intent."  There is a website called  urlLink Borders  that has RealPlayer files of the record that came with  Journeying & the Returns .  It is sound poetry.  It is bpNichol playing with speech sounds, with words, with homophones and phonemes and syllables and beats and rhythms.  My favourite is  urlLink Beach at Port Dover .  I didn't like it at first, because I didn't know what to expect, but as I grew used to the idea of sound poetry, that one grew on me.  I like how passionate he gets in the "oom pa pa OOM pa" parts and how he makes "pitter patter pit pat" sound like rain.  I also like  urlLink Not What the Siren Sang but What the Frag Ment .  Listen to them a few times.  Get used to it before you just decide that it's weird.  Think about the fact that he would go to little tiny rural towns and do sound poetry events and get so wrapped up in the poem that he would forget where he was and almost walk off the stage by accident.  Let go of your traditional ideas of language, of poetry, of words and grammar and proper use of syntax and sound.  Get caught up in it.  bpNichol wrote this poem for his wife, Ellie:   Love Song 6  For Ellie on her birthday (November 19/73, 12:02 a.m.)   all the ways that i had thot of loving filled as i can be with such conceits disappear in the face of you the place you do take in my heart  all the awkwardness that i feel in phrasing poems that speak of my loving for you caught as they do catch in a moment's saying so that i feel embarrassed or arrogant hesitating where i should be sure are nothing when i hold you unable to speak  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reach over the years of our separate growing older together  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; measured in time we note startled no closer to knowing "what love is" except that respect  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;that continual wonder i still dissemble before more in love with you than ever   He also wrote this poem, called  Blues :    Here is a verse from  Phrasing    2  mental home a state  strictly within my  proven &nbsp; shall (as if to encompass a shift in thot or tone)  meta-  physical phorical   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – man i did not know &  the beginning of another story   Some things to notice there.  "meta-" is meant to match with "physical," "phorical," and "man i did not know &".  He plays with the boundary between printed and spoken language—since "meta" and "met a" sound the same, they are used the same way.  Also, you may have noticed that he spells "thot" instead of "thought".  This is because he wants to avoid the connotation of "ugh," which is a sound of disgust or disappointment.  He also says "tho" instead of "though," and drew  urlLink cartoons  about "Tho(ugh)t Balloons."  You need to learn tricks like that to read bpNichol poems.  Why my high school teachers never told us about stuff like this, I'll never understand.  Maybe more people would have gotten interested if we would have known that poets don't just write about surviving the cruel northern winters, maybe it would have helped to know that we could do sound poetry and cartoons and operas and origami and paintings and mess around with the spelling to add meaning.  You can hate reading and still fall in love with bpNichol.  The man wrote 10 episodes of Fraggle Rock for Pete's sake, that's got to spice up your English Lit class.

						   Okay so last week I was out and about and I was noticing all the advertisements for Tim Hortons. It apparently is "maple month" and so there are these ads every where with a maple doughnut with a bit taken out of it. Okay, so to be honest, I just realized that that 'bite' is suppose to represent half of a maple leaf. Duh, Maple Month!! Well I am a nerd and I thought that they were two little raccoon paws. Come on, it's Maple Month! Animals live in the forests that produce maple, so maple month is that good that even the raccoons are getting in on it!! And seriously, if you are Canadian because you like maple, then you are most defiently Canadian because you watched  urlLink The Raccoons.  How could you be a Canadian kid in the eighties without having watched this show!? It is next to impossible! And if you didn't watch it, then I question your patriotism.

						   I have an interview today for a position at York, editing the handbook of one of the colleges.  Hopefully that will go alright.  I did, after all, do all of the editing grunt work last year for Tyndale's Seminary handbook.  Please, York, just love me.  You know you want to.  I think the best thing about this job is that it's only 25 hours a week and it only goes until July 15th.  I know, that sounds like it should be a bad thing, but I have so many personal things that I want to sort out right now.  I would like this summer to be a bit of a break, rather than the usual system of working really hard and spending all of September recovering.  I actually have more than enough money for the summer right now, and taxes are coming soon and it's all bonus money that I don't really need, which is a startling change from a few summer ago when grocery money was scarce and rent money was a miracle.  (I would thank God, but then there's that whole deconversion thing, and isn't it interesting how that works out?)  So, what I would really like to do is to spend the whole summer in libraries, reading bpNichol poems and writing my little heart out, but you know I'll feel guilty if I don't work at all this summer.  Part-time job with lots of editing to do, here I come.  I heart editing.  It is a guilty pleasure.  Oh comma splices, I will fix you.  Do not fret, I will be there soon.  There will be a rant about bpNichol and his greatness on here very soon.  Brace yourselves for CanLit goodness.

						   I am not really a proponent for loyalties. I like something or I don't and if I like it then I LOVE it and well you get the picture. But I am not a hardcore university snob of my school is the bestest ever sort of person cause a degree is a degree, well more or less. Anyways, I really Like going to Brock a lot more than some other schools that I have attended. Anyways, I am not soo keen about the school at this precise minute as our computer access is no longer allowing us into msn messenger!! Not because they don't want to, simply because they have not upgraded the messanger they have put on!! So what exactly am I suppose to do as I wait between exams?!!? Or as I wait for the bus?! They surely don't expect me to STUDY!? Who does that!? Or worse yet read books I actually bought and NEVER read?! Sigh....Well I guess my waiting time can be spent blogging! :)  Another reason why my school is not the greatest at this moment....I AM STILL IN EXAMS!!! Boo urns!!! Well time for soc! Okay Bye!

						   So, I got the "let's just be friends" speech today.  In other news, the Damien Rice/The Frames concert was beyond incredible.  The Frames completely stole my heart, put on a solid show, much more than just an opening act.  Their drummer was incredible, the chemistry was unbelievable, their songs got so intense that everyone was just losing it and then they would kick it up a notch.  They played songs in 10/8!  You just have to love them for songs that switch from 6/8 rhythms of ONE two three FOUR five six ONE two THREE four FIVE six to 10/8 rhythms of ONE two three FOUR five six SEVEN eight NINE ten halfway through a song.  And people who used violins to rock out.  The lead singer of The Frames, Glen, told stories and was entertaining and captivating and broke into "It's a Hard Knock Life" in the bridge of one of their songs and basically, he needs to come over to my house and be that entertaining every day, because I love him.  Go to their site and listen to "What Happens When The Heart Just Stops" for an entertaining story about a dog and then a kick-ass song that starts off bittersweet and transforms into an intense yelling experience.  On to Damien.  Damien didn't talk for the first half-hour of his set at least.  He's obviously more of a moody introspective sort, and that makes for some great lyrics.  He does wonderful things like putting his guitar on the floor and playing it like bongo drums, complementing drum solos.  On the song "Be My Husband", they had the drummer playing actual bongoes, Damien sitting on the floor drumming on his guitar, the bassist playing drums with tom-toms, cello, and the chick singer.  Beautiful.  The girl who sings spends her off-time sitting cross-legged on the floor.  Both girls (the cellist is female) have this timeless beauty thing going on, the long blonde full hair pulled back simply and just classic beauty.  The vocalist girl is super-thin and stands like a model ("horrible posture," KP says) and has two voices, one low and breathy, and one high and really pure.  KP and I think that Damien really only has one or two songs, they just really long and he's had to divide them into tracks to make things work on an album.  You find echoes of his songs in the bridges or choruses of other songs.  He ended one of his songs by continuing to sing loud in full-voice, but stepping away from the mic, by half-steps, until you couldn't hear him in the mic but could hear him a bit acoustically.  When he was done his set, we gave him a standing ovation for at least ten minutes (it seemed like they might not come back!) and then they came back for another six or so songs, with the lead singer and violinist of The Frames helping out.  The whole thing just blew me away.  I was expecting them to be good, but not THAT good.  I didn't know that concerts could BE that good.  There were points where I couldn't help laughing, it was just so far beyond good that I didn't know what else to do.  Highly pleasurable.  Even moreso for KP, who has decided that the Damien Rice's drummer is hot.  Oh!  The best part about that drummer is that he had a beer bottle sitting in a roll of duct tape on a stand next to his drum set precisely so that he could do a drum solo on that stand and knock over the bottle with his drum stick in the middle of it.  That's just wonderful.

						   One of my favourite past time activities is going to one of my favourite used CD shops and discovering some good music.  urlLink The Beat Goes on  is one of my favourite stores to find some pretty wicked music. I almost never leave without something new. As was the case last night. It is always fun to browse music while listening to some wicked cool music and so last night I asked the guy what was playing and he showed me the cd, which I now  urlLink own.  I like  urlLink Willie Dixon  he's got some good stuff. Check it out. Also check out the  urlLink Wild Strawberries.  Pretty good if you like bands like the Cranberries, which I love. They pretty much are a Canadian version, but good nonetheless. Ahh man, soo much music and soo little time....and well really, soo little money. Yay for selling useless textbooks back! Okay bye!

						   Tonight I am going to see  urlLink Damien Rice  live in concert downtown.  And guess who is opening for him?   urlLink The Frames!   Two Irish bands I have recently become enraptured with!  So excited.  I'm going with my lovely roommate, because who needs boys when you have this much sauciness in one apartment?  No one, that's who.  :)  If you're not familiar with either of these bands, here are some songs you need to listen to to get started (you can hear songs by The Frames on their site, and you can download Damien Rice's from his site).  The Frames:  urlLink RAM of 'So What Happens When The Heart Just Stops' with a lovely story about a dog   urlLink RAM of 'Star, Star'   urlLink RAM of 'Lay Me Down'   Damien Rice:  urlLink mp3 of 'Volcano'   urlLink mp3 of cover of U2's 'Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' live   urlLink mp3 of 'Be My Husband' live   urlLink video of 'Woman Like A Man' live  They don't seem to have full versions of 'Cannonball' or 'Delicate' or 'Toffee Pop', but by all means, get your hands on everything you can.

						   It would be nice if I had something to blog about but I don't. I mean I could pick one of my deep thoughts (such as 'why does a round pizza come in a square box? and Why is it that people say they "slept like a baby" when babies wakeup every two hours?) and share my ramblings, but that would be boring. But what has also been boring is the fact that all day I did nothing. I didn't even leave my apartment. I think that was the first time since living here that that has happened. So that was sort of nice. The highlight of my day was making chocolate chip cookies. They are good. Anyways, the main reason I didn't doo much was because it was raining and the computer was far too distracting yesterday, but today I will be good. Now I will go and study. Okay bye!

						   Okay so it has been awhile since I have last apparently posted, wow I can't believe that it has been that long. I was trying to remember why I haven't and well i suppose it was mainly due to EXAMS. But now my 2 most difficult exams are out of the way and the 3 that are left are not that bad. So yeah I spent last week studying and then my studying was interupted by one very SAUCY Heather Ann! And we had a WONDERFUL time of fun and sauciness! And she brought ME presents! One which included a pair of very cute and pocket-sized turtles. They accompained me to Brock on Monday to my geography exam (except that I had forgotten once I got to school and so they stayed in my pocket till I got home and was cleaning out my pockets, opps!). So then what did I do after Hannie left and I finished my exams!? Well, I slept!!! Mainly because while adventures and exams were happening, I still was also WORKING, which can be very tiring. Anyways, I took the day off and slept all afternoon and watched the Royal Tenenbaums in the evening - very funny and good. So good it even invoked a semi-emotional response from me- how rare! Then today I had job training for the greenhouse and then I went to the walk-in clinic. And then I had to walk all the way to the x-ray clinic. So today I was busy too. So why the walk-in clinic?! Well because a month ago when I went snowboarding I hyper-extended my left knee and it still hurts a lot, like sends great pain down into my calf and bending and such hurts, and my knee is always stiff. So i had it checked out, so the good news is that it doesn't look like it's broken, or any ligaments have been toren, BUT it might be a tear in my cartlidge - how gross does that sound!? So I had to have an xray done and the doctor thinks that I will probably have to have my knee  urlLink scoped.  Exciting eh!? Well that in a nutshell has been my week, minus A LOT of details, but who needs those?! Okay Bye!

						    (I stole this from  urlLink Chadwick ,  urlLink Trevor ,  urlLink that  ex-  still-Coutu chick , but surprisingly, not  urlLink Holly "I've done every other one of these" Skelton .)    Spell your name with bands/singers:  Huey Piano Smith & The Clowns Everclear Arrogant Worms Tenacious D Harper, Ben Etta James R.E.M.  Aimee Mann Nina Simone Nash, Leigh  Have you ever had a song written about you?  Well,  yeah .  "Heather Ann, Heather Ann, does whatever a Heather can..."  Besides ripping off the Spiderman theme, there was a lovely arrangement of the Mission Impossible theme, sung by Janice and her three sisters (all with different parts!), where the only lyrics were "Heather Ann!"  Oh, and then there was the Pepper Ann theme song—"Heather Ann, Heather Ann, much too cool for seventh grade, Heather Ann, she's one in a millION!!"  What can I say.  My friends were bored in high school.  What song makes you cry?  Well, I am an INTJ and we never cry (right, Sanda? damn straight!) unless we are crying from laughter, but if I DID cry, it might be to something like "The Drugs Don't Work" by The Verve.  What song makes you happy?  Lots of them... for some reason my first thought was of the Finland song by Monty Python.  "You're so near to Russia, so far from Japan, quite a long way from Cairo, lots of miles from Vietnam, Finland, Finland, Finland... Finland has it all!"  What do you like to listen to before bed?  Something pretty and sad, like "Lay Me Down" by The Frames.  What color pants are you wearing right now?  I must confess a lack of pants at this precise moment.  What song are you listening to now?  The Kinks - Everybody's Gonna Be Happy  What taste is in your mouth?  I just got up.  Let's not talk about that just yet.  What's the weather like?  Clear blue skies, it's gonna be NICE today, which is perfect, because I don't have a job yet, so I can go OUTSIDE!  How are you?  Qanuinngittunga.  (I'm fine.)  Do you get motion sickness?  No, I'm the chick who can read in the car for hours and hours and hours.  Do you have a bad habit?  I drink tea in my room all the time and end up with half of our cups on my desk.  Then I blame the cat.  Do you get along with your parents?  Yes, so well.  Heh.  My parents.  They make me laugh.  Do you like to drive?  Yeah, but I wouldn't like it in Toronto, I don't think.  I never get to drive.  But I have the TTC, it gets me around.  Favorite TV show?  Alias, but I download it.  The only thing I watch on TV anymore is The West Wing, and that's for bonding time with Kathy, my addicted roommate.  Except that now I'm addicted too.  I can't help it, they are so sarcastic and witty and then I love them!  Favorite conditioner?  I have Dove right now, it's pretty swell.  Favorite video game?  DR. MARIO ALL THE WAY!!  Favorite book?  The Bible.  (Heh.)  I jest, I jest!  Don DeLillo's "White Noise" would be in my Top 5, hard to pick a favourite.  "Franny and Zooey" by J.D. Salinger, "Holy the Firm" by Annie Dillard, "High Fidelity" by Nick Hornby, "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy (which I have read, and I would marry Andrew Bolkonski in a SECOND, even though marriage scares the crap out of me—my love for him is that strong!).  Favorite magazine?  Wired/Beyond.  Would be The Believer or McSweeney's if I was cool enough.  Favorite drink?  Might be eggnog.  Heh.  Also a fan of tea, orange juice (addict!), coconut juice, mango shakes, bubble tea, coffee... Wait, is this about alcohol?  Favorite thing to do on the weekend?  Besides sleeping in?  Umm... actually seeing my friends is nice sometimes.  Oh!  Going to Chinatown and eating egg tarts with the lovely  urlLink Meredi .  That's been nice.  Favorite band/group/singer?  I love Cake more than life itself, but lately Damien Rice has been stealing my heart.  Have you broken the law?  Failure to yield at an intersection, baby.  I'm hardcore.  :)  Have you run away from home?  Yeah, but I was hoping that I would get to sleep in the play structure in the backyard and still come home for meals.  Mom wasn't too keen on that.  Have you ever gone skinny dipping?  Actually, no.  Have you ever made a prank phone call?  No, but I've actively encouraged others to do so.  Have you ever tipped over a Porta-Potty?  No.  Have you ever used your parents' credit cards?  Yes.  With their permission.  Have you ever skipped school?  Have you ever tried taking New Testament with either Olu or Stevie T?  It is impossible not to skip class after that.  Though I skipped plenty before that too.  See also: morning classes.  Have you ever fallen asleep in the shower/bath?  No.  What??  I am way too paranoid about drowning for that kind of nonsense.  Have you ever been in a school play?  I got kicked out of the seventh grade production of that musical with the song "Old Man River" or something... I don't even remember what it was.  I got kicked out for talking during rehearsal.  My teacher was a bitch.  We gave her a nervous breakdown.  Serves her right, kicking me out for talking, mutter mutter mutter.  But I was the narrator for a play in grade 1 because of my superior reading skills!!  YEAH!  Have you ever let a friend cry on your shoulder?  Of course.  Children?  I have none.  But I like them.  They taste like chicken.  Have you ever been in love?  I have no idea.  I'll go with no.  I've really really liked people, but "in love" is kind of a heavy phrase.  Have you ever had a hard time getting over someone?  Kind of.  Have you ever been hurt?  Yes.  Your greatest regret?  I don't know.  Not buying 'Boondock Saints' when I had the opportunity.  Losing my faith.  Wait, no, I don't regret that at all.  Umm...  not knowing how to talk to my grandmothers, and now they're dead and I can't.  Do you have a job?  No, but I'm working on that.  In your MP3 player right now:  Clint Mansell/Kronos Quartet - Ghosts of a Future Lost (Requiem for a Dream soundtrack)  If you were a crayon, what color would you be?  Flesh.  And I would still be white.  And I would be racist.  What makes you happy?  Bare feet, buds on trees, the St. Lawrence River, seeing people talk about the thing they love most in the world and get so excited, Sanda's "le tired", Melissa's "--||--", pretending to argue with people just because we think it's funny, teasing my Mom, having teachers tell me I rock.

						   Last night, my lovely roommate KP and I went to my old roommate Erin's place for supper.  Erin is from Texas and her roommate, Lorna, is from Northern Ireland.  Her other roommate, Jeremy, is also from Northern Ireland, but he was  urlLink up north  this week, so he doesn't count.  For supper, Erin made us  urlLink tortilla pie , so we got a little Mexican flavour in there.  She also made us Texan salsa, which tastes like Mexican salsa but more bean-y and it's puréed.  It's super-double-plus good.  KP brought  urlLink Paska , which is Easter bread, passed down from her German/we-lived-in-Russia-for-hundreds-of-years-but-only-married-Germans Mennonite family traditions.  They apparantly make like six loaves every Easter and they all give one to the pastor (so the guy ends up with billions of loaves of Paska!) and then go around giving them to friends.  I have eaten quite a bit of Paska in the last few weeks, it's a nice sweet bread with icing and sprinkles—not a bad deal, not bad at all.  Then for dessert, we had Kathy's famous  urlLink apple crisp .  Mmmm.  :)  So, we had Texan salsa, Mexican tortilla pie, German-Russian Paska, and,  urlLink according to my research  ( urlLink heh ), American apple crisp, with a Dutch-Canadian, a German-Canadian, an American, and one Irish.  Um, but we're all white chicks.  Haha.  So we're multicultural posers really, but ssh.  :)  So, I'm done exams.  Yay!  And also: nyah nyah nyah.  Heh.  I'm just kidding.  I respect all you guys who are up all night studying and up early writing exams and handing in papers and doing lab reports... really, I do.  I'll think of you when I'm dozing in my bed at 11AM.  ;)  AND... I'm off to Niagara Falls tonight to play with my friends Ness and Aaron and to see their new house, and then tomorrow I have a Conference with one Sanda Rimay!  Woohoo!  So far on the agenda:   girl-on-girl whisper-chatting (now, now, don't get any ideas, Sanda doesn't actually let people TOUCH her, don't be silly!)  throwing rocks at boys, maybe Tom the 35-year-old-who-is-really-younger-than-me   exploring a bit, maybe hiking?  or something?  what?  ALL  urlLink MANCALA  ALL THE TIME  reflecting on the sauciness inherent in our presence  New For This Conference: Heather Ann in Dresses (perhaps a limited time offer!) Also, I get to meet the generous couple who graced Sanda with food last weekend.  Yay!  I come back on Sunday, because people want to hang out with me on Sunday afternoon, and then my excellent friend Gabe is coming up on Monday to play ALL DAY LONG FOREVER AND EVER YES INDEED.  I'm excited, I haven't seen him in aeons, which is tragic but will soon be fixed.  There will be bookstores, and hippies, and maybe even tea.

						   I may not go to the most exciting church in the Niagara Region, but the people who attend there are awesome! They are so generous. I just got back from this older couple's house and they treat me so well. Jim helped me with my taxes (the purpose of the visit) and his wife made me a cassarole for lunch. Then they offered to take me to the grocery store on my way home, so I wouldn't have to make an extra trip! It meant that I again did not have to take toliet paper on the bus!!! Wow, they are soo awesome! This couple are so extraordinnairely cool, they are in their mid 60's, but honestly, they don't look like they are and they act sooo young! It is such a privilege to know them! Now, I am going to go and eat some of that cassarole!

						   So, dial up internet is still the devil.  Yesterday was my Mom's birthday, and we went hiking up by Rockport and it was beautiful out and we climbed hills near the Thousand Islands and it was so incredible to be outside and near the St. Lawrence River again.   We saw  urlLink this island  and walked under  urlLink this bridge  (although on the other side), and there were  urlLink lots of campsites  and I saw  urlLink this island , here called Jorstadt Castle, usually referred to as Singer Castle by my family, since that was what it was called the last time we visited it.  Anyways, we had fun, and the dog kept jumping into the river and got all sandy and we laughed at him a lot.  Good times were had by all, yes indeed.  I have an exam in the morning, I should stop blogging.  I had fun being at home, but it's nice to be back in Toronto.  Okay bye!

						   On Saturday I went for a walk, but instead of going the same way to the lake that I go everyday, I decided that I would try a new route. And so I did. And it was fun, I got to go to the lighthouse and climb on the rocks and check out the marina AND I found a cool little park. It overlooks the lake and the litle town of  urlLink Port Dalhousie.  Anyways, I climbed up the slope to find this park and a trail that leads along the shoreline for awhile, so I still have quite a bit to discover! What was neat was this, the park had a set of swings , which is really neat because you can swing on the swing facing the lake and so as I swung in my perch, I could see Hamilton, Burlington and Toronto and I thought, wow I know people there. So I said HI to everyone in their respective cities, though most people I know in Toronto had gone home for Easter, I still said HI. So that was my adventure on Saturday. I went home and had more adventures which were also fun, so yay for adventures. Speaking of which I need to discover why my bathroom ceiling vent is making noises that resemble that of birds or mice. Something is squeaking up there and it is not the fan!

						   I have the coolest job in the world, though it can be difficult and challenging at times, it is still the coolest job! I am a youth leader at a church and so yesterday I got paid to go and hike in the Niagara Gorge with the youth group and eat dinner at the pastor's house (where again I managed to NOT break a bed :) ). Though I feel somewhat guilty for counting times of fun as hours, but I am responsible for the kids and have to spend time getting to know them. But seriously, yesterday was sooo much fun and to get paid to do that, is awesome. Plus the day outside was soo beautiful and warm out that I managed to get a bit of tan on my arms and face!! Go sunshine!!!!

						   Okay, so it is ten after seven IN THE MORNING and not only am I up and dressed and alert, it is super-light outside.  I am up this early and I even missed the sunrise!  So this is that crazy morning nonsense I've heard so much about.  I thought the entire world got up around ten or so, just like me when I get up 'early.'  So, I'm going home (on the BUS) for the Easter/Heather-Ann's-Mom's-Birthday weekend, and it will be good and I will get to see the RIVER and a BOY (not at home, let's not be silly -- but travel companionship is a good deal indeed) and my MOM and my DAD and I will see my SAUCY MIDDLE SISTER and my YOUNGEST SISTER and her BOYFRIEND WHOM I HAVE NOT YET MET and my PUPPY.  And I will celebrate the rising of Christ by not rising until at least noon, then eating chocolate shaped like symbols of ancient fertility rites.  And we will go traipsing about in the woods and it will be a good deal all around and we will have fun and I will be back to the blogging world on Tuesday or so.  Because I have an exam on Wednesday.  Boo-urns, that is all I have to say about that.  Okay bye!

						   I have been thinking about prayer a lot lately.  Perhaps not everyone who reads this blog knows this yet, but I'm not a Christian anymore, and I have spent a lot of time over the last six months trying to sort out the ramifications of that change.  I have tried to stay away from such topics on this blog, partially because I am never sure who drops in here, partially out of respect for my youth-pastor co-blogger Sanda, and partially because it is a private process.  But, I have been getting flak from certain  urlLink people  for not blogging lately, so I might as well talk a bit about my recent thoughts.  I don't remember when I started praying.  It was ingrained into me from a very early age.  The church I grew up in always stressed prayer as conversation with God, something to be engaged in at pretty much every point in the day, but also as something that can be approached with formality, sometimes accompanied by fasting or seclusion.  I never had an imaginary friend when I was little.  I suppose Jesus filled that role for me, and since I believed that he was real, I probably kept the imaginary-friend aspect.  He was the confidante, the one who understood me best, the one I could count on not to leave, the one I trusted to listen as long as I needed him to.  For a while, I really believed that God had a specific plan for my life and that I should probably figure out what it was if I wanted to get anywhere.  However, for all the times that I was told to "listen to God," no one seemed to have any practical advice on how to do that.  They told me to read the Bible, to spend time in prayer, to 'seek God' (another undefined term), and to 'listen for his voice.'  For a time, I really believed that I could hear God's voice.  Not audibly, more like listening to myself think, but hearing him in my head instead.  After having made some decisions based on that voice that led to some rather painful experiences, I concluded that I was not hearing God correctly, because I believed that God was Good, and that he would not have led me into something that was so obviously bad.  Needless to say, such experiences cast doubt on the whole process of prayer for me.  I spent about two years unable to pray, but desperately wanting to pray.  I could not.  I was left speechless.  I did not know what to say.  I had trusted and I had been wrong, and how could I be sure whether I was hearing God ever again?  What if I had heard correctly and he had steered me wrong?  Was he malevolent towards me?  Was I like Esau, Jacob's twin who God hated while he was yet in the womb?  Had God hardened my heart?  Was this my fault?  I regained my ability to pray for a while towards the end of my first year of bible college.  I am not sure why, perhaps I laid my doubts aside as I began to trust people there.  Maybe I got caught up in the music.  I think a lot of it had to do with my relationships with people there; as I grew to respect them and see how passionate their faith was, I gained some confidence to jump back in, hoping not to get hurt again.  Deep down, I feared that I would not be able to reconnect with God, that I had asked too many questions and I was on my way out of the faith already.  But, for a summer, I seemed to be able to patch together a half-decent relationship with God.  Then Tyndale happened.  I should probably put a disclaimer here and say that it's a fine institution and had nothing to do with me losing my faith.  However, my year there was one of growing doubt and increasing dissatisfaction with my life.  I did not fit there, not in any way.  I felt alienated.  I hated much of my time there, it was not for me.  In the midst of that dissatisfaction, God disappeared.  My questions, on the other hand, showed up with a vengeance.  Suddenly the Bible was fraught with complications.  Over the summer after my year at Tyndale, I did a lot of research, and a lot of questioning, and a lot of shouting and arguing.  By my second month at York, I was ready to say that I was no longer a Christian.  Six months later, I still absent-mindedly start to pray, only to stop mid-sentence.  Imaginary friends are hard to let go of sometimes.  Deities are even harder.

						   Today I got my political science essay back, the one on Canadian peacekeepers. Amongst my many, many sources there was one article from a  urlLink Macleans.  Anyways, apparently in university this conservative magazine is not credible enough. So my T.A. allowed it this time...but recommened I use some more reliable sources.

						   Today I have done nothing. No children showed up for sunday school, so I didn't have to teach. Church finished early, so I came home early. I went to the store to get cat food and some other things, but if i didn't get cat food, my cat was going to do some damage. I had a 2 hour nap. I've listened to music and hung out on msn. I went for a walk. I made chocolate chip banana muffins. That's it. Well I did dishes too. I can't believe how lazy I have been. But it is sort of nice, considering how crazy busy I have been in the last oh let's say 3 months!!!  In other news.... Amanda moved home yesterday. It is truly sad and very quiet around here. Not that she or her cat are really loud, but it is different. So the apartment is quite empty. I've never lived on my own before, like completely all by myself! I am such a big girl now!! But yeah, it is going to be a learning experience for sure and I think over all that it will be fun!  You should check out this band,  urlLink Yellowcard.  I like them, I like their song, View From Heaven and Ocean Avenue.   Okay back to my tea and freshly made chco. chip 'Nanna muffin!! mmmmmm

						   4 years ago I did a one year program and it was fun and good times were had by most. I have stayed in touch with those I have wanted too, and for the others I have stayed in contact with. Now I sometimes get updates from these classmates of mine, and indeed the other day I did.   The content of this email however, was hmmm interesting. Not interesting in the sense of 'wow! look at what they are doing etc'. It is wow, what the heck was the point of that email?! Basically it said; Hey everyone I know it has been a while since I talked to you all (in my case, it has been at least 2 years since we have talked). And then she went on to say that she has met a guy and they are not dating but just friends. BUT if marriage comes up they will think about it. That was it. That was the whole email. Like honestly, do I care!? Not really. And seriously, if you are 'just friends' then why bring up marriage!? I don't get it.  Anyways, I want to send a tongue in cheek response about something trivial in my life. Like maybe I met a boy and we have become laundry buddies because we do our laundry together. Or maybe how I met a boy in seminar and now we met and discuss politics with such passion that if it comes up we might have a political career together. Or maybe I will just say something about the weather or the blue jays. Or that in the mornings I wake up and think, I need to go to the washroom. I could mention the fact that I am going to get married on such and such a day, now all I need is the groom! Oh the possibilities are endless!

						   So, my mom's birthday is coming up, and I'm going to make her a CD.  She likes "black" music.  Please understand that my mom has lived in rural Nova Scotia and Ontario all of her life and is not racist, but sometimes thinks it's politically correct to refer to black people as "colored people".  And all Asians are Chinese by default.  ANYWAYS.  So, "black" music is (from what I understand) soul, jazz, blues, that sort of thing.  By black people.  Like Aretha Franklin and Etta James.  But I have a limited knowledge of such music, so my line up is quite short at the moment.  Potential songs so far are:   Aretha Franklin - Respect  the Sister Act version of Oh Happy Day  Aretha Franklin - Natural Woman  Etta James - At Last  The Shirelles - I Will Follow Him  The Temptations - Ain't No Mountain High Enough  The Supremes - Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You  John Prine, Johnny Cash, AND Bob Dylan singing You Are My Sunshine (she likes the song, okay?)   There must be universally known songs that fit this category that I am just not thinking of.  I will probably end up putting some James Brown on there, too.  72 minutes is a lot of time to fill sometimes.  I did discover the song "Laid" by James (not James Brown, just 'James') and it's super.  But songs that mention messing around with gender roles do not fit on my Mom's birthday CD somehow.

						   I had a really good weekend. I didn't work crazy hours, in fact I was done on Saturday by 2:30pm. My sister came down and we hung out and had a lot of fun. And then on Sunday after church we had an Old SPEW get together and we went  urlLink here  and had lots of fun-in typical SPEW fashion.  When I first went to college there was a girl in my program who made me feel like I was in grade 9 again. I had come from an awesome one year program that really built me up as a person and then I went to college and this girl totally made me doubt who I was and made me feel so little. Then I realized that she was not as wonderful as she seemed and is indeed not the brightest crayon in the box at all! But the thing is, she is getting married!! I know she is pretty and deep inside she is a nice person, but I don't understand! She is crazy and is not a person with much substance! (not to be too mean, but seriously this girl is as deep as a puddle in the Saharra.)And today for me has been one of those days where I have been frustrated with myself in the sense that I seem to have this hope that maybe one day I will find someone who will love me and want to grow old with me, even though there has been NO indication of ever finding such a person. And I find myself getting really bitter about it sometimes. I want to believe that I am a person worthy of being loved. I think I am smart, funny and pretty...I think I would be a great catch! But why can't any boys seem to think that as well? Why do I even bother finding nice boys? It seems everytime that I put out some effort it ends up being a waste of time. I don't believe that there is true love in the fairy tale sense. But I do think that there is someone out there that would get a long perfectly with me. Am I being too idealistic? Are my standards too high? I have no answers and I just find myself getting more and more frustrated to the point where I don't even want to bother with having hope because I will just get crushed in the end.  Maybe I wouldn't feel this way if I had some experience behind me. I don't feel that I have missd out entirely, I just feel neglected and unworthy. And maybe I wouldn't feel so bitter if I had more positive examples of relationships in my life. But when you don't see many happy endings, where is the encouragement that things might work out better for you? Maybe I am just being bitter....and maybe I am just afaraid of taking a risk, but once bitten twice shy. Or maybe I am not any of the things I think I am, and maybe to everyone else I am the epitome of everything that is not desirable.

						   My Uncle Herman died this morning.   urlLink Newspaper report about it here.   They found his car in the river...  Wow... just wow.  I... yeah.  I don't know what to say.  He was a good man.  When I was little, he was an usher in my church and he would always offer me a bulletin and then refuse to let go of it when I tried to take it.  He would look down at me and say, with a sparkle in his eye, "They're a dollar, you know."  It seems that our entire family has a sense of humour that includes the frustration of small children.  I do have some words for people who think that suicide = hell.  A lot of four-letter words.  Good god, people go through bad times and dark days.  All of us do.  Should a person be judged because their darkest day happened to be their last?  I would hope that a "good" God would have a bit more mercy and balance than that.  If Christianity is right and God is just, then my uncle is in heaven, because he spent his life devoted to that God, regardless of any moment of weakness in the end.  Sometimes depression is overwhelming and things turn upside down and I can't have anything but sympathy for that.  I can't imagine what this morning would have felt like for him, what it would have taken to drive him to this point, how awful that must have felt.  I would hope that whatever deity you serve would be at least as empathetic as I am.

						   I have two questions, and this is what they are:  1. I've known a lot of girls, and a lot of them have been quite upset at the sight of blood.  Some of them run away at the sight of a mere [bleeding] scratch on an arm, and don't even get me started on the pranks that can be pulled with plastic spiders in residence.  I don't understand either of these fears (spiders or blood), but I  especially  don't understand the blood fear.  Why is that?  Because 99% of these girls spend 25% of their time bleeding profusely.  And menstrual blood is certainly more disgusting than any other kind of blood, despite the fact that some women are a crazy version of feminist and  urlLink make paintings with menstrual blood  in order to celebrate the female cycle.  The rest of us just gripe about it and gorge ourselves on chocolate and/or salt for a week.  Why do I think it's more disgusting?  Well, it's thicker and smells worse.  So, my theory is that women should not be fazed at all by just regular old blood coming from someone's arm or something.  You bunch of pussies.  (Oh wait... that was my point, wasn't it?)  (I'm in Linguistics, I get to play with words, stop being so offended.)  2. Boys.  You have an unnatural fear of menstruation.  Not that any of you have gotten this far because you got freaked out and closed your browser halfway through the first question of this post.  Why can't you be more like Dave Foley of Kids in the Hall?  He has a  urlLink good attitude towards menstruation !  And you all want to be Dave Foley, don't you?  Seriously now, what's the big deal?  You're supposed to be big and strong and brave in the face of danger and not freaked out by flesh wounds and this isn't even abnormal, it happens a full quarter of the time for one half of our species!  We have to put up with you guys  urlLink joking around about penises  (scroll down to "Need a Cheer Up?", as Caleb's permanent links aren't working for me) all the time, and then you run away when we mention the fact that our uteruses are bleeding?  *sigh*

						   I know it has been awhile. I have been a little busy, still am actually. I really don't have anything exciting to blog about. Encounter was awesome! It was such a fun time! Work has been okay, and youth has been good but it has all left me very, very tired and my patience is running thin. I was very grumpy at work today and I had to work very hard to have a good attitude and to try and think with a Christ-like attitude. I am excited for tonight because my sisters are coming to play so that will be a lot of fun. I am also sending my cat home to my parents because I will be at camp for the summer and my cat is driving me nuts right now, so I think the timing has worked out perfectly! Okay bye!

						   Today I had lunch with one of my coworkers and she was telling me about how she grew up in Manila, Philippines, and did her first degree in Israel.  She speaks Filipino, English, and Hebrew, and perhaps some other languages that she didn't tell me about.  Her father is Jewish, her mother is Catholic, her boyfriend is Muslim ("we are a United Nations family!").  Now she lives in Toronto and says that it is startlingly safe compared to Manila, where there is a large degree of poverty, rape, kidnapping for ransom, and violence.  She told me that when she was in high school, she was not allowed to drive alone at night for fear that someone would pretend to be hit on the road in order to stop her car and kidnap her.  She's never lived in a small town, so I was able to relate some of my thoughts about moving from a town of 300 to a sprawling city of millions.  Later, I was talking to another of my coworkers who grew up in Nairobi, and is from the same tribe (Kikuyu) as a couple of my friends from Tyndale (you know they're Kikuyu if the name 'Mwangi' shows up anywhere in their name!).  She told me about how her father grew up outside of the city, and her mother was city-born, so their language was quite different, though still both Kikuyu.  She also told me about English-based and Swahili-based slang, which is what most Kenyans speak on a regular basis, but it is not used in much writing, so it changes very quickly.  She said that when she went back after five years, her friends laughed at her a lot because her language was so out of date, and she said that she had noticed the language change already by the time she came back to Canada nine months later.  My boss is Australian.  Another of the girls I work with is also Filipino.  Practically everyone on my bus is Asian, but as I get closer to York, suddenly the bus fills up with brown people.  Before I came here, I remember people going on about how multicultural Canada is, and I never really thought they were serious.  I mean, practically everyone at home is white, and by white, I mean Dutch.  (I'm half-kidding.)  There was one black guy in my high school, and one Chinese girl.  There was one Korean guy at EBC when I went there, and a couple of black people, but they were all from Nigeria, not Canadian.  Now I'm in a city that is  actually  multicultural and it makes me happy.

						   I'm working on a new section for  urlLink my website  about my journey away from Christianity.  Not sure when exactly it'll be ready to be linked to, but here's what I'm wondering and would like comments on:  how much should we value privacy, especially in a medium like the internet?  Is it dangerous somehow to share our most personal thoughts?  Dave Eggers doesn't think so.  In his first book,  A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius , there is this passage about how brutally honest he is being without fearing consequences:    Heh. Heh. Heh. Are you sure you want to be telling me all this?  All what?   About your parents, the paranoia...  What am I giving you?  I am giving you nothing.  I am giving you things that God knows, everyone knows.  They are famous in their deaths.  This will be my memorial to them.  I give you all these things, I tell you about his legs and her wigs&#151;I do so later in this section&#151;and relate my wondering if I should be having sex with my girlfriend in front of their closet the night of my father's service, but after all that, what, in the end, have I given you?  It seems like you know something, but you still know nothing.  I tell you and it evaporates.  I don't care&#151;how could I care?  I tell you how many people I have slept with (thirty-two), or how my parents left this world, and what have I really given you?  Nothing.  I can tell you the names of my friends, their phone numbers, but what do you have?  You have nothing.  They all granted permission.  Why is that?  Because you have nothing, you have some phone numbers.  It seems precious for one, two seconds.  You have what I can afford to give.  You are a panhandler, begging for anything, and I am the man walking briskly by, tossing a quarter or so into your paper cup.  I can afford to give you this.  This does not break me.  I give you virtually everything I have.  I give you all of the best things I have, and while these things are things that I like, memories that I treasure, good or bad, like the pictures of my family on my walls I can show them to you without diminishing them.  I can afford to give you everything.  We gasp at the wretches on afternoon shows who reveal their hideous secrets in front of millions of similarly wretched viewers, and yet....what have we taken from them, what have they given us?  Nothing.  We know that Janine had sex with her daughter's boyfriend, but...then what?  We will die and we will have protected...what?  Protected from all the world that, what, we do this or that, that our arms have made these movements and our mouths these sounds?  Please.  We feel that to reveal embarassing or private things, like, say, masturbatory habits (for me, about once a day, usually in the shower), we have given someone something, that, like a primitive person fearing that a photographer will steal his soul, we identify our secrets, our pasts and their blotches, with our identity, that revealing our habits or losses or deeds somehow makes one less of oneself.  But it's just the opposite, more is more is more&#151;more bleeding, more giving.  These things, details, stories, whatever, are like the skin shed by snakes, who leave theirs for anyone to see.  What does he care where it is, who sees it, this snake, and his skin?  He leaves it where he molts.  Hours, days or months later, we come across a snake's long-shed skin and we know something of the snake, we know that it's of this approximate girth and that approximate length, but we know very little else.  Do we know where the snake is now?  What the snake is thinking now?  No.  By now the snake could be wearing fur; the snake could be selling pencils in Hanoi.  The skin is no longer his, he wore it because it grew from him, but then it dried and slipped off and he and everyone could look at it.   And you're the snake?  Sure.  I'm the snake.  So, should the snake bring it with him, this skin, should he tuck it under his arm?  Should he?   No?  No, of course not!  He's got no fucking arms!  How the fuck would a snake carry a skin?  Please.  But like the snake, I have no arms&#151;metaphorically speaking&#151;to carry these things with.  Besides, these things aren't even mine.  None of this is mine.  My father is not mine&#151;not in that way.  His death and what he's done are not mine.  Nor are my upbringing nor my town nor its tragedies.  How can these things be mine?  Holding me responsible for keeping hidden this information is ridiculous.  I was born into a town and a family and the town and my family happened to me.  I own none of it.  It is everyone's.  It is shareware.  I like it, I like having been a part of it, I would kill or die to protect those who are part of it, but I do not claim exclusivity.  Have it.  Take it from me.  Do what you will.  Make it useful.  This is like making electricity from dirt; it is almost too good to be believed, that we can make beauty from this stuff.   But what about privacy?  Cheap, overabundant, easily gotten, lost, regained, bought, sold.   But what about exploitation?  Exhibitionism?  Are you Catholic?   No.  Then why are you talking about exhibitionism?  It's a ridiculous term.  Someone wants to celebrate their existence and you call it exhibitionism.  It's niggardly.  If you don't want anyone to know about your existence, you might as well kill yourself.  You're taking up space, air.   What about dignity?  You will die, and when you die, you will know a profound lack of it.  It's never dignified, always brutal.  What's dignified about dying?  It's never dignified.  And in obscurity?  Offensive.  Dignity is an affectation, cute but eccentric, like learning French or collecting scarves.  And it's fleeting and incredibly mercurial.  And subjective.  So fuck it.   So?  Qu'est-ce que vous pensez?

						    urlLink    I find this terribly funny.  Does that make me a bad person?  I do know a guy with OCD, but he's got it pretty much under control.   urlLink Mimi Smartypants  also has OCD tendencies, which she used to talk about more before she got a book deal and people started stalking her.  (Click on image to go to the Toothpaste for Dinner site and see other funny graphics.  Then buy me a t-shirt from there, preferably the "If I had a dollar for every time I had sixty cents, I would be Canada" one.)

						   So last night I had a friend over and we hung out till about 11:20ish when we both realized it is getting late and that we both have early mornings. My friend left but a few moments he was back because someone had blocked his car in and he could not get out.  Step one - call the landlord and see what can be done. Advice - honk your horn till someone comes and make sure the next time you park in visitor parking and not someone's spot. May I point out we have maybe 7 spots at the most for visitor parking and none of them are clearly identifible.  Not liking to be noise makers at such an hour we contemplate what we can do. Perhaps we should just start knocking on other people's doors. Wait no- a better idea! Let's call a friend with a hitch on his car and just tow the car out of the way. Perfect! Eventually the roommate (who I had not met till last night) of my friend arrived and we tow the car. As we are pulling the vehicles owner comes out and is not impressed with us. He starts yelling and swearing at us, moves his car back in front of my friend's and then goes inside to call the police. However, my 'neighbour' has left his car door unlock so we decide to try to physicall move it by taking of the e-brake and moving it since it was already in neutral. Done. My friend again tries to leave but my 'neighbour' is also fast and is trying to pull his car to block again and then uses his body as a way to block.  So we decide to wait for the police. We tried to reason with him and explain our side but it could not be done. I zip inside to make a phone call myself because I wanted to find out what MY options were and to see if there was any legitimacy in my 'neighbour's cries of the cops are coming and I am going to press charges. By the time I got back from a fruitless phone call the police were already there and everything was being dealt with. No charges were pressed that I know of and we were all let off with a warning, and a lesson learned speech. The cops sent my friend(s) home and then it ended with me shaking my neighbours hand and us intorducing ourselves, though it wasn't quite a pleasant situation. Maybe he was just nicer to me because things were cleared up and I was a girl.  Lesson: I don't even know- because it seems everytime I go out with this one friend something quite adventurous happens. And really does it take that much to park your car elsewhere-even if you DO pay for the spot- is worth being such an unpleasant person for it?   Well what a way to start my weekend! I am leaving tonight for a youth retreat that takes place urlLink where the movie Meatballs was filmed.   It is called  urlLink Encounter  and I run all the Wreckcreation stuff. It is a retreat that gets about 200ish people and it is the last year for it. (Hmm, that would be a good rant for this blog- baptists and their politics!) Anyways, it is still going to be an awesome weekend and I am very much looking forward to it-many more adventures to come! Let us hope that they do not include the men in blue!

						   I realise I've done this before, but I felt like posting and 30 songs might show my musical tastes a bit more accurately.

Man on the Moon - Andy Kaufman (instrumental) 3. Our Lady Peace - Hello Oskar 4. Nancy Wilson - Gee Baby, Ain't I Good To You 5. SNL (Tenacious D?) - I'm the Only Gay Eskimo 6. Jack Johnson - Drink the Water 7. Marcy Playground - Ancient Walls of Flowers 8. The Unicorns - 52 Favourite Things 9. Jeff Buckley - Morning Theft 10. Ben Harper - Welcome to the Cruel World 11. Travis - The Line is Fine 12. Bright Eyes - Haligh, Haligh, a lie, Haligh 13. Ween - Mutilated Lips 14. Polyphonic Spree - Section 7 (Hanging Around the Day Part 2) 15. Cake - Pretty Pink Ribbon 16. MxPx - Move to Bremerton 17. Sloan - Deeper Than Beauty 18. Arrogant Worms - We are the Beaver 19. Rolling Stones - Satisfaction 20. Ben Folds - Annie Waits 21. Monty Python - I Like Chinese 22. Badly Drawn Boy - Once Around the Block 23. Wayne Newton - Danke Schöen 24. Caedmon's Call - Forget What You Know 25. Moxy Früvous - Boo Time 26. Damien Rice - Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For 27. Lou Reed - Satellite of Love 28. Weezer - Across the Sea 29. Liz Phair - Explain It To Me 30. My Bloody Valentine - Sometimes   Favourite lyrics out of that set would probably have to be from Liz Phair's  Explain It To Me :   Head underwater/Keeps getting harder/Give 'em your medicine/Fame injection/Tell him to jump higher/Tell him to run farther/Make him measure up/Decades longer than you/Piece it together/It's like weather/Watch him travel/Kiss the gravel/Tell him to jump higher/Tell him to run farther/Make him measure up/Ten times longer than you ever should/You never could explain them to me/Explain them to me

						   If I have ONE more person email me or message me or call me and allude to something they read on this blog, when I didn't even know they KNEW about this blog, nor did I authorize them to read it, I swear to God I'm going to ... no, I'm kidding, I love you guys.  Really, I do.  It's just a bit odd to have random people refer to it when I pretty much just write for two people -- Sanda and Mike.  I'm sorry, but it's true.  For Sanda, because she's the sauciest co-blogger EVER, and for Mike because I like to make fun of him.  Wait, that goes for Sanda too.  Plus she's the only girl to ever let me away with calling her a baby cow for over a year now.  She gets bonus points for that, for sure.  We're over 1100 hits now (unique, not reloads), after only 54 days, so that's pretty cool.  I like the new Blogger.  I know that  urlLink some people  have been less enthusiastic, but I give it a thumbs up.  I like the profile goodness, and for some reason I like the rounded corners, although that is  urlLink so 90s .  Despite the goods to be plundered,  urlLink I'm not going to swap my Gmail account .  Mine all mine!!! [heatherannATgmailDOTcom, send me something funny and I'll return the favour, I promise]  Today I was reading in my now-overdue library book,  The Non-Existence of God  by Nicholas Everitt, about how a creator could neither be temporal nor timeless.  Theologians like to fight about whether God is eternal in the sense that he has always been here and always will be here, that he has an infinite past, a present, and an infinite future, or whether he's not in time at all, whether he is eternal because he has no past, present, nor future, yet exists.  The thing is, in order to be a cause for something (like, the universe), one has to be either before it or simultaneous to it.  A preceding cause would be something like me slapping you, causing you pain -- the slap comes first and then the pain.  The most famous example of a simultaneous cause would be that of a bowling ball causing a depression in a pillow -- the depression is caused by the bowling ball, but its effect occurs while the ball is there, not after it.  Anyways, if God were in time and caused the universe, he would have to be either a) before creation, or b) simultaneous to creation.  It is impossible to be "before creation," because time is part of creation, and you can't be before the first thing.  So, if God is temporal, he must be simultaneous to creation.  This runs us into trouble because then it's not clear whether God or the universe is the cause of the other one.  Maybe the universe created God.  It's unclear.  We know in the bowling ball example that the depression in the pillow did not cause the bowling ball because bowling balls occur naturally without pillows, but bowling-ball-shaped depressions in pillows don't occur naturally without bowling balls.  We have a way to test that.  We don't have a way to test the relationship between God and the universe, it's impossible to isolate.  On the other hand, maybe God is timeless or "outside time," just as he has no width or height.  This still leaves him unable to create the universe.  Why?  Well, causes have to be before or simultaneous to their effects.  A timeless being is neither before nor simultaneous to anything.  The thing about being outside of time is that that particular god wouldn't be able to change (immutability) nor act.    Now, that seems to be a pretty good argument, though I've condensed it from memory and maybe mangled it a bit in the process.  Why wasn't I taught this in my oh-so-expensive bible college philosophy courses where we were supposed to be building defences against the evil atheists?  Maybe I got ripped off.  Instead they told me the main theistic arguments and gave me no clue as to what the atheistic philosopher would reject about them.  Instead I felt trepidation when looking at non-Christian philosophy books or websites.  Isn't the best offence a good defence?  Isn't the key to a good philosophical defence the knowledge of what the other team is going to throw at you?  If there's anything I've decided this year, it's that research is of ultimate importance.   Proverbs 18:17 (NIV) "The first to present his case seems right, till another comes forward and questions him."

						    urlLink Browallia  is a beautiful plant and it is one of my favourites at the greenhouse because it is very easy to deal with. You just unhook it, sleeve it and tag it and it is ready to be put on the rack. Unlike the geraniums and the non-stops which take constant cleaning!! Anyways, the only bad thing about this wonderful plant is that I am allergic to it!! MY entire forearm is red, bumpy and itchy!! Just plain gross! This is my first allergy EVER! I have never reacted to anything before! And it sucks cause it is driving me nuts!!  It also sucks because I have been the talk of the greenhouse today. Have you seen that girls rash!? People have been stopping me in the halls wanting to see it. I even had to fill out and 'incident report' about it. Thankfully it is not spreading! But boy is it itchy!!!

						   So, I haven't posted since Thursday, because I was  urlLink with Meredith  for the entire weekend.  I was supposed to go to a Rheostatics concert with her and crash at her place and then go home, but in the morning we decided to get falafel and make funky  urlLink marble magnets  and then we had to go all over Toronto to find supplies for that, so we walked and walked and walked and then we walked some more, and MerE "accidentally" shoplifted some markers and then she gasped and ran back and paid for them, and then we walked some more.  Note: Canadian Tire does not sell magnets, even though some of the clerks will assure you that they're in Aisle 23.  They're not.  Who knows why, but they don't have them.  Then we cut out fun pictures from Wired and Adbusters and Bitch and Bust and Glamour (quite a combo, but MerE pulls it off), and made our magnets.  Then it was late so I crashed at her place YET AGAIN and I was going to come home again in the morning, but then we decided to go shopping, and we had the Best Bruschetta Bread Ever (honestly -- wow) and we went to Romni's to buy stiff yarn that doesn't retain heat and isn't so floppy so that I can make a summer hat and MerE decided to learn to crochet, so we got her fun wool and a crochet hook and then we walked and walked and walked.  We were going to go see '13 Going On 30' because who doesn't love Jennifer Garner acting like a 13-year-old?  But then it was $14 and that's just crazy.  So we rented 'Playing By Heart,' and it was lovely and popcorn was consumed and crocheting was learned and THEN, FINALLY, I tore myself away because I need to sleep and then go to work tomorrow.  Every once in a while, it seems that I meet people that I just click with, and it's very easy to hang out with them.  MerE is like that for me.  We "met" online about 6 years back, and started hanging out last fall, and it's always a blast.  We rant and rave about things and talk seriously about religion and design and boys and life and insecurity and feminism, and then we make fun of people and make crafts, and sometimes she burns popcorn but not very badly so it's okay, and it's just very comfortable.  Sometimes it's hard work to hang out with people, but sometimes it just works ( ça marche ), and you don't have to worry when things get quiet or when you interrupt each other or when you tell someone that Value Village is just a little bit farther down the road but really you've gotten the location horribly horribly wrong and you've been walking for twenty minutes for NO REASON AT ALL.  Not that I did that today.  Of course not.  :)  ANYWAYS.  Yay for  urlLink Meredi !

						   I work with a bunch of people whose first language is not English. One of the guys on my team is from Columbia and his name is Luis. It is pronounced like Lousie. Today while we were doing our work I bashed a bunch of the baskets off the rack and excalimed loudly, "Geez Lousie!!!". To which Luis looked at me in with great panic in his eyes (for he had just put a bunch of baskets on the same rack I bashed mine off of) and asked me what the problem was. I with a bewildered look on my face, asked Luis what problem?! Luis was like, "Sanda, you said my name..." to which the whole team laughed and then we had to try to explain that I was saying Lousie and not Luis! Geez Louise!!

						   Last night, I had a dream in which I attended  Fight Club: The Musical .  It featured random people from my past in a dancing troupe (one guy from high school, one guy from preschool whose name I've been trying to remember all day) and the plant from Little Shop of Horrors.  Someone needs to analyze that one for me.  Get to it, oh commentors of this here blog.  :)

						   Let's get one thing straight, Mr. Not To Be Named On This Blog.  If you lead me on for a while only to give me the "let's just be friends/it's not you, it's me" speech two short months into it, there are certain things that you can't do.  You can't all of a sudden have all the time in the world to talk to me, when you ignored me for the two weeks before giving me The Speech.  That just confirms my suspicions that you were avoiding me.  You can't ask me how my week is going, when you know better than anyone else that it started with you giving me "the words that all men are taught to fear" according to The Waiting.  You can't pretend we're best buddies right away.  If I'm going to play along with the "let's be friends" spiel, then it's going to be the  next  week, certainly not the next day.  You can't call me in the middle of the day just to see what's up.  You can't end MSN chats with the flower emoticon.  You can't call me 'babe.'  In fact, you probably shouldn't have done that in the first place, only my mom gets to do that.  You can't ask me if I want you to buy me anything when you go to France.  You can't flirt with me.  There was a window of opportunity, and you were the one who closed it.  Sorry, but that's the way it is and it's not my fault.  It is my fault, though, if I don't shut that window on your hand if you try to open it again.

						   For the last few weeks, there have been ads on the subway for the  urlLink New You Show 2004 .  Take a second to click that link and check out their logo.  It's the face of an older woman with an inset face of a younger woman -- to emphasize that they can make you look younger, right?  Take a second look.  The older woman is Asian, the younger woman is Caucasian.  How creepy is that?  The whole emphasis on anti-aging procedures is sick in and of itself.  Our society is so afraid of death, we don't even let ourselves get wrinkles.  Personally, I think people look scary when they are in their sixties and look like they've never smiled a day in their life.  Women in their forties shouldn't look like they're in their twenties; there is nothing wrong with being an adult, there is another level of beauty when it's mixed with the wisdom and experience that comes with age.  That's a type of beauty I don't have a chance at conveying with my 23 year old body.  I do understand the fear of aging though, to an extent.  The fear of death is a natural one.  But this emphasis on appearing Caucasian is ridiculous.  I read a while ago about  urlLink Asians going through cosmetic surgery to look Caucasian  (more photos in the links in the left-hand column) and it just seems so wrong.  Useless, and sad, and I want to punch the doctors who make money from people's insecuries.  This is just racism in a clever plastic disguise.  This is millions of people convinced that they would have more worth if they just didn't look so Asian, which is not true!  In a similar vein, I'm sick of people telling me to get a tan.  I'm sick of people saying "you're SO white!! look at your legs!!"  Well, yeah.  100% Dutch, that's my heritage, and I work inside.  I'm not going to spend money on dying my skin a different colour or sitting in a tanning bed that will probably burn me and eventually give me cancer, and I'm not going to spend time out in the sun solely for the purpose of getting a tan, because you know what?  I don't care.  I think I look fine.  I look white because I   am   white.  The Asian people in my neighbourhood shouldn't be jealous of the shape of my eyes, and I shouldn't be jealous of the colour of my black and brown neighbours.  I see hundreds of people on public transit every week, and I have noticed that women of different races are beautiful in quite different ways, but damn.  Women have it going on.  I'm sorry, boys, but whether it's because we have more pressure to look nice or because we're just a more pleasing shape, statistically there are many more attractive women than men, regardless of race.  I'm just sick of being told that we're worth more if we're dressed up, if we have perfect eyebrows, if we don't have any body fat at all, and now if we're the right race (or combination of races, really).  I'm also sick of feeling guilty for having a lot of those things "right" -- for being tall and thin and white and having clear skin -- because I haven't worked for it at all, it was just the luck of the draw.  But screw it, I'm not going to apologize to any more of my female friends who quite literally work their asses off to get to a body weight that I achieve by sitting in front of my computer all day.  Forget it.  It's not my fault, but I'm not apologizing anymore, I'm just going to wear skirts and enjoy it.  So there.

						   Okay since I have been at work I have had to explain my name at least twice a day. So I thought since Hannie gave a little intro on who I am, I would add to that a bit, but make it about my name, cause I am sure all of you who read our blog and don't know me have been reading SAND-A. Well people, it is true that my name is spelt like sand with an a, but that's not how you say it. Indeed, the most common misspelling of my name is Sonda because that is how you say it. I have also seen people spell it Saunda (which is okay with me, cause it looks cool). My favourite misprounounciation of my name was someone despartley trying to remember it, and was like, "Oh I remember, it's, it's SUDAN!" Nice try, but no.  So where did my parents find such an odd name?! Well it is apparently a common name in Croatia, which is a small country across from Italy in Eastern Europe and that is where my dad is from. Being the eldest kid, my dad wanted his first born to have a Croatian name. My name was the only one my parents could agree on. If you know anything about the Slavic language it is a very harsh one so I am very lucky to not be called Dragistza or anything of the like. I am also named after my dad's aunt, my great-aunt, but for no real reason. Though she apparently had a bit of a shady past (she married the priest of her village!! oh no! the scandal!!) So maybe being named after someone does have significance...hehe....  So what does Sanda mean? Well it is dervived from Alexandra which is a Greek name and means Helper of mankind. Xander, Sandy, and Sandra are all considered short forms of that name.   Having an odd name has lead me to procrastinate in researching about it, and I have learned that it is a common name in Burma, I am a  urlLink business,  I am also a  urlLink city  in Japan, my personal favourite is  urlLink this one.  I am also an  urlLink island off the coast of Scotland.  So really my name isn't really all that uncommon.   So if you are having trouble remembering how to say my name, my friend Wanda and I came up with this little saying, it's like Wanda but with an S. And no that doesn't make Swanda.

						   Today I bought skirts -- four of them in fact.  I also bought a few nice shirts so that I have something presentable for work.  (Note: I got the  urlLink job .)  This is a new thing for me, dressing in girl-clothing.  I've always been a pants kind of girl.  Casual pants, usually.  My favourite pants are my XL Modrobes which are a startlingly bright shade of blue.  Lately, however, I have been buying dresses and skirts and (gasp!) enjoying it.  I've also been gradually phasing out of my high-school-esque shirts, which were usually T-shirts in solid colours.  Now I've been buying tops that you can't actually find in the men's section.  ;)  Note:  skirts are weird.  They actually sit at your waist.  I'm very much used to pants which sit at my hips, about two inches lower than my waist.  This will take some getting used to.  Anyways, yes, that is the news: Heather Ann -- now in skirts.  Prepare for an onslaught of sauciness.

						   When working in a greenhouse doing mostly physical labour, you must beware of the dangerous work conditions. These  urlLink petals of death  are killer when wet. If you step on them the wrong way, you WILL go flying and potenital kill yourself. I hate them. I hate cleaning those flowers and I hate putting them in the sleeves. They are a 'non-stop' pain in the butt! But I was never really one of those girls who ooed and aawed over flowers. Hey, do me a favour...and NEVER buy flowers again. Okay?! Okay, thanks. Okay, well maybe you get buy some flowers every once in a while, but try not to, especially when they are in 'season'. Okay bye.

						   I've been thinking about language lately, which is good because I'm majoring in Linguistics and I really should do things like that from time to time.  I've been thinking about what a strange thing it is that we have language at all... that we have these sets of grammar and vocabulary and intonation patterns that allow us to communicate.  I was sitting here reading  urlLink something about Semiotics  (semiotics is the study of how signs relate to their meaning), and I thought, "Language is such a funny thing.  Where did it come from?  How did we make it?" and then I realised that that's like asking where sight came from, or where walking came from.  How did we figure those things out?  How did we invent them?  We didn't.  If a human is healthy, barring abnormal circumstances, when they are able to walk, they will walk.  When they are able to see, they will see.  When they are able to speak, they will speak.  Language is still incomprehensible to me though.  How is it possible that I can say "ridiculous" and people know what I mean?  Once, way back when, someone explained to me what that word meant, or used it in the context of other words enough that I realised what it meant, but how did I know what  those  words meant?  And so on and so on until I am so young that I have no vocabulary, am without language, without the ability to walk, and I see all these people around me with those skills and I just try it out one day and then it grows and grows until one day I find myself writing a blog using all of these words that were defined by people using other words.  And how do I know that my words make other people think of what I think when I say them?  I know, I know, people say crap like that all the time, like the annoying blonde in Waking Life, who goes on this rant:   "Creation seems to come out of imperfection. It seems to come out of a striving and a frustration, and this is where I think language came from. It came from our desire to transcend our isolation and have some sort of connection with one another. And it had to be easy when it was just simple survival. Like the word 'water,' we came up with a sound for that, or 'sabre tooth tiger right behind you,' we came up with a sound for that. But when it gets really interesting is when we use that same system of symbols to communicate all the abstract and intangible things that we're experiencing. What is frustration? Or what is anger? Or love? When I say love, the sound comes out of my mouth and it hits the other person's ear, travels through this byzantine conduit in their brain, through their memories of love, or lack of love, and they register what I'm saying and they say yes, they understand. But how do I know they understand, because words are inert, they're just symbols, they're dead, you know?"   I want to slap her every time I watch that scene, but that could be the dumb voice and the up-talk.  I feel like she's on to something but somehow there's something missing there.  Language is natural to humans.  It takes very  urlLink bizarre circumstances  to prevent them from acquiring it.  It's one of those things that are inherently obvious to humans, like walking or breathing or laughing or unconscious flirting.  It's not like math.  Math is something that we are constantly adding to, it takes study, it doesn't show up in every culture.  It took us thousands of years to even think of having a zero in the system.  I feel like people like the Waking Life chick are looking at language like an invented system, like math.  Math is incredible and I feel like it is a complete system already, we just haven't discovered all of it, but I don't think it's like language.  The difference that I've been thinking about is not that language is more fluid than math, less concerned with absolutes, but that we acquire the two skills so differently.

						   Listening to Cat Power: 'Metal Heart' and their cover of 'Wonderwall'  This is the third blog entry I have tried to write today.  First I ranted for a bit about the book I'm reading (Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand), but then I feared that I would change my opinions by the time I got done the book, so maybe I'll finish it and then comment.  I like it so far though.  I like it a lot.  Then I tried to write one about emotions and how Sanda and I say we don't have them but really we're lying, but it just wasn't coming off well.  Sometimes I hate the things I write.  Self-criticism is one of the most self-defeating things ever.  I've been trying to think of what to do with my  urlLink other website  and I would like to do some writing about deconversion that I can put up there, but that is  so  intimidating.  It's hard to know where to start.  It's hard to know what I can say that I'll still agree with in 6 months.  :)  At the moment, there are five mugs, one glass, one tupperware bowl, two real bowls, four small plates, one big plate, three spoons, two forks, and one super-sharp knife on my desk.  And an empty Coke can.  And dental floss, a red crochet hook, a box of disks, lots of random pens, a package of crackers, moisturizing lotion, random paper, a card that Sanda made me for my birthday, some mail, a package of staples, MORE moisturizing cream, two candles, a cup full of pens, and a slinky.  And a desk lamp and my monitor/mouse/keyboard/speakers.  It's a bit cluttered.  They say that a cluttered desk is a sign of depression.  Actually, it's a sign of disorganization.  Oh, and a ball of wool.  I couldn't see that before, it was behind some mugs.  Surprise!  My thoughts are organized, my room is not!

						   I love Craigslist.  People use it as a dating service, to find out about events, to sell things, to rant and rave about things, to find apartments, lots of stuff.  I don't really post on it, have only used it to find housemates and the like, but the Best of Craigslist is super-funny.  Good entries I found today (warning: swearing):  -  urlLink To the grandma on the L Taraval line - 28  -  urlLink Memo Mostly About Post-Its  -  urlLink I'm sorry I swore at you from the attic of a Christian sorority - 25  -  urlLink you mentioned Sex and the City and then I punched you  -  urlLink Extremist Couch Must Go  -  urlLink Gay Waiter, You Tricked Us!  -  urlLink The Illustrated Guide To Me   Okay bye!

						    urlLink Caleb loves us.   I knew this blog was going somewhere.  Now we are the coolest kids on the block.  :)    urlLink (link to that particular entry, which is missing a stylesheet and therefore ugly)      For all of those visiting from Brock Vegas, if you don't know my co-blogger Sanda... she was on residence with me at  urlLink Tyndale University College  and we played much Speed Scrabble and Mancala and put up Adbusters posters in the dead of night and swore more than was probably appropriate and ranted and raved about stupid people and watched all of the Lord of the Rings DVDs (extras especially!) many many MANY times.  I think Sanda has the commentaries memorized.  Sanda was also Nata's roommate at the now-defunct Baptist Leadership Education Centre (BLEC!) and they had many adventures and killed more than their fair share of fish.  Now she is going to  urlLink Brock University  in St. Kitts.  She's a youth pastor and I'm an apostate.  The blog (and the friendship) works because we're both  urlLink INTJs  and therefore rock much harder than everyone else.  "Female INTJs are just as feminine as they want to be. They can be just as sweet and sexy as the next woman if they feel like. They are just opinionated and don't put up with stupidity for long."  Let's not forget the INTJ prayer: God, let me be open to other people's views, WRONG though they may be.  Amen, sister.  Amen.  That one's almost as good as the Bookdock Saints prayer.  What else....... this entry is getting rambly.  Oh well.  I have this week off, my job is to sit by the phone waiting to hear that I got the  urlLink job  I applied for last week.  My interview went really well, I made them laugh and had related experience for more than two thirds of the questions they asked me.  My work experience at Tyndale in the Communication department and also as a researcher (for a prof and for Student Development) came in handy, especially since they're familiar with Tyndale.  You know an interview is going well when you tell them about one of your past experiences and they say "yeah! that's how WE should do it! you know, the students we've had in the past did it this crappy way, but we like your way much better!"  Yeah, baby.  Now hire me.  Don't be coy.  In other news, Mike's  urlLink Paper Folding Fun!  entry is about the funniest thing ever this week.  Oh yes... and a small note on Mike's identity.  His real name is.... (duh duh duh!!!) Mike.  He is the boyfriend of my most wonderful of best friends, Janice.  He gets to live with her this summer and I don't.  Sense the incredible jealousy!  Also, he is also a hippie from B.C. who looks like  urlLink Jesus .  Simply divine.  (En plus, il ne parle pas Français et je ris de lui.)  (snow)!

						   I am not really going away to any place exciting, but I have started my 2nd job which is at a greenhouse. I am on the hanging basket team so I get to play with hanging baskets ALL DAY LONG. That would be from 7:30am until 4pm or the orders are done, which ever come first. So needless to say the days are going to be super long and I walk to and from work, which is a 40min walk. But I am looking forward to getting into shape and there are a lot of fun people working there. So anyways, the days ahead will be super busy. So don't expect much, not that you were, but yeah...anyways... Okay bye!

						   And if you don't, then you will soon find out that it does. What helps me get through times when I am finding that life is being crappy is some good ole' Ben Folds Five.  A good one to listen to if you feel that life is giving you a hard time is called Still Fighting It. It's pretty hard to find an mp3 of it so you can hear it but if you get the chance. Do it. Okay bye.

						   So I moved to camp this past weekend and all I have to say is that my cabin looks like Ikea. It was like one of those shows 'While you were out' or something of that nature. When I was at camp a month ago my cabin was looking sick and gorss. Now it looks....well at least trendy and liveable and has new windows! And walls! And a porch! It is this trendy puke green with dark navy blue painted on the beams, the door and all our furniture and we have a white ceiling. Then with a little furnishing from my cabinmate and there we have it Ikea. But to be honest it's not so bad. It's just a little bright in there. There's a spare bed in the loft if anyone cares to come visit.

						   I have yet to go to see Fahrenheit 911 ( urlLink trailer ), but  urlLink this article  is an interesting alternative perspective.  It's not supporting Bush, but it's certainly critical of Moore.  It might be Michael Moore's job to call Bush's bluff, but whose job is it to call Moore's bluff?  For example, he could have included the small yet important tidbit of information that the seemingly evasive Charlton Heston in Bowling for Columbine was suffering from Alzheimer's, but he didn't.  (link via  urlLink Mimi )  Personally, I hope Bush gets his ass kicked in the upcoming election and maybe charged with something for being so crazy and mismanaging money/troops/being disrespectful to dead soldiers/lying his pants off/refusing to pronounce "Iraq" or "nuclear" correctly/etc., but I'm learning not to trust everything that people say just because I agree with their basic premise.

						       Well, King Paul is back on the throne.  Sort of.  He got a minority government, won basically all of Toronto (kind of surprising), and is back in the game.  However, he's 16 seats below what he would need for a majority, so he's going to need to team up with this guy:  Jack Layton, here pictured on a bike because he "hasn't owned a car in years."  Jack's wife, Olivia Chow, stunningly lost her race last night, got beat out by a Liberal, which is disappointing.  She's still on Toronto City Council though.  Now, if Martin and Layton team up to make a joint Liberal-NDP government, that should work out alright, because we've done that before.  It might not work for  long , but it should work okay.  There's no question of teaming up with the Bloc, since they're separatists and based their campaign on mistrust of the Liberals.  There's no question of teaming up with the Tories, because... well, it's the Tories.  C'mon now.       Ah, Gilles Duceppe.  He won two thirds of Quebec, 54 seats.  He did extremely well, and he can thank Paul Martin for a good chunk of his success.  They were hoping to be the balance of power should a minority come up, but it looks like they won't be, since a Liberal-NDP alliance is expected.  In any event, he's got enough seats that he'll be in there scrapping it out for a long time to come, which I think is good because he seemed to be the only one really going for the issues in the debates.      Aww... poor scary Stephen Harper.  You know, I really do have a fear of the Tories, and I don't think it's because of the Liberal "campaign of fear" of the last five weeks.  I think it's more to do with the GWBush "policy of [instilling] fear" for the last FOUR FREAKING YEARS.  I know, I know, Harper isn't Dubya.  But the fact that he said that he supports the Iraq invasion  still  is mind-boggling to me, and I'd rather stay away from that kind of nonsense.  Oh, and I went to the Pride Parade on Sunday and they're  definitely  afraid of the Tories, and with good reason!  Sorry, Steve, I have this thing about equality and not discriminating against people because they're gay, or because they are desperate and feel they need an abortion, or because they "have" "WMDs" "and we know exactly where they are."     (I used a table in this post!  I haven't done that in years!)

						   Isn't that what the core message of every political ad in this smear-campaign race has been?  I think so.  It's gotten so ridiculous that I swear you could cut costs by making:  A. (1) anti-Liberal clip (1) anti-Conservative clip (1) anti-NDP clip (optional)  B. (1) pro-Liberal clip (1) pro-Conservative clip (1) pro-NDP clip  Take one or two from column A, one from column B, and ta da! You have a stellar Canadian election campaign.  Well, unless you're Gilles Duceppe.  Then you've got to re-do everything anyways for the francophones, so you might as well make your own.  Besides, they're separatists, they shouldn't get in on the Communal Election Campaign Ad Creation Dealio.  Somehow that would go against everything they stand for!  In other news, I have 6 hours left to vote and I still haven't decided.  Liberal or NDP...  It's a tough call.  Heck, odds are we're going to have to do this all over again in another six months, so maybe I'll just go Communist, for kicks.

						   Today I am leaving for  urlLink camp!  I am very excited to be going. Actually to be honest I am not that excited to be doing the head cook thing again, but that's okay. It's a fun job, I do enjoy it and I do a really good job as well. I just hope I can still remember how to do everything! I am excited though for other reasons. - to hang out with all my friends - Port - campfires - canoeing - windsurfing - the beach - Vespers - tormenting little kids (not really tormenting....muhahaha) - beautiful sunsets - adventures galore - growing with God - learning more about a lot of stuff  I am sure I could go on and on about camp. It has been known to happen before. Anyways, you should all send me lots of mail and special treats while I am at camp, then I will love you forever!  So anyways, yeah if there seems to be a lack of posts from me it is because I am enjoying the above forementioned things plus a whole plethora of other things. But I will be back and I will have some good stories to tell about. So miss me okay!?  Have a GREAT summer!! Okay bye!

						    Special, by Lydia Davis  We know we are very special.  Yet we keep trying to find out in what way: not this way, not that way, then what way?    City People, by Lydia Davis  They have moved to the country.  The country is nice enough: there are quail sitting in the bushes and frogs peeping in the swamps.  But they are uneasy.  They quarrel more often.  They cry, or she cries and he bows his head.  He is pale all the time now.  She wakes in a panic at night, hearing him sniffle.  She wakes in a panic again, hearing a car go up the driveway.  In the morning there is sunlight on their faces but mice are chattering in the walls.  He hates the mice.  The pump breaks.  They replace the pump.  They poison the mice.  Their neighbor's dog barks.  It barks and barks.  She could poison the dog.  "We're city people," he says, "and there aren't any nice cities to live in."

						   Today I met with an academic advisor at my school and I am so very excited because for me to graduate with my honours degree I have 9.5 credits left which means I have just under 2 years left if I go full time! If I take summer school I might be able to shave a semseter off! So I am super glad to know that I am on the right track and will be done soon. This year went by so fast and so will these next 2 and then from there...I have no idea - probably paying back all those student loans, but I will be done! But I really want to go on and get my masters for sure and I wouldn't mind getting my Doctrate. But there are a lot of other things I want to do, like travel! So I think in 2 years a nice break is needed!

						   I think I'm depressed.  I'm exhausted all the time, regardless of how much sleep I get.  I feel listless.  I am stressed out about how the hell I'm going to pay for things this year, though I'm fairly sure I've got that one covered (but barely).  I forget to eat.  I look through the fridge and realise that I don't want to eat anything that I have in the house, nor do I feel like I have the money to go to the grocery store yet again this week.  I walk through the grocery store and think, "I don't want any of this."  (note: I am eating enough, I'm just not enjoying it.  It's a chore.)  I feel like most of my best friends live in other cities.  I also feel like I'm growing apart from a lot of people.  At the same time, I'm not really meeting that many new people.  I'm constantly being hit by new ideas and philosophies and I don't have answers anymore because Christianity handed me all of my answers and now I have to figure it all out on my own and it's exhausting.  I read  Atlas Shrugged  (Ayn Rand) last month and thought Objectivism might be a good route to go, but now I'm reading  The Ayn Rand Cult  and realising that it's basically just a fundamentalist cult for atheists, and I'm sick of feeling like I'm getting the wool pulled over my eyes.  It makes me angry, I want to punch things when I realise how easily I get duped by things.  I feel like I should see the warning signs by now.  I'm tired of feeling like I have to explain myself (defend myself) because of my having left the faith, I'm sick of feeling like I don't really have solid viewpoints about anything anymore.  I'm tired of feeling guilty when people (family mostly) are upset over my 'decision', I wish they didn't think I was going to Hell, I'm sorry that they're frightened for me but  I can't fix it .  Not only that, I don't want to, I don't want back in, I wish they could be glad for me because it's honestly the bravest and most positive thing I've ever done, as hard as it is to deal with some of the fall-out sometimes.  If I had gone to university straight out of high school, I would have my B.A. by now.  Instead, I have another two years to go, and then who knows how many years of graduate school.  I'm sure there will be 17-year-olds in some of my classes this year and I will be turning 24 and I will be frustrated yet again because they will be so immature and stupid and loud and won't really care about academics and why aren't I meeting very many smart people at university?! WTF?  I want a break, I want a month off, but instead I have to work my ass off all summer just to make ends meet.  I don't have time to be depressed, I need to just keep going, and that makes it worse.  Stir in a bit of PMS and I'm not exactly a happy camper.

						   Okay so as a potential political science student I have been under some pressure to give some words about the upcoming election. I started a post earlier this month but I have neglected to complete it due to time and motivation. Anyways, my focus in studying is more in political theory but here are some thoughts about the election and the the parties involved.  Right off the bat all those special interest political groups (also known as identity politics) don't really stand a chance, mainly because they stand for a minority interest, but I am glad that they are out there. So give them a look (check the end of the post for some links).   The Liberals   It has been noted that Canadians tend to get pissed off at governments that make big screw-ups and they get 'punished' by not being re-elected. We saw that with the Tories and Brian Mulorney and his GST policy. Next election he was out of office and the Liberals were in. And now with all the scandals with Paul Martin, well people are pissed. So I highly doubt they will get in. I have a feeling the Tories will be back in because historically we have been a 2 party country - we are just a little too afraid of the NDP. So where do we go from here, the Liberals need to be out, 12 years is a fair share of being in power and well we are a 'mulitparty' system so let us use our democratic right and speak up and show the government that we want to see some changes. At one point in time they were the nice middle of the road government that you could trust to keep things on an even keel and not screw things up too badly. But that was once upon a time. Can the Liberal government be the government it was when people like Pearson and Trudeau were in charge? I do not think Paul Martin has that capability.  The Conservatives  I think the biggest question people have to ask themselves when they look at this party is "Do you want a government or a corporation?" Seriously, the amount of times I have heard business associated with the Tories in insane. And not just from business people who want the Tories in. Today I was listening to the radio and the Leader of the Ontario Conservative Party was talking about how it should be like a business and there should be credibility in those actions etc. Granted, I want credibility in my leaders and their actions. Do I want the heads of these governments making decisions that benefit the top and those who feed into the top? No, mainly because I am not one of those people. I believe government should be set up for the protection of the people. The government should be extending benefits to its citizens as well as putting restrictions on things. And if the Tories got in you can bet on those things becoming passe. They will put restrictions on everything that would prevent a greating profit from being gained. And those who are going to provide a profit for the 'country', then it is okay if they ignore the laws and rights we have set up to protect people. However, I will give them this. Their platform makes sense and even seems reasonable in most areas. BUT, past experiences of Tories saying and not doing are still a huge black mark on them and so my vote did not go there.   The NDP  They can be a little intense and well scary. But then I look at countries which have let a more socialist government lead them and some of them are the number one country to live in, like Sweden, Switzerland and Norway. Now they are a little pricy to live in as far as taxation is concerned, but I think if you want your government to provide some things then you need to put out a little. But that is just me.  Their platform touches on a lot of things that the other 2 does not. We have a Consumer Bill of Rights being promoted. It seems interesting. This was one of my favourite promises as well, "Removing the GST from family essentials, starting with children’s clothing and medicine, school supplies, books, magazines, women’s hygiene products, and medical equipment." Now, if they get in and if they actually do it, will I be impressed.   I must say that off all the platforms I have read (though not all of them in their entireities) that the NDP's impressed me the most. It was clear to follow and read and they clearly stated the problem and how they are going to solve it. Next would be the conservatives and lastly the liberals. The NDP was the only party to address things like Women's Equality, the Aboriginals, AIDS and the environment. The Liberals talked a lot about what their vision was...vision is good but it needs a strong mission to back that up. And the conservatives at least have a plan. I would challenge you all to think about what Canada means to you and what is important to you as a tax paying citizen. At least use your democratic right and vote, it does make a difference.    Read the platforms for yourself and go and ask your riding's candidates the questions and concerns you have.  Check out these for more information:   urlLink The Conservatives   urlLink The Liberals   urlLink The New Democratic Party (NDP)   urlLink The Bloc Quebecois   You can also check out these parties:  urlLink The Green Party   urlLink The 'Mary Jane' Party   urlLink Christian Heritage Party    urlLink Canadian Action Party   urlLink These Crack heads   Some other sites of intrest might be:  urlLink Social Justice   urlLink Vote for a Change?   And if you have forgotten, the election is Monday June 28th, so get to a poll!

						    urlLink This quiz  says that I should vote NDP.  I got these results:  Jack Layton Leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada (score = 100) Gilles Duceppe Leader of the Bloc Quebecois (score = 90) Paul Martin Leader of Liberal Party of Canada, Prime Minister of Canada (score = 45) Stephen Harper Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada (score = 15)  Somehow I knew Steve would be at the bottom.  Aww, sweetie, do I support gays and pro-choicers and think that your military plans are scary?  Pauvre petite.  I'll have to look some more at the NDP platform tonight.  I might go to the  urlLink Franco-Fête  tonight for St. Jean's.  Vive le Québec!

						   So, there are five more days until the election and I still don't know who I'm going to vote for.  I'm actually leaning Liberal.  I have three reasons:  1) Jack Layton seems like a used-car salesman, not a Prime Minister; 2) Stephen Harper seems plastic, and his party is right-wing (moderate or not, I'd like to swing  away  from the Dubya side of things); 3) being in Ontario, I can't vote for Gilles Duceppe.  Good ol' King Paul might get my vote, just for the lack of better alternatives.  Do you guys know who you're going to vote for yet?  Give me some ideas here, I want to know why you're leaning one way or the other, or why you just plain can't decide.  Is anyone planning to abstain?  (Them there Yanks can stay out of this one - just do your patriotic duty and get the madman out of office this November.)

						   I'd like to congratulate one  urlLink Holly Skelton , as she is hereby awarded the Strangely Comfortable Mid-2004 Queen of Blogging Slackitude Award.  She hasn't posted since May 25th.  Three more days and it will have been a month!  The Strangely-Comfortable Mid-2004 King of Blogging Slackitude Award goes to  urlLink Mike Westby , not to be confused with  urlLink Jesus . (Last post, June 11.)  The Strangely-Comfortable Mid-2004 Communal Blogging Slackitude Award goes to  urlLink various non-rational animals , for their inability to average more than 7 posts per month, despite the fact that there are three of them (and the last post was June 2).  Thanks for all of your hard work, or the lack thereof.  More awards will probably be forthcoming, once Sanda catches wind of this.  ;)

						   So, I might have another job lined up after all.  My current job is due to end in another few weeks, since I'm editing an Handbook that needs to go to print pretty soon.  Another of York's colleges called my boss today wondering about their handbook, so I might end up doing theirs as well.  $10/hour... wow, that's getting to seem like a  very  low wage these days.  In other news, I signed up for courses today.  Here's what I'm looking at for next year:    AS/LING 2120 Fundamentals of Phonological Analysis : Practical techniques of phonological analysis exemplified by data taken from a variety of languages. Practice in the use of distinctive features and rule formalisms.  AS/LING 2140 Fundamentals of Grammatical Analysis : Practical techniques of grammatical analysis exemplified by data taken from a variety of languages.  AS/LING 2430 Language, Power and Persuasion : This course investigates the language of power and persuasion. The language used by powerful and powerless groups is analyzed to determine how it reinforces positions of dominance and subordination. The role of language in public persuasion is also considered.  AS/LING 3160 Discourse Analysis : This course provides an analysis of spoken and written texts in context. Specific topics include spoken versus written discourse; the role of context in the interpretation of utterances; cohesion and coherence; and the relationship between information structuring and grammatical forms.  AS/LING 3120 Phonology : Theoretical principles and practical techniques of phonological analysis exemplified by data taken from a variety of languages.   AS/LING 3140 Syntax : This course provides a basic introduction to generative syntax, in particular to the recent work of Noam Chomsky and his followers. Although most of the data analyzed will be English, syntactic patterns of some other languages will be discussed.   AK/NATS 1700 Computers, Information and Society : Selected survey of the history of computing, information technology and communication and critical discussion of their social impact.  AK/SOSC 1900 Sexuality, Gender and Society : This course examines how the meaning and significance of sexuality, family, work and public life have varied historically for men and women. It is particularly concerned with analyzing the social definition and control of women and homosexuality, which has largely taken place in the interests of the dominant class of heterosexual “masculine” males.   I'm excited about this year to an unreasonably high extent.  Me=linguistics geek, yessiree.  I should be writing course descriptions for this school, I could make them much more entertaining.

						   Lately I have just been putting on the Media Library and letting the computer chose what I listen to. Normally I skip over the tv themes and things I do not like but today I thought I would list the songs I have listened to as I have done my paperwork.  Now I don't have a huge collection of music such as some others I know and that is mainly because most of the music I own is on cd, I am a little old fashion that way. But here is a sample of what I've got.  1. Lauren Hill-You're Just too Good to be True 2. Chris Tomlin-Enough 3. The Simpsons-Prank Calls 4. Marcy Playground-Sherry Fraser 5. Tchaikovsky-1812 Overture 6. Alanis Morrisette-Head Over Feet 7. Evita-You Must Love Me (Amanda, I really laughed when this came on! Banquet Memories!) 8. Thousand Foot Krutch-Ordinary 9. Rascal Flatts-I'm Moving On 10. Avril Lavinge-Unwanted 11. Addams Family Theme 12. Velet Underground-Black Angels Death Song 13. Newsies-Carrying The Banner 14. Muppets Theme 15.

						   Going back here about 2 years ago when I was working at  urlLink camp,  we were given the task of painting the tuck shop. The boys on staff (please note most were from the SPEW youth group) lobbied as firecely as they could to get the tuck some to be pained with PinkAndBrown Racing strips. To no avail would anyone sponser their pledge. However, something unexpected happened, well 2 things actually. 1) The theme of PinkAndBrown caught on and soon people were making bracelets, trying to wear it and incorporate it into everything because well it's camp and we thought it was funny and silly to have such a horrible colour combination. 2) The second unexpected event was that it became Popular. That fall PinkAndBrown was everywhere in stores and it still continues to be. So I have taken up the cause and support adamently the continuation of such horrible colour combinations of PinkAndBrown because well it's so bad that it's soo good.

						   At first it tastes soo good and you get a little high and it gets you through things like waiting for the bus. But then, oh then when you got home the high was gone and the mood swing sets in and the tummy starts yelling, "Why do you cause me such misery!?" And so in my misery and pain I lie on the couch vowing never to eat a chocolate donut and drink chocolate milk at the same time again. Never will I over consume on chocolate again. Of course I have said this before, but then I remember how good it tastes and it starts again, the good feeling that soon disintergrates into certain near death misery.

						   So, there's this billboard advertisement near the subway station that I go to every day on my way to work that has an ad right now for Canada's own coffee company,  urlLink Tim Horton's .  It has a picture of their Iced Cappuccino, on a beach, with a sand shovel in the top in lieu of a straw.  I think they're trying to make a connection between the beverage and the goodness of summer fun and childhood simplicity, but every time I see it, I think "Oh, the sand shovel is in the cappuccino, so the cappuccino must be... sand.  Or sand-like.  It  is  brown like sand."  and then I am grossed out because I think of sipping sand through a straw and you know you can't get through that without gagging rather painfully.  Am I too analytical for modern advertising?  I usually end up making connections that are quite the opposite of what the makers were intending.  (If you were ever in doubt as to who was the Queen of Run-On Sentences, I think this entry quite clearly established my station in life.)

						   Fatty went home today. I actually miss her. There was no incessant meowing when I walked thru the door tonight. I hope she adjusts well back to the craziness of my parents place. She will have another cat and 2 dogs to keep her company while I am gone for the summer. But this week will be quiet without her here, no one licking my face to get up in the mornings, or meowing in my ear. I think I will like it (the quietness), but I think I will miss it as well.   PS: Fatty's real name is Reef and she is my pet cat.

						    urlLink Brad Sucks  is an alternative/something band from Ottawa.  It has one member, Brad, who does all of the mixing, vocals, and instrumentation himself, and it doesn't suck at all.  Go, download the free mp3s and bask in the goodness of people who understand how to broaden a fan base by cooperating with the Internet rather than working against it.

						    urlLink Bobby 's back and his puppy is the cutest of the cute.  All hail the return of the former king of perceptions.diaryland.com, one of the first blogs that I was ever addicted to!  He once said, "Jesus is the perfect father figure.  You always hear stories about him and he's supposedly coming back someday."  Entries to note: -  urlLink whether i attend a social event or not is sometimes influenced by how much cake will be present.  -  urlLink re: sincerely  -  urlLink it is better to have loved and lost than to have had your hand get stuck in a kitchen garbage disposal.  -  urlLink whenever somebody asks me about what i'm going to do after high school, i usually reply with, "make a sandwich then take a nap."  -  urlLink trying to calculate in my head the square root of oatmeal   ...and much much more that I don't have time to search for right now.  There's a funny story about following random cars at night, and another about a Do Not Steer sign.  Going to see Harry Potter III tonight.  I think the formula for this movie might be:  1. Wizards and witches 2. Puberty 3. ??? 4. PROFIT!  but we'll see.

						   Last night we had a surprise birthday party for one of the guys.  So we went over, had a BBQ, did some swimming, roasted some marshmellows and just had a good time. Now you have to understand that the party was for someone one who was part of the 'old' spew youth group so we had a range of ages last night. Also one of the bigger surprises was seeing L.P who most of the guys have not seen in forever. As well the old spew was all guys with like 1 girl and the 'new' spew consists mostly of girls and 2 guys. So the night for the older guys became this reminiscing of past shenanigans. Well that just lead to the obivious (for us...let's get D! Our old youth leader!!) So the younger kids went home and off we went to Shoppers. There were 6 of us in total, 5 guys and me.   Our original plan was to take those window markers and write all over her car. But the store did not have any so all 6 of us are standing in this aisle way trying to figure out what we should do. Meanwhile the security person kept walking by to make sure we weren't stealing anything. So we buy our purchases which included 2 things of saran wrap (120 metres in total!), rosebud chocolates, ribbon and a bow. So off we drive out to the middle of nowwhere where D lives. We park the car down the road and quietly sneak towards her place and we saran wrap her car, put some chocolates on (now we were nice, and put saran wrap first and then the chocolates and then more saran wrap over top), and totally saran wrapped her car. Meanwhile we had to keep hiding because of the occasional car and because there were still lights on inside the house and we could hear people moving so we would have to stop occasionly. But we eventually got the deed done and topped off the car with a bow. (We had forgetten the ribbon in the van).  So we went back to the van and heh, well someone in our group kept trying to document our adventure by taking pictures. We left, went and got some 'stuff' and then came back and placed the 'stuff' on her lawn. Now if I told you what this stuff was I would be totally incriminating us and plus we aren't too sure how legal our actions were. See!? I have said far too much!! Anyways it was a great night of some good ole' fashion SPEW fun! All we needed was some dry ice to end off the night and it would have been just like old times!

						   Today is my father's last day of work before retiring from what used to be  urlLink Du Pont Canada .  He's worked there for 29 years, and he starts school on Monday to become a trucker.  I'm making CDs for him.  :)   urlLink Strindberg and Helium : A hilarious mix of deep angst and cheer.  Link thanks to one Matthew Barton, of the Barton clan, whom I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link to yet.   urlLink And you must see this.   Every once in a while, a commercial comes along that is just so funny and potentially offensive, you're sure it will never get aired.  This is one of those.  If you didn't see the  urlLink Nutrigrain commercial  a couple months back, you're missing out.  Watch it, you'll feel GREAT.  (babies everywhere!!)  I have the day off, w00t!  :)

						   So, it's 5:30am and I've been up for 2 hours.  Very unlike me, and I'm about to go back to bed.  Yesterday I got to work for 6:30am because it was the day of Convocation.  My job for the last month or so has been to organize name cards, diplomas, alumni cards, certificates, who still owes the University money, who's also graduating with a B.Ed., who's missing stuff, etc etc, for 600 graduates from the Faculty of Pure and Applied Science and the Faculty of Kinesiology and Health Sciences.  So, my day consisted of being one of two people out of a 14-person team who actually knew what she was talking about, and directing graduates on where to go and when and why, and telling them, "Yes, you owe us $4900 in parking fines, no, we can't give you your diploma until you pay us" (true story!).  People are so strange.  The ceremony was at 10, the invitations told them to be there by 7:30 at the latest because they have to get robes, name cards, get in order, get on-stage before the ceremony, etc.  We had people show up at 9:50 and be surprised that they weren't early.  I also had three Asian men giggling and arguing with me about whether they had to wear a robe if they didn't want to.  They thought it was too feminine or something?  I don't know.  But no, it's actually necessary, if you want to be a part of the ceremony.  But yeah, the day went pretty much without a hitch, and I got free cake, so yay for that.  Then I came home and took a "nap" around 6:30 that lasted until 3:30am.  Whoops!  Now my sleeping schedule is going to be a bit weird for a few days.  Thoughts on the election debates, from left to right:  Stephen Harper: Made some good jabs at King Paul ("who are you to say that you know the numbers, Mr. I Was The Finance Minister During The Sponsorship Scandal?"), seemed quite composed for most of it, except when Paul kept harping on about things that Steve had already denied.  Said that he would use the Notwithstanding Clause for child pornography, which was a good move, because no one wants to support child pornography.  Didn't make much eye contact, didn't participate much more than necessary for most of the debate.  Didn't seem to understand why Paul objected to his plan of "cut taxes, increase spending".  Math, anyone? Paul Martin: Made aforementioned good point against Harper, spent most of the debate dodging questions and trying to defend himself.  Refused to answer Duceppe's question about whether ministers who knew about the sponsorship scandal were still on the Liberal team.  Looked at the camera, not at his opponents, which is fine, he needs to convince us, not them.  Didn't look like a total ass.  Would look better if he could have said "since I've been PM, I've done X, Y, and Z", but I'm not sure he's done much other than investigating the sponsorship scandal, which doesn't look good. Jack Layton: Who are we kidding?  This man looks and sounds like a sleazy used car dealer.  He talked through everyone, saying the same things over and over, and spouted more slogans than I can count.  Smiled WAY too much.  It made it look like "The Liberals have destroyed healthcare, yay!!!!!!", which makes him look like a psycho. Gilles Duceppe:  Even in his second language, this guy dominated.  He obviously knew his stuff, not just from reading up on it, but from participating in federal government for a long time.  I think, if anything, he would be a good Opposition leader, just because he knows the right buttons to press to get things done.  Now if only I was Québecois...  My high school had a Parliament instead of Student Council, and we had Sessions of Parliament that the whole school had to attend every month.  I was usually back on the bleachers with friends of mine who would spend the time trying to see how many bird calls they could make without getting caught (Chad, I'm sure you remember this), but I did pay attention to a good deal of what went on.  I also voted, usually against the person that I wanted to be the Leader of the Opposition, because it was an important role, and I wanted to make sure that the Opposition party would actually get in there and stir things up.  Would Martin make a good Opposition leader?  Who knows, do we know if anything he says is true and not just party slogans?  Would Harper?  The guy has made a campaign out of being Not Liberal and keeping his mouth mainly shut other than that, I'd like to see someone more feisty in there.  Would Layton?  Geez, Layton.  Jack, please... go back to your City Councils job and let someone a bit more professional-looking and sounding take your spot in the NDP.  For the love of your own party, cut it out with the "an all-exclusive one-time offer! we're not the Liberals OR the Conservatives! that's why you should vote for us! because everyone just laughs at our budget!"  So, my pick for Opposition would be  le grand Gilles Duceppe, l'homme qui sait de ce qu'il parle .  So, uh... I'll not vote for Gilles.   Vive le Canada!

						   Tonight is the federal election English-language debate.  I expect you all to watch, or I will kick you.  I'm taping it for my roommate, who has a blind date tonight, otherwise she would be watching with me and drinking copious amounts of tea.  The Toronto Star made me laugh today in one of their articles about last night's French-language debate: "I swear I heard [Martin] say, instead of "lower taxes" his government would, in the Quebec vernacular, "f&#151;" them, a slip easily made with the verbs  baisser  and  baiser " ( Something lost in the translation , Antonia Zerbisias).  They also had this to say: "Harper, sporting a haircut that, while making him seem a tad  tête carrée  (literally "square head," but actually means English) at least didn't look like a toupée.  He opened impressively, without that annoying heavy-footed accent that makes so many anglophone French-speakers sound, well, kind of dumb.  Pity about the baby blue pocket hanky though."  Watch the debates tonight!  And vote!  Unless you're leaning towards voting Conservative, then you can stay home and I won't mind at all.

						   The weather has been so incredible lately. During the day it is hot and beautiful and then in the evening or at night there have been these incredible thunderstorms. Ahh such beauty.   So Friday, Meagan, Tom, Drew and Gillian and I went to go see Harry Potter 3. It was good. We got there and the show we were going to see was sold out, so we went to Boston Pizza and then went and saw the 9:45 show. As we were returning to the theatre we were nearly killed as this jerk was driving along the parking lot at 80 and didn't stop as at the stop sign so he almost t-boned us as we went to park. Good thing someone screamed and caught Drew's attention!  So Saturday I went shopping with Meagan and spent WAY too much money- but now I am cool with my etnies zip-up hoodie, burton tooque and roxy pullover sweater. Really, I am not much of a brandname girl. My favourite stores are ones like  urlLink Giant Tiger.  I can't help it though when I do find brandname clothing on sale (like half off - can't beat that!), I have to buy it! Especially when it is soo nice looking and makes me look so saucy! owow!!  I also had my first taste of the Harvest Barn Country Marketplace. Soooooo good!   Then SPEW went mini-putting Saturday night in the Falls and then we had a 'sleepover' at the church. So needless to say not much sleep was attained. Oh and I was so mad, because during one of the rounds of sardines (and I was the one hiding) I had to give up my wicked cool hiding spot because one of the kids set off the alarm and I had to deactivate it! So sad. It's a good thing I have other wicked cool spots to hide in still. (My church is 173 years old...there are many good nooks and crannies to hide in!)  Sunday I slept all afternoon, once I got home from church (aka work). And then I went to church in Hamilton at Church on the Rock. Good times, good times. And then we headed to our traditional spot for food (Licks) and then some went home and others went to play pool (our of age crowd). I usually go and play pool if that is where my ride is going, but this time I opted to go and spend some time with the fam.  So last night was going to be a do nothing night. I took the day off to get some housework stuff done and to just recover from the weekend when at 10:30pm my friend gave me a call. So we went out for Tim Horton's and walked the pier. Such a good place to have the best chats!   So between work, hanging out with people and sleep...I sometimes make it to a computer and then I sometimes feel motivated to post.

						   So, I have three more Gmail invites if anyone's dying for a Gmail address.  I got three last week and have used them up already, on 2 very deserving people, and 1 almost-as-deserving person.  Used the last one last night and then this morning I had three more in my box!  Who knows how these things work?  Maybe they just love me.  I was reading in the paper last week that Google hires PhDs of all kinds, they have former brain surgeons and rocket scientists working for them, and they require their employees to spend a certain percentage of their time at work working on projects of personal interest.  How much do I want to work for this company?  That would be so awesome.  And, really, if I ever really do get a PhD in Linguistics, that would be a good fit.  Back in the sixties, no one in Linguistics ever believed that translation software would be possible at all, and now it's a common feature on search engines.  It still needs a lot of work, though, and that's where people like me come in.  So, yes.  A short note to the young-billionaires-who-invented-Google ( urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2 ) please hire me.  I do personal projects in my spare time anyways, you might as well pay me for it.  :)  Summer is sneaking up on me.  It's going up to 26 degrees today.  This is just the beginning of a long, smog-induced, muggy, swelteringly hot summer.  Skirts, now is your time to come to my rescue.  Also, sunscreen, I should remember you in my time of red-haired, fair-skinned, good god the sun is bright, need.  And I need to buy sunglasses for the first time ever!  I have had prescription glasses since about grade 3, and now I have contacts, and this is a whole new idea for me.   urlLink QuirkyAlone .  That's me, INTJ QuirkyAlone.  Yeehaw, I will never date again.  Haha.  Seriously, though, I've never really had a burning need to be dating someone (desire, yes; need, no).  Apparantly I'm not the only one!   urlLink Right, MerE?   Remember, boys and girls, if you want to have yournamehere@gmail.com,  urlLink start sucking up !

						   A short list of things I did at home this past weekend, because I don't have time to do a real entry:  - went out for  urlLink coffee  - went to my dad's retirement dinner - saw a tree 10 feet in diameter ripped out of the ground and lying on someone's yard, obviously thrown there because there was no damage to the ground anywhere around it (yay tornadoes! scary!) - non-chalantly put salt on the salad my dad was in the middle of eating (see also: caused my mother to laugh until she was wiping away tears) - went for "tea" with my dad - had a theological discussion with my mother that went really well - saw my 2 year old cousin, got a hug and a pat on the back from him, because he's super-cute - went for a bike ride with my youngest sister - bought a phone for $2.50 at a University Or Bust Yard Sale - got on a bus that took a detour through Trenton to avoid unnecessary traffic on the 401, saw CFB Trenton, sat on the side of the road for a while as our driver had run away to ask for directions - cut my knee rather badly while shaving, bled profusely - started a nasty political discussion between two people who had just met (oops!) - survived without the Internet for 3 days, as my parents' modem got hit by lightning or something - found some stories I wrote in grade 8, complete with better-than-I-expected illustrations - came home and promptly ate a quarter of a watermelon

						   I think one of the reasons that I feel so at home here in St. Catharines is that I have a family away from home. It is a good thing because with this family they are there when I need them and they really let me live my own life and do my own thing. But it is great to know that when my mom can't be there, I have at least 3 other women I can turn to for motherly type help. It is just really great to know that these women care soo much for me and are willing to do so much for me. They offer to drive me places, take me out, take me shopping and buy me little things all the time. They are soo cool!!  Dorothy finally moved all her stuff to her new office which means...I HAVE MY OWN OFFICE NOW!!! YAY!!! I am really excited to have a place to get away to over the course of the year. I am excited that I can be more organized and it is air-conditioned!!! I had an 'office' at the church but it was the old sunday school room and it was small and messy and crowded and not much could be done in there, so I am really excited that I have shelves and filing cabinets and comfy chairs!!And my office come with a key!

						   My alarm clock is a radio set to  urlLink CBC Radio One  and I woke up to Metro Morning this morning and they were doing a story about a local school full of immigrant kids.  They are set at a disadvantage in our curriculums much of the time, because they're learning to read in a language that they don't necessarily know yet, so not only do they have the modern distractions of TV to convince them that reading is boring, it's also much more difficult than it is for English-speaking kids.  So, their teachers set a challenge: read 100 books and we'll have a party and invite someone famous to come read books to you.  They did it, and guess who came over?  None other than  urlLink Robert Munsch !  He stayed over with one of the kids' families the night before, had a barbeque with them and invited people over, got together with a bunch of kids in the morning and wrote stories with and about them, and then they did two sets of readings.  There are 500 kids in the school and parents were invited too, so they went in shifts of 250 kids.  What's the first clip they played from him? "MORTIMER!!!!!!" ( urlLink hear it! )  That's especially excellent, because when  I  was little, Robert Munsch came to  my  school and read that story to us and it was great.  Oh Robert Munsch.  I heart him.  He wrote two of my favourite books of all time:  urlLink The Paper Bag Princess , and I Love You Forever ( urlLink listen to him read it! ).

						   To start off, I had the strangest dream last night where I was trying to solve this murder mystery and one of the ladies that I worked with at the greenhouse went psycho and tried to kill me and then Ben Folds Five came to save the day. I don't understand. It was bizzare.  Anyways this weekend was my church's Family Camp and we had many adventures. So here are some highlights. (Note: Not all will be highly entertaining to you, but I don't care cause this is sort of like a journal for me, so I am going to write down all the memorable things for me).  1. For our first session we were sitting outside under the trees. The speaker was speaking (as they often do) and this stray cat that was hanging around the camp was meowing and wandering in and around the people. Then all of a sudden she sees something and bounds out to the field. Later on we she the cat coming back walking proudly with a very large dead mouse in her mouth. Everyone can see her but the speaker so we are all whispering and pointing and giggling and finally the speaker said, "Am I missing something?" to which we all laughed and pointed at the cat.   2. I went canoeing with Drew and Gillian before supper and that was just one giant laugh fest as we tried all sort of methods for canoeing. Mainly just sitting on the stern amd bow decks and trying to paddle. As I was the bow, I sat facing the stern on the bow deck and paddled backwards. When we got closer to shore, I tipped the canoe, even though we all had wanted to, I just did without warning the other 2. I learned that Gillian can laugh like Goofy when she really gets laughing. Man, we had some good laughs out there on good ole' Lake Erie!  3.Saturday night after the evening program which by the way at my Baptist camp with my Baptist church was a Square Dance! Good times, good times! Anyways after some dancing and some snacking...15 of us plus others who came in and out, crammed into one of the boys cabins and watched the last period of the Calgary game (and we watched the 2 overtimes, and the sad loss of the Flames. But there is hope! Game 7 tonight!! GO Flmaes GO!!!) By the way, our camp does not come equipped with TV's in the cabins, we brought one up. Anywaays that was a lot of fun.  4. Okay the title feature. I am not to sure how appropriate this is to blog about, but it is funny, at least it is to me. WARNING: This story deals with gross things like poo. There is a woman who attends our church who has down syndrome, she is in her 40's. So after breakfast Saturday morning I went to use the washroom in the dining hall. The door was shut, but sometimes that means nothing. I tried to see if the light was on, and I couldn't really tell, and sometimes people leave the light on. This washroom is a one person one. So I open the door and I see D sitting there and so I quickly apologize and shut the door. I was on dishes so I continued with that and when I was done went back to the washroom. As I looked in the toliet I noticed the biggest, thickest log sitting in the bowl. It was disgusting. But it needed to be flushed before anything else joined it. So I spent a good 10-15 minutes wrestling with the toliet trying to flush this beast down. All the while trying hard not to focus on what I was flushing and trying hard not to vomit. Anyways, finally after waiting for the tank to fill again and again and finally getting a winning flush it went down the hole (animanics anyone?) and I was able to go to the bathroom! As I came out and passed D who was sitting with people she started to laugh and laugh and just look at me! And it sort of made me a little ticked actually, because she knew what she had done! I guess it just reminded me that people who are mentally handicapped can have the ability to be vindictive. Well I don't think she was entirely being vindictive, but she obviously knew what she had done, but she went hysterical about it. She was laughing so much that people where asking what was so funny, that I had to respond with "I walked in on her when she was in the washroom". Which could have been what she was laughing about, but I do not think so. I just think it is humourous that I was 'punished' for walking in on her!   5. This one isn't really humourous, it just amazes me how people can change. The woman who was doing the cooking for our group used to do a lot of head cook stuff at camp and I had to work with her once when I was the assistant cook. It was hell. I was convinced that she hated me, well she did. Who else comes and take pictures when the kitchen is dirty to show the camp committee that the head cook is irresponsible? (by the way, the dirtiness consistent of 2 unswept piles of dirt in the back.) Anyways, I try to avoid her at all costs. Anyways, this weekend she came up to me and just started talking and was super nice to me ALL weekend long. I could not believe it. Usually she is snarky with me and bosses me around. But this weekend she came and asked me what my thoughts were and what would I do. She even asked me if her chili passed the inspection! I think it might be because last summer I went to another camp and so now L has a new target to hate and that was the girl who was head cook last year. This means though that I have now made it into the books as a legendary head cook. Which is a good place to be if you are going to be a head cook.   Well that was my weekend. Right now I am enjoying my unemployment and just hanging out. It will be nice to have some time to just relax and do nothing.

						   I alluded to this earlier, and I am finally done my website detailing how I left the faith that almost the entire audience of this blog cherishes.  Hi guys!  Anyhow.  If you are curious and want to see some fun web design that hails back to the days before blogs, knock yourselves out.  This is me being vulnerable, so be nice, yo.   urlLink Faith Dissolved   Also: if you send me feedback (I made a form! or you can  urlLink email me ) and ask me questions, then I will write you back and might just set up a FAQ to deal with the most persistent misunderstandings or cries for more information.  Also also: note how easy the navigation is and that there is a PHOTO of me on there!  I, who despise nearly every photograph ever taken of me!  And that quotes are coloured red, in an ironic allusion to red-letter versions of the Bible!  And that I used a  urlLink blogground !

						   Last night I went to Waterloo for supper because it is my friend Eleanor's birthday today (HAPPY BIRTHDAY ELEANOR)! And after a fine supper of Keith's and ribs we went back to her place for cake and ice cream and then came home.   This morning when I woke up I was not feeling soo good, plus I had a ton of stuff to get ready for the weekend so I called in sick to work. Later this morning, they called me to inform me that I am laid off because as the season is coming to a close they really don't need as many people. Our first round of layoffs was Tuesday and the second round was today. I don't mind being laid off, it means I no longer have to get up at 6:30am!! But now I am semi-umemployed for 3 weeks. I have the job at the church and then I go to camp. But for 3 weeks I have next to nothing to do. So I am thinking that maybe I will go on an adventure. I am not to sure where and if anyone will go with me, but I need some place exciting to go, so PLEASE send me some ideas and create wonderful adventures for me to expereince. The longest period of time I could do this adventure in would be one week. I want to go somewhere I have never been, which believe it or not has been the Western part of Canada, so I am thinking I might start my adventure in either B.C. or Manitoba...I guess it would depend on what my bank account says!

						   Sometime when I wake up in the morning and get ready for work, I have no concept of what I might look like...I just desire comfort. So is it a problem if I wear my bright yellow camp shirt with my red fleece zip-up hoodie? For me, no. But for you....maybe. Luckily my brain kicked in and stopped me from embarking on such a dangerous fashion faux pau.

						    urlLink Someone  asked me the other day about Kafka.  His most famous story is called 'The Metamorphosis,' about a man who turns into a cockroach and how he and his family deal with the issues arising from that (i.e. his mother is afraid of cockroaches, he was the family's breadwinner and now can't work, etc).  Kafka is famous for taking normal conflicts and highlighting them by throwing in absurd elements but not making any of his characters aware that it's absurd.  This particular story does not have any absurd elements; it's one of his shorter stories, from my book entitled  Franz Kafka, 1883&#150;1924, The Complete Stories .  It acts a character sketch, much like the stories of  urlLink Lydia Davis , who tries to give an impression of a person in as few words as possible.  Tolstoy does that too, often writing a story that has little to no plot, but explores an emotion or an aspect of a relationship in detail.  Anyways, the story for today:    Rejection    When I meet a pretty girl and beg her: "Be so good as to come with me," and she walks past without a word, this is what she means to say:  "You are no Duke with a famous name, no broad American with a Red Indian figure, level, brooding eyes and a skin tempered by the air of the prairies and the rivers that flow through them, you have never journeyed to the seven seas and voyaged on them wherever they may be, I don't know where.  So why, pray, should a pretty girl like myself go with you?"  "You forget that no automobile swings you through the street in long thrusts; I see no gentleman escorting you in a close half-circle, pressing on your skirts from behind and murmuring blessings on your head; your breasts are well laced into your bodice, but your thighs and hips make up for that restraint; you are wearing a taffeta dress with a pleated skirt such as delighted all of us last autumn, and yet you smile&#151;inviting mortal danger&#151;from time to time."  "Yes, we're both in the right, and to keep us from being irrevocably aware of it, hadn't we better just go our separate ways home?"   Translated by Willa and Edwin Muir

						   I went to go and get my photos developed today and I had to wait an hour. So I decided to walk down to the  urlLink pier.  And the weather was amazing. I stood on the beach and watched the dark cumulonimbus clouds roll acroos the sky from Toronto. It was quite impresive to watch the ligthning hit the different spots across the lake, like Toronto, Missisauga and Burlington. I eventually had to head home and the storm clouds and lightning followed me home so soon the lightning was hitting different spots in Port. It was really neat because it felt as though the clouds were following me home and it almost became a race to see what would happen first; the onslaught of rain or me returning home. I won, though I still have to go and get my photos. I find watching thunderstorms highly entertaining because they are soo powerful and impressive. And the beauty is extraordinarie because it is so vast that it almost seems magical.

						    urlLink Chris  and I are going to ye olde  urlLink Brock Vegas  this weekend, so if anyone wants to hang out, give me a shout at my  urlLink parents' place .  Dani, Caleb, Chad, I'm looking at you guys.  A trip to Don's Fish & Chips is in order, so if anyone wants to join us... :)  Yay, and I get to see the St. Lawrence River, of which I am so fond.      urlLink If It Had Not Been For 15 Minutes...  is a real life story of espionage in East Germany in the late 70s.  Lots of interesting information about the  urlLink STASI , the security and intelligence unit of the East German government.  It's neat that he is able to tell his story on the Internet, I'm sure there are many others who need to keep quiet about equally fascinating stories for safety reasons.  Here's a snippet:   In 1979/80 my family took part in the biggest espionage scandal that the former country of East-Germany ever saw in its 50 years of existence.  If it had not been for a certain 15 minute period,  I would not be here to talk about these adventures.  These pages contain my version of our defection story, with links whenever I can find them.  Our story entails incredible stress, lots of intrigue, cloak and dagger missions and sometimes the most amazing coincidences. All of it sums up to the biggest slap in the face of the (former) East-German intelligence service.

						   This weekend was so great.  Absolutely exhausting, but great.  Much of it was spent with  urlLink MerE , preparing for her  urlLink birthday party  on Sunday.  We spent a lot of Saturday running all over the place, carrying loads of supplies to her place and preparing food.  On Sunday, we got to Centre Island about three hours earlier than anyone else, because we had to guard the spot and set things up a bit.  We spent a couple hours lying on a blanket under a tree and I read her stories (well, more like ramblings) by Lydia Davis and we had some good talks and periodically got up to chase the crazy flock of red-winged blackbirds away from our food.  So many people showed up that MerE knows from all over the place--work, school, online, old friends--and it was interesting to finally meet all these people I've been hearing stories about all year.  My lovely roommate, KP, also came and regaled us with a very funny pick-up story about an overly confident boy named Roberto whose opening line was "How you doin'?"  I should also note here that it is  still  Meredi's birthday week, all the way until Sunday, so she still has the last word on everything until then.  :)  Some things I've been thinking about:  1. Why is there such a stigma attached to anti-depressants and depression in general?  Is it because people are generally ignorant to the causes of it and how/if the medication works?  Is it just me, or is depression usually associated with those people who are downers all the time, super-whiny, the people who attempt suicide as an attention-getting thing?  And if someone attempts suicide to get attention, why is that less respectable than someone who attempts it because they sincerely want to die?  Do we think that the latter has a real problem and therefore merits compassion, while the former is just trying to be irritating?  Surely there is a solution for both people?  It's interesting, I've talked to a few people in the last couple of months who have been on anti-depressants for one reason or another, and they have all come out with something similar to the following sentiment: if you had heart trouble, you would take heart medication and people would freak out at you if you didn't.  Well, your brain is an organ too, and if it's not working, if it's starving for one chemical or another, you should take your medication and help it fix itself.  I find that hard to argue with, but I still find the thought of taking anti-depressants to be a frightening one.  I have read so many horror stories about side effects.  Then again, I have heard so many people tell me that if they knew they could feel this normal, they would have gone on them years earlier.  2. Why are so many girls on the pill when they know that they can take a shot of  urlLink DepoProvera  every three months and not get their period at all?  I don't know any girls who actually like bleeding, everyone complains about it, so what's the deal?  Do they actually like taking a pill every day?  Are they afraid of side effects too?  Or do they read sites like  urlLink this  and freak out?  3. Natural selection.  Every once in a while, myself or one of my friends will think about natural selection and think "bad thoughts" about how it probably should work in the human race.  In the wild, animals that are weak or slow or stupid die faster, and this is good for the species, because it means that those animals are less likely to breed and pass on faulty genetic codes.  In the human world, we take extra precautions to protect the weak and slow and stupid and sick and handicapped and alcoholic and mean and lazy people, allowing them to breed freely and pass on that genetic code.  Are we weakening our species?  Of course, what are we supposed to do, refuse them compassion, allow them to die?  I can't think that way, that couldn't be the answer.  Besides, something happens to people who work with sick or handicapped people, they become more relaxed and more compassionate and so many other things that I can't find the words for right now, and I love seeing that.  My friend S. has always said that she has a problem with the idea of heaven because she can't imagine being happy in a place with no handicapped people to hang out with.  I can't imagine being happy in a place with no people like S. to hang out with.  Okay, I promise to blog more,  urlLink certain people  have inquired as to my whereabouts.  I've been dating  urlLink Chris , and although he's a geek, sometimes he makes me get off the computer.  :)

						   Okay, so I just registered for my courses today and well it such a beautiful hot day out....no way do I want to be thinking about school right now! But that is okay,I got most of the courses I wanted and fit into my 'program plan', so that is good. I am only a half credit short and that is because I apparently am not allowed to take more than 7 political science classes. So that means I have to find something else to take, the thing is that I am a transfer student and all my transfer credits are used up in electives! So I thought I would take a sociology class as I have the prereq course and some of the offerings are really interesting such as the one I want into - The Criminal Justice System or Liberties, Rights and Proctections. So I have to wait until the soc majors get their pickings and then I will be allowed to register. So&nbsp; here are my courses for the year:  The Government and Politics of Canada International Relations Politics of the European Union Political Theory 1 Political Theory 2 Canadian Political Thought Political Analysis  I think I am most excited for the Canadian ones as well as the one about the European Union. They sound really interesting and I know my prof for the European Union course is a great guy so it should be a lot of fun. It will be a good year and now that I have a car, 9am lectures or seminars are much more welcoming!

						   If you want to know what I really like about linguistics, you should check out  urlLink Geoffrey Nunberg's pieces on NPR's  Fresh Air  .  He analyzes things like Kerry's and Bush's verbal tics, the evolution of swearing, blogging as a medium of language, etc.  Lots of good stuff.  His personal website is  urlLink here .  He teaches at Stanford at the Center for the Study of Language and Information.   urlLink Why Bad Beliefs Don't Die , an interesting article on the survival value of beliefs:  "[B]eliefs are designed to operate independent of sensory data. In fact,  the whole survival value of beliefs is based on their ability to persist in the face of contradictory evidence . Beliefs are not  supposed  to change easily or simply in response to disconfirming evidence. If they did, they would be virtually useless as tools for survival. Our caveman would not last long if his belief in potential dangers in the jungle evaporated every time his sensory information told him there was no immediate threat."    urlLink Share My World: A Photographic Study on Race and Perception :  I have taken the photograph of my face and degraded it on a photocopier. I created two sets of the same image; one with the article "a" and a space and the other with the article "the" and a space.  Over four years 400 photocopies were posted in Toronto Ontario, and Montreal Quebec.  The posters have been torn down, covered up, defaced, and written on.  Each response recorded stimuates the viewer to consider their own response to the/a black male.    urlLink This is not a war (it's love)  still cracks me up.  Secretly, Bush is in love with Chirac.  You can tell by the way they bicker and argue.  Oh Jason Kottke.  Such things make me love you.

						   Yesterday I went to Hamilton to hang out with some of my dad's side of the family for one of my aunt's and uncle's 40th wedding anniversary.  Two of my cousins brought their kids (we were at one of their houses), so we had seven little rugrats running around all day.  I had so much fun -- those kids are incredible.  Rachel (known as Cheech), who is "free" years old, spent about 3 hours climbing all over me.  "Dat gurl is like velcro," her Dutch grandfather (my uncle) informed me, "Zhe is attached to you for hours and den zhe will jump to de next person."  He turned out to be right, my mom got the joy of Cheech right after I did.  She was too cute, and wanted all the typical little girl things: hold me upside down, swing me around, lift me up so I can touch this thing that's high up, look at the sticker I found, look at my owie, tickle me, let me cuddle, let's go see what the boys are doing, again again again!  I'm in love.  :)  Now, Cheech is all smiles.  She's cute and she knows it, and she's very happy to see everyone and let them bask in the cuteness.  Her sister, Alissa (4/5?) is NOT all smiles for a very special reason.  Alissa is constantly laughing, has a great sense of humour, a super-strong personality, is smart as a whip, and is stubborn as all get out.  She also has  urlLink Moebius Syndrome .  From what I understand about Moebius so far, that means that the muscles in her face are  there , but the signals from her brain to move them either don't fire, or they aren't strong enough.  Because of this, Alissa can't smile, she can't raise her eyebrows, she can't close her lips without sucking in air.  She can't (easily) make the following sounds: [p, b, m, f, v].  (She substitutes [t, d, n, s, z], which is what I would have predicted from my Phonetics class, and she is easily understood because the sounds are close and they're used in context.)  Another muscle that is not working is the one that moves her eyes back and forth -- she can only move them up and down and has to move her head if she wants to look side to side.  She has a lazy eye, which rolls up (since it can't stray to the side) and she'll probably lose vision in it due to lack of use given another five years.  I didn't realise until this weekend how much we use facial expressions to communicate with people.  Sometimes we would tease her and she would look at us blankly (as usual) and we would wonder for a second if we had offended her, and then she would burst out laughing and we would heave a sigh of relief.  It's a strange thing to see a child laughing her ass off without smiling at all, let me tell you.  After spending a bit of time with her though, I could hear it in her voice that Alissa's got the same face as Cheech -- she's all smiles.  There's a doctor at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto who has been performing  urlLink this surgery  to help Moebius children get some semblance of a smile.  They transplant a muscle from the thigh to the face to allow the child to pull their cheeks back at all, which would be a huge help socially.  Can you imagine trying to make friends or get through a job interview without being able to smile at all?  This surgery sounds promising, but Alissa's dad said they're going to wait a bit, they don't think she's emotionally ready for it yet.  They have to do one side of the face at a time (so that the patient can sleep on the other side during healing), and it takes six weeks to physically recover and six months to see any results from the surgery.  That's a lot to undergo when you're five years old.  At one point in the afternoon, Alissa's dad said, "It's a good thing that we don't have four Alissas; we would be dead.  But I need at least one."  I'm glad to hear that he's so crazy about her, she's going to need a lot of support.  I'll try to visit them more -- it's been a long time since I've gotten to hang out with little kids and I had a blast.  :)

						   So this past week I directed an outdoors program where we slept in tents, cooked our own food and went on a big canoe trip (aka camped). It was a lot of fun. Even though it rained A LOT! But that is out we are hardcore and it is a lot of fun. I am super tired though. But good times, trying to canoe through a thunderstorm and then hiding out the bathrooms until the thunder and lightnening subsided. The kids were 10-12 and they were soo funny...crazy as anything but good all around.  So for my day off I went shopping and out for dinner with 2 boys(oohhh) and then we went and saw King Arthur. Apparently the rating on it is PG-13, and they were all these 8 year olds sitting behind us and they giggled so loudly during the sex scene, it was funny. Overall the movie was all right, the plot was mediorce and there was definetly not enough blood and decapitation. But overall it was all right. This week at camp it is a full house. I'm cooking for 100 people as well as planning for 2 incoming camps. Next week I have another Intents program to direct but for 12-14 year olds, it's going to be fun cause it is a full week! And it will rain, because everytime we do this, it rains. But it makes it exciting! Well it's time to go and put chicken burgers on for dinner!

						   So, I'm done my work contract for the summer now.  No more handbook-editing for me!  Apparantly York has a secret temp agency though, so I should be good to go for work for the rest of the summer, as I have excellent references here, and (let's be honest) I am the best. At everything. Yes, that too.  Ah, exaggeration.  There's nothing funnier than exaggeration and blatant lies.  Yesterday,  urlLink Chris  and I went to the  urlLink National Film Board's Mediathèque  and watched, among other things, a documentary from 1953 about 'Eskimos.' It was appalling, and it made me laugh*. The narrator obviously didn't know correct Inuktitut pronounciation, he mispronounced half of the main characters names, which drove me crazy. It means that I learned something in my Inuktitut class this year though, if only how to distinguish the "q" and "k" sounds. The "documentary" was quite appalling though, it was like watching a National Geographic movie about animals. They portrayed them as a primitive people who were already dependent on the white man for anything good in their lives -- here, take our welfare and superior food and superior religion and superior education and superior codes of family conduct... What? You didn't spank your children before you met white men? Well you'd damn well start, you crazy primitive people. Come to our school, we'll kidnap your kids, beat them if they speak their native language, destroy their culture, and give them back when they've assimilated into white culture.  There's a new Inuktitut movie coming out soon called  Inuuvunga ** and I want to see it.  If it's as good at  Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner , I'll be impressed.  *Why do I find things like that funny? Probably for the same reason that I find racist jokes funny -- they're just so absurd. I find it hard to believe that people are serious about such things.  **The Inuktitut word "inuk" (plural: "inuit") means 'alive' or 'human'. White people are called "qallunaat", which translates to something like "those with bushy eyebrows". They don't have a word for their own race, they're just human, which makes for a funny situation in government surveys. The question "Are you Inuit?" (as opposed to white, black, Asian, etc) is met with a puzzled stare and the response "Of course I'm human. Is this survey being answered by animals too?"  Inuuvunga  breaks down as 'inuk' (alive/human/not of a different race) + '-vunga' (we are).

						   How much do I want  urlLink this shirt ?  So much!  I started reading  Life of Pi  today (finished  The Ayn Rand Cult  at last!) and it is very good so far.  It's quite interesting, I've already finished the first section (there are three) and it has focussed mainly on the liberal faith of the main character (Pi).  Pi is an Indian Christian, Muslim, and Hindu.  He practices all three of the simultaneously and without any seeming contradictions in his mind.  This is interesting to me, because it's a look into how the liberal religious person approaches faith, something that I am quite unfamiliar with.  He has this to say about his atheist professor:   "I felt a kinship with him.  It was my first clue that atheists are my brothers and sisters of a different faith, and every word they speak speaks of faith.  Like me, they go as far as the legs of reason will carry them--and then they leap.  I'll be honest about it.  It is not atheists who get stuck in my craw, but agnostics.  Doubt is useful for a while.  We must all pass through the garden of Gethsemane.  If Christ played with doubt, so must we. If Christ spent an anguished night in prayer, if He burst out from the Cross, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" then surely we are also permitted doubt.  But we must move on.  To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation."   Personally, I have avoided the label  agnostic , not because I feel that I have everything figured out about reality and faith, but because I feel that it would be a cop-out.  I know many people who wouldn't mind my leaving the faith so much if I would just believe in God, even just nominally, but I really don't.  I'm not what they call a "hard atheist," one who rules out the possibility of there ever being anything remotely close to a God-like being.  It's just that I used to believe in the Christian God, and  only  the Christian God, and now I don't believe in Him anymore.  Sometimes atheists, in trying to explain themselves to theists, say something along the lines of "Explain to me why you don't believe in all of the multitudes of gods other than the one that you serve, and then you know why I don't believe in any.  I just believe in one less than you, we are not that different."  Personally, the word "god" doesn't really mean much to me anymore.  It's one of those words that I've used all my life and I have realised that I don't really have a concrete definition for it.  What could a god possibly  be , I wonder?  That said, I am starting to that think there is something to be said for liberal faith.  I think the liberal Christian probably has more in common with a liberal Muslim than she* does with a fundamentalist Christian.  I've never really understood the point of a faith if you don't believe that it's true the way that gravity or math is true (not even the way that history is true!), but maybe there is something to be said for people who will embrace only the parts of a religion that celebrate beauty and goodness and honesty and faithfulness.   *It came to my attention last year that philosophy papers have recently taken to referring to the infamous "they" ( on  in French) as "she."  They do this both to avoid the unnecessarily ugly "(s)he," and to try to make up for the hundreds of years where everyone was referred to as "he."  It really threw me off at first ("she?  who are they talking about?  surely it must be a specific person, or the author would have said "he"!), but I have decided that I like it.

						    urlLink Blindfolded boy plays incredibly complex themes of Super Mario Bros. on piano  (WMV), even supplies  urlLink sheet music .  I hate to say it, but I like this better than the  urlLink Group X  (Arabian Rap Sensations!) version.  Someday I will have a piano again, and that will be a happy day indeed.  Somehow I think the people living in adjacent apartments would kill me if I got a piano right now, especially if I spent my time learning to play Mario Bros. themes.  (But it would be worth it!)  :)

						   So, I've been at work for all of two hours (this after taking a five-day weekend), and I'm done pretty much everything.  Blah.  This sucks.  I hate getting paid to sit here and waste my time.  I would rather waste my time at home, where I have better music.  On the weekend: "So, tell us about yourself." "Well, I go to York for Linguistics--" "Oh yeah!  I've read your website!"  Very strange, I must say.  I have to beg a good portion of my friends to read my websites, and then I meet new people who are quite literally addicted to the Net and I'm frantically thinking, "Crap, what have I put up there?  What do you  know ??"  Good times, though.  Meredi and I went to an art show down at Nathan Phillips Square yesterday and we saw an artist that we saw at the One of a Kind show last fall.  I forget his name, he does these incredible paintings of empty overpasses and highways.  They're very good and it's strange, but they remind me of home, especially the ones of two-lane highways with fields as far as you can see on either side.  If we see him again, I'm going to stop and talk to him about them.  We also went to get some ice-cream at this place by the ROM, just like the first day that we hung out, but the shop had changed hands and the ice-cream wasn't really as good.  Last time we did that, we stopped in a park nearby and got yelled at by a homeless man who was drunk and very angry that we didn't have any "smokes" to give to him.  We didn't stop there this time.  :)  Also,  urlLink Steam Whistle  gets my stamp of approval.

						   At campfire last night I was sitting next to one of the leaders and one of his campers came by and said, "Can you hold this for me?" The counsellor being the nice guy that he is said, "Sure, what is it?." And he held out his hand as he said this and as the child is dropping his item into the outstretched palm he replied, "My tooth." The counsellor in shock still accpets the tooth as the kid proceeds to describe how he pulled it out. Too funny! Ahhh the reasons why I love camp!

The Possessed  by Fyodor Dostoevsky (accidentally skipped a chapter or two because whoever owned it before me had dog-eared the pages and I thought that their mark was my mark, and now I'm thoroughly confused and need to start over, which is frustrating because Fyodor takes a lot of work to read, dammit) 3.  A Prayer for Owen Meany  by John Irving (going on 2 years, here... it's good, I just can't stick with it for long) 4.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  by J.K.

						   Zora Neale Hurson's  Their Eyes Were Watching God  was the raciest book I read for a class at Bible College.  (I'm sure that class would have been vastly different if whoever looked over the syllabus had read all the books, it certainly wasn't the status quo at that particular institution.  Taught by  urlLink the lovely Sandra Sabatini , still the best teacher I've ever had.)  It's wonderful, I've read it a few times since taking that class (a study of the progression of the novel).  Hurston was an early American black feminist writer (1891&#150;1960) and she was revolutionary because her main characters were black women in the South and she was unapologetic about sex and black rights and women's rights.   Their Eyes Were Watching God  traces the life of Janie, a black woman from one of the first black-run towns, through three successive marriages (she leaves the first one, the second and third die) and her growing respect for herself.  The narration is in "proper" English and the dialogue is in dialect (e.g. "It's uh known fact, Pheoby, you got tuh  go  there tuh  know  there.  Yo' papa and yo' mama and nobody else can't tell yuh and show yuh. Two thing everybody's got tuh do fuh theyselves.  They got tuh go tuh God, and they got tuh find out about livin' fuh theyselves.").   urlLink Read an excerpt here.

						   Well it's been a while and I know you have all missed me!! (Well I can pretend right?) Anyways, here is a bit of an update on the adventures on my life.  Mouse Foetus Adventure: Well the mouse that I had attempted to rescue died. It didn't even make it through the day. It was sort of sad, but I am glad that I do not have to be taking care of it now. It is a lot of work! I went and bought all the food for it, like baby formula and such and then I had to feed it every 2 hours. So much work! I am totally glad that I am not parent! That is just a responsiblity that I do not need right now.  Jr. High: This week at camp is Jr. High (13-15 year olds) and to be honest it is my favourite age group because they try to be so cool and it usually backfires against them. And they are at the age where I can joke and be silly with them still. It's a lot of fun. The gorup of kids we have are an excellent group though. Lots of fun with them! We almost had to send one boy home and I am really glad we didn't. He is such a neat kid and really needs to be at camp because 'home' sucks, so I am so glad to be at camp getting to know kids and make a difference in their lives!  Monday Night: So a bunch of people have been praying for me to get a car, because as a full time student and a youth leader and living in a small city - public transit sucks and is time consuming. So on Monday during our staff bible study I asked the staff to pray all summer long that I would get a car because well I can't really afford to buy one and so God needed to just drop one on my lap.  So Monday after dinner I went for a run (cause I am trying to get in shape - laugh, it's okay). And as I am running back this car passes me and I thought to myself that the driver looked like my dad, but that wasn't our car. So I continue towards the camp and I see this car parked at the public beach and no one was around. I thought this was odd, but lots of people park and walk a trail that is nearby. So I continue to camp and come in the back  and join the kids at Vespers. My brother who is a camper this week informs me that my mom, dad and other brother are here to pick up my sister for her day off. So being the good daughter I am I went to go see my family and my dad says we need to talk so let's walk towards the beach. Now I am trying to figure out what he is going to talk about. So he tells me about his work and this lady who volunteers and how she thinks my dad is cool and does a good job. And so she had decided to give my dad her car because she is dying of cancer and cannot use it anymore. Which lead to my father giving it to me because I really needed one and my parents knew it would benefit me. So all I can say is that God is amazing! And WOW!! I am so overwhelmed! A car of my own!! It's a nice little sporty dodge neon, a 95 but it only has 60K on it and it is in good shape! It is going to be such a blessing to have that to do youth ministry come the fall! Woot!   The rest of the week: It has been busy, busy. I have been working 12hour days since Sunday, and yes that happens at camp. I haven't really gotten involved with the program because cooking and ordering have taken so much time!  But tonight I will be back in time for campfire so that is going to be fun! And Saturday is the Royal Rumble!! The last one for a while since the Jr. High program director is moving to PEI in Sept. She is soo awesome! She is 61 years old and has run our Jr. High program for the last 10 years! She doesn't look any older than 45 and is so neat! I hope that I am like her when I am 61!   So next week I am program directing an outdoors program for 10-12 olds and it is only 5 days instead of 7 which is good. I still need a female leader and a Bible Study leader, but I know God will provide so it's all good.   Well it is my day off and so I have a lot to do before I have to head back!

						   So, I took yesterday off because I'm coming to the end of my job and I don't have anything constructive to do until at least Friday (because I am SUPER-FAST), and this morning I called in and my boss said "Yeah, there's a couple things, but how about you come in on Monday and that would be fine."  Right.  Five-day weekend!  Still waiting to hear if Job #2 is actually in the works.  Right now I'm just finishing editing a formerly junky campy UGLY student handbook, which I have transformed into a beautiful clean professional-looking (and interesting!) student handbook.  There's another college on campus which somehow neglected to hire someone to edit their handbook, and for some odd reason they wanted to hire the girl who did ours last year.  That would have been a mistake for all involved, she just took the files from last year and added a few spelling errors so far as I can tell.  Anyways, she's graduated, so my boss is trying to secure me the job.  I'm pretty sure I have it (because, let's face it, I'm amazing compared to most half-assed summer students), I just have to wait for the administration to get moving... which always takes a while.  They're going to have to get it in gear pretty soon, September is creeping up on us and there are time-consuming things like printing to think about.  I have raved about The Best Roommate Ever, KP, on here before.  The other night, a friend of mine was over and we were watching a movie (12 Monkeys), and she came out and said, "Do you... want some tea?" and he looked shocked (tea? really? for me?) and accepted and then she went off to make said tea and he whispered, "You're RIGHT! She IS the best roommate ever!"  Verily, the way to climb the ladder of Roommate Perfection is to bring tea unbidden, something that KP does almost daily.  (Plus: incredible baking, entertaining stories, eclectic music and books, and the added bonus that she's cute.)

						   & she left him sleeping & left to stay i am staying by leaving she thot half smiling &nbsp; always i will be a memory to him better than i am now living with him and she went away half smiling or crying & couldn't remember his name  oh lady &nbsp; oh lady lately i am so full of that memory of you &nbsp; sick in bed i can dream of nothing else sick in bed it is your face i see before me &nbsp; always &nbsp; always as it was then  we remember that time we took you in & what happened then &nbsp; oh yes &nbsp; we do remember  -  journal , bpNichol, selected from pages two and three  Part of the reason I liked  journal  is that it has no punctuation.  There are no capitals, no periods, no commas, no exclamation points, no breaks between sentences at all.  There are basically no real sentences, just phrases and half-thoughts tumbling out.  He also plays around a lot with changing the narrator from "i" to "you" to "we" without really indicating it.  For example, he'll journal something about sex and about halfway through, the narrator will change from "i" (or "you") to "we," which is appropriate and lends more significance to it.  I also really liked the idea that someone who leaves abruptly leaves more of an impression on you, so in a sense they stay with you.  Which brings us to our next point:  There are all of these people who, when anyone talks to them about my uncle's suicide, they bring up demons and this story in the Bible where this kid was demon-possessed (seizures) and Jesus healed him by sending all the demons into this herd of pigs, who then stampeded over a cliff to their deaths, which I suppose set the demons free from the pigs?  I don't know, demons are (and always have been) a very weird subject.  Anyways, I have the following to say to people who bring this up:   WHAT?!   Hello, we are living in 2004 now and we know about depression, and we know about my uncle's depression specifically, and there are a billion factors and yes suicide is still unimaginable and a slap in the face and so utterly against whatever instincts humans still possess, but demons?!  This makes my immediate family angry, it does not help us in our grief to think that these mysterious beings took over him, drove him to madness, and in effect murdered him and that the faith that allows you to believe in demons doesn't require you to believe that God would go to bat for my oh-so-Christian uncle and protect him from something like that.  Of course, given Biblical books like  Job , where God did anything BUT go to bat for his "most faithful servant" (let alone his kids and servants, who get killed all over the place, just over a stupid BET), maybe it makes sense that you wouldn't trust God to protect you from anything but hell (which, may I note, is his own wrath, so he's really only protecting you from himself).  Anyways, I'm not meaning to go on a big ex-Christian rant here (blah blah blah, disclaimer to most of my readership and my co-blogger), but this kind of shit is pissing me off and it's hurting my (Christian!) father and that  really  pisses me off.  Maybe people are just trying to come up with an explanation and thinking that that sort of thing will help.  Well, it doesn't.  Saying "I don't know, I can't understand, but I will listen and I will grieve with you and let me know if there's anything you need"&#151;THAT would help.

						   So, I have officially transferred faculties (from Glendon, my bilingual faculty of yesteryear, to Arts where there are many more Linguistics courses) and I have received copious transfer credits because whoever assessed my file has obviously already completed  urlLink Wonderful 101 .  Somehow my background in History, English, Theology, and un petit peu de français gained me some Natural Science credits.  I'm not going to question it.  Anyways, this frees me up to take some FUN courses, and this year is going to be all fun and games for me, oh yes.  Here we go (only the interesting/useful course descriptions provided this time, my notes in brackets):  LING 2120 Fundamentals of Phonological Analysis (phoneme: the smallest meaning-carrying unit of a word -- i.e., the difference between /at/ and /pat/ is the phoneme "p") LING 2140 Fundamentals of Grammatical Analysis LING 2430 Language, Power and Persuasion: This course investigates the language of power and persuasion. The language used by powerful and powerless groups is analyzed to determine how it reinforces positions of dominance and subordination. The role of language in public persuasion is also considered.  (Do upper-class white males speak differently than lower-class black women because they have power over them?  Or do they have power over them because they speak differently?  Can you climb the social ladder by expanding your vocabulary and refining your accent?) LING 3160 Discourse Analysis: This course provides an analysis of spoken and written texts in context. Specific topics include spoken versus written discourse; the role of context in the interpretation of utterances; cohesion and coherence; and the relationship between information structuring and grammatical forms.  (This is where I learn to pick apart what people are saying, tell you a newspaper's bias in one paragraph or less, actually decipher politician-speak, etc.) LING 3120 Phonology LING 3140 Syntax SOSC 1900 Sexuality, Gender and Society: This course examines how the meaning and significance of sexuality, family, work and public life have varied historically for men and women. It is particularly concerned with analyzing the social definition and control of women and homosexuality, which has largely taken place in the interests of the dominant class of heterosexual “masculine” males.  (Internet course, which means that all my winter classes are Monday-Thursdays, 10:00-2:30.  Very sweet, indeed.) SOSC 2560 Ideology and Everyday Life: This course explores the crucial role that ideology plays in patterning and giving purpose to an individual's everyday life experiences. There are two case studies: one focuses on North America, the other examines Weimer Germany and the rise of Nazism.  (What do I love more than courses that combine a study of why we think the way we do, whether morals are relative, AND Nazis?  Frankly, not much!)

						    White Noise  by Don DeLillo has been one of my favourite books for about three years now.  It gets better everytime I read it.  The two main characters, Jack and Babette Gladney, have an assortment of children from various previous marriages, and they are both obsessed with the fear of death but unwilling to tell anyone about their fear, even each other.  There are several things in the book that act as white noise&#151;incessant advertising, the previously mentioned fear of death that casts its shadow on everything, the constant chatter and misunderstandings of family life, the mob mentality, and the pomp and circumstance that accompanies academic life (Jack is head of a university department of Hitler Studies).  You can read an excerpt of it  urlLink here  (on my other site), and if your name is  urlLink Meredi , I promise I'll remember to bring it over next time we hang out.  Honest.  Unless I forget.  Again.  :)  P.S. Is there a reason for the sudden drop-off of comments lately?  Was it something I said?  Did you guys go and do something foolish like getting a life?

						   For some reason I woke up at 4:30 (a mere 3 hours after I went to sleep) and couldn't get back to sleep.  So, I journalled for a while and wrote some stuff about  urlLink dealing with my uncle's suicide  and did some more code adjustments on my  urlLink other site .  Now the sun is coming up and I think I'm about ready to go back to bed.  I hate days like this.  In other news, this is how I feel on the bus where I'm often a foot taller than all the (Asian/Indian/Middle Eastern) girls:   ( urlLink Creatures in my Head )

						    urlLink Pen-spinning .  I can't really do it, but maybe with these INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS, I too will be able to geek out with the debate teams of the world.  Yet another reason why I love  urlLink discussions over at Metafilter .  My new favourite thing about NPR is their spot for Stanford linguist  urlLink Geoffrey Nunberg  on  urlLink Fresh Air .  (I'm going to put some of those shows on CDs for my dad for his long days of trucking.  It is my goal to fill his days with random information, books, and good music.  His CD player will be my classroom, oh yes.)  Nunberg is well-spoken and funny and very interesting.  He makes linguistics palatable and fascinating.  He's also chair of the usage panel of the  American Heritage Dictionary .  He's making me want to become a  urlLink lexicographer .  I added a new section to my personal website today&#151;a  urlLink Literature Anthology  to match my  urlLink Poetry Anthology .  Hopefully this recent burst of industry* will continue and it will actually become sizeable.  Things I need to read: more by Don DeLillo (because  White Noise  is in my top three books of all time),   urlLink Infinite Jest   by David Foster Wallace,  Crime and Punishment  by my dearest Fyodor,  Anna Karenina  by the lovely Leo Tolstoy,  Generation X  by Douglas Coupland, something else by Kurt Vonnegut (having already read  Slaughterhouse Five  and  Cat's Cradle ),  The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat  by Oliver Sacks,  The Unbearable Lightness of Being  by Milan Kundera,  Siddhartha  by Herman Hesse, and so many others.   *This weekend (four-day! w00t!), I have cleaned my room (big job! slobby no more! for a few days at least), redesigned my website, started searching in earnest for grad schools, completed Microserfs, done more reading of Age of Reason, started a Sociology textbook, read about the finer nuances of  urlLink punctuation , written Extremely Difficult Email (oh, what to do when the extended family tries to reconvert you to something even more fundamentalist than what you left), and caught up on sleep.  Sleep might not sound particularly industrious, but it is because I say so.  Also tried to navigate the tricky waters between friendship and dating, we'll see how that goes.

						   Happy Canada Day everyone!  Today is trying to decide whether it's going to be slightly cloudy or whether it's going to pour.  Hopefully it'll be clear tonight for the FIREWORKS.  :)  O Canada, O Canada, oh can A day go by without new authors springing To paint the native maple, and to plan More ways to set the selfsame  urlLink welkin  ringing?

						   This morning was a bit unusal. I woke up and was on my way to the bathroom when I saw a large pinkish thing on the floor. I thought it looked odd but thought it might be a giant clump of lint or something of the like. But as I got closer I noticed it moving, and the wind was not that strong. I bend down and notice it is a baby mouse - no fur and it's eyes aren't open so it really looks like a foetus. So I wake my mother up by saying "There's a mouse foetus on the floor!?!?" Now we had some decisions to make, kill it or try to raise it. Well right now I am in the process of trying to figure out how to get my hands on the these recommended  urlLink items.  So we shall see if I can handle the parenting challenges of a baby mouse foetus.

						   I went to the mall today and when I was about to leave, it was pouring out (of course, because this is  April  August), so I decided to get something to eat in hopes that the rain would stop before I wanted to leave again.  It's kind of funny, I know a lot of people who won't go to restaurants alone, they think it's kind of weird or boring or scary or something, but I kind of like it.  I don't do it often, but I certainly don't mind it.  I usually bring a book and/or a journal and get some productive thinking done.  Not only that, but I get the whole table to myself, so I get to spread right out, which is awesome.  Today the waitress gave me a quizzical look when I was waiting to be seated, she looked around me for more people, and said, "You want a table for...  one ?"  Yes ma'am, and bring me a coffee while you're at it.  I rather like being by myself.  If I learned anything about myself while living in residence, it's that I am an introvert, and as such, I relax by being alone.  My first year in residence, I had a lovely roommate for the first semester and she moved out for second semester.  While I loved her to little bits, it was so great to have the room to myself.  There's just something about being able to turn off the phone and lock the door and get away from everyone.  I don't like having to go to a library or a coffee shop in order to get alone time, those are public spaces and I'm still surrounded by people.  I find that if I don't have any time to myself, I get cranky and sick, I stop sleeping well and I get irritable.  Maybe that's why I like things like reading, puzzles, writing, and looking at art -- the solitary aspect of those activities keeps me sane.  Today my book of choice while dining alone was  urlLink  Nausea   by Jean Paul Sartre, in which Sartre introduced  urlLink his view of Existentialism  through the viewpoint of the main character, Roquentin.  It is a difficult book, especially because there is very little plot and Roquentin is such a weird guy, but it's well worth the read.  Basically, he is overwhelmed by this feeling that he calls the Nausea, where he is overwhelmed by the idea that things exist.  Their existence repels him, as does his own existence.  He feels that nothing should exist, that all of these existent things are in the way, are pushing at him and making him claustrophobic, pushing like  urlLink vomit surging into his throat .  Two excerpts:  p. 99&#150;100:  I jump up: it would be much better if I could only stop thinking.  Thoughts are the dullest things.  Duller than flesh.  They stretch out and there's no end to them and they leave a funny taste in the mouth.  Then there are words, inside the thoughts, unfinished words, a sketchy sentence which constantly returns: "I have to fi. . . I ex. . . Dead . . . M. de Roll is dead . . . I am not . . . I ex. . ." It goes, it goes . . . and there's no end to it.  It's worse than the rest because I feel responsible and have complicity in it.  For example, this sort of painful rumination:  I exist , I am the one who keeps it up.  I.  The body lives by itself, once it has begun.  But thought&#151; I  am the one who continues it, unrolls it.  I exist.  How serpentine is this feeling of existing&#151;I unwind it, slowly. . . . If I could keep myself from thinking!  I try, and succeed:  my head seems to fill with smoke . . . and then it starts again:  "Smoke . . . not to think . . . don't want to think . . . I think I don't want to think.  I mustn't think that I don't want to think.  Because that's still a thought."  Will there never be an end to it?  My thought is  me : that's why I can't stop.  I exist because I think . . . and I can't stop myself from thinking.  At this very moment&#151;it's frightful&#151;if I exist, it is because I am horrified at existing.   I am the one  who pulls myself from the nothingness to which I aspire: the hatred, the disgust of existing, there are as many ways to  make  myself exist, to thrust myself into existence.   p. 128&#150;129:  I, too, was  In the way .  Fortunately, I didn't feel it, although I realized it, but I was uncomfortable because I was afraid of feeling it (even now I am afraid&#151;afraid that it might catch me behind my head and lift me up like a wave).  I dreamed vaguely of killing myself to wipe out at least one of these superfluous lives.  But even my death would have been  In the way .   In the way , my corpse, my blood on these stones, between these plants, at the back of this smiling garden.  And the decomposed flesh would have been  In the way  in the earth which would receive my bones, at last, cleaned, stripped, peeled, proper and clean as teeth, it would have been  In the way : I was  In the way  for eternity.   It's not exactly the most cheerful book in the world, but I like it.  I feel like I'm actually getting somewhere with it, that I'm starting to understand the emotions that Sartre was trying to convey.  I don't know how useful the Existentialist perspective is, but I'm just starting to look into it.  I'd like to understand it if only because it is such a large movement, including Sartre, Heidegger, Kafka, Faulkner,  Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, so many huge thinkers.

						    urlLink The Language of Sex Positivity  is an interesting article about how the way we speak (or refuse to speak) about sex reveals our attitudes about it.     Sex-positivity changes the way we speak in several ways. For example, consider our choice of expletives. What do we call people we're angry at? Among other things, cunts, dicks, and assholes. Why don't we call them elbows or ears? Because there's nothing wrong with those body parts. Why is it that if something bad happens we say that we're fucked or screwed or that it sucks? If some part of us didn't believe there was something wrong with those actions and organs, we wouldn't use them in these ways; every time we use sex words as expletives, we are reinforcing our own internalized sex-negativity. Trying to use other words is quite difficult and can change how we think about sex words in some remarkably subtle ways. Another way our language changes through sex-positivity is being able to use accurate words. Only in the area of sex do we consider it better to use less accurate language. We use terms like “sleep with” or “mess around,” slang which doesn't actually tell us anything.   I've been thinking about this lately, as I continue to work through issues connected to leaving Christianity.  When I was living in residence at bible college, sometimes late-night girl-talk would turn to the issue of sex, but it was usually in the context of how to stop thinking about it or how to set limits in dating relationships in order to prevent premarital sex.  It was always a taboo thing, and spoken of as something that needed to be stopped, spoken of in general terms and never specifics.  It was seen as something that would be damaging to a dating relationship, for reasons that were always a bit mysterious to me.  A lot of the things in that article rang true for me, because I have spent most of my life in a community that speaks of sex in negative terms or avoids talking about it at all.  We were inundated with things like the  urlLink True Love Waits Campaign ,  urlLink Joshua Harris's  I Kissed Dating Goodbye  , and  urlLink XXXCHURCH .  I remember tons of youth group meetings and talks at camp or in chapel at bible college where the message was focused on the anti-premarital sex stance and trying to get the guys to stop looking at porn.  Of course, it was always assumed that the girls didn't really have a "problem" with lust or porn at all, sexual desire was limited to the boys.  *cough*  I think that contributed to the late-night conversations in residence about it too -- it was a rare girl who would admit that they  wanted  sex.  There was so much fear that the other girls would think you were deviant or sinful or disgusting -- and rightly so, because some of the girls  would  react that way, which reveals a lot about their own relationship with sex.  Anyways, that's my rant for the day.  It should make our text ads interesting for a while.  :)

						   I've been reading  urlLink Dana 's journal for a few years now and she makes me laugh until I cry.  This past week,  urlLink she learned how to knit  and it is nothing short of hilarious.  She is very silly and has no fear of going to a cute little knitting group with her best friend and swearing a lot.  An excerpt:   So, on the day the knitting urge seized me, I rushed off to an arts and crafts megastore near my house, filled with knitting bravado and the desire to learn.  I chose 4 balls of yarn (skiens? I'm just not sure), two sets of needles, text messaged and called some knitting friends with the hopes that someone could make some sense out of what I was supposed to be picking out.  I looked at books ("Yes, Even Someone As Stupid As YOU Can KNIT!!") and chose one with VERY LARGE PHOTOGRAPHS of people's hands holding yarn in impossible ways with the two needles all mixed in and again, with a blind confidence, I bought it all, and rushed home.   Another journal I enjoy quite a bit is that of  urlLink Mimi Smartypants .  I think if I went back and followed all of her links about various interpretations of 'self', I would have myself quite an education about that particular strand of philosophy.  An excerpt:   I find that people who seem overly impressed with the completely prosaic non-achievement of marrying and mothering are often victims of what I call the Videogame Approach To Life. Here I am on Level I! Got to land that prestigious job! Okay now quick, run over the cute cardiganed indie-rock boyfriend! You've lived together for a while, maybe it's time to get married! Spend some credits and buy a condo, you're doing great! You're onto the baby level! I can safely say that nothing cheeses me off more than this horrifyingly missing-the-point attitude toward "self-fulfillment," and that I consider it a major fucking problem in society, on a level with racism, sexism, and the description of foodstuffs as "flavor-blasted." And I am not talking about your garden-variety consumerism but something more insidious---a notion that your "self" is constructed by climbing up some fake ladder, a linear progression that ends in DEATH, people, lest we forget.  Okay that was unnecessary. Please tune in next entry when I am not so Tecate-soaked and when I am feeling more cheerful. There really should be a breathalyzer built into the keyboard.

						   First off, aren't you lucky? 3 posts from me in one day!  So this weekend a couple friends of mine are off on a road trip. We are going to stop in Toronto to go to Mountain Equipment Co-op, then off to Sudbury to se the big Nickel, now we are debating taking the 69 or going to Tobermory to take the Chi-Cheemaun Feery to Hwy 6, which would take us to Sudbury. Then we are visiting the camp I worked at last year. Then the next day we are driving to Huntsville to visit friends at another camp and then we are heading back to our camp. So we have a lot of driving to do in a very short amount of time. But it will be fun and it will be an awesome adventure!

						   So I got a car...and it was mentioned that I forgot to tell of how this came to be. It starts with the need...working as a youth leader in a small town with a crappy transit system, SUCKS. Anyways, I stared bringing it up places and so we had a whole lot of people praying that God would provide me with a car. My church was praying, the chrisitan education committee, my small group, and my youth group. I also work at a Christian camp and so the first full day of camp offically starting, during our bible study I asked if we could pray daily that God would provide me with a car. So we prayed.   That night I was out for a run along the shoreline road and was running back towards camp when this little car drove by me and I sort of noted it because of it's bright teal green colour and because the man driving it sort of looked like my father. As I was getting closer to camp, I see the car parked at the public beach. I think this is odd and continue on my way. I see the campers heading to Vespers so I cut in through the fence at the boat house and join them at Vespers, where my btrrother informs me that my parents are here to pick up my sister for her day off. I say ok and think I should go and see them because that is what a good daughter would do. I had failed to notice that it was not my sister's day off and why would my mom and dad and older brother come to pick her up?  So I see my dad and he starts talking with me and asking about school and my marks and then he starts talking to me about his job as we walk towards the public beach. I am trying to make him turn around so we don't disturb the campers at vespers. Meanwhile my mom and sister are following behind as well as my friends on staff. Anyways, my dad informs me that one of the volunteers at his work was dying and wanted to give my dad her car because she is really nice adn doesn't need it any more. So she gave my dad a 95 dodge neon with only 60K on it. So my dad gave it to me. So that is the story of how I got my car. It was kind of funny watching my friends watch me from the boat house, trying to see my reaction which was complete shock that I got a car. I was so overwhlemed. The staff was so extatic because God answered prayer so quickly for them. The lady who have my dad the car did end up dying not that long ago, which makes me sad because I wanted to go and thank her in person, but I did send her a thank-you card. I was just so amazed that someone could be so gernerous.  So now I have a car and am excited that I can go whenever I want and be very independent.

						   So this past week was Intents 2, a camp program my friend Ian and I designed to be independent of the main camp as well as focused more on the outdoors. This was the first time we got the age group we loved, the 12-14 year olds. They are wonderful because they are smart enough to have excellent conversations but obedient to do what you ask of them. This time we thought we would do a longer canoe trip because they are older and they could hack it. We originally take about a 2 hour canoe ride to  urlLink Selkirk Provincial Park.  But this time we thought we would be adventurous and try this  urlLink one.  Ian and Eleanor had driven to it and figured it was about an 8 hour canoe trip, which was reasonable with these kids. However, we had failed to do it ourselves and had no idea really where along the shoreline the park was.   So off we went Wednesday morning at 7am. At about 3pm, after 8 hours of canoeing, the kids were starting to get hungry and tired. We had taken 6 canoes, and so it had ended up that the 3 canoes with 3 people in it had rafted together and we had made sails (out of tarps and paddles) and we just sailing along. But the 3 canoes with only 2 people in each canoe had rafted together and were not doing so well. Those of us in the 'Viking Ship' had failed to realize who was left behind, Ian and R, the camper from hell. Not because he was a bad ass, but because we was extremely ANNOYING!! And Ian was the one out of all the leaders who had the hardest time delaing with him. As well as for the fact that the other 2 campers where the ones who gave R a hard time every move he made. It made for 2 very different experiences for the campers. Those in the Viking Ship (my canoe group) had a time of laughter and bonding, where the other group had a time of frustration, anger and tears.   Our canoe group thought since we had to stop for food and a rest we would head to this beautiful beach. Not too long, the other group caught up to us and had a rest as well. It was another Provincial Park called James N. Allan park. The only problem with it was that it was day use only and so we couldn't stay there. So we had a break, a swim and played some duck, duck, kill while I made some phone calls (yay for cell phones!) about whether or not we could stay there...but thanks to our wonderful government, you can't get a hold of anyone and then with our locaiton and the cell....we decided we better be off and searching.  So we canoed for 2 more hours and found a nice part of the shore where we pulled up and made dinner (yay freezed dried frenzy!) and slept and were up the next morning for a 5 hour paddle to Selkirk Provincial. We got there after lunch and spent the afternoon resting about and just having fun. Then the next day we canoed back to camp and treated the kids to a movie viewing of Pirates of the Carribean.  The week was really, really fun and the kids had a great time. It was awesome to do this camp with a bunch of leaders who are my friends. It went really smoothly and we had 2 days of sunshine!! A first for Intents camp!!!
