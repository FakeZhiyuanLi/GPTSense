                                    In the corporate world many people find themselves in a situation that requires them to share Workstations with other people. While this is easily done with windows XP, you have to be careful using the My File and My Documents folders.         &nbsp;        Unlike Linux, Windows was originally designed as a single user system and keeping your personal files personal takes a little extra thought. In Linux, your My Files or Home folder is inaccessible by anyone but the owner and the computer administrator. In Windows, you must save your sensitive documents under your profile (  usually c:/Documents and Settings/"your login here"  ), in order to be safe from prying eyes. Trying to store files anywhere else on the hard drive will leave them open to anyone who logs onto the computer.

      In a recent Cnet report. Cnet reported that Google may be coming out with a desktop search program and touched on how Google, an ad based company might do matching ads to the files on your computer.  While I will at some point have two cents to put in about the ads on my computer, right now I want to talk about Google as a company, a forecast if you will.  Several years ago, many people might remember, Netscape was quite the up and coming internet company. Netscape had the Internet Browser market cornered and was making a very big impression on the market. Netscape could have been the next big thing in computers and taken the market by 1997, if but for one thing.  In 1995 or so Netscape announced that it was going to enter the Operating system market. Stating that within the next couple of years it would have a working Operating System for x86 (IBM compatible) computers. (for those that don't know, MS Windows is an x86 based operating system)  Microsoft killed Netscape as competition through illegal market power and is still feeling the Justice Department squeeze since it lost that anti-trust case.  How does this fit in with Google? Easy.  In the near future, I don't think it will take more that a year after Google begins exchange stock in the public market, I see Google bringing even more software to the internet consumer. I see a Google Linux of sorts hitting the market.  I also see Microsoft falling.  Google, if it so choosed, could easily take the desktop OS market with a custom version of Linux. People love Google. People love Google so much that they even tolerate ads specifically targeted at their searches. NOW THAT'S LOVE!  With this love of Google in the Internet Market, Google could easily come out with its own version of Linux and put it on the market. Since it would be from Google, people would look past the unfamiliar Linux Operating System, and Install it over Windows faster the Microsoft can say "speed racer".  Other companies see the consumers love of Google, and would quickly begin making software and games for the Google OS. I even see Microsoft, giving in and making programs for it.   I see all this happening within the next 12 months or so.   While not official, I hear by pronounce; "Google Linux" this years Operating System of the Year.  Think about it,  It could come true before you realize it.  G. Romero (editor)

                                    Can anyone tell me why I even buy an anti-virus program?        &nbsp;        What do they do? Let's break it down.        &nbsp;        An antivirus program, such as Norton or McAffee, searches a users computer for things such as viruses, trojans, and worms. Every couple of hours it checks the Internet to see if there are any updates available. If there are, it downloads them and rescans the computer.        &nbsp;        While this makes since to most people, I truly don't understand. Is it not the Operating system writer that leaves the hole for a virus to come through? Why do we continue to see products like Mac OSX, Linux kernel 2.XX.X, Windows XP or Longhorn? Shouldn't we finish a product before we move on to the next level. Shouldn't an Operating System by "hacker proof" or "complete" before they move on to the next OS.        &nbsp;        Windows 98.        &nbsp;        Yes, the old faithful, Windows 98. While it had its share of problems and quirks, it was a leap ahead of ME, 2000, and XP in regards to security. Maleware writers had a much harder time writing viruses with this OS.         &nbsp;        The Big Question is; why did Microsoft even move beyond this OS when even it, while in our eyes is perfect, still held many errors and holes. Didn't Microsoft think to figure out how to fix these holes and making it more "hacker proof" before bringing out completely new code in a new OS..         &nbsp;        Hmm, I think I see something        &nbsp;        Mac OS9 - OSX        &nbsp;        While Mac OS 9 and OS X may not be the main stream OS, it certainly is a popular one with the graphics and medical professions. This Operating System almost seems completely out of reach of Maleware writers, I believe it doesn't get attacked like windows only because of a lack of interest in the OS as a whole and therefore not complete as a "hacker proof" OS.        &nbsp;        The Big Question is; I have a really hard time saying anything bad about Mac's OS's but with the recent release of security bugs found in OS X and up, one has to wonder whether Apple has their stuff together every time they upgrade their OS or if its just low usage of the OS that keeps it safe from attack.        &nbsp;        Linux/Unix        &nbsp;        While Unix is used in so many different industries, it tends to only be subject to direct attacks against certain companies. Why? We're not sure. Could be because if a person who knows Unix well enough to write a virus for it, usually is getting paid to maintain it.        &nbsp;        Now on the other hand is Linux. Linux is riddled with security holes.         &nbsp;        So what makes it different? Open Source does.        &nbsp;        With any Operating System, two things happen at the same time when a security hole is found. (1) Maleware writers quickly take advantage of the hole with viruses because the Company owning rights to the OS doesn't want or accept any advice or allow anyone to see the code and present possible solutions.. (2) The OS creator/company puts out a patch 30-90 days after the discovery of the hole, depending wholly on the Anti-Virus companies to protect the user until the correct answer can be found. But with Linux, when a new security whole is found, again two things happen but at different times. (1) Maleware writers and programmers put their heads together and find a solution to the problem and then submit it to the Linux Community. (2) the Linux community releases an updated kernel/Patch as quickly as possible.        &nbsp;        The Big Question is: Is it because of Open Source that Linux/Unix doesn't need anti-virus programs? No, not wholly, but close. It is the simple facts that as a computer programmer looking to do something with his mind, he can simply find a hole and fix it. With any other OS, the only thing a programmer can do is write a virus because he has no access to the source code and henceforth cant fix the problem.        &nbsp;        &nbsp;        What's the answer to the Anti-Virus cycle? Open source? No, we don't think so. But how about just finishing an Operating System before bringing it out and decreasing the need for Anti-Virus programs?

I am using this with out permission, but I would Highly recommend everyone checking out  WWW.PCMAG.COM/TIPS  for even more useful tips or even subscribe to there daily tips email.  Category: Windows 98/ME/2000/XP  Create Your Own Toolbars  You can make the Windows taskbar more useful by adding toolbars to it. Right-click on the taskbar and select Toolbars to see choices for several built-in toolbars, including Address, Desktop, and Quick Launch.  But perhaps the most interesting option is New Toolbar, which lets you create a toolbar to get fast access to any folder, file, or URL.  Among other uses, creating a personal toolbar can be helpful for immediate access to a particular group of files--if you're working on a long-term project, for example, and want one-click access to all the files or subfolders in the project directory.

      Book Title: urlLink Mythago Wood  
Book Author: urlLink Robert Holdstock  
Book Publisher: urlLink TOR BOOKS  
Hours spent reading: 10  
Other books by Author I have Read: None  
 From book cover:The mystery of Ryhope Wood, Britain's last fragment of primeval forest, consumed George Huxley's entire long life. Now, after his death, his sons have taken up his work. But what they discover is numinous and perilous beyond all expectation. 

 My thoughts: 
     What a wonderful book! Robert Holdstock must have met his very own mythago in coming up with this novel. 
     In a tale where Robin Hood and King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, come to real life. A man by the name of Steven falls in love with the one object his father coveted above all, a myth. A Mythago, the creation a myth into reality, created from Man's own subconscious with the power of the Wild Woods, changes Steven's life forever and brings him on a journey sure to put him into the myths of mankind's history himself. 
     Robert Holdstock could not have done a better job bringing such a unique and fresh story. This book is destined to be a classic Fantasy Novel in the years to come!  Spread the Word!! Mythago Wood!!

      Book Title: urlLink The Stepford Wives   

Book Author: urlLink Ira Levin   

Book Publisher: urlLink HarperTorch   

Hours spent reading: 3  

Other books by author I have read: None 

 From book cover: All the beautiful people live in the idyllic village of Stepford, Connecticut, an affluent suburban Eden populated with successful, satisfied hubbies and their beautiful, dutiful wives. For Joanna Eberhart, a recent arrival with her husband and two children, it all seems too perfect to be true - from the sweet accommodating Welcome Wagon lad to all those cheerful, friendly faces in the supermarket checkout lines. But just beneath the town's flawless surface, something is sordid and wrong - something abominable with roots in the local Men's Association. And it may already be too late for Joanna to save herself from being devoured by Stepford's hideous perfection. 


 My thoughts:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, I find myself reading a book by an author unknown to me. Ira Levin, to me, is one of the most poetic writers I have ever had the pleasure to read.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book starts a pace that is easy and&nbsp;comfortable. Its&nbsp;poetic cadence keeps you reading late into the night and wondering right along side Joanna; Just what is next. This book is well written and while I am not much for political undertones in my novel reading choice, This novel puts a humorous spin on a book that could have easily been changed to match La Fem Mystique.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one bad thing I found while reading this story was its inherent lack of a climax. Ira Levin has written such a well paced book that it keeps a constant rise to the final conflict, that a person reading the story almost misses its almost non-existent climax. You can start reading this book and before you know it, your reading the denouement, and the story is over.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the purpose of this WebLog is to review books I must take a moment and discuss the recently release movie, based upon the book of the same title. The move makes and attempt at bringing a Climax to the story and in the process kills the original story all together.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you ask me, Read the Book, Don't Watch the Movie!

      Book Title: urlLink Cities  
Book Author: urlLink Edited by Peter Croweth  
Book Publisher: urlLink PS Publishing  
Hours spent reading:8 (But I read it a second time for 5 hours) 13 total   
 From book cover:Paul Di Filippo, China Mieville, Michael Moorcock, and Geoff Ryman: in the realms of fantasy and science fiction, four names to conjure with. These award-winners are on any list of the most inventive, popular, and critically acclaimed talents writing in the genres today. Their original creations for this collection veer from surreal visions of the infinite to high-tech nightmare; from apocalyptic ruins stalked by heroes and vampires to a near-future where the aged terrorize the young. Paul Di Filippo is the author of Neutrino Drag, The Steampunk Trilogy and many other books. China Mieville is the bestselling author of Perdido Street Station and King Rat. The imagination of Michael Moorcock, author of more than eighty books, has fathered two of the most significant figures in fantasy writing: Jerry Cornelius and Elric. Geoff Ryman is the author of Was and the bestseller 253, among other books.  

 My thoughts: The book was incredible. A great collection of stories by authors new to me. I did have some questions on the third story like; What is the point? Where is this story going? Why did anyone bother putting this in such a good anthology?

 Over all I think anyone comming into the genre of Science Fiction and Fantasy should read this book. It is a classic example of the talent and worlds/characters a reader can find in the Sci-Fantasy genre can find.   READ IT!!

      Book Title: urlLink The War Of The Worlds  
Book Author: urlLink H.G. Wells  
Book Publisher: urlLink Del Rey Books  
Hours spent reading:3  
 From book cover: Martians invade Great Britain, laying waste to turn-of-the-century London. This tale of conquest by superior beings with superadvanced technology is so nightmarishly real that an adaptation by Orson Welles and the Mercury Theatre on the Air sent hundreds of impressionable listeners into panicked flight forty years after the story's original publication.

 My thoughts:  H.G. Wells uses a character that is by far too removed from his emotions and the events that take place right in front of his face. While Wells writes a compelling story, he should have told this story from a third person point of view, and even proves this with his shifting to another characters perspective almost forgetting the original character.

He by far, did a wonderful job of creating a story that feels plausible and strikes fear into the hearts of the readers, even if the dates are long past. It is incredibly smoothly written, even when jumping from one character to another, although he does tend to get lost when he does this.

      Book Title: urlLink The Time Machine  

Book Author: urlLink H.G. Wells  

Book Publisher: urlLink Delrey books  

Hours spent reading:3  


 From book cover:In the heart of Victorian England, an inquisitive gentleman known only as the Time Traveler constructs an elaborate invention that hurtles him hundreds of thousands of years into the future. There he finds himself in the violent center of the ultamat confilct between beings of light and creatures of darkness.


 My thoughts: This being the first time I've read anything by H.G. Wells, I was mortified to find how real this story felt. Wells' talent of only making the reader accept a little bit of unreality, and folds a story out of that one simple idea. Very few authors have been able to do so much without pushing the reader to the edge of unbelievablity.
 Political Undertones: I do not believe that Wells was going for a Political Writing when he sat down to write this book. I do believe that his feelings of the Upper/Lower caste system, of the time he wrote this book in, had a great impression on him. But one would be pushing the limits of their imagination to align this book with anything more than a romantic tale of adventure.
