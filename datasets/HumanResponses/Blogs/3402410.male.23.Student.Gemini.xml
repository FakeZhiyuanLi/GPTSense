      A line in a story:  Discover the most useless thing in life you can possibly do, then do it till you're really good.   An excerpt from a book:  Assume you write for an audience consisting solely of terminal patients. That is, after all, the case.... What could you say to a dying person that would not enrage by its triviality?

          The spring of my final year of high school I hit a girl. I punched her in the arm. It left a large bruise.    Everyday after school I would go to a café and drink nine coffees and smoke a pack of cigarettes. I went to an all boy school so the reason for the café had everything to do with meeting girls. The girls that would show up went to an all girl school. We had a dress code, they had a uniform; we showed up looking perfectly dishevelled with messy  I-don't-care-about-anything  hair, crooked, loose ties, shirts slightly untucked; they showed up in knee socks and quilts rolled up at the waist raising the hemlines to reveal more thigh than their mothers knew they had. It was a meeting of the over-privileged, under-challenged, horny teenagers. We smiled, we teased, we brooded, we laughed; we flirted.    One day a girl showed up that didn't look anything like the others: her skin was darker than everyone else's, she was shorter than everyone else, and her breasts were larger than everyone else's. She was exotic. Her father was a Jew from Morocco, her mother a pur laine Francophone from a working-class town in Northern Quebec. She was the first hardcore feminist I ever met. She indicted us boys for being the inheritors of a patriarchy she despised. We didn't even know what a patriarchy was. Our two primary interests were getting laid and getting stoned. This half-breed with the acid tongue was new to us and we hated her for it. Afternoons of flirting were replaced with afternoons of arguing. I was the most vocal arguer, and the most articulate. She and I were the most intelligent of the group, and the most willing to smash heads.    One day I actually won an argument. I'm not sure what it was about. But she started hitting me, lightly at first, punching and slapping my arms and chest. I don't think she lost her temper, I think it was more a kind of flirting than anything else. But as she kept swinging I kept telling her to stop and when that didn't work I started making fun of her. I said cruel things, made cutting observations about her personality. And then she did lose her temper, she started hitting me for real. I told her if she didn't stop hitting me I was going to hit her back. She told me I wasn't allowed to hit girls. I told her that if she wanted equality of the sexes than she was going to get it. Then I punched her. Once, in the arm. She screamed. She started crying. She got up and left. Everyone laughed, everyone thought it was funny.    The next day she came back, but didn't stay long. She stopped by just to show me the baseball-sized bruise I had left on her. Then she stormed out. I followed her. I apologized. We talked for a long time. And after that, we were good friends. She started to mellow out, she stopped verbally assaulting the inheritors of the patriarchy.    Later, during the summer, we started dating.    Fast forward to the winter. Maybe February. I guess we would have been dating for nine months or so. The relationship wasn't going well, we were constantly bickering -- and not about big things, like gender roles, but about little things, like her cats. I'm allergic to cats. Not very allergic to cats. But she had four cats, and her entire place was covered with fur. I would complain about the cats, she would tell me to take an antihistamine. I would, but was never comfortable in her place, I always felt slightly ill. We also argued about slightly bigger things than that. One time I was over at her place with a mutual friend of ours. We were in the backyard hanging out when she decided she was going to show our friend how to play the violin. Being allergic to her house, I stayed inside while they went in to fetch her instrument. I assumed they would be coming right back out, but moments later I heard the horrible screech of a violin in untrained hands. I went inside. She was standing on a chair, standing behind our friend, her arms were wrapped around him, her lips were right next to his ear, she was trying to show him how to hold the violin. We fought about it later, I told her she was all over him while she maintained she was innocent.    A week after this incident her mom went out of town for the weekend so I was able to stay over. As much as I didn't want to spend the night in her fur-lined house, the prospect of non-stop sex was enough to convince me otherwise. It was around midnight and we were getting ready for bed. I had been in the house for a few hours already and the antihistamine I had taken was wearing off. We had had another fight so the sex was out. I started sneezing, my eyes were bloodshot, I was feeling miserable. She started berating me for sneezing so much. I told her to stop adopting cats. I told her she was using pets (she also had two dogs) as a pathetic way to find some kind of emotional fulfillment the same way fat people get lonely and head to the fridge. It escalated from there. I was upset because we were fighting over stupidities and I was upset because I clearly wasn't going to be getting any action. Neither of us backed down, we were screaming at each other. She told me to go home. I should have gone home -- no sex, no cuddling, no fun at all, what reason did I have to stay? My pride was hurt though, I was actually being thrown out of someone's home -- my girlfriend's no less -- so I refused to go. She started pushing me towards the door but she couldn't budge me. I was at least a foot taller than her, I wasn't going anywhere. Then I lost my temper. I picked her up and threw her across the room. Thankfully she landed safely on the couch. But the deed was done, I had crossed a line. She started crying, she started hyperventilating. I had won the power struggle. She looked so helpless sitting on the couch. I went to comfort her. Her cheeks red with tears, she looked up at me and in a soft voice said, "Please Jeff, just go." I felt sick, I felt like I was going to vomit. She wasn't screaming at me to leave anymore, her venom was gone; she was instead softly pleading for me to go. I left. I was devastated. I was unable to believe what I had done. I went home.    More than two years later I found myself at a rough punk rock bar. I got very drunk. Some creep started hitting on a girl in my group of friends. She told him to go away and he did. But he kept coming back. As we were leaving he pinned her to a wall. My friends and I quickly ripped him off her. We left, we walked down the street. About a block away from the bar the creep started screaming at us. We should have just kept walking, we should have ignored him. Actually, that's precisely what everyone did, except for me. I turned around and started screaming back at him. My friends kept walking, I was standing alone when he started running at me. Pretty soon fists were flying. I got in a few punches but they didn't seem to affect him at all. A buddy of his joined in. Before long I was on the ground and they were both kicking me. I remember wondering where my glasses were, hoping they weren't broken. Thankfully the police showed up and pulled them off of me. One of the cops let me go get my glasses, they were in the middle of the street. Nobody got arrested, they just gave us a talking to and let us go. I caught up with my friends. They didn't realize what had happened, they were a block away in a coffee shop waiting for me.    I caught a cab home with a friend. I didn't have any money so I only went as far as his place. I walked the rest of the way home. In the cabbie's rear-view mirror I checked myself out and I didn't seem to be in too bad shape, considering what had happened. I was just a bit scuffed up, and there was some dried blood underneath my left ear, but all-in-all I didn't look too bad.     I was almost home when I started crying. It caught me by surprise. It wasn't the physical pain -- I was still very drunk after all. I started talking out loud, I kept saying, "I'm sorry" over and over. She had forgiven me the day after I threw her. We made up, we had a long talk that spanned several hours. We had excellent make-up sex. We dated for another eight months. Battered and bruised, I resolved that night to call her and apologize again, though I never did. The next day I woke up with a black eye and a swollen knee. I actually started a new job that same day -- thankfully my boss was a nice guy and didn't figure me for the type of guy who got into bar fights on a regular basis. He sent me home and told me to come back in for training in a couple days when I was feeling better.    I still see this ex-girlfriend around sometimes. We never talk -- every time I spot her I head in the opposite direction. I bumped into her at a bar a few days ago though, we actually talked for a few minutes. She said she would come around to my table later and hang out for a bit. I convinced the people I was with to leave, and we did so immediately.

      Well shit, I've been blogging for over a year now. How 'bout that? July 15 marked my one year anniversary -- I had meant to mark the occasion somehow, but in my head my one year of blogging started in August. Oops.   Anyway, I've scrapped Movable Type, my dear sweet web publishing system. The company that makes it stopped supporting free upgrades, essentially abandoning the community of users that made it so darned popular in the first place. They also closed the help forums for non-paying users. I could no longer get the help I needed as I was making site changes. Was more trouble than it was worth in the end. I'm using Blogger now. Unfortunately I can't (or can't figure out how to) import my MT entries. Rather than pretend they never existed, I've made them available for now and forever -- the old archives still look kinda screwed up though, I'll get around to fixing them eventually.   See the old site here:  urlLink grumblegrumble.ca/movabletypearchive/    And read the archives here:  urlLink grumblegrumble.ca/movabletypearchive/archives.html

      Today spent studying, head in books, reading up till final hour, wrote exam, good feeling, done done done. Good or bad I don't care it's finished, one less thing to worry about.   After emptying my head onto paper I feel a need for something else, some physicality. The body needs to release itself too. There are two things that spring to mind: hardcore drinking or hardcore fucking. I got no one to fuck and don't feel like hitting on the easy white trash. I don't got booze but I could get booze, just down the street here's my money thank you very much come again, but no, no, I have an assignment due tomorrow, gotta do that instead.   But I can't sit still, there's an unreleased energy that requires massive consumption, I need to make my head dizzy with sex and drugs, to feel something not just think something. Argh, this sucks.   It's a good thing I'm not as amoral as I'd like to be or else I'd turn into a cokehead serial rapist come exam time.    UPDATE 30 Minutes Later    Found a box chocolates in the kitchen. Playing Tetris on my Gameboy whilst shoving my face full of delicious (plus a couple tall glasses of milk) and listening to  urlLink Forward  by the Thermals on repeat seems to have been all the stimulation my body required.   I'll just do that instead of making a rape joke next time.

      My house was built in the 1960's. The front door is heavy and strong, and it has two small windows made of thick, blurred glass. You can't buy a door like it anymore, though one day, imaginably, it will need to be replaced considering that it is constantly exposed to the elements. Any "modern" door will look out of place within the outside facade of the house. In terms of craftmanship, there is nothing exceptional about the door, it is not difficult to build. Regardless, doors are not built like it anymore. And while a carpenter could be contracted to fashion a copy, the cost would be prohibitive to the majority of home owners.   Business idea: speciality, "old-school" door manufacturer. Limited mass-production of a dozen or so models would keep the price of new "old" doors down while at the same time offer a fair facsimile to the original designs. As well as the aesthetic function of replacing the rotting, dated doors, providing modern insulation with a classic design would be another selling point. The most difficult part would be distribution, convincing hardware stores to sell the product. Perhaps it could start as a catalogue item.  Why do thoughts like this pass through my head? Who the fuck cares??? Apparently I do. Thoughts like this one pass through my head all the time.

      The problem with going to bed with a couple of Pogues albums is that before long I'm gulping Scotch -- though it should be Jameson -- and wanting to do some Celtic moshing.  Memory: When I was younger I went with my father to Whistler, he was invited to speak at a conference, and in the mornings I would order room service and watch this Irish soap opera before hitting the slopes. I fell in love with a girl with large, impossibly black eyes and hair to match. I resolved to go to Ireland and marry her. I think I was 14 or 15 years old.  FYI: There's a great site called  urlLink Poguetry  that thoroughly explains all the references made in MacGowan's lyrics. For example, the "Jocks" from this post's title may refer to the Scots, who are sometimes called jocks, or it may refer to Arabs, "as a shortened form of camel jockey." It's a very extensive site.

       I am unhappy and it is neither my fault nor that of my life.   I'm at the end of things and before the beginning of things -- the semester expires in four days, I'm off to Newfoundland on Friday, and school starts again in September. I'm in a state of mild panic.  The usuals suspects are holding court in the top of my skull.   Namely,  What am I doing in school?  and,  What am I doing with my life?  When I wasn't in school I was anxious about wasting my time, wasting my life. Now that I'm in school I feel the same way.  I hate emotions. I don't know what to  do  with them. I should be proud of what I've done in the last year. I've always been a horrible student, and this past year -- while not exceptional -- is certainly unprecedented in my academic career. I suppose I am proud of myself. A B+ average for a guy who got expelled for failing seven of his seven classes his second semester at college. When the going got tough, I used to get drunk. Now I stay up all night and actually finish my work. And  then  get drunk.  But it's not like I've discovered a new me. I'm the same. I'm just as restless as I ever was. I have fantasies of disappearing in the middle of the night, leaving without a note. Maybe join the army, maybe join a monastery. Maybe hitchhike down to Columbia, maybe walk to Winnipeg. Maybe something else.  This is going to sound terribly pretentious, but I think what I need is a life's work .  A  passion .   I am consciously avoiding investing my pent up passion in people. That hurts too fucking much. I want my relationships with people to be less intense, less all-consuming. I'll take my five blocks of personal space thank-you very much. What does that leave though? A thing, an object of interest. A hobby? I have hobbies though. No, something bigger than a hobby. A life's work. But what?  So people, what's your life's work? What's your passion? I want to know. If you don't have a passion, is it a problem? Or are you just too busy with life to notice?

      I'm exhausted. Went to the tennis, went out and talked a lot. Got very little sleep last night. Yet I'm still awake. I'm so hip: Friday night, alone at home surfing the web while thinking,  Go to bed you cad! Sleep, sleep! You're tired!  Yet I continue to surf.  Been taking quizzes at OkCupid -- a site made by the same two guys who created The Spark. I took the personality test and apparently I'm The Loverboy. Check it out:   "Well-liked. Well-established. You are The Loverboy. Loverboys thrive in committed, steady relationships--as opposed to, say, Playboys, who want sex without too much attachment.  You've had many relationships and nearly all of them have been successful. You're a nice guy, you know the ropes, and even if you can be a little hasty with decisions, most girls think of you as a total catch. Your hastiness comes off as spontaneity most of the time anyhow, making you especially popular in your circle of friends, too.  You know not to make the typical Loverboy mistake of choosing someone who appreciates your good humor and popularity, but who offers nothing in return. You belong with someone outgoing, independent, and creative. Otherwise, you'll get bored. And then instead of surprising her with flowers or a practical joke, you'll surprise her by leaving."  A flattering assesment of myself I think.  urlLink Take the quiz yourself if ya like . Some other quizzes I took:  urlLink The Virgin Game  (you have to look at pics of folks and guess if they're virgins or not), the  urlLink Geek Culture Test  (I'm "mildy geeky"), and the  urlLink Kinkyness Test  (I'm "pretty kinky"). My username is TheRedWave if you wanna spy my results.

      Didn't get to see Myskina play. I went during the day, she played at night. Tickets are expensive, and during the day I was able to see three matches, while the night only had one. I did watch her on TV though (so, I did get to see her play, just not in person). Actually, I did see her in person on the practice courts. She was looking very pretty.  Of course, she's also just as funny looking as ever.      I'm pretty funny looking too though. Clearly we belong together.       Tidbit: three of the four semifinalists at this year's tournament are Russian. FYI: This is due to the fact that Boris Yeltsin is a tennis nut, and when he was in power he put lots of money into developing young talent. Another tidbit: 6 of the top-ranked 15 women tennis players are Russian, while only 3 are American. (The Cold War still rages on inside my head, evidently. Go Sputnik!)

      Montreal's annual tennis tournament, the Rogers Cup, is on right now. Guess who's playing tonight? My girl Myskina! Guess who got tickets? My dad. Guess who he invited? Me! Guess who can't go because he's got class? You guessed it. I should just skip. But I won't. I'm a good boy. Fuck. I'm an idiot boy.  And my dad gets great fucking tickets. They're corporate tickets, which usually means front row. I would be a few feet away from my future bride! I'm quivering.  Another reason to learn Russian: it will greatly help me achieve my life's greatest ambition: to woo and marry Anastasia Myskina.       Replace the tennis ball with a skull, she could be playing Hamlet. She so perty.

      I enjoy classical music. I'm always meaning to go to the symphony. But never do. I've also been planning on going to the  urlLink Musée des beaux-arts . Apparently the permanent collection is impressive. Regardless, I never end up going.  I have not been sleeping well. The moment my head hits the pillow I seem to wake up. Midnight, last night, I was exhausted. I went to bed. I laid awake for an hour before giving up.  Meaning to go to the symphony and to museums may seem like a silly contrivance to appear  cultured . Do I want to do these things because I enjoy them or because I want to tell -- and impress -- people (and write about 'em on my blog)? To be honest, probably both.  So I was awake late last night. I didn't read my book because I was supposed to be reading a book for school but I don't like the book I'm reading for school so I  couldn't  read  my  book because I'd feel too guilty. It would have been cheating on the other book and I loathe infidelity. Though when school work is out of the way I do enjoy an open relationship with the three or four books I'm usually reading at one time.  So what did I do? Well, I had forgotten about the newest cd to fall into my filthy hands. I put on headphones, then put on the music. Then played some chess. The music I was listening to was frantic, dishevelled classical. The chess I played was online. Online chess. I play on Yahoo! Games. I got soundly thumped a few times. Frantic, dishevelled classical is my favourite kind of classical. It helps me be the tortured soul I've always longed to appear to be.  I read a book, for school, last week. It was filled with big words, so many big words, that I gave up looking them all up. Here are two words that followed each other in the book:  scrofulous excrescences . What the hell does that mean? I looked them up at the time but now I forget. Let me look them up again.   scrofulous:  morally corrupt  excrescence:  an ugly addition  Let's see if I can use them in a sentence.  The judge, a suspected Klan member, has never ruled in favour of a minority and is currently under investigation for his scrofulous behaviour.  and  The mouldy chesterfield proved an excrescence to the room.  I think I'd prefer to use more words to simply say what I mean rather than  obfuscate  obscure or confuse my meaning with words that less people understand.  I come across the word  verisimilitude  fairly often in my reading, yet for the life of me I can never remember what it means. I must have looked it up at least a dozen times.  While I was playing chess I was listening to the frantic, dishevelled violins, and thinking about going on a trip over Christmas with my drug money. Of course, I have never actually participated in a medical trial. A couple good sources have assured me that they are really very safe. I think I will probably go through with it. I can only go do it in September however -- I'll be too busy until then. So, I was getting thumped at chess, half-listening to the violins, and thinking about where I'd like to go. Then it occurred to me: Moscow.  It occured to me because I'm enrolled in an introductory Russian class this coming semester. Everyone I tell this to responds with an incredulous look and the mandatory question,  Why would you want to learn Russian?  To be honest, I'm not really sure. Ostensibly to read books in a language other than English. You would think I would just improve my French. I like the stereotypes of Russians though, much better than the French. Cold, unfeeling, (sexy, vampire-like) pale. The first Russian book I read I bought based solely on the title:  The Life of a Useless Man . The book was pretty good too. Russians know how to name things: War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, Dead Souls. Also: I like saying Russian city names: Volgograd, Novgorod, Tynda, Kursk, Sochi. Try it, say all those names out loud. It's fun.  Unfortunately the length of my Christmas break is a bit of a crap shoot. Last day of class is December 7. The exam period is from December 8 to December 23. Exam schedules get posted in early November, I think. Class begins again January 3. A plane ticket to Russia (according to  urlLink aircanada.com  at this very moment) runs nearly $2,000. That much money just to get there and back, I'd want to spend more than ten days. If I get the exam schedule I want I could potentially stay three and a half weeks.  Everything is moot. I will end up dropping my Russian class, not participating in medical trials, and will visit my grandparents in Ottawa for Christmas. I'll still suck at chess, and never go to the symphony or museums. I will never remember the meanings of the words I look up. And I will always have trouble sleeping.

      In anticipation of the money I'll soon be rolling in (due to my new found commitment to the proper testing of new drugs) I participated in a bit of last fall's Mail Order Madness. You'll recall I purchased upwards of fifty compact discs during that period. I attributed it to trying to fill the void in my life with material possessions. However, what I failed to highlight at the time is the fact that I'm a total shop-a-holic.  For example, I own four copies of Suzanne Vega's album Solitude Standing on the original 12" vinyl. Why? Well, I inherited one of them. The other three? Well, each time I'm in a record shop and find this gem I tend to buy it, despite the knowledge that I already own it. I mean, it's usually only like $3.99 or something, how can I say no? Surely I'll come across pretty ladies in the future who will be unfamiliar with Tom's Diner and so I'll be a generous devil and give them each a copy. Of course, these pretty ladies will need a turntable. I am only romantically interested in women who own turntables however. And I like to think that any pretty lady I meet who has a turntable already owns Solitude Standing. And if they don't, well, I'll be frank: their prettiness gets demoted to kinda cuteness. And hell, the album isn't really all that great. Of course Tom's Diner is fantastic, and who doesn't love Luka? I even have time for a couple other songs. But as an album -- as a total  thing --  it stinks. No, I keep buying this album because the  idea  of Suzanne Vega is actually cooler than her music.  (Clearly I need my own radio show. Six people would listen, but these six people will be the coolest cats ever to enjoy FM.)  So I did K Records a favour tonight and bought quite a few CDs from them. How many? I don't want to talk about it.  Okay, I'm about to go somewhere else with this post. Let's get a new title going on.    Scream on: Part II      I owe someone a mix-cd. I've decided to make it the last mix-cd I ever make. The process, or I should say  my  process, is a long and arduous one. I end up listening to almost every single cd I own, getting frustrated, and eventually just slapping random songs on a disc that have no business being together. The don't-try try. If I actually attempt to make a great compilation, the amount of sweat and tears I put into it completely dwarfs any of the enjoyment obtained by the listener. They will never understand what these songs mean to me. And because of that "crime" of theirs I end up harbouring resentment. How could anyone not love something as much as I do? I refuse to recommend anything to anyone ever again. And after this mix is complete, no more forever. I'm keeping everything I love to myself. Nobody can hurt it there.

      Have you ever participated in a clinical trial? I just got off the phone with a company here in Montreal that pumps volunteers full of drugs, takes blood, gives 'em cash, and sends 'em on their way.   Okay. I shouldn't be so vulgar. They are testing generic drugs versus name brand stuff. Sounds safe -- not like I'd be a guinea pig for anything radical. I'd have to stay overnight. One of the trials coming up is in late August. I would check-in Friday at 7:30pm and leave Monday morning. It's like sleep-away camp! They will take my blood 15 times during that time. And take urine samples. So I guess it's not like sleep-away camp. Which is fine, I hate camp. I figure I can get some homework done.   Oh yeah, did I mention that I will be paid $900 for "volunteering"? Booya.   Unfortunately I can't do it. I'm going to be out of town. They said I should call back when I return.   I met someone a few weeks ago who has been supporting himself for a long time doing this. He has characterized the experience as emotionally draining and degrading. But it pays his rent.   It's important to keep one's eye on the prize. I could finance a trip to Paris with my drug money. Christmas in Paris, by myself, crying over a bottle of wine? To be alone is one thing. To be alone in Paris is quite another. And I'll have track marks all over my arms, I could tell people I'm a junkie. Oh, the glamour!   If you think this is a bad idea now would be a good time to pipe up.
