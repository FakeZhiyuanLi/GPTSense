      so today was a pretty shitty day... alex would not listen to me at all.  told me he didn't like me and that he'd rather have steph as their babysitter.  had to take the kids to island oasis, it was fun but i got burnt.  i don't know, just a long day.  all i was really looking forward to tonight was to talk to John, but obviously I fucked that up.  I don't even know what I did.  I seriously just want to break down and cry the shit out of me right now.  I don't know what my problem is, or John's.  I don't even know who has the problem, but it sucks.  So, i think i'll go to bed, have a good cry, maybe feel a little sorry for myself and try to figure out how to get rid of this razor burn. Night!

      Ok, SOMEONE has been on my ass to write on here, so here it is.&nbsp; I went to Lincoln this weekend to see a piano concert.&nbsp; So i was watching my aunt and uncle, and I was like Wow, they're really in love!&nbsp; And then I thought, I hope i end up marrying someone that I'm like that with.&nbsp; Because they have no kids, so nothing to really keep them interested besides themselves.&nbsp; It's just you and them, day in and day out.&nbsp; And I think now matter how much you love the person that could still be really hard, and it seems like they always find new interesting things to discuss, and I really want that.&nbsp; Because after the kids are gone, it's just you and him, and nothing else.&nbsp; Well, that's not all that true, because you have grandkids to keep you busy, but still.&nbsp; So tonight&nbsp; JP was talking about how he wants kids and stuff, and I simply told him that i thought he was damn near perfection, but i don't think he took me seriously though, BUT I WAS DAMNIT!&nbsp; I had fun drawing pictures tonight... A lot of it, I hope i didn't hurt any feelings, that would suck.&nbsp; Check ya later!

      Spent another night not being able to sleep again... Just a lot of shit on my mind I guess.  I don't know, everything's just so damn confusing.  Oh well, I guess as Aunt Mae says on Spidey 2, sometimes you just can't have the thing you want the most, gotta be responsible.  BUT DAMNIT I'M 17 YEARS OLD, I DON'T NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE.  Haha, anyway, I think we're going to Grandpa harley's for brunch.  EGG CASSEROLE!!! WOOHOO!!! yes, my favorite... it shall be glorious.  Later

      Tonight was a pretty uneventful night.  Downloaded some music, read a little, went to Clay's to make a cd.  I'm just in a really depressing mood.  I don't really know why... could be pms i guess...  I wish i wasn't so stupid.  It seems like people just get sick of me.  I don't know, guess I'm too loud or dramatic or something... even John isn't talking to me. I'm just really emotional right now.  Like on the way home from Clay's i was listening to 94.5 The Breeze (That's easy listening for all you non central Nebraskans) and God Must've Spent a Little MOre time on you came on.  The N Sync version!  not the Alabama one, and i started crying!  Why?? I do not know, probably because I don't have anyone to feel that way about, or if i do there's no chance and it would never work.  Atleast my cd's good, but my computer's retarded and wouldn't let me burn a cd.  Clay has a nice computer.  He also had a picture up of him and Sal and it was really cute.  I don't know how long it'll be before they go out.  The have the Tucker/Becka thing from flash forward going on, but i think it's the whole "don't wanna ruin the friendship" thing.  I honestly believe that their friendship is strong enough to last no matter what.  Hell, I remember in 1st grade when he came up and kissed her on the lips.  Yeah, I was a little jealous.  But anyway, his computer was fast and was able to git er done.  Well I think i'll go, John kinda disappeared 20 minutes ago, so i probably won't end up talking to him tonight but oh well, such is life.

      Okay, so i went to Chav's summer league game tonight, and i actually got kinda excited for school.  I know, i'm retarded.  Tonight at the game some hampton chicks were walking in front of us and started talking shit RIGHT INFRONT OF US.  They were talking about how cool we thought we were and i was just like yeah, we're not cool, but we know it so we don't try to be cool, and that makes us cool... if that makes any sense.  but anyway, they just kept talking and finally moyer really loud just yells Bitch!  and the turn around and really snotily say, "oh sorry, guess we didn't see you there."  Yeah, we were a little pissed, but then figured if we were from hampton we'd be that fucked up too.  I really want to play on the slip n slide.... like reallllllllllly bad.  maybe i'll do that tomorrow because the slip n slide is cool, and obviously i think that i'm cool, so i'm gonna do it.  Yeah, that excited me.  Speaking of excitement, tonight i got home from the game around 10:45, Chris is gone, Julia's gone, i go into my parents room to tell them i'm home AND THEY'RE FUCKING!  They thought i was spending thenight at sav's tonight.  I guess all the power to them though.  That love making is the same love making that made me.  So good for them!  Anyway, I'm going to go, because I want to talk to John.  Have a good evening!

      Hello Everyone!  This is my very own blog and I am quite proud of it.  I told John I wouldn't let him see it, but I probably will, just because he let me see his.  Yep, he's a crazy guy.  I didn't really mean for the address to be crazyassmofopoop, but i was trying stuff out and that worked.  I CAN'T BELIEVE NO ONE HAD THAT NAME YET!  SHEESH!  But yeah, i'll probably write later when I feel like it.  Adios!
