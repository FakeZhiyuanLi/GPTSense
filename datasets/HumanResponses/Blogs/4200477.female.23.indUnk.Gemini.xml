       Waaaaaaaaaah!!! i'm so pooped! Just went to a dermatologist awhile ago and had my face checked. I dunno what happened to my face but some lil' zits appeared last friday and until now it's still there. I'm so stressed during the weekend. So stressed that i went shopping!!! Hahahha...Anyway, then the doc' told me that it was bcoz of the facial wash im using so i have allergies. My skin is so sensitive daw that i cannot use any products i want. Oh well...sorry na lng sa mga facial wash products, dear i cannot use it anymore. Anyway, the doc' gave me 2 types of medicine for my uber sensitive skin and it costs a lot. And now i'm sooooo poooor and kawawa. Huhuhuhuhu! =,( Oh well...even if it cost me a lot who cares it's my skin! Ü so vain....Harhar! ;)         Next top model…   I watched the ‘America’s Next Top Model in Studio 23’ last Saturday and hell the girls are really great! Some are pretty and potential model material but the others are really NOT.  I’m rooting for the 3 girls (my bet of course!) which really look as the ‘next top model’. Hopefully they could win! Ü  I just love watching girls parading their beauties and talents.  If only I was given the ‘height’ I will surely join such contests. Hahahaha! …*just wishful thinking*            Wish Me Luck*    Have a job interview & exam tomorrow! hope i could answer all the questions right. M nervous coz i hate exams but then if the price is right (i mean the offer!Ü) of course i'll try and give my very best. Haaaay...its so tiring to 'job hunt' but then if ur really looking for the 'greener pastuer' and if ur tired being the 'company slave' then by all means go and look for the so-called better management. I hope there's one who will hire me. hahahahaha..plugging..peeps in the HRD. Ü      Oh well...i'm tired so i rest my case for now.
