      the bt2 is over. b4 it i tot i can do well for maths and physics, but now i tink i cannot get A. so then therefore my projected grades for bt2 is BCOF C5, for maths physics econs chem respectively. chem is damn headache. i will dig it after i do econs. i tink actually i dun deserve a for maths and physics cos i slack too much in june. maybe next time i will so better. but first must relac. after tmr chem maybe will go out play or go sing song. sad that i have no stock at home though.

      today went kwok hse about 2 or 3. joseph was there and we tok cock do werk for a while. den tingfeng arrive and bring chicken rice. i no have because i came too late. den kwokz help me cook dumpling which his sister made. ate 4. tingfeng is kwokz friend from bp and pjc. he is friendly and tok abit about the pjc. den joseph had to go tuition. it was about 5. den do werk den tingfeng had to go cos its his sister birthday. den left me and kwokz den do werk den go eat den go up do more werk den i go home. i had managed to complete 3/4 of charged particles today. today is fun and productive but oso disappointing. i am disappointed because the canto song i tot i learn until pro liao actually i alot pronounce wrongly. tmd. must slowly ask kwokz and joseph for the right pronounciations.  my right mouse button is spoilt. it is quite troublesome. but i dun plan on getting a new one...maybe after ns get a new com. den will have mouse.

      yesterday went to bh hse for bbq. bh live in park west which is near clementi mrt which is oso last time i go there play cos my cousin oso live there. its a class bbq and is quite fun cos got quite many pple go and cos after eating we go play ping pang. i oso go and try chang which we buy cos its the cheapest...$12 sumting for 6 cans. my ping pang is quite lousy but nvm cos we are not very pro one. after dat we go and play squash cos the indians very friendly and lend us their rackets. its my 1st time playing and i tot its quite hard to hit...but now i noe why. cos i fan fire and i play ping pang so my wrist very strain liao and now i noe cos i woke up my wrist quite suan.   today actually supposed to go temple wif my relatives cos its my grandfathers death anniversary. budden i cannot wake up when my mother try to wake me up and i feel abit guilty cos i am one of my grandfathers most favoured grandsons. budden on the other hand i cannot dig my aunties and mothers mentality...they are like those kind of stupid aunties that will kena con by magic stone. they say of buddhism until like its damn power or wat... say tings like if ur very sick and about to die den keep chanting buddhism chants and u will get well. wtf. can u dig dat. dats y i abit reluctant to go temple one...budden really is i cannot wake up. religion is one thing i really cannot dig. how can u believe that there is such ting as god; buddha or whatever nonsense. i tink religion is just to tell u to like do the right thing or sumting but pple like my aunties and like the muslim terrorists interpret it differently and i beleieve wrongly oso.  this weekend is busy cos tmr still got 4g gathering...which surely will be fun. i tink so therefore i must study today to i tink can do well in physics and maths

      today is last day of bt. it is chem. i tot i sure F cos i nv touch chem. but after today i tink maybe i can get O. after chem we go ktv. the sam refuse to go den go out wif singh dunno go where. at the ktv got me kwokz bryan hanzi and shin leng. later got the jo ruying chiki and serene got come oso. sing song is fun. the most pro is kwokz. i tink his best songs are 真的愛你, 長城, and 屋頂 although he got many other songs pro and i 4got oso. the gers except shin leng dun really dare to sing. dats abit sian but maybe is their 1st time sing song or cos they are ger den they shy. but actually its nothing much cos as jo pointed out even hanzi oso abit shy to sing. my 真的愛你 sian lah abit screwed up though i am quite familiar wif the song. but i tink i noe where the mistake is liao...maybe next time try again summore got the coupon. den we go far east. met the yinghao there. den after walk around abit den go home.  today shin leng told me something that make me think about for quite some time. she told me dun discriminate gers. i tink i really quite discriminate gers but i cant help it and got reasons. 1. gers are very troublesome. cannot do this cannot do dat. wan to do dis wan to do dat. 2. i keep tinking dat gers are like very insincere like very manipulative like very backstabber liddat. of course dis may not be correct budden from wat i c i cant help having dis kind of impression. 3.i tink gers are very humprey. this makes them irritating to deal wif and more importantly is bad influence to me as i myself is learning to be less humprey. 4. i come from boys school and cant really deal wif gers. summore its like got no common interests liddat. 5. i very scared gers cry. 6. im sexist. 7. i tink gers are like selfish and like self centred like always think they are right liddat  aiyah sian lah but since i dun tink im gay i have to deal wif gers...maybe like after ns or sumting lah.

      this few days i have be sick and many things happen. one thing is the service learning day. on thursday my class go margerat drive special school for service learning and we work wif autistic kids. i have learn more about autism and i learn there are 3 areas autism affects are imagination socialation and 1 more. while interacting wif them i can see this like they are oblivious to their surroundings and pple around them. no imagination is like they cannot play wif a toy properly, they may just turn the toy upside down and spin it for example. so play wif the kids for a while then we are supposed to design toys /learning material for them. is damn sian cos its damn long like 4 hrs and i not feeling well. den end the day.  another ting dat happen is the soccer. the soccer interhse loyfat 2 v staff if win den win liao. budden the loyfat cannot win and the staff is quite good wif chiongsters like leonard ong and  older teachers but still can play like stanley ong. den come to penalties and staff sure win cos roland is keeper and he is mind games. so have 2 play 1 more match on frida cos the staff cannot be crownded champions. so is loyfat2 v gomes 1. gomes 1 is quite good wif pple like zhaoyuan and the indian. both sides had chances budden in the end end 0-0. penalties and gomes 1 win   5-4. quite unbelievable cos j1 team can win a j2 team wif so many soccer players and malays inside. budden the loyfat pple dun care they just play for fun one so nvm.  den another thing is that our karaok plans were foiled so many times sibei lame. the 1st time is wed. wed we go out play lan, den after dat wan sing karaok and ask jo and kwok come out. budden in the end it is screwed cos of ladies nite out. den the next day service learning day after dat is a good opportunity to go budden i am not feeling well and cos i am too indispensible in singing so they oso nv go. den got after friday after reflections got soccer i got watch and they got play and after dat we can going out and we go jurong east eat after dat go jec kbox budden the package cannot use on fridays, so foiled again. den we go clementi and finally can sing. den today is saturday and earlier is go kwok hse ate steamboat. quite fun lah eat den sing and talk.
