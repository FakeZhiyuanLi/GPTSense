      Posted by: lunchbox benny   Fri 08/22 03:12 so i'm learning that you have to suffer for your art, and you have to have it taken away from you before you can fully understand it's overall importance. you got to get pissed and pushed till you do it with a new found conviction. that's the only way it will live. i'm off track with the world today, everything seems greek to me i can't grasp a breath. i let people down by being down. somedays it's too much to carry and i get too wore down to fake it or remain professional, in that i let myself down if not others. the lesson to be learned is when you're hot you're hot and when you're not you're not. you have to prove what you got when you're not so hot. the chips are down. do you have the balls to follow through, or will you be remembered best for giving up? it's no fun sitting on the bench, coach. i wanted to sleep today untill i got an email that i never got i'm starting to wonder if elvis is dead, i wonder if he's okay, safe, i even went to omaha.com to see if he was dead. people don't fall off the face of the earth. a kid wants my band to play space odity, i'm considering, though were not playing anything right now so we'll see, he's gonna have to find someone else to play the dio song. that's far too 80's for my ass. few people believe in me they will be rewarded for that one day, in abundance. it's time to make more money the baby dream is crying, would you kill your own child insted of watching them starve to death? would you ever let your kids watch you drink? in between your moister baths and velvet facial lotions? alot of people are afraid to say what they want, that's why they don't get what they want. i didn't mean to lose control. i didn't intend to suffocate these possibilities. i will be something then nothing then something then nothing eventually. I DON'T GIVE UP--------------------------------------------------I BLOW UP

      Posted by: lunchbox benny   Thu 08/21 02:09  austin's was pissed when johny was cool, now austin's cool and johny's mia. hopefully a ufo has him or a hot bitch has him tied up at knife-point, or his computers down. hopefully this isn't the last of elvis. i have a feeling he's joined another band, i feel evaded, i feel your emptyness, i smell the withdrawal. i should shut my big fat mouth for once. TOO MUCH, TOO SOON elvis breakin hearts since 1954 and still breaking them tonight aug20.2003

      Posted by: lunchbox benny   Wed 08/20 03:06 what are metal heads so pissed about, and why does it all come down to pain, blood, death, and violence? maybe i just don't understand. i love to roll with the rock, and i think we're more about fuckin' then fighting. thats the difference between rock n' roll and metal i guess. i guess if houston ever gets tierd of kickin everyone's ass, he should visit our side and have a good time, things are alot more friendlier over here. all we want to do is shake some ass. and is it me or is everyone conforming to a hardcore attemt of exceptance??? money talks and people listen and everyone's on the make. there's a bag of lies and a world of skeahmmerz welcome into the ring. it's amazing what a devoted french ass kisser can accomplish in the bizzz. i should have been born without a gag reflex. then i would "be somebody" for sure. to swim in the seas of success you have to swallow. i've always been one to suck it and smile:)- i played cards with boomboom tonight, he taught me a tough game so i taught him a stupid one. a $2 deck of cards is worth it. then i was fortunate enough to hang out with buck bowen, he's fuckin cool, i didn't say much to him he's more fucked up then me! he's extremely talented and fuckin crazy too, i think we'll be good friends. plus his hair has a hard on, that's cool to. well tonights the night. is elvis in the house? just a thorn on the side L-U-V you best believe B-E-N-N-Y

      Posted by: lunchbox benny   Tue 08/19 14:39 keith isn't in my band anymore. full blown rose isn't having a backing vocalist. prom songs the war years is. that's a different situation. and from my last time of working with a girl in a band. it became more about nailing the band then the songs. it's the truth. and i'm not saying anyone is wrong for what they do as long as they learn from it. and what if learned sex fucks up bands. i'm still trying to get things set up for a longer time then it takes to get someones pants off. not to say that you couldn't be professional, just saying i'm not taking the chance. i thought i had contacted some one who wanted to be professional not a school girl with crushes for motivation. not a good day to throw anything in my face hr. find me on a better day and we'll talk more about it. just a thorn on the side L-U-V you best believe B-E-N-N-Y

      Posted by: lunchbox benny   Tue 08/19 09:59 so once again i go too far, or at least with the wrong people. i was just kiddin around, everytime i thought it was dead other parties brought it back up. i thought if austin was upset we would have heard from him earlier, i was wrong. i also didn't think he'd be so pissed. this message board is for being bored. and i use it to see how people react, what intreeges, none of it really matters were just losers at computers, most of us with hidden identities, and too many opinions. i figure if im gonna draw attention, i'd like to only name people i think deserve the attention. i wouldn't ever talk about gto's asses. that's all that gets noticed. sorry if i brought too much attention to people who trusted me... but realize who you're trusting.... drug abusers, vampires. and attention whores. anyway i learn alot still everyday. but i'm not kissing anymore ass, i fucked up i layed my side of it, and my appoligies on the table if it still isn't better then my power is only destroying things. and helping them fall apart. just a thorn on the side L-U-V you best believe B-E-N-N-Y

      Posted by: lunchbox benny   Mon 08/18 03:59 why is it when you care about someone ( friends parents, band members, lovers anyone ) and you're honest about it with them. they become so distant they become invisable. why is it when you speak the truth they shut the door, claim you were never there, and ignore your pounding at the door."pipe down kid, we're trying to sell this. don't fuck it up, for the rest of us." are we that accustomed to lies, are these the habbits we form from believeing in bunnys santa and god."we can't translate truth, we can't handle it, you're asking too much again. don't make me face that. we only know how to fake it, why do you have to bring love into this, i can't hear passion. i don't see your point, just shut up for christ's sake." it's my own fault, i run in excess with everything. i was never about small doses. sorry if i'm over the top, i thought that's what you ordered, oh my bad, over easy, i'll send these back. i didn't know you were looking for hootie to bore your life to death. our silence will not save us. being quiet, being pollite was never very helpful. i'll just take my luggage to the next terminal. why is it when kids stop me in the bowling alley they don't have anything to talk about after hey. i assume they're thinking i won't reply, so they're never prepaired, i'm not good at talking face to face with people, probably cause i don't talk to people much. this internet thing is pertty kewl. i'm fond of email especially from johNy who i haven't heard from. b.c.s. his internet isn't working right now. practice wed i hope. drag if we don't. the chambers are empty, it's safe again.

      Posted by: lunchbox benny   Sat 08/16 04:00  it doesn't take much. a little bit of graciousness, benevolent words, common sense, and to know who you are dealing with, and to know who they are dealing with. some day this will matter, and yes i can see that it is starting to, too. you see you do have the power to turn enormous things around. i knew you had it in you. enjoy it while you can, take my adVICE - from experience - you don't know what you've got till it's gone. it's a good day to stay calm (from the one who's always worried)

      Posted by: lunchbox benny Fri 08/15 03:15 fuck 7up! i don't know if you're aware but they now offer us 7upside down.....with caffine! i've forgotten alot in my life but, i remember this black dude on a carabiene island, he promised me caffine....never had it never will. one more lie told to me. i know the original is still available but i respected them for not useing addiction to hawk thier goods. i've been burning cd's non-stop for full blown rose and prom songs the war years. i got in touch with my inner man (not like that kids) i had to change a deadbolt lock those things suck. do you have a drug problem if you have drugs and don't share them. or is hordeing your stash smart. the only drug problem i have is not having enough. and what about rehab. that cost thousands of dollars. if you can come up with thousands of dollars, you don't have a drug problem. lunchbox benny never had an extra two hundred bucks....never will.

      Posted by: lunchbox benny Mon 08/11 03:12 it's a full moon tonight. i'm glad i'm not around any hard core dope fiends. i'm sure people are short fused. though i'm kinda lonely. i miss my friends, guess they've had thier fill for now. i'm trying to get in touch with the Ivory Star gang i really miss them. i haven't talked with my family in a long time. they're pissed i played a show vs my uncles funeral. but they haven't understood me for about ten years so what's to talk about. i'm considering getting a new line up of prom songs the war years. i really love those songs. i was listenin' to old recordings. not a one i'd play for anyone in the bunch. my voice has changed so much, i'd really like to have another shot at performing those songs right and getting a decent live recording or good quallity demo of the songs before i let go. though i only want to play a show every 3-4 months. that allows me to get really talented (busy) musicians involved i've mentioned it to a local guitarist we all know, he considering. if so i'll need to find 2nd guitar and an accoustic player and a female backing vocalist. i'm not gonna drag the project out forever. i just want some shows, recordings. i can go back to (and be proud of) when i miss the tunes, i think i formed too close of relationships with the songs. my main focus is full blown rose, things are alright i have a good-strong feeling about the guitar players. don't wanna jinx it though. we'll see....gary coleman's running for govener. i think the whole gary coleman has a posse thing really went to his head. a little black guy vs the wieght lifting terminater media won't shut up about so i will. be good to yourseves wherever you are. just a thorn on the side L-U-V you best believe B-E-N-N-Y

      Posted by: lunchbox benny Sat 08/09 02:20 tonight was the last show with chris, it was kinda rough in my eyes. i was really into it the last few songs. an appropriate last show, full of technical difficulties, very humon, very honest. you look at the band members and you can sense how they honestly feel at the time. that's way cooler to me than playing perfect shows. though the crowd's input was very possitive. regaurdless of how i saw the show, everyone was real impressed. by morning some jerk will be on the message board draggin our name in the mud. fuck them. hidden email cowards. as my best friend keith's lyrics say "spineless suckers &amp; jealous motherfuckers"

      Post By:  urlLink lunchbox benny  Wed 09/17 02:57 realization is the town i'm hanging in now, having people i needed at a point that weren't down for the trip kinda forced me to go, without them in the car. on the trip i learn to let go of what i've clung so desperately to. i see that i don't have to have this one person riding along with me, the car drives the same without them. and there are others more worthy of being invited, and being appriciated by me, others who can value it without feeling compremised. if you can't feel the importance and the fire in your being then i can't give it to you, no matter what i negociate or contract in blood, there will always be one or the other or the new above me on the charts. so i start going through the record books, i'm reveiwing things, i'm learning, i'm shedding things i thought i'd always wear. i can see who loses on the deal, i see what's impossible of me to ask, because hearts don't take requests not even for favorite songs. hearts play what they want, and you can't expect anything else from them. i find it's time to let go of the things that just don't make sense. i am discovering that we're kinda wasting each others time on the grand scale of things the goal the big dream we just don't make sense, too many innevitables and it's kinda silly to fight for a space in someones life when you're never gonna be the right fit to complete them. it's sad so many perfect things beautiful things precious things comfortable things in the fimmiliarness you would think it was ment to be. but you learn you'll never be enough to complete. so it's time to set the ones you love free. cause holding them in a spotlight of unrealitty isn't gonna work out five years from now. the chemistry is there but you can feel that it's not the right people and anchors. so in this letting go we let go of our demands and requests. we're not waiting by the phone, we're not about convienence. the slurpee machine is broke and 7-11 dosen't want to be open right now believe it or not. alot of this is from watching actions or lack of them. i didn't cut the cord, i didn't set up walls. someone thought it'd be better to hit the reset on the nes. so things get deleted forgotten ignored. and i follow that lead. and i know it's time for the show, i know it's do or die, in all this disconnection i smell what's over the hill. and i can't change hearts. but i can deliver, and i will make you know that i will pass any car on this one lane highway, it's not being promised it's getting set on the table you can touch it now. it's not just an idea. i think i want you to give full time, you can only give part time, but i'm at a point where i couldn't occupy you full time so i settle for part time with you, and some day that will take me to point where i do need full time and that's where our road splits, and sad as it is, it's very honest, so there's no room to be upset. and there's a calmness on the sea tonight and i don't want to make waves. i just want to see the sunset, don't say a word, don't touch the paddles, i'm pointing in the perfect direction to take this in and the calmness is feeling right, the air is crisp and clear, after all these battles over the last year i've found a sense of being enough, and i gave it to me. thanks to you pushing, dropping, driving me in the right directions. but it was me who gave it to me. and i know i'm alone in this travle. i'm okay with it. yes i'm sad youre not in the photograph of now and you'll be absent in the newer memories, but sadness aside it what feels right. and i take what i can get and i make the best out of it i can, and i graduate, and i go to a different collage, we still have holidays. losing cozy friends from your day to day life to aquaintences these things happen. and you can not cling. you hold onto nothing. and the friendship is there i can sense it. i know nothing of the past was wasted and to this point it does make sense. and i want to keep things ideal in vision and mind. and i sit with this cozy friend, i laugh with them i share secrets with them. and today is perfect i have everyone close and heart felt and i have all my vices and favorite flavors around me, and good people watching out for me. the money isn't there but being happy with life myself the discisions. and where i stand. soon the sun will set someone will make waves and then i'll be one my way to a new town. but for now i am breathing in every fiber into my soul and i let it make it's tatto on my heart.  "Each one of us, in his timidity, has a limit beyond which he is outraged. It is inevitable that he who by concentrated application has extended this limit for himself, should arouse the resentment of those who have accepted conventions which, since accepted by all, require no initiative of application. And this resentment generally takes the form of meaningless laughter or of criticism, if not persecution. But this apparent violation is preferable to the monstrous habits condoned by etiquette and estheticism."

      Post By:  urlLink I, Pistol  Mon 09/15 19:37 so one time, when my name and hair was short, i was sitting in my bedroom listening to good for nothin rock n' roll, and my mom walks into the room and thinks she smells marijauna. well as a matter of fact she did smell marijuana. and the pothead that i was i had left my bag sitting right next to the records. she grabbed it and flushed it down the toilet. at this point neither one of us were doing to much of listening to the other so i got up and left. i went to my friend's house and got another bag. i went home after a few hours, and when i walked in to the house what did i find. right there in the living room was my mother and right next to here was my father, and my sister, and my neighbors, my cousins, and my teacher. do ya know who else was there......... my minister. he came walking up to me with a bible in each hand, just in case he broke one, remember who he's dealing with. and he says "do you know why i'm here boy?" and i said " well i suppose you want me to stop smoking marijuana." he said "NO! i want you to smoke mmmmore marijauna, i want you drown in a sea of liquor, then i want you to wash up on beach made of cocaine, i want you to take acid and fist fuck the prom queen right after fist fuckin the prom king." i said reverend, "what are you saying?" he told me "son, there's alot of good things about drugs, in fact there's alot of GREAT things about drugs, but son there's one bad thing about drugs." i said "you mean like costing too much and running out of them?" he said "NO those are givens like morning wood and jerking off. but there's one really bad thing about drugs. drugs will turn an asshole into a SUPER asshole. and you know what i'm talking about. we've all had that friend that gets so fucked up that you can't get fucked up because you have to babysit thier stupid ass. you know the same friend who will puke in your car and expect you to clean it up. some people don't need one more of your beers, they don't need one more of your joints, and they don't need any more of your cocaine, and they sure as fuck don't need to borrow money that they'll never pay back. all they really need is someone to clean them off the floor. don't ever become that asshole son." You've got a whole lot of trouble Running in your veins Say it right here and right now You give drugs a bad name So why just hit him When you can hang him high Why just make them sweat When you can watch them die If you'd have faced the world You could have had it all Now your back's up against That same damn dirty wall Every place you live Turns out the same You passed your last buck You give drugs a bad name You give drugs a bad name You give drugs a bad name baby Now a cool person knows When the party ends Besides some of us just might wanna get invited back here again So pick yourself up off that bathroom floor Take whatever pill helps you find the door For all the people you just let down You can pay us back by never coming 'round And until that day, that'll never be Just don't tell anyone you came here with me You give drugs a bad name You give drugs a bad name You give drugs a bad name Baby yeah yeah yeah Drugs got a bad enough name as it is benny   Y_O_U_R____N_A_M_E____I_N____L_I_G_H_T_S      Y_O_U____T_A_S_T_E____T_H_E_____F_E_A_R     "i give drugs a bad name"-lunchbox benny         I, Pistol,benny

      Post By:  urlLink lunchbox benny  Mon 09/08 07:01 it's about the dissappointment of when a close friend betrays you or you betray them and you don't know why it's falling apart but there's that sense of loss and you just can't go back. i tried to figure it out, i said okay we're two people who can have a conversation yet i can't catch the tail of this kite. we'd look at each other and try to have a conversation but then it couldn't resolve it. it just can't be resolved right now. people come in and out of your life. sometimes for a day sometimes for longer and all of them make you what you are. you can't separate these people out of you. they form who you are, even the ones that you kind of think well i don't know if i want to be formed by them anymore. but you are in some way. you are. maybe that's why you don't have to look at them so harshly because they have affected you. at the end though it's us as individuals. and we learn that soul mates come and go, but you're never alone. even when it's just you and your shoes, you carry them with you. i'm at a place now where i relize that love is a bit complicated and it's not just about a fantasy that you have of somebody and so it's all kinda involved and complicated because it's not a cut and dry kind of idea. it's not that i don't like this person it's not that simple i think you might be really very taken by somebody and they might be very much in your life but there's things that they do that are quite disrespectful or cross a line in a way that is very passive aggressive so you can't really talk about it. manipulation makes me cry especially when it's with people you supposedly are close with. you see covert activity you would think would come from the outside forces, not the inner circle. sometimes you don't have to spend alot of time with somebody to have exchanged alot of yourself and taken away parts of them that become a part of your body map, that sort of become written, or tattoed on you. in some way and it can't be seen visably but it's felt internally. carbon is a kid i know he only wants to be a maid he comes to see me he's carbon made. there is a brillance to carbon though, as there is a brillance to a diamond. but people chip away and chip away and chip away at this person because of thier brillance, they wanted him so they excavated him. so there's not alot left in some ways but a whole nother world has been created in other ways for him to survive it. i'm quite understanding of the madness i'm not afraid of it and i'm in control of it. things have been unravaling and they haven't been consistant, and people who i thought were one way were maybe not that way. and maybe i had certain beliefs that if you love somebody, that you're gonna like them to. and that's not always nessicerally true. and there's always something there to destract you. there's never really a true focus on relateing, not like the force taken with finding our differences in each other. so while i'm being i guess you could say defecated on by this loser creature, sort of voyer person, and i just can't become moldy cream cheese for someone. so i'm questioning the integrity of "the good guys" meaning us, i guess, those that are called "the good guys" there is a revolutionary type character that is educateing me in some of the transgressions that have that have happened and some of the factual things that have happened. and also your point of veiw all at the same time. he's very much about action and he's very passionate about it, and i'm seeing somebody passionate about something and so i begin to really understand that i've got to know what it is that you believe in and where i'm willing to go with this. because you know what you believe in, there is no question about that, and you stand by what you believe in. really the creation is about thier time tugetha, them as a unity. so much of this is about segragation even of a rain drop the separation of that. the tearing apart of a tear drop. extracting that,cutting that apart, the division. it's about separating that which you cannot separate, not really, there will always be strans there will be molacules. the taking of a child from it's mother, just because that child has been delivered from her woem, it dosen't mean that there aren't pieces of that child still in the mother. because a couple separates dosen't mean that there is not pieces of him still in her. i pick myself up from division and move on. i'm going through arguments in my head. i'm reading into as much as i can. i'm taking in information, i'm listening to people speak, i'm going to where "the learning centers" are and i'm drawn into hearing how people see the world there is someone in this that has alot of power and i'm drawn into this person who speaks and is able to rally people, but he doesn't really seem to walk it. and then there are other people i begin to look at more closely whether they're leaders or just people i know, acquaintances. who say one thing and it just doesn't feel right, and there's so much at stake here. i believe at a certain point our souls are at stake. the moral compass has been manipulated and that's what i'm discovering. so just when i think i have it all figured out as i remain hung up on it still. i don't want to leave it, it's almost like feeling a friend that's wounded not wanting to leave their side. at a certain point i relize that it's time for me to go. in a strange strange time, when the masks were down. i needed a ride and he had one to offer. and he's very much what you could say is one of those men who are more aware of women then a lot of women and gentle and fierce and has a lot of qualitties i think i would like to have in myself. and he's in touch with certain things he's able to shed some light on people useing thier religion for thier own means. and what that looks like the christianity that was sown in america, some of it gave people religious freedom as we know, and some of it took away religious freedoms away from the native people, where they weren't even allowed to speak thier own language for a long time. so these things that are part of our history, it's imparative for them to know if i'm going to truely except america for who she is. you know you have to know the truth, and in this death i'm kinda seeing what it brings out in people, and who some of these brothers really are, not who i thought they were. disallusionment again, and in some cases i kinda knew all along, some of it didn't surprise me but i'm seeing again what people here are made up of, and you know this isn't the outside now. this is not the enemy, this is a friend, an aquaintance in some cases. and the betrayal is there. so the idea of betrayal, you know there are all sorts there are all kinds of betrayal. and i think that i am coming to terms with that inside the betrayal of an inside force. where then you become defensive and start setting lines of separation and disconnection. untill wow you are completely stripped bare because it's from the inside, it's an inside job. i'm on this idea of men now. and i've been around all these men who have all these different perceptions of each other, and you could say some of them are intimadated by others, and some of them are envyous, some of them really kinda like the other one but are afraid of being rejected so they don't know how to approuch them. you know theres all that going on, so busy like little bees. i'm on my own now and i'm thinking about men and men and men's relationships with each other, and what it brings up. and so, i go to where people go to feel delicious, and then i go to another land where people go to feel delicious, another paradise, i find that there is room enough for both of them and that they're both very different. and desire is very much a part of all this. and at the end of the day desire will do what she does best, and that is to make you desire that which is not yours. so i leave florida for hawii and then go back to florida, not feeling like i have to betray one or the other, that there is room enough for both of them. that i can value both of them. i think that there is a healling all along the way in different parts of this but that's for the reader to sense or the listener to hear in the music. because it's in the music alot of that. those are the clues that i think take you to the real feeling the music is the place where the story is. i think i'm ready now i think that i've been preparring for this and breaking myself down and letting myself sore, and shedding ideas and ways of being to be able to take this in completely. you know this is a climax for us. i know the influences and thier trials and so now tuning into what thier needs are and i'm trying to find compassion for all that, as i go walk this walk and i'm able to feel it with every step and in myself there is a humbling of soul and there is a commitment i have made to a beleif to a spiritual path to something that is ringing true for me . this is something that goes right through my skin, right through my organs, right through my bones, and grabs me and shakes me and says, do you know where you stand as you walk. and so now this is very much about being other people and feeling how they feel, and feeling how you felt at another time, when you've been another place and it really isn't your past because some how these frames are written on your body and they've made you what you are. nothing is gone. so i'm part of you. i'm made of you, but there has to be a point where i don't have to keep having to be something in your eyes. and there has to be a place where i don't dishonner your spirituallity and you don't dishonner mine. i don't know why i have to go through you for some sort of soul purifacation for this exceptance this forgiveness. and i'm realizeing maybe more time has been wasted away on both sides and i don't know if we can mend it the rip may be bigger then us. i can't stop what's coming. it's alot like the great nothing, maybe i am like the southern orricalle. if you don't truely believe in your true self, it may destroy you.

Don't you feel worth less infront of that computer. I sure do. I feel as if i am doing nothing and my life is over. Maybe i need to get out (remarks: delete last sentence) Well, i do video editing and web pages and shit but where does that get me. That gets me another failed band....HMMM. (what to write next) (think think think think) Stop thinking and type damn it.....Well, i guess you rock. I have no idea who you are but on slam does it matter. You rock tends to happen, People may not know who you are but they think you rock. Thats a good thing right. Because they do not and they want to. Well, i am one of those sad souls. You rock. I don't/ I want to and all (like the rest of them) Did i tell you my spelling is not that great. Or well what ever it is.... I was sleeping...Wait i don't sleep. Fuck....wait i do sleep but saying i do not is cool....what do i do.....hmmm....I could be an emo kid like i am and say something special. But there is nothing special to say. Hmmm. is that anything at all. This kid needs to lay off. True that. He does. Sadly. Why can't I......Hollywood is where we are going to go.  We are going to make millions. Well, i am. You can follow if you wish. With some effort. rock (i guess)

      Post By: lunchbox benny Fri 01/30 22:44    sorry i haven't wrote much here, we've been in contact with alot of guitar players, and that's been the thing going on alot. and i didn't want to jinx any chance of working with them from posting here. truth about things i've been real broke, not to many hours to work in the winter time. so that leads to problems that bum me out. and the band has had some obsticals put in front of it, but nothing determination won't over come. gotta get back to the game of letting every one down while i piss everone off, and try to keep everyone as happy as i can. the good news is that this year is going to be pretty good for the scene, and my band. rough times now means a breeze later. stay tuned, i'll be here on a regular basis.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Wed 02/25 07:07    well going home was pretty predictable and there was a plesantness in that. keith picked me up to go hang out one last night, on the way to josh and erics stand by me came on the radio and keith turned it up, it really said it all. we saw him off at the bus station at five in the morning, just an hour ago. i tried to hold it together. it's hard saying goodbye to your best friend of four years, that was there for all the good times and bad. it's hard to believe they won't be by your side tommorrow. it's real heavy shit if ya want the truth, it rips your heart out alot like death does. no drug or amont of money, can change how i feel right now. it's for keith's best though, and real friend wouldn't stand in the way at a time like this, you just give your blessing and wish them the best. in hopes they can afford to come back and visit. it's sad now, but hopefully down the road, our bands can play some shows together and relive that green room magic. this is alot harder then i thought it would be, nothing has hit me like this. i think i'm closer to keith then i am with my family. this is a cue for a chapter change. "rock n roll! best wishes, friend. long may you ride, far may you ride, and far out may you ride! peace, love and blessings, to my rock n' roll brother.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Thu 02/19 02:47    wow, johnny goudie has got a new band in the works it's called telepathine, and i can sense johnny is ready to rock like full tilt, sexy rock songs! i can't wait! johnny writes the best songs in my opinion, he has really good taste, and his style has been softer, and more sophisticated on his recent albums, but now i bet he takes what i love about the project 'goudie' and just cranks it to eleven. these are gonna be songs that you don't make love to, you fuck to. and that's rock n roll, and why i adore it so much. it's sex sex sex. it's about going farther then the others would, that's why people look up to you mr. rock star, cause you have the balls to do what the last band wouldn't. you have to go too far, you have to push boundries, that's your mark in the story. it's all natural to me, but few people get it, but when they do, you have enough of a soul high you can plow through months and years of bad times. it's pure to me, it stands for something so much more real then god taxes politics, all these charity volunter people think they have a purpose, but my purpose seems ten times more important, everything is full of shit as we learn, but real true rock n roll is so simple and honest. infact it might have too much sincerity to it, to ever be excepted. people like their music lame, and plastic. it's all they can understand, too watered down by trl, brainwashed and marketed to.  i've lost alot of weight, i'm skinnier then ever, but you have to be to keep up with the anorixic hardcore kids, no flab in this scene. i'm on a poor budget of white rice and patatos, and generic mac and cheese. life is getting better and better, i quit working and i'm on vacation as i beg my family to help me with some cash, broke fuckers have had 26 years to save up and help me out once, but they won't. alot of people have the attitude, if your bands so good where's your cd? well most bands in this town get alot of help from their parents. now they'll get on slam and say "hey i have a job, i worked for my gear" yeah but you did it while your parents let you live with them for free. i don't have that option, nor would i ever want to live everyday with my parents, i think the same town would be bad enough. anyway i go back to a town i swore i'd never go back to this sunday. lyrics have been popping up in spurts lately, i get so busy i shut the writers door, but it's been cracking open, soon it will be wide open and gushing that's the way it always works. it's something i have to open up to, i can't just sit down and be like okay i'm writeing this song, things never happen that way for me. well time to do the dishes.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Thu 03/04 18:39    well shit i've been still lately, haven't been here since my last post. well getting laid always helps the ego. pump-pump-pump-pump pump it up. well i'm lineing up practice today (for sunday) long time since i've talk to the band. but i needed a break. 4 years of work with no vacation will drain your charge. next week is gonna be comunication week. lots of calls to make. but right now i'll deal with practice. then that. chris' band seems busy, but i have no intrest in watching veiwing or particapating in that kinda thing. i'm here to provide an alternitive to working class heroes. there's a post from someone named YAWN you'd think it was me but i don't care enough to post on their topics. but they say what i would if i cared enough to un button my lip. i just got a nashville pussy dvd "keep on fuckin' in paris" it's so essentail in my collection. the ranch bowl has banned the benny ford clinic from playing 4-20 show, so it prolly won't happen there. ever. titanic. breathe deep captain. i need to file taxes next week, that money goes to studio time for a few songs. i found a contest that has cool prizes like studio time mastering time photo sessions web sites and merch and a van. so i wanna work that. that starts with fileing taxes next week. things are well, and getting set into motion and being done right instead of right now. and this time next year i'll have a grin on my face. the web of time lines that don't weave well torment me but it will get set in a rhythm soon, and all will work well together.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Fri 04/30 01:19    well i landed a job today, i start a week from monday. i told my roommate, who was going to kick me out if i didn't have a job by tomorrow. i thought he'd be happy i got one, all he said was that's two weeks away. it's closer to a week really. i think he just wants me out of the house, anyway he can. his complaints went from, you're not putting effort into finding a job, to you're not putting in enough effort, to find a job by this date, to that's two weeks away. much like my former employer, they have a complaint, i cooperate. give them what they want, and they change the rules. can't ever win. everytime you win the race, they move the finish line. i think the real problem is 5 people live in this house and two are on tour all summer, one is here half the time to 25% of the time, so that leaves us two. and he wants to think he's the only one who lives here, king of the castle. so a little resentment forms. i guess if i'm really not wanted here i should make new living arangements over the summer. after thinking about things i would really like to live with more fun minded people, who aren't miserable and contagous. but we all live here for one reason or another. and i guess it's the only option any of us have, so we should make the best of it. for the time being. i guess i'm just tierd of not having a sense of being equal in living here, i'm quite and stay out of the way, i stay in my room it's not like i'm obnoctious. i'm sure it will be better when i have two or three jobs and i'm not here to notice all this stuff. i have a lot of things to tend to.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Wed 04/28 06:37    so i'm somewhere between the rules of attraction and mama's family, and lolita. i'm tierd so why stay awake for a movie and sitcom i know i've seen enough times that they'll just be repeats. tomorrow i make some final calls to people who will refrence me for this job i really want, which if i get it i'll tell you where it is, it's not a hard guess, actually real simple. i've been concerned about the part in the application where you put 'reason for leaving my last job' i don't think the pin people will bullshit for me they don't owe me any favors, well in their eyes, but i decided how to sneak around them, and that bullshit. that's a couple of the calls i have to line up. i'm running out of cash again, so i hope to afford a pack of smokes and the change to make these calls. i'm supposed to get kicked out on the first, but i think i have a little credit on the borrowed time master charge, taxes will be here in the next seven days. i need new chucks. drugs and to turn the phone back on, after this i'll be ready for interveiws and all that. i have to job hunt tomorrow, part of the borrowed time deal. i'm waiting to hear from the cat who's gonna let us practice in his club, for trade of free shows, jeff is still cool, drug free but everyone has a gimmick these days. my birthday is running up on me. i have a great list of refrences. buck bowen, zach surreal hennings, sophia john (one of my dearest friends, and program manager for 89.7 the river) matt markel, dave summers (who i worked for, for 8 years, and then one of my supervisors from my last job. so that's five amazing refrences and a supervisor from that shitty job i had, as to avoid contacting the owners. so i've lined things up pertty well. now it's just a matter of surviving untill taxes and land money show up. three months of vacation.... not bad. now we'll measure my luck by how many days i'm broke. ideally a letter shows up from mom today, and then state taxes the next day, land money the next day and federal taxes the next. and then pick the winng powerballs the next day, okay enough wish full thing king. i've been drinking alot of tea lately, it makes me have the most detailed believable dreams ever, it's shocking, i could go into them but, they're pretty self explainatory. and i'm not sure if i'm willing to put that on this table. there's people i trust who read these entries, and then there's some jadded jealous obsessed losers who like to talk shit about me behind my back and on the message board, and the only reason they have to do that is if they read these entries. and i don't do this for them. i do it for people who miss me and may be are distant, and when there's more of them to out number the five assholes who read this then i'll put more on the table. though i'd rather just believe i'm the only one who reads this when i'm writeing it. any way i want to keep certain people close, and i wish the flies would just forget about me and move on with their lives. in case they're wondering i'm gonna pass them, when i'm ready. that's how the story ends, i win. cause i've spent five years setting things up just right. and some things were ment to be. it's beyond their control and mine. it isn't in our hands. but they'll never understand that. ben zinn should know the things crissy has said about him in his absence, crissy's band members should know that he doesn't care about them, he uses them cause they will do what he tells them to and they are no more then four other people to pay shares of crissy's studio time. 3qe should know they are being used more then they are useing. crissy is good at useing people cause they don't see it till it's over. i've quit thinking about these people but i can feel them here, i can hear their wispers. i said it a long time ago, i wish they could grow up and go their own ways. i have. and i cleared the chips off my shoulder, too bad they can't do the same, then again they're all younger and and into dragging luggage around, some day they'll figure it out when they're surrounded by dust. that's the last i'll mention these people. and if you doubt my warnings about crissy useing you, just stop following his orders and playing his songs and paying to record them and see how fast he turns his back on you and starts dragging your name through the mud, and replaces you and moves on to the next fly who will follow orders, play his songs, and pay to record them. he sold each one of out before, just like the sweet judas he is. and if you knew how he spoke of you all in the bad times, in his completely most honest moments, you would understand. i thought they left me alone a long time ago, but they keep coming back for more. makes you wonder who the real entertainer is. how they visit here more then me wondering did he mention me?! do i affect him?! well you don't. i only let good people effect me these days, and other then your sent here i never think of you. you're so like a fly that is there in annoyence, yet i'd forget you as soon as you went away. may you all find what you're after in useing and being used. don't choke on the dust.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Fri 04/23 06:23    the jason listed the benny ford clinic as one of his favorite bands. that rocks my world. in addition to having me listed in his likes. also the drummer from maybe next year quoted me for his auto sig. these things remind me i'm not wasteing my time, and cool people do care. also being recognized on the street or at a sokol show, when they ask for an autograph it blows me away. when they light up and gasp benny. it's not a fame thing to me. it's just cool to matter to someone. there's a value in it most people will never experience. and then when i think about all the memories i have of meeting or hanging with rockstars and idols, we all know someone who makes up stories and brags about being back stage, when you know they're full of shit. and i sit back and go wow my life makes for quite the storytelling, thank god i don't have to invent these stories or exadgurate them. then if you throw on how my voice and stage presence has gotten alot better since we parted ways with crissy. i can't spell, but i'm good at alot of things, like writeing, conversations, carisma, poster displays, merch guy, light shows, it goes on and on. and i sit around feeling like i'm not enough, and always looking for a sense of being enough. it takes times like these to look at all these things, sometimes it's hard to see these things, but the jason, mnydrummer, and the kids open the door to that room and light it up. and i know i'm on the right path. the music chooses us. some people force them selves onto music and that's where the squares and lames are. but the people who are ment to do this, didn't choose this. it chose them   "Each one of us, in his timidity, has a limit beyond which he is outraged.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Fri 04/16 07:33    i think i'm a little hot wired from the iceing on krispy kremes and cinimon rolls, dr pepper and cocacola, and i worked for the first time in months so i'm kinda like fuck yeah! i'm pawning off the last bunch of cd;s i'm willing to part with. i need to buy some art supplies as mom would say. i have a good idea of when band practice will resume. and i'm rounding up refrences to get the job i want. oh yeah last night i cleaned an office building after the rb it was cake. and a very similar routine. well ann brought the tastee beef, and chips, and buns, and soda, and homemade cinamon rolls, lasauna, and the best fucking garlic bread i've ever had. after that jess obducted me and took me to work, and so yesterday rocked. today i do the cd thing, i have to get all the way over to 84th and center kinda, to get paid, and hopefully jess scores more work. sat i break down and apply for the sure thing, burger king. i'll work there or some grease pit till i get all my letters of recomindation in order. and the good news is i'm not getting evicted today as scheduled. so life's alright. i found out why i lost my job at the ranch bowl.... it wasn't anything matt kenny hasn't done a hundred times, i always said i was managment material. oh and i contacted blackheart records about reissueing the first four joan jett albums on colored vinyl in honnor of joan's eligibility for the rock n roll hall of fame next year. so i'm kinda impressed by my day dreaming ways, cause they really like the idea. next i'm trying to get the ball running on a tribute album in hopes i can submit a song. we'll see.  well things to see, people to do.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Thu 04/15 04:10    well lack of drugs, made me crazy enough to email a certain rhythm guitar player i've always wanted to work with, though he'll prolly never reply, it was worth a shot. i get everything i want (eventually) so i figured fuck it and tried. i saw the series finale of roseanne it kinda choked me up. turns out the last season (winning the lottory ect) was all roseanne writting in her basement writter's office, dan had died of a heart attack a year ago. and the last season was all in her head. kinda perfect way for her to end the show. well we got my taxes filed for real today, and the tastee beef is tomorrow at 2, we got side tracked getting taxes done. when i get my refund me and ann are going to olive garden on me. and maybe it's best taxes got delayed, now i have to find a job which means, maybe i won't use my taxes on debts and save it for studio. matt markell is writeing me a letter of recomindation, so i kinda feal honnored, not too many people he would do that for. i'm gonna pawn some cd's in the morning for cigg money, and do some applications after that, tastee at 2, work at 5. and hopefully i find some drugs in there somewhere. i've been going back to things i like in my teens. like roseanne and paula abdul. the thing that makes a fan is createing this cool world they never dreamt of, and make them think that's the world i wanna visit. jeff seems to be cool with the benny ford clinic, but his next few emails will tell me clearly. i see myself winning the lottery this year. if i do i think i'd try to keep it secret. but it will be 180 million jackpot if it happens. i think after 10 years of wishing to win, i could handle it now. anyway i'll be here tomorrow.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Tue 04/13 04:05    sorry the most important thing in my life lately is watching roseanne. i'm broke and smokeing tabaco out of a pipe. how native american of me. i've been clean for prolly the longest time in years. i owe back rent, my roomates tried to burn me at the stake a couple nights ago. when your flat broke your friends all become busy. so i've been cleaning my shoebox room, in case anyone visits which they won't but it's nice to have a clean room. on easter i met with aaron, he loaned me grocery money and we bitched about the people we hate. and we talked about chris' band name again. which i downloaded their songs and listening to them was the best i've felt all year, i was like this is soooo chris and soooo omaha hot shot non stop to nowhere fast. so i guess the rest is up to yoko ono. i met a guitar player named jeff he loves exile on main street and looks good and has a good attitude, i listened to a cd of a song he wrote, the guitar riff was good, but the drums coulda accented the song better, sounded like it needs to have some finishing touches, but over all i'm excited. he will compliment what we do and who we are. his only down side is he dosen't have a marshall stack and les paul. but it will all rock. i talked to storm about recording, he was wearing the pallidens shirt i gave him with a hot rod on the back and a SID name tag on it. we will record at presto for a week in the fall, storm will do all the guitar, cause from how i've seen storm record, you get the best result when he records all the tracks. except working class hero with aaron. the disc will be 11 tracks entittled "do it again" and a couple non lp tracks for promo and such. it will be mastered and released to radio in advance, we'll press it when there's cash and the timeing is right. this is my last few days of being gen x. the job hunt gets heavy this week, as i learned my former employer has to give me a new w2 with my correct social security number on it, so i can file before thursday. i have my accountent on it. she's the best, she can be a real bitch to people when i don't get my way. also she went to norfolk and got me some tastee beef, that's the home town loose meat restraunt i've been craving so bad i'd visit my home town to get some. but the cool thing is that they sell the beef frozen, so tomorrow will be tastee. it a very roseanne's dinner kinda thing. anyway the plan is to land a couple jobs in walking distance. oh i ride a bike now, yep even more gay. so if you see me walking my bike up a hill and smoking ciggs, that's cause i'm lazy and cool. i keep loseing weight effortlessly, more to starve today eat tomorow walk your bike up hills diet. yeah till i have a job, i don't get the rights of living in the house as the others do, so i sneek downstairs when they pass out, check my emails, i'll start leaving more entrees here. this years gonna be alot of saving my cash, not buying drugs, yet doing them one way or another. but i've learned how to live really cheap. i quit buying name brand smokes, i don't drink so much soda anymore, these days it's about over sugar dosed tea, frozen punches and stuff. rice pancakes patatos ham sandwiches popcorn and little debbie snack cakes. and actually i'm trying to ween off the smokes. to much cash. i'd have alot more cash then. i'm down to a pack a day. i can't wait to payoff certain assholes so i can quit biteing my tounge and shout FUCK OFF. anyways alot of ass kicking to be done this year. and in fact i'm kicking a little right now. check mate cock sucker!

      Post By: lunchbox benny Mon 05/31 09:47    well i went to the ranch bowl tonight and saw the huns, corey parks is in that band. jessica and jami showed up and got trashed, i hung out with keith. corey parks still fuckin rules, and i love nash gash too, there's room enough for both of them i learn, i don't take sides in the fued. corey had a sticker of joan jett on her bass, and her tits are huge and shes looking better then she did a couple years ago. she's still cool tough and rock n roll. but her nasty side is gone, maybe that's cause she's married to dwayne peters and in love. the show kicked ass and i talked to her after their set. i got her to autogragh my chitty chitty bang bang lunchbox. and i told her i saw her four years ago at the ranch bowl and just by watching her stand around after load in i learned what true rock star presence was, i couldn't take my eyes off her even if i wanted to. and that really blew her away and touched her heart, you could tell what i said in two minutes was one of the most memribal moments of her tour or maybe even her carrer. i offered her some drugs but she said she's been clean for two years now, and she's pregnent with dwayne's kid, and she even quit smoking, but if it was a different time she'd be all over it. when i saw her inside a few minutes later, she thanked me for what i had said she told me it really ment alot to her, i told her i ment it from the heart she's one of my biggest heroes. so that ruled. after the concert jami and jess kidnapped me telling me we were all gonna go to this party with free drugs and good times, and then they hung out at the ranch getting drunk for another hour, at 1:30 jess ditch on me change the plans went to some total loser's house and sent me with jami and we were all gonna meet up in a bit, well chris kept calling jami so we went to her house so she could talk with chris, said she would call some friends and have them pick us up and go to the party, she went inside her house to piss, i waited in the car. i waited for over two hours, then decided to walk home cause chris must have killed her. walking through north omaha at 4 in the morning with a chitty chitty bang bang lunchbox, high as hell, wearing make up is a scary experience to say the least. i got home to relize i left home in such a hury i forgot my keys and was locked out. i knocked on doors for a half an hour neither of the room mates home would wake up, so i broke in. the ranch bowl, and omaha are all into being well behaved and lame, that's where it at these days. the whole night i felt like i was in oklahoma or something, where pop machines close at 5 o'clock and if you burp you get locked up. anyway i'm glad i got to see corey and talk to her one more time, hopefuly her kid doesn't keep her off the road too long and we talk again someday. funny thing is that ruyter got alot better when corey left nash gash, and now corey is clean and looking good and rockin hard. if the they joined forces right now they could take over the world. but i now that road forked a long time ago. i'm just saying how even as kick ass each one was in the same band they've even gotten better, which i never thought was possible.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Wed 06/30 00:33    fuck yeah! i just heard from the benny ford clinic's new 2nd guitarist. his name is eric and he rocks my world. josh changed his phone number, but i got it and i'll call him tomorrow. i did get work all week, so i'm wore down. but i'll have my cd's back by the weekend. thursday i'm applying for apac and red lobster, for sure, this time. reserched the harris lab thing, you can only do it once so many years but it's worth it for once, i guess i'll take the apac job now and do the harris thing in six months, and hopefully work for gallup after that. but to the best of my knowlage we have a full line up for benny ford, and will be recording in about seven months for sure. i have a new living arangement, where my rent and bills are a total of $125 a month, as long as i keep the house clean, fair enough. so once i talk to josh, (by this weekend at the latest) i'll be able to focus more on lineing up pull the plug. so i guess i'm completely happy for the first time this year. hmm i smell a celebration around the corner! if i get to talk to josh i'll be extatic with like sun rays beeming out of my fuckin head and so on. i need to email sophia, zach, jeff.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Mon 06/28 04:06    hmm well i blew off the job thing, no bus fair. that's the way it goes. went to work for sophia's brother, i thought i'd get 12 hours fri but really got 4, went home, left, came back, "got fucked up by myself" thought about a river deejay i need to have a confrontational conversation with. and band shit, couldn't fall asleep, overslept and missed the rms, well woke up long enough to think to myself, i really only wanna go to talk to sophia, and she'll be bizy, also wanna confront that river deejay, but figured why bring shit up on such a day, i might learn some stuff if i go, but then again, it's all stuff i already know. you have to want it bad enough and bust yer ass to get it, and with the band not practicing, and no demos to submit, i thought it all might get depressing, then pictured the whole thing as being in school and like having a notebook with me and was like nah, next year. and went back to bed all in about ten seconds. woke up went to bk, back home, made my goal sheet of band shit, listed the most important people to me, and decided in addition to music, i wanna start work on an auto bio, cause well there's alot of shit to be told, wished i could document the struggles and drama of making the band, then went back to the book idea. decided i need to stay off drugs, and do that smoker human lab rat thing that pays 3,200 a couple of times for studio time. had alot of thoughts that wouldn't let me sleep, overslept fer work sunday, 2 hours late, i beat myself up fer that 2 hours, to find it was no big deal. worked fer 2 hours, got cut, hung with sophia, called surreal, made plans to go to buck bowen's show. got love hung out by myself mostly, and surreal. got news keith is ready to jet, felt bad about not seeing him, but goodbyes aren't the inspiration i'm looking for right now. i saw buck's friend justin, he has this "i'm not gay i'll kick yer ass (cause i'm gay) kinda sexyness about him. one time i slept on a floor with him, in the morning he had two pillows on top of each other, i had nothing but a coat, but at some point he had them side by side, overlapping under his head, like i won't give you a pillow, but i'll share them if you move over here, but he could have been asleep, and it coulda ment nothing. in the morning i think he was freejackhumpin the carpet. it's hard to say what he was doin fer sure, but he was covered by a comforter, even his head, but you could see his feet, and they were doing that thing feet do when your having sex like pushing the body with the toes, i've never seen anyone do that in their sleep. but i didn't talk to him cause he had that crazy look in his eyes. some hottie named jared was hanging out with me alot, like he followed me into the bathroom, and sat next to me at our table, wierd, cause he was the most fuckable guy there, 21, and talks about how he loves his girlfriend but she's not answering her phone, he asks me if i've ever thought things up in my head to be worse then they really are, i said yeah, like everyday. "well is it as bad as you think" no it's never as bad. "my girlfriend went bowling i can't get her to pick up her phone" well nothing lasts forever. " what do you mean" well people come in and out of yer life, for different periods of time, you may love them more then anything you've ever known, but you help each other through things, learn things, but nothing lasts forever, sooner or later that road has to split. "that's deep" (at this point he wants to hear everything i have to say, and i just wanna keep starring at his features) "well have you ever had a girl do this kinda thing to you?" i'm like it's just sex. "whatdoyoumean" it's just sex, everyone does it, and every relationship i've seen, ends with someone stepping out on the other, it's not a big deal "so like you expect it to happen" no, you should enjoy being in love, but keep it in the back of yer mind, that this always happens, so don't be shocked or pissed, just move on. "wow that's so depressing, don't you want love to be involved" i'm like i dunno, love has never had a part in it, i'm gay,( he dosen't flinch or schooch) i have sex with straight guys, it's kinda known that no one is getting attatched. "but don't you wish someone would love you enough that you can trust them to stay true, her phone dosen't even ring now it's going straight to voice mail" maybe i have a different angle on it, i've never been in a relationship,look people get drunk, someone hotter comes along and wants to fuck, it's the way it's always worked. "yeah she's hot, she gets hit on alot (he says sadly, then perks up to tell me) i get hit on alot" imagine that. well i have to go home now, remember it's just sex, nothing lasts forever, enjoy it while it's there don't lose yer mind when it ends. "thanks" so the night ends with i want drugs, i want to party with keith one last night, i want to do jared, and justin. but none of it happened. tommorow i try to work fer whiteway, wed me and sophia have a meeting. soon i need to apply for the job i planned on, but i haven't been here fer awhile so i thought i'd let ya know the skini. oh yeah buck bowen has cow balls.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Mon 06/21 03:42    well i talked with zache' today, so i'm not pushing the red button. all i need is to have a musician i know is there so i can pull the other members togetha, but when no one is talking to me, and i'm left in the dark, and think i'm all alone or starting from scratch i can go off the deep end. and yeah i know josh is there and i can count on him, but with him actions speak louder than words, and untill we're jamming his action are on mute. i hate greg is called pull the plug, now. it's just more classy to not give attention to the one's you hate. (but if i were greg i'd steer clear of me if he want's to keep his trachea) anyway, yeah it's an accoustic based idea for a project. but that's not why it's called pull the plug, people will assume that. but this project is a life support system for me, that's really what it's about. and i think pull the plug sounds cooler, i just hope people don't think it's the name of a hardcore band. and we're gonna need some female backing vocals, if i actually get this project togetha. and there's only one female i know who really wants a shot at it, so if i can get it togetha she has first shot at it. that's my thanks to her for careing about me at the right time when i needed it most. so email me when you read this and we'll talk.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Sun 06/20 02:19    well here's an entree for everyone who wants to see me fall on my face. my drummer can't practice for a "long while" my guitar player quit talking to me. i've tried calling my bass player a shit load of times, and only got voice mail. i didn't get the job with gallup polls. my friends are to wasted to come get me to make me feel better. and i have a scary amount of self hurting thoughts in my head. and to the gent that posted here last, yeah i'm probably the manson wanna be everyone makes fun of, unless your thinking about the singer from ox 45, or jeremy. who if you ask me have way more of a manson complex then i do. there's about 40 people i wanna be before marilyn manson. like corey parks, iggy pop, sam kinison, lux interior, scott bondy, so on and so on. but yeah all the really cool people think all i listen to is manson. so it's good to know what i'll be remebered for when i'm gone.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Fri 06/18 00:41    speaking of the rear veiw mirror, i watched my so called life on cable tonight, i love ray ann, i wish i had a friend like that, that just sees it all from a different angle, angela is interesting, the parents on the show and the ricki kid irritate me, but i use to love that show, when it was on abc, when it was on mtv everyone hated it, i was around alot of people at that time who shaped who i was and what i was allowed to like. god it's nice to grow away from that time. in my teen years the only things that made any sence to me was my so called life, nine inch nails, tori amos. god alot of years have passed. as much as you wanna believe you've stayed true to the same person you once were, you've grown and changed more then you admit. my favorite episode was the xmas one with julliana hatfeild. i look forward to seeing that one. like i never would have guessed way back then i would have grabbed jerod leto's ass one day, that was a great day, not as great as an ass as you think it would be, but it's a good story, well to me. it kinda pissed off jerod, i don't think he understood i was a fan, i think he thought i was belittleing him. oh well. i also watched chaseing amy, what a great movie, i haven't watched it for 7 years but it speeks so much truth, i should've taken notes 7 years ago. alot of great dialog in it, but they talk so fast, i wonder how much coke it took when kevin smith wrote that movie. anyway i gotta decide if i'm gonna sleep or walk to baker's for smokes, last time i walked to baker's in the middle of the night an old pal picked me up, it's weird that she recognized me. i love getting rides out of the blue, i like old friends. i hang alone most the time and i feel lonely, but when i get around more than one person i feel like i'm being pulled n,s,e,w,and i wish i was alone. the grass is always greener on the other side, get it while you can. anyway i should buy a copy of chaseing amy, well i should get my shit out of pawn first. urgh ! always gotta be something with red eyes screaming at me, baby red eyes needs a lullaby called pay check. i wanna smoke my last ciggarette and go to sleep. but any true smoker knows to never let that happen. grab yer pennies. hey it's supposed to down pour tonight, maybe grandfather will decide for me, that's as god loving as i get, according to my mom, grandfather is what native americans call their god, and he speeks to us through lightning and thunder and purifies us with rain, so i always love to see a light(ning) show. i don't even run from the rain, it's the best for your hair, nothing makes it as soft, people who run through rain make me laugh, it's only water, you can only get so wet. as long as you have a place to go and a towle with your name on it, why run. i love rain, i hate the snow, and i hate the hot sun, humidity, heat index. why can't it just stay 70 degrees always. or at least most of the time, we get one decent week in the late spring, and one more in the fall. the rest of the time is miserable. over the last 6 years winters, and summers, get worse and worse. rain pisses me off if i'm walking to work and have to stay soaking wet through my shift and get raw balls. but when your just going home getting soaked is fun.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Thu 06/17 02:39    so umm, i've started work on i hate greg, picked ideas for the project, burned them and gave a copy to jeff, we'll see what he accepts or rejects. jeff has a certain "cool" about him. like when i feel all awkward cause i don't know what to say or i'm tired and the hampsters not meeting his quota, he has this relaxed cool thing working for him. so anyway these songs they make me really sad, but i believe in their story. mostly love songs or love gone wrong songs, but uh, well you'd think they were about a man and a women kinda love. but when you take the time to talk with the songs you learn, maybe they're not about a man and a women at all. maybe they're about your mom or your dad or your brother or sister, or maybe just a friend that you counted on who left you hurting real bad, when you need them the most. i went to norfolk last weekend to pan handle, i was comfortable with the town and the low life, and trust me i was at low life hotel, i might have snorted some pills i found, they were the kind of pills that take away anxiety and make you sleepy, and they might have been the kind that could kill you if you snorted them, depending on the person snorting. and the only reason i don't pack up and go back to norfolk to become a crank head with the best of them is i hate crank it's a dirty drug and a dirty high, and the only reason i stay alive is cause i have band members i really like to work with and a pile of people from my past to prove wrong, so i struggle day after day in my quest for truth and beauty. and one of the people at the bottom of the pile is an asshole named greg, he made my life hell in junior high, and was the leader of the tribe that laughed me out of that school, laughed me out of that town. and the sick thing was i looked up to him and adored him, my enemy the one person i most wanted to blow up. the funny thing is that he grew up to be everything he made fun of me for. gregs have always pissed me off in one way or another, i don't think i've ever met a greg that was a true friend. they're always superficial people. maybe there's a greg out there that is really cool, but at this moment i'm sure i hate greg. anyway norfolk, that town just makes me wanna listen to ride on by ac/dc really loud and and drink beer with lesbians in trailer parks. but south dakota memories have been calling me alot lately. but i'm in omaha and i need to keep my eyes on the road not fixed on the rear veiw mirror, and i might have a job at gallup polls, it pays 13-19 $ an hour and could solve every problem in front of me so i really hope i get a crack at it. they seem to be mostly concerned about finding people with a consistant job history and good conversationalists so i think i have a good shot. i was re thinking about what i recently posted about johnny goudie and our art talking to each other, thinking that may be a bit too much to assume but i just read about how he was hanging out at a biker barbq and played a solo show for bikers. i love bikers they're so much cooler then gregs. this could be the meaning to life.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Thu 06/17 02:12    tears on the sleeve of a man  don't want to be a boy today  heard the eternal footman  bought himself a bike to race  and greg he writes letters and burns his cds  they say you were something in those formative years  hold onto nothing as fast as you can  well still pretty good year   maybe a bright sandy beach  is gonna bring you back  maybe not so now you're off  you're gonna see america  well let me tell you something about america  pretty good year  some things are melting now  well what's it gonna take till my benny's alright   and greg he writes letters with his birthday pen  sometimes he's aware that they're drawing him in  lucy was pretty your best friend agreed  well still pretty good year   "Whether it bums you out or not, the truth is, all this happened, as much as the first record did. But there are other characters involved a bit more. There are just other beings involved in this one. Like Pretty Good Year, for example, I got a letter from a guy named Greg in England. This one got to me - it missed getting to me for, like, three months. But it just got passed around to different people, and finally somebody just - I was walking through the record label in between the tour up in England, and somebody put it in my bag. They just said, "You know what, Tori? This has been sitting around here. Just take it." And I took this letter, and I opened my bag two days later, and I read it. It was a picture of - he had drawn himself. It was a pencil drawing. Greg has kind of scrawny hair and glasses, and he's very skinny and he held this great big flower. Greg is 23, lives in the north of England, and his life is over, in his mind. I found this a reoccurrence in every country that I went. In that early 20 age, with so many of the guys - more than the girls, they were a bit more, 'Ah, things are just beginning to happen.' The guys, it was finished. The best parts of their life were done. The tragedy of that for me, just seeing that over and over again, got to me so much that I wrote Pretty Good Year. You don't really know what my role is. Am I Lucy, or am I that eight bars of grunge that comes out near the end where I express, and then nothing, everything else is Greg's story? I found that kind of really fun. The emotion is coming from somebody else's story. And yet it touched me so that I could sing it."   "So this boy wrote me a letter. He's from the north of England. It's not, you know, one of them, it's not.. I guess I could tell you some letters that would like curl your toes and stuff. This is not one of those letters. But this letter inspired this next song. And he's from not quite Scotland, but in the north and it's where the working people live. Most people work their father's mine and stuff. They have a harder life than people in the south and then they kind of hate them. And anyway, it says, 'Dear Tori, my life sucks.' And he drew me this picture of himself - he's like an emaciated grunger with glasses and the drooping hair and drooping flower. He drew me a drooping flower...anyway, he's twenty. And he goes, 'look. ya know, I don't know what you girls expect of us. i mean, i can't figure it out. you know, first you want us to be a provider and then once we do that, we've gotta take like art classes on Thursday nights. and then you like, you gotta cum four times first. and then we have to like have the kiche in the oven, you know. and I don't know what you want!' and I was like, 'guys, I know it's really rough, but no pity."

      Post By: lunchbox benny Fri 06/11 03:06    i've got music in me and it wants out, i need to be useing my voice more, i need some practice. jeff our new guitar player is wanting to jam so i decided to start an accoustic project with him called i hate greg, it's my tip of the hat to my pal johnny's i love elke. i adore johnny, i email him about our shows and how i get grace slick drunk, and everything in my veins is rock n' roll. not to say i have much to do with his direction but he's been into playing shows and getting drunk, and his new album is gonna be rock n' roll. i feel like our projects are like having a conversation with each other. the only other person who's art conversates with my art is storm. so i'm times when i'm not having the best day, before i beat myself up i like to think about those conversations. anyway i hate greg is going to be wonderful. i don't where we'll perform the set but now the focus is on painting the picture. the great thing is we can practice almost anywhere, we could practice in graveyards if we had to. i guess i just really need something to live for in the moment. so we'll see. so now i have to go pick a cataloge, and early i have to go take in my time card and apply for a job with staff mid america, or something like that, go drop in on the family dollar store and try there to. so i should go now. sWeET DREAMS.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Thu 06/10 03:19    i have things to say that shouldn't be said. so instead of here i've been writting more songs, my muze is driving me insane again, i thought we had gone through this before but, it still boils up the same feelings it, may be the only fimiliar thing in life these days. i guess most important is i wanna practice and play shows, there's the bottom line. and yeah i'm in a bind over things i've been told, but it sparks the writters drive. and makes me see myself and what i'm capable of, the things that seperate me from the village. there's things only i can do, and no one can touch that or take it away from me. some people may be accepted better in this town than me, but if you put them outside this town they'd sink like a stone. i've always been recieved better by out of towners and rockstars. and the people who are in this compition with me ( a compatition i never applied for) can't ever touch that. and when i hit the stage i will shine like gold, diamonds, and prism it onto everyone in sight. cause that's what i do, and it may be for a crowd of 25 people and i may not get invited to the "coolest" party afterwards. but no one delivers like i do. i'm sorting through things, and it's the same thing i've been through so many times before, it gets easier to sail through the sadness, the clinging, the jealousy, the letting go, and the growing stronger and more determined. ever notice when you watch a movie more and more it seems to play in less time. it's like that.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Tue 06/08 20:27     every couple i know is splitting up this week, if love is envolved, especially a one sided love. my mom and step dad, my cousin and her husband, band members, when i was walking to the pay phone today i found this couple walking in front of me, a young blonde woman with a purse and two bags, one not even closed up, and her red neck auto mechanic boyfriend following her, she was walking to the same pay phone as me. it was all really akward. anyway i thought this was all due to the last full moon, but i found out that last night if you looked at the moon you could see a small round shadow in it, that was venus, it alined with the earth and moon i guess it happens again in 2012. weird stuff.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Fri 06/04 02:54    well i walked alot today, from maple to leavenworth to withdraw the last three dollars from my account, called into work and there was no work for tonight, walked up to dodge and then from saddle creek to kinko's to turn in my kinko's card for whatever cash was on it, i thought it was three or four buck only to find it was 88 cents, went to crossroads to the reserch corp, but they were closed, walk to best buy to see if i'd bump into my old friend karen but then remembered she moved to somewhere a few or five years ago, walked home. i stoped at a bus bench to rest and have a smoke, this car pulled up to the stop light, there was a hot couple driving around twenty, and this girl in the backseat, younger, maybe the type who would think she was over weight, her peers would think the same, she had a do rag hanky thing on her head, looked like she was the loner type, maybe into drawing or painting, or righting poetry about how the world makes herself look at herself harshly. anyway when she saw me her face just lit up, it was weird, she wasn't afraid to stare, her smile was so warming. like she couldn't remember the bullshit in her life that was filling her head just a moment ago, i looked away till they started to drive again and looked at her and she was still stareing, smileing. and it just warmed me up, everyone i looked at was lame all day, the only people i respected was bikers on harleys. when ever they drive by i feel a foot taller, and i look at all the pretty people with a look like, i could beat the fuck out of you rip your head off and fuck your body while your friends watched, but with a smile. that's how biker's inspire me. there so "i will bite your head off, yet if you've ever talked with a biker they're the most gentlemen like person you'll ever meet. and this year there are so many bikers rideing around. so i was feeling like a seven foot tall biker bitch all day, and givin people dirty looks and smileing at the ugly people. for some reason old people and fat people don't bother me. and the black people don't like the biker bitch living inside me, they always peal out with super attitude. like they think i'm racist just cause i have confidence and don't give them the right of way. i don't give anyone the right of way. i'm walking it's gonna take me at least an hour and a half to get where i'm going. they're in a car it will take them twenty minutes to get where they're going. so they can wait till i get out of the way. when your walking (or jogging, i don't jog but people who do get the same looks) it's like your on display for everyone driving by to gawk at, so i've learned to give them looks back, and it makes me feel better about myself. maybe that's why the cool backseat girl lit up, cause i looked at the people in the front seat like "i'll spit on you bitch and raped your boyfriend with a stick off the ground" anyway all that walking gave me blisters on my feet and my balls rubbed my inner thigh raw. i went to albertson's to by the cheapest loaf of bread and bag of suger i could find. i went to the 15 items or less aile, and some short little jock dude had like 100 items on the belt, and at least a hundred or more in the cart, we're looking at like 300 dollars in all his shit, he didn't relize it was the express aile till it he had the belt stacked up full, so i went over to customer service and there was a native american girl waiting on me she had a tatto on her neck and she asked me what tribe i was, i think she hit on me. anyway went home to eat pb and j, and let my feet bitch at me. anyway tres equis tonight, and i wanna run lights for pomeroy sat, they always paid me twenty bucks and i could use it. oh by the way no ones around passing me drugs, so i think i'm gonna go clean till i have a couple jobs. getting high makes whatever you are super pre fixed like if you're an asshole drugs make you super asshole, if your depressed they make you super depressed, and i'm not those, but i'm always worried about money i owe people, and rent, and it just makes me super worried. so untill i'm havin fun again there's no need for drugs.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Fri 07/30 18:57    wow, i can't for the life of me figure out who rexm is. but i'm suprised he posted what he did. hidden profile guys don't need to be nice, that's why i'm a little thrown off by it. well i can't get a hold of rian but the days not over. he doesn't sound or talk like he's 16. i look like hell today, i hope that doesn't scare him off. it's just the heart break of jeff moving, i really liked him, my exile on main street guitar player. and it felt like it was something i could count on. and it's a hard blow. i really need something i can hold onto, and believe in and not have stress over shit like this, band meetings and practice shouldn't be so hard, i read my blog today, i talk about too many meetings and practices that never happend. it's kinda annoying as a reader. i'm gonna kick a little ass over that. i should be worried about gigs and handbills. not that so and so won't call me back. i mean yeah i have my excuses for not getting much done, but still i've been a pussy with the band members. i've even been suicidal from them not be good band members. and no wonder people think i've failed, i don't blame them. i owe alot to josh and zach for playing in my projects over the years. but i deserve i bit more from them, that's what i'm seeing right now. because of josh, we couldn't play the 420 show. because of zach "helpin out" the undecided we lost jeff, cause he thinks we're never gonna go. like i've asked so much of them in the last 8 months. i'm frustrated. i deserve more, and i don't say that as a spoiled person i say it as someone who's getting fucked over, so much it's visable from a distance. we could have had a show this week in lincoln that paid 300 bucks, but because of me pussy footin around we're not ready. all that's gonna change. and i'll burn down the house of anyone who slows the process down. rian is really about playing alot. and to be honest. being a musician who hasn't even practiced in 8 months, i'm fuckin psycho, and it's my right both of them have gottin off with other bands. i'm getting in more determined mode. so there gonna have to deal with it. i am not loseing another guitar player. i could be booked in chicago at the double doom, i could be on sophia's underground shows. fuck. these boys better answer there phone next time i call, or i'll call twenty times in a row. roll me a carpet, i said roll me a carpet from here to chicago. i talked with keith he will be recording with the benny ford clinic and storm. but i'm really fed up with these things i counted on and believed in that slip through my fingers. i need something i can see, hold, rest my head on.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Wed 07/21 06:06    everyone and everything i've touched i have changed and transended. i may have fallen from grace. some of my antics may be seen as questionable, in poor taste, outrageous or in their best light excentric, by outsiders and my closest circle. but my life is a piece of art and everything has layers of meanings through cause and effect. even the things they think i should regret. you see i read in between the lines and i'm considerate of the ones i care about. and that leads to seeming close to perfect, and i've learned that can be annoying. so i flaw myself from time to time. that's part of making it a "real" relationship with people. it can't be roses through the entire travel. if it is you're not really that close with anyone. there has to be disagreements. times that make you angry or cringe or curl your toes. and thats the one thing i want to be understood that no one will see on their own. i have to go farther then the rest. i have to be one of a kind. something that could never be truely copied. divide and concour a village? no. divide and concour a person with in themselves. we must be here to affect and change people but you have to start with the ones close to you. i take a different approuch to things, like sex, sex is different for me then everyone i know. you see they know their path that A goes with B and they always have known that, it's been very clear to them. at the same time all i've ever known is that A dosen't go with B for me. and i spent alot of dorment years on good behavior's pause. and i've had to experement with different things. and yes i'm experienced babe. and my limits are set different then yours. and the way it is for me is i need to travle the entire road north to south to see each town and decide which town is best for me to live in. and ghost towns don't have tour guides waiting to greet you, i have to conjour them up so i can see the town. and that comes from a bizzare ritual and there's always someone there saying "are you completely nuts? what are you doing?" but what they don't realize is that i'm just a graveyard deejay playing a request for a single listener i have, and a friend has always dialed in without understanding, i'm playing this song for my single listener, they called me and requested the song you hate. i didn't play it to make my friends hate me. my dad bailed on me before my first birthday, i met him when i was 12, i thought it might be good to be in touch with him, but not after long he told me to fuck off, my grandma was killed by a drunk driver when i was 13. and my sister was hit by a car and killed when i was 14. so i developed issues of abandonment then and i thought i would live so long i'd have to watch everyone i love die or walk out on me till i was all alone, the last one standing. well i don't feel that anymore, i feel like my days are numbered and i could be gone next week or 5 years from now or 10. so when things with the band don't happen, well a week seems like a month, and a month feels like a year. no one in the band realizes this, and they don't know how much it costs every weeks nothing happens, how deep it cuts, how frustrated i get. but you can not demand things of these people, you take what you can get and smile. but the map's legeand of timeframe and travle is a huge difference. and i only hope i can time capsal something before i go, maybe i should show them my hour glass, but they'd just asked a bunch of questions and i really don't wanna talk about this. i've always been ahead of the herd, like full blown rose, i had that first, working class hero was a band name i had first and a song i covered, prom songs the war years, i had that before 9-11, covering the nirvana song before it was released, having a band that covers obscure songs that please the band, i did that and then tres equis did it, everyone wants to belittle my projects because we cover songs, but look at joss stone, her debut album is all covers. and hardcore kids ha. they wear girls jeans, that's how they get them so tight, and converse shoes, and black shirts, and acting as faggy as they can. i had a head start on all them cats cause i was doing that when it was a disgrace, now it's a disgrace if you don't. and 8 out of 10 "rock videos" you see the band is made up of young skinny white boys with good jaw lines. i've got a life time of examples i could list but i won't , 'ecause i know i was there first. now i say this humbley, when i'm dead these people are gonna realize that i was one of the most magical people they will ever meet, for so many reasons. the only time i get suicidal is when i want everyone to see and learn only what they can through me death. but i want to live as long as possible, it's just i wish they had that knowlage now. you wanna know why i started a band? well it was the last couple years of ivory star, and there was a boy named brandon van huesen, he had a band, and he was the small town gay kid who came out to shows, he had a crush on storm, storm is 100% straight so he wasn't threatend by brandon and would hold a conversation with him, and i fell in love with brandon, he was incredably good looking and that was the only relationship i was ever in, and basically brandon used me to get closer to the band, and get on guestlists, and have a few backstage stories that he'd change when he told people. i got burned really bad, and i decided i was gonna start a band that would be 100 times better then brandons. and i would have storm in my band. that's how the whole thing started in my mind. and that's part of why storm is willing to play a few shows with us and record. so in some respects i can say i won. so i started looking for band members over four years ago, and in the process of putting my rock band together, i met a wonderful person. johnny james he played guitar in a band called pick pocket, and he walked up to me and gave me a cambells soup jar with a baby doll in it filled with yellow food coloring, like an aborted fetis, he told me i was beautiful and had a great ass, and told me to take this jar and keep it with me untill we met again. and then he introduced me to his girlfriend. well i carried that jar with me for weeks, everywhere i went, kinda like the high school project where you have an egg you have to take care of. and it fell off my cart at work and shattered, so i got a new jar, put a dollar sign on its chest and gave it alice cooper eyes, and painted it nails black, and put it in a jar with gold glitter, and when i gave it back to john i gave him a copy of alice coopers billion dollar babies. he wrote me poems, and i fell hard for him, but he was committed to his girlfriend, i wrote songs about him and we went the movie from hell, i haven't been to a theater since then. well i used to call him almost every night, and then i'd cry myself to sleep wondering if we'd ever be togetha, and i wanted a band and he was willing to play in a band with me so i started the project prom songs the war years, all the songs i picked were about johnny james, and he was gonna play accoustic, and i couldn't find a drummer, and after a while johnny james left for collage, and that's when i asked aaron to join, based on one song called working class hero that was like our life story. well i got the band put togetha, and booked a show over xmas vacation just in hopes johnny james would see the set, and i saw him and invited him but he didn't show that night. i dedicated when will you be mine to him. and i never heard from him again. untill last friday night, i went to buy ciggs at albertsons and while i was in line i heard benny, and there he was, the beautiful straight mormen that likes my ass. and we exchanged email addresses, and i told him i was trying to put togetha another accoustic based band, and he said he was going to iowa state this year and could be back on weekends, so just maybe it will work out this time. i kinda really need him to fix my bad thoughts. for months my mom has promised me a couple hundred dollars in land money, it showed up last week and from what i heard she was gonna send it right away, so i waited on it and borrwed and used credit, and promised people it would be okay, but i talked with my mom tonight and she got drunk and spent it, and we had unkind words, i told her to kill herself, and i feel really bad 'ecause there's a good chance she might. so that sucks, i'm in deep shit and need to get a job quick, and trying to get jeff josh zach to meet once is near impossible and i'm about to go insane trying. i called josh to find out what night to do it but, voice mail, i always fear he's quit talking to me and disowned me, and he never has, but this time it's prolly true, i asked him to call me back and let me know so i could start, that's not so hard to do, call and say saturday or sunday. i tried calling zach to see if anynights were not gonna fly but, no answer. he's been playing with the undecided everyweekend so yeah. this is prolly gonna get ugly. cause if it was as simple as no one being available on the same night i'd know already. and jeff is mia. god this should be smoother then it is. well i found a keyboard player for pull the plug, now we need a drummer and of course stupid me wants to ask josh, when really i should be thinking of a different drummer. i need to clean the house and do dishes, i've been painting for two days, and still not done. i need sleep, band meeting to be set, a job. and a neck massage. i'll talk to you in a couple days. if i'm not in a padded room by then.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Mon 07/26 07:20    i had the coolest night playing poker, first off i'm gettin really good at it in a kenny rodgers psychic way. but i was chat with this dude, and we're gonna start a gang that dresses in drag and robs banks, and has machine guns, and knifes and motorcycles, and we where leather like matrix style. and we beat up mormans and do drugs off their asses and rape em, and spit on kids and push there dads over and beat up clowns. and the rest of the gang is midgets in cowboy boots and birthday party hats, and they video tape us fuckin up mormans. and his name is sick knif, that's what i named him, he named me large boobs benny, and we're gonna meet in hartford, and travle west knockin over banks in drag, and then were gonna take the cash to vegas, and gamble and rob gamblers. and were tough and we say grrrr when people say hi. and then were gonna get motorcycles from the american chopper dudes. it's so fuckin cool. we're the ghost riders and we fuckin rule. actually sick knif is a trance dj and he owns a club in hartford and he's gonna give the benny ford clinic a gig, when we tour. i heard back from rian the 16 year old guitar player. he's been playin for 6 years, and he's prolly the coolest 16 year old around. he plays a strat like jeff, but has no amp, but his mom seems cool if she dated traci guns, so i'm sure she'll but him an amp. we're gonna meet this week, so i can give him a cd and show him where i live so he can be at our band meeting. i'm going with sophia to her driveing test today, then to another dmv so i can get one of those books to study, then apac, to apply, then call whiteway for work. this weeks gonna be insane, but that keeps me sane. also i found this cool site for helping vocalists PROLOBE    "Each one of us, in his timidity, has a limit beyond which he is outraged.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Fri 07/23 16:38    hmm well i almost had a band meeting set josh and jeff were down but zach is recording with the undecided. it kinda sucks 'ecause when i talked to zach weeks ago and he told me about the undecided, he was like yeah "i'm just filling in as a bass player. it's not serious, and i'll let them down before you." and he's been playing shows with them since, last week we couldn't meet 'ecause he went camping, this week he's recording. he can tell i'm at my wits end about this through my tone, so he'll be open to meet next week, but then josh or jeff will be busy. i'm calling jeff tonight to tell him to not make plans. eric dosen't keep in touch much. so i don't fuckin know. the money mom never sent has burned me hard. but i learned i get some money when my grandma dies, so that good and bad, 'ecause i need the cash to record with storm, but how can you know this kind of thing. it's like what do i want more, my grandma alive or to time capsul my art. well i might have work tonight, i need to raise 56 bucks to bail my cd's out of hawk. i owe 40 bucks to the house, and i owe 90 bucks to the sharks. and i need to have rent in a week. so i could get a job, but i need to do temp work for fast cash first. it's a rock and a hard place. the sharks won't talk to me, my friend wants to talk with the sharks, so it all falls down around me, and now no one wants to talk to me. and i owe lots of cash to everyone else i know. so the 4 cylinder hurricane touches down. off to shower in case i get work.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Sun 07/11 05:53    i've been hideing in poker games alot. i owe rent and can't pay it, so i had to ask someone i thought i'd never ask for a loan. we'll see what they think about it. but i'm gonna have a job if not two next week, and i'm gonna pay everyone back. so that's bumming me out, and drug friends have excluded me, literally not answered the door, and sent me to voice mail. that really cuts deep. and makes me listen to old bob dylan. "i used to be among the crowd you're in with" is like banner material. and i'm trying to see past it, but you really learn what these brothers are made up of. it becomes clear that people you trusted or felt really close to are capable of being cold as steel, to the soul, and then onto my soul. i tear up when i realize i'm giving more then i'm allowed to take. i'm sending out alot more invitations then my brothers are. and i feel used. and it's a ugly feeling, being used. and it's selfish and ruthless, cold hearted, and cut throat, but it's from the inner circle. it shocks and shoves me.   taken from a previous entree  "manipulation makes me cry especially when it's with people you supposedly are close with. you see covert activity you would think would come from the outside forces, not the inner circle...  ...i'm kinda seeing what it brings out in people, and who some of these brothers really are, not who i thought they were. disallusionment again, and in some cases i kinda knew all along, some of it didn't surprise me but i'm seeing again what people here are made up of, and you know this isn't the outside now. this is not the enemy, this is a friend, an aquaintance in some cases. and the betrayal is there. so the idea of betrayal, you know there are all sorts there are all kinds of betrayal. and i think that i am coming to terms with that inside the betrayal of an inside force. where then you become defensive and start setting lines of separation and disconnection. untill wow you are completely stripped bare because it's from the inside, it's an inside job."

      Post By: lunchbox benny Sat 07/10 02:16    well, things slowed down, but i haven't acomplished much. i owe alot of friends money, it bums me out, when friends have "some reason" to not hang. anyway the benny ford clinic is meeting this sunday. hopefully practice starts soon. i only worked tonight, no cash, the road is bumpy, and not in a good way. so yeah i'll have a full time job if not two by next week. it's bust ass time, one good thing about taking 7 months off as a band, you can look at what you've done with clear eyes. i'm proud of everything. from Prom Songs on, i've always tried to put my balls on the table, in ways no one else would, that's a rule of great art i think... the message that was set on the table, the small scar it made. i love it all, the songs, the band, the time. it was all wonderful. but then came the chicken hawks, and grabbed my soul, everything has been easier since then, prom songs, things seemed to always be moving further away, as were full blown rose, the benny ford clinic, they have always been about moving closer. and it flows easier. it makes more sense, the voices tell you where to go. i'm not in present mind frames, i'm focussing on reading the map, making sure there's enough fuel to make the trip. and realizing what it is i have to do to make it happen. push the button, make it happen. push the button, make it happen. teeters huh, well i'm made of strong stuff. like exspensive burbon. to the table.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Tue 07/06 23:52    poker is addictive, i just played for the first time tonight, i lost all my quarters, it was fun. i only won one hand, i coulda got it back but the dudes from that one band uh what's their name...i can't remember their name, ah wonderful band, fabulous band, um lloyd's band yeah the rythym section has my cigg/payphone money. i coulda got it back but they only played for about an hour till they had most of the money and left, i consider that cheating i think, i have no problem losing at the game, but i don't think it's sportsman like to do that. poker buddies have looks, signals and signs, like let's go home before they get their money back. but then fuck em, coinstar takes 9% of the coins you put in it, so everyone bleeds a little, but coinstar is definently make the money off poker players.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Mon 07/05 22:02   urlLink      yeah i'm trying to learn how to play poker, there's so many kinds, anyway i've learned the hands now the lingo or what'd they call it ... jargon that's it. my whole life i never thought i'd play poker, mainly cause i don't know the rules. but i guess yer more likely to find me playing cards then bowling. i never played sports, cause no one ever played sports with me and i never got along with neighborhood kids, and in school i knew i'd come in last so i never tried, just played it off like i didn't care to try. ya know just walk the track. but this is somethin i can handle. though i think i'm more a black jack kinda dude. the forth of july, i watched my friends shoot fireworks, and burn themselves, had a couple beers, and some pizza hut. it's nice to be invited somewhere on a holiday, i'm use to spending all of mine alone cleaning that one place. i tried to call sophia but got voice mail and decided to spend the last of my cash on ciggs and doritos nacho of corse. and i was broke today so i babysat my 4year old 2nd cousin, for ciggs, and bk. which was cool she slept and i cleaned the house. what a bizy couple of weeks. backyard babies are playing l.a. in august, i hope keith gets to meet them. and corey's thoughts about playing warped tour sound like what i'd be saying. anyway i gotta line up a band meeting night thing, and burn, and email. poker's steeling my attention right now.

Hey guys just thought I'd check in ....one more show to go. as you  know the HUNNS are on the Warp tour fucking-emo-faggot-geek fest  2004. I got one fucking question WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO ROCK AND  ROLL????!!!!!!!We are fucked!!!The hunns are ripping every show and  are definatly one of the faves of the other bands and crew for the  tour, sets are condensed to about 20 minutes so you can imagine the  kind of energy me and the boys(epecially Mr. Peters) can  generate.....everything short of throwing up on the audience.  but BORING beardo surfer shorts and thongs crybabies like  yellowcard- Thursday-thrice whatever the fucks are stealing the  fucking shows!  Oh and flogging Molly fucking forget about it....you would think  you we're at fucking AC/DC concert if all the fans did'nt know what  the fuck they were with beards and long straight pink and blue hair,  bellbottems with creepers and studded everything- pierced faced  carrying stufted animales for christ sake AAAAUUUGGHHH!and the bands  doing like 35,000.00 a night in merch.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Sat 07/03 16:37    i went to a bar in benson called mick's last night and saw tres equis, the bar is really cool, they had art, and nice rugs. i hungout with troy and strange pleasures on break, i told them yeah i saw you play at the music box, when transitor opened for you, and he was like i hope they played good that night. i never responded. storm was cool of course, i talked to him while his girlfriend ate his neck. i told him, i found a second guitar player for the band, and he's another student of storm's, i don't mean for it to happen it just does. storm appolagized, and i was like nah it's cool with me, it actually lets me know they're on the same page of what i look for, it's just not like this stated fact that you have to take lessons from storm or worship him, it's just the way it works out. storm was like who is he, i was like eric post. storm lit up and was like he goes way back, and we talked about him and storm told me where he came from. i hugged storm, one of those strong hugs that you hold longer then most hugs, said good night to the tres equis, they kept telling me not to lose touch, like ya miss two shows and they think they'll never see ya again. walked home in the rain. i never got my cd's back, not enough cash to pull it off, i bought alot of jeans at goodwill, i worked all week in this building at 144th dodge, all the doors are outomatic and the lights too, you wear a pass thing that lets you into the building and rooms, and the elevator and stair won't open unless you have one, it was a cool building to work at. and the genral manager of the building sent a letter to the company i work for saying that the difference between last week and this week were a noticeable improvement and should keep all the people who were working there. and i was the only different person. so i thought i'd get offered a permanent job, but, well. i'm not suppose to know this but my supervisor told his boss they should put me at 62nd and grover at the mud building cause they have a big turn around out there, and thats my first choice of all the building i worked cause it only takes 45 mins of a bike ride home, the closest building to my house. his boss talks with the co boss about it on tues. so i have a decent job. 250 a week, that is better then the ranch bowl, and i can work at apac or red lobster in the day. i need to work my ass off right now, storm was telling me how he won't have anytime off till august and i was like i won't have any studio money till winter, at this point i have to payback who i owe money to, have rent money for our practice space, i 've decided to help get a floor tom for the band we need it for studio, and small rooms we'll play. and studio time and a car to get to work in the winter. so it's bust ass time, and i need to clean the house well today it's the first day off i've had all week, and that keeps my rent down so. i've been giving advice to a dear friend, it's hard because it envolves love and girls and when i give advice about that i tell them things no one else will tell them, so i tend to go to far and piss them off, but a true friend tells it like it is, even if you don't wanna hear it. watching storm play is so amazing, to think he's gonna record with us this winter it just makes me feel 8 feet tall. he was wearing the paladins shirt i gave him, it was the right size, had a hotrod on the back, was a paladins shirt (rockabilly band that has been together for decades) and it has a auto mechanic name patch on it that says sid. it must be one of his favorite shirts, the last two times i saw him play he was wearing it. and i've been over cultured this week, from selling greek gyros, to working with mexicans all week, i liked the crew i worked with alot got along great, but they speek spanish all the time, the women who worked with me was real nice and spoke alot of english, it got hard to follow a couple stories, but it was great to work with her, she told me i was a hard worker, i got a salsa recipe from her, and she's gonna put in a good word for me at red lobster. so it's been an amazing week.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Fri 07/02 03:47    in a strange strange time i needed a ride and he had one to offer. shot in the dark, trapping a spark. i call on a dear friend, one of the most important people in my life, prolly in the top three, though they don't know it cause we don't talk about it. and i don't call often and i don't ask for much, so they appear with their heart in their eyes, at just the right time. from solitare to poker, you're still the best chess player i know. you take your time and seem to never make a move, but when you do it's the most perfect and important move you ever saw. it has layers of meaning and is done gentle and strong, it says volumes of things that can't be heard. like when actions speek louder than words. i feel worthy to be invited to this game. opening your doors sacrificing the bishop and laying your vunrabilitty on the board. and then i know you're commited to the game, your loyalty is thick. i know that now, sorry if i ever doubted it. there's an honner that goes with it, and it's beyond win or lose, that's not the big picture. it's about being a part of this, with you it is an honner. it's valued more than you'll know. amazing how much you can get out of a good game of chess. amazing how much you can affect me, not many can, i don't understand why you get that power, but you do. who's move is it? well i'm in a place where i'm really happy, maybe the berlin wall just came down, but the struggle is over, the suffering has ended. i'm not hanging in ugly towns this week, the scenery is good here.not too grey not too hot, driving with the full moon lighting the way. for once we're not worried about breaking down in the next town. we're not driving a car anymore, there's more confidence on this trip, we're rideing on harleys, there's alot more pride this time. i feel peaceful and centered, calm. and i have what no one else has, a 6 million dollar pair of socks.

      to you it's another day to me it's a grim reaping just another shooting star strung out on your wire  prick my finger on his virgin silver he told me raw, ginger - it carmelized me  tombigbee, tombigbee help me hang these bones, gotta hang these bones out to dry ellude me, he loved me ravishingly low gonna hang these bones out to dry  got a blackberry stain and they're not even in season if you're not yet a woman you got no business playin' at this  tombigbee, tombigbee help me hang these bones gotta hang these bones out to dry ellude me, he loved me ravishingly low gotta hang these bones out to dry   so you get done then you get some sure 'nough it won't hold you for long then you say "right. This is all mine."  but hasn't your donor card expired?   from blueridge to cattail on the prairie from flyover country back through mississippi i said go man you go well you raise me  twenty  i'm raisin' you   five   hundred treaties   signed by yer father's lies  i said go man you go cause i'm trailin' her tears the ones you won't hold you roll me a carpet roll me a carpet Boy roll me a carpet from here to oklahoma  tombigbee, tombigbee help me hang this bone, gotta hang these bone out to dry ellude me, he loved me ravishingly low gonna hang these bones out to dry  i'll do it again dry  a reference to the Tombigbee River. The original Choctaw (Native American) homeland took in most of what is now the state of Mississippi, plus some smaller land holdings in what are now the present states of Georgia and Alabama. It was rich land, bordered on the west by the Mississippi River, and included the rich bottomlands of both the Tombigbee and Pearl Rivers and their tributaries plus millions of acres of rich timber and hunting lands. It was decided by the U. S. Military, who found themselves looking at a French port just across the river, that they needed an extensive "piece of pie" shaped chunk of the Choctaw Nation as a buffer against any possible French invasion through Indian country. Within two years, the United States negotiators were back with even bigger demands for Choctaw lands, which would give them most of the rich Tombigbee River valley farming lands. Despite very few Choctaws attending the negotiations, the conference agreed and the Treaty of Mount Dexter was signed Nov. 16, 1805. It is ironic to note that in this treaty the U.S. government pledged "this is the last time that the United States will ask the Choctaw Nation to give up any of its traditional homeland and will hereafter respect the Choctaw borders and Choctaw laws." They lived up to this pledge for 15 years. It should be noted that, in the meantime, between the 1805 Treaty of Mt. Dexter and 1820, there had been a major shift in policy concerning the Indians of the southeast within the U.S. Government. And, the decision had been reached that the southeastern tribes, including Choctaws, Creeks, Chickasaws, Cherokees and Seminoles must be removed to "someplace in the west" giving all of the rich cotton growing lands east of the Mississippi to the whites.

      well keith is playing bass filling in for jenifer precious finch's band (from L7), it's called the shocker,  urlLink http://www.shockersite.com  they tour in oct. so i hope they come close around. maybe i need to leave this town. but i think i'm thinking about band shit too much, so i'm gonna focus on a job and paying back my friends. i had things together alot better when i was high, being clean is kinda boreing. actually when i look back i had my shit together better when i was 17 and i really had it together when i was 7, i'm always trying to get that grip back. and i can't get high because of piss tests, and i can't enjoy being high when i owe people money so, instead of waiting around for emails that never show, and dealing with band shit, i'm gonna work on the other half of my life. a watched pot never boils, so maybe this aprouch will acomplish more, or divert me. i'm not giveing up any of the bands, it's just time to pay the bills. that's how i work, i try at one thing and if it works i'm on a roll and i get the right mind set to acomplish more like i'm on a roll. so banging my head against the band wall just isn't working. i just get bummed and don't try to fix anything else. in more super human times i would be trying to accomplish everything at once, and that's where i'm trying to get back to.

      well one down two ta go i heard from rian. he was very dedicated and professional about keeping in touch since we met. since i didn't hear from him and he missed the band meeting, i figured he wasn't interested, or heard some of the infamous rummors about me. but i just got an email from him, he's down for john beverly and he has the place to practice and i really like him as a person and musician. he has a passion for collecting guitars vintage and new, and the SG les paul is an great piece. i also like what he writes, and his dedication to the band. he wants it really bad and that's important to be sucsessful. so this is good. now i really need to hear from josh and zach, and sophia. i emailed all 4 and the only one to respond was rian. but that's better then the last six days when none of them emailed me. if josh and zach only wanna do the benny ford clinic and play a couple shows a month and make little money, that's cool with me. if they wanna do john beverly and play most weekends and make decent cash, that's cool with me too, if not i can find people for john beverly, it's real easy to find people when you can pay them good. and if they don't wanna work with me at all, that's fine too. cause i'm gonna prove i was and am one the best frontmen / band managers / amazing person to work with. and i'm gonna make every goal i have come true. that's the power of rian. as long as i have one dedicated musician i can make things happen alot easier then from scratch. i have some lyrics to post later, but now i need to email a few people.

        Penitent Thoughts, Misguided Schemes, I Try To Stop What Eats Away At Me, I Need A Place To Stow Away Fear It Hides In My Face, When You're Not Here  If It's Not What You Wanted Well That's The Way I See Explain It To You Later When You Get Around To Me  More Wasted Time, I Stammer About Too Much or Too Less, And Then There's Without      YOUR PRECIOUS SPACE, AT OUTRAGEOUS COSTS I WILL NOT FADE BUT I CAN BE LOST       If It's Not What You Wanted Well That's The Way I See Explain It To You Later When You Get Around To Me Explain It To You Later When You Get Around To Me       Hurry And Wait For The Next Day Well Maybe Then I'll Know What To Say You Leave Me To Fight With My Own Head Now I Can't Wait For Tomorrow      If It's Not What You Wanted Well That's The Way I See Explain It To You Later When You Get Around To Me Explain It To You Later When You Get Around ..........         this was written by donette years ago but it never got recorded. it was actually forgotten by everyone except me. PROM SONGS:the war years played this live. chris was awfull on it, i explained it was tuned half a step up, he said it didn't matter, but his guitar always sounded way out of tune and really fucked with my pitch on the song. josh made the drums better then dave smith, josh put some soul and feel into it. anyway this is from what they call ' the beginning ' it's funny this song has always followed me. i don't know why but i only care about people who will take forever to get back to me. i should have my head examined. so this song she's a good friend of mine she shows up in the " mean time" and pats me on the head.

      looking back on things, i've let go of alot of hate baggage. i've taken chips off my shoulder, i haven't cashed them in yet. but the balancing a tower of them on my shoulder has become kind clown like. kinda like spinning plates on poles. so yeah, i don't want much. just to hear from josh and zach. saying sorry i've been busy, or fuck off i've had enough. it's an awfull feeling like the junior high girl waiting by the phone for two weeks straight. or the high school kid looking out the front door waiting for his friends to pull up and they never show, or the 11 year old boy who spent his birthday sitting on the pourch waiting for dad to visit. what an awfull feeling. it's been peaceful and still lately. i actually need the hurricane to do me a favor....

      Post By: lunchbox benny Thu 08/19 09:18    it's so weird to read the posts on this blog as one drops off everyday from last year. just goes to show how much i've been running in circles. a year ago i thought it couldn't get any worse, like it had to get better, fuck was i ever wrong. i still don't have a job, and what true friends i had i've borrowed cash from each of them, and i've dissapointed them, that hangs heavy on my head. but at the same time i can't function cause of band dilemias. just bad timeing and hard knocks. i never got a chance to hang with john (johnny james) and soon he leaves for school. it would have been very healing to see him. well i decided i'm starting yet another project, i still have plans for benny ford and pull the plug, but i need josh and zach for that or their replacements if that's what it comes to. but i can't count them out yet. so the new project is called "John Beverly" it's the coolest name and no one has used it as a band name. it's sid vicious' birth name (of the sex pistols, for those who don't know) i don't know who will be in it boys or girls, josh or zach. all i know right now is it will make money. well lets see, josh and zach, as much as i should be smart enough to walk away, i can't i feel like i still have something to prove or show them like it's too early to say see ya. and they don't care, or are too busy who knows, they don't talk to me. i thought about chicago, and how many contacts i have here, and what i could acomplish before i leave nebraska or josh and zach. i know venues from the ivory star days, we could play weekends and gross a profitable amount of dollars for each weekend. it requires a promoter, posters, a booking agent and a PA that can travle and sound and light people. but i'm prolly the only kid in town who knows all those people and could put this together, so that's been my light at the end of the tunnle, getting me through my desolation blues of deserted avenues. i guess we'd do the benny ford clinic songs, plus the originals i've been writeing, and some more known covers and cooler covers. unsung by helmet is on the list along with foo fighters, vines, franz fer???yep, american hi fi, green day, offspring, jet, things we could stomach, that would make the cash. if done well on the bands part it would pay each band member as good as a shitty full time job, and fund, van, studio, whatever we don't have. and i could have pull the plug open up so that project gets to perform, it's a really good idea. i get to play, and write, and make a living. zach can pay for his wedding, josh can pay off his new car, and we'll still get to work together, and get in the studio. right now i need to hear from the members to know where i stand, other then that, the only obstical is a practice space, which may come along with a new member, or sophia might be able to think of something. so that's where it's at today. and we can still perform in omaha as the benny ford clinic, with the set we do plus originals, with the band fund we can even promote our own shows by renting out the venue we wish to play. well i need sleep, no rest for crotch shots in my mind.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Mon 08/16 01:22    yeah to be honest i don't wanna part ways with zach and josh, but i can't continue the way things are. i consider them brothers and i truely love and adore them as people and musicians, but it's all kinda one way. zach is called one of the best bass players in town, but he gave me his word he'd let down the undecided before me and he's not keeping true to that statement. like his excuss for not being at the meeting will be he had to visit family, so technically it wasn't undecided that kept him from comeing thru. but he had to visit family cause he put undecided shows ahead of family. bottom line he made it to one one meeting in the last 8 months and was unavailable for a countless amount. it seemed like he apreciated all my efforts and i could rely and lean on him being there. josh, well lots of people told me to part ways with him a long time ago, said he looked like a frat boy. didn't hit the drums hard enough, not even in slo childryn. and played all of our songs too slow. when keith played with us he wouldn't practice with us because of josh's drumming. keith said he really liked josh as a person. but he wasn't playing the songs right or even close to good enough. people told me he didn't look right, didn't dress right. and i told all those people to shut up, 'ecause i know people tell josh bad things about me but it seemed we had a respect that we allowed each other to be who we were, without asking the other to change, just because so and so had a harsh opinion about one of us. so one of the saddest things is that josh will never have a chance to prove those people wrong. and both of them will be remembered for being unprofessional and that's one way i don't wanna be remembered. out of all the awful things people can say about the bad things i've done at least i won't be known for being a no show no call. another sad thing is i would have stood by these guys for a long time, and taken better care of them then any other project would, i always gave them what we got paid, many times took money out of my own paychecks to pay them, i moved their gear more than anyother bandmate has or will. and i always put them first. before my sex life, before my family, before my job. i take on all the thought of the band, i contact them set up a meet time, practice time, book a show promote it, all they have to do is show up, play and take the money. i even provided drugs. josh goes to collage and has a job and there was a time when he drove to alot of peoples homes and could have left flyers with those people or a stack at work or put a poster up on campus, but he never did, and that would have paid him more money. zach brought out a few people once or twice. i never asked much of them other then to know they'd be there. any project i conjure in my head i always wanna work with zach and josh, even if i could afford to play with storm and johnny goudie, i still want them as drums and bass. and it breaks my heart that as much as i think about them or put myself in their shoes to understand where they stand. they'd just leave me high and dry. it's benn a different story the other times over the last few months, jeff wasn't avialble or josh or zach. but i had everyone commited this time, and once you've comitted and don't show up or even call. that's perty cruel. they don't understand they make me look like a joke when i have a new guitar player expecting them to show and they don't. i understand we haven't done much as a band lately but, i followed through with everything i said, i was never "full of shit". and look at what i get in return, i don't expect them to match my thought's and consideration, but i do expect what they are capable of and i'm not getting that. and i at least desreve that much. as for rian he's new this is the first time he's let me down. but all three need to step up and be a man, and say i fucked up i do want to work with you benny. or they need to say i have these reasons keeping me from following through. but at this point they're all pussies. and i'll take all this back if someones in jail, a hospital or dead. those are the only reasons for missing a show or practice or meeting, as a no show no call. i always looked up to them 'ecause i thought they were real musicians, 'ecause they had more experience then me. but it's not that way, music is their hobby and it's my life. so i guess i'm the real musician. and after talking with sophia, i can't keep getting jerked around by these boys, i'm going somewhere, she said it she knows it and feels it, so i'm not alone in that thought. and if they can't see it or take things more serious or professional, i need to move on. you can't let stupid people make you stupid, you can't let unprofessional people fuck up yer dream. "we are the dreamers of dreams and we are the music makers" -willy wonka "don't dream it be it" -RHPS / NY Losse's brijette west. it hurts that i've sent so much time energy love a care to these people and i get left so cold. i would have stood by them through anything, but if they can't show up when they said they would they don't deserve it. and i'm not the one who loses. so maybe they'll realize that and do what is needed to keep working together, i have gone to extreme limits for them many times, i've held onto them and beg them to be there, i've praised them and told them there value, and importance to me. well maybe it's my turn to have someone grab ahold of my me and say no! don't go! you can't go! maybe this time they should go to a limit for me. but they won't. they won't even call, not even a cowardly email. so though it hurts me, once i look at that i see they must not be worth it. so yeah if they don't contact me i'll be planning on recording with keith storm troy and keith dudek on drums first choice and todd robertson as a second choice. there's so many musicains in the pile of people who let me down and i always thought these boys were different, but now they're just like the rest. and a year from now i'll be in chicago, and year from then i'll be back here to tell the assholes. and pricks that they are assholes and pricks. and i'll evolve without them. sad days and sad times, when the masks come off.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Sun 08/15 21:14    well i've decieded, all of the benny ford clinic band members are free. all bets are off. i wash my hands. i'll be recording the album with keith storm troy johnson and todd robertson(JRZ System). pressing it and putting ads up in chicago, for real musicians. and hopefully a year from today i'll be living in chicago. i still plan to write with donette this week, and me and johnny james will be working on accoustic songs to play in the old market. if rian zach or josh want to be involved they'll have to make the next move and call me, otherwise i'm moving on. i deserve more than the dust i've collected and the shoebox of excusses. and i'm not about begging for scraps. they're not wasteing my time. they can waste someone else's, and their own. but not mine. i'm not the one who is loseing out on this. actually i thank them for not calling. now i can do what i was ment to.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Sat 08/14 13:18    well i went to the ranchbowl to watch 3qe and undecided. 3qe is a good band for what they are, they're all on the same level with each other, they fit well. undecided, was good. lots of stage movement, the drummer was a bit off, but the band rocked and the show looked good. zach always seems to rock out harder for anyband other then mine, he was really selling the band. makes me wonder why he can't do that with us, i understood why he would for twitch, but this is a band "he's just helping out" which i haven't seen them put any effort into finding another bass player, and zach said he'd let undecided down before the benny ford clinic, but they've been playing a show every weekend since their shey rhiley's show. so well see. but i liked what they did on stage, and the deejay added a sci fi fifties kinda feel to things. the song writting needs to evolve some, but they seem to have a great chemistry. now i can't get a hold of josh, we talked before i left town everything was cool, maybe he dosen't want to see tesla today, i don't know. but he better make it to the meeting sunday. well i woke up late, somebody put somethin in my drink or slipped me somethin i can't say. i need to find a ride to carter lake.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Wed 08/11 02:32    okay i had a long sleep. well we checked into the the hotel, and i roomed with the fatest person as always, i always room with ugly people, that sucks, anyway i don't wanna bore anyone with little details, first day was slow and it down poored and we got soaked. i had my bag in the cab of a semi and i went to get something out and slipped off backwards, scraped my elbows really bad on gravle, i have a huge scab on them now. walked to a laundrymat, washed my clothes and dried my shoes and coat, that was about the best time of my trip at the laundry mat 'ecause i was alone, went back to the room, left called keith bitch about the pricks and shit, he made it better. but it was obvious none of the ames dudes cared for me, but they were assholes so like i cared. the next day started early and all the boys kim favored got 5 hours off, while me and 2 others stayed on, the boys came back and we were free to have our break durring the show, so i took an hour to go swimming, went back to the show to get my dinner ticket from mike (the promoter who is 19 blonde and really nice to look at) well he told me to get to work and i'm like no i'm on my break i wanna eat, he's like your not on break you don't get to eat, there's a storm coming. well i walked ran into kim on the way back to my room, kim like cool someone got a hold of you about the storm, i'm like no i came to get food. no food, no work, and she promised i'd get to eat, and i was like everyone else got 5 hours off, we get paid by the day not the hour that isn't fair, and she said we'll cut the one who didn't get a break early to make it fair. well she came through with food but not the getting cut early, so i worked like 17 hours and got paid for 12. but when the storm hit i was on it like a pro, i had the lightboard covered, and cased, audio amp racks packed, speakers tarped, and the worked on audio cables all with out being told what to do once. but durring the part of breaking down the stage there was a groups of 2s and no one wanted to be teamed with me, and i felt like i was in high school or the last picked on someones team, i was ready to walk. cause i took a short lunch had no dinner and couldn't even smoke while i was doing stage. and there was 6 of us loading stage decks and like 16 people on the ground half working half jerkin around. the only thing that kept me awake was checking out mike's friends they're all on track team and got legs for days, and wore christen shirts that read rooted at the cross, one had huge balls one had a perfect ass. they all had pretty faces that you would come all over. i called them the lightbulb track boys. don't remember their names but i remember them. but the collage boys were meat, and the workers i got along with were the older ones in charge of things. the last half hour i sat on my ass. then we had to leave at 9am so newton could get to work. well came back to ames. the trip home was better cause there was a bit more room in the car to sleep, i woke up and my hand was touching ryans ass but he kept schooching closer, it was weird, cause he wasn't pretty just skinny, but he wanted me to fondle him i'm sure. so weird. came back kims car wasn't ready, started posting here, went to sleep, today it was fixed, we drove 90 mins to get it, took it to a gas station filled it up and gas started gushing everywhere. so another rental car another night in ames. no drugs little cash running low, but kim has fed me well the whole trip, and i have a carton of smokes. but i'm horned up, and i need to get to omaha and apply for a job i really want, so i can pass the piss test and get high. i really wanna get high. z bash on sat, band meeting on sunday, i wanna visted norfolk, but i need to pay some of my debts soon. so fuck i hope my when i post tomorrow it's from omaha. ta ta for now     "Each one of us, in his timidity, has a limit beyond which he is outraged.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Mon 08/09 18:29    okay i'm back in ames, here's the deal last friday the first gig we noticed the car was leaking gas, so we took it to a dealership to have it repaired and got a rental car, well we assumed it was a gas line but it's the tank we learned today, so know we're waiting for it to be repaired, they say prolly tomorrow, but that means more like weds. so that's where the story is at this moment, now i'll go back to the start.   okay we picked up the other loaders me and kim, kim is crew cheif. we'll the other loaders are known as the stonecutter boys, and they're tall lightbulb boys who are skinny but not so pretty. okay well i have some gripes about the whole trip and then we'll talk about the good things and leave on that note.  okay first is brice, he doesn't say much sleeps to the first gig, and theen there's ryan he sits up front with kim and they talk, i can't hear them so i don't get envolved, we go to the show at osceola iowa, at a casino to set up for sara evens, country chick. well it was a pud gig, but there was ideas i had that would have made things better, but no one understood what i was saying till it was set. like they wanted to set up the sound board, well my idea was to take these lids off of cases and use them to support the sound board, but they had it in their heads to use banquet tables, merch tables, ya know folding tables, which isn't strong enough and i'm suprised it held up, well i get a little rudeness like don't undo those cases were setting up the board get them out of the way! and so i do and then we go to lift the board up but they wanna lay it on the floor and take the lid off, but the handle are on the lid, well had i known that i would have said lets put down some thin rack lids first and lay the board down on them so we can get our hands under it and lift, sorry to go on about it but it's common sence and they're being rude to me like yer the new guy, don't think work, i had shit for sleep and planned on sleeping after load in, well we went to the car and learned it had the gas leek and there went all our off time, so i'm hangin with ryan and brice and a nother dude corey, corey is a lard ass football kinda dude, well were sitting on main street while kim runs to the stores she needs, and some "hot little slutty plastic teenage girls" are talkin to the boys and there talkin back and girls leave and they're talking about their asses, and girls or boys that young are stupid not sexy at all, and the dudes having been saying queer, what a fag, that's gay all day in their conversations and i'm just thinking gimme corey parks or a stripper or a hot biker bitch that's sexy, well the girls come back and invite the collage dudes i'm with to some root beer float fund raiser and i say saoftly to ryan as the classic joke unless there's strippers and coke i don't wanna know about it. and he's like that's not very nice. so i'm with some really lame people. so went and ate buffet for dinner. and rian called me and told me he jusst bought a custom les paul, how cool! that's was about the best part of the trip. after dinner i slept for one hour in the car. went toar down and we cramed us four and newton into a car and left for a 6 hour trip, newton is a real lard ass, nicest of all the crew, but i was squished the whole trip and learn there's no smoking in the rental car. now brice is between us he can't sit on his ass only his tail bone and has his long legs takeing up all the room, and he talks with a BIG vocabulary like he can't talk in normal words he has to use bigger words to show everyone he's better then him, i'm like big deal yer parents bought you a vocab, so i got irritated and just listened to head phones cause the cd's they played were not entertaining.so we check into our hotel in st croiux. i'll finish later. i'm tired right now.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Thu 08/05 18:38    well i'm in ames today, it's been a nice couple days of vacation, even though i've been unemployeed for a while, when i'm in omaha i constantly have to worry about finding a job or quick cash, rent stress ect, so here i don't need to worry about a thing other then band meeting and practicing. so i've been working on lyrics and ideas. this town reminds me of lincoln i'm infamous in lincoln, but i've been real good and staying in the house, you have to smoke outside, so i see all these dudes, they all look the same tall white khacki shorts baseball caps, walking around, and the boyscouts are in town they look like little nazi armys. i watched weird science on vhs, it's nice to see the movie unedited, kelly labrock is one of the hottest women ever, attitude has alot to do with it, i realize she reminds me of me alot. well, i'm gonna go shower and buy smokes and play poker. try to finish a few of the songs i started. rest up, early role call tomorrow. i don't wanna think too much about the work this weekend. just do it as it comes. i'm gonna miss eevilsquad friday, and surreal and buck bowen sat, and phunk junkeez sunday, that blows but i'll have a place to live still, so there ya go. i talked with a mentor of minee, he said to stay focused and i can do any thing i try to, be good to myself and the ones around me, and that he is proud of me, i guess he's kinda the closest thing to a father i ever had, so to here that makes me feel, well not acomplished, but not a waste of efforts. okay i'm off now. ciao    "Each one of us, in his timidity, has a limit beyond which he is outraged.

      Post By: lunchbox benny Sun 08/01 21:06    well i met rian, well i feared he might be a fatass or somethin' don't know why. just did. well he's actually somewhat of a chic magnet i guess you could say. the girls like him so that's a good start. he has a girlfriend who doesn't get jealous of his guitar, and understands there's times when the band comes before her, so that's a plus. his mom supports him and the idea of being a musician. he liked nashville pussy, who in their right mind wouldn't. he has a 73 les paul, a strat, soon maybe an sg, he plays drums, bass, violin, mandalin. he has something i can use for a vocal p.a. he's gonna get a cabnit soon, he has most of the cash. he brought an accoustic and he's plays better then any 16 year old i've seen. he writes good guitar parts, they're not like perfect out of the gate, but i can write along with them and we can beef up improve what we need to, a good start that's all you can ask for. his lyrics are good but real simple, words and whatnot. and he's really gonna be impressed with how i write i can see that now. he has a garage to practice in. he has a friend with 70,000 studio in his basement. and he's really dedicated, and willing to work for this, so it's cool, cause i take on all the worry and strees of finding the solutions for the band, and here's someone who will aleaviate me of some of that. his grandpa even runs a car lot that sells vans. so he's really a releif to me in so many ways. there's more cool things about him but i have to go now. to be continued....

      Post By: lunchbox benny Sat 07/31 23:45    well after i got myself in a huff about band shit i realized there's something we need. it's kinda my fault, and i'm responsible to provide this first before we can take over the world. so i need to deal with that fast. it's a full moon i always get an extra ounce of fire in me when it's a full moon. so i didn't hear from rian yesterday, and i was like great. here. we. go - again. and tried to call him today. so i was like great one more that didn't surface. i go thru guitar players like they go thru strings. man you should see the pile of em. but yeah i just got a call from rian and he had family illness, and such, so we meet tomorrow afterneoon. i meet his mom too, i hope she likes my nashville pussy dvd. well john jensen is gonna be handleing the lead parts of the band till he goes on tour. that is if i don't get evicted in the process. and i think i'll ask rian for a bit of cash till i get employeed. i'm thinkin red lobster fer sure shot. maybe rainbow on center for work, apac is cool but i realized i'm a week late on that so w.c.s. dial america. vip caar wash. it's good rian is talkin to me cause no one else is. i think sophia might be busy or sick of me, not sure. surreal is fed up with my shit, zache and josh would talk to me on the phone let alone hang. and roomates are on the verge as always. it almost seems like when i was in school. you have no choice but to walk thru halls and halls of people who aren't so thrilled with you. so yeah the hurricane never stops. wow hu geees. what a life.
