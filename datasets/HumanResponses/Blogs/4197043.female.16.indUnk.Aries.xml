      Sorry I haven't posted int he past few days. My computer has been acting up. I started school on Thursday it was a half day.I have Mr. Smith for Latin...first hour. I really would have preferred him for sometime later in the day. I really don't like him. He's too philisophical and just utterly full of it. To top it off he's a hypocrite. He says he wants us to be involved in plays and broaden our horizons, so to speak, but when it comes to doing something for drama he puts up a fight about letting me out of class. He also shows favoritism, and as you could probably tell, I'm not his favorite in anyway. He's an evil teacher, he gave a test today, the SECOND day of school. We haven't even learned anything yet.My second hour is Chemistry. It looks pretty fun, and we have computers at each table. Third hour is Art II I have that class with Ronnie so it's going to be fun. I already have all of my supplies since I always buy extra pencils and artpads everytime I'm at the store. Fourth hour is Algebra II, I don't care for math too much, but she's a nice teacher.I'm not in the honor class, and I was going to switch into it until Chelsea told me that the teacher stunk at cheating and it would be easier to just stay with the normal class. She was a math genius and she was passing Mrs. Hanson's class with a C or D so yea I'm going to stick with normal Algebra. Fifth hour is American History. He is HILARIOUS. The whole period today he had Chelsea and me dying out on the floor laughing. He's great, he so sarcastic it's funny.He's going to be a fun, but hard class.Last class is English III. I don't care much for this class either. It's alot of work not that I mind that, I'm just somewhat of a procrastinator so I have alot to do. I am in the process of reading sparknotes on Alas Babylon since I didn't read the actual book this summer. Eheh, my bad. I'm probably going to skim them sometime this weekend.Also for her class, I have to write an essay on my personality. This'll be easy and hard at the same time, if that makes sense.That's due on Monday. Wednesday I have a collage on Alas Babylon due and I have to explain why I made it the way I did...I have to read a bit of the book to do that I guess. So I'm getting started on all of this after I finish typing up this blog. I haven't talk to Flare in forever, and its kinda starting to make me sad.  I can't download MSN yet so I haven't been able to talk to him. ~sigh~ Sarah is going off to college so I won't see her for a long while cause she won't have internet either. I went to see a movie with William again today. We saw Without a Paddle, it's a great movie. I laughed the whole time. Then we went to Bennigans and I felt bad because Chelsea had been called into work since I quit. She was really mad at me I could tell, but she said it was okay. She hadn't known I'd quite during the school year, and thought I just didn't want to come to work. William and I had an odd lil talk during the meal, he thought he'd creeped me out earlier when he asked in the theatre that if I ever did like him like a boyfriend if we could go out, cause he's been trying for about a year, and is getting kinda desperate. I told him it didn't then he went on this spill about Chelsea turning him down, and know he was going to go out with Jake. So I tried to help him figure out what to do from there, but I'm at a loss as to what to do. Anyways I'mma go get crackin' on my homework now.

        I am so tired right now. I'm about to pass out and die.I still haven't read that book for school, but the test won't be till next week so I think I'm good. Ehn, the computer is still being weird. I'm going to have to get Pappito to fix it. Ugh, I don't want to go to school right now...I just wanna sleep tomorrow, and I have to work after school. I REALLY hope Dad can get someone to cover my shift Friday. I'm going to die if I have to work.I think I'm going to stop working during the school year. I won't have time to do anything. Well Jessica is breaking up with Jake so that's a godsend so to speak. I don't really like him. Letsee, William and I went to Bennigans, and we ordered Chelsea some cheesesticks and ate. Chelsea and Jake Riley(not Jessica's Jake) are probably going to go out.William got a little ticked about that cause he had asked her out months and months before and she had turned him down. We talked about the usual during the meal, about boyfriends and girlfriends and the like. I think he's getting a little depressed about being single. I know how he feels though. I was going insane as well.~sigh~ I dunno what do to for him. He asked me at the wrong time, but  I really wouldn't go out with him anyway. I see him more as a friend than anything else. I really hate to see him down in the dumps about all this, but..eh there's really nothing I can do for the kid. Eric didn't bug me today thank goodness....He got sick and had to leave. Sarah and I couldn't really work on the Auditorium because they were laying down tile on that stupid ramp. Oh well, I'll help them out after school, since its a half day I'll just stay down there and then get a ride to work. Meh, I'm not ready to go back to school....I want another week off. ~Sigh~

      I got the title from a song I'm listening too. Anyways, sorry I haven't posted in the past few days the computer is being weird. Less than two days before school starts, major stinkage. Um, lessie I went to see Alien vs. Predator.It was pretty good. I like the Aliens. They are like cute lil killer puppies of death.Today I went to work got my paycheck. Woot! It was $142.06. I'm  not quite sure how much that means I have saved towards my laptop just yet, but I guess I'll count it all out after I cash it.I still need to buy that Wolf's Rain DVD. I got to see Sarah today, that was fun. She picked me up after work so we could go clean up the auditorium cause the losers who built that stupid handicap ramp messed it up majorly bad. Not that building a handicap ramp is bad or anything but the only reason they built it is because this crazy woman filed a lawsuit because we couldn't put her vegitable of a child in drama.So they tore some curtains ripped a hole in the sike...just to get this stupid ramp in. No one is going to be using it o.o. No one ever goes in the auditorium, save for me and Sarah.They pushed all of our old set pieces out towards the front of the stage making a big crowed mess, so today after work I went to help Sarah clean up. She's actually the only reason I joined Drama. So I could help her out with stuff so she wouldn't have to work so hard. That all went pretty well, but the place was caked with dust, and now I'm not feeling so hot.After that we went to Bennigans to eat. She had a virgin mudslide and I had a virgin margaritta since we can't buy alcohol yet, not that I'd drink it or anything. It smells horrible, and things like that normally taste like they smell. Eric Harper kept hanging around us the entire time we ate, it was really annoying. He made a very interesting comment, about something Sarah said. He had recorded something on his phone, that he's oh so proud of, and it was a recording himself saying sarah in a really weird voice. Well the only part she heard was a really odd sounding uh..and yea..she was like" Woah now..that sounds wrong. Blah blah blah" Then he made the comment while looking at me leaning over on my side of the booth," I could be good ya never know." I looked over at her and we both died out laughing. Mine was a partly annoyed laugh, after that we left.We went to my house and she played with my kitty, Eclipse.We called Cursey on the phone, and I talked to him for a while. This was my first time talking to him and he figured out it was me in less than two minutes.All that dust is making me feel sick now, but that's okay I'm listening to Evanescence, hence the title of my journal. Anyways I'm done posting so yea till next time.

        I'm in shreveport again. I'm visiting Lindsay for her b-day party today. I came over yesterday afternoon after my horseback riding lessons. I did okay on those. I'm getting a little better, but I messed up a lot this time because I had a wider horse. I think I'd do better on a thinner horse. Anyways, after that mom drove me down to Minden, I slept the whole way>.>...Then Lindy and her parents picked me up. Lindsay and I slept the whole way home. Zach and Arthur came over and they taught me how to play D&amp;D(Fun stuff, Fun stuff) We didn't get to finish our little campaign because it was getting late. Zach said Lindsay should be an epherial tree that bears hamburger fruit. We joked around with that for forever. Then we finally started playing. It was so fun. I'm going to have to find someone to play that with in West Monroe.I was so tired last night I missed the Wolf's Rain episode ~cries~ By one minute! I waited and waited for Inuyasha to end and right when it did I fell asleep! Grrr...Oh well I'm going to buy all the DVD's anyway. We went to Sam's and bought roses and such for the party. I bought a new Evanescence CD since my last one had a horrible death. Arthur is making flower arrangements for the thing and I fixed people's hair. I really want to draw something. I've been in an art slump for about two weeks and it is bugging me. I have all these good ideas I want to draw, but when I start to put them on paper they just get fubarred. ( I love that word)~sigh~Anyways........I don't know whatelse to put. I wanna talk to Flare u.u....I haven't seen him since Thursday night, but I mean we both work so sometimes we miss each other. Maybe he'll read this blog, and yea that'll be good enough? I might send him an email later just saying hey. It's kinda weird..after all the bad things I've had happen to me in a relationship, I never thought I'd want another one so soon, but I do o.o. It's weird and I'm weird..so yea. I'm waiting for Zach to come over so we can finish playing, but its almost party time so maybe I'll see him there. We are going to some Chinese restaruant, which is kinda cool. Ooo, I like Lindsay's keyboard. I can be all fast with the typing and it makes the cool clicky noises....

      Wow...I'm so tired. I guess I shouldn't have gone to bed at three thirty this morning. Bourne Supremecy was an okay movie. We weren't really paying attention. The gang was too busy goofing off in the back of the theatre. Chelsea came up with this really special inside joke with me about Ronnie and tiny fuzzy hats. It cracks me up.I can't exactly remember what went on but they were laughing at me the whole night. I was delusional from lack of sleep. We went to Chelsea's afterwards and hung out...they pinned me under a bean back chair and it too me FOREVER to get from under it. I still have to read Alas Babylon. I guess I'll force myself to start tonight. I'll come home after work, and take a nap, then read when i wake up.I have till the 19th I believe.William wanted to see Alien vs. Preadator today, but since it just came out I douubt we'll get in. I really need to talk to Jessica, but she's off with Jake in Maine. I hop she comes back soon.....I really need to get this off my chest and figure everything out.I can't believe she did this. But...then again I can. ~sighs irritatedly~ No...not going to talk about it...nope...nuh uh.Anyways. I haven't been able to draw anything...makes me sad. I've tried drawing whole bunches of stuff, but it hasn't turned out well. I need to set the scanner up and post some of my art on DeviantArt.

        Last night wasn't cool.Cursey wasn't in a good mood last night. No one seemed to be in  a good mood last night for that matter.Cursey was sad because his fiance's parents made them break up. I suppose its because he's about to go off to fight in the war, but that's just mean. Anyways for some reason or another I ended up feeling down about it all.I have not been having a good week. I haven't been able to draw anything decent because of it all either. Alot of my friends have been coming onto me about liking me, and they won't stop about it, which is really starting to bug me on top of everything else. I'm nice about it though..I'm not snapping anyone's head off because of it. I just want it all to stop.~Sighs~Moving onto better things now. My favorite artist is back on DeviantArt. She got ticked from all the people stealing her artwork and went on hiatus for a while, she's been posting journals on DA so I'm happy she's back somewhat. Hopefully some time in the future I can ask her for an art trade.Her artwork is awesome and I would feel extremely honored if she did something for me. I'm going to see Bourne Idenity with the gang today(Chelsea, Ronnie, and Kasey.) at four something so I'll probably just stay up at work till they get to the theatre. I'll probably end up falling asleep in it. I've been so dead lately, but that's okay. Mom said it wasn't the best, but that it was good. William wants me to go see P2 with him on Friday. Only reason I'm seeing it is because I'm in love from the Aliens,and have watched the Alien and Predator series a hundred billion times since I'm was a kid. I'll be a bit upset if this movie is gay, but it looks like it has some good animation to it.Anyway I'm off to work...later.

        Well, this is my first time having a blog. So I'm not quite sure what to put on it. This weekend I got really tiffed at someone, but I'm not going to go into that. It'll just get me mad again, and I don't feel like being mad today. Three days of it is enough. I went to see The Village last night with William, a friend from school. It was a really stupid movie. We'd gone to the mall before that, and I got an awesome poster from Spencer's. I went to Hot Topic and saw a few shirts I wanted. They had this really neat looking Evanescence shirt, and a A Perfect Circle shirt that I wanted. Oh, I also bought this book filled with blank pages so I can start writing a story using all my RPG characters. I designed each of them to fit together with each other. Anyways enough about that. I need to go back to the mall in a few days to get the second Wolf's Rain DVD. I really like that show. Some people don't like it because it's too serious and kinda boring to them. I like it though, I'm a real big wolf freak so seeing an anime completely devoted to wolves that are actually drawn and animated really good is awesome. The first DVD I bought of Wolf's Rain came with a Kiba plushie. It's so cute and chibified.( Is that even a real word?)It also came with the sound track. I'm hoping this next DVD has a box set with a poster or something and a new plushie. I really want a Blue plushie cause she's the best character off that show. Enough about that, after I buy that DVD I need to save the rest of my money to buy a laptop. This computer just isn't cutting it anymore. I'm also need to hook my scanner up so I can upload some new pictures on it. I have a project I want to do. I wanted to draw anthro versions of the Chinese Zodiac. It would be a whole lot of fun and I'd get some good practice with drawing different animals, besides wolves. Anyways the cookies are done cooking so I'm going to grab me some! Later!
