      Quote of the Day (ok so it was actually from a month ago but I just read it today)  "The way things are going in fashion, there will soon be nothing left for prostitutes to wear."                                                                                                   - Bill Maher                                                                                                  Wow! Bill Maher?? If even he sees it then what's wrong with the rest of America?

      OK well it's over. Yesterday was one of the most nerve racking experiances of my life. I'm not sure what was so difficult about it really.  I mean I've spoken quite a bit, and actually enjoy getting up in front of a crowd. I think the difference is that this time I had to follow a format and knew that everyone in the class was going to be looking to see how well I followed the formula.   At any rate I felt the whole preaching experiance was less then enjoyable. I felt to nervous and it totally affected my delivery. Oh well, fortunatly I don't have to do that every day. Having it behind me will allow me to move on to other things. And i have learned a lot from it.

       “Smells like Birthday Parties”  - Heather                      “Ahhhhh . . . The sound you make at the end of a hard days work, that or right after you drink a big tall glass of iced tea.     Since I’m not a tea drinker I’m going to have to go with the former. Got a lot done at work today, very satisfying, it was a great day.                      The morning was ok, I had an MSRG (Ministry Support and Reflection Group) it’s for a class I’m taking in Seminary. Since I have kind of an unusual job, the team is also kind of unusual (the make up of the team that is, they are all very normal people). It is supposed be a group of lay people that see you minister on a regular basis, usually in a church setting. However I work with a group of churches (about 120), so even the folks I share an office with don’t see what I do most of the time. So it’s kind of hard in that respect, but I tried to get some folks that knew me, so it’s been ok so far.                The meetings consist of me talking to them about what I did the last month or so for about 20 min, then they tell me the areas of my life I need to improvement, as well as the things that I’m doing well. It’s a pretty fair group, if anything they are a bit generous. Yet it is impossible to come out of the meeting with out feeling a bit defensive. I have to remind myself, that A) I asked for the criticism and b) they really are just trying to help. I’m never upset with any of them, but it’s hard to hear your faults, even when you know that it’s true. The big thing that they hit on today was not a news flash at all: I need to work on my grammar. (no wise cracks!) I’ve known this since 11th grade English with Mr. Boudino. Generally a nice guy he was white haired with a white long goatee, could have passed for a bitnick in his day I’m sure. He forced us to read “The Sun also Rises”, still the worst book I’ve ever read, and told me that my grammar would flunk me out of college. I was very tempted to mail him a copy of my diploma upon my graduation! However, part of me knew that he was half right and I still need to work on it; all that to say, I’m going to let Coqui check my papers and letters before they are turned in or sent out. She said “You know I love to do that kind of stuff.” What?? I honestly didn’t know anybody enjoyed that stuff. People actually enjoy editing others grammar? This is news to me. I’m not sure how anyone can enjoy it, but I’m glad they exist. So here’s to you Coqui!                         So after the meeting I had lunch with Jack and Mike, both of whom are youth ministers I work with and buddies of mine as well. We talked about their various ministries and some other random things, but the fun part came at the end of the meal. We were talking about a church that had recently sold some property, some rather prime real estate in fact, to a Mormon church. The kicker of the thing was that there was an evangelical church in the area that had made a reasonable offer on the land. I was appalled that any church would literally sell out a sister church like that for money, especially to an enemy of the Gospel like the Mormon church. I made my distain known at the table, so I’m sure those around us could hear. Long story short as the table beside us got up to leave I noticed that one of the 2 young men wearing black coats had on a name tag. One of those balck name tags you usually see on two young guys in white shirts riding bikes, or walking down the street. YEP, I’m about 90% certain that they were Mormons! I think they were like Secret agent Mormons though cause they had on black coats. Then again it was kind of cold out. We laughed about it, not sure whether we were actually offensive or not in our conversation.                    I went back to the office and got a LOT done on my sermon. I still have some fine tuning and details to get worked out, but it’s looking pretty good. This is great because I still have to write a10 page paper, a book report, and edit a journal. It was also the first time in a while that I’ve spent this much time trying to work on one passage for a sermon. There is nothing as exciting as teaching God’s word when you have a message from Him that you’ve been able to workout and prepare well. Truly one of the joys of my life is standing in front of an audience, knowing that God has a message for them and you get to share it. It’s a very gratifying!!                   Then the real fun part of the day kicks in. Just as I’m about to wrap up my study’s and head for home; Heather, a friend from church, calls and wants to hang out. I’m all up for it as Heather is always fun to hang with and I want to check out some CD’s. And yes Heather is just a friend (sorry Mom). In fact most of the evening revolves around talking about her boyfriend Christopher, also a friend from church, who is in Spokane doing some work. I had such a blast just hanging out, not a dull moment.                                   We went by the greatest of all American stores, Best Buy, so many toys so little time. I got the New Jars O’clay CD and a Cademon’s CD.     No idea if they are any good yet, I’ll keep ya posted. Then we were off to Old Navy, Target, Coach House Gifts, and Quiznos/Taco Time, all located in the mall. Got some good deals at Old Navy, how is it Heather was the one that needed to go, but she didn’t even buy anything, while I got some PJ pants and a Fleece?                  We then ate dinner, me finishing most of my sub before Heather even takes a bite out of her first taco. Mid way through her 2nd taco she wonders aloud why I always seem to ask her questions when she’s taking a bite of her Taco. To which I retort, cause that’s the only time you pause long enough for me to get in a sentence. She starts to refute the statement while chewing, but realizes the truth behind before she can finish the bite. We discuss more of Christopher, a bit of video games and then head to Coach house Gifts.                 Heather is looking for some candles when she runs across Butter Cream. She hands me the candle and says  “um smells like Birthday Parties.”                                                 Well that is it smell like cake, and no birthday party is complete w/o a Birthday cake.      So it smells like Birthday parties! I love moments like that, they make me laugh.   To conclude the evening I went home where I watched the latest episode of Survivor, taped of course so no boring commercials, one of only two shows which I try not to miss each week.  Ok well off to Bed, the completion of a wonderful day!

        This is hysterical to me.    urlLink koin.com : " urlLink DARE  Dumps  urlLink Trail Blazers      Anti-Drug Program No Longer Accepts Tickets       (Italics added by me)   PORTLAND  -- The anti-drug program DARE has cut its ties with the Portland Trail Blazers. The Blazers have provided free game tickets for children, but DARE officials say they're not going to accept them until some of the players clean up their acts.         All kidding aside this is almost a no brainier. ( For those that don't follow the NBA the team has had several run-ins where players have been busted for Drug possession among other violations. My personal favorite was when Damon Stoutamire tried to smuggle his Pot through the airport wrapped IN TIN FOIL!!)   'We are about making good choices and picking role models. And the kids are pretty keen -- they don't get a lot past them,' DARE educator Deputy Mike Olds told KOIN 6 News.             Mike also invited all the reporters over for milk and cookies, but told them that Wally and the Beav had home work finish before they couls come out and play. (Keen??  Really? They still use that word?)   Team officials would not comment on the DARE program but pointed out that other community groups, such as the  Portland Police Activities League , support the team. "           Yeah, because they are on a first name basis with so many of the players! I mean ya gotta have some kind of job security.

      A Youth Ministry icon passed away last week, Mike Yaconelli he was the founder of  urlLink Youth Specialties  an organization that has helped youth leaders change the lives of students for decades. I have personally benifitted greatly from the conferances, and materials Mike and YS put together. Mike you'll be missed by many, thanks for all you've done for so many of us.     MICHAEL CHARLES YACONELLI July 24, 1942 - October 30, 2003  "If I died right this minute, I would be able to say, 'God, what a ride! What a ride!'"  Mike, YS Convention, Charlotte, 10/24/03     Doug Fields (the Youth minster at SaddleBack) wrote a great article that pays a wonderful tribute to this follower of Christ.  urlLink "The day my friend died: a tribute to Mike Yaconelli"

      Why???  Why, don’t all teams run the 2 minute offense the whole game? I watched back to back games where the team with the ball seemed to just move the ball at will in the 2 min. offense.  I watched the Redskins score at will at the end of the half against my second favorite team, the Seahawks, and now the Carolina Panthers score on like 4 plays against Tampa. (By the way if you didn’t see the McCardell catch watch sports center, BEST CATCH OF THE YEAR. Simply Amazing.)      Is it the Defense or what? Also my Razorbacks exhibit the same trait. In 2 games this year doing nothing until the 4th and then throwing up 2-3 touch downs in about 5 min. Truly a mystery of Life!  WhAT!!! Now they tell me they aren’t allowed to show me the end of the GAME!!! What kind of stupid league rule says you can’t watch a game past :15 after the hour? I swear I’ll go postal if Tampa comes back with a minute left. Crazy day, back to school work.

      Was reading this article on Mike Price (Bama football coach that was fire for being in the strip clubs), came across this quote:  "I think I can still motivate and lead people,' Price told the newspaper.  Price said he continues to look for a job in college football or the National Football League.  Uhh no you can't, sorry Mike. Even if it didn't happen quite the way SI reported you forfeited your character that evening. And it's hard to follow a man w/o Character.

      Ahhhh. Is there anything in the world more satisfying then checking off the final thing on your check list???  Well, I'm not there yet but the journey has begun with the finishing of the first of several projects and it's quite encouraging!  OK back to the grind stone.   Quote of the day comes from the verse that I think I have memorized for the week:  Ephesians 2:10   "For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God has prepared in advance for us to do."    By the way quite a good verse to memorize when your not sure where life is headed. Was a good reminder to me this week that God has stuff prepared just for me. Makes you feel needed. (and yes I understand that God doesn't NEED me for anything, )   oh  yeah Hogs won 28-6 which now makes us Bowl eligeable.     The privilage of being bowl eligable is about equal to that of making your high school football team. All ya gotta do is be able to put one foot in front of the other and show up to the game. Bring on the play-off system!!!!

      The Matrix Revolutions (WARNING The major plot lines in the movie are reveled, well the 2 min. that weren't part of the preview anway.)      If your going to the theater and want to go see a good movie check out ELF, or that new Hugh Grant movie, or better yet just hold your money and see "The Return of the King" twice. Revolutions while very good visually, in fact I'd say the best of the three, lacks any kind of real draw! As one critic said: 	‘ . . . while "Reloaded" and "Revolutions" might be technically proficient, they are largely devoid of the kind of wonder and storytelling that hooked us the first time. Simply put, the Wachowskis ran out of good ideas, and they isolated themselves so no one could point out their indulgence.”  The Whojahoski brothers (I donÂt care how they spell it) seriously disappoint us. All three movies lead up to answering the question of fate vs. free will. At the end of a decent fight scene between Hugo Weaving (who was the lone bright spot in the movie) and Neo, Weaving beggs the question why do you continue to fight? He throws out some great answers like Courage, honor, love, etc. etc. And Keanu in all his greatness says: “Because I choose too” .  What?? That’s it? Like hey I felt like having a tuna sandwich today. I’d like to be a dentist instead of an optometrist. What are you talking about? You choose too?!!!!! That’s your reason for saving the world? Wow, that’s Keanu at his best I suppose. There were a lot of other things that were messed up with the movie, but that was the most disappointing line in the whole series.   The other thing that was very disappointing was the fact that they called a truce. What?? Does anyone else see this as a huge problem? I mean how long is it going to take before the humans demand that the machines let their people go? The machines obviously can’t because that would mean they have no power and therefore all die. HELLLOOO! HUGE flaw in the plot there.   Anyway, the special effects were pretty cool and also much more seemless then in Reloaded. But I think the movie as a whole jsut doesn't ring true. The movies overall message just falls flat. I mean hey nothing gets you through the day like well I chose to. That is what gives me meaning, he might as well have said I think therefore I am or some other load of crap like that.   See it if your dying to know what happens other wise borrow your neighbors copy when your bored next summer.

      Wow, this is truly a sick addiction. But hey it's the flavor of the month and at least for now it tastes really good! Anyway, the world is truly small. As I was surfing some other blogs today I went to a link on  urlLink Coqui 's site ( urlLink jason ) read it for a bit and as I was checking out his links I see a name that is the same as that of a buddy from college. Surely this isn?t the same I thought but I don?t know many John Barbers and sure enough there he was in all his urlLink  Barberman  blogging greatness. Anyway it was cool to see small world.  If I continue this I?m absolutely going to have to get some pictures on this thing, but that requires money and before I go throwing around cash (yeah I know $5 a month or whatever isn?t a lot) I have to be sure I?m going to stick with it at least on a semi-consistent basis.   Tonight is an exciting night as my  urlLink Razorbacks  are playing on National TV. Living in Seattle it?s kind of hard to catch a team from Ark on the TV.  So in about 15 min they?ll be playing the Gamecocks.  They?ve had a very up and down season. But here is hoping they win out and make a decent Bowl.  For those of you not from Ark. The University of Arkansas is THE TEAM in Arkansas. If you live anywhere in the State you?re REQUIRED to root for the Hogs. Since we don?t have any professional teams, the college kids get all the love. It?s good times.    In fact Coqui, who is in my office bemoaning the Hawgs Illustrated (yep it?s an actual magazine) that she has to sort through and make sure I get each week, is a prime example of those that ?don?t get it?. It?s like New York and the Yankees, Chicago and the Cubs, Dallas and the Cowboys, or yeah ok sorry don?t have any non sports illustrations; if you live there though you have to follow the team. So I?m headed home to watch the Razorbacks.   Oh yeah the Basketball team is actually better then the football team. Ok well not this year, but give them a couple and the back to back top 5 recruiting classes they have coming in will be in full effect! Stan Heath will be coach of the year in '05 just put it down.

      "Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will  fearlessly  make known the mystery of the gospel, 20 for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it  fearlessly , as I should."  Eph 6:19-20 (NIV)  As I'm studying for a sermon I have to preach for my preaching class. (preaching to your peers by the way is one of the most nerve racking things you can do). I ran across this passage and just really like it a lot. The word "fearlessly" hit a cord with me this morning. It sounds so reckless, and uninhibited. Love that passage, probably gonna memorize it, and stick it somewhere or something.  Also I'm reading the  Purpose Driven Life  by Rick Warren. It's a great book. Very simple in it's concepts, but also very profound in drawing your attention back to the purpose of life. I'm only on the 4th day (our church started it a bit late), but I highly recommend the book.   2 Quotes for the day -  "It ought to be the business of everyday to prepare for our final day" - Matthew Henry (via The Purpose Driven Life)                Today talked about living life with eternity in mind. This pretty much summed up the whole chapter.  "Guys don't want to know what's on TV, guys want to know what else is on TV." - Jerry Sienfeld

      Well ya gotta start somewhere so why not here? I started to change the name, but I think it fits the way life feels right now. I'd like to be creative and thoughtful, but I just feel like I'm in too much of a hurry to really mess with it. When the mood changes so will the name, at least until I find something that fits.  A little info about me. I'm a 27 year old part time seminary student. I work in the Seattle area (in the same office as Coqui), I help resource Youth Ministers and start Campus (Jr. and Sr. High school) Outreach Clubs. I also co-ordinate 3-4 big events a year. I work for and am funded by the Southern Baptist Convention.   I'm proud to be a Baptist, but it's not like I think we invented the Bible or anything. I'm fully aware that we have done some stupid things (see Disney boycott) and are far from perfect, but we do a good job at missions and try our best to live out the teachings of Christ.   I grew up in Springdale, Arkansas (Go Hogs!). Graduated from Ouachita (pronounced wash-it-aw) Baptist University in 1999 and spent a couple of years in Dallas, TX. Before god Delivered me to beautiful Seattle, WA. I absolutely love it in Washington. I miss my family, but that's about it. It's a great place to do ministry, with a lot of needs.  Anyway, Seminary is kicking my butt right now. As in I have about 4 assignments that are overdue, sooooo I gotta get to work.  Oh yeah I miss Texas High School Football too. Just not the same here in Washington.  (did I mention I'm a big sports fan? More on that later.)  gotta run

      Ok yeah I might actually ramble a bit more on this but I figured I'd go ahead and post the quote of the day.  Our winner today comes from just down the office  "It is important - rather indispensable - to have Baptist stickers on all things. " -  urlLink Coqui    Definatly one of the funnier stories I've read in a long time.

      Home is  . . . .   They always say home is where the heart is, so if your homeless is then does that mean your heartless as well?  Why is the starting plate called Home plate in Baseball?  What about dogs?   What is just the right amount of time to be at home with out getting sick of it?   I missed that window this year. Although I was expecting to see a few more friends then what  I have. I'm ready to catch a flight this afternoon. I want to go home! Seattle home that is. Here's the kicker though. I've really enjoyed my visit. I loved getting to see the Family. But 2 weeks is well . . . too long. Anyway, the trip has been fun. I'm going to try and study a little bit, but I'm sure I'll wind up back with my latest addiction (the Sims).

        Gracefully kissing your knee   	 	Well I arrived in Tulsa yesterday after what seemed like the shortest six hours of travel in my life! I grabbed King of Torts by Grisham on my way through the airport and simply couldn’t put it down. Nothing better then grabbing a good Grisham book after a semester of forced theological reading (not that seminary’s not great, but books are better when a grade is not attached to their reading). Tulsa is about 90 miles east of my hometown of Springdale, AR. Tulsa is also the home of my sister Diane, her husband Chris, and my two nieces Olivia (almost 5), and Annika (3 months). They just moved in to a beautiful new home, and as such we will be spending Christmas with them in their home! My mom met me at the airport and informed me that I would be attending Olivia’s ballet recital that evening (which was actually more of a rehearsal with parents watching). Normally I’m not a huge fan of the ballet, but I’d go watch basket weaving if my niece were involved so I was perfectly happy! So after a brief stop by the house, we all loaded up and went to the rehearsal. It was a small studio and there were only 4 students and the teacher Mrs. Lynn. This was the first time I’ve ever watched ballet, other then the few times I may have run across it on PBS and quickly turned the channel. I came away very much impressed though in several areas. To start Mrs Lynn was sooooo graceful and beautiful in her dance. Her she was a lady probably in her late 40’s and she would run the children through the various exercises of basically swing your leg around from one place to another and moving your arm in and out. But Mrs. Lynn had such control and balance grace when she did it. It was very beautiful! The first time I really appreciated that form of dance. Mrs. Lynn was helped by the fact that 4 and 5 year olds are not ummm  . . . well . . . graceful, not yet anyway. In fact they often lose focus, and pick their nose or stare into space. Essentially, Mrs. Lynn was like a football coach that is instilling discipline into his team. She would gently correct the students by name correcting their movements, which they often still didn’t grasp, and reaffirmed then if by chance they did make the correct change. (Lot’s of spiritual analogies I don’t have time for right now that I saw in this small class.) It was neat though I enjoyed it.  The highlight of the afternoon for me was toward the end. They were doing some stretching exercises. Sitting on the floor in a sort of splits position (ok well Mrs. Lynn made it there, the girls did their best) the goal was for them to touch their head to their knees. Mrs. Lynn asked them to kiss their knee, and then demonstrated, by slowly stretching and kissing her knee, one knee and then the other. They did this about 3-4 times each knee.  Now the knee was supposed to flat on the ground, and many of the other girls being unable to kiss their knee on the ground would lift their knee and kiss it that way. No shame in that. But Olivia, did the coolest thing ever! Not being able to reach her knee either and in fact not being able to reach it by a good distance, she did what your supposed to do when your far away from something you want to kiss. She blew it. She leaned as far as she could, kissed her hand, and blew her knee a kiss!  It’s good to be home!

      I'm Done! Ok well I'm done for the semester. Well I don't have to got to school till Jan 8th. But like any student who is given the option I chose not to finish all my papers. Therefore I will attempt to finish them before the start of next semester! Sometimes deadlines are good! Oh well you get what ya sow!  I'm heading home in 2 days! Be visiting the great state of Arkansas for about 2 weeks! I get to see my family and some old friends. Should be a great time! But I still have almost all my Christmas shopping to do. Including a few more gifts for some friends here before I leave!   I had probably one of my favorite Christmas moments about a week ago. I was over at a friends house and we exchanged gifts (nothing huge, but still fun) ate some snacks, chatted a bit, then watched a movie while sipping on hot coco. It was all candle lit and very warm. I felt comfortable, free to be me, and loved.

      I’m behind, but I guess my blog shouldn’t be any different from the rest of my life. I wrote a really long post a week or so ago, but it was pretty whinny and well I hate it when people whine, so I didn’t want to bother you with my whining. Anyway, just know it had to do with married (or nearly married) people giving single people advice on being ok with your “singleness”. - Spare Me.   I resolved this year not to make any new years resolutions! Well at least not till February, I have not real reason for this other then I just didn’t feel like it in Jan. the verdict is still out on Feb. But the reality is I have this covenant thing I have to get to working on so really I think I’ll just try and make that work. Oh yeah, also I’m going to spend less, eat better, work out more, and work on growing closer to Christ! Why don’t I just print these goals up with a different year on each card? It’d save much time reflecting on life and stuff. And I could just blow it off by March or April, ok who am I kidding the 2nd week of February.

      So I finally went to see the a specialist for my hand. Yeah, that was a nice waste of a half day. The appointment went great till I had to wait 45 min. for the review of my x-rays. It amazes me sometimes. Anyway, hand hasn’t hurt the last 2 weeks just went to see the doc to be on the safe side (and because it was a 3 week wait to get in). He has no clue what caused it. Eh, what are ya gonna do?

      John Elway, Joe Monatna, Dan Marino MOVE OVER.   I've never seen a Quarterback dominate a game like Peyton Manning of the Colts Dominated the Kansas City Chiefs yesterday.   You heard it here first INDY is your SUperBowl Champ!!!  (ok so I'm sure you may have heard that several other places, but none the less having watched Manning since he was at Tenn. I did know his of his Greatness many years ago!)

       urlLink         Having the just gone through the finacial crunch of the holidays, the weekends have been . . . well . . . thrifty. So I find myself watching  urlLink Star Wars  after a very good dinner. Scott (my room mate) cooked a great dish called Swiss Steak, a wonderful combination of beef, covered in flower and tomato sauce, along , with a potato and a side of green peas. Ummm Ummm good. Sooo a Saturday night at home with Star Wars is the course for the evening.  It reminded me though of my college days when  urlLink Star Wars  was re-released into the Theaters. I remember a bunch of us got tickets to see it on a Saturday. Yep that's right we paid perfectly good money to see a movie we could have rented collectively at about 1/30th of the cost, but that's another post. I remember watching the movie and trying to think like those that saw it for the first time in 1979. How would a 21 year old in 1979 have seen this show? How would they have received it?  Now it is important to know that I grew up with Star Wars as one of my earliest memories. So I don't remember a time in which it did not exist. The world of the rebels fighting the federation, Luke, Darth Vader, and Princess Lea, were fond memories. We played Star Wars instead of Cowboys and Indians. So for me the world of star wars was like a history almost. I just accepted it.  I concluded that I have no idea how this film ever made it there were huge risks and crazy worlds. All of which the audience had no idea what was going on. However it did have one thing which I could not duplicate. That was technology. The Special effects were revolutionary at the time, and now watching them 15 years later I had seen the SPFX advance so much things looked a lot cheesier.  It was only until  I saw "The Matrix" (yeah I know the sequels were disappointing, but were focusing just on the first movie not the trilogies) in the theater sometime later that I realized what those viewers must have thought. A totally new world with revolutionary SPFX. When I walked out of the Matrix I wasn't sure what I thought, but I thought it was pretty cool.   Anyway no real moral to the story just a random thought.

      "Criticism has the power to do good when there is something that must be destroyed, dissolved or reduced, but [it is] capable only of harm when there is something to be built."  - Carl Jung   - Found this while reading a seminary book. Really made me think about how much of my time is spent in building and in how much is spent in destroying, dissolving and reducing.  Hummm. [note to self add that to new years resolutions (additional note to self start making new years resolutions)] Would love to write some great speech about all that but really that's about as far as the thoughts went. I do like the quote though.  - Additionally on the above quote does that mean that according to Carl Jung the term Constructive Criticism is an oximoron?

      It's a day of great joy!  I'm presently at home in a sweat shirt and flannel pj's.  Trying to make myself get some work done, but watching the snowfall is just too much. I think I'm giving up this battle after lunch. I'd post pictures but . . . um well  . . . can't so just go to  urlLink coqui's  site I'm sure she'll have some up of the area in the next few days.   At any rate nothing quite so beautiful as the falling snow. It's just beautiful.  Oh yeah, Doc says he has no idea what's up with my hand. Therefore, I have an appointment with a specialist in 3 weeks. Normally this would be no big deal, except that last night I was awakened by the sever pain shooting through my hand. I did discover that some Ibuprofern every 4 hours or so seems to do the trick. I'll be fine, just really wondering what's up with my hand.

      It's NOT carpal tunnel  . . .  Well at least in my very uninformed non-medical opinion. However I have a very sharp pain residing in my hand and sometimes both hands. From the base of my thumb to the first knuckle. I can't figure it out really. Sooo I'm leaving it to the professionals and letting my doctor look at it this afternoon!

      I spent my time this weekend in School of all places. And oddly enough I thought it was not only productive but actually enjoyable! It's odd to my that now that I can actually see the end of my schooling days (spring of '05) I find myself enjoying it more then I ever have in my life.   Before class we were required to read Now, Discover your Strengths, an interesting book that essentially says we should focus on our strengths instead of always trying to fix our imperfections. Andy Stanley talks about this same idea in Next Generation Leader (a must read by the way), but this book fleshes it out more and gives you tools to identify your strengths. The concept is good and something I’m going to try and work harder at implementing in my life.  Most of the class however was focused developing our personal calling statement. This is a three part process that combines your Biblical purpose Statement, your core Values and Your personal Vision Statement. I absolutely loved this process because it allowed me to really sort through where I’m headed. My position with the association ends in December so I have to decide what I’m going to do when I’m done. This class coupled with a conversation I had with my new boss last week have really brought a lot of clarity to my direction, but the details are still well . . . yet to be resolved.   The long and short of it is  I feel like God is calling me back to the local church, but has still given me heart to  help other Youth Ministers. Soo this is what I have so far.   My Personal Calling Statement  Biblical Purpose Statement I exist to bring God Glory; by being a man who places obedience to Christ and a love for others over my own desires.   Vision Statement I see a day when God’s call in my life will bring about . . .  . . . my passion for Christ overflowing into the lives of 6-8 people in discipling relationships; which produce passionate Christ following disciples. I see relationships with lost people, established through involvement in community sports, which produce new believers.   . . . a student ministry where adult and student leaders equip futures leaders to do the work of the ministry.   . . .  networks of Youth ministers across the Puget Sound, that work together to reach students and encourage one another.  . . . a seminary degree, that has given me a love of learning and a continued desire for growth.  . . . a wife whom I minister along side of and children which we raise to passionately seek after Christ.

      I'm a life long Cardinal fan. I started watching baseball when I was in 4th grade, I'd ride my bike to Chris McCloud's house and we'd often watch Ozzie, Terry Pendelton, Joe magrain, Todd Worell and the rest of the Cardinals. But they haven't been to the World Series since 87 and I barely remember any of that.   The single greatest trade in the history of my Cardinal fandom was the acquisition of Mark McGwire. He's still my favorite baseball player of all time. His run to 70 was one of the greatest season of all time! His rival Corky Sosa is a cheater. I don't like him and probably never will. Which brings me to my point.  There are 2 teams that I hate in baseball. They are really polar opposites of each other. One known for it's winning and the other for it's endless ability to grab defeat from the jaws of victory. Corky's team the Cubbies for whatever reason just irritate me. Call it the biterness, but if there is one team I want to finish ahead of every year it's the Cubs. The other team I hate is the Yankees. I think it's a law that if you care at all about baseball then you either love or hate the Yankees. There is no in-between.   Last summer I got to go to Yankee stadium to see my beloved Cards play the hated Yankees. And as much as I hate them I found myself cheering with them. In a wired way I loved what they had, the fans were so knowledgeable, they were so into the game it was awesome! Now, granted I will claim special circumstances, because I just happened to have tickets the night Clemens won #300 and K'd #4000. I came away respecting the Yankees and their fans, but still hating them just not as much.   All that was before this weekend. The signing of A-rod infuriates me. Because as I watch my team struggle to keep their emerging Babe Ruth (and Pujols is in that company by the way), while passing on a needed quality 3rd starter (Maddox). The Yankees add a guy they didn't even need! The Yankees payroll is more then double 4/5 of the league. It's just not fair! To add to the misery Arod is one of the "Good Guys", how can he play for the evil empire?? It's like your best friend just eloped with your ex-girlfriend. I mean I can't root for the Yankees!   So here's to hoping the Red Sox win the division and the Wild Card comes from the AL west!  Of course we always root for the Cardinals to win it all.  I'll post more thoughts on their division later, as this is way longer then intended.

              I’m in a theology class that I really enjoy this semester. I’m actually excited to read my text books. Anyway, we were in class on Monday talking about Christology and the 2 person nature of Christ (human and divine). The discussion involved a very confusing section on Christ being begotten but not created. It’s a long subject that I won’t go into right now, but it was fun and mind bending.          Next, we talked about the fact that Christ’s humanness remains still today. I never really thought about it till that moment. I always assumed that he just sorta turned back into fully God when he returned to heaven. But in order for our salvation to remain so must Christ’s humanity. I didn’t have a huge emotional reaction, but it certainly has changed the way I see my savior. It makes me feel closer to him.  Something to think about.

      This quote of the day brought to you by  urlLink Jayson Stark of ESPN   Eddie Layton, who is retiring as the Yankee Stadium organist after 37 seasons, was honored last week at the New Jersey Sportswriters dinner.   On hand to pay tribute was Yankees GM Brian Cashman -- who said he'd heard Layton had just gotten a call from Astros GM Gerry Hunsicker to see if he was interested in unretiring in Houston.

      SuperBowl observations  - The Pats O-line won the game for them. Yeah the defese was great, and Tom Brady blah blah blah, but 0 sacks for the entire post season was the clincher. O-line deserves the MVP.  - The first quater was the most boring football in the history of the superbowl. And there has been some really boring superbowls.  - Why do hire MTV to produce your halftime show and then expect it not to be obscene??? I realized how sad things were when a local morning show- known for it's pushing the line and sexual inuendo (yeah I know why was I listening to a show like that??) - made the point that the entire show was rather obscene and to get mad at the Janet/Justin incedent was crazy. I didn't see the half time (video games are better then crappy half time shows), but I do think CBS got what they bargined for.

      Day 3 !  Having moved my new years resolutions back a month. I have begun at least one them so far. I haven't had a soda since the Superbowl, and have stayed away from french Fries. Now some would call this a diet, but in fact it's really only an attempt to curb the insane rate at which I was comsuming very unhealthy food, and one of those let's see if I can do this kind of things. So far about 52 hours and counting!

      Today is a painful day. I sit and watch my razorbacks play basketball, well I use that term loosely. They scored 18 points in the first half against South Carolina. This is sooooo ugly. It was just a short 10 years ago that I was watching the boys win the national title. Ah, the glory days. Well they say they have some studs on the way. So Al Jefferson, Steven Hill, and company you better add a lot cause it’s ugly right now.

      Well here is my latest silly dilemma. Our Cable went out about 3 weeks ago. We never paid for it in the first place it was just on when we moved in. So when it went out 6 months later I was not surprised and my ethical dilemma (yeah I probably should have called the cable company and told them) was eased.   Well, Scott and I went out for an lunch Saturday. And the conversation came to what to do now. You see Speed vision is on and IRL racing season has just begun, so Scotty wants very much to watch the races. I have enjoyed not having TV to some degree. It's been much less distracting to not have much to watch. So my roomie says that he's all for it.  So here is my dilemma. 2 months ago I had a strong urge to buy an X-box. And pretty much made an impulse buy and got it. So now I'm at a crisis. I feel that I really don't need to spend the money on getting Direct TV (we decided that it's a better deal then Cable, especially since you can get the MLB extra innings. This would allow me to see 2-3 games a week of my beloved Cardinals!!!) w/TiVo. It will wind up costing me an extra 20-25 dollars a month. Which having just done my budget would be ok during the summer months, but with school in session it's pretty tight.  The only reason I would get Direct TV is to Watch Sports also I've heard of the greatness of Cable for years so that's 2 reasons. However, I'm just not sure the effects this will have on my spiritual Life. Any thoughts?

      School was canceled yesterday so we could attend the Evangelism Conference (yeah we Baptist are so creative with our names). Henry Blackaby was the Key note speaker along with John Franklin (a guy from Life way who did an excellent job as well). Blackaby spoke on 1 John 1:1-4   That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched--this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. 2 The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. 3 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We write this to make our joy complete.  1 John 1:1-4 (NIV)  He made a statement that resonated with the core of what I believe. “Eternal life has come to mean getting to go to Heaven when you die; but the Bible says that’s not Eternal life.” Eternal Life according to verse 2 is a relationship! So you and I can have eternal life today!   He went on to explain the reason so many of us don’t witness. Again, his message was  life a tuning fork in my ears, only it started to get painful. We can not bear witness to that which we have not, or in some cases are not, experiencing. In other words if we are experiencing a close intimate relationship your just going to tell others about it. If your not then your going to have to force yourself, or simply remain silent. Ouch!! That’s hard for me to hear, but it’s absolutely true. Which means I need to do some re-evaluating

      Meeting Mosaic  A week ago I had the chance to attend a meeting with Eric Bryant. Eric is on the leadership team at  urlLink Mosaic,  a church in L.A. Mosaic is the next Saddle back type church, not it's style but it's influence. The pastor of Mosaic, Erwin Mcmanus, has 3 books out.I finished the first one ( urlLink  An Unstoppable Force  ) a few weeks ago, and currently in the middle of the other 2 ( urlLink  seizing your divine Moment  , and  urlLink  Uprising  ). If you haven't read any of his books they are MUST reads.  Seriously some incredible books. McManus is not only a great theologian he's an incredibly creative person. After reading  urlLink  An Unstoppable Force   I had the same reaction as I did when I read Purpose Driven Church ten years ago, before it was the crammed down our throats. He's on the cutting edge, most notably  I love his thoughts on creating a culture through the church.  But that's not what grabbed my attention in this meeting. What grabbed my attention was something called "The Character Matrix". Mcmanus came up with this when he was working in an inner city church in Dallas, back in 1993. Essentially the matrix is a lose paradigm to help people see what their character looks like. The Goal is to transform self-centered people into servant leaders.  It's one of those things you have to see, and I have neither the time nor the ability to draw the picture clearly, but  urlLink  Uprising   is all about this concept so read more there. But I write to say that I was very much challenged in that meeting, and so if your looking for a book pick up  urlLink  Uprising   by Erwin Mcmanus.

      This day in Baseball Hisory:   1997 - The Chicago Cubs set the mark for worst start in NL history, extending their losing streak to 12 with a 4-0 loss to the Colorado Rockies. Chicago broke the modern NL record of 0-10 set by Atlanta in 1988 and the overall NL record of 0-11 by the 1884 Detroit Wolverines.  THe Glory days!!!   It's a sick addiction, but I love to see the Cubs lose!

      Season Preview  Opening day is tomorrow . . . night (yeah I know). But I thought I’d give my predictions on the standings as I think they’ll look come this October.  AL East   Red Sox – 2 words: Schilling, Martinez Yankees – Starting pitching will get hurt Blue Jays – Would be contenders in any other division in Baseball O’s – Good additions still not enough D-rays – Lou will have them playing better then the talent they have on the field.   AL Central – Division winner may only have 83 wins  Twins – I like Loshe and Santanna Royals – Good line-up but rotation questions abound White Sox- Not enough pitching Tigers – Still the tigers Indians – Still too young to do much   AL West  Angels – Added a lot to a team only a year removed from a Title Mariners – Great pitching, just no power and too old. They’ll fade come September A’s – Bullpen is shaky and the line-up isn’t as strong as it has been Rangers – WOW, a complete mess   NL East  Phillies – A solid rotation and a potent line-up Marlins – Pitching is too good not to compete  Braves – This is not your Fathers Braves team. To many questions with the line-up and the rotation. The rotation could be the 4th best in the division Mets – They aren’t as bad as their record last year, but I just couldn’t see the braves falling to 4th. Expos – How could they give Vasquez to the Yankees?? They really need to move this team in a hurry. I vote Portland, it’d be great to have an NL team with in a couple hour drive.   NL  West – Similar to the Al Central just not bad. Any of 5 teams could win it.  Padres – New Stadium and some nice additions will push them over the edge Diamondbacks – RJ and Webb will hold them in there Giants – Slowly fading into the background, age gets this team Dodgers – Pitching is still there, but like the M’s they have no power. Depodesta will make them a contender, but not this year. Rockies – After Helton and Wilson I can’t think of a player on their roster, so they get last place.  NL Central  Cardinals – Yeah a bit of a homer pick, but I look at what they did last year and see that they’ve made significant up grades to their bullpen. They have 2 top notch pitchers (Williams was second in the NL in wins last year) along with 2 other work horse pitchers that will keep them in games. Combine that with the Best Defense in the NL and the Lineup the cards throw out and I just can’t pick against them.  Astros – Their pitching is un real, but Clemens (41) and Pettite both had era’s around 4 last year. Now they move to a park that is not Pitcher friendly. In the Last 3 years Pettite’s record away from Yankee Stadium is not that impressive: 21-14 with a 4.20 ERA and a .289 Average Against in 268 innings but a  3/1   k/bb ratio  Also they have an aging lineup with Kent/Biggio/Bagwell, they could but up big Numbers, but they could also age really fast. All that said they have 2 awesome starters in Miller and Oswalt. They could very easily run away with the division, it’s going to depended on the veterans if the postion players hit like they have in the past they could win it.   Cubs – Their pitching is great it’s the lineup and defense that are a bit shakey. Also I’m not convinced they have a solid pen. Last year the key to beating them was getting to the pen. The addition of Hawkins helps, and if Farnsworth puts it together then this could be a strong suit, but as I’ve said before. It’s the Cubs they find a way to lose!  Ok all three of the teams below are in a word AWFUL. The Reds have a good lineup if everyone’s healthy, but I dare you to name 2 starters in their rotation. And the Brewers and Pirates are both pathetic teams in nice stadiums.   Reds Pirates Brewers   AL Playoffs Red Sox over the Twins  Angels over theYankees   Sox over the Angels  NL playoffs Cardinals beat the Padres Philles beat the Astros  Card over the Philles   Sox over the Cards in 6 ( I hope I’m wrong)  I just can’t see anyone beating Schilling and Martinez in the playoffs.   NL MVP – Pujols (finally) AL MVP – Delgado  NL Cy Young - Beckett AL Cy Young - Pedro    A couple of additional thoughts.   I don’t care what they say Opening day should ALWAYS be played in the U.S.! Not Japan, Italy Korea Australia, Russia, or China and no not even in Canada. Nothing against those countries but it’s AMERICA’S past time. One of the coolest things about baseball is the tradition that comes with it. When I visited Yankee stadium last summer it was more then just seeing a game it was seeing “The House that Ruth Built” the place where some of the greatest of all time played ball. You could almost see mantle and DiMaggio in the OF or Yogi behing home plate. Same with Fenway. Please for crying outloud Selig don’t screw up Opening day any more.   •	As sorry a commissioner as Bud Selig has been you have to give him credit for the Wild Card. It keep more teams competitive deeper into the season, which makes for some phenomenal races.  •	That said how is it that the Marlins have more World Championships (2) then Division titles (0)?   •	I don’t care what the Cubs did in the offseason, they are still the Cubs and will find a way to lose before it’s all said and done.  •	Also, why is it that nobody gives the cardinals any credit? They had a horrible season last year and had some key injuries especially early. They blew a League high 20 something save chances last year, and only finished 3 games out. So all they did this year was revamp the bullpen and bring in a more stable rotation to go behind Morris and Williams. Suppan and Marquis aren’t flashy but they can win with the lineup the cards will but on the field. Trust me the Cards will be there come September.  •	How can the Cubs and Cardinals play their last series in July?? The 2 teams don't meet again the rest of the season. I don’t care if they are the 2 worst teams in MLB their rivalry is one of the best in the game and they should always have a series in Sept.   •	Finally, Barry Bonds is a cheater. Ok well I can’t prove it but it sure looks like it. At the least he’s my favorite player to root against. (Yes, I’m still bitter over the 73 season. Give me Big Mac anyday)    That’s my take. I’ll update it at the break.

      Wow! Ya know they always say that in baseball players get old overnight. Well it's official the Mariners are OLD! I went to my first M's game of the year last night and they just don't have it. With the fickleness of the Seattle Market I'll be interested to see what the team draws next year (it'll take a year for them to really see the impact).   I'm grateful that I'm only a casual M's fan. Cause otherwise this would be a truly painful year to watch.

      I’m in this class that over the last 2 semesters has been extremely time consuming. In the class you are required to make a covenant and goals and all this stuff to help you work on some of your weaknesses. Along with that you meet with a Field Supervisor (my boss) weekly, a Spiritual Director (a pastor friend of mine) Monthly, and a ministry support and reflection group (made up of people I work with) 6 times over 8 months. It’s a lot of paper work, but the intent is great and it has given me a lot of feedback on how people perceive me.   Today was the “competency interview” or basically what I thought was going to be a “hey here is all the things that you need to continue to work on” meeting. Instead what it turned out to be one of the most encouraging 45 minutes I’ve ever experienced. The meeting had my boss, 2 co-workers who’s opinions I highly value and respect, my peer group leader ( a convention leader that I’ve enjoyed getting to know through the process), and a guy from the seminary.     I won’t go into all the specific of what they said (cause that would feel really self absorbed), but they spoke words of encouragement about the things they saw in my life all most all of them positive and a few that pointed to areas of needed growth. But all four were tremendously encouraging and spoke from a genuine heart. Their words were very comforting and something I feel God ordained for me to hear today. Not to stroke my ego, but to remind me of the call he has on my life, words that are needed as I look for my next place in ministry. I officially have just over 6 months left in my current position and have begun to think about what my next move might be. It’s exciting and frightening all at the same time, but today I feel blessed and encouraged. Blessed to have friends that will speak truth in my life, encouraged by the fact God’s call on my life is noticed by those around me.

      Last week I had the privilege of attending a disciple now weekend at former  urlLink youth minister's present church . It was a great weekend, where I had the privilege of hanging out with 8 of the coolest 7th and 8th graders you could ever meet. After the weekend was over I we took a trip to New York and Philly on separate days. It's amazing how close all those places are.  The last evening Emily (a new friend that lives in Delaware), Jason (a good friend from Ark and Seattle) and I went to Beautiful Citizen's Bank Park.     It was great to be able to see the new ballpark, but it was even better as it was my first game of the year. AND as if that were not enough they boys in Red were there to boot! SO I was pretty much giddy from the time we hit the parking lot. To add to my excitement I had the privilege of negotiating the price of our tickets with local merchants.   We got there in the middle of the first, which I was ok with because that meant we'd definitely get below face value. After passing on some REALLY good seats that were a bit out of my price range. I was thought to be a sucker by vender #2 (tried to pass off $22 roof top bleacher seats as between 1st and home), we wound up going with vender #3 getting front row seats in the second deck just inside the foul pole.  The stadium is a great place to watch a game and of course state of the art. Being in philly I of course had the obligatory Cheese Steak (my 3rd of the weekend) which I must say was delicious. The game was great going down to a 6-5 victory for the cardinals with Izzy striking out Pat Burell with the bases loaded to end the game.  The evening was a blast in large part due to the company, proving once again that the best things in life are those that your able to share with someone else! Speaking of which I have to grab a movie on the way home, as some friends are coming over. So I'll try and be a bit more frequent in my posting. I also have some things to process as my world slowly begins the transition process yet again!

      Dear Buck,  Thank you for your resume submission we appreciate your interest in our employment opportunity here at Church X.  Your qualifications are excellent.  However, we regret that the position is closed.  We will keep your resume on file and wish you well in your employment search.    Sincerely,  (Church X H.R. Guy)      That's the reply I received 3 weeks after I sent my resume to church X. And the sad thing is that's the only response I've heard, from anyone.   This process is going to be very frustrating. And I'm already tired of hearing verses like Phil. 4:16 (be anxious for nothing . . .), however upon receiving this letter I felt a peace (. . .and the peace of God will guard your hearts and minds.) about the process that I hadn't to this point. It was kind of like ok settle down, stay faithful in the position that your currently at and let this process run it's course. Ok so maybe I need to hear more verses like phil. 4:16.

      Rarely does the world of sports intersect with Coqui's interests, but this I thought was a rare time so I'll comment on Soccer just this once.   David Beckham chocked like a school girl yesterday. Missing his penalty shot by a good 15 feet over the goal. What was he trying to do exactly?

He has allowed a major league-high 23 homers in 15 starts and wasn't overly perturbed about being a footnote to history. 'I stayed away with breaking balls until on a 2-2 count I tried to slip a fastball by him,' Morris said. 'I guess people have been doing that 500 times, and it didn't work.' "

      A few random thoughts . . .  - The Pistons won. And it wasn't even as close as the 13 point lead.   - I watched every game from start to finish starting with Game 2. The first time I've watched an NBA game since the Jordan era.  - It was a blast to see a team without a superstar. While the lakers did have more talent. The Pistons were definatly the best TEAM.  - Larry Brown is a class act and I'm glad to see him win. Acknowledging Rick Carlisle in your moment of glory? Are you kidding me? Wow.   - Speaking of Carlisle he's got to be the most bitter man in all of america. I mean honestly first your fired and then beated by the team that fired you, and they do the impossible. OUCH!!!  - THE Piston's Announcer is THE BOMB!!! Honestly he was the coolest! Especially after the Lakers stiff.   - Finally, did you see the horrid lip sync job by Aretha Franklin? It was so bad the camera's couldn't even pull out and make it work. It was sad.   Now that it's all done Baseball will be center stage till Septermber!!!

      This is a facinating list. A couple of notable tid bits as I looked at the list. The "A's" are actually in the middle of the pack in spending. Usually they are one of the bottom 5. The Rangers are actually  below the A's now.   The mets take the cake for the bigest waste of moneyin the NL, thanks in large part to the 17 Million owed Mo Vaughn. While the Mariners are the biggest spending losers in the AL.

       "I have faith.  It only becomes cultish when people start to think that their way is the only way.  I feel bad for Hilary Faye her whole identity is her relationship with Jesus. (Mandy Moore, Teen Vogue, May 2004, p. 118.)"  This is the core belief of the "pop culture Jesus". I'm not saying we should all protest the movie or anything insane, it just saddens me that any person who professes to "have faith" would ever think that the goal of thier life should be anything less. I know she's responding to the hypocrisy displayed by her character, but it reveals a much larger heart issue.

      Well folks it's that time. Seems like every 2 1/2 years I change jobs. It's not that I'm not happy or anything like that, but the last few jobs have been of the more temporary nature. And so it is with my current position. So I am officially looking for a new Job, I've got about 6 months before I HAVE to be in a new place, but I'm looking to move around the first of September. We'll see what God has in store though. Oh yeah, You can click on the Title to see a copy of my lovely resume.

      Let me go on Record as saying that the Cincinnatti Reds are all smoke and mirrors. I'm not sure how they are winning like they are, but it simply will not last. The team is in the bottom half of the league in Runs Scored, Runs Against, and fielding %, you don't win championships doing that. Also they just don't have the pitching to last that long. My guess is they'll fade shortly after the All-star break if not before.  Also please note that as I predicted Chris Carpenter is have a break out year, and now that Albert has come back to form the Cards are starting to put it together. Now all they have to do is survie the loss of Mike Matheny (his defense and ability to call a game will be missed).

          &nbsp;  "The law don't mean to take revenge, only to get justice." - Buck Webb&nbsp; (as played by Ron Hagerthy)   &nbsp;   "The Sheriff of Smoke Tree" September 20, 1956&nbsp; Episode # 184 A new mining camp needs a sheriff to control a man named Lem Crater (John Beradino) who arrived recently with two other men. A young man, Buck Webb (Ron Hagerthy), wants the job but after being run out of town, he needs some persuasion by the Lone Ranger to go back and borrows one of the Ranger's guns. A fight and a smoky mine shaft all add up to young Buck proving that he has what it takes to be the sheriff. The Lone Ranger is convinced also when he hears Buck say: "The law don't mean to take revenge, only to get justice." Mickey Simpson plays the part of Slim Peake, Slim Pickens plays the part of Joe Boley and Tudor Owen plays the part of Mason.   &nbsp;  I'd love to see this episode.

      Ok so what's the pitching equivalent of staring at a home run? Pumping your fist after a K? Wagging your finger at a guy? Plunking a guy for the second time that night because you just lost the game?   Well I'm not sure exactly but Carlos Zammbrano, while a great pitcher, threw the biggest tantrum I've ever seen. Sheesh kid grow up.  P.S. The Cardinals have officially clinched the NL Central with their stunning comeback win today.

      Funny stuff. . .  &nbsp;  Stacy - Silverton, OR  Comments: Before a softball game, one team member prayed, ''please let the other team win...and let us win, too.'' Both teams win? Like a tie, perhaps? Except nobody wants to tie...somebody's gotta win. It was hard to not laugh out loud when I heard this prayer.   THO's Response: Stacy, it's good that you didn't laugh out loud; you did what is right. A big part of being a Christian is knowing when to laugh and when to laugh behind someone's back. The good thing is even though the latter takes patience and willpower, those times are usually way funnier so you can have an even bigger laugh at someone else's expense an expense that they don't even know exists. The 'cost' of laughing out loud in front of them is often paid by you, and sometimes comes in the form of the pastor stopping his sermon, claiming he's doing the best he can, crying, and later kicking you off the worship band, which was made up of a bunch of no-talent clowns and had a horrible keytarist, anyway!

       urlLink Myles Werntz   a friend of mine from college, and a fantastic writer, had a very thought provoking blog today. Read his thoughts and you'll know what I mean, but one line is a good jumping off point   "This is the curse of our generation: we are forever Cain, wandering from town to town, never settled down, leaving our name and feelings in little places all over the map."  I've been thinking a lot about this subject lately. Having not lived in the same residence for longer the 16 months since I left high school (I'm almost 28), and having lived in 4 vastly different areas in that same time. Looking for a job, again! (making this my 3rd job since leaving college) I find myself on the other end of the conversation.   I long for a community where my departure is not predetermined. I long for a place to throw down roots.  But I know that, that place will not be here. I must once again pull up roots and start all over. While the location could be as close as 15 miles or as far as 2,500, the result is the same, another new beginning.  This time it's different though, for there is a hope. A hope that this could bring the peace that I seek, the peace that comes with longevity. They say one key to effective ministry is being in one place for a long time. I want to say that my ministry was effective, the lives were changed, and that I my time on each counted.  And I want to say that my ministry was hard to distinguish from my day to day living, and at the end of it all God was pleased with the life that I lived.   But does that require that i remain in one place? I have no idea. The thought of living in one place for 30 years, is both comforting and suffocating at the same time.   IN the end though I have to rest on the fact that I do believe that God will see me through to the end, and that if I seek after him he'll place me where he needs me. A trite saying, but true none the less.

      If you read the book Moneyball (which any true baseball fan should have by now)run differential is sort of the mesuring stat that many in the indutry use to judge how well a team should do. The following explains why the cardinals are as good as they are. They may not have a GREAT rotation, but it is a good rotation. Couple that with the best everyday lineup in the NL, and best defense in Baseball and you have a team that should win the NL central.   I do wonder though how well will the cardinals do in the playoffs? If Morris and Williams come back to form by the send of september then I think they have a shot, but really the playoffs is a crap shoot. Just ask the braves.     urlLink STLtoday - Sports - Columnists : " run differential is a leading indicators of a team's strength and success. Through Wednesday, the Cardinals were a plus 95 for the season; Boston is a distant second, at plus 65. The next-best National League totals belong to the Cubs (+59) and Braves (+32).

      I now know what it’s like to watch a film that is filled with blatant lies to advance a political agenda. I just got back from Fahrenheit 9/11. I left angry, in fact I left before the movie was over. If I wasn’t a minister I would have flipped off the screen on my way out. If the movie were true (which it’s not), then George W. should be hanged on Pennsylvania Ave.  I’m not saying that Bush has never lied or that he is a saint. But this movie is clearly an attack on Bush (conveniently only a few months before the elections) seeking to harm Bush’s reputation.   If you’ve seen the movie do yourself a favor and scan over a rebuttal to the movie. The link in the title is a pretty good one.

         This makes 2 Saturdays in a row that I've had the joy of climbing everyone's favorite volcano. Last Saturday Heather and I went up the Paradise side. Well that is to say we did about 4 miles of hiking on 2 trails. There was a ton of snow and some nice views. The hikes were moderate with some elevation but nothing horribly difficult.  Today, However I went with Brian, DJ and Steve. WoW!!! We did approximately 10 miles (maybe more) in about 5 hours. This may not be a lot for the experienced hiker (which I'm not), but for me it required a hot shower a 2 hour nap and an evening with my feet up. It was Brutal. I loved the hike up the mountain, but coming down my feet were killing me with about 3 miles left.   Normally, if I'm tired I'm going to take a breather and easily mosy down the mountain. However today DJ and Brian had to be at work by 5. So after coming up short of making Mystic Lake (we only had about a half mile to go too!) We decided that we had to turn back or make the fellas late. So after 3 hours of hiking up the mountain we needed to be back in 2. Fortunately we were headed down hill for most of the way.  We made it, and I'm glad I got pushed like I did it was a great workout, but I'm definitely feeling it this evening.  Anyway, I'm a officially a big hiking fan and intend to make more visits in the future.

      I'm in Memphis. It's the morning after Brad's wedding (my roommate in college), I'm sitting in the club section at Autozone park ( a very nice AAA baseball park) about 50 min. till first pitch. I've had a great weekend.  The Bachelor party was a blast 7 guys playing quarter poker till 3:30 in the morning. The guys were a lot of fun, we had barbeque at the rehersal dinner, which was preceeded by a lunch ar Rendevous (the best rib joint in memphis). And no there is no such thing as too much BBQ. It's fun to come back home and see old friends. But that wasn't why I was here.  Serving as the best man I had the privialdge to stand by one of my best friends and his bride to be as they made the most significant commitment a person can make to another person. I felt very priviladged. Blessed to have a friend that valued me enough to say I want you right here at one of the most significant moments in my life.  Theentire weekend I wanted badly to just serve them. To do whatever I could to make this day special for Brad and Hannah. Anyway, they are in Mexico now probably checking into thier hotel. I know they'll have a great marraige. And I pray that I get to stay in close contact with them.
