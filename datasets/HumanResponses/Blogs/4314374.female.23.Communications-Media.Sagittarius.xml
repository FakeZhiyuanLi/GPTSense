      I am in no way a kiss-and-tell kind of person. But this is just an online journal and nobody here knows who I am. There could be a million "Sublime" nicks out there, and I am sure nobody would identify me as sublime. I'm much more of a laid back kind of lad. And anyway, I'm not really gonna relate everything here--I'll leave out names and places and stuff.  Ok, lemme start with describing how a perfect kiss would go for me. Not that I'm complaining--I love kissing, really. Especially if it's done with someone you really like--as in like wherein you get freaking butterflies flying around inside your stomach and flapping their wings so hard it makes you want to puke. Or of course, kissing is really good when it's done with somebody you find so hot for so long...and it's just that, when those lips come into contact with yours, nothing else but this kiss can be described as ecstasy. Pure ecstasy.  Well, this kiss that I just experienced is no way totally different than the others, although well, fine, it's slightly different because well, I don't know how it's different. It just is. Or maybe because it's somehow scripted, like I'm the one who freaking provoked it. It's like practicing first...finding that kiss wet and uncomfy at first, but when you get the hang of it, you'll realize that it's not so bad, and it keeps getting better and better.  Do you know the lyrics to the song "This Kiss"? Well, a stanza there or maybe just a few lines remind me of that kiss...it's like that pivotal moment-like you think that it's one of those things that can make your life important and that that kiss will play a major role in your life.  Or well, it's totally criminal, but yet subliminal. Told yah I'm with somebody else, but it didnt really make me feel guilty because like my name implies, it's subliminal!  (& I'm sure he's done loads of kissing himself--with others!) Well, that doesn't justify it, I know. But you know the feeling of smoking a good dope and then the effect was so good that you think you'll stay high forever. I guess that feels like it.  Anyway, I dunno if I'm making much sense, describing a kiss without really giving any detail of what really hapened, but these are just thoughts alright, and you wont really know if this is true, or just a dream...but oh wow! What a breathtaking dream!

         Friends keep telling me that they always hear the same lines from me, such as "this time, it's different", and "he's not the same as the other guys I dated" but eventually, that date will turn out to be something you just wanna forget, or something not really worthwile to think about and mention to my friends. This keeps happening to me.  Well, I sort of found someone who I think is good for me. Older, more mature, more responsible than I am, and a thousand miles far from me. How could that survive? For the first two months, I'm really, really into him--chatting, email, text messaging, even wasting my precious prepaid load to see how he is. But now, I'm just...I dunno, tired or I ran out of things to say to him. And as March 2005 gets nearer, I'm beginning to dread it. What would I tell him? Are we gonna pick up where we left off? That's a bit uncomfy. I gotta admit, when we were together, it's always fun...and I can't seem to be able to stop touching him or caress him and stuff. I just cannot take my hands off him. Now I dunno what I even saw in him. He's just well...not for me. But we'll see, won't we?  And there's this other one who's just a flick away. I dunno, but I didn't see anything in this guy before. I wouldn't know if sparks were flying. He's more of my friend than my crush. And maybe I'm in love, but I wouldn't know if I really am. I mean, i've only been in love once, and I forgot that feeling already. Sure, I get excited on other stuff or other guys, but well, I wouldnt know anymore. For one thing, he reminds me of my first boyfriend, but he's much, much more different. Everything about him--even his flaws...looks appealing to me. His flaws do not bother me! And I miss him sometimes. And now I dream about him often, but not that kind of dream like I had with my number one crush now--I dont even know if I still like number one because he pulled my hair back when I pulled his. The nerve! anyways, going back, would you believe that when I think of him, I just cannot imagine his face anymore! That's a sign when I am totally into somebody. And I get nervous. I really do, but only recently.  I just realized how much I took this liking for granted. I thought I was only fooling around, but Im beginning to think that this can hurt me--big time, and I have to stop before I fall hard, without anybody to catch me or guide me. I can't. I simply can't.  So I guess this is love--but I have to get out of this one fast.  Guy down under---better hurry and come back!
