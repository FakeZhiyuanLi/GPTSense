      i was on my way to meet up with some of my friends and a yellow lamborguini (how ever its spelled) pulled up next to me on the tollroad well needless to say i had to race it. so i down shift to third and take off, he had no idea, but when he saw me he down shifted and took off, i had no chance. we raced about 8 times and each time he kicked my ass, but it was still fun. i missed a few days because school got out on wednesday and this is my first night home since. each night has been a party hard. it has been so kick ass, but the best was last night. i went to  my friends ranch and a bunch of my friends and i just had so much to drink, it was soooo fun. on wednesday night i spent the night at my friends house and we went to white rock lake cemetary and right as we pull up i tell chris to turn on the brites and a huge dust storm blows by, it was so fuckin scary. there was also a light coming out of the grave-yard. i was waiting for a guy with a chain-saw to come out and kill us all. it has been a great summer adn it has only been three days. this is exactly what i needed. im tired so ill write more later.  there......im done

      so all of my friends have read this and here are some comments  my thoughts...u need a new outlook on this great(and by great i mean fucked up and shitty all at the same time) place we're at in life  no offense to you or anything but u view life in a shitty way and as much as u thnik that ur life sucks there is always someone out there whos life sucks more so if anything u should be an optimist and thank god u have it easy...everything in life is hard...but it gives u no reason to wine about it..it gives u a reason to make it better...and if u cant amke things better from wat they are..then maybe life is a waste to u..this is just me thou   but this is really what hit me:  the minute u ever feel betrayed by life....i want u to picture the one legged hobo under the central expressway bridge who balances on one leg all fucking day begging for money so he can possibly eat something   this is true i do have it pretty good things could be better but still i have it very good im going to try to turn things around i have to open my eyes and try to see what is really out there what is really waiting for me, i have to harden my heart, and at the same time open it, it will be a challenge but i have to try  there.....im done  (thank you will)

      here is a chapter 6 of the  the four loves  writen by c.s. lewis:  to love is to be vulnerable  to love at all is to be vunerable. love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. if you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. wrap it carefully round with hobbies adn little luxurie, avoid all entanglements, lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. but in that casket-safe, dark, motionless, airless-it will change. it will not be broken, it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. the alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. the only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell. i believe that the most lawless and inordinate loves are less contrary to God's will than a self-invited and self-protective lovelessness. it is like hiding the talent in a napkin adn for much the same reason. "i knew thee that thou wert a hard man." christ did not teach and suffer that we might become, even in the nature of loves, more careful of our own happiness. if a man is not uncalculating towards the earthly beloveds whom he has seen, he is none the more likely to be so towards god whom he has not. we shall draw nearer to god, not by trying to avoid the sufferings inherent in all loves, but by accepting them and offering them to him; throwing away all defensive armour. if our hearts need to be broken, and if he chooses this as teh way in which they should break, so be it.-  now as all of u kno i am not a religious person, but when i read this it really hit a nerve, it made me realise that i put my heart on the line and that to get hurt was enevitable, i just wish it didnt hurt so much, the only thing that this genous didnt say is that if you truely love something, you will always love it, ALWAYS, a dog that i had when i was in kindergarten (this may sound dumb) but i still love what i remember, i dont think that will ever go away untill the memory is lost, and memories are always there, even if you cant pull it up, your memory never goes away, just your ability to pull it up  another note: hey baby girl, i love you, listen when i say it, stop laughing  yet another: i wish you could only see how i feel on the inside  the postal service sums it all up in there song nothing better (dl it its amazing):  Will someone please call a surgeon Who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart That your're deserting for better company? I can't accept that it's over...  I will block the door like a goalie tending the net In the third quarter of a tied-game rivalry  there.....im done

      well here it is. the down fall of all humanity as we know it. studying. i normaly dont mind it but i hate everything right now so its a huge pain in the ass. im growing really tired of having to deal with goin over shit i didnt learn in the frist place. heh well whatever. as i was reading a book for english that i hadnt read in the first place i started to fall asleep and in that half-awake and half-asleep state i started to think about the weirdest things. it started out with my family: me and them never really get along but last night all we did was fight about nothing at all, just got in an arguement and i started to ask myself, in my half-sleep state, why did we argue so much? what was it about and why did it start? no answer. i woke up and started to read again but started to fall asleep again and asked myself what did i do wrong to lose it? why does it hurt so bad? why does it still make me cry and when will it be over? again no answer. i stopped readin that book to prevent any other questions from coming to my thoughts and desided to write in here for a while......its not helping as much as i thought it would.  there.....im done

      this is my first entry into my "blog"  when i was creating it was askin me a bunch of questions and i had no idea what they were asking. ANYWAYS. i have my exams next week and i am sooo fucked. i wish i had studied more paid more attention in class. i am just so tired of school and all the bullshit that surrounds it. everyday i have to ask myself if its worth getting up, if its worth goin to school. some one asked me last night at 230 where i wanted to go to college, i said i didnt. but what am i ganna do with my life? where am i really heading? is my destination nowhere? haha, it might be. if only you could see into my head you would really understand where im coming from. but you cant, so you wont even try. all i ever wanted to do was show the world who i can be, but it didnt work out. not a new thing for me, things dont work out to much for me without a fight, but im tired of fighting, im just goin to give in and take it for as long as i can, then we will see what happens.  there.....im done
