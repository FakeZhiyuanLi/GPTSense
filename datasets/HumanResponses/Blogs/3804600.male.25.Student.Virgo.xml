      Hi there.  It looks like I've joined the blogging community, which by now consists of everybody and his mother.  Let me briefly introduce myself.  I'm a second-year grad student at UCSD in economics working on my PhD.  On the side I would like to get faster on my bike and I'm a bit of a gourmet coffee and wine snob.  Life is too short to drink Maxwell House and Miller Lite.  I'm one of the few Republicans in the department but I'm an equal-opportunity curmudgeon.  It looks like I'll be doing some research in macro in the near future but there's no major hurry yet.  At this point I hope to kick back and enjoy the ride.

      I was referring in the previous post about my reservations with Bush.  From what I can gather among other Republicans that I know, these are pretty common.  When an incumbent Republican president can't get these votes he's in trouble.  As things are right now I'll still vote for him as the lesser of two evils.  Here are the problems that I have with him:  My problems don't really revolve around Iraq.  Saddam had chemical weapons and was deceitful about it, with probability 1.  He broke the cease-fire agreement of 1991 and harbored terrorists like Abu Nidal.  And he was just a bloody thug.  Based on the costs and benefits of intervening nobody can really argue that invading Iraq reduced human welfare.  The PR, especially after the prison scandal, has been atrocious, and the administration doesn't deal with crisis very well.  This is what has turned my friends off.  Bush is a terrible spokesman.  Grade:  B+ on the substance, D on the style.   My take on Kerry:  Is vague and aloof really a better PR strategy than tongue-tied and aloof?  I do fear that he'd hang our allies out to dry if something goes wrong.  He's done it before, at least twice.  The more reluctant that he is to intervene somewhere else in the future, the more that our enemies believe that they can get away with.    Also judging from his conduct in the 1980s where he supported the Communists in Nicaragua, he has horribly bad intuition regarding good and bad uses of American power.  And what if the Iraqis try to put Saddam to death?  Would Kerry send in the lawyers?  Likely grade:  C.   My problems don't center around social conservatism.  The president has made nobody happy in his bioethics decisions, but making everybody happy is impossible.  Apart from that the administration hasn't governed in a noticeably conservative way.  Grade:  B+.   My take on Kerry:  Makes Ted Kennedy look like a moderate.  Not likely to make good court appointments or respect personal freedom unless abortion or sex is involved.  Likely grade:  D.   Environmental policy is much the same as Clinton's.  I had been hoping for more innovation here like the 1990 Clean Air Act with incentive-based schemes.  More muddled thinking on environmental policy.  Nothing really new.  Status quo.  Grade:  B-.   My take on Kerry:  He might blunder into doing something innovative.  Then again he might micromanage things like auto emissions standards or alternative fuels without a real understanding of what he's doing.  So far, he's proposing the latter.  Likely grade:  C.   Trade policy has again been a muddle.  While Bush has been pushing for wide-reaching hemispheric trade agreements and making nice with Brazil, he's imposed all sorts of steel tariffs and wrongheaded agricultural policy.  Again there seems to be a lack of serious thinking about incentives.  Grade:  C+.   My take on Kerry:  Voted against NAFTA.  Edwards is his running mate.  Shows no understanding of corporate taxation.  Likely grade:  D-.   No Child Left Behind:  Dead in the water.  Federalizing education without addressing incentives very much--why schools act the way that they do.  Just gives schools more reasons to fatten administrators' pockets at the expense of teachers, parents, and students.  Grade:  D-.   My take on Kerry:  Voted for NCLB.  Opposes school choice.  Strong centralizing impulse.  Likely grade:  F.   Fiscal policy:  Tax cuts, at the expense of making the code even more complicated.  Maybe marginal improvements in incentives for capital formation (reduced cap-gains and inheritance rates).  Timing was a little bit late for much of a Keynesian stimulus.  Also done in conjunction with huge permanent spending increases, so this is more of a tax shift.  I hate stochastic tax rates.  The administration just doesn't understand accounting.  It has a better team now than a few years ago but this isn't saying much.  Grade:  C.   My take on Kerry:  Mixed.  Does have some reasonable advisors left over from the late Clinton administration.  However there's the traditional Democratic tendency to complicate the hell out of things and Kerry's wish to increase spending on health care even more than Bush has.  A divided government might help but my opinion of Congress is not much better right now.  Likely grade:  Either B+ or D.  Depends on whether the Clintonites or populists are in charge and if government is divided.   Civil liberties:  Mention the name "John Ashcroft" and watch some people foam at the mouth.  This was even before he became attorney general; some people are plainly bigoted against the guy.  The fact is, the Constitution is still in effect; Habeas Corpus is still here; the cops or Feds still need a warrant to search you; and it's still a huge federal procedure to be declared an enemy combatant in a time of war.  Mistakes and bad decisions do get made but it isn't clear to me that things are any worse than the 1990s under Janet Reno.  Let's face it; she had a tendency toward clumsy violence and a clear disregard for people.  And nobody can forget her role in the fake child-abuse cases of the 1980s.  The point that I'm making is that we have to judge officeholders against real alternatives, not against some mythical ideal.  By this standard, the current attitude toward civil liberties is OK but can always use some improvement.  Grade:  B.   My take on Kerry:  Not much difference on substance, only style.  Likely grade:  B.  Likely to be better in some areas, worse in others.   Immigration reform:  Neither candidate has done much to give me encouragement on this issue.  I come down in favor of high levels of legal immigration, done in a decent humane way.  By this standard, I'd give a grade of C-.  Could be worse, could be a lot better.   My take on Kerry:  Supports unconditional amnesty for illegals.  He doesn't care much for legal immigration though.  Likely grade:  F.   Security:  Improvements have been made, but do we really need to pretend that old ladies are as much of a security threat as young guys travelling on a one-way ticket paid with cash?  Get real.  Grade:  B-.   My take on Kerry:  I would expect him to put political correctness above effectiveness when it comes to things like airport screening.  At the same time if there's an expensive way to increase security I'm sure he'll support it.  Who the heck knows?  Likely grade:  C+ with a huge standard error.   This is why I still plan on voting for Bush--Kerry offers no affirmative reasons for me to vote for him and plenty of reasons not to.  He's running as the un-Bush but in all the wrong directions.  The antidote to a big-government Republican is not a bigger-government Democrat.  I would have supported a primary challenger to Bush.  Not necessarily McCain, who is off his rocker.  Lieberman, maaaaaaaaaaaaaybe.  This is one election where I wish we had a true "none of the above" option.

      Kerry's finally picked his VP choice.  No big surprise.  Based on what I've seen from the Iowa Electronic Markets and on Tradesports.com, this has given Kerry a 3% probability bump.  My take on the whole thing:  Advantages for Kerry:  Edwards isn't frightening in the way that Gephardt could be.  For one thing, Edwards has eyebrows and has been known to smile.  Also Edwards has a reputation for being less liberal than Kerry.  This also plays well to the protectionist sentiment currently afoot and might help Kerry in the Midwest and parts of the south.  This particularly might have helped him in places like Michigan and helps to keep Ohio in play.  Disadvantages for Kerry:  This makes people like me no more likely to vote for him.  I have plenty of issues with the Bush presidency but this doesn't address any of them.  In terms of economic policy Edwards has exactly the wrong intuitions--litigate, regulate, and micromanage.  Great ways to make health care unaffordable for instance.  I don't buy the Republican claims that he's unintelligent; after all he is a successful lawyer.  But he isn't all that open to new ideas.  In fact, he sort of reminds me of the current chief executive.  Edwards basically reminds me of a character out of a John Grisham novel.  This isn't good.  Kerry just took a bigger risk than many people are making it out to be.  I'm imagining what GWB would have been like as someone's VP candidate.  The guy just isn't quick in front of cameras.  This is fine, but I'm expecting an "Edwards is stupid" meme to start up at any time now.  Unless only Republicans can be called stupid.

       urlLink The original can be found here.   A few minor points:   "Thereâ€™s a trade-off, in the short run, between unemployment and inflation. If you go back far enough, you can find plenty of Keynesian economists asserting that this trade-off also occurs in the long run."   -And a reasonably good case can be made for a negative tradeoff in the long run, if real money balances and consumption are complementary.  I happen to think that this is likely.   "Inflation turns ordinary working people into millionaires."   -Quadrillionaires if we're talking about lire.  Imagine how Republican the Turks must be!   "Democrats are opposed to inflation. Indeed."   -Only when Republicans are in power.  LBJ and Carter didn't seem to mind.   "Inflation hurts the poor...."   -How so?  I would think that an unanticipated bout of inflation reduces the real value of debt,  redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor.   "Inflation is anti-Communist. For several years now, one of the biggest buyers of US government bonds has been the Chinese central bank. No doubt, they think theyâ€™re buying leverage, but all theyâ€™re really going to get is pictures of Ronald Reagan. Heh."   -Sounds like fun.  Maybe throw in some pictures of Nixon.   "Inflation will destroy trust in government money and encourage the creation of private-sector alternatives."   -Give those gold-standard cranks something to do, I guess.   "Inflation is part of the American patriotic tradition...."   -And of the Russian, French, German, and Hungarian patriotic traditions too.  What better way would there be to reach out to our friends in Europe?  Sounds like a John Kerry campaign promise to me.

      OK, so I had an afternoon to kill recently and saw "Dodgeball."  The movie's pretty cheesy but  urlLink Lance Armstrong makes a cameo appearance.   I could think of  urlLink a few movies that I wouldn't rather see .  I don't know about you, but Michael Moore reminds me of the uncle that I'm constantly trying to avoid at family gatherings.  The uncle whose idea of formalwear is freshly pressed Zubaz.

      We got our qualifying exam results back last week.  For those of you who don't know, UCSD econ PhD students have to pass at least two (sometimes three) qualifying exams in the core fields of macro, micro, and econometrics.  I took the macro and micro and passed them both.  The pass rate was just over half on both exams.  Therein lies my problem with this whole arrangement.  These exams test students' quickness in regurgitating a bunch of math learned during the first year.  But who really needs to log-linearize an ugly monetary business-cycle model apart from those of us going on to do macro?  Who really needs to derive the integrability problem on the spot?  Integrability is abstruse enough that our only exposure to it was when one of the professors had a grand mal seizure and bit one of the students.  True story.  These exams test the ability to take a test.  That's it.  They don't delve deeply into the skills needed to do research.  At the end of the first year I feel like I'm no more prepared to do research than when I started.  There's no guidance as to how to select something interesting as a topic.  Nothing about how to model effectively.  Nothing about the history of our profession apart from a few anecdotes.  There was one professor who'd use as a catchphrase, "We're all good mathematicians, so..." after which I'd audibly gag.  I'm not a good mathematician.  I'm an economist who can take a derivative and do some simple matrix algebra.  In reality this amounts to little more than hazing.  "I had to sit through Arrow-Debreu so you will too."  Wouldn't paddling and excessive drinking be much more efficient?  Surely less painful.
