      so i've realized that it is actually much harder to remember that i have this thing than i thought it would be. so now lets see if i can remember what i did in my life recently. here goes. WEDNESDAY:   sat around most of the day. i started to watch braveheart at night (excellent movie i might add) but then liz came over with her new puppy so we walked it back to her house and hung out there for a while until i went home. then i finished braveheart. then i slept. oh yeah and i also found out that IM GOING TO FRANCE. i got into the excharge trip. im so excited. i really didnt think id go bc 10 my teacher was not my biggest fan. we did not get along. shed be super duper mean to me so id do stuff to piss her off, and then still get Bs on most everything so she couldnt complain. and  2) ill only be a sophmore next year and they usually dont take that many sophmores and theyre taking at least four that i know of (me, amy, liz, and this girl allison i dont really know that well but my mom said i used to take ice skating with her). i really hope i get a boy. that would be wickedly awesome. THURSDAY:   now im pretty sure i didnt do much that day. except in the afternoon. then i went to the nursing home to play with the old people. it was fun. theyre really nice. i played scrabble with these two ladies. it was cool. old people are super-duper fun and theyre really neat to talk to. after that i went to dinner and then i took a jazz class with my sister. ive never taken jazz before but the teacher told me that since ive done ballet since i was 3 i could probably start in the second highest level if i decided to take it next year. i think im going to. but if i do that means i will be taking 5 classes a week. i got into the highest levels of ballet (3, 3/4, and 4) plus ill be doing 4 on pointe, and the highest level in modern. picking up a jazz class would be really hard, but also a lot of fun. i dont really know what ill do. hmmmm... something else to think about. oh well. ya know as i think back i really did a lot on thursday. hehe FRIDAY:   now i did a lot on friday. SIX FLAGS!!! i went with amy and liz. it was so much fun. we went on all the good rides twice and even waited for the front row on bull, batman, and superman even tho superman isnt that great of a ride. also there was this really fun spinning ride that we went on in the afternoon and then came back to at nite. at nite we rode it once, and then got off, grabbed our stuff, ran around the ride, got on and had to re put our stuff in the bin to ride again. after that time the really hot guy who was running it let us go again even tho it was 9:15 and the park closed at 9. if anyone ever comes to great america they have to go on it. its called the revolution and is right across from the american eagle. liz also talked me into going on the rapid ride. BIG MISTAKE!!! i was wearing these beige cargo capris and they got soaked and turned see through!!!! i had to walk around with my sweatshirt around my waist so no one could see my underwear. it was a pain. i lived tho. it was a fun day. i love theme parks. so much fun. SATURDAY:   i slept late. then got up. watched spiderman but then i had to get dressed because i was taking a ballet class. took it. then i had to go help pack up at my moms craft show. boring. then my family went over to amys house because they invited us to dinner. it was fun. they have a trampoline so we got to jump. and then we watched the real world marathon (last episode tues!!) im strangely addicted to that show. i love it. hehe. not much else happened. a slow day. TODAY:    i had to drop my sister off at camp today. itll be interesting to see how this goes. she gets horribly homesick. uh oh. i hope she does okay tho. i feel kinda bad for her councilors. i went with her to a camp last year, and she cried every night. it was horrible. and of course she wants to go away again. shes crazy. i have to remember to write her. i tend to forget things like that. hey for now im and only child. YAY!!!! ha  well thats life for now. rock on.

      so yeah. i didn't do much today. i did finish my profile tho (check it out). i hd to spend my afternoon cleaning my room. what a horrible waste of time, but my mother decided that just leaving all my clean clothes on the floor was not putting them away. so in the end she won and i had to hang up two weeks of clothes. i seems to get into predicaments like these a lot. why i don't just hang things up when they come into my room i do not know. hmmm thoughts to ponder. o well. after that i had a ballet lesson. my first private lesson with this certain teacher. shes super duper nice, just extremely tough. and now she wants to extend them to an hour and a half. o well. better than being stuck at home. so i got home, watched The Breakfast Club (great movie) and now here i am. oh well, life sucks but hey i'll live. rock on.

      ok so ive randomly decided to do this. thought it might be an interesting ummm expiriment. why not try. maybe ill actually remember to update once in a while (don't expect much tho). so my life... pretty messed up now actually. last week i told the guy i liked that i liked him. needless to say, he wasnt interested. me being the idiot i am tho, wanted to find out why so i got my friend debbie to ask him online (he didnt know her). she pretended to be somebody from another school, but he looked in the yearbook (why he had it is a mystery) and since she wasnt there, he got mad that shed lied. she told the truth and said shed just wanted to find out what was up with us. he said that he thought i was a cool friend, not more. well then he got pissed and figured out that i knew what she was doing. i apologized but hes really mad at me and just said whatever.i know i messed up and if we never talk again itll be ok, but i cant stand it if hes mad at me forever. so all in all its been a depressing weekend. maybe this week will be better. i hope so. rock on.
