      This is typed from another 10-minute break. We still have 2 more rounds to go... Man, I'm getting tired. Some of the original players had went to play xBox instead. So, the 2 of them are replaced by another 2 cousins from far far away. They are sort of having holiday back in California, so they just flew here, since they hadn't done so for nearly 10 years. The first thing I found weird about them is that, while the local people are finding it sort of a freezing night, they insist that we should on the air-con. Brr, we are sure in a freezer now, and they still complaint that it's warm! (it's 24 C)   What is most surprising is, they have fluent Chinese and many Chinese cultures!!! What a shame to Singaporeans! They are living in an "ang moh" country, and their Chinese can still be so good! Sigh, better whip out my Chinese now, it's sort of getting low-standard...

      I'm playing mahjong now with my cousins. We are taking a 10-minnute break now, giving me time to update this blog. I've have won most of the rounds!!! Although we didn't really gamble real money today, I'm still very happy. Anyway, we are going to play 12 rounds since we started at 6pm. We have just finished our 7th round, so a few more to go. Mahjong is one of my favourite games, since I always win.  It has stopped raining today, what a disappoinment!!! It's starting to get real hot. Haix... I had hoped that this rain will go on. Okay, this break is nearly over, better get going. Got to finish 5 rounds by 12 midnight.  Oh! I nearly forgot to talk about PE today. The PE teachers wanted us to run 3km, 80 push-ups and 40 sit-ups! It's killing us!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Okay, this is my first blog and supposedly my first diary, unless you want to count the dream diary my teacher told me to keep. She said it can be good for literature purpose, and she got the idea from the Harry Potter book (supposed to be a divination class).   Anyway, it's dear old ks who told me to blog. He actually BEGGED me (no offence meant). I don't understand how he can be that desparate to read some other people's life! (Maybe he want to see how i die in school everyday.) As usual, lessons are boring today, especially maths (the prime, rational, complex, numbers are driving me nuts). And again, there is a lot of homework. Some pupils told the teacher that they are Muslims and celebrating Hari Raya and the teacher actually believed it! (Mind you, mine's a Chinese school!)  Also, nothing special actually happened today, unless you want to count a classmate being late for lessons and the teacher locked him outside the classroom. Another thing which is worrying me, the chosing of EP3s! I'm still pondering over what to do.   Today, we discussed about the IP programme too. I gave in my opinion that parents are given more competition as they are usually "hao lian" when their kids are in the IP. That's more stress for the pupils. The most scary thing today is still the Chinese test! It's so difficult! I'm sure to fail...

      There's nothing much to write this time, just one word to cap it all, "busy"! Business (bu-si-ness) has crept all over, with a hetic lifestyle all the time. Teachers won't care about you at all, all they have to say is just 2 words, "Do Project!". I haven't scored much for ACE in Mathematics, only a pathetic 1 point out of 20 for the whole year, I HAVE TO WORK ON THAT!  In my school, we have scored exceptionally well for O' Level again. We managed to push the MSG (not the seasoning for food) to 1.09 for Mathematics, that was incredible!   According the ks, SP2 for Windows XP ("Do what you cannot do in the past, now with Windows XP.") is coming out soon. It has a new build-in security centre, checking about firewalls etc. Even if you go to the  urlLink Mircrosoft  website, there will be the three ways to protect ur PC, so there actually isn't a need for it.  Today's reports (in fact the last few days) have come to an end once again. Everything that has a beginning, has an end... (Copyright "The Matrix" movie, Warner Bros. Company)

      Sigh... I'm still doing my project work now. Feeling bored? Of course, but I have no choice. Really, blogging has sort of become one of my hobbies.  When I look back at my old posts, I actually wondered how I had typed all those in a short time without writing a draft. I just login, and start typing all the words out. This blog is also typed with no preparation at all.  Once again, I must say that time is flying real fast. It looks like just a day ago when we celebrated New Year's Day,  but let me remind you, it's already the END of FEBRUARY already, and we will be into MARCH soon. Term 1 has already passed (primary schools starting to have exams already) and it will be the March Holidays soon (although only a week, but...).  Today, my computer teacher wants us to do an online digital portfolio. We have to do some profiles etc., and put all our project works and assignments into it. Sigh, I must really get into using Dreamweaver and CSS. Take a look at KS's blog, it's cleverly designed using tables and of cause CSS. (I think I will copy something from there! But he keeps putting the copyright thingy, so i have to ask permission first.)  My History test and Geography test results has came out, while others are preparing to take the test. I have managed to scrape A1s in both subjects (heng ah). Tomorrow shall the the results for the Literature test, now now, I'm not looking forward to it...   I'm writing a journal now (for teacher of course). It's a good thing that I blogged, so I can just "copy and paste". My next blog update???

      KS has a new look in his blog, spare me for this lousyish design of my blog, but there's really no time to redesign. Okay, i admit it, i don't know how to, because the templates are already provided, i'm wondering how can we edit it, because i don't see the button "Design your own blog!!!". HTML coding the new blog is really too tedious...  I know, i have not updated this blog for nearly a week. But there was simply no time. Look at what time this blog is posted. Although i'm still online on MSN, but I'm actually doing powerpoint presentations etc. for ACE (activities for curriculum extras, i'm just joking, don't believe it) points, because term progress report coming soon, if i don't get the credit points, i'm not surprised if i get C6 (wah lao, C6!!!). I can say that my Maths is a complete failure, there isn't much u can do on!  Sec 1 camp is coming soon, and i can't say i'm enthusaistic about it, because camping is not my cup of tea. My real cup of tea is travelling (yes my american cousins, British spelling for "travelling" is different from American spelling). I also don't know why I love travelling so much, especially on planes. People are scared of long-term flights (long-term means 10-16 hrs, not 6-8 hrs), but I don't find them tedious. Yes it can be pretty boring (my family's a cheapskate (in fact we claim air tickets using points, becuase my Dad travel for business a lot) and always ride on planes without personal TVs and other luxurious comfort, so i actually never sit before Singapore Airlines, which is a great way to fly). Back to the topic again, sec 1 camp i think it's all a bluff... I will comment on what it's like when i come back from it 2 weeks later, i promise a longer blog.  School updates have come to an end now, so there's nothing else much to talk about actually as I always stay at home and powerpoint here and point there. Goodbye ;)

      *Ok, Jensen, my total project count is 6. How many do you have?*  Mine can be called either a lot or a little, ks, depeding on the "doer" of the project. We are supposed to write a 2000-word Major Research Paper, I have a partner, and have 8 months complete that, so I don't worry about that too much. Then we have Project's Day, doing a major project on any topic you want as long as it's under the appropriate categories. I have another 3 members in the team, but in this the deadline is within 3 months, so actually I'm quite worried about it.  Now for the "minor" projects. I have done 2 Geography projects, 2 History projects, a Maths project, and 2 Chinese projects to be completed. Oh wait a minute, I still have a Geography project to be completed by next Monday!  And... *computer studies! I can't believe it. They are learning more and more complicated things, and soon, they would be learning the crazy language called Javascript.  I won't be surprised if alot of people don't understand Javascript. It's very odd language. Maybe Jensen and their school would find it easy, as there are "professional" trainers to aid them. Currently, they are learning Dreamweaver. And their version? MX 2004. The latest and the greatest.  To be frank, I don't find great difference between the Dreamweaver versions of MX and MX 2004. Can anyone tell me the difference?(  Now now, ks, don't you get jealous. You are born a com expert, so you just have to glanced through books from the library and you will be Professional already. But we have to learn the hard way, because we have no base knowledge. And pls ks, CHS ain't that rich as you think. We won't have the money to hire professionals! Javascript we do know all those simple simple type one, so you actaully don't need to get jealous at all!

      ks, so good! You all still running 1.6km, we are running 2.4km already!!!!!!!! Our last common test is on Friday, Literature. Computer studies today was toughy, with all those questions only ks the computer-maniac can answer. History was difficult too, because of the inferring question. Secondnary school life is tough, especially in CHS.  Same as ks, the blogs in future will be completely different, what i mean is shorter. Projects are now bombing us everyday, and the bombers? The teachers of cause... Now I don't believe in the crap that the Integrated Programme is supposed to be fun and joyful... IP means more stress because of projects!

      What do you mean, ks, that I'm not as bad as you think??? Now now, I'm not really "alien" to computers, or I wouldn't be sitting here typing this blog now. (We are really starting to get into an arguement.)  Anyway, I will sit for my Geography test tml, so naturally I'm studying now. Life in CHS isn't really that bad, there's very few homework, but many research work and projects and reports to do. And yes, CHS is really one of the leading schools in Singapore but that doens't mean there ain't any lousy students here, and I'm a really good example.   Soon, March holidays willl be coming, only 4 more weeks to go! Again, I must say time fly past very fast, before we know it, it will be 2005. See, we are finishing Term 1 already. And very soon I will go back to my primary school to visit my dear old teachers. Poor old Mrs Lee teaching P6 again, so she has to work hard to produce star students.   PS. I must say Mrs Lee was very fierce to us last year, but now now, we do understand that. Now in CHS, we can score if we speak up in class! I must remember to tell her that.

      *** Then I changed it to computers. Dear Jensen has changed it to entertainment. And he spelled 'favourite' wrongly. And he's from one of the best schools in Singapore. Believe it or not.  Ok, i'm not killing you. I'm really surprised that you can still update your blog sorta regularly. Good for you. What are MQs anyway? Erm, what I said just now DOES not MEAN that I don't want to stop you from blogging. Keep the posts coming! ***  ks starting to personal attack me! Look at what he said in the last post. Anyway, so what if I'm from one of the top schools? There are lousy students in a top school, and i'm one of them. I 've not been performing well in tests (MQs, stands for Multiple Questions) at all. The most I every got was A2, and ks got many A1s.  By the way, I have changed the template of this blog. The reason is really simple, I like this template better (boo to those who can't guess it).   PS. I actually never heard of the movie MouseTrap or whatever. I just thought of entertainment because ks wrote "a world without coms is chaos!" (fully copyrighted by ks, and for ks, I'm just stating an example, don't prosecute me). But it's quite true, a world without entertainment is even more chaotic!

      It's Saturday today again, time flew by indeed fast. And it's Valentine's Day once again, but I rather recognise it as Friendship Day. This shall be a relatively short blog. Notice that I usually update the blog every alternate days, because MQs after MQs are coming. This week we have MQs nearly every day. (ks, pls dn't kill me.)  I've been talking about ks for quite a few times (in fact many). He's a friend who is also a old classmate. He can't live without computers, and the docs still can't diagnose his conditions (haha, not meant to be a offence). His favourtie tagline? "A world without computers is chaos!" I didn't much agree on that, they are no computers during my parents' generation, but I'm still here typing this blog. But I really do agree that we are getting more and more dependant of computers. (Are computers smarter than humans???)  Presidential Election is coming soon. I am unfortunate enough not to spot the Senators giving pep-talks. But my mind is set, it shall be the one from Aphelion. I'm looking forward to free movie previews, ice-cream etc. A world without entertainment is chaos... (Copyrighted by [Me!!!] 2004)

      Didn't update the blog again yesterday. I will sure get a scolding from ks soon... When? I don't know. But I will know that I soon will be in hell! He can be very fierce! I notice that many blogs have music now. I can hate that sometimes (if i say hate it very much, i will get double scolding!), because the songs I listening will become pop-corns popping!   I had test after test yesterday. First 2 hrs to write two Chinese essays, followed by 40-min break, then English essay, then 10-min break, then Maths test. I can't tell the details of the tests here, if i'm found out, I will be cruxified! School privacy statement and copyright order... But i can say that I will fail steadily in Chinese essay!  Tomorrow will be celebration of Memorial Day (in loving memory of しょなんーと, or Light of the South, which was once Singapore, you know what i mean）. We are supposed to watch the movie "The Pianist", don't know what's it do with any of the 5 defences. I was hand-picked today (so honoured) by my English teacher to be part of the panellist tomorrow for a terrorist debate. How unlucky can i get!!!

      Tomorrow we shall have Chinese, English and Maths test. We are informed last minute once again! Chinese and English are testing compostiotion, so don't need to revise also can, just remember the format. I then tried to take out my Maths textbook, but found that we transfer notes online instead. But there ISN'T  a thing about the laws of Mathematics!!! OMG, how am I going to study without understanding them???   This is another problem with having no textbooks! We can't refer to the, when we don't understand some of the things!!!

      Just recieved a geog ws from the school's online system. I wonder (this should be in a cold manner), what on earth is good about the school online system when teachers are allowed to set homework lsat minute and to be handed up by tml?!?!?! Maybe I will write to the Senators to tell them this problem. The school online system should meant only for lesson notes and assignments (actually I would prefer school without big assignments at all) in advance. Improve on that, Students' Union!!! Anyway, the union should do what the name tells them to. They should ask teachers to give less worksheets and strive for no tests. ("What on earth is a school without worksheets???" famous quote from parents) But the stress is really kicking us down. Will parents rather have more tests so that they can "hao lian", or rather have children committing suicide?  This is the problem of parents. They want their children to STUDY, STUDY, STUDY. And then children will study until they DIE, DIE, DIE!!! I must still stress that school should be a fun place for us all to learn new things in a fun way, not worksheets and worksheets and more worksheets!

      Today is another boring day. The Assembly was full of those election stuff (i'm absolutely not interested in politics, even school politics). There will be multiple questions (MQ, or more well known as tests) coming soon, i hate tests!!! Why can't schoo be more interesting and do away with those examintations, tests and spellings etc. I hope school will be a fun place for us to learn, where we learn stuff in a fun way such as games etc. I will certainly enforce this if i'm the Minister For Education, but again i'm absolutely not interested in politics.   Today's Assembly focussed on the Senators of the coming election from four different parties, mainly Aphelion, ProEd, Ortus and iSpark. They gave us rallies today and i have a good mind who to choose already. Many of my classmates agree too, and I really hope he will win, because we will sure have a lot of advantages! This particular Senator has lead his opponents by such a big margin, but i assure you he ain't John Kerry or whatever.  Met Norvin today. He insists that there isn't an ez-link card inspector now, and he said that there isn't a ticket for you when you pay the bus fare by cash. When I retorted him on that, he said that he has won me in PSLE by a large margin. And he insist that it's Hua Zhong Di Zi and not Hua Zhong Zi Di. He also told me that he finally got an email account, I cogratulated him on that. What a blur one he is now...

      sry for not updating the blog, but i was really busy, busy, busy. Busy as a bee! I took out some of my PRECIOUS time because i got a painful scolding from ks. (wah wah wah!!!) As usual, the PE teacher yesterday made us ran 2 miles, did push-ups and sit-ups (so many that in fact i lost count). Homework was quite okay this week, not as many as last week, thankfully i did most of them in school, so practically there was no homework.  You may now ask me, what was I so busy with if I have no homework? The answer is not playing (boo to people who think that!), but finding something for my research. It' stupid really, the system in my school, damn confusing. Also, i'm revising for my Maths test, it's gonna be tough i suppose, after doing the mock test. (what is the distributive law? what is the associative law? what is the commutative law?) Maths is really much much toughy compared to dear old primary school days i'm missing. You will really lose out during the test if you don't use calculators, a delightful machine invented by some godly person. Gone were the days when people do simple maths for trading... Comprehension was also toughy in sec school. You must write a summary etc etc. Sigh, how i wish i will be Peter Pan and never grow up... There's another reason behind not growing up too, i dun have to worry that people will call be an old bastard who won't die when i'm old.

      Well, it's of course another boring day at school, unless you count a student late for every lesson for the whole week, all the teachers were so frustrated with him that he was kicked out of class during lesson. Got a scolding from my English teacher (AS A WHOLE CLASS). Finally found the Adrian Mole book, it was damn disgusting, read it and you will find out what i mean.  Today's also the last day of Chinese New Year, we ate some fantastic dinner at home. ks told me he got abalone today!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, I noticed that he started liking to use "man" in his blog. Visit it at  urlLink http://kschua.blogspot.com .  My American cousins going back tomorrow. They will be taking Singapore Airlines SQ20, which means they will be one of the first ones to take the first non-stop flight to Los Angeles. AND, I would like to mention something prior to their stay. They actually said that my spelling is horrible!!! My American friends, there are do people, in fact much more, who uses the British spelling instead of the American spelling, this often sparks up some confusion, as MS Word also uses American spelling, it can sometimes be so sickening. Another thing, they saw this date, 05/02/04, and they actually thought it was 2nd of May!!! (Americans put their month in front of the day.)

      The sickening bird flu is spreading like mad. A new rule was introduced at my house starting from today, no brining of parts fo chicken into the house, whether be it drumstick, chicken wing or chicken faeces.   Again as usual, school is damn boring today. We got a talk on project work... And my Chinese test results had came out, I mangaged to scrape an A2, not bad... The problem is that we have to do 20 corrections for each incorrect question!  Homework? We are supposed to find some sort of boring words...

I felt really surprised, we are in SECONDNARY school, and my amount of homework daily has reached an alarming rate, yet they are still so free! Well, how I envy them...   Hey, to those who are so bored out there, I think you better check your planner carefully! If there's really nothing to do, may I introduce a truly fantastic website,  urlLink http://www.sleepinginairports.com . It's certainly a site to kill time, and you will wish you have more time instead.

      It's another boring day at school, even with Literature and Computer Studies today. These are supposed to be my few favourite subjects. Literature was boring enough, with the completion of a worksheet on " Lamb to the Slaughter ". Computer was okay, except for the extremely difficult task of forms and CGI scripts! (bet ks will love this)  The homework is also as usual... Sigh, how I hope the December holidays will come soon, and we can say we are moving quite fast. It's already February, and Chinese New Year going to be over... Why can't we have summer holidays in Singapore? (since it's summer the whole year, we can don't go to school!!!)  Another thing. We are talking about that  sickening  bird flu on it, and we are supposed to write 1 foot about that! I'm still pondering over what to do... What to do, what to do? I think i can relax myself with a bit of comedies, especially like Mr Bean, but i dun have the disc... Maybe I can laugh a bit with Home Alone too, but the problem is time!!!

After that, I have to write a proposal on my research (you may be thinking i'm in a university, but i'm not)! Luckily it's Hari Raya tomorrow, so i still have time to complete.   It's really sickening! They are going to Sentosa today, but because of the alarming amount of homework I have, they won't let me go!!!!!!!!! God knows what will happen next... Better complete my homework soon, or they won't let me go to the zoo tomorrow too!

      Nah, didn't update this blog for quite a while eh? Well, busy busy busy... Even in the holidays, I got myself engaged in so many projects! I'm currently pressurized by a MAJOR Chinese Website Designing Project. It's a National competiotion, so you can expect the standards. Computer Studies is getting quite sucky too, i think except for ks. Now we are learning Flash, and I'm supposed to draw a car entirely using Flash and animate it...  Besides these project (many many more), I have another thing that is stressing me out because of concern and anxiety. Now now, ks, tests in Chinese High doesn't start the test on WEEK 5, but on NEXT TUESDAY. Plus, we already got a full load of common and class tests on all subjects last term, so of course it will be quite sometime before another round of studying and tests starts. Chinese class test is on Week 5, I suppose...  Progress Report is out already. I never thought I was going to make it through Mum, but surprisingly, she wasn't too upset by my atrocious results. I got 2 A1s, 2 A2s, 1 B3 and disappointing enough 1 B4. How I hope Singapore would use the American 10-point grading system...  Now comments on the holiday...  I really love this quote, "Everything that has a beginning, has an end." Last was the beginning of the holidays, we have already reached the end. Luckily I still had time to enjoy myself a bit. Besides doing projects, I was able to spend some time to play Final Fantasy VIII. Yes, I admit it, I'm quite a "fan" of Final Fantasy, but I still like 8 the most.   I broke my record and completed the whole thing in 43 hrs, without even losing to any of the monsters, lose to any bosses, or fail my mission etc. etc. I also broke the record by deafeating Ultimicia (plus her GF and her final form) in just 18 minutes, but this may be luck, as I got the all the 3 characters I want in my initial fighting team. I also broke record of deafeating Rajin in just two moves (using Aura magic and Squall's Limit Break). The 19 soceresses at the end of the game proved to be tougher this time, as their HP all increased to an average of 10, 000, I don't know why this happened too, on avearge it should be abput 4, 000.  I managed to attain all possible GFs, without even using cheat codes.   Okay enough with the final fantasy thing. Now is the end of this entry again...

      ***The new website should be coming just after 7 days (which means, after holidays). The new URL is : http://kahswee.netfirms.com . Ok? Please do update your bookmarks and Favourites list. Thanks a million!   Hint #2: Fade In Fade Out.... Ah, so smoothing.. and what's this? Oh, I can click this?  Hopefully it gives you alot of idea and inspiration on how the site looks like. Jensen, please do shut your mouth up. Thanks!  Ok... T-Boz is off to camp. Jensen just came back from camp? Me? Camp? Sure! At home, with homework as food. Supposedly, the paper tastes bitter and sour. Bleh! Homework I'm doing it of course, and I should have finished my homework by Monday, and I will have to study all my subjects soon after. The 2nd class tests are coming, people! It's held during Week 2 of Term 2. Main Subjects to focus on: Science, Science and Science. Geography and History too. Oh yeah, speaking of History, our actual History teacher is here and her name is Mrs Raja... she's said to be on materity leave, who knows? She's quite fierce and when she said "I don't want History to be a boring subject... I want the whole class to participate..." the whole class was quiet. Normally, 2 periods of History on Friday would mean Chaos. Now? Even an ant marching could be heard(literally). And she drones and drones and drones off. How can History not be boring?  AH, I'm feeling restless. Here's Hint #3:  The 10 laws of life.   Ok... enough talking.  It's raining plitter platter for the past few days and some areas of Singapore got flooded. Poor thing. Luckily we would not have any floods as our house is on high land... so if our house is flooded, the rest of Singapore would be, too.   We are lucky for the time-being.  Please do note the words "time-being".***   Right now, I am going to give a lot more hints. Yes, in fact i have already a sneak preview of his website. Now I'm going to reveal it.  1) It's great. 2) Nearly flawless. 3) ks a lot of "mo shui", a lot of da dao li one 4) ks as dashing and handsome as ever  Now, if ks house is flooded, mine may not be flooded. **Hint 1: Yes, I do live quite near ks, but mine is even more high-rise than his house (he lives in a, well...). Our area is supposed to be the highest in Singapore already. If even good ole B*k*t T*m*h (sry, but no revealing of place) is flooded, is quite true that other parts of Singapore must as well be flooded.  This update is mainly for ks, so... Everything that has a beginning, MUST has an end. But this shall not be the end, this shall be the beginning of everything...

      Okay, here's a full (so full that maybe you want to stop reading half-way) update of the camp. Alright, I admit it, I was too tired yesterday after coming home from the camp, to update this blog. Maybe I will just use a word to describe it, sucks.  1st Day (Monday, March 8, 2004)  This is probably the worst day of the whole 3-day camp. The idiotic rain kept on pouring and pouring, without stopping at all. Luckily we got a big tentage (the one used for last year's Mooncake Festival at Chinese Garden), so we all had out activities inside. But what on earth is camping when you stay the whole day in the tentage, without even going out of it enjoying some fresh air? Even at night, we can't set up our tents at the campsite as planned earlier. We had to sleep on grounsheets, and it was freezing that night. When we had our song session that evening, the rain got so bad, that our very own principal had to teach us to do the "anti-rain" dance. In the end, we can't even have a bath, after participating in all the activities and feeling sweaty and sticky. What a nite...  2nd Day (Tuesday, March 9, 2004)  It finally stop raining this day. We were so happy that our anti-rain dance worked. There are more lookouts for activities today, but we missed our dragon-boating, awww... But there was still water activities, which were quite fun. First, we have to cross a muddy and dirty canal, walking just across a rope. I unfortunately was one of those who fell in, and when I came up, my white school shoes becomes a black sports shoes. Next was building a raft out of some pipes and some floats. Of course we got wet, we were sitting on the floats.  Showers were horrible. There were 4 big buckets in the area where the wash-basins were. We were supposed to stripd naked in front of everyone, scoop up water from the bucket and take a so-called bath   At night was the campfire, all classes must put up a peformance. I think my class' peformance sucks a lot. The 3 judges (made up by student leaders) were American Idol style, with Randy, Paula and of course the "infamous" Simon Cowell. "Simon's" remarks were so damn painful, "You dare to call that a performance? Somehow I feel more entertained looking at the trees.". The campfire ended at around 12 am, we were so tired that we fell asleep. We were allowed to pitcht tents this night, but it was still an awful squeeze.  3rd and last day (Wednesday, March 10, 2004)  Today there's the bidding game. Each class was given $300 (faKE OnE), and we were supposed to bid for some REAL foodstuff and things like that. My class was stupid enough to bid $150 for some plastic cups, some broken spoons and some rubber bands. It was classified under mystery items, so we didn't know that it was that.  We were finally allowed to go home, the first thing I did once I got home was soak myself in the bathtub and took a luxurious bath.  The camp altogether finally ended, so called everything that has a beginning has an end. But this will not be the end of the good and awful memories of this camp.

      It's a week to a one-week holiday soon. I'm actually not excited at all. One week? What can you do with only one week? More tuitions? One week... Can't they extend this let's say 2 weeks? One week shall be spent in doing all the homework and few periods for playing...  I'm sad to announce that holidays in other countries is often much much more than Singapore. In Western countries, they have 3 months summer holidays (ends after Labor Day, but it depends in which state) and 1 month Christmas holidays. That is not the end. There's still nearly 1 month of Easter holidays, if I'm not wrong. Plus, there are many public holidays in these countries, unlike Singapore, although it's multi-racial.  Camp is on Monday, drawing closer and closer. We will be camping at Chinese Garden, Jurong East. I don't know why they chose a tourist attraction spot for camping. And it's near the lake, means a lot of mosquitoes. I'm really really NOT looking forward to it. I rather spend a couple of hundereds to go overseas for traveling and stay in a hotel. Camping, in my opinion, is absolutely not fun. Traveling is the real fun thing, wish I could take part in The Amazing Race...  This is just another report in my life. Life is just an illusion, nothing is actually real. Even the chair you are sitting on right now isn't real. There's no such thing as the real world. Everything that has a beginning has an end. The start of this virtual world shall come to an end one day, which day? No ones knows. End of this virtual world shall be the beginning of the real world.

      If you have read KS's blog, well.. He got 4 A1s and 1 C6 (ty). Hey, ks!!! You have one of the best results! Want to know my results? All the grades are so different that I'm too lazy to total them up. Here are the results (boo hoo):  English - B3 Higher Chinese - A2 Maths - A2 Science (Combined) - B4 (!!! Neary last in class) History - A1 (yeh! but i think it's by luck) Geography - A1 (yeh again! but again I think it's by luck) Litearature - B3 Computer Studies - A1 (CURRENTLY) Music - Don't know yet but I stronly suspect a D.   As you can see, there are 3 A1s, 2 A2s, 2 B3s and even 1 B4! So ks, I'm sure you feel even more satisfied with your results now eh? You even reached 80 for some subjects! Gone were the days in Primary School where we can score 90+ all the time. :'(  Hehe, so ks, you all have Home Economics eh? Make sure next time you cook something for me, I'm really enthusiastic to taste your "Pizza Bread"! (I'm not being sacarstic.)  Holidays is really coming soon, even ks is going to install Sims Online. However, one thing to worry before the holidays, the progress report! What is my Mum going say? She already scolded me for my poor results when the test papers came back! Will she agree to sign the report? I also got some zeros in some of my assignments (quite a common sight in my class, especially for Oral Participation), especially Maths (for me)!  Here is the end of my update once again. Everything that has a beginning, has an end. But this will not be the end, there will be some more updates in future. (too lazy to put copyright, but you still can't copy, unless permission is obtained, for ks, you are at liberty)

      Ha, we have half-day at school today because of the good O' Level results! I went back to primary school again to see Mrs Lee, and the first thing we heard her is scolding "Sickening!" to the 6C this year. Mrs Lee told us (me and someone anonymous) that the 6C this year is more tamed (not as wild as us last year, at least), but very dumb (dumb means cannot talk, not stupid)! According to her students, "dumb" has became one of her favourite words, besides "sickening". (haha!) I really hoped to hear the 6C students this year complaining about Mrs Lee's bragging of 6C last year!  As school was only half-day, so naturally there wasn't any homework. However, I did get back my Science test paper back today. i ended up with a pathetic B4. I was really distracted and tired on that test day, so this was expected long long ago already. Not surprisingly, I forgot to put the units for my mathematical workings and put the wrong instrument for the "match this measurement with a instrument" questions. Instead of putting a burette, I put a beaker. I actually wanted to put a burette, but without knowing it now then I realized that I have put a beaker! Another question was instead of thistle funnel, I put a pipette! Something must be wrong with my eyes that day, that picture was so clear that it was definitely a thistle funnel!  Sec 1 Camp will be next week, I really dread this day that is coming, SOON... I don't know why but I just hate camping. The "things-to-bring" list is out. We can only bring at most $10. (wah!)   This is the end of my update, once again... Everything that has a beginning, has an end. But this is not the end, this is only the beginning! (Copyrighted by [ME]!!!)

       Happiness Depends On Fate After All  After the sad momments that Jennifer Hudson was voted out, I can't really express my delight that John Stevens is "kena" voted out too!! Look at the time of this post, which is still much too early from the announcement of the results. But believe me, I do have first-hand information! Bet Simon was cooed and pissed when he hears this! Dunno why Simon likes him so much, to me he isn't a very good singer. He keeps singing all those dreamy classics, boring... I think Stevens is more suited to sing some Christmas carols, maybe "Oh come, all ye faithful"?

       Surprise, Surprise  Looking at the list of the Project's Day PreliminarJudging results, i was filled with anticipation and anxiety... Will our team make it? It all depends a lot on this list. This list, is our lease of life... We are now one step closer to the $8000 prize money! :) You get what I mean? Yes, OUR TEAM MADE IT TO THE SEMI-FINALS!!!!!!!!!! Boy, I can't express my happiness when we saw that we have advanced to the semi-finals! Oh God, it was just like so unreal... We faced many obstacles upon completing the presentation, the lousy ppt we came up with, the presentation techniques... Mrs Nancy Tay, who was the 2nd judge, gave quite negative comments for our teams. I was really surprised that we were able to make it! Oh Praise The Lord! I will now attend even more Sunday services! Although I now have a sense of achievement, it's not really an achievement... Most of the teams did make it. But still, we must really thank God!    History Test Tml  Die liao, history test tml. This time, we were told that there won't be MCQs anymore, but some source-based questions and essay writing. This is the subject i have been fearing for... "It is very common to fail in my class," said our History teacher, Miss Teo. Okay, i agree that her teachings are informative and you won't survive her class without taking down notes. She often gave out valuable information all the time without knowing it herself, so note-taking is important. And, she always go outside the textbook, giving us notes which are more informative. But more informative, means more things to memorise... Must study now...   ks is absolutely right...  i certainly agree with ks over the junk mails thingy... my junk mail has reached its new record, 100% all used up, in just 3 hours. Clearing the junk mail folder has become part of my daily routine. Between revisions and homework, before dinner, after dinner, during TV time and even before i sleep. Surprisingly, when it was nearly 12am at night, i opened and cleared the junk mail folder. After that, i refreshed, 10 came in! It must be a record, 10 came in in just about 10 seconds, and so late at night! And interesting discover, by looking at the email addresses, i found that these kinds of mails all from Singapore or Malaysia etc. this means that the person who is behind all these must be someone around this region too! I also starting to wonder whether Hotmail even realise the problem or not. Singapore and this region only made up of a small percentage of its suscribers! So, whether Hotmail will investigate till the end? i really dunno... Hopefully the police is investigating this too!   New Quote  I really love this quote, "Life is meaningful only due to the fear of death." Indeed to me, life is actually quite meaningless. It's the same routine for everyone all the time, work, home, work, home. However,  God gave us the chance to live in this world becasue He believes in us. We are all in this world for some meaning beneath. Whether we will find the true meaning of life, it's up to us.  God put us through pain to let us realise meaning of life.  Really, life is where you choose your own path. We control our own lives, while God gives us chances. (This is sorta like a sermon, but i find this meaningful...)  Alright, to History textbook now. Life is meaningful only due to the fear of death. And remember, everything that has a beginning, has an end. It's how u control the end...

       She Bangs!  Talk to me... Okay, that's William Hung, not Ricky Martin. Channel 5 just broadcasted the William Hung MTV thingy... My comments? It completely sux! It's sorta William's making a show, then the director keep yelling "Cut!" And the singing and dancing was as awful as before. I think William's really related to animals (not music), his face look like LuoHan fish, and he dances like an elephant. While some others say he's really "All-American", my mum says his singing is like talking. Come on will, just because of 1 lousy audition, resulted in MTV?   All Was Not That Well  Today's the preliminary judging of the Project's thingy, and i must say my team dint presented quite well in the long run. The judges' comments were "not really related to topic" and "objectives are not right..."! Boy, i really feel like banging myself on the head after hearing that. I can't afford to fail... I really hope we can at least reach the semis. Oh God! May God bless us!    Again Another New Fashion Sense  Here it is, blog version 1.3 of my blog. ks says he prefer the previous one, i also dunnoe y... But in my personal opinion, i tink this is better lah. Because the previous one is well, too dull-looking, and it really gives the person a exhausted look. it's just like book cover, most people DO judge a book by it's cover. So, i dunno... But ks is qutie an expert in web designing, i should trust his eye-sight, shouldn't I?  These few days are sorta boring, so nothing much to write about... Well, so long!

       Junk Mail Craze  The junk mail situation is getting completely out of hand... Just today, i found my school principal sending me a message "Hi!". I did opened the email, thinking that he mass emailed everyone about something. Luckily when i saw it was the same attachment again, i quickly deleted it. Wonder who started all these stupid automatic junk mails, hope he's convicted of capital offense... Really, the person who started all these damn "bo liao". Like nothing to do like that. Now, i find myself in the prospect of clearing my junk mail folder every 1-2 hrs, wasting time and money (time is money). Hope Hotmail get this fixed soon. I found my Yahoo account to be junk-mail free....   Project's Day  Feeling nervous now, it's preliminary rounds for Project's Day tml... Hope we can get into semi-finals. To be frank, we completed our presentation in just 5 days, with around 12 slides. I'm presenting around 3 slides tml, in front of many other teams and 2 judges. Just hope that the judge is not Mr Jeffery Lim or Mrs Janey Sim. One judge is for sure, the head judge Mr Charles Low. I don't know his usual stadards, but he should be qutie "relaxed" lah, from my deduction :).   Flash rox!  In computer studies today, we learnt ActionScript in Flash and how to do a movie clip. It's quite complicated, and took ages to understand. Nevertheless, it was still fun. We learnt how to do buttons etc etc., call my crazy if u want, but i really luv the flashy lessons! Do amazing things with Macromedia Flash MX 2004!  I'm suffering from writer's block (not sure how u spell it), so nothing to write liao lah. okay, bye

       Bom Bee Bee  I'm so touched... ***sobsobsob*** Yifeng finally won in todae's bom bee bee... She has been losing since the 2nd episode, and todae she finally won... maybe because ann poh's in her team, i dunno... Anyway, what matters is she finally won!!! Whoo!!! Wang Lu Jiang deserved all those punishments todae! the red team (wang lu jiang) was given make-up, made to eat bananas with wasabi and later made to turn a few rounds! Ha! I hope the green team will win in the many episodes yet to come! Well, the red team... Who cares about them anyway, they won so many times already. Anyway, i USED to support wang lu jiang and the RED TEAM. but seeing yifeng to "ke lian", lose all the time, start to pity her loh...   aiyah, can't think of anything to talk about already... This post came as a sudden inspiration, after yifeng won, bye...

       Idiotic Junk Mails!!!  I don't know whether all of you are experiencing it or not, but lately, there's a lot of junk mails. For me, if i don't clear my junk mail folder every 2 hrs, it would have been flooded with more than 100 this kind of mails. I don't know which idiot started all these, but all the subjects are always, "hi", "let's be friends" and "information". Sometimes, there will be "message failure". I wonder if Hotmail knows about this, and i hope whoever started all these shall be put to jail! (yes, i'm feeling that violent now) Ironically, i found that i seem to be sending these kinds of mail too, but be assured that i didn't send them MANUALLY!!! I don't know why also, maybe my account contracted a virus that starts seding these stupid messages automatically. i even received one from my friend lablled "important!" and he sent me an attachment too. so i tot it's really important and in the end contracted i-worm/netsky.z. later when i asked him, he swore and crossed his heart that he dint do it... oh well...   Parasites...  The parasite problem is getting out of hand. everyday, i will unknowingly install a parasite program. so i have no choice but to install SpyBot. Then in the end i found out that "hey"!it's not a bad program after all, it removes many of my parasites already! those who are interested to download, u can do it from  urlLink download.com . Many common parasites are, Comet Cursors, My Web Search, N-Case (the most irritating that i find so far) and Gator.   SARS!!!  SARS broke out again in China. Singapore's public is reacting to it fast, the recent newspapers is all about the SARS outbreak! Personally, i'm quite scared of another outbreak, because we can't go out and no travelling and all those stuff. Come on SARS, why must break out again?! It's close to summer now, not winter! ANTI-SARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SARS is the virus, that i just want to minus... Anyway, why has SARS broke out again? i myself cannot find any apparent reason at all. it's just like a new virus formed, unless SARS go thru' biological changes once more?   Gas Prices up another 3 cents?  While the Iraqis are burning their oil wells, US gas prices leap at another 3 United States cents, making it USD 2.20 9/10 per gallon. The situation got so worse that gas stations have to make the drivers pay before they get their gas, so that the drivers cannot run off without paying. Don't think this will not affect Singapore! Last time when it went up to USD 2.00 9/10 per gallon, Singapore's petrol went up by 3 Singapore cents also. This time 20 US cents more, well... Not long after, Singapore's one also up by another 3 Singapore cents... Oh well, Iraqia and Arabians, why waste that oil???  All right, can't think of anything to mention liao. so must well end it. everything that has a beginning has an end... Sayonara!

       ks...  If u have noticed again, ks have come out with his 3rd design of his blog! Oh boy, i must really hand it up to him! Only with good time management like him, then u will be able to achieve, Everyone hats up for ks! His new design is even much better than mine, i must admit, with the theme from The Sims 2! everyone, tekan at the link below and take a look at ks's new blog!   Abortion Rights?  Thousands of demonstrators marched up Washington D.C, somewhat for abortion rights... It was somehow led by Senator Hiliary Clinton. Some call it the "worst constitutional rights ever", while others back against the Republicans for illegalising abortion.  "Stop the Violence!"  cried some human rights associations. This debate is much more complicated than just any Republican or Democrat Campaign, but a  "serious decision influential towards the whole globe" . My opinion is that, whatsoever woman rights, duh... I think abortions should be stopped as much as possible, it's pure cruelty and defies the right to live. It's murder of the life of an unborn foetus! Come on, america, think before u do anything...   My Vision!  Before i end this post like any others, i must first tell everyone that this year: 1) i must "pia" 2) i must get mean grade of 1.8 3) i must "jiayou" 4) i must attend more Sunday services 5) i must put my faith in God 6) i must achieve enough to fly back to New York (mean grade 1.5, my parents' target...)  Yah, i noe it's a bit too late to do some new year resolutions, let's make it Mid-Year Resolutions then! gtg, bye

Okay, i noe this is not a very beautiful blog and it may look even worse that last time. But at least, it's full of originality and all created by myself! Don't worry, more is yet to come... Maybe during the June Holidays, I will design even a better one! Comments? You can put it into the tagboard i will create later!

       Jealousy?  If you have noticed, ks have come out with a 2nd design of his blog! I wonder how he does that, with that horrendous amount of homework thrown at him plus projects... Alright let's not beat about the bush, i admit that sometimes i can be jealous of him (positive side of jealousy, not negative side) and will treat him as my "mo2 fan4", or model. Everyone who cannot manage time well enough, maybe you can consult him. Boy, i'm really amazed by how he manages his time, while everyone in Singapore often complaint with the modal answer, "no time!".   Father who was jailed  Yesterday's news, Father you-noe-who was jailed for 71/2 years for embezzlement of mllion of dollars in church fund. If I'm the judge (from what i understand, the judge is female), I would have sentence him to 20 years. Singapore laws doesn't really reflect much on embezzlement of religious groups. If it's embezzlement of money from a bank or something like that, it would have been much more than just 71/2 years. Still remember the guy from the beer company sentenced to life imprisonment? Stealing from a church should have been more severe than banks! Father Kang has betrayed the trust of the church-goers!    Moussaoui? Death Penalty?  US Supreme Court ruled that Moussaoui is most probably subjected to the death penalty. Moussaoui is suspected to be involved in the 911 attacks. Surprisingly, defense lawyers rebutted the court's decision as no fundamental rights and that he is not connected to Al-Qaeda in any way. Anyway, it's good enough that the death penalty talk in back in the table. However, certain district judges still rebutted of Moussaoui's constitutional right without a fair trial including video questioning with other county judges, besides the panal of 3 judges from the Supreme Court. The Grand Jury was also claimed "inadaptable" for a serious case such as the Al-Qaeda. Meanwhile, Moussaoui confessed of being in league with Osama Bin Laden but not involved in 911. Still, i think the whatsoever constitutional rights should change in leauge that the court case can have a bigger scope of focus and also charge Moussaoui with being in league with Osama even if not involved in 911. If Moussaoui is released and reunited with Al-Qaeda, wouldn't that be a great disaster? My final "decisions"? The Supreme Court is right for the death penalty and i'm fully behind it. Who knows how many other lifes will they take the next time? Electrocution is not enough for such people, their cruelty has caused hundereds and thousands of lifes! They should be sentenced straight to poison gas, or even maybe drowning! Moussaoui's case is scheduled to be continued on April 28 (day of preliminary of project's day).

       MSN Messenger 6.2!!!  I have downloaded the latest MSN Messenger 6.2. Wanna noe how is it like? It's quite a disappointment for me actually! There's not much of a difference prior to 6.1. Yes, it offers better security that solves netowrking problems automatically. Yes, if offers more games like Wheel of Fortune (only 14-day trial period, after that have to buy). Now, before u can type finish the coding for emoticons (for example: :)), they turn it into an emoticon itself already, in the past, u will still see the code happily showing itself there. And instead of calling it launch site programs, they now call it fun and games. More practical eh? ;) Thinking of download now? Go to this website then:  urlLink http://messenger.msn-int.com/Download/ . However for MSG Plus users out there, beware... You will need to download a new MSG Plus Version to ensure compatibility with 6.2. Pls also be reminded that even with this new version, it will still have some problems when using 6.2! MSG Plus 3, total compability with 6.2, shall only be release somewhere in the last period of spring (late May). MSN Messenger Version 7.0 shall only be released in winter this year.   Gmail  Most probably to rival with Hotmail, Google introduced a new email server Gmail. I'm have  "kiasuly" signed myself up. This new email system offers 1 GB of space to each member (yes you read it right, 1 GB!!!) Such a comprehensive service... To round it up, there are no ADs (only the Google types, if u get what i mean) here and the server is so much faster! (my hotmail takes 30s to load finish, and my connection speed is 1500kb). With that 1 GB, you will never have to worry about mails flooding ur good ole Hotmail account anymore. However, it's meant for Blogger users only, so... Anyway, out of that gigantic size of 1 GB, i have only 1 mail. anyone feeling "bo liao" can email me at jensentan1991@gmail.com...   Chinese Lately  Today's the first Chinese Test we sat for that was set by our new Chinese teacher-in-training (last year in primary school prefects-in-training are called PITs, or rather prefect-in-toilet........), Mr Sunny Chong. Just like his name, he can be quite cheerful and qute fun. Speaking of Chinese test, well... I'm mentally prepared to get at least a F9, so don't worry about me...  Just out of pure and innocent curiosity, we asked him yesterday what EP3 was he in. He just shook his head and told us to find out ourselves... This is the first time our class felt so "cold" in his class after so many weeks...  Aiya, "wu2 hua4 ke3 shuo1" already lah. Now u must agree with me, everything that has a beginning will have an end. beginning of a new idea also come to a stop...

       New Fashion Sense...  Okay, i have now decided to have a new look ("websites should be very neat" computer teacher) of my blog. I already entered the 1st code to make the website. Completion shall be estimated to by the end of June holidays (really no time, so pissed with the Project's Day). Hopefully, there won't be collapse of DreamWeaver during the digging... (do u get what i trying to say?)   Nicoll Highway  Alright i admit, i use this road as often as the President. i was totally shocked and devasted upon hearing the news from none other than ks at around 5pm that day. it was almost like seeing 911 again with all the rubble. and now the ***dunnoe stupid or clever*** decide to cut up Merdeka Bridge. Have they ever well estimated the cost of joining it again? Come on people, don't get digging underground all the time. when there's no more support down there (like a tension formation of rift valley, i just learnt todae :)), the whole Singapore's gonna collpase, not only Nicoll Highway! Come on, Gahmen (Singlish for Government), build some of the things above ground lah! It's so much effective in cost. Lately, we must say that the Gahmen is having a lot of projects underground, underpasses, circle line, northeast line and whatever line and so on. Maybe the Gahmen should consider having underground houeses too...    Blackout?!  It was late at night, at around 11.45am. I got up slowly from my chair, and went to the kitchen to get a drink. And suddenly, " pop ", i sorta turned blind. i was scared out of my soul, and went to get a torch. it was the most devasting, groping around in darkness. dont' expect street lamps to help u get around, it's aboslutely nothing. there were also no corridor ligh, no handphone light, only torch ligh, "car-light" from the street, and computer light. after that i went to slp, and by next morning... Hey presto! the light is on again... **lame**   Joyful, Joyful (but it's not Christmas)  Lately, I'm having a lot of freedom, i'm sorta so joyful that as if Christmas is only weeks away. Both my parents are overseas (with occasional irritating international calls), one enjoying himself somewhere extremely far away from the red dot near the Equator, while the other one is still in the Asian boundary. It's computer games, more American Idol, and more MSN Chat! Too bad, there's someone else in our house who keeps nagging away, my maid...   Cut here and cut there?  In correspondence to a short movie clip i watched, i now know that there are 6 cuts in The Talented Mr Ripley, 2 cuts in Titanic, 2 cuts in Chicago, 4 cuts in dunnoe-what-else. I also reflected that horror movies are often cut in many gorry and bloody scence (no wonder lately horror movies not scary 1), what's the point of watching a horror movie then? And the highest record ever cut by the Board of Censors? 27 cuts, made in the Singaporean film "15". Lately, a rumour spread that 5 cuts were made in Kill Bill Vol.2, and it's still rated M18!!! Come on lah, Singapore Gahmen, other countries also not like this what. All films (except NC17) in America are available to people from all ages (for toddlers even when the movie is rated R (Restricted, Children under 17 must be accompanied by adult)). Can't the Gahmen be more open  (I really want to watch Kill Bill!)? Now then did i know that the expert chopping on the film strip by the censors helped the Pirated DVD Association in JB for a 65% rise in net profit! Gahmen, do you still want Golden Village and Eng Wah to continue losing money?    Elections coming...  Okay, the Republicans and the democrats are at absolute loggerheads with each other. Personally, i prefer Republicans (dunnoe y also) which means i sorta support current US President George Dubdew Bushit. Well, voting is in November and Senator Kerry + Bushit (this is not a chemical equation) are now producing ADs in the American TV. Bushit sucks a lot, still dare to mention 911 and Iraq War. Speaking of Bushit, he and his Dick Chenney give tax refunds but  raise gas prices (gas prices now cost USD 2.10 9/10 per gallon, EXTORTION!) it's twice as much as the prices in Singapore... So i tink Kerry will still win lah...   Hoot-U?  This seem to be favourite quote recently. I realised that i keep scolding people hoot-u. and also, i like to play about with the word hoot-u. Reflections: What do this word really means? y is singlish so "entertaining"? Hoot-u, i don't want to think also... suffering from stresssssssss, brain power is extremely low...  Aiya, can't think of anything else to say already lah, bye bye. Everthing that has a begnning, shall ALWAYS have an end...

       Bom Bee Bee  I'm a great fan of this show and i'm sad to know that it's the last 2 episodes already. So... Haiz... Although this show going to end liao, the green team still lost today. It's just so annoying lah... Bei Chek!   Singapore Idol judges... Nvr even heard of them be4  To tell you honestly, i clean forgotten their names liao. It's just like... nvr even heard of them be4... There are basically 4 judges rather than the usual 3. MediaCorp acting smart again and try to be more "original". My sister said, "For goodness sake, if they want to be original, change the "Singapore Idol" icon to red colour lah, y blue colour again?" Hey, that's sounds like a good idea! Red may look nice and it reflects part of the national flag. Red background and white text! Hey, doesn't look too bad too!

      Hi there. Just returned from school!   Website Maintenance Done  For those of you who cried, screamed or criticised my blog like Simon Cow, here, you got it. I just maintained the website, add some links, change the outlook etc. Now, any other comments, either positive or negative, of course you may email me or chat me up in MSN. Thanks for your valuable feedback!   Test schedule out, sianz...  Haiya... It's still the beginning of June holidays and the school is bothering and trying to worry us. They have given out the test schedule out for Term 3. Now i can't even play peacefully with the worry for the test in my mind.. Haiz... There's still MRP and project work to worry about liao... Now another test schedule happily come along! For those curious ones or those un-alert CHS students out there, u can visit this website to check it out.  urlLink Website    Going ice-skating  Tml is my last day in Singapore before the trip and I'm indeed happy that I'm going ice-skating tomorrow. It's fun, enjoyable but painful with blisters as well. And of course, it's as good as making a hole in your purse but i think that's worth it. Come on, it's holidays!

      As most of you may already know, I have this habit of leaving my computer on whenever i do my hw, revise or when bathing etc. Now my mum is getting all jittery due to my "horrendous" results (i feel she's over-reacting a little, come on, my mean grade is still better than the class, there are bound to be subjects where i'm weaker in compared to the class average). Whenever she sees me over-looking the com, she would like scold me and say that i'm chatting all the time using MSN!

      Well, if you have read the last post of ks today (May 29), he said I have a lot of broken English in my quotes etc. And I like to use Mother Nature... Now, i shall step forward for my defence! First of all, everyone should know that I love Nature more than anything else in the world (except my family). For proof, check out the theme of this blog, it's based on Nature too... Secondly, those quotes are mostly my own quotes and i can assure you that they are not meant to be in Singlish or whatsoever. Most of the time my fingers are tap-dancing on the keyboard while writing every post, so a few mistakes are unavoidable. To err is human  what ?  ps. and btw ah, ks, it's  proper english , not  correct english ... =P

      It's holidays, holidays of our lives, our lives...   Curfew launched...  "Listen son, you are not going to carry on with your horrendous results!" my mum screamed last night when she saw my progress report... sigh, now curfew is launched. i'm not allowed to on the com nor even touch it unless i complete all my hw! What the h**k! Aiya, nvm lah, striving for a better tml. After this, i will prevail with much better results! Still, i'm allowed 1 hour per day, not bad lah. still unlimited tv...   Wow, so many ex-classmates!  Recently, i have rejoined and rebuilt the old friendship with my ex-ex-primary school classmates. Suddenly, they have all appeared everywhere. I have met up with quite a few at Chinese High alone, then i continued to met with some from other schools. BTPS ex-classmates also met some of my ex-ex classmates. Just today, another ex-ex-classmates added me to his contact list! Wah, Singapore really that small leh!   Now enjoying the last few moments of liberty and freedom before the curfew... haiz... Humans have really gotten too smart even for Mother Nature... Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tml... - Jensen Tan

      Wah! Today i got a lot of things to write leh!   Ice-Skating was thus erm...  I broke an all-time record! Yes u read it right! I broke an all-time record! I fell down an achievable 8 times today on the ice rink while practicing ice-skating, breaking the record of the orginal 7 made by another classmate! (oh btw, the whole ProEd sec 1 went ice-skating) But then, at least i'm of the the "braver" ones who really tried to skate, while others held on to the railings while skating along. Alright, to be honest, i know how to roller-blade, which means performing so badly in ice-skating is "an insult to my mentality" (haha, lame...)even when you have the experience. Ice-skating was indeed fun, but the rental charges very expensive, haiz...   No this will not do!  Received my term progress report today. Took a little peek before completely opening the booklet, can break into tears i tell u! I got a mean grade of about 2.66 (or at least i think...), dropped from 2.13 last term! Arghh! 2 of my subjects, English and Integrated Humanities, dint even meet average mark, i was like so pissed that i can tear the report slip... Arghh, so frustrated with myself! But the other subjects still not bad lah, homework deadline and quality most of them also achieved an Excellent grade. Subject teachers also gave quite positive comments! I particularly like this comment from the Chinese teacher, "守规勤学“. It's amazing how he used just merely 4 words, while other teachers broke into hysterical moments and wrote many lines when inspiration struck them. oh btw, the chinese teacher gave the whole class the same comment, "守规勤学“！   Thus far we had came  The path of life is always filled with uncertainty with obstacles you can expect at all times. There are always at least 2 paths to take, one which u will suffer first but reach luxury later, while the other will lead you to luxury and make u suffer even more later. Which path would you take? Is it the red path or the blue path? Well, i'm pleased to announce here the my Chinese website designing team took the red path (or rather suffer first), and we are now enjoying bliss after the hardship. Indeed, we have spent sleepless nights trying to complete the website, endured the test put within by the Mother of life by the criticisms made by our mentor. But, still we can see, as time passes by, there's dream in our minds, and we are going to achieve it! and we did! Okay, to sum it all up, our team got into the finals of National Chinese Web-designing competition! Everybody wish me gd luck and get first okay?   Holidays, holidays, holidays  Our vacation has finally come. The time for me to prove myself has came! The real obstalces are in front of us and Mother of life is watching over us! This vacation is not meant for only vacation only. It's the time to prove our capabilities and our critical-thinking minds, to create a new vision. The vision of doing well in our MRP and project's day, to enhance our test results! I can see the vision just in front of me, and i'm going nearer and nearer to achiving it! The June holidays have provided me a short-cut to reach this vision faster, and i'm going to treasure it! I have started a new vision myself, and it starts right NOW! i'm going to achieve it! My mind is now focussed on academic and other school stuff, less focussed on other activities such as playing. Everybody be my witnesses! Strive I must and achieve I will! Strive for the best! =)   Oh Mickey!  We used this song for line-dancing last year. And by pure accident, i found the lyrics on the web:  (Oh Mickey, you're so fine you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey) (Oh Mickey, you're so fine you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey) (Oh Mickey, you're so fine you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey)  Hey Mickey!You've been around all night and now that's a little long You think you've got the right but I think you've got it wrong Why can't you say goodnight so you can take me home, Mickey  'Cause when you say you will, it always means you won't You're givin' me the chills, baby, please baby don't Every night you still leave me all alone, Mickey  Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand It's guys like you Mickey Oh, what you do Mickey, do Mickey Don't break my heart, Mickey Hey Mickey!

Hey Mickey!   I have now chosen a path of obstacles and the price hidden among the midst of obstacles... Everything depend on one self's being.

       Oh say, can you see? (the American Idol)  Fantasia won the American Idol! Basically, there wasn't much singing tonight, haiz... but i do like watching the 1-hour special on 10-11pm. The americans do have manners, sang national anthem and saluted before the competition started. Then the contestants who were voted out came back to sing a few songs. simon was in black again, or rather he looks "cool" in executive wear.;

      For simply no reason, i have this sudden urge to update my blog (yeah!!) although there's nothing much to write.   Harry Potter... So much enthusiasm...  Don't get mistaken, i'm not a potter fan. somehow, i got this sickening feeling when i saw today's zaobao, a pic of a girl holding up a sign, "Marry Me, Daniel!". Nope, i can assure u it's not jealousy (i rather pray that i have excellent results), but others in class have the same feeling too, it's downright disgusted... Although not a fan, but i'm somehow overwhelmed by the enthusiasm (or to put it crudely, kiasuism) of singaporeans, i definitely won't feel comfortable when others have watched the movie and i haven't. still, if lord of the rings or pyscho were to come out at the same time, i would rather watch them first. oh btw, somehow i'm love the old movie pyscho a lot, maybe because of the scene of the bates motel.    Boring lessons  Since after the tests, we seem to get even more boring lessons all the time. Geogrpahy was some lesson interesting and enlightening, but now we are just watching some videos of earthquakes and study totally crap stuff like batholith (some big piece of formation of solidified magma...), laccolith (something like a batholith, but smaller in size and mushroom shaped) and lapolith (saucer-shaped, usually found in between admist the layers of rocks). Okay, it's not that crap after all and still a little of interest hidden in there, but it was just 40 minutes with everybody "huhing" and it's downright irritating. (ps. SICKENING! lol, ex-6c members should know what this means!)Also, we also learn terms like sill, dike and pipes. Forgot what they are liao, so many things to memorise... Haiz, i'm getting on with my age...   American Idol down to finak 2  American finally have the sense of hearing and the "class". They finally voted jasmine trias out, she should have gotten out longer in my opinion. yes, she can still sing quite well, but still lose to jennifer hudson (cries...) and la toya london. it's suppposed to be a tough fight now, with the best singers of america, looking forward to it! :D btw, hawaii has declared may 13 (can't remember the date well) as jasmine trias day... lame rite? she's just a contestant of American Idol and she dint even win the title!   Sleeping is essential as part of the life process... ZZZ...

       Don't talk so much lah  After Quan Yifeng won last week, she began her habit of talking a lot in this week's episode of bom bee bee. She could have won again, but she spent so much time talking to the guy who was going to gelyang bahru, the final destination. Arghhh!!! It's just so close!! Next week is the last time i'm going to watch bom bee bee be4 going for my trip, she must win!!! (oh btw, the idiotic airliner somehow mixed up the departure dates wrongly, got a shock when we went to receive our tickets...)   Going to buy electronic games soon ^-^!  Soon, i will have another whole box of video games! electronic games are cheap in new york (especially walmart, around USD 16 for a REAL version! only abt S$28-30, singapore cost $40 at least!!! xbox...) Anyway, i dun tink i will buy the real version. pirated version in the US are as good as the real version, 110% much better than the Johor pirated CDs. But still, since real version so cheap, why not buy some for real exp. instead?   PS3  Been eyeing the PS 3 in the US for quite some time, since my last visit to Ontario Mills, CA. last year. It's quite "x", about USD 168 (but compared to singapore, still cheaper leh...). Quite determined to buy it, but the plug is different and it's very difficult to use voltage adaptors all the time. Also, it's not easy to bring the whole machine back to signapore by luggage... So, aiyah dint buy lah! sorta regret it later... maybe i will be a bag specialised for this next time, hope it won't get checked in into the aircraft due to restrictions! or i must well wait for it to come out in singapore...  It's getting late, got to do what everybody got to do at nite! (别想歪！）

      A quick update for the first time in 5 days...   ProEd Nite... It's lame...  In case u r wondering, ProEd is my consortium (something like the House system used in other schools) and the council organized a ProEd Nite last night, which was Friday. It basically sux, only everyone singing some lame songs on stage. The overall theme? Hawaiian... But u dun feel Hawaiian at all, even though quite a few no. of ppl (including teachers) wore Hawaiian shirts. The "dinner" or rather supper we got was a bar of Milo, something like a melting chocolate bar. It wasn't even fun at all, unlike the Fun Day last year in good ole BTPS. Basically, treasure hunt was in the program sheet and i'm looking forward to it. But somehow, it's cancelled... So, it's just a nite of American Idol with William Hung... And there was this Mr Macho competition which was even lamer. Some guys are qutie macho i agree (i'm NOT gay), while some classes stupidly (including my class) sent up some fatso (i'm not trying to tease those ppl, just being frustrated at how some classes can sabo their classmates very well...) like Ruben Studdard. It was so damn retarded, with just some fatso who was there unwillingly posing some stupid pose. Some fat but quite muscular ones were indeed sporting and still managed to suppress a smile... What's really the points of this competition? when certain competitors were half-naked and strated showing their butt-clad underwear, in front of parents, teachers and all... Of course that guy dint win the title and maybe he would have won it if he wore a g-string... =P   Results revealed...  ks said he did badly when he scored 4 As... but what abt me???  English - B4 Maths - A2 Chinese - A1 Science - B3 History - C5 Geography - A2 Literature - B3 Computer - A1  ks, be contented with ur results... dun be a loser like me... =X   It's now another end.

They could have reach the destination, Sembewang, even faster loh. There's a boy who was going to Sembewang but answered the questions wrongly... Sigh... But nvm, what matter most is the green wins again! but looking at the short film of next week, i tink they lose again lah... wah piam!

      Really nothing much seem to happen nowadays, so talk abt some very wu liao things lah!   MRP (Major Research Paper)  The 3rd submission is starting. This submission is the draft of the final paper itself. ARGHHH!!! I think i'm goin crazy, i dun even understand the format of the final submission... How do you write a research paper? Those who know and feeling wu liao can email me and tell me. Not only those wu liao, those not wu liao got free time also can email me! OH, i'm doing the topic on Hitler, so got time do some mini research for me! ;) =P Haha, thanx!   Jue Shi Hao Bra?  Yes, u guess it. I watched (though i'm not a pervert) jue shi hao bra yesterday. It was a damn pervertic show only perverts would want to own it in dvd... I'm telling ya that it's 101% worse than Legally Blonde (at least it's still a movie from hollywood...) i dunnoe.....    Troy  Judging from the gibberish (there is really such word in the English dictionary) reviews, i have decided not to watch Troy. A summary of the reviews given, "This is a big epic battle scene. But the fight is sorta so unreal... There is nothing much else to see other than fighting, unless you want to count seeing Brad Pitt's naked butt." (yikes...) Girls, if it's a dream come true for u, go for that butt... But dun say i dint warn u, many critics and viewers have deemed it a show of only fighting. Oh, btw, it's given the R rating by MPAA for violence, language and sexuality/nudity.   It's Monday...  Time passes indeed swiftly and it's Monday once again. Monday means another day of bom bee bee... Aiya, i tink i can bet that quan yifeng will lose again today lah, with dick su... Bets start at $10! Buy with me thru' email!   Comments  A lot of people after reading the posts of this blog, email me to give comments, as a results flooding my email. In case u dint see it (sry i dun mean to be sacarstic), there's a comment hyperlink at the bottom of every post. For more personal comments, of course u r allowed to email me (by Gmail pls). But for others that are more bo liao one (means post for fun one lah) can post it thru' the comment lah. so far ks is the only one commenting that way... Btw, a big THANK YOU for those who have visited and gave positive comments of this blog. PS. in case if u r wondering where the counter is, well, i admit that i'm too lazy to put it in (and to add in the links, but dun worry, i will add the links soon, but maybe i shouldn't say soon, haha..). but judging by the number of emails (sry to say, but by junk mails as well =P), still another THANK YOu for visitng my blog!  Aiya, must do hw liao... sianz...

       Haiz...  A short post today. My trip is now put forward to first week of June. Just yesterday it was around 2nd week, and now it's first week. It's not our fault that we keep changing the date, but the airline company (incidentally United Airlines) put forward us, as there "were no enough tickets for all of us". Luckily we will be staying over at our relatives' house. Or we would have been surcharged for the change of our dates at the hotel...    Sabbaticals...  The Hwa Chong Sabbticals, well... I can't say that it has been fun... For the first few days, we were just lamely sitting down there and listen to the ppt prepared by the trainer (anonymous). LOL, but there were candies to lighten us up! Whenever we felt like sleeping and slacking, the trainer would very kindly sponser us with candies. So fellow "Sabbaticalns", feel sleepy more! So we can get more candies! Today is the highlight of the whole Sabbaticals, we were allowed to debate (aiya, more crude-sounding means quarrel lah)! But... my team still lost...

The punishment today, is for them to dress up as Indian ladies (yes including Dick Su!!!) and perform some sort of Indian Dance. They dance like hell, much worse than Bollywood concert! Aiya, i lose faith in them already, now i'm the neutral side, although my sis now all the time shout at them to move faster, as they always talk rubbish with the passers-by...   June Vacation  Since my last post in the afternoon, a lot of ppl been asking me for my whereabouts (yes recently i publicise my blog, mostly to cousins, but they dunno where i going too). So i have decided to give some clues...  Hint #1: It's somewhere far far away. It will take about 21 hours flight (including transit) to reach there.  Hint #2: I can now watch American Idol live from Fox Channel. Yes, live! Which means i will noe the results sooner than all of u. But by the time, the new American Idol should be out already lah... :(  Hint #3: This city i'm going has rude service and the airports are one of the worst, but be sure that it isn't China or Africa etc. Oh, a major tragedy also once happened there.  Okay, u should be able to guess now. If u still cannot, wait till i change my profile's location lah... So remember, also dun call my hse phone too, from 3rd week to 4th week, or rather the last 2 week of June holidays. Pass this message to as many ppl possible.  PS Anyway, just crossing my fingers that my parents won't cancel the trip last minute. Nowadays a lot of things happening to the country i'm going... Just hope that lately nothing else will happen.

       Pls take note  Hi everyone reading this! Pls take note that my overseas trip is confirmed liao. So i'm leaving Singapore on 3rd week of June and is expected to return on middle of 4th week. So during this period, for those of u who knows or dunno my hp no., pls dun call. Even if it's something really important and u call, don't be surprised if u get extra high phone bills. No, it's not just a few cents per minute, but if i'm did remmeber correctly, it's around $2 per minute (AT&T Wireless charge until like siao one). Also, the time difference is damn big so even if u call in the afternoon, you may be well calling me at midnight. Of course you are welcomed to email me, but pls email to my Gmail account, as i dun want my Hotmail to be flooded. For those of u out there who knows my whereabouts, pls keep it a secret as i really want a peaceful vacation.   PS I can't really write a long entry to to time constrictions nowadays... so long!

      Dint update my blog, for let's see, 3 days? KS is fuming away, "update ur blog !!!" The schedule for these few days are murderous! Btw, ks lost all his files and settings because his computer something wrong lah. So he asked me to sympathize with him, so "ke lian" him loh.   Idiotic SP2  Thinking of downloading Windows XP SP2? Well, i would advise you not to. Because of downloading this, my whole com corrupted and also lose all my files and settings etc. etc. Luckily my father was able to recover them, but ks just isn't that fortunate...   Exams over!  Exams (or rather tests) are finally over! I have suffered weeks of clogging for the tests and the emotional attacks of getting low grades all the time! Really, my MSG must have dropped by dunnoe how much (means a lot lah) compared to last term. But i again will not take failure in my stride. "You can cry now, but you must get up later..." This is Mrs Lee's "motto" for us last year. So i will take her advice and strive even for better results! From Level 3 of studying, i will now switch to Level 5 (highest level)! Or maybe becasue i'm sitting at the back of the classroom, so distracted most of the time.  Okay, that's all i have to say... Watching "Good Gracious Me!" now...

       SQ Hijack?  LAX was reported to have received a signal from SQ 20 (the long-haul flight to Los Angeles). Federal Aviation Authority immediately responded by sending a F-16 (whoa!!) to escort the landing of the light at Tom Bradley Int. Terminal. SWAT (wah!!!**Special Weapons and Tatics police=D**), FBI, and some negotiation team went up, only to find that it was a false alarm. Wow, i sorta hope that i am in this flight...   Flunk My History Test  Today, received back my History test... As expected, i nearly flunk it, with just a passing mark of 10/20! But rest assured that i won't take failure in my stride! "Use this as a wake up call!" and "You can cry now, but you must get up later!" were what Mrs Lee always said to us last year. This is precisely what i am going to do next! I have devoted 3/4 of my time all to studying and revision right now! I'm going to prevail as a succeedor the next time! "And this be my motto, In God is Our Trust!" This may be useful now, so may God bless me!    Holidays coming!!! (more of an account)  Holidays is only a few weeks away! Boy, i'm so happy as if it's December holidays and Christmas is here! The first semester for my secondnary school life has indeed been rocky, very rocky. There are new challenges set before and ahead from now. There's Project's Day and MRP. I can't say that i've been coping with my studies very well. From the "after-effects" of the more than 2 months "holiday' after PSLE, i found that i myself is currently more prone to using the computer, watching tv etc. etc. I believe if i can overcome these bad habits, i can achieve even better! From the guidiance of Mrs Lee and Mdm Wang last year, i can say that actually they had develop a sort of "beginnings" in us. The hetic lifestyle last year by Mrs Lee has prepared us well for this year! I still remember that she always made us talk, make sure that we always have the initiative etc. This is similar to that of my teachers this year, especially our History teacher Miss Teo. ("Yes? No? Answer!!!") I think i will go back to BTPS definitely on Teacher's Day!  Okay, that's all I have to say. Because there's nothing more for me to say, as it's the end after the beginning... Next update? Who knows...

       Dick SU!!!  i'm so sad today... ***sobsobsob*** Quan Yifeng lost again in bom bee bee... All because of DICK SU!!! Last week, wang lu jiang lost because of dick su!!! and this week, well... The punishment for this week is really damn "cham"! Each member is to find some coins in a box of either worms, cockroaches or frogs. Yeah, it's something much like Fear Factor... However, it's even worse!!! The "victims" are blindfolded, so they have no idea at all at where they are touching inside the box. Dick Su got the box of cockroaches, he has no idea at all that he's actually touching some cockroaches! Well, i don't think i want to watch bom bee bee anymore... yifeng keeps losing, very "bei chek"...

       Gmail rox!  Wow! I kinda like Gmail a lot. Not only does it offers 1 GB of storage and no banners etc., it also groups all emails with the same subject together (they call it conversation...). In goold ole Hotmail, all mails come as separate, whether they are under the same subject or not. AND, it offers a search engine in your veey own email account to search for whatever mail you wish to find (this is going to be helpful while flashing back at the archives). Yes, with 1 GB of storage, you will never have to delete any other email again! Whoa, now that i'm typing "1 GB" all the time, it seems so unbelivable. 1 GB... = 1000MB... - 2MB... = 998MB Yes! 998 MB more than your Hotmail! or 994 MB more than your Yahoo! Great job Google!   Michael Jackson the Star  Yes indeed, Michael Jackson appeared at Santa Maria courthouse wearing specs for the first time as long as i noe. When the judge read out the charges, he was seen as being a silent figure and still denied the charges. Michael Jackson really made the headlines, now being judged under the Grand Jury!! If found guilty to all charges, Michael can be jailed for 74 years (not sure whether true or not, but 74 years is something like given the 99-year life sentence), this means he's gotta spend the next part of his life in jail! From what i noe, this ain't the first time Michael was charged with child "abuse", but he was charged with the same charges years ago, my parents told me. This time Michael arrived 45min before the session, rather than the 1 hour late the last time. Also, disappointingly Michael dint jump up his car this time and "performed". I really hope he would do that, but at least now he proves that he has a sense of shame...   Murder at West Mall!!!  Located only about 5 miles away from my house, there's a murder at West Mall! The alleged suspect just stabbed the victim, 5 stabs at the chest and 1 stab on the neck! It's sure horrifying enough... My family that day was still planning to go to the library at West Mall, but in the end we dint go. The murderer was charged today in court. He could face the death penalty, although he's only 18.   Hostage from Macon, Missisipi  Amercian hostage from Macon escaped from his captors yesterday! It was really a sigh of relief! However, those "bu shuang" Iraqis all killed the US soldiers being held! It was reported that soldiers were abusing the Iraqi prisoners as well, ahlthough i'm sure not all of them do this. Come on, not all soldiers are "wicked". Sigh, when will this war end? After looking at some articles today, i'm now as equally positive that Bush may win this election as well... So maybe the war may continue... Sigh... Peace  Well, that's all for these 2 days. Lost time is never found again, the time when i end my post now is 6:38:51, Monday, May 3, 2004. It's sure that this specific time will not ever appear again... Time is just an illusion, time is just a man-made system, which reflects nothing on Nature at all! Day and night is then the real time given by Nature...

       Beautiful Las Vegas  I have changed the picture from a highway to my hometown, Las Vegas. Las Vegas is beautiful indeed, isn't it? I'm still trying to make the picture bigger, so that it's clearer. Please do note that the picture is copyrighted by Las Vegas Chamber of Conference. If i would to recommend a place to visit for vacation, it will definitely be Las Vegas. Not only you can gamble (children under 21 not allowed, haha, sry!), but it's realyl an Entertainment City. If you can't get enough of Genting (Genting follows the theme of Las Vegas), go on to Las Vegas. Brief introduction of Las Vegas: a city, twice the size of Singapore, with a population of 400,000, located in South-East of State of Nevada. A place of family entertainmenet, 24 hours of day and night life, but it's NOT Geylang. Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas, Nevada!   History Test Yesterday  As predicted, History was a killer-paper. It's much like the English test set by Mrs Lee last year, I'm not even sure now that whether i can pass. overall, die liao lah!  Nothing seem to happen much nowadays. So nothing much to write. So long!

      Just wanna say that i added 2 new links under bloggers. welcome aboard! ks, i have found another Sims 2 fan. visit victor gan's blog.   Finally...  Finally, i finished reading Village By The Sea. It consists of about 260 pages. The first 100 pages may bore you to death. i took about 3 days to read the first 100 pages. but amazingly, i took 2 hrs to finished the remainding 160 pages. Amazing eh?   Bala Krishnan  Bala Krishnan (the indian audio clip below) has brought me trouble. my family's got so tired of it that i was chided. everytime i see it, i would be tempted to listen to it. it go so intense that it's sorta of an addiction. so, the audio clip here must go also. nvm, find some enw music loh. haiz... anyway, the name bala krishnan would remind me of kala, the ortus english teacher. she's a white-indian who looks so much like a chinese that u won't believe she's an indian at first.

       Another thing, Jensie's school(CHS) teaches C++ which is so much better! C++ is quite hard to learn by reading a book, you need some real instructors to teach you and make it some much easier. His first program, unfortunately, is not the customary 'Hello World'. Never mind, maybe he did that in school.   well, so far my C++ teacher has been quite nice and explained in quite a clear way. able to understand him at the very least. my first program, well... it's modified from a certain website. don't fret, ks, it's also because of the guidance from my dearest brother and my father, that i succeeded. so really UNFORTUNATELY, it's not fully done by myself. yes, i wrote and hand-conded the code but it was them 2 who rectified the mistakes.

      How's first day of school?!?!?! Okay loh...   Quah's lesson  Quah (english and literature) was supposed to have 2 periods (80min) today. After we greeted her with that usual unenthusiastic voice, we were told to open the top windows. Just after that, our Chinese teacher thought it was his period and came in to interrupt for 5 minutes. quah first asked us abt our holidays, then talked abt her own experiences, mostly about SLC (Student's Leader Convention, held annually in chs). she talked abt certain foreign delegates (during their tour around sg) like wanted to stop at zig-zag traffic lines (means cannot stp at all), just to take a picture of the Singapore River and them wanting to shop at Watsons. Although she did specified the country, i would strongly suspect either India or Iraq. Not because i really look down on them, but common sense will tell u that their country would never have Watsons. And most of the time these ppl are poor and seldom have the chance. I dint choose china because chinese ppl some are even richer than us. most of them would have seen much  bigger  rivers than us... Oh well... After that, we proceeded to do some reflections and goal-setting. 2 periods passed juz like that...   Assembly  There was a part of assembly quite ah...  restricted . It's talking about those teenager's things, the u-noe-what lah. so if u want more details, catch me on msn.   History with teocm  Teo did not start off asking how are we and all these kinds of stuff. she went striaght on to the lesson, and doing revision on the topics of the last semester. today, she gave out one flying kiss (she does that everytime when difficult questions are answered perfectly) and said "i luv u!" to that guy. to round it all up, i juz have to say that she's perfectly emotional as usual. try not to spoil her good mood, or something will sure happen...   Chinese with tangc  tangc did not do any lesson or particularly  academic  at all. he first rant off about reading  xi you ji , then he spent the remaining half an hr talking about the website competition. as he made classmates to stand up and talk about their reflections and conclusion, this rather gave me an insight to their thoughts. juz todae, surrendered the trophy over to him for him to display on his table. but nvm, the tweeny weeny little trophy proved to be rather an eyesore and heart-breakening scene. Oh well...    just a note here to all readers, can you at least just post a tweeny weeny little comment so that i noe u r there? Thanks!

      Was browsing thru' blogs just now.   Firstly, i must comment that i have accidentally found the blog of my classmate. I nvr knew he got a blog!! going to confront him tml. =D Will add a link soon... too lazy to add now.  Secondly, ks used to (take note of the phrase "used to") promise that he will update his blog EVERYDAY. Well, from the situation i'm looking at right now, it's weekly, not everyday. Oh well...  Thirdly, chee yew (chainerboi a.k.a. cy) erm... has been under construction for his new blog for a long long time. it always say that it will end at 4.30pm, but... Oh well... click on the link below (under bloggers) to see what i mean.   Fourthly, zhong han's (a.k.a. zonny) rarely update his blog. so muz applaud for him since he updated the saturday before last (June 21). his latest blog update is abt, oh well... check it out for yourself. yoyoyo... tml muz confront him also.

      Well, i'm feeling damn bored now (what do you expect i can do at 12.30AM in the morning?!), so update the blog to pass my time. Nope, it's not because i want to catch soccer match later, but it's my last day that i can slp late, so must treasure it wisely! The "art" of sleeping late... I'm one of the owls that many ppl call, it's extremely usual for me (during holidays, weekends etc.) to sleep at 4am and wake up at 12pm (8 hrs of slp fufilled). **grins**   Euro 2004  England out, France also out, Spain out too, Germany also out. All the stronger soccer teams out, now the whole competition seem so empty. Judging by the situation now, i think the finals would be Portugal VS Czech Republic. but then, Czech has never been to World Cup before (not that i have known of), so it can be Greece as well. To round it all up, i tink Portugal would be definitely be in the finals. NBA is now over (at least i tink it is), but then u can't catch it live on Singapore TV as well. Super Bowl (NFL) is also over, so, well........   School starting soon  Yep, it's the day after tml. Nope, it's tml, because it's Sunday already (it's way psat 12am). I tried to end my "art" of sleeping late days ago, but to no avail. So tml nite will be a terrible nite for me, won't be able to sleep well. Our form teacher recently put up an announcement, she seems quite excited that school is starting soon. Having regrets are part of being human, well, i now really regret that i haven't put a productive use to the holidays nor have a really fruitful one. Reflections are always made to make one regret. Oh well...    Strive I must and achieve I will  It has indeed been very rocky for me the first part of this year. It has not been an eventful and pleasant one too. It has been scary to see how i have wasted my holidays juz like that, i have neither playstation nor xBox at home currently. So, i tink i muz write a notice reminding me to strive always and paste it on my computer screen. computer has been my greatest addiction. i now assure u that u will not see me online so often now. What's so gd abt coms? A question pondering me while i did my reflections. I juz wasted so much time on it. It is now hereby necessary to curb this unlawful activity and habit. Sigh, today has been also a very meaningful day. i juz handed over my computer games to my dad for the locking-up ceremony. maybe i will consider locking up the computer too. (password lock pls, not purchasing a giant lock as if the whole machine's gonna be purloined anytime) I also hereby promise that I will be much more serious this semester and not fool about being a joker all the time.   NDP tickets, any luck?  My family has applied for the NDP tickets. We got 2 applications, one from each of my parents. Until today, we are (take note of the tense) still frantically hoping for the best. maybe tml in sunday service, i will include it in my prayers! =D sunday services have been a great help to free me from boredom, although listening to the sermons at times can be so............. at least, go to the church, sing some Christian songs, pray to God, and clear your mind. You must broaden your mind!  1:1,  Professor Trelawney  Alrite, back to NDP. So we got 2 applications out of a few hundered thousand, all vying for the actual day parade. In my opinion, many ppl attend NDP so that they can get the free gifts. It has happened, juz last year, a few Chinese nationals (PRs of Singapore) went there, took the bags, and left. How worse can they get? Tis' a tribute to the nation, how disrespectful!    Conclusion  It's great and good as well to sleep late. Today, for my first time ever, i can still see quite a few ppl online at this time. Oh btw, another thing, it's also very warm at nite nowadays, so basically i'm now sharing some "leng" jokes with my siblings to cool off. Parents are ranting away, go to slp etc. This must be the first time they ever slept so early, btw. They also usually sleep at 2am. Having really late supper (2am) is also becoming popular.  Juz not too long ago, i had a really late visit to 7-11, with parents of course. Still quite a FEW ppl on the sidewalk, and some cars (mostly taxis), no trucks or pick-ups. As the place i live a lot of condominiums with security guards, so every now and then u can see guards having supper and taking a night stroll as well. At 7-11, u may be surprised to c it packed with ppl, sitting on stools eating instant noodles. Same situation for petrol stations (the marts). As it's Euro 2004 now, u can c ppl streaming in and out of a nearby pub. Even i was quite attracted by it and wanted to go in. There u go now, just received a call from my aunt, wanting a  little  chat with my mum (she dint comment, bet she's not really sleeping).    Okay gtg now, not to slp, but to play some card games with siblings.

      Well, it's abt 12 more hours from now to my competition. Allow me to reiterate a while, the competition is all about making a Chinese (yeah, chinese) website on Lee Kong Chian (李光前). Tml, we (2 of us) will have to stand in front of more than 100 ppl and present our website. Although far, but it seems very near to me, because you are going to waste abt 8 hrs later for sleeping, making time pass very fast indeed. A ex-6c of mine (anonymous), also took part in a english speaking competition and had his taste today. It's my turn tml, so ppl... wish me gd luck and cross ur fingers okay?

      Back to Singapore. Went to Bangkok the last few days (back for abt 2 days liao). This proved to be another interesting trip. Firstly, our flight (Air Asia, 12am flight) was delayed by 4 hrs. As it was the wee hrs, so we juz slept in the airport loh... Halfway thru's our slp, the security guards woke us up and questioned us. Funny... There have got to more than 10 other ppl slp around the same area, y they only questioned us? Have a 2-hr flight with very little stretching space, the seat cannot recline much, no breakfast etc...  This trip was planned in the first place was because my father needed to go there for some seminar. Now got Air Asia, so the rest of us juz went there and free & easy. Nothing much to c actually, all temples and there's a major jewellery store. The only thing i found very interesting was the "tutu" cars, three wheeled car-like scooters and opened-air. Can enjoy the smoke while riding along. Although it's cheap, but it always brought us to somewhere else first before bringing us to our destination. Had a hard time speaking english to them...  Another thing rather "interesting" happened while back at Changi airport. Now i'm questioning myself whether i looked too much like a kid? Now, after immigration clearance u must go thru' another security check. (customs) ppl were queueing up, and the metal detector had this sort of "traffic light" which tells u when to go thru' it. So it's my turn, then the police officer went, "Boy, u wait for the green man ah. Ah, like that hor, the red hand, don't go in. Wait for the green man to appear then u go in ah. Nah, go in go in, green man appear or-ready." That's not all. Unfortunatly, the metal detector beeped. So another police officer took the garnet thingy, and said, "Boy, keep still ah. don't move ah. okay very good, don't move ah." Come on, ppl, i'm big enough to noe these things already!!!

      Noticed something interesting on Yahoo!'s website today. Yahoo! now provide 100MB of storage. Also, with a stronger anti-spam system a fresh new look. (i'm a yahoo user) now i tink Hotmail is probably the worst email provider already. with only a stingy 2MB of storage. Now probably anyone would wanna join Hotmail is because of MSN Messenger. These 2 other choices would be much better than Hotmail itself, because of their email services: Gmail (Google, still under beta test, 1GB storage) and Yahoo! Mail. (100MB of storage now, more user-friendly)

      This must be the household joke of the year! Somehow, the plastic cover of our toilet, er... bowl had broken. So we took it out to repair it. Just before we were trying to screw it back, my father felt rather erm eccentric and took it to the kitchen basin to wash. Not only that, he was using the scrub we used for washing our dishes. My mum was really furious and hope that doesn't turn into domestic violence. (touchwood) My father was like, "what's wrong lah?"... Imagine having to eat using plates that are scrubbed with the brush once used for scrubing toilet bowls... Yikes!

      today met one of my schoolmate. we began telling "冷" jokes.  him: hey jensen！u here also ah? want to hear some jokes?  me (feeling damn sian, waiting for mum at cashier): okay loh...  him: there are ten birds. the hunter opened fire and hit one of them, y dint the other 9 birds fly away?  me: becoz their wings are injured?  him: wrong. becoz they are ostrich so they can't fly.  me: 冷...  him: 什么朋友不能交？  me: 坏朋友？  him: 错！猪朋狗友... u want to make friends with a pig and a dog meh?  me: ** shut up, and quietly left, feeling real cold...**  him: oi! 冷笑话也是有"art"的，okay?!   The art of “冷" jokes?! Well, norvin sure has some. (that guy is not Norvin lah, but norvin damn pro in telling lame things too...)   just days ago at the camp, one of the seniors told a damn lame joke.   There are once 2 bananas which had a race. After the first banana ran for a while, he felt hot and took out his outer covering, and then threw it in front of him. He then ran over his outer covering, slipped and fell to his death.   End of part I...  Years later, the son of the dead banana wanted to have a race again with another banana. The son learnt from his father's lesson, so this time he threw his outer covering behind him. Then after one lap, the son later then stepped on the outer covering and fall to his death too...  End...    What's so funny about this "joke"? 冷...

       A New Song Added  If you look carefully around this website, you may already found that i have added a embed for songs. For those of you who haven't found it, it's just below the disclaimer and copyright. The song i have chosen this time, is 牵引，from 邓妙华. Yes yes, i noe, old song it is. It's meant for enthusiasts for the good ole golden songs of the 80s like me =P. (yes i noe kit, u somehow have a strong liking for these kinds of songs) alrite, even if u dun appreciate it, just let ur dad or mum listen lah...   The Resolution thingy  Nope, it's not about new year resolutions or whatever. But some feedbacks to me have complained about the text being too large and thus making the blog uglier. well, is it? later then i found out that they are having 800x600 resolution. well, this blog is designed (or at least i think) on 1024x768 resolution. So, sorry, i really can't do much about it. Either bear with the ugly design of the blog, or change ur resolution. Anyway, thanks for your valuable feedbacks!   Nothing happened much over the weekend, so no topic to discuss. But be rest assured that i will find a topic to discuss next week!

      For those who have cried, begged or whatsoever for a new update, here it is! And now for those who have been wondering, i have been to a camp these few days, so no update.    Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  I have to quite agree with the critics, this film has not met its full potential. I don't think it's very good. Firstly, the new director Alfosno Cuaron has missed out quite a few main and important parts of the book. And also, the sequence of events are somewhat slightly changed and some facts of the book also changed. The plot is just sort of different from the book. Also, has Hogwarts a clock tower and the beautiful yard? Does it have the bridge or something? When does it have such beautiful scenery? Well, this is something for you to wonder. Now for the positive points. The visual effects are nice, and i especially like the Dementors! =)   The Amazing Race  During the camp, I played in the amazing race. Basically, we must run around the southern districts of singapore and complete lame tasks. During the trip, quite a few interesting things happened to share about.  1) If you are a regular passenger of the MRT, you may know this. Currently, every single second in every single MRT station owned by SMRT, you will hear this familiar song. "拜六礼拜，会不会开？”Familiar enough? Good.   2) In Orchard road, we were cornered by some ang moh entertainers, in conjunction with the Singapore Arts Festival. We were practically doing lame stuff with them, like smiling in front of a fake camera which often breaks down. I got a photo as souvenir, so for whoever who wants to see it, maybe next time when we have the chance.  3) In War Memorial Park, we had a task which requires us to tell a few lame jokes. It's qutie er... inconvinient to share them here, so maybe again next time when you meet me, or thru' MSN Messenger =D.   Alrite, i tink that's all that i have to say, or rather can say. Until next time, cheers.

      Sunday, a day of brightness and happiness. However, today is sure a dark and sad day.   President Reagan passed away  Ex-President Ronald Reagan, a "true American hero", passed away at 93. He passed away at 93 in California. President Reagan stopped the Cold War years ago. From a Democrat, he somehow changed into a Republican during his political days. Somehow, Reagan's life is partly alike to Arnold's (can't spell his surname) life. He was firstly an actor, then he entered politics and became governor of State of California.    Back to Singapore, Back to The World of Worries  I have basically no time at all to share my experiences in my trip. Maybe next time. Since the few hours i'm back in Singapore, new work and news from school were thrown at me. I have now bad news, and have extra work to do. Haiz, it's just a few days overseas to relax and i come back with everything thrown at me and new worries to come.

      Well, it has been days in New York and i'm fortunate enough now to get a chance to update a little.   So much significance...  This trip really had a lot of significance. Firstly, on arrival in New York JFK airport, something MAJOR happened. Somehow, United gave the wrong immigration form. They gave the white one, but Singapore is under visa-waiver so we should get the green form instead, We queued up for nearly 20 mintues before we reached the counter. There, the immigration officer went, "Hey pal! I think ya got the form all mixed up! Ya should take the green one instead over there." My father was already half-way scanning his forefinger (we thought we also needed to scan)... Well, we went back to the form-filling counter, only to realise that they have ran out of english forms. So we took a Chinese one while the rest are a mix of Japanese and Korean. Still, we passed that round. The officers were very strict, like so pissed with them. They like compare very carefully the photo in your passport and you yourself. They took out so much time that a Chinese tourist in front banged on the counter. Haiz... My mum was also so pissed that she waved her hand in front of the officer's face when he was checking her passport.   That's all for now. Will update more when i come back!

      This house is getting totally crazy! Not only there are mickey mouses everywhere. But my neighbour's dog Mickey also likes running about in our house now. (My neighbour and us have very good relationship, 100 times better than the Joo Chiat one) Not only that, my brother and my sister have suddenly caught on the "Mickey" trend and started the Mickey song and sing. My maid seemed to join in the trend also, singing along while washing the dishes in the kitchen. What the Mickey?!

      Today is again another lame day. (in fact, un-lame days at school are actually more or less numbered.) we went to the national stadium after our lessons, to cheer for our track & field team. i realy felt like sleeping, it's so boring and we were squeezed like lemons, the cool weather also added to the impressive conditions for napping. however, the weather got so cool that it actually poured, we had too much people to move into the shelter and of course i got drenched. it actually rained at 2 separate times, so this is the procedure: in, out, in and out again from the shelter. when the drizzle started to get heavier, i proceeded to get my umbrella. but the eccentric (and senile, no offense!) told us not to open umbrellas. what if i catch a cold, sue them and claim compensation? my whole bag was also dreched and my school materials were wet, and i'm really and seriously planning to ask for compensation as well. some of my exercise books are so wet that they can't be used any more. mum was of course really furious, said she would call the school authorities SOON. (how soon is soon?)  i stayed till the end of the prize-giving, throughout this time, i really envied those "escapists". and when we really started to leave, i followed the crowd and initially thought that i had gone the wrong way. so i went to geylang interchange and took another slooooowwwwwww bus, 985. it took me around 45 minutes, so i reached home at 9pm, wet and hungry...  oh, i forgot to mention the most important part. our school got double champ again this year!!! (1st for both c boys and b boys) however, hcjc's performance was quite abysmal. let's hope that tml we can get half-day...

      something lame i noticed today. bus no. 74 is not the bus with the highest frequency. today, i was sorta quite attracted to the bus-stop out of my bus window. guess what's the most frequent bus in singapore now? it's none other than 61, of our very own Toh Yi Estate and Hoover Park. How frequent is frequent? for 74, u r likely to get around 3 buses in 5 minutes. for 61, it's ONE BUS NEARLY EVERY MINUTE!!! and the bus are those SMRT Bendy buses, the long type. of course, this scenario can only be seen during peak hours, from around 5pm to 8pm. and now, guess the bus with the least frequency in singapore... that's right, it's again from our very own Toh Yi Estate and Hoover Park, 66... 66 still currently hold the record safely for the bus with the lowest frequency in singapore. so how slow is slow? 1 bus in 45 MINUTES. i really pity those from our school who lives in jurong east and can only take 66 back. wait for so long everyday...

      Yep, today's my birthday... i counted the no. of birthday gifts, fewer than last year. every year, birthday gifts and practical cards get lesser and lesser. This is so disappointing, as more and more are sending e-cards. nvm, make my "thank you"s eaiser to send. i just send a reply message or catch them on MSN. In the past, for not so close friends and relatives, had to call and thank them. for the rest, just say "thanks" the next time you meet. or rather, when that person gives u the gift in person, u thank him personally. with email and online techonology, it's so much easier. also, i feel that each birthday is becoming more and more unsignificant. i nearly dint get a birthday cake today...   LongHorn  I'm so frustrated with BitTorrent, i'm still downloading longhorn despite the fact that i started downloading on saturday night actually. it's still stuck at 10%, and my family's really too poor to let it run overnight. just wait loh... u must have the patience to succeed, in which this case it refers to the benefits (and the non-benefits) the LongHorn may bring to me. For those who don't know what's LongHorn in the first place, go to http://www.microsoft.com. aniwae, for others who are downloading, trust me, u can........ die from it. what is most fortunate is that i have strong pyschological stand in me, so i'm unaffected from it. do the breathing exercise when you are flared up. btw, sylvanus must have finished downloading by now...   Of MSN Messenger  A classmate of mine today (anonymous) had unleashed claims that MSN Messenger has more than 150 allocation places. He had 156 contacts. I don't understand whether i'm surprised or exhilarated upon hearing this piece of news in the first place. yep, i'm one of those "siao" ones who have reached the max. no. of MSN contacts. Often, when i want to add in new contacts, i would either have to delete someone else or just allow that person to be on my allow list. Just today, i have checked with several other fellow-chatters and they all confirmed that Hotmail had NOT recently reviewed its policy on this matter. sry to disappoint you all guys, but the max. no. of MSN contacts you can have REMAINS at 150. Maybe with the coming major changes and upgrading Hotmail is going to take soon, they should also review the allocation places for the no. of contacts in MSN. Since they can add more storage space to their emails, y can't they allow more contacts in the MSN Messenger? Or maybe Google implement GMessenger, with more contacts and faster and more stable connectivity.

      I really have to agree that IE (Internet Explorer) is the worst among the number of browsers available. Even with the new pop-up blocker feature, it basically still sux a lot.  1) Opera - The design of this browser is less than sleek (it's quite square-ish)and it carries ad banenr as well. good thing is it provides tabs which mean u can open many sites at one time without having many new windows appearing.  basically alrite, shows in you detail the downloading of the site (the progress, such as the current downloading speed etc.) basically, i would love to use this if some improvements are made. be careful, embed media players etc. will not work... with pop-up blocker and password remembring tool. downloading is faster than other browsers too. certain things may not be viewed too.  2) Mozilla - Nothing special. Looks like IE but it's a bit more stable and faster than IE. Includes pop-up blocker and password remembring tool. some problem may appear because of tabs.  3) Safari - I like this browser the most actually. it's the most reliable and the fastest. Too bad, it only works with Macintosh. It's fast in downloading applets too. anyway, don't try to download it to windows. it won't work. i liked the interface quite a lot, sleek design.   4) Netscape - Sleek design. love the interface. but nothing special. i dun tink it has pop-up blocker too. but there's still a password manager.

      Instead of today, let's talk about tomorrow now. So, tomorrow is basically a very slack day for me. I will only be taking the first 2 periods of the day and it's off to make the CNA video film. Glad to miss the other subjects, they are all the subjects i hate most. Tml just put up a good show and maybe we can get dismissed even earlier.    "Dumb" Quote of the Day  Quote of the day, "critcising ks can be really fun. you will never get the scandalous sensation of him cringing bitterly and revolting on your remarks, no matter how painful it may be. this is one of the most impressive features of ks, as he's one of the minority who doesn't revolt when someone's actually having on antagonistic remarks at you. everyone, treasure this priceless chance, so let's all start making fun of ks." well, here you go. i quite agree with this statement! ks is of highly venerated because of his impressive attitude towards people. keep up the work, ks!   Of New Computers  Yes, we are finally going to get a new computer. and yesterday, i found out how SOON is soon. it's about 1 year more. my father said "he needed to save money for this". haiz, waiting slowly... anyway, i can't download the new build of LongHorn because my com really cannot take it. was quite frustrated and i ended up having only installed the "LongHorn transformation tool" which can only change the APPEARANCE to LongHorn, but not the features...

      I hereby promise that i will TRY TO use proper english from now on so that i can improve my linguistic prowess or whatever you would call it. Really, i realized my language skills have deproved quite a lot lately, and i'm determined to revive it. i find myself speaking "unacceptable" english nowadays, really frustrated at it. somehow, i can speak certain mandarin or malay at the same time while speaking english halfway.    Chinese &amp; Such   Today met tangc. He seemed delighted as he was smiling the whole time while he was chatting with me. maybe and hopefully that it's something to do with our test results. we have done well in our tests, that's why he's so happy. still, i'm prepared for the announcement of my abysmal chinese results. anyway, today met his wife and 2 daughters in the auditorium. they were taking photos... getting apprehensive of the release of chinese results. i really want exemption from the chinese subject, as chinese usually requires a powerful memory, and it can be considered as quite a dead subject. as long as you study and memorize, u can pass with flying colors. but the problem with me is that i have a really bad memory and linguistic aspects of studying is not really my cup of tea.    Racial Harmony   Racial Harmony today was basically a farce. pupils from west spring sec came, and they were just another couple of darn brants. i heard certain chs guys are so despo that they are actualyl requesting for the tel. no. of the girls. today, i was also noticing the costumes of the teachers. miss wong (math) was wearing something that looked like a night-gown, tangc was wearing black all over, black shirt and pants, gohsj (music) was wearing something arabic, limcc (geog) and quah (eng.) nothing special. dint see teocm and kala today. so basically it was a boring day, we just lamed around and looking at exhibits. we were so desparate to be lame that we came out with lame quotes, like "it's lame to be lame" and "it's even lamer to be lamely lamer." our world today revolves around the word lame.    Currently...   it's even lamer now to be doing hw at this time. i still have a stack of math ws to complete. it's most annoying. rest of my family clapping alont with "the price is right" on cbs channel with bob barker. i tink this is a lame show and wondered how it has survived and persevere till today. yaya, the price money are enticing, but it's still basically a lame show. i tink it's something to do with the personal character and attitude of bob barker, the show was preserved till today. again now, listening to william hung's "inspiration" while delightfully and exhilaraingly completing my math ws. it's a invigorating source of energy, william hung's music. i especially like to listen to him sing YMCA, very forceful and energetic, with vigor and all... oh, i can feel my nose growing longer now...    Before ending my post, i would like to say that my blog has become a medium for me to shed any lameness in me. basically, i found some of the posts i have created rather lame. for my readers, just treat them as being "hilarious"... hahaha... now i c y ppl don't comment, i can't comment on my own posts!! OMG!!!

       Test  Today was Chinese test. the first few sections were alrite, i was getting confident enough, until i came to the last part, comprehension. i was really pissed with the passage, don't know half the time what it's talking aobut, it's about the story of some clone, about how humans are smarter, hehe... the questions basically sucked, and i have a feeling that it's the same answer for every answer the whole time. tangc basically was sorta surfing the net (can't see, i was sititng at the corner) for 2 whole periods we were doing the test. tangc don't look too happy recently...   Racial Harmony tml  tml is racial harmony day, so basically no lessons. the vip for tml is dr vivian bala krishnan. got the joke? no? nvm... aniwae, still dunno what to wear for tml...

       Blocks of Life  i do notice that ks have always positive results for his tests or exams or wadever. he nearly got all A1s... well, in my class, if u got A1, the teacher would be congratulating u quite a lot and people will be so awed with your results. one word to say it all, "incredible" to get all A1. My tests all nearly scrap either A2s or B3s. i admit that i wasn't really that conscientious in my studies, but at least i do revise before tests (few days beforehand) and pay my fullest attetion in class. even with this, scraping only A2s most of the time. and usually, i'm just that close, 1/2 mark or 1 mark, something like that. oh btw, getting nearly full marks (such as 26/30 OR 17/20) is really really really uncommon. for maths, we have highest marks like 35/40 (by a real maths pro) but the rest are averaging on 24/40. i got 28/40. haiz... it's just so that hard, the criterias make it difficult.   Chinese Test tml  yes yes, chinese test tml, and i'm studying "like siao" back home here. there will be as usual 10 questions on word application (without hanyu pinyin pls) and another 10 on "ci yu" application. then we will have 5 sentences to make and another 10 questions on chinese culture, like the story of 《列子》and must memorise how to write the names of characters like "九方皋" and "秦穆公". also, must remember "天干地支". let's see if i can get it right now. "jia yi bing ding wu ji geng xin ren gui, zi chou yin mao chen si wu wei shen you xu hai". sounds confusing? not really, this are just some of the requirements. and then there will be something from our ke ben as well, just read them hard enough.  gtg, must really drill from now on, or else won't pass tml. serious, a lot of people fail tests.

      Played SimCity 4 today and yesterdy. quite fed up with it actually, it's all so slow and laggy. i'm extremely certain that it's due to my slow com (501mhz). still can't blame it, we are really really poor, just wait until my com gets upgraded. just wait patiently, one must show patience and determination to achieve...   Horn It  ks has got LongHorn. he's downloading it now and he's blocking me as "i'm distrupting the downloading of the software". horn it! i'm so jealous, my computer is too slow for longhorn and my virtual pc basically can't run well.   Free Tuition Class  Actually, composing every post in blogs are not easy and they are sure good for your development and polishing of writing skills. i recommend keeping blogs for those with low comprehension and composition skills. you may just improve, serious...

      Today, somehow i got wind of something of grave importance. someone in our school is gonna face grave punishment because he [or she =)] is defaming a certain teacher in our school. next time, i will&nbsp;try not, oh not try, never&nbsp;to talk about teachers in my blog anymore. too risky, really. wonder how the teachers found the blogs of students. for students, i strongly recommend that you don't tell the address of your blog to any of your teachers. (ex-teachers (primary school) maybe alrite, they can't punish you and they can't expel you you too). i dunno whether it's true, but it's said that this guy is gonna face expulsion... be careful and warned, this is a very realistic world. even though you may not be from chinese high, but... this is still a realistic singapore. it's just defaming...  &nbsp;  oh btw, notice that certain elements in this blog has been either edited or removed so that i won't touch on sensitive issues about teachers. really freaked out now.  &nbsp;  PS.

      Saw this interesting article in ks's blog...     Casuarine and I were in the same room - room 1. Room 1 is also known as the most dreaded place any interviewee ever wanted to go. It consisted of 3 EXCO (Executive Commitee) members - with the president Kegan!!! The questions they asked are all crap - and tough. Really tough. So tough that I didn't even expect them to come up with some "jian" questions like that. One example: If you had to organize a meeting for a project (and you have 9 members). 4 suddenly cannot come. Would you still continue with the meeting or would you cancel it? Provide reasons.  If i were you, ks, i would simply reply this... "Casuarine and I were in the same room - room 1.

I have&nbsp;performed badly for certain assignments, and i have a feeling that i won't do that well for tests this term. this weekend, luckily no much commitments so i have time to study well for chinese test. this term got a segement for appreciation of chinese culture, they will ask something like "tian xia zhi ma", "tian gan di zhi" and something else from our "ke ben",&nbsp; like who is the writer for this particular "story" etc. omg, have to memorise the names of the writers and learn how to write them as well. i must really do well for this chinese test, or my mean grade this term will swoop and plunge down.

      Today's fever reached 38.5 degrees, but i muz still admit that i'm still perfectly in a good mood and energetic. There are 2 possibilities for today's fever:  1) Today we played basketball in the rain. and i'm not perfectly well from the last fever. so there comes another round of fever. strange, because my fever sorta started after the pe lesson.  2) the chocolates ms teo gave me were poisoned. and she finally rmb my name, "jensen, come over pls". anyway, she's not realy that evil and she's really really really nice when she's in a good mood. i'm not biased towards her, but somehow i don't like her a lot. i must try to adapt... she's at least better than kala... today at ms teo's table, saw a photo of his son and husband. she's married alrite...   currently, talking to yinghan (my ep3 senior) rite now. he's asking me questions about groups now. suspect that he's trying to kick me out of his group...

      Today is the semi-finals. I must say that we did unmistakably quite well. If we are accompanied by some strokes of luck, we may just get into the finals! =D Wow, dream along, dream along... Aniwae, i just tink that we muz really change our project title. we are getting the analysis for the whole subject but not the particular aspect and angle we are supposed to be focused on.    Of buses   Nowadays, the frequency of 66 has increased, good job, sbs. y? becoz 66 is always the first bus that comes when i step out of the school gate. During this period from 3pm to 7.30pm, that damn path  inside  the bus would clog up. These people are unmistakably from Little India. I don't mean to be racist, but, boy, u can really get the aroma floating around inside the bus. Also, with so many people, i have to stand up all the time. This is the part i hate most, the MAD DRIVERS of 66. There was one time i nearly fall on the driver himself. luckily i held on to a metal bar on time. or some drastic accident may happen.    Of teachers   Quah is feeling "lovely" lately. she wanted us to write some love story, and mark her words, she said she will read all 35 stories of everyone to the whole class. imagine her reading some mushy stuff to the whole class and mr. hon walks by, good contrast... What's worse? she created the whole setting for us that it sounds more like some love stories in ancient china. the male counterpart is called "fu gui", and the female one is called "ru hui". "fu gui ru hua", appearing in some place like Chinese Garden, drinking chinese tea in one of the pavillions by the lake, OMG!!! how romantic... alrite, back to the topic, teocm is in EXTRA good mood lately, she's all chirpy in class and as emotional as ever. Oh, did i mention be4, she's the discipline mistress of sec 2. oh well...

       Project's Day and MRP  MRP and Project's Day are a complete waste time. They keep us really busy, but do the students really put good productive use to it? Why don't they just organize overseas field trips? Like last year December, they go to Havard in Boston. Along the way, they stopped in New York and tour, have a good look at the famous New Yorkish fire-engines. Also went to Ground Zero, Time Square, Grand Central and Empire State. Imagine myself in the Western US pulling slot machines while my teacher-to-be at that time is (December 2003) at the East side. Wow... Alrite, back to the topic. Project's Day is tml, so i'm getting the jitters right now. So May God Bless Me. Stay tuned to my blog for the results.   Hotmail is degrading  Hotmail recently is very problematic. Firstly, the whole inbox website is full of pics. lately, download is extremely slow and i'm very tired all the time waiting for the pics to load finish. Next, there are more advertisements as usual, maybe it's just after Independence Day or something like that. These ads have none of my concern at all. Some are about "mortgage rates are the lowest in 40 years", some about some dingy "state farm car insurance" and "all state insurance", some about "love.com, meet ur new love" and some about "Nevadan state reserve has increased loan rates blah blah blah"...These advertisements are very tiring when the inbox is loading so slowly. damn u, hotmail, improve ur services. or i will switch to gmail, forever...   Comments  Lately, there are no comments for my posts. wondering y, maybe because so busy for everyone these few weeks, and i also dint advertise much lately. dunno lah, tests are starting next week liao, even more busy. after term 3, it's back to skool at term 4 and it's final exams straight away liao. after that, real peace and enjoyment is found... aww...

      Oh gosh, alvin tan criticised the project's website today!!!!! Firstly, "the color does not make a good enough contrast". Then he suggested having the customary black and white again. That is just so uncreative and unoriginal. Secondly, "the words are too small". It should be the customary font size 24 again. Ours was much smaller. He was very worried that the judges won't be able to see our words, so he told us to do a ppt instead. Imagine tml, we are the only team presenting in ppt. OMG!!! Then the audience will ask, why are you using a ppt when you should be introducing your website? die die. aniwae, ks, don't despair. i understand that it's not your fault.

       Fun Day  Yesterday was a tough day. In the morning, we went to BTPS Fun Day, which really wasn't very fun at all. It's meant for those P1 rascals, for them to jumped on the inflated balloons, for them to play some stupid games. Met Mdm Wang (tour guide for the day) and Mrs Lee. Poor Mrs Lee, she's so thin now. Mdm Wang looks the same. Aniwae, Mrs Lee got some heart problems, and she juz took 3 days MC recently. She dint took a day of MC when she taught us...   Project's Day  Yesterday, Ivan, Reuben and ks came to help in the Project's Day. ks designed the website nicely, with a very smooth feeling etc. That was one of the best website ever created, i feel that it's even better than our "Lee Kong Chian" website as it's more user-friendly. I'm certainly proud of that website. So, we worked till about 8.30pm, then ks went home. btw, ivan and ks had a sumptous dinner at my hse, i'm a very good host. they also had air-conditioner to ensure a soothing environment for them to work in. So we completed most of the website by 10 pm. So, for relaxation, watched "Good Morning America" on ABC channel. After that at 11pm, watched "Price is right" on CBS channel. 12am, watched Judge Judy. At 1am, the "OC". After that, it's sleep.

      Found this statement from the blog of my senior (translated from mandarin): "The moon has been especially round and bright lately. On the lunar calendar 16th, it's also July 4th. That is America's Independence Day. Long ago, the ppl made a mistake. That is to let the americans form america."  awww, really hurts my national pride. there's nationalism and americalism in me. sigh, if america was nvr formed. maybe i'm still somewhere in china, living in a village somewhere in teochew.

      Life is getting busy with Moron's Retarded Paper (MRP) and Project Work. So here's a quick and short update finally.   The Crazy Bus Service  Lately, i often take service 66 back home from school. service 66 has this bunch of MAD DRIVERS. most of the time unfortunately enough i'm standing. service 66 then keep accerlerating and slowing down. then, when it finally S.T.O.P., there are 2 possibilities. a) u fall down on the ground and break your bone. b) u find yourself performing some aerobic stunt like stretching to the back touching the ground, and a sudden excruciating pain in your stomach. with ur heavy bag on your back at all times.  juz today, the driver was tapping his fingers on the horn (in the steering wheel) while driving with 1 hand. i dunno whether it's the same driver all the time, yesterday i took the bus at a different time, so... i dunno lah.   Of Songs  I'm going to change the song weekly in my blog, or whenever i like it. sry to chinese song fans out there, but i HATE chinese songs actually. so only english songs, or occasionally tamil lah. reason y i hate chinese song, and they seem or rather "hear" so "nice" all the time? if i'm not wrong, i have about 1/4 ang moh blood in me and this is the part of my boiling blood that triggers off the hatred. really, i'm not lying, i just checked out my mother's family tree to make sure.  That's all now. have something to blame ks, he dint say thank you nor even mention me in his latest entry. one part of the entry actually concerns me, i made him found his happiness.

      There seems to be something wrong with every blogger's blog. How annoying and frustrating, when when "cannot find server" page keeps coming out. blogger is starting to get unreliable too.   It's just too bad  i hate to say that i did not get thee ndp tickets. how annoying. juz give me the tickets what. oh well... it's impossible to negotiate now. they are already giving out the tickets.   Homework  juz recovered from fever and my brain is still feeble. how annoying, to see a 6 feet stack of homework lying cheerfully on my desk. luckily tml no school, or i won't be able to complete them. argggggggh. have to work my feeble mind on these sheets of paper. purely paper. oh well.  anyway, happy youth's day and happy fourth july to all.

Added another link in just 1 day. seem like all my classmates finally started to create blogs. so, check out the "bloggers" section of the menu on your right.  (basically, qi han, if u r reading this, i'm actually making it easier for you to check out blogs of your classmates.)

      Today went to WestMere (a condo which i suspect where 1 of my EP3 seniors live) as usual on a weekly basis. However, today was especially memorable. i got chided by the idiotic security guard for no reason. i was wearing sandals and running (more of brisk walking) about the pool area, not even stepping on the water. then this security guard came and chided for "running around the pool area with shoes on". Hey, ur condo is so small that u got to pass by the pool whenever u want to cross from block to block! If u want to scold me for running around the pool and it's very dangerous, it's more acceptable. but i wasn't even running, i was only brisk walking...   tot i saw my ep3 senior the last time in westmere (he did not see me). so today went looking for him. dun tink he's home though. oh well, nvm... sorta shadowed him the last time, so now know where he lives.

       WE FOUND MS TEO'S PASSWORD!!!  Don't think i should really post such stuff on the web, but... The whole class actually found ms teo's password to her CHS website. There's this section "History" which requires password for entry. Incidentally, we found her password. not only her, but the passwords of several other teachers as well. but aniwae, i tink that "History" section is meant for students as all the notes are inside. so maybe, she used to tell her students the password last time...   National Day Celebrations  Today is a slack day for us. The celebrations ended at around 9.30am. Ex-classmates of last year were initiating to go back to primary school. but since i went back during fun day 2 weeks ago, don't feel like it... In the end, none of us really went. So i rushed home, can start playing my Final Fantasy. However, there are 3 term tests next week. So really must buck up, study well during the 4-day holidays. yes, i got some stupid hw (algebra and geometry, the most sianz topic of all). but don't feel like doing it today, only wanna play... Really must study hard for history, my worst subject. i barely passed last term.    Gifts & Such  ks wanted Sims2, so planning to get for him (pirated?). in exchange, i want (take note of the tense) Harry Potter 3 (PC game) and Final Fantasy XII, which is due next year. I don't mind pirated stuff honestly, pirated final fantasy can be really nice also. but for harry potter, REALLY REALLY have to buy original version, graphics of pirated version really suck.

      It's so annoying yesterday. Apparently, we were made to give a speech during our Chinese lesson. So yesterday, it was my turn to give the speech. I basically screwed up everything and it's yet another farce. Just when i was speaking halfway, certain people started laughing and making fun of me, especially the guy in front (anonymous). I tried to evade his "making fun" of me and looked at the back of the class, and unfortunately they were laughing too. I'm the type who can laugh easily, so i started giggling and chuckling halfway throughout my speech. In the end, i got 6+7+9=22 marks, which would have been 8+8+9=24 if i did not laugh... feel so betrayed and "sabo-ed".   Sabbaticals  This morning, we thought the registration for the sab. was already opened, so the whole class was fighting over the com. we all tot we had already registered, when we found that the registration site was only a demo. felt so pissed. at around 1pm, the registration really opened. by the time i got the chance to register, only the below-par courses are left. ended up joining some chinese thing, and had to pay $55 for it. later found out that my ep3 (or rather CCA) actually urged us to join that particular course.   Teachers... again...  Quah is recently in extra good mood. just today, she gave me (and some few others) a box of Oreo cookies. then, we later played a prank during class on En Hao, the all-time notorious trouble-maker of our class hated by all teachers. En Hao basically loves coming to lessons late. Like on Wednesday, he's always late for English lessons as he can't be bothered to run from the com lab (be4 eng, we were having com). So today, we secretly scheduled our class in the library, en hao was the only one who doesn't know about it. then after com lesson, we all urged en hao to run back quickly for class, and HE REALLY DID, and he ran back to the classroom instead! quah was like laughing aloud with us throughout the lesson. of course, later he was sent to the library as well. oh btw, quah is the one who set the lit term test. and, if it's ms kala, i bet en hao won't be strolling back to class so frequently.  teocm is not in a good mood nowadays. she's been quite "un-nice" this week. just today, she instructed 2 guys in our class (those who did not finish hw) to go with her to her afternoon lessons, in 3K. However, she's still quite fun in class. I really hope she will teach us again next year.

      Seniors are beginning to know my blog too. At first, i only allowed close friends and relatvies to know about it. Now, it's sorta all screwed up. have to be really careful about what i blog now, or some adverse side-effects may happen. yi kun can be really a good specimen.    National Day  Singapore's National Day (August 9th) is approaching. Quite unsignificant to me, but i'm looking forward to the holiday. This time, including weekends, it's a total of 4 days. So, sit back, relax and enjoy the holidays. Malaysian scholars can use this opportunity to go back to Malaysia. IF only we are rich enough, we can use this opportunity to fly back to LA too. We can spend about 48 hrs to get the USA summer feeling. Since Singaporeans are busy singing national songs (such as Count On Me Singapore) this also reminds me of a song, Back In The USA by Chuck Berry. Liked the song quite a lot.   Tests  Once again, tests are starting. So it's time to study again. Hate tests, and we still have final exams at the end of the year. but luckily, next week we are taking Year 1 Geography, History and English Literature for the last time. With the MRP, there are no final exams for these subjects. On the whole is quite "shuang", dunnit to study, haha. But I'm worried about History and Geography. History we haven't really done revision, we still can't even finish the textbook. For geography, our past class tests have really been too easy and "low-standard", when i took a peek at the geog. test papers of other consortiums, got a big shock. This type of questions really need the application, not only memorizing.
