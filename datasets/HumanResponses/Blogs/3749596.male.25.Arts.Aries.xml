      Dear God.  Alfred Hitchcock was once asked what he thought of a movie just after he'd seen it.  He said "You should never even talk about a film if you've only seen it once."  I will break that rule here for a brief moment and say that Spiderman 2 really really got my rocks off.  I'm encouraged over and over again by excellent storytelling showing up in moves that could entirely rest on the laurels of insane special effects.   urlLink Blade: Trinity  will not be as good, but I will see it anyways.  Wesley is my drrty.  My pal  urlLink Cowboy Monkey  directed everyone's attention to  urlLink this alternate source of white rapper vitamins.   I am more than happy to second this nomination.  I can't get enough of that fucking video.  My pops is supposed to get me pictures of a painting by  urlLink da Silva  that my family owns - its an oil on canvas original and its enormous. He hasn't sent them yet, so that means he's either dragging his feet or  urlLink he's busy .   I guess he could be busy.  As for Boston movie-goers, I should be more correct and say REVERE movie goers - you guys are a little rowdy.  As a sign of my infinite patience I will allow you another chance to prove yourselves as competent viewing audiences sometime this weekend.  I will not tell you when, however, as that would allow you to stack the audience with people from Brookline, or anywhere else.

      The link shows you where we live in Malden, MA.  Its a small suburb of Boston, a bit to the north.  As you can see by the ridiculous, non-gridded layout of our little bit of New England, Boston is really hard to get around.  For a long time, the story I heard about why Boston's layout was so random and evil was because of cattle-grazing in the bad old days: townships would set up fields for their citizen's cows to graze in, fence them off with deference to the lay of the land, hills, valleys, and whatnot, and then industry came around and built cities where the pastures used to be.  Upon doing more research about Boston, I discovered that this was not entirely true.  What actually happened was that people moving to Massachusetts from overseas would just put their houses wherever they wanted when they got here, without any mind to streets or city planning.  And so, in the year 2004, streetlights predict and direct angles of driving which are impossible to calculate and for some reason, streets change names and designations 8 times across 10 blocks of length, and there are no street signs telling you where you are when you need them.  And by "when you need them" I mean "when you are attempting to drive someplace only 3 miles away".     MOVE-IN STATUS     The movers showed up on Saturday.  Because Malden apparently has no concern for the legal height of 13'6" for powerlines, the moving truck couldn't get down my street without pulling all of the powerlines down.  Cost to me: $384.45   Kitchen unpacked. Casualties: LCD display on the front of the microwave   Bedroom unpacked. Casualties: None.   Kitties: way happier now that, like Mom and Dad, they have stuff to sleep on as opposed to Boston's regular cold, hard wooden floors.   Things still needed: For my new potential client to call me back, a desk for Diana's computer, and a bookcase for our previously-unknown-to-be really wicked huge amount of books.

      So the Gay Marriage Ban Amendment to the Constitution of the United States entered discussion phase in the Senate Friday.  Being totally fine with the idea of gay marriage, and not wanting to generalize, I became curious as to what arguments against gay marriage have actually lasted long enough to be kicked around on our great nation's legislative floor.  What I found was surprising!   Well, not really surprising at all.    In  urlLink Baehr vs. Miike (Hawaii, First Circuit Court, 1996)  many of the same arguments the Bombs-And-Jesus crowd are slathering about on Capitol Hill were made by the Director of Hawaii's Department of Health.  In short he denied them marriage licenses not based on law but for the following reasons, which I will shred like  urlLink Gator  in part and parcel:    Marriage == an institution between one man and one woman.   Okay, so unfortunately someone let a law get passed recently,  urlLink a Federal Law , that uses this language. This law defines the words "spouse" and "marriage" for the purposes of Federal law as thus:   Section 7.  Definition of 'marriage' and 'spouse' "In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling,  regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and  agencies of the United States, the word 'marriage' means only a legal  union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word  'spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or  a wife.   According to this law, so long as we call it by some other name, and the newlydudes don't refer to each other as "spouse" in legal documents, everything should be fine, right? They'll get all the same bonuses and penalties for being married, and that would be okay with everybody?  Suppose that one or two words were changed in this document - say "marriage" was suddenly defined as "a union between one Jewish woman and one red-haired man, or one left-handed woman and one punk-rocker man."   Or, even better, how about this: "a union between one Democrat and one Republican of the opposite sex."  I know what you're saying, you're saying "That's totally arbitrary!  Also, what if the Republican man can't find any Democrat women he likes?"  Well, what if, indeed?  I guess he could simply stop being Republican, change the way he's built, and become someone entirely different with totally different viewpoints and opinions and ideas, so that he finds the Democratic woman more palatable!  Sounds terrible, doesn't it?  How could you ask that of someone?!  Well how in the hell can you expect homosexuals to do the same thing?   I'm appalled that a bill like this would even get onto the floor.  And compared to what the GOP is after currently, this doesn't even seem that bad.  It pains me to remember that Clinton was in the White House while this bill was passed.  Many shadowy legislative ninjas refer to this law as a "victory for state's rights" which in a circuitous way it is and isn't.  Sure, Texas doesn't have to legitimize anything Massachusetts does, but also, by the way, here is how marriage is legally defined as told to you by the Beasts On High.  Its bears the distinction of being supportive and destructive to both a central governing power and what I like to refer to as "States that get the vapors".    Marriage is for procreation.   Oh, shit.  Really?  They better come and get my wedding ring, then.   urlLink A short look at this will inform you  that there's 1 single parent for every 100 people in the United States. Total, not out of parents or adults, but 1 in 100 out of the total population. Also, plenty of teenagers are getting knocked up and pumping out units without being married!  Shouldn't these people all be machine-gunned or something?  They are eating up the benefits of marriage without bearing the religious responsibility, what Bush ponders as the weighty cornerstone of civilization, and obviously should be shaved and painted like savages.    Same-sex couples aren't the optimum environment in which to raise children.   The punchline here is that most average households in America aren't the optimum environment in which to raise children.  I can't tell you how many good, Christian, upstanding citizens let their 2 year olds run around with a 2-liter and a bag of Cheetos.  Or how many regular church-goers I know get drunk and punch up on their kids like Subway Frequent Eater tickets.   urlLink Hetero People that hold true to the American Family Values Religiomatic Platform  TM   in their hearts are sometimes also bad parents!  Imagine how scandalized!   I'm not saying that only Christians beat their kids or refuse and fail to parent them.  I'm saying that most people mistreat their kids.  The three kids I know with gay parents at home are in better shape, are more respectful, and are far more bright than any of these hetereo-raised future tax payers.  And no, they aren't all tiny gay babies or pre-teens.  Oh, and PS, the 12-year old girl raised by the Gaymos certainly doesn't dress like the gutter trash hetero-produced tweens I see at the mall.   urlLink Have you seen   urlLink some of the shit   urlLink kids are wearing these days ?  You're lucky I couldn't figure out who sells the high-heel hooker boots to little girls, or else I'd have a link to that as well.    Gay relationships are immoral, and the sanctity of our awesome American family values must be protected!    We here in the US fight the good fight for the sanctity of marriage and our family values!  In fact, we fight so hard, urlLink  the United States pwnz other countries in the divorce rate category .  This argument is supported only by the moral constructionism found in Judeo-Christian religious beliefs, which have no place in a legislative argument.  There are multiple provsions in the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights that provide protection from religious persecution; that's how this country was started.    urlLink MC Bush spun up in his bumpin' radio broadcast  this pearl:   If courts create their own arbitrary definition of marriage as a mere legal contract and cut marriage off from its cultural, religious and natural roots, then the meaning of marriage is lost, and the institution is weakened.  Arguments against:   Any man-made definition of an intangible concept (like marriage, for example) is arbitrary.  The only explicit power the United States Government has ever had concerning marriage is as a mere legal contract.  Church and State are supposed to be strictly forbidden from intermingling, even though it is quite obvious that Jesus built the Bush Election Hot Rod.    The concept of marriage in the world's oldest religions and cultures contains ideas most White Judeo-Christian Taxpaying Weasels would scarcely be able to contain their lunch at.  Multiple wives, savage circumcision, funeral pyres, bridal burning - these are the cultural and religious roots of marriage, you fool.  Christians and some of their more archaic moral ideals are both a chronological and populist minority.    Marriage has no natural roots.  It is largely symbolic and has tax definitions.  That's about it.  The meaning of marriage is a largely personal thing.  To some it is a lifelong promise of something like romantic team loyalty and good sportsmanship.  For others it is a political licensure to appear normal and square.  For some it means nothing at all but obligation.  The institution and meaning of marriage are only as strong and sharply defined as the participants commit to making them.  I know some animals who only got married so they could go to swinger parties.   Listen, I don't want to slam anybody's religion.  Seriously, we all need something to believe in, and I'm not going to tell you that what you want to believe in is wrong.  What DOES happen to be wrong is any sort of religious involvement or participation in our government at any level.  The separation of Church and State is clearly defined and is there for a deluge of really, really good reasons.    Marriages are for ensuring the continuation of the species.    Saying this is equivalent to saying that people who get married and don't have kids threaten the very institution of marriage.  Again, this goes back to the procreation argument.  There was no "must hump" clause in my marriage license.    Marriage is traditionally a heterosexual institution.    Talking about tradition in America is asking for trouble from smartasses like me who pay even a cursory amount of attention to history.  The widespread murder of Indians, the burning of women at the stake for witchcraft, the total disregard of care for the environment, slavery, segregation - all traditional American institutions.  Obviously, in most cases, heterosexual marriage isn't quite as terrible as these things, and  urlLink some people, like John Ashcroft, seem to think things like slave states weren't all that bad.   This argument is totally silly.  It also used to be a tradition to spit in your hand before you shook on a deal or to marry your brother's wife if he died. I'm not even going to talk about this anymore.      Same-sex marriage is an untried social experiment.    So was colonial rebellion against Great Britain.  Also see letting women vote, letting blacks use the same bathroom as whites, and disco.  We're batting .750.   Gay marriage has been legal in Denmark since 1989.   urlLink Many studies  have been done in Europe about divorce rates, marital fidelity and general differences between gay and straight marriages in this nation that has no problem with men getting married to men, women to women, etc.  They have overwhelmingly found that gay couples get married after being together longer, are older at the time of marriage, and stay together much more than hetero couples.  They are also happier in general.  The adultery rates are far lower.   This might come as a surprise to many of you in the God Hates Fags crowd, but when they legalized gay marriage in Denmark, the moral fiber of the nation did not destroy itself, there wasn't anarchy in the streets, and no one has applied to marry their dog.  Also, and I understand this is a fear for many of you, but rest assured that no heterosexuals were forced to marry homosexually.  It is nice to know.  This argument comes from religious figures most of the time, and that isn't surprising.  Just referring to allowing gays to have the same rights as straight people as a "social experiment" sickens me, and it should sicken anyone with any sense of decency.  These people should be tied into sacks and thrown in the river like runty puppies.    Same-sex marriage would start us down a "slippery slope" towards legalized incest, bestial marriage, polygamy and all kinds of other horrible consequences.   As I just stated, none of these things have happened in Denmark.  In fact, Denmark joined Bush's  urlLink Coalition Of The Willing  and helped him carry the flaming sword to the Axis of Evil.  Lets consider this.  Terrorists are, in Bush's own words, enemies of everything we hold dear and civilization itself.  Also, gay marriage will unravel civilization.  Denmark allows gay marriage.  Hence,  DENMARK IS A TERRORIST STATE.  THEY HARBOR IDEALS THAT GO AGAINST THE VERY NATURE OF AMERICAN LIFE.   God knows I'm writing a letter as soon as I finish this piece.  They're fucking terrorists, man.  Obviously we can't consort with them anymore, because they will send us down a slippery slope where all men will be lined up like circus seals!  WE WILL ALL PLAY THE RUSTY TROMBONE AND FUCK OUR SISTERS AND CATS IF WE CONTINUE TO CONSORT WITH THE DIRTY DENMARKIACKS.    Granting gays the right to marry is a "special" right.      I still think forced integration was a mistake. As a government action, I think it was detrimental to whites and blacks. And left alone, it'd have come along -- if you look at the football teams in North Carolina, I tell you, there's scarcely any room for a white boy on 'em!"   -  urlLink Sen. Jesse Helms, December 2, 2002  Straight people can get married. Gay people can't.  Both are humans and as thus are equal in the eyes of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights.  Treating them like second class citizens is no better than saying something like "Uppity Negroes have no right to touch our white women. Or vote."  You silly Cro-Magnon prosophobes.    Sodomy is illegal.   If I could throw every sodomite in jail, I would be the first in line to serve my time.  And it would be a very,  very  long line.  Guess what, hetero nation!  Sodomy isn't just the buttsex between two men.  It is also any sort of oral or anal copulation at all, even between men AND women.  So, if gay people can't get married because of the possibility that they will sodomize each other (which, as a side note, is legislation based upon a potentiality, a lawmaking concept that no one in their right mind would agree to) then the logic stands that anyone who may sodomize each other can't get married at all.  So that means no more marriage.  And no more blow jobs.  And no more investigating the little man in the boat, if you know what I mean.  Although I guess people with no mouths or assholes could get married.  So there you have it.  No marriage for anyone that has a mouth or an asshole, and especially no marriage for anyone who has both.    Terrific Conclusion To This Awesome Report   To sum up, if gay people can get married they aren't going to force you or your kids to have sex with dogs.  Denying them the right to marry is treating them as inferior beings, lesser than their heterosexual counterparts.  All they want is the same rights that straight people have, and there is no good reason, legal or otherwise, that they should not have these rights.  All people in America supposedly have identical rights and opportunities.  I know this is bullshit, and you know this is bullshit, but we're talking about class warriorism when we say that, separating the wolves from the herd.  In the American lexicon of history, we have always been a self-correcting organism, always eventually recognizing our gross impropriety and fixing our blind, frantic mistakes to some extent or another.  The only problem with our current situation is that the blind, panicked animal has the reigns - this time McCarthy sits in the West Wing and shakes his self-righteous fist from a position that seems politically invincible to self-inflicted damage he shouldn't be able to withstand but somehow is.  It is unfortunate.    Nixon was crucified for less than this.

      Oh, its been a busy day.     President Bush declines invitation to speak at NAACP's annual convention  - Citing schedule conflicts, the White House turned down the NAACP's invitation for the 4th year in a row.  Bush accepted the invitation in 2000 when he was running for President;  with this year's refusal he becomes the first sitting President to not attend an NAACP convention since Herbert Hoover.  Come on George, the black vote isn't an entirely lost cause. Besides, there are a bunch of really rich blacks who have benefited MEGA-LARGE from your tax cuts.

      Okay, I don't have much time today, but I wanted to give you a few updates on some of the stories we've talked about.   Libya, Chad, Darfur, and the Sweathogs:   urlLink BBC NEWS | Africa | Libya to open Darfur aid corridor    Your taxdollars at work in Foreign Countries:  This is an interesting series of stories.     urlLink First, we read about how the House approved a budget bill  for sending aid to foreign countries. This bill set aside an amount that was half what Bush wanted spend of our money.  Then we see that Republicans in the House as well as the Bush administration won a victory by way of  urlLink an amendment to this same bill  that withholds aid to any country that might try and prosecute any agent or representative of the United States for war crimes or human rights violations. (This includes soldiers.)  Then we see that the  urlLink Bush administration took a huge blow in a  bi-partisan amendment , again to this same bill, to withhold aid from Saudi Arabia for generally being bad, shady guys.  Three victories for three disparate parties in one bill.  Who knew government could be so much fun?    The Senate will rip this thing to shreds, I imagine.

      The Republicans in the Senate could not get their act together this week to ban gay marriage. They needed a simple majority to proceed with it and 60 to send it to the states. Because of quarrels over language  within their own ranks  they got destroyed, more or less. Yeah, 48 - 50 doesn't seem so bad, but its worse than it looks.   The big picture guys will tell you that the whole point of this silly business was to get Kerry and Edwards to have to vote against the amendment, which both of them said publicly they did not support. Doing so would have instantly alienated them from a middling chunk of the electorate who may or may not have voted for them in November. See, with large chunks of the voting public, Bush pushing the amendment isn't enough for them to vote for him, and Kerry / Edwards  saying  they would vote against isn't enough for them to vote against Kerry and Edwards, but Kerry and Edwards  actually, really voting against it  would have been going too far, at which point they would cast their vote Party Ugg Two-Legs. People are funny, but voters like this are a real, actionable chunk of the voting public. People like this are why campaign managers sometimes set themselves on fire and then jump out a window.   So the Republicans had a plan to further divide the voters with this windmill of an issue - it is not only mean and regressive but also just about the least important of all the issues facing us as an electing body. It worked out rather well though, because by failing to agree on language from the get-go, the Republicans failed to garner even a simple majority (a majority which they have be default in the Senate, mind) and thus Kerry and Edwards were not required to vote for the measure to be defeated. Sure, some Democrat voters have been saying that they wished John/John would man up a little bit, but they were going to vote for him anyways and still will. Their avoidance of the vote was the only politically smart choice, and you people should realize you have a couple of shrewd dealers on your hands.   The importance of this, the signifigance of this public flogging of the Republicans, is that it displays even more weakness in a campaign that's already bleeding out. Bush's policies are apparently so unpalatable he can't get a simple majority for a sponsored measure in a Senate his party controls. Soon they will all be sitting on the curb, shoulders slumped, saying "If only this or this had happened" and thinking that they'll get 'em next year. Like most good ballplayers they won't blame the coach, which is good because every senator that signed his or her name to that resolution is like a pitcher who somehow makes it to the major leagues despite having the idea that their job is to hit batters in the face with fastballs as often as possible. Yes, both this and your actual job involve throwing a ball, but one way is correct and the other way will get you fired, will ruin your stats, and will most likely end up with a clubbing of some sort.

      Remember last month when  urlLink the United States resumed diplomatic relations with Libya?  They promised to dismantle all their WMD programs and stop harboring terrorists, and we said that we would lift sanctions and start making the nice with them again.  In April the sanctions were lifted and on 28 June diplomatic ties were re-established.   urlLink Just 18 days earlier , a story broke concerning Libya's plot to take out Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah.  Assistant Secretary of State William J. Burns, before deciding to renew the direct diplomatic relationship with Libya, had several meetings with Libya's leaders to investigate the charges of the alledged assassination plot.  The State Department made it very clear that if they actually uncovered such a plan, Libya would be in big trouble.  Apparently everything was kosher (ha ha) because after these meetings the diplomatic decision was made.    So why am I telling you this?  During these meetings,    Burns said the two sides "held detailed discussions on Libya's commitment to support the global war on terrorism, to repudiate the use of violence for political purposes and to implement its pledge to cease all support for terrorism."   Apparently Libya took this directive as an X-Treme World Combatant license, and now are threatening to bomb Chad unless they hand over Ammari Saifi - sporting the flashy alias Abderrezak - who last year lead a group which kidnapped 32 European tourists in Algeria.  Saifi leads the  urlLink Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat , who are not only apparently to blame for heisting the tourists but also have links to al-Qaeda.   So, thus far we're dealing with the Libya, Chad, Algeria, and the autonomous European Unit.  This is where it gets fun.  In September 2003, Germany issued an international arrest warrant for Saifi, and the Movement for Democracy and Justice (MDJC) in Chad  urlLink arrested him in accordance to the warrant .   urlLink In 1998 the MDJC began an armed rebellion against the Chad government , and after  urlLink having a look  at a few  urlLink Transparency International  reports and  urlLink related news stories , maybe this wasn't such a bad idea.  The MDJC and the government of Chad signed an official peace agreement in 2001.  The MDJC and Deby not only signed the initial peace agreement in 2001, but have since updated it annually in 2002 and 2003.  In 2003, MDJC's hardline militant leader Yussuf Togoimi was killed and the kinder, gentler Togoi Abbo took over and the new agreement was signed;  this latest agreement also provided for some members of the MDJC to be appointed as ministers of Chad's government, which officially remakes the MDJC central leadership and core as a political party with recognized office holders.  Now, it certainly doesn't help that  urlLink hardliners in the north of Chad refuse to recognize the treaty  and that Togoi Abbo was not literally living in Chad when he negotiated the secret deal but rather in Burkina Fasso, where he'd been since 2000.  So the problem is, the United States is allied with Idriss Deby, Chad's president, and MDJC are seeking his ouster.  They are doing so because every level of Chad's government and public process is corrupt, right down to the dog catchers.   urlLink Not paying attention to history and Chevron's horrific results from a previous attempt at oil extraction , Exxon, Chevron, a Malaysian oil company, the World Bank, and the Deby administration have been working on a new pipeline through Chad and Cameroon for the last four years which was recently finished.  So, the MDJC (who is, if you'll remember, holding a known terrorist with actual ties to al-Qaeda   they arrested   legally on an international arrest warrant issued by Germany) is politically opposed to Idriss Deby, and even lead by an ex-Minister of defense from the Chadian government.  Libya is going to bomb the MDJC or attack them by invasion if they do not surrender this known terrorist that the United States, France, Germany, and Algeria all refused to take.  The MDJC has no means for transporting Saifi to the Western world, and  urlLink the United States refused to aid in the transport of an internationally known, operational terrorist leader with ties to al-Qaeda  despite the fact that the US has a military presence in the area specifically to combat terrorism .    Go back and read that last part again.  I'll wait.  So now you're wondering why in the hell I've given you all this background information about Libya attacking a rebel group with   a disenfranchised political leader  a hardline militant wing of holdouts to the north  a recognized peace accord with the Chadian government  possession of an Algerian terrorist prisoner  and also an oil pipeline running from Chad to Cameroon that is now actively producing millions of barrels of oil.  Well, here's the punchline, so far.  Like most good jokes, its in two parts:   Togoi Abbo, a former Chadian ambassador to Libya, has been resident in Ouagadougou for the past three years. His rebel movement has close links with Libya, which once claimed the Aouzou Strip in northern Chad where the MDJT is active.     urlLink UN Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs, 14 December 2003      Cameroon and Chad, two of the world's poorest countries, began to sell oil on Friday as the first shipment of 950,000 barrels of crude from their joint pipeline reached the international oil market. The pipeline was developed by an international consortium in which ExxonMobile holds 40 percent of the stakes, Malaysia's Petronas 35 percent and ChevronTexaco 25 percent. The World Bank has invested close to $93 million in the $3.7 billion-project and others including the European Investment Bank and the US Export-Import Bank have invested in it.   urlLink UN Integrated Regional Information Networks, 6 October 2003     I'll give you even money that  urlLink with all of the problems Chad is having with Darfur and Sudan , it won't be long before the new pipeline running through the region becomes a hotly contested military / economic target.  Libya attacks Chad,  urlLink Chad ends up in a two front war with around 60% of its border becoming hostile , Sudanese refugees consume Chad's already tiny amount of resources, Libya invades Chad in earnest, and pretty soon we end up with Chalibya, or Libyad.  Whichever way it goes, it will be the Badass Republic of Oil (BROIL), controlling a much more sizable chunk of the world's oil supply than Libya ever had before.  I'm not saying this is going to happen, but when Libya gains diplomatic and trade relations with the civilized world on promises of non-violence, and then takes up Bush's Flaming Sword and tries to eat Chad, I think the situation and the brazen animals involved bear watching.   Qadhafi is a snapping dog, an actual terrorist leader of not just an actual terrorist group but an  actual terrorist nation  that the Bombs-For-Jesus crowd failed to handle in the 1980's despite a crushing grip on the United States decision-making limbs.  Now, after a quick PR refurbishment, they're in the process of paying $2.7 billion to the families of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103 which they gleefully bombed to confetti in the 80's and are bombing political parties on foreign soil for harboring terrorists.  We'll see, I suppose.  The beasts are dangerous as always, and newly uncaged.

         When I packed my bags for Chicago, there was nothing unusual about including a Bell motorcycle helmet, yellow ski goggles, a new pair of Chuck Taylor All-Stars and a short billy club.  Packing for Chicago was not like taking off for Club Med.   - Hunter S. Thompson,  A Generation Of Swine     What Thompson is talking about here is heading for the Democratic National Convention in 1968.  Hubert Humphrey was beaten by Richard Nixon by around 500,000 votes in the following presidential election, and the rest, as they say, is history.  From that point on, until Clinton appeared and bestowed some deliverance upon the Democrats, they lost 5 out of 6 elections and Carter was more or less a fluke.    Thompson was describing this during a characteristic lament about Dukakis' defeat in 1988 against the first George Bush, who had somehow waded his way through the minefield of the Iran-Contra affair and came out smelling miraculously like roses instead of the slime he had trod through.  Everyone associated with Dutch and the whole late-term mess they put together should probably have been tied up in burlap sacks and shipped to Guatemala, but they weren't.  The reason stands to this day, and I'm not sure I will hear much argument about it: that Dukakis lost the election far more than Bush won it.  By all accounts, the current Bush should have been done by now. It would be much easier on everyone if he just put down the Flaming JudeoSword of Justice and confessed his sins.  But he won't, because we're letting him get away with it.  In 2004 we find ourselves in a similar situation to 1988: Kerry is running even keel with Bush right now on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, and I have no doubt we can expect a temporary surge in poll numbers for our team once the convention is complete.  It is important, however, to remember how many days there are between now and when we will vote and try and save the country from the newly empowered remnants of Reagan's Bombs-And-Jesus crowd.  Many days equals many opportunities to blow it, and the responsibility to avoid political implosion rests upon the whole party, not just Kerry and Edwards.  Bush isn't doing much to  win  the election thus far - being president already helps quite a bit, and I have no doubt that many well-intentioned but uninformed voters will consider the fact that we haven't all been vaporized by the Evil-Doing Brown Men from Farawayistan and vote for Bush because of it.  It is a grand mistake and one borne of ignorance, but it will happen.  This is the caliber of political thought we are dealing with in this country.  I even know a girl I went to high school with who says she's going to vote for Bush strictly because he's from Texas.  It is frightening, yes, but it has been considered before.  Adlai Stevenson was not the only person to say, "In a democracy, people get the kind of government they deserve."  The only problem is, the deserving majority may end up outweighing the people who actually use their brains and see what is happening around them.    Are the transgressions of this Bush worse than those his father and Dutch perpetrated during the Iran-Contra debacle?  You bet your ass they are.  But that isn't the important question, because  most people don't care .  At least it seems that way. I hope people figure out that Bush is starting to talk about what he calls a  urlLink "comprehensive solution to the Cuba problem" and bringing democracy to the down-trodden people of Cuba.   Does that sound familiar?  It should, because he's used this language before in his pep talks about Iraq.    We have a pool going right now on which country we'll invade or go to war with next.  At the moment, the odds-on favorite is Cuba at 4-1, but I've got my money on China.  If Bush manages to bolt himself into the Oval Office for another four terrible years, I expect to see a numbers shake-up and then we'll see a China-Taiwan-US cage match maybe all the way down to 3-1.  He'll have more time to prepare, and  urlLink to catch up with the SEVEN AIRCRAFT CARRIERS  he just sent to the Taiwan Strait, a week after  urlLink China practiced invading Taiwan.   So anyways, here comes the DNC, and I'm still trying to figure out a way to get into it and determine if we, as the collective opposition to Bush 2004, have a plan beyond "Don't screw up."

       INTERNAL MEMO - NOT FOR RELEASE - INTERNAL MEMO 	  From:  Jeff Shipley, Grand Dragon of Marketing/Public Relations To:  Grand Wizard of the KKK, All Grand Dragons of the KKK, Area Recruitment Heads, and Shift Managers   Hey gang-  Jeff Shipley here,  thrilled  to be working with the Ku Klux Klan.  Little background on me:  I’m 31 years old, spent the last three with Pierce & Banner PR after leaving MPACT Marketing.  Married, no kids (unless you count our dachshund Contessa!), and a sweet summer duplex in Portland.  I was hired to help bring the Klan up to date with today’s marketing.  Folks, public opinion is worth a lot.  It can literally make or break you.  Literally.  Historically, the Klan has always been at odds with public opinion.  I’m here to change all that.  I’ve looked at the facts and figures, and talked to a number of you personally, and I think I just might have a plan.  A 4-Point plan to make the KKK bigger and better than ever before!   Point-1:  The Blacks   I know, I know, I just hit you with the big one right off.  Well frankly, I just don’t have time to screw around.  Not if I’m going to get this ship back on track.  I understand several of you have a lot of anger and bitterness towards the increasing number of black celebrities in the world; rap artists, professional athletes, etc.  Yes, more black people enjoy fame and fortune than ever before, but look at the overall picture:  the numbers of black people involved in serious crime has climbed higher than ever, civil rights are constantly being ignored, and discrimination has been holding steady for the past 5 years.  Don’t let a few good apples spoil the bunch.  And another thing:  let’s cut out using the ‘n’ word.  I know how fond of it many of you are, but let’s face it:  due to the acceptance of the word within black culture, they mostly don’t care.  It was high time to let it go, anyway.  I mean, we don’t still ride around on horseback when we burn churches, right?   Point-2:  The Hispanics   The good news is the so-called ‘Latin explosion’ in popular culture never really materialized.  The bad news is that statistics show that by the year 2010, Hispanics will become the majority, surpassing Caucasians.  This means we have to start making more proud white people.  So let’s get started on this as soon as possible.  2010 isn’t that far away, and your retarded cousin isn’t going to get pregnant by herself.   Point-3:  The Gays   Gay culture is constantly making new inroads with mainstream pop culture through television shows, movies and other machinations of the Homosexual-Jewish conspiracy in Hollywood.  Rather than attack, I say we use them to our own advantage.    David Duke was arguably the most visible leader of the Klan, and look at the man!  No wonder he lost the governor’s race in Louisiana!  Duke wants to run for Congress when he’s released from prison later this year, and someone’s obviously set the wayback machine for 1988!  I’ve got a call out to 2 of the 5 ‘Queer Eye for the Straight Guy’ guys, and hopefully (fingers crossed!) we’ll have David ready for his inauguration photos in no time!   Point-4:  The Kids   This is really the backbone of the whole plan.  We need to stop thinking in the now, and think in the  after -now.  Young people are not as in touch with racism as they once were.  Sure,  your  kids know white from wrong, but what about their friends, their schoolmates?  To that end, I give you the official mascot of our new children’s recruitment campaign, Krakker Jack!       Krakker Jack is a sprightly, anthropomorphized butter cracker that helps teach kids all about the KKK with his ‘Krakker Jack Facts’!    A Mexican stole your daddy’s job! Arabs smell! Don’t trust a Jew with your money! Black people have extra muscles in their legs.  That’s why they’re so good at sports!    This, more than any other initiative, must really be a team effort.  Make every Klan function into a family function.  Everyone loves a parade!  Turn rallies into singalongs!  Cross burnings into cookouts!  Nothing says family like the Klan and s’mores!  By all means folks, this is just the beginning.  I’m totally open to any suggestions you might have.  Feel free to give me a call, and I’ll be happy to talk.  Unless I’m not there, then Donna will take a message.    Jeff

       " urlLink ...watching Bush flounder when attempting to communicate extemporaneously, one is left with the impression that he is ineloquent not because he can't speak but because he doesn't bother to think.  "    Oh snap, indeed.  That's an excerpt from the linked story in Esquire entitled "The Case Against George W. Bush".  It is written by Ron Reagan.  While there is obviously a bit of opinion here and there, many facts are presented which have been in the media archives for awhile and plenty of people have compiled.  I just like that Gipper Jr. tossed it all together into a delicious Dissent Salad.  In this time of DNC Hangover, the news comes fast and furious.  Its hard for me to keep up with it all, and the news stories I do find worth mentioning are hardly done any justice by a mere link-and-blurb treatment. However, some things should be mentioned in a quick, non-analysis statement:   urlLink Bid processes are getting by-passed in Iraq, and 67 criminal investigations for fraud are under way.   That means the Coalition's Provisional Authority for rebuilding Iraq is corrupt.  That means people are stealing your money.  YOUR MONEY.   urlLink Zarqawi wasn't actually captured.    urlLink Ralph Nader, getting all kinds of help from the GOP to get on the ballot in swing states gets mad at Kerry for not sending him a fruit basket or something, says "Call off your dogs."    urlLink Don't forget about the record budget deficit posted by the White House.  $445,000,000.00   Especially when you get smoke blown up your asses about how we've "turned a corner."   urlLink Bush wants you to know he has accomplished things, and has achieved legislative and military "results".   How you interpret that is up to you.   urlLink Remember Libya?   T-r-o-u-b-l-e, that starts with T that spells "A plot to assassinate the Saudi Crown Prince." Shhhhh.   urlLink The US Embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan was bombed.    urlLink Chinese president Hu Jintao warns President Bush that "China will not tolerate Taiwan's independance",  and strongly advised the United States that it will also not tolerate the sales of weapons and technology to Taiwan.  The White House actually proclaimed that it "reaffirmed [Bush's] backing for the one-China policy - which does not support Taiwanese independence - while reasserting America's commitment to help Taiwan defend itself."  In case you couldn't tell, that's a pretty huge double standard, and one  we may end up going to war with China over .   urlLink Sudan waffles over a UN Resolution that atrocities be stopped within 30 days.   Really, who wants to stop atrocities?  Oh yeah, and  urlLink Iran has started making nuclear weapons components again .  You know what that means!  And finally, finally - two men, registered Democrats, were ordered  urlLink to sign a Pledge Of Support for President Bush before they were given tickets  to attend a speaking event by Vice-President Dick Cheney at a Rio Rancho public school in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  They tried to file a court order claiming that the event - held on public property - be open to people of all political affiliaitions, and they were denied.  OMG THE QUARTERBACK IS TOAST AM I RITE.

         UPDATE     urlLink Al-Jazeera is reporting , along with a  urlLink few   urlLink other places , that Abu Musab Zarqawi has been captured on the Iraq / Syrian border.  No actual major news sources are confirming this.  So that means either it didn't really happen, or someone would like this gather steam over the weekend and overtake the news from the White House about the  urlLink record $445,000,000,000 budget deficit .  You see, the White House releases the really bad news on Fridays at the end of the week's news cycle because it dramatically lessens the impact and fewer people care about it because far fewer people pay attention to the regular news on Fridays.  So, to draw attention to it: $445,000,000,000.00  445 billion.  The highest overdraw ever.  If the American taxpayer were a bank (which we are) what would the overdraft fees be like?  I pay $75 if I go over by as much, and it gets exponentially worse from there.  Also, "budget deficit" means "we spent this much more money than we actually had to spend."  And if the Zarqawi thing isn't true, then no one will mind if I point out how  urlLink the Bush Administration passed on definite chances to nail Zarqawi three times after September 11th.      Friday's aren't just  bad  news days, they are  scary  news days.   All around us, its a symphony of news!   urlLink Look Mom, its the Department of Homeland Security!   They are gathering information on where all the A-rabs in America live!  Just in case!  o. m. G.   urlLink Oh, and over there, its the Secret Service!   They are safeguarding against turbans loaded with Uzis!   urlLink Oh, oh, and a Bush Campaign worker says people that don't like their shitty new Bushjobs should take prozac!  Susan Sheybani, an assistant to Bush campaign spokesman Terry Holt, is the most compassionate conservative yet!   urlLink That last story has some impact, since Bush wants everyone in America to be screened for mental illness and the House Appropriations Committee set aside $20,000,000 for it.   You guys chew on that while I go see the Manchurian Candidate.

       urlLink These guys are total morons.   The way this is going to play out is that Boston cops snapped on the last day or something, but let me tell you the truth about it:  Several protester groups planned to cause trouble today.  I heard it from cops, I especially heard it from protestors, I heard it from all kinds of people that today was going to be the day that the protesters got rowdy and caused trouble, and that it was gonna go down at the Fleet Center.  I just wanted to make that clear.   urlLink The Black Tea Society and the Boston Indy Media  are talking about it all here, but just keep in mind that if you plan on getting arrested, you aren't really getting harassed by cops when it happens.

       urlLink These poor bastards.   I'll tell you why it sucks to be a Texas delegate at the DNC - when I was covering happenings outside the Fleet Center and around Boston yesterday, I saw a Texas Delegate buy his own lunch.  If he'd been from North Carolina or Ohio, someone would have been throwing filet mignon at him.  Instead, he walked from the Fleet center to a sub shop and bought his lunch and then ate by himself.  I asked him for a comment.  His face lit up, briefly shining with the idea that someone...  cared  about him.  He didn't have much to say.  No goodies, no love, barely even any attention from anyone at the event.  Mostly they are treated with a sad smile and a shake of the head.  They come from the land of Bush, he says, and it might as well be Mars.  After speaking with him, I walked into the famed Protest Pen, the Cage, and find it almost totally empty.  There are tattered, sodden remains of signs clinging to the fences and tourists walking around taking pictures of them.  They say things like "IS THIS DEMOCRACY?" and "IS THIS THE FREEDOM WE'RE FIGHTING FOR?"  A guy snapping pictures looks up at the razor wire and says "Oh look, its true."  Besides tourists, there are several police officers patrolling the area.  I snag one and ask for a few words, which she says she'll give so long as I don't use her name.  The female police officer tells me that things have been really quiet and that, for the most part, the protesters haven't caused one bit of trouble, and what's more, have been really respectful and nice. However, there haven't hardly been many protesters at all, and they apparently were hearing that Thursday was "Civil Disobedience Day" and that the kids were planning on getting rowdy.  One sign had been removed from a police fence so that the cops could see through it, but that was mostly it for confrontations so far.  The only actual incident had occured on Tuesday when the geniuses from GodHatesFags.com showed up.  They yelled at every delegate, calling them sodomites, and told all the protesters and cops they were going to hell.  My favorite part of this story is how the anti-abortion protestors ended up getting in a major scuffle with the GodHatesFags crew, which resulted in the latter group getting tossed.  "They had little kids with them," the cop tells me, shaking her head.  "I live in Southie and I never seen people as mean as what I saw yesterday.  Are they all in one big family or what?"  I answer her. "It wouldn't surprise me if they're all related, if you catch my meaning.  They all belong to one big church, in Alabama.  Apparently it is the church of God's elect, his special children.  According to them, anyways."  "Easy for them to say." she says.  "Little kids, man."  "They have monuments on their website dedicated to displaying how long victims of hate crimes have been burning in hell.  They have one for Matthew Sheppard, they picket other churches for being Godless whores, and so on and so forth,"  I tell her.    She just sort of stares at me in disbelief.  "That's actually a church?"    We talk about the general consequences of filling little kids up with hate for a while, and then I move on.    As I leave the Protest Pen, a sax player starts ripping into "America The Beautiful."  The cops all smile and clap.  The version is really soulful, and I can't help but grin.  I see a slat-shouldered blonde man waiting by the gate to get in, and I accost him.  He looks like a journalist, and I want to find out what the media accomodations have been like for the little guy. He turns out to not just be a journalist, but from the foreign press, from Finland.    I ask him how covering American politics differs from Scandinavian political journalism, and he laughs, telling me that he's only heard people call it Finlandish or even Dutch journalism.  I apologize on behalf of my geographically challenged countrymen.  He tells me there is much more pageantry and orchestration in this convention than he ever sees at home.  "Of course," he says, "I haven't seen a coronation in a while, either."  Mr. Finland goes on to tell me that they have been provided with excellent work space but that they have the same access problem that always exists for journalists.  He also laments the lack of real news, and seems amazed by the idea that "Shove it" serves as a leading story in this vacuum.  "You know," I say, "'Shove it' would have been news in American politics no matter what, sad as that is."  "Yeah," he says.    I tell him that that if he'd been here in the seventies he could have experienced the McGovern convention, which had quite a bit more action, or God forbid, Chicago in 1968.  I also say that Americans fall asleep when you start talking about substance or policy or what you're actually going to spend their money on, and he laughs.  "Kerry's biggest danger is changing to please anyone at the last minute." Finland opines. "It seems like in American politics, no matter what you do will get you in trouble, so he should just be who he is.  There's less chance of screwing things up that way."  "You are a politically keen observer," I say. "Stay away from my job."  I head into the D'angelos where I saw the poor Texas delegate feeding himself and I get a sandwich.  Two interviews makes it time to eat.  I get about halfway through my sandwich when the first one lands - the pidgeon, I mean.  The dirty flying rats smell my bread from the rooftops, and suddenly I'm surrounded on all sides by the nasty animals, all cooing and waiting for me to show a moment of weakness, during which they will overtake me.  I put my sandwich away and stand up, and as I do, a raucous cheer sounds behind me, up the street.  I turn around and see a man phalanxed by what appear to be adoring hordes.  I gird up my journalistic loins and make a run for it, because I've just realized I'm watching Howard Dean walk up the street.  "Howard Dean!" I holler.  "How will things be on Friday morning?"  Dean looks me right in the eye and says "We're a whole new party, and we're gonna show them what that means."  Then he is borne away by the Deaniacs, looking as if at any moment he will be lifted onto their shoulders, or set into a litter and carried to the City of Gold, or perhaps flown into a hole in Heaven that opens just for him.  After this I interviewed a few volunteers.  They told me their job is to help people have as much fun as possible, to help them have an easy time in the city.  Colleen is a lifelong Boston resident who votes every chance she gets and leads her team of volunteers.  I see Colleen and her team tell people where to go, take pictures for them, give directions on the phone, and generally have a good time hanging out together, being of service.  Colleen smiles easily and wears sandals.  Dana is another volunteer, a 27 year old grad student.  She is all flush with excitement from seeing Dean and seems a bit reluctant to be interviewed, but soon she opens up.  She tells me she would like to one day go into city government, and she loves the idea of government and democracy.  "Hang on," she says after about five minutes of talking. "I have to help these delegates."  Then she is gone into the crowds.  What she said - the "idea" of government and democracy - really hit me as I climbed onto the T and headed for home, to get my ill-fated scoop up on this page.  I can only assume that this idea she talks about is the same one that made me get all teary-eyed when John Edwards spoke.  The idea that things  can  get better is one of the few thoughts I've had lately that is stronger than the knowledge that things are totally cockeyed now.    The idea we've been living with for the last three years is that things are fine, and they are not.  My friends' parents are routinely laid off from jobs they've given 28 and 29 years to, mere months before their retirement benefits would come full.  Now they have nothing.  My parents are some of the hardest working people I have ever known, period, and they usually have to count on luck to get through the month, let alone through to retirement.  The generation that fought the Vietnam war is getting screwed along with the rest of us in cycles so vast it must make them difficult to see.   My mother has a year book from her Senior year in high school, and like most people's yearbooks there are signatures in the front, back, and on photos.  I was thumbing through it when I was about twelve and I saw that at least seven or eight pictures per page had a black  X  in the corner.    I said "Mom, these X's, are these your friends?"  She said "No, Josh, those are the ones that died in Vietnam, or came back ruined."  So there's that to consider, when I look at my generation, and how many of us are in danger or are dying, or have died.  I see my generation slowly waking up and getting more involved, but for the most part they remain untouched, and some are even satisfied, thinking the number of people lost is okay so long as the Evil-Doers get bounced.  So people can't pay their bills or the rent or have health insurance or are dodging RPGs in some Third World Hell Hole, and you want to tell me everything is fine?  The idea of government and democracy has a central theme, I believe, of actually being able to affect change when things go wrong.  I would like to think this idea isn't a lie.  Maybe I've gone from being a liberal centrist to a populist optimist, I don't know.  What I do know is that these next few months are going to be a knockdown dragout bar brawl.   Anyways, enough of that depressing noise.  Here's a picture my friend Lexi made.

       Day 1     Jimmy Carter  - It was interesting to hear Jimmy Carter rip into anything, especially at this convention which has more or less been geared towards not ripping, tearing, bashing, or rending.  I hear even some party insiders were surprised at how negative he went.  I'm not really sure I care, because I love Jimmy Carter.  His speech was pretty good but his delivery was hampered by old.   Grade: B      Hillary Clinton  - Sweety, we know you didn't get to give as much of a speech as you would have liked.  Yes, it was potentially a disaster for the Party that they went to at least some trouble to rectify.  You make it worse when you joke about it.  The ten seconds you used for your "practically speechless" line could have been better used, and instead you reminded us of something negative.   Grade: D      Bill Clinton  - I don't what else can be said about this cat.  He effectively disarmed the GOP's ability to respond to his crushing criticisms of their economic policy by including himself as a rich guy that benefitted from it.  The only possible downfall to this is a GOP ad asking why he didn't just give his extra money to the government, but that would be foolish and ill-advised. Attacking a rock star always is.  Grade: A      Terry McAuliffe  - I actually witnessed this: Terry's aide: "Don't yell, watch your voice, okay?" Terry: "Sure thing." (Terry goes out on stage) Terry: (immediately starts yelling)  Aside from his voice sounding a little rough, Terry has done better than some of the featured speakers as far as actual public speaking goes.   Grade: B+      Al Gore  - I wanted more screaming, didn't you?  The parts where he chuckled it up were cute and everything, but I really wish he'd had more sack in 2000, so we  could  be re-electing his silly ass.  I   Grade: B      DNC Credentialed Bloggers  - Most of the blogs eat it.  Let's be honest.  I've read some really poor writing about nothing, some decent writing about nothing, some poor writing about something, but only a few blogs have consistently good writing about consistently interesting things.  I don't want to hate on anyone (as I am, after all, a professional), so I'm just gonna link to the good ones:   urlLink Daniel Rubin   urlLink Centrist Coalition   urlLink Opinions You Should Have   urlLink National Journal   urlLink Dave Pell         urlLink Mathew Gross    General DNC Blogger Coverage Grade: C+      Day 2      Benjamin McKenzie  - Hey look, its the kid from the OC - a show all of the smart people I know watch for no obvious reason!  I can't argue with his message, in that he wants young people to vote.  His jokes about Bush were also not bad.  I will not show him the rough side of my tongue because of his show's vapidity. For an actor with no previous political stumping he seemed to do pretty okay.   Grade: C+      Performance by Peter, Paul and Mary: "Blowin'In The Wind"  - What the shit is this?  DNC, you couldn't dig up Joan Baez or Bob Dylan?  Dylan will take money for anything nowadays - didn't you see his Victoria's Secret Model Hostage TV spot?  They look like they broke out of the home and got busker's licenses.   Grade: D-      Tom Daschle  - I've joked about Tom Daschle being unexciting before.  I may have even called him "Snoozefest McGhee".  Last night, his oration literally knocked my ass out for an hour.  He instigated a nap  so powerful  that despite my having the TV up really loud, I slept right through Dean and some of Obama.  Imagine how upset I was.  Damn you, Tom Daschle, and your Vocal Sleep Rays.   Grade: D      Dick Gephardt  - I had a friend within the Gephardt campaign, and she affectionately calls him "Geppie".  I've always liked Gephardt, even way back in '88 I liked him, and I was only 9. He's a good politician with good ideas, and his speech was, I thought, really good.  Too bad none of the unappreciative bastards in the hall realized that they were in the midst of the Really Good.  Good speech, poor control of the crowd.  Tie goes to the runner.   Grade: B      Howard Dean  - I love Howard Dean.  I think he's a badass, and among the superstars in the Democratic galaxy, he's one of the biggest.  His speech was decent but it was sort of uncharacteristcally fluffy.  Of note concerning the language of his speech: the antecedents and consequents in Dean's language were mostly personal - I, me, my, etc. This in balance against the much smaller amount of inclusive language (we, us) should be noted as good politics. Some people will tell you this is Dean pushing his own agenda, but they are wrong - his speech needed to be mildly exclusive in its language so the Deaniacs could feel as if they were finally being folded into the rest of the Democratic party they did so much to energize.  Dean scores with smart politics, and the Music Supervisor of the DNC wins the Semiotics Sign / Signifier Pair Award for Dean's exit music: "We Are Family".   Grade: A      Ted Kennedy  - How can you not get excited about Theodore delivering a speech to his hometown crowd?  You could remember 1988, I suppose.  A lot of us young Democrats ask the old Democrats "Hey, why hasn't Ted ever become President?" and the old Democrats just look sad.  He was the Senator who would be king, but instead he's become a venerable institution in the Senate and its a better legislative body because of him.  His speech, however, didn't really juice my stones.  It could have been his delivery or his cracking voice, I'm not sure.  It could have been the speakers he's competing with, but who cares?  He's Teddy Kennedy and he kicks ass.  I'm still docking his grade though.  Grade: C+      Ron Reagan  - Dear Ron, get off your ass and help us.  You will make an awesome Democrat.  You will be our secret weapon against the remnants of your father's administration.  The Bombs-N-Jesus Crowd will weep as you claim your place among us.  It'll be just like a kung-fu movie, where Rumsfeld was your father's student, and now his master is gone but the prodigal son returns to do battle...   ...ON A FIERY ROOFTOP    Do it.  Do it, damn you.  Grade: A      Teresa Heinz Kerry  - I get it, you're smart.  Stop gibbering at me in foreigner!  On a more serious note, I kind of like her.  I admit, its based entirely on "Shove it", and even more on her reticent refusal to apologize for it.  To know that she was interested in civil and human rights  before  she became mind-warpingly rich also helps my opinion of her.  She should have talked on Monday though, or tonight. Her speech was just a little too calm to be where it was in the line-up.  Grade: B+      Barack Obama  - Are you there God?  Its us, the Democratic Party.  After years of brutal punishment and the inability to organize ourselves you blessed us with a firebrand like Howard Dean, a reincarnation of Clinton in John Edwards, someone actually electable in John Kerry, a progressive voice in Kucinich, an excellent party leader and brilliant strategist in Terry McAuliffe, a Republican that's on our side in Wes Clark and a rallying point in George Bush.  We don't know what we did to deserve these blessings, Lord, and certainly we don't what we did to deserve Barack Obama, the Home Run Holy Hand Grenade of blessings, but thanks.  We'll try not to pooch the deal in the next 12 years or so.  Signed,  The Democratic Party  Grade: A+

      An anonymous source in the Boston Police Department told me just minutes ago that a warehouse has been discovered in Cambridge, MA full to the ceilings with containers full of feces, urine, and blood.  It is not confirmed yet, but according to my source, authorities believe that this warehouse was being rented by or belonged to an activist group operating out of Boston.  I am currently attempting to get confirmation from Boston PD Media Relations.  More on this story will follow.     UPDATE (5:00 PM): Cambridge PD media relations offered this comment: "We haven't heard anything about it."   UPDATE (7:30 PM): Boston PD Media Relations says: "We haven't heard anything about this, and we don't think its true.  Its not true."  So, apparently, there is no truth to the above story.  The Boston PD officer I spoke seems to have been misinformed, or it was a rumor with legs.  There goes my damn scoop.

        "The attendees were generally very happy with the celebrities and elected officials that appeared. There's no question that the extensive 6-hour free program presented by DemocraticGain and RockTheVote which included the likes of Biz Markee and Laryn Hill was enjoyed by all.  It is unfortunate that scheduling conflicts did not allow the Clintons to attend, but there were several opportunities to hear from elected officials and this week should provide the public with many opportunities to see the Clintons and other members of the Democratic party and hear them speak."  - Josh Grossfeld,  urlLink DemocraticGAIN    Once Biz Markie was done with us, the entertainment for the evening slowed down quite a bit.  Diana and I decided to try and see where our bracelets would get us, and that turned out to be "everywhere" for at least a while.  The only downside was that nowhere was really as cool as the VIP room up the stairs, and no one was really hanging out in there.    We were on our way down to the dance floor and a young female Democrat grabbed my wife's ass as she passed by, which was excellent on several levels, especially since she had assured me that I would be the one getting hit on that night.    The natives were already getting restless and it was barely midnight; half-hearted chants of "We Want Bill" would start and die on the floor like some pathetic engine.  Diana commented on the fact they seemed to be unable to commit to their raucous drunken chant and I agreed.  Bill had not shown up yet and the joy in Mudville was starting to look endangered.  There were some more DJs, and then this other band took about an hour and a half to set up.  The word in the crowd was that this was Lauryn Hill's band, and that they would be accompanying Bill as he melted our faces off with a kick ass sax solo.  I had my own doubts about Bill showing up, since I had learned the disparity between the star Democrats' schedules had been causing no small amount of irritation and inconvenience all night.  I did not spread this around because I am a professional.  "Oh, he's definitely coming."  I said to the Young Democrat student representatives from BC and other assorted colleges.  "To doubt that Bill will show up would be to doubt the veracity of the party! Besides, they've closed off the VIP area now, because Bill is on his way."  This was half true.  Security had apologetically not allowed me back upstairs to the drink-bins and easy bathrooms because of a fervent security event.    "Bill is coming!  He's coming!" said one security detail member.  "Tra la!" he added.  "The Rolling Stones are here!" said another.  This latter turned out to be true, as far as I know - but they never came downstairs.   So at this point (around 1:20 am) I'm fully drunk and beginning to wonder where all the celebrities are.  I'm also beginning to wonder why all of the DemoKids are getting so pissed off about the fact that Bill Clinton hasn't shown up yet, and probably won't.    "Fuck this!" shouted one guy, wearing a Fleet Center pass.  "At least I'll get another tax cut in 2005!"    "Whoa, cowboy!" I said.  "You're on the team here.  You guys are trying to save the country.  Are you really going to give up just because Bill's a little busy during the Democratic National Convention?  I mean, shouldn't he be?"  "Who the hell are you?" he asked.  "Josh Berthume, from DamnTheMan.net.  Can I get a quote on how you're quitting the job and why?"  He vacated the area.  This is another important lesson I learned.  Once you get a few drinks in a politico, they'll talk about anything you want to talk about and usually get pretty spirited, especially if it deals with public policy; the more drunk they are, the more severe and sweeping their judgments become.  But the second you say you are  with  someone, even if it is a nebulous publication / website they've never heard of, they immediately cover the Name portion of their badge, lose all the color in their face, and run away like you just attempted to shiv them.  At any rate, the mood was uneven.  The kids were happy and enjoyed the party and there was some general disappointment about Bill not showing up but that seemed to pass for most people.  Not all, but most. The "most" category seemed to include all of the actual Convention attendees and workers.  The people who seemed the most upset were the volunteers and the students - I'm not privy to all the work they've been putting in for the last few weeks, but I think this ultra-exclusive event and its star guests were a reward, after a fashion, and it didn't turn out exactly the way it was promised.  1:45 am rolls around and there is finally motion on the stage - Lauryn Hill's band has been playing for about 20 minutes and she joins them on stage with a quarter of an hour to go. She sings one song, which is all she has time for, and then the party is over.  The older crowd filters out almost immediately, talking amongst themselves and looking as if they have had a really excellent time.  They are, for the most part, not surprised that the Clintons did not show up.    I'm not surprised either, frankly.  In a wide, wide Democratic field of superstars, Bill Clinton is the equivalent of the Beatles, Elvis, and Christ all rolled into one man.  Anyone who watched his speech on Monday night will agree with me wholeheartedly.  If you don't believe me, watch some of the coverage and see if you can spot the men and women among the Delegates  OPENLY WEEPING .  Clinton is a reliquary and within him lies the great and terrible knowledge of how things were before everything got so strange and demented in Washington in the hands of the wrong people.  If Roosevelt got four terms, Clinton could crown himself Glorious General For Life and no one at the Fleet Center Monday night would have thought twice about it, save for Hillary.  This means that Bill is busy.  Gore separated himself from Clinton in 2000 and that was a mistake.  It isn't his fault: politically, it really seemed like the only viable option and I'm sure he had his cadre of 24-35 year olds telling him to stay away.  But the Democratic party was different then, for some reason still carrying the shame of the Eighties around their necks like an albatross and for some reason still gunshy against any sort of character indictment from the GOP, as if they carried scepters imbued with Reagan's essence and he watched from Santa Barbara like an angry, judgmental God, ready to impugn his will upon the Democrats for any sort of transgression.    Today things are different.  When Terry McAuliffe met me, I told him I was a big fan of his work.  He said "Well thanks, it's a whole new Party," and this is more true than most people realize.  Not only does the Democratic Party have a depth uncharacteristic for American politics in general, we have a sense of unity now not unlike the one the Republicans have browbeaten us with for two generations.  Theirs comes from a smug moralistic self-righteousness that they wear with pride like a cheap suit on Prom Night.  Ours comes from the overarching feeling we have of being backed into a corner in a life-or-death situation.  It is unfortunate that unity had to come in such a package for either side, but this is how it is.  So Bill is busy, because he's stumping for Kerry, and the whole party is finally and for once unified behind an idea, the idea of fixing things.  Bill is busy appearing at events geared both to the Democrats and the general public, because every time Bill shows up anywhere he gets at least 10 votes for the Democrats we wouldn't have gotten without him making the appearance, and probably more.  Bill is busy because the Democrats have deployed him like some sort of Charisma-Delivery Missile System because they failed to utilize him in 2000 and they don't want to fuck up like that again. It is possible Bill was too busy to show up at Avalon because the Party needed him somewhere else more than they needed him to preach to the converted  So some college kids missed their chance to see Clinton up close and personal, and a few kids I talked to were upset.  Heather, from Boston College, told me that Bill is her idol and she'd been racing from event to event all day to just try and get a look at him.  But none of them seemed totally disappointed with the Avalon party in general, which was pretty hot.  Everyone seemed energized by the speakers and ready to kick ass and take names for the next three months.    As Diana and I were leaving we ended up in some totally bizarre debate with a Libertarian, one of those "Backbone" guys, and a guy from North Carolina who talked with a Brooklyn accent and was apparently a Neanderthal Republican.  This latter GOP rep called my wife a Dixie Chick for being from Texas and she was very sensibly offended.  Seeing that our previous residence would do nothing to help our argument that this isn't the year to try and turn our political party system into France's, I hailed a cab.    P.S. Robert Smigel and Triumph were outside, having apparently been barred from entering the party.  The publisher of Spin Magazine was also there.  I introduced myself to him as the editor of damntheman.net, and he said "Great" and turned towards Smigel, trying to get his attention.  After figuring out it was more or less a recruiting pitch to appear at events in New York for Spin, Smigel and Triumph turned to me. "Who are you weeth?  Damn de Man?" Triumph asked.  The guy from Spin looked defeated and walked away.  Smigel had never heard of us and he isn't a reader, but he did give me this quote:   Man, I would love to hump Hillary's legs.   - Triumph The Insult Comic Dog, 25 July 2004

      Tonight I saw a side of politics that most people don't get to see.  I met a large and varied cast of characters, talked to many Democrats young and old, and learned a thing or two about dedicated political participants in the process.  Diana and I arrived at the Kenmore Square T-stop at 9:40.  The party had begun at 9:00.  Since it had been described to me by my contact as a fairly exclusive affair, I figured showing up fashionably late would make it seem as if I wasn't out of my depth.  I was wrong, because as we turned down Lansdowne Street from Comm Ave I saw a teeming mass of people.  Of note (and eventual importance) is how diverse this giant crowd was - a protester on a bicycle with a barely legible hand-written sign stood and screamed at a stand-up for CNN;  urlLink LaRouche Democrats  hollered snide remarks at DNC staffers manning the doors while Biz Markie stood next to me under the canopy and waited to catch the attention of the security detail.  The Biz and I had a conversation, and it went like this:  Me: Sup Biz? Biz: Sup foo. Me: You kick the jamz that I need pretty hard. Biz: Word.  Diana waited for me at the end of the block-long line while I approached the doors and did a little name dropping.  I mentioned that my contact had put me on "the list" to a harried-looking but friendly staffer at Avalon's main entrance and she said "Let me find out something for you." and then disappeared.  I felt as if the whole thing could go awry very quickly and assumed I'd never see her again, but she came back and told me that the person with the VIP / DNC list had disappeared and she couldn't help me.    Apparently there were several lists and it was hard to keep track of them all.  For instance, a girl next to me was with  urlLink RockTheVote  and said she was on  some other  list, the specific "Rock The Vote" list.  The staffer looks at her with mild exasperation and says "You aren't the only one having this problem - RockTheVote got 500 tickets and they invited 1000 people, telling them all they were on "the list".  So "the list" is a genuinely dangerous thing, able to mutate and grow beyond the control of its creators, like Jurassic Park or Justin Timberlake.  About that time my cell phone rang and Diana told me that my contact was coming in and that I might try and get her attention before she disappeared inside.  Important Lesson #1 - if your name is on "the list", you must assume that everyone's name is on "the list" (see mutation clause above) and make sure you have someone on the other side of the rope to point at you and say "He's with me."  If my contact hadn't been there to grab us and pull us inside, I seriously doubt we would have ever gotten in, despite the apparently all-powerful wristbands which we'd been given.  The wristbands only bought us a place in a rather long line behind a Congressman, staffers beyond number, and the Chairman of a Latino Democrat association - it was only the personal touch that got us through the door in a reasonable amount of time.   The wristbands were really the key to the whole evening.  Garnishing stares of naked envy from the surrounding people, we were lead upstairs to the VIP area and away from the hollering multitudes on the dancefloor. Every area except the general common area was restricted to a certain color of wristband, but my contact had delivered unto us the unholy Black Wristband, which creates and destroys all other wristbands with its great and terrible power. As we went upstairs, Natalie Portman passed on her way down.  I wouldn't have known this if Diana hadn't told me later, so in hindsight I'm really glad I didn't trip and send Amidala careening down a narrow stairwell and into history.  Once upstairs, I had some time to talk to my contact, which was nice.  We're old friends and we had been originally planning on dinner and drinks; this would have been better in some ways because we would have had more time to catch up, but then I probably wouldn't have gotten to see Al Sharpton do the Ed Lover dance, which I'll explain in a minute.  Once we'd had a few minutes to talk, we were introduced to Terry McAuliffe, the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee.  Terry's a nice guy, and the more we talked the more he seemed like a regular personable guy, as well.  He was funny, laughed easily, and when Diana or I were speaking it seemed as if he was really listening to us as opposed to waiting for his turn to talk.  My gut tells me he's the real thing, and my gut is rarely wrong.  Next, its Terry's time to fire up the crowd, so we all head back downstairs. By some sort of sideways blessing, we end up  on stage  as Terry is giving his speech; not as if we were his posse, mind you, but just off stage-left a bit, behind some speaker stacks.  Seeing McAuliffe amp up the troops for the coming week and 99 days was pretty exciting, even though I am not strictly a card-carrying Democrat.  I recognize that speeches like his and the one Sharpton gave later on are designed to get my nads all randy for political battles, but it is easy to forget the difference between seeing something like that on TV and witnessing it in person.  I felt proud to be there and proud to be a part of it.  And then, of course, Biz Markie spun up every 70's TV theme you can think of and made people sing along to them or else he would "show them what's proper", which is probably within the Biz's jurisdiction.  During Biz's set, someone from off-stage kept trying to talk to him.  It wasn't us - by this time Diana and I had repaired to the bar - and despite seeming a bit annoyed Biz handled it well.  He would put on a different record, bust a few scratches, get the crowd going, and then clearly say something "WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT" to whoever was talking to him.  Its a good thing he was able to find out, because Al Sharpton was there and gave the crowd a talk which kicked a metric ton of ass.  It was able to kick this much ass because its argument centered around James Brown's 1968 release  The Big Payback  and how it applied to what the Democrats and the voters were going to give the GOP in November.  Biz had this record in his collection, and soon Al Sharpton and Biz Markie were busting moves flavored with Act-Rite.  Once the good Reverend started to wind down the shaking of his groove thing, Diana and I made for the VIP room again hoping to catch Sharpton in a mood which would be condusive to discussing James Brown's many talents.  It was not to be, as Al bolted for the door and likely another event.  Biz told us we needed "John Kerry up in this motherfucker" and then he had to bounce as well.  Stay tuned later today for Part 2 (Editorially truncated for length and sleep commands)

      Thanks to an old pal of mine, my wife and I are going to the  urlLink DNC Rock The Vote  party tonight at  urlLink Avalon in Boston .  There are going to be all kinds of fun people there; I've heard anyone from Affleck to Bill Clinton could show up.  On the definites list are my old (and stringently anonymous) friend and  urlLink Terry McAuliffe, Chairman of the DNC .  The question remains - what do I talk to them about if I get the chance to meet them?  I'm going to do my best stay cool and just enjoy the show, and I promise either periodic audio updates or one super-report when I get back.  Also, I've submitted DamnTheMan to  urlLink Kicking Ass , the Democratic National Committee blogwatch.  We'll see if they like us enough to include us in the proceedings over there.  Finally, I've decided to lighten up on the bill listings and geopolitical / international affairs analysis until after the convention;  we have before us one of the last remaining remnants of old-time participatory politics, and at least until they're done with Boston I'm going to focus on what's happening here.  They were nice enough to come to me, and we should remember that before anything else, we are professionals.

       urlLink Rick James is dead.   I can't believe that Blogger has been breaking on me every time I've tried to update all week, and the time it works is when I screw around and click the B on the "Rick James is dead" story.  If this actually posts maybe I can upload some of this week's update retro-style.  If not, I swear things will get back to normal as soon as Blogger quits freaking out.

       urlLink Who is Bill Gertz, you might say?   Well, he is either unable to report actual news or an evil faux-news generating boogeyman that lives in the basement at the Washington Times.  Either way his professionalism is lacking, like so many journalists in today's realm of news panderers.  This is a pure example that mouth-breathing hottentots are allowed to run amok with PRESS passes, and they are either merely inept or willfully ignorant.  Let's analyze the contents of the article linked up there, and see what we can see.    U.S. intelligence officials say a high-profile political assassination, triggered by the public release of a new message from Osama bin Laden, will lead off the next major al Qaeda terrorist attack, The Washington Times has learned.  The assassination plan is among new details of al Qaeda plots disclosed by U.S. officials familiar with intelligence reports who, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the killing could be carried out against a U.S. or foreign leader either in the United States or abroad.    Apparently going to J-School allows you to be able to say things like "could be carried out against anyone anywhere.  Maybe."  The fact that al Qaeda wants to kill people eithere here or abroad is a foregone conclusion, right?  They are not nice guys.  You should not invite them over for snacks.  Especially since they will try to kill you.  So, we know they are killers and terrorists.  This isn't much of a warning.    The officials mentioned Saudi Arabia and Yemen, two nations that are working with the United States in the battle against al Qaeda, as likely locales for the opening assassination.   The planning for the attacks to follow involves "multiple targets in multiple venues" across the United States, one official said.    Oh, okay.  Now it is multiple attacks.  The "opening assassination" is a nice touch, in that it implies that they are going on an assassination world tour.  Also, the bit about Saudi Arabia and Yemen working with e United States should be tightened up a bit, so that it more accurately reads "SAUDI ARABI AND YEMEN TRYING LIKE TO HELL TO AVOID GETTING BOMBED ALL TO SHIT + INVASION."  Okay, this wouldn't be much better as far as reporting goes, but it would at least be terribly slanted AND entertaining, as opposed to just terribly slanted.  As for "multiiple targets in multiple venues": I plan on winning an Oscar someday.  I'm just warning the other film composers out there that I'm gonna make a run at it.  However, John Williams' "new competition" warning level should probably not be raised to "Elevated" just yet.  Do you see what I'm saying?  I realize this guy is reporting something that many people will get all squishy in the shorts about, and he does too.  That's what makes him a bad man.    The new details of al Qaeda's plans were found on a laptop computer belonging to arrested al Qaeda operative Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan of Pakistan.     Ha ha.  Those guys should stick to goat carcass polo!  Obviously they don't know how to set a screensaver password!     "We're talking about planning at the screwdriver level," one official said. "It is very detailed."   Not to nitpick, but I hope its more detailed than "someplace, at some time, against anyone, there will possibly be an attack.  We found it on a laptop."  My detractors will say that these ARE the details, and I will say "Lord, why am I beset on all sides with such a sharply defined lack of intellectual competition?"  Yes, even to you,  urlLink Bob Novak.   And you tell that smug nancy  urlLink Tucker Carlson  I said bring it on.  And "screwdriver level"?  What the hell does that even mean?  But I digress.  Back to the sillyness.    Khan was arrested July 13 in Lahore, Pakistan, along with Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian who was indicted in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa and was on the FBI's list of most-wanted terrorists.    If I'm reading this right, it says that they arrested Khan along with a guy that did some very bad shit and whom the FBI was after; however, the first time I read it I thought it said that Khan was the really bad guy.  I'm sure that happens to a lot of people, and I see sentences built like this all the time: someone minor is caught but they have intel so instantly we have to know who they got arrested with and how bad the other guy is.  Its like People Magazine's  Stars At Night!  pages but for political validity instead of publicity.  God help Kumar the next time he's out with Tony Shalhoub.    U.S. and allied counterterrorism officials are pursuing leads on other terrorists based on the data from Khan's seized laptop. At least one arrest in Britain has been made so far, and others are expected, the officials said.   Additionally, U.S. intelligence officials said they think that several al Qaeda terrorists already in the United States are part of the plot, although their identities and locations are not known.    How does this read?  It reads, to the general US citizen, like this: OMG THERE ARE TERRORISTS AT WORK BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HELLOK BE SCARED LIEK WHAT  People who write  understand  the concept of how something can come off, how intpretation can be manipulated.  Even though he says the words "they think" most people will not take that into account when they are buying their duct tape.  It isn't what is said but how it is said that I have a problem with.  Stay with me though, because this is where things get really good.    The targets, in addition to the financial institutions in New York, Washington and Newark, N.J., that have been the subject of public warnings, include such economic-related targets as oil and gas facilities with a view toward disrupting the November election.   "The goal of the next attack is twofold: to damage the U.S. economy and to undermine the U.S. election," the official said. "The view of al Qaeda is 'anybody but Bush.' "    Bingo bango!  Really read what that sentence says, and how the math of it works out.  Go ahead.    Right.  What the official is saying here is that the undermining of the US election is equal to the concept of "Anybody but Bush"; if Bush loses, the terrorists win!  If you've ever said you want "Anybody but Bush" then you park your car in the same philosophical garage as the terrorists, you fucker!  Is it possible that our intrepid reporter took this official's comment out of context?  It certainly is!  So then who is at fault for this grammatical equation?       The officials also said the terrorist group has begun using female members for preattack surveillance and possibly as suicide bombers, thinking that women will have an easier time getting past security checkpoints at airports, borders and ports.   The al Qaeda attack plans call for bombings using trucks and cars, and hijacked aircraft, including commercial airliners and helicopters.   "There is a particular concern that chemical trucks will be used," one official said   In the interest of fairness, here are some details.  I think.      CHECKLIST OF THINGS TO BE FEARED   Women  Trucks  Cars  aircraft  checmical trucks  attacks  bombings  Tucker Carlson       Regarding the new bin Laden message, the officials said there are intelligence reports, some of them sketchy, that a new tape from the al Qaeda leader will surface soon.   In the past, video and audio messages by bin Laden or his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, were broadcast days or weeks before an attack, the officials said.  "The message likely will be the signal for the attack to be launched," one official said.  A second U.S. official said one intelligence agency was aware of unconfirmed reports of a new bin Laden tape. "There may be such a tape, but it hasn't surfaced and we haven't seen it," this official said.    Okay.  What you're saying, Bill Gertz, is that the Bin Laden taped message  you lead your damn report with  may or may not actually even exist? Are you fucking kidding me?  Where is your sense of journalistic responsibility?  What kind of a professional are you?  This story is intentionally misleading.  I'm smart and I thought there was a new taped message out!  Why would I think that?  Maybe its because IN YOUR FIRST SENTENCE YOU MENTION THE PUBLIC RELEASE OF A NEW TAPED MESSAGE BY OSAMA BIN LADEN.  In your title you say that "Bin Laden hints major assasination."  To someone who speaks English, this means that Bin Laden himself is actively hinting.  Possibly in a taped message.  Only 15 paragraphs later do you say that the tape is mere speculation.  Is this honestly how reporting works?  I see so much of this kind of "suppressed cable" journalism lately its like the USS Maine is sunk every day.  So, for the rest of the article:    Contrary to what some Democratic critics of the Bush administration have said, intelligence officials said the new details of al Qaeda planning were obtained from the Khan laptop. The terrorist group was in the process of updating older attack plans, the officials said.  On Aug. 2, the Bush administration raised the terrorism threat level from "elevated" to "high" for five finance-related sites in the District, New York and New Jersey, based on the intelligence in Khan's computer, as well as other intelligence.     I'm guessing this is in reference to  urlLink the Democrats' assertion that much of the information from the laptop  (which triggered the heightened terror alerts last month) was from three or more years ago. But who cares, because the word "Democrat" is in a sentence with a bunch of negative words.    Frances Townsend, a White House homeland-security adviser, said Sunday that the government has received a steady "stream" of intelligence indicating that an al Qaeda attack is planned.  "What we know now that we didn't know six months ago is that they've done a good deal of planning and surveillance work to accomplish that goal," she said on CBS' "Face the Nation."    Since I have spent an hour ripping this your piece apart, Bill, I will afford you the opportunity to defend yourself.  If I am totally remiss in calling you out on your tactics, please use your journalism skills and professional integrity and riposte forthwith, so that I might print a retraction and admit I was wrong.  I'll keep my readers updated as to how you and your paper respond.   All italicized paragraphs copyright News World Communications.  Quoted for analytical purposes only

      Last week was difficult.  The candidates and the world in general seemed reticent and hard to get a handle on.  Many things happened and reporting them from the icy backward steppes of bad wiring and orange late-summer skies proved difficult.  How grateful we all are, then, for another week.  If you will remember from several weeks ago, the  urlLink Republicans  scrounged in the absence of Jack Ryan and falsely delivered Mike Ditka for the vacant Illinois Senate seat.  For those of you who don't watch the news or pay attention to the world around, the previous sentence is not a joke: the best idea the Illinois Republicans could come up with as a collective political think tank was running a former (yet beloved) NFL Coach, Mike Ditka.  He decided not to run and so his wife isn't divorcing him, although luck, faith and hope seem to have abandoned the GOP in the Land of Lincoln:   urlLink Keyes to Challenge Obama for U.S. Senate Seat   That's right.  Somehow, by using an actual politician, they  worsened  their chances.  Lincoln would have problems against Obama, unless it comes out that he eats infants or something.   And I'm pretty sure he doesn't.   The Republicans are actually going to spend money on this race, and more power to them.  Although eventually Keyes is going to get tired of being the official Sacrificial Lamb for black conservatism and roll up on some fools.   Item : During the last State of the Union address,  urlLink Bush told us that "Americans are safer" and that the world is "taking a turn for the better" .  You might also remember the whole "Americans are safer" thing being a big talking point pre-DNC.  Well, all we've heard ever since the end of The Great Hope Hype has been about  urlLink how we are not safe at all.   I understand that certain things must be said in the service of politics, I get that.  But I really wish he would only try to sell me on one thing or the other, not both.  It is continually this strange dichotomy of the Armageddon Dutch expected and new sunshiney morning he foretold.  But it is important to remember that we are in danger, so we won't focus on the fact that the jobs market is in the dumper. Words have been tossed around in this forum like "unemployment" and "jobs record", and in some cases I have been remiss.  In some instances when I have said "unemployment" I've actually meant  urlLink "underemployment".    Sure, some jobs have been created and what we've been told hasn't entirely been a lie, but more a lie by omission.   urlLink So last week's news that the jobs market sucks was not a huge surprise to me, but to some people I imagine it was.   In Canadian news,  urlLink God has beset the Great White North with a plague , yea, and all shall perish and the trees shall burst from their untapped maple syrup.   urlLink And West Africa too.  But without the syrup.   In conclusion, Iran is not only making nuclear weapons again but is also  urlLink sending weapons to insurgents in Iraq.   I'm not going to say that this is a possibility but just brazenly claim it is actually happening, because why wouldn't it?  Also,  urlLink this is one of the most bizarre things I've ever read .  Its about the Bushes going to church.

      We made the mistake of going to see a movie on a Friday night.   As soon as we sat down, the people behind us (obviously gesticulating wildly during their in-theater cell phone conversation) spilled Coke on Diana. Also, this same group of people were all apparently afflicted with muscle spasms, causing them to kick the backs of our chairs uncontrollably.   The people in front of us had some very urgent business that needed immediate attention, and this business had to be discussed in Asiental as loud as possible. The only English I heard was "Call me back in five minutes - the movie is starting."   The people to the left of us on our row seemed to be high school kids without any sort of social sense at all. They were awesome and wished everyone to know it. Destruction Of Everyone Else's Ability To Watch The Film was the Prime Directive, paramount only to Directive Two: Incite Homicidal Rage. Tertiary Directive: Smuggle In Beers And Hide Them In The Men's Bathroom had already been accomplished.   There was the one guy - in sports you'd call him the ringer - that would wait until everyone in the theater had reacted to something, and then hilariously over-react to it, as if to point out to all of us that he felt like we did, only 2 The X-Treme. He also downloaded and tested ringtones on a cell phone who's screen appeared to be powered by the brightness of a child's dreams and all the wishes missed by fairies, because it was brighter than the actual movie screen.   During any music they would dance, hoot, and holler. After any action they would talk loudly amongst themselves in some youth-tard pidgin based on syllables crafted with a defined lack of parenting, upbringing or consideration. Just like organic food, what gets left out is as important as what goes in. When asked to be please be quiet, please, they readied indignant dirty looks of self-righteousness that deliver nothing more than the humble message of "Go fuck yourself, I am entitled to the ruination of your every enjoyment."   After the film was over I headed to the bathroom to wash my hands and assure myself that not going to jail was the best idea. I saw the dipshits from my row theater-hop into The Notebook, of all films. The Leader had scored a brew somewhere. I get into the bathroom and go into the stall.   And lo, in front of me, I beheld two sixers of beer, resting on the back of the toilet, one missing from the set on the left. They have been hastily wrapped in brown paper hand towels and left there for safekeeping while the young men went see what Sam Shepard and James Marsden knew about love.   I pissed on the beers, on the towels, on the toilet back. I pissed on the floor, hoping one of them might slip in it. It was completely passive aggressive, totally vindictive, and so much fun that trying to tear the paper towels with my urine became a game. I pissed and pissed and pissed and then went out into the Massachusetts night and then home and then to sleep. I slept well.   So, basically, Friday night was a wash.
