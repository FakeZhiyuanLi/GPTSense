      Did you know that the North Koreans are on average only consuming half the calories they need daily?  Did you know the Korean War is referred to as a "war for the liberation of the motherland," not a civil war as Americans and most South Koreans view it?  Did you know that one of the most famous mountains in Korea is called "Baekdusahn"?  And did you know that during 1998-2000, 50,000 youth volunteers used manual tools and removed soil by carrying it on their back to build the "Youth Hero's Road" that stretched from Pyongyang to the western port of Nampo in 700 days?  My friend Sun shared those facts with me after she returned from her 12-day trip to North Korea with a peace delegation.  We know so little about the culture of North Korea and its struggles because U.S. mainstream media only report bad news.  If North Korea is the axis of evil, as Bush called it, how come it doesn't have military bases occupying American soil?  How come the U.S. government continues to interfere with the reunification and reconciliation between the Korean people who live on either side of the 38 parallel?  Let's learn about the beauties of North Korea!  Let's stop the war and promote peace!  Let's stop the hate and spread the love!

      Happy birthday, Carol!  Carol is only a year younger than I am.  Somehow I don't think of her as being 34 and a mother of two beautiful dragon and phoenix twins (a Chinese way of saying boy and girl twins).  Maybe it's because I always remembered her as this beautiful 15-year-old girl who didn't have a care in the world except for having fun.  Yes, the age of innocence.  An African American man died today.  He was in his late sixties.  I don't know him, but he's about the same age as my father.  I wonder if he had a family or not.  I always believe that you can't judge whether someone has lived a successful life until she's on her deathbed or after she dies.  I wonder if he had a successful life.  I definitely doesn't want to die in prison.  Rest in peace, Brother.

      As a gift from  urlLink Nellie Wong , I get a subscription of  Freedom Socialist Newspaper  from Seattle, Washington.  I'm always seeking alternative media.  There's an  urlLink article  by Yuisa Gimeno on the comic fantasy film  urlLink  A Day Without a Mexican   directed by Sergio Arau.  Here's an excerpt from the article: " A Day Without a Mexican  doesn't pretend to give all the answers.  Instead, it uses satire to show how immigrants and Mexicans and all Latinos in the United States are human beings who built and continue to build this nation.  And it is high time that society learned to value their contributions."  Can you imagine this country without any Mexican or other minorities?  For more information on the film and other mind-awakening alternative media, go to  urlLink  www.socialism.com  .

      I received a letter from my friend Alice Waco.  She lost her soulmate of 30 years in February.  Bill McGee was killed on his morning bike ride.  He lived for 79 years as a servant to God and people.  I never had the pleasure of meeting Bill, but we knew about each other through Alice.  Is there such a thing or concept as forever?  Live on, Alice, and celebrate Bill's life.  Besides me, I wonder how many people has  urlLink Ishle Yi Park 's CD  Work is Love  in prison?  Marc dropped off Ishle's CD and zine  Girl Fish  he had borrowed from me.  He said listening to the CD inspired him to write.  I asked him why.  He said the way Ishle made poetry so simple - talking about details of her life - he felt that he could write like that.  He especially likes the poem about David.  Marc said, "It's amazing what she's doing."  He called his mother and ordered Ishle's book of poetry  urlLink  The Temperature of this Water  .  Ishle rocks!  Check her out:  urlLink www.ishle.com   urlLink  Japanese men's gymnastic team - Goooooooold!

      Sunday night's dinner menu: - mixed green salad (4 oz) - individual dressing (2 each) - baked chicken (1 each, 5 oz) - mashed potatoes (5 oz) - chicken gravy (2 oz) - seasoned broccoli (4 oz) - bread, wheat (2 slices) - sherbet, orange (3 oz) - chilled punch (8 oz)  Sounds delicious?  I give it a B+.  The salad turned color and the broccoli was mushy from overcooking.  "Chicken on the bone," as prisoners call it, is the most popular meat in the entire California prison system, excluding those who don't eat meat.

      The weather cooled down a bit.  I decided to organize my letters so that I can send them home.  I treasure every letter my family and friends send me so I save them.  As I was leafing through the letters, I came across a letter from  urlLink Nellie Wong .  In it, she promised me that after I get out of prison she'll make her famous Chinese chicken salad and cook a full Cantonese dinner for me.  She also told me that I'm a poet.  How lucky can I be?!   urlLink The Chinese women volleyball team smashed the American team.

      My friend returned   urlLink How to Get Stupid White Men Out of Office   to me and asked for another book to read.  I gave him   urlLink Norwegian Wood   by Haruki Murakami. Ever since my Guardian Angel photocopied the book and sent it to me, it has passed through six Asians and one African American reader. I'm definitely a Murakami fan.

      Organic farming in prison?  Now that's an idea.  I read an article from where that this lady named  urlLink Catherine Sneed  started an organic farming project in San Bruno jails.  The prisoners were able to grow different produces and give them to the community or sell them.  The project allowed some prisoners to learn farming skills, gave them a sense of accomplishment and productivity, and helped the community.  Such a worthy project should be sprouting in every prison, especially those located in rural areas.  Every prison has vacant land to accomodate an organic garden.  With the lack of jobs in every overpopulated prison, more than half of the warehoused prisoners have nothing to do.  Creating space for organic gardens sounds like a winner to me.

      I'm looking for my friend Alicia Yang.  The last time I saw her was when she came to visit me in San Quentin's Deathrow visiting.  She always shows up when I'm least expecting it and then disappears.  She's constantly moving and searching.  I wonder what she's looking for.  I worry about her and think of her often.  She's a beautiful, intelligent, and compassionate woman.  If anyone knows the whereabouts of Alicia, please let her know that she is missed and loved by many of her friends, especially me.

      My co-worker handed me something he wrote and asked for feedback.  The title of the short paragraph is "A Convict's Introduction."  It's more like a self-promoting ad seeking female companionship.  He's been in prison for nine and a half years on a 13-year attempted murder sentence.  He got locked up when he was 18 and never had a meaningful relationship with a female.  He had asked his friends over the years to hook him up with a friend, but they never came through for him.  With two years left before he paroles, he decided to seek for a female pen pal on his own.  Female companionship is something prisoners all long for.  They don't want to be lonely. Sometimes people are able to develop meaningful relationship because love does not stop at the prison gates.  Of course, the chance of a female writing a stranger in prison just from reading his ad is slim, but not impossible.  Nothing is impossible in this world.  There is a lesson learned through all our connections with people.  I wish my co-worker luck.  In the afternoon, I stepped out of the shower and heard someone call my name.  It's Gremlin (his nickname), a 25-year-old African American.  He asked me, "Is he finished?"  "Who?" I didn't understand his question.  "That dude in the shower," he whispered.   Then it dawned on me.  He was referring to the African American homosexual who was showering.  Gremlin is homophobic.  So I said, "Oh, you mean that human being, the brother, fellow prisoner who's in the shower?"   He said, "Yeah.  I want to shower before all the workers come back." "There're two open shower heads in there," I responded. "I don't want to go in there with him.  I don't get down like that." "You see, that's the same way some people in society look at prisoners.  Oh, they're prisoners.  They're no good.  Lock them up and throw away the key.  What is he going to do to you?" "If he touches me, I'll beat the shit out of him." "Why would he touch you?  He's only taking a shower." I walked away.  Gremlin waited outside the shower until the homosexual got out.

      I received six letters today.  They're postmarked between July 19 and July 26.  I believe the term "snail mail" originated in prison.  A week after my friend Kei visited me, I got her letter saying she was coming to see me.  Why is incoming mail so far behind when outgoing mail is normal?  That's because there's a shortage of staff in the prison mailroom.  There are approximately 6,000 prisoners in Solano Prison.  There are only four people processing all incoming mail.  Every letter must be opened and inspected before its delivery to the prisoner.  Granted not everyone out of the 6,000 gets a letter, but you can imagine the volume of mail the mailroom has to process each day.  Sometimes one or two out of the four staff call in sick, then everything gets backed up.  There used to be eight staff working in the mailroom, but due to the administration's failure to hire people to fill the vacancies, the job positions were eliminated.  The last time i checked it's a violation of federal law to delay the delivery of mail more than five working days.  A couple of years ago, the Postmaster General ordered the prison to process the mail on time.  It got better for a couple of weeks.  Then it's back to the normal program.  During the holiday seasons it's not uncommon for someone to receive a greeting card two or three months late.  The reason the process of outgoing mail is normal is because the prison guards who work on First Watch take care of it.  First Watch guards work from 2200 hour to 0600 hour.  Since they only sit around and count three times during the night, part of their job is to process outgoing mail for the building they work in.  THey inspect each letter before sealing it and putting it in a mail bag.  Well, at least the mail going out is on time.

      I stayed indoor to escape the blazing sun.  I propped my rolled-up cotton blanket and pillow against the wall on my bed and kicked out seven letters.  Sunday is a good day to catch up on responding to the many letters I receive during the weekday.  I also did my laundry.  I washed two blue shirts.  I’ll have to pay someone to iron them for me.  after being in prison for 18 years, you would think I’d learned how to iron.  I didn’t.  there was no need for me to learn how to iron because I can always pay someone to do it.  Ah, the power of having money.  The going rate for ironing a shirt is two Top Ramens, the equivalent of 40¢.  There are plenty of guys who had mastered the trade of ironing to make a hassle.  There are many people who don’t have family friends to support them.  They have to find a creative means to survive while in prison.  I don’t mind paying someone a dollar to iron a couple of shirts.  It’s a fair trade.  I’m sweating.  It must be 90° inside the building.  There is no air conditioning.

      It’s Saturday. The sun is beaming and warming up as expected for any normal summer day.  What do the average people do on a gorgeous day?  BBQ, picnic, shopping, hiking, go to the beach, do yard work, or just chilling.  For my sister, brother-in-law, and guardian angel, they visited me in prison.  They were surprised at how smoothly they got processed to see me this time.  It only took them an hour instead of two.  The first thing that came out of my sister’s mouth was “How come you’re skinny?”  Somehow I keep in hearing the same questions whenever my parents or sister see me.  They came to the conclusion that I’m skinny based on my appearance: a sharp face and small forearms.  My answer has always been “I’m not skinny.  I’m healthy.”  They just don’t know.  How I wish I could just peel off on them so that they can see what I’m working with under my clothes!  If they could only see me through the admiring eyes of my peers who have seen me without my clothes.  They would ooh and ah with envy and admiration just like them.  At 5’8” and 157lbs, I’m sporting an 8 pack of chiseled abdominals, two softball-sized knots called biceps, striation line my deltoids, chest, and back like the characters in a Chinese kungfu comic book.  My flaring lats and 30” waist form a V-shape that any designer suit would be happy to hang on.  On a windy day, I feel like I could extend my wings and fly.  My legs, though strong, can use some work.  Believe me when I say I’m not skinny.  I enjoyed hours of quality time with my loved ones in a visiting room.  Hello world, here I am!  Get ready for Eddy Z.
