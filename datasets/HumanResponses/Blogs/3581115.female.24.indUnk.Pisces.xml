      Why is it one day your man can be perfect then next day hes annoying the crap out of you?  Hubby has just cracked the craps because we aren't going away this weekend we planed to NOT go away a few weeks ago as we couldn't afford it so I planned that we would go out with friends on saturday night instead but oh no we can't do that we cant afford to BAH he is such a pain in the arse some days. I now feel guilty that we arent going away to this stupid rally cause hes made me feel that way and thats WRONG. Is it wrong that I dont want to spend over 4 hours in a car to some dusty crap hole to spend my long weekend?   GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR I thinks hes PMSing lol
