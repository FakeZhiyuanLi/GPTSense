      One of my biggest downfall is that I'm too emotional. I realized this today, right now, before I logged on. My "being emotional" is causing a big problem. You don't realize how much you love someone until they're gone. Ever heard of it? Yeah, it's the famous cliche that you never think you can relate to.. until it happens. No it hasn't happen to me but I feel that I'm getting close and it hurts. I don't want to give up but what if he has? What if he's just "over it"? You know that could be it. I'm all messed up. I should have stuck to the idea that he's too good for me. I told him from the beginning that I'm no good for him but he wouldn't listen. He just wanted what he couldn't have and now he has it he doesn't want it. Why? I'm mean, why do people function like this? I have to admit, I don't exclude myself from this terrible disease. But why? Why do people always want what they can't have? Because it's challenging. That's it.  I need some alone time. Some time to think things through. When I told him yesterday that the longer we are together the more scared I get, I did mean the more scared I get to lose him but as I was thinking today, I think I am scared. I don't know of what because I've been wanting this for so long now. After I got baptized, this just became more real than ever. This is it Antoinette. This is all for real. No joke. So what's so scary about that? I guess this is what they call cold feet. This is the time that the questions start rolling in. Do I really want to tie down so soon? Can I help make it work FOREVER? Will the love last FOREVER? Do I really love him? Does he really love me? Is this really love? Are these even questions you bring up in a deep, deep conversation? Am I being too emotional? I need some alone time. Some time to think things through because this is for real. No joke. I want to do the right thing because deep down inside my little heart, it sure feels like the right thing.
