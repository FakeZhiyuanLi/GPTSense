      Also from PW Daily, an interesting & sad note from the world of bookstores...  After 34 Years, A Sad Ending For Ruminator  For 34 years David Unowsky has attended to the complicated business of running an independent bookstore. There were the happy tasks--hosting authors, handselling literary gems, serving a community of passionate readers--that came with owning one of the best-loved bookstores in the country. And, more and more over the past few years, there were the not-so-happy tasks--hunting for funding, watching the debts pile up, scrapping for ways to stay solvent--that came with owning a failing business.  But Unowsky's life has suddenly gotten simpler. "I'm looking for a job," he said. "Someone might hire me to manage a bookstore. I have 34 years of experience."  At the end of next month, Unowsky, 62, will permanently close the doors on his store, Ruminator Books in St. Paul, Minn. He has no choice. On Friday, his landlord and neighbor, Macalester College--to which he owes more than $500,000--served him with an eviction notice. This final blow came after he spent his retirement savings, mortgaged his house and piled up a $100,000 balance on his credit card to keep the store going. Personally on the hook for some of the more than $1 million the store owes to creditors, Unowsky plans to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He is not just out of business; he is broke.  It is a sad end to an entrepreneurial career that began in 1970, when Unowsky opened the store under the name, Hungry Mind (he sold the name in 2000 and renamed his store). Hungry Mind earned a reputation as one of the few truly fine bookstores in the U.S., often mentioned alongside such greats as City Lights in San Francisco, Elliott Bay in Seattle and Tattered Cover in Denver.  Unowsky admitted that, like many independent booksellers, he's always been more focused on books than profit. But he traced the financial problems that led to the store's closing back to his decision four years ago to open a second store in Minneapolis. In hindsight, he said, he realizes the location was too isolated to sustain a bookstore. The store lost money for three years until it closed.  Struggling with debt, Unowsky fell behind on his payments to Macalester. Her tried a number of tactics to get back on course. Late last year he sold stock in his company, $1 a share for a minimum of 250 shares. He got enough takers to affirm how much book lovers treasure his store--but not enough to cover his debts. He abandoned the stock idea and gave the investors their money back.  Around the same time, he got help from some prominent authors, including Neil Gaiman, Oliver Sacks and Margaret Atwood, who donated items to be auctioned off on eBay to raise money for the store. Then, the horizon seemed to brighten considerably when a financial backer stepped up to negotiate directly with the school.  Those discussions dragged on for months, ending last week with the school demanding that Ruminator Books leave the property. "I'm evicted," the bookseller said. "This isn't my decision. I thought we had a deal with the college and we were going to go forward."  But David Wheaton, Macalester's vice president and treasurer, said they were never able to come to an agreement on future terms or dealing with the store's past debt. "We had gone on for a long time and had been looking for a way to bring the discussions to a decision," he said.  "I think that the store's been an important part of the campus community and the larger literary community for a long time," Wheaton added. "This is not something that we approached or did lightly, and I think it will be a loss for our campus and the neighborhood."  He's not the only one who thinks so. News of Ruminator's imminent demise has provoked the usual laments from writers and readers, who laud the store as a literary oasis in an increasingly shallow and commercial culture. Unowsky must be warmed by such praise. What he really needs now, though, is a steady paycheck.  "I'm 62 years old," he said. "I'd be happy to work for someone else--to work hard for someone else--and go home at night and not worry about making payroll."--Karen Holt

      Here's the word on Harry Potter number six from Publisher's Weekly---You can get a 30 day free subscription to their PW Daily for Booksellers and othe electronic newsletters...  Harry Potter and the Next Book Title  It's been one year since Potterphiles devoured Book Five, and no doubt devoted fans have already seen the third and most recent film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, released earlier this month, multiple times. So with a long summer holiday underway, people are wondering--what's next?  Today fans got a taste. J.K. Rowling has revealed via her Web site that the title of Book Six is Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. She has already noted that neither Harry nor Lord Voldemort is the half-blood prince of the title.  Rowling relaunched her site earlier this year to give herself a place to dispel the many Harry rumors and to update fans about her writing. She planted hints about the sixth title there, but a hoaxer simultaneously posted information on a fan site that offered up a different, false, title.  For those keeping track, Rowling said she is making progress on Half Blood, though she is not finished and no publication date has been announced. In the meantime, fans will have to make due with the paperback of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, to be released by Scholastic on August 10, and the knowledge that production for the fourth film--expected in November 2005--is underway.--Shannon Maughan

      I know it's been a while since I posted anything new so I thought I'd write a short update on why.   I've been immersed in about 5 books simultaneously, two of which I should wrap very shortly. For the curious, the books are:   --Adam of the Road, a young adult book and Newberry medal winner --Lake Effect, a memoir of growing up on Chicago's northern lake shore during the 1980s --No Ordinary Time, the story of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt on the home front during WWII --A book on the state of the modern publishing industry by Jason Epstein, a longtime Random House editor. (He worked with Bennett Cerf when Cerf still co-owned the house, that's how long time.)  --Booknotes: American History  Dilettante-ish? Perhaps. Certainly not the most efficient way through books though, truth be told, that NOT is getting the abundance of my time.   I will continue to review more on the list of books to be reviewed and have several to add to that list as well. Some, having been read so long ago, require at least a refresher so that I don't misstate my real thoughts.   I also have obtained two copies of "My Life" by the President. If I can figure a way to attend the July 1, 2004 signing at Barbara's at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I will do so. The requirement is the purchase of a book, for which you obtain a ticket. I've not checked lately to see if those are still available. In any event, whether you turn the page or not, for reasons I presume I need not explain, I recommend buying the book. Its important, for many reasons.   Happy Reading.   Seth

      The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown Doubleday Books (Random House) 2003  A runaway bestseller, "The Da Vinci Code" marks the return of Professor Robert Langdon, a Harvard University symbology professor, called upon to explain the bizarre and gruesome circumstances of the death of Jacques Sauniere, the deeply respected curator of Paris' Louvre Museum, perhaps the most celebrated art museum in the world.   This tour de force is at once a masterful detective story, a glimpse into archeological and theological history, and, perhaps, a political statement about the modern Catholic church. Highly controversial within the church, this book has spawned a cottage industry dedicated to those challenging its highly controversial conclusions. While not denying that this is, in fact, a work of fiction, Brown has taken care to emphasize that the research and history to which he alludes throughout this work are factual.   Reminiscent of a style seen in Jostein Gaarder's book "Sophie's World", Brown lays a  foundation for the importance of symbology through the lectures conducted in Cambridge by Langdon for eager students. These lessons and Langdon’s profound knowledge of art are to prove critical to the later story and both his freedom and life.   Awakened by a persistent concierge after an evening lecture in Paris, Langdon is summoned to the Louvre by Parisian police officials to consult (or so he thinks) in the bizarre death of Sauniere, a noted art historian and symbologist. Police have been tipped to Langdon's presence in Paris as a result of perusing Sauniere's calendar. Discovering that the dead man lay dying from a mortal stomach gunshot precisely when he was to have met with Langdon, police officials are convinced that they have their man. The truth is, of course, far, far more complex.   When the mysterious positioning of the dead Sauniere's body is noted, police cryptographer Sophie Neveu is called on to the case and thus begins the unfolding of this mysterious story, fraught with peril not only to Langdon but to the foundations of Christianity. Langdon and Neveu race against time to unravel the mysterious clues left by Sauniere, struggling to stay one step ahead of the Parisian police and shadowy elements of the ultra-secretive  Opus Dei  organization.  This is a first rate thriller, a murder mystery that offers lessons from Christianity, archeology, art, mythology, and the history of western civilization. Close readers of Harry Potter & the Philosopher's/Sorcerer’s Stone will recognize a famous name lifted from history, likely surprised to learn he was in fact a real person. It is, however, important to emphasize that this IS a fictional work. The careful reader is advised to do considerable background reading and study before taking the history as presented to be factual. Brown does not argue that "Da Vinci Code" is the literal truth and readers ought resist the urge to do so.   When I opened this book, it did not close until I had completed it. A thoroughly engrossing story, a page-turner in the classic sense of the word, there are still elements to fault. The climactic revealing of the mysterious villain was, in my view, predictable, an unfortunate lapse in an otherwise tangled web. In the last few pages, Brown indulges a hint of a developing love story, a budding romance that will bloom, presumably, in his next book. As is so often the case in Hollywood films, that's an impulse he'd have done better to resist.   One cautionary note to potential gift givers and readers: for those who take their Catholic faith and doctrine very seriously and brook little by way of dissent, this book is not for you. This book requires the ability to understand it as a fiction work, not a heretical slap at cherished beliefs. For lovers of historical fiction, however, it is hard to find better than "The Da Vinci Code".   Highly recommended.

      The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World by A.J. Jacobs Simon & Schuster October 2004 release date   On a lazy afternoon, when the pace of work has slowed, tune into NPR and picture in your head the lives of the people to whom those sonorous voices belong. Yes, that's right: New York, shopping for Shiraz, imported cheese, & only the chastest of the extra-virgin olive oils. At home that night, over pasta & Shiraz, with the Miles Davis playing in the background, they will re-construct the Iraq war and virtually every decision made by the present administration since 12:01 p.m. of January 20, 2001. NPR has a certain predictability--in business parlance, they know their market.   If you've spent much time listening to NPR lately, you will likely have come across one of the monologues of A.J. Jacobs, the senior editor of  Esquire  magazine and the author of "The Know-It-All" to be released this October by Simon & Schuster. After a childhood in elite private schools (Dalton), a lifetime of praise from highly accomplished and bright parents, and the privilege of a Brown University education, Jacobs has graduated into the world of celebrity journalism. While pondering the toll of years (and "too much reality television") on his once razor-sharp mind, Jacobs decides to embark upon a quest: he will read the entire Enyclopaedia Britannica, volume by volume, letter by letter. From a-ak to Zywiec.  Jacobs models "Know-It-All" on the structure of the encyclopaedia, touring the reader letter by letter through his quest. This is a laugh-out-loud funny book, or at least its laugh-out-loud funny for the first 150 of its 370 pages. By the latter half of the book, I found a striking tendency towards rather odd anecdotes concluding with the throwaway: "but you get the idea". Perhaps the meta-irony of reading and digesting 33,000 pages. Along the Britannica quest, we meet a gaggle of Jacobses and in-laws. The numerous rendezvous’ with his maddeningly know-it-all brother-in-law, Eric remind me of the pitfalls of writing about family, namely that what you write may lack the softer edge you intend. Eric comes up often and he does not come off the better for the meetings. Unlike Jacobs' quirky and very bright father, Eric mostly just comes off as arrogant and, on the rare occasion where he doesn't know something, disinterested. Not charming traits.  In much the same way that Morgan Spurlock's film, "Supersize Me" is a running tale of what a month of McDonald's does to him, "Know-It-All" is a running tale of what a year reading 33,000 words does to Jacobs. Facts are wielded with all the subtlety of a brick in the face. Jacobs manages to join MENSA on the strength of old SAT scores, discovering that MENSANS are rather socially maladjusted folks with employment issues. In good-natured frustration, Jacobs' wife Julie imposes a fine of one dollar for every mention of an irrelevant fact (the only tally Jacobs' offers is $20, but one assumes it must surely have gotten much higher than that). Leveraging his newfound intelligence, Jacobs plots his way to "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" where the truly know-it-all Eric emerges as a lifeline. Efforts to land a spot on "Jeopardy!" are, in true irony, unsuccessful when Jacobs is turned down for having met Alex Trebek, an interview he sought in no small part to brag about his  Britannica  exploit. Oh what a tangled web we weave.   Spending a year reading the entire  Encyclopaedia Britannica  is, as virtually everyone tells Jacobs, a quixotic crusade. Intelligence expert Robert Sternberg dismisses the notion that this effort will actually make Jacobs any smarter. Sometimes the only reason for a quest is...the pursuit itself. In this case, the rabbit hole is rich with stories and observations, about pop culture, about what true intelligence is, about family relationships, about patience (Jacobs' wife is nothing if not that), and, of course, the fact that Rene Descartes liked cross-eyed women.   To be released in hardcover October 2004-Highly recommended

      King of the Mountain: The Rise, Fall, and Redemption of Chief Judge Sol Wachtler by John Caher Prometheus Books 1998  The German philosopher and writer Arnold Schopenhaur once advised: "Write the way an architect builds, who first drafts his plan and designs every detail."  Memo to John Caher: read Schopenhauer. Then, try again.  In 1992, at the summit of his power as Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state of New York, a court once led by legendary jurist Benjamin Cardozo, Sol Wachtler was arrested and charged with a series of crimes for his harassment and, though he chafes at the term, stalking of one-time mistress and Republican fund-raising ATM Joy Silverman. Ultimately, this is really a story of one man's rise and then his fall. Redemption has yet to come to Judge Wachtler.   That redemption, when and if it comes, will not be from books such as Caher's. Careening from Wachtler's early career, to his fall, with frequent detours through his jurisprudence formed from over 20 years on New York state courts, this book is an organizational mess. Its noteworthy that there are no review blurbs on the back cover, a frequent, if not immutable, sign that maybe this pup needs once more through the editing mill.   Disorganization, though, is not the chief problem with "King of the Mountain". This book suffers another more serious problem: Caher has written a piece of advocacy. Working with Wachtler's full cooperation, Caher has written what amounts to a speculative apologia for the judge. He condemns the aggressive nature of the FBI pursuit (indeed, FBI Director Sessions had personally intervened following Silverman's call to her), feminist silence in the face of the charges, and speculates about the motives of then senior US Senator Al D'Amato. Caher is not wrong to make these queries, but might have exercised caution to have done so with more detachment and research.   Federal prosecutions are, indeed, often extraordinarily aggressive. That Silverman obtained preferential treatment upon reporting Wachtler's bizarre harassment (e.g., using disguises and voice alteration devices) seems beyond doubt. Silverman had, after all, raised and donated so much money to the Republican party and worked on behalf of the Bush/Quayle ticket so doggedly she received a nomination to be an ambassador, a nomination later withdrawn when Maryland senator Paul Sarbanes pointed out that Silverman had not attended college and had no diplomatic experience or credentials whatsoever. Caher, however, takes to quoting sources who felt troubled by the aggressive nature, rather than undertake a serious journalistic inquiry into the federal case.   Noting Wachtler's often ground-breaking decisions of benefit to women, Caher condemns feminist organizations for their silence. He neglects, however, to point out that 1993 was not a time to be seen taking the side of a Chief Judge who had penned letters threatening to kidnap a fourteen-year old child (Silverman's daughter) and to expose her to dirty photos of her mother and her lover.   Finally, Caher questions the motives and ethics of New York senator Al D'Amato. Certainly not counted among the more ethical and clean public officials ever to win public office, D'Amato did indeed have much to gain from Wachtler's downfall. On the verge of a run for Governor in 1994, Wachtler owed little to the state party apparatus of which D'Amato was the titular head. Indeed, his handpicked choice, George Pataki, then a little known state senator, went on to defeat Mario Cuomo in his bid for a fourth term and remains New York Governor to this date. As prosecutor Michael Chertoff, later to win appointment as Banking Committee counsel, a Senate committee chaired by D'Amato, pointed out, however, Wachtler was on trial because he DID in fact harass Silverman. That a quid pro quo existed between the prosecutor and the Senator, while not implausible, is purely speculation of the sort a serious journalist is best advised to either avoid or scrupulously document. Caher does neither.   Biographers often spend considerable time with their subjects, if not in person, then certainly with their papers, their works, and their friends and colleagues. In this instance, Caher had the benefit not only of that, but also of time spent interviewing Chief Judge Wachtler. He is not the first biographer, nor will he be the last, to become close to his subject. Objective biography, however, requires just that: objectivity. This  is a paen for the legacy and redemption of Sol Wachtler. John Caher is not the guardian of the former nor, as a biographer, the appropriate seeker of the latter.

      Sixpence House : Lost in a Town of Books by Paul Collins Bloomsbury 2003  "It is a horrible dilemma; the frustrating thing about failed books by talented writers is that they have wonderful passages in them that will never be salvaged, never raised from the watery depths of obscurity."   Thus does author Paul Collins describe a fate his third book, "Sixpence House", published by the widely respected Bloomsbury house will surely not suffer. With his wife and year and a half year old son Morgan in tow, Collins moved (from San Francisco) to the Welsh town of Hay-on-Wye, a border town between England and Wales where 1500 residents are served by 40 bookstores. This is a funny and colorful portrait of a town that has made its mark in the book world since the self-declared King of Hay, Richard Booth set up shop in 1962 and determined to re-make Hay as a bookselling capital.   There is, as Nicholas Basbanes has written in his trilogy on the book world, a certian mania to book people. Collins is clearly among the afflicted and Hay proves a wonderful setting from which he can offer observations on books, on their seeming impermanence, and the role they play in our lives. A town so focused and devoted to one industry, Hay offers a rich diversity of characters. Booth is a genuine eccentric, a self-declared anarchist who is always shipping in more and more books, constantly hiring locals, and creating a burgeoning town industry. Collins learns during the course of his time in Hay that many of the town shopkeepers learned the book trade from Booth. Along the way we meet Diana, the keeper of the town's only store to focus on new books. Hay is almost exclusively used and antiquarian in its book orientation. At the Hogshead, while attempting to review the latest proof of what would become his first book, "Banyard's Folly: Thirteen Tales of People Who Didn't Change the World", Collins is treated to a barely potable cider from a chatty and persistent elderly bartender.   Oberservations on Welsh life and the differences between an American and English/Welsh existence are adeptly illustrated through Collins' long (and ultimately unsuccessful) attempts to purchase a home. Agents, it turns out, represent sellers and there are no obligations to reveal what one chooses not to reveal. The differences are not merely cultural, but also of urban versus small town living. Homes in Hay can be 400 years old, with all the good and the bad attendant to that. Likewise, in such a small town, one glimpses the almost certain reality that everyone knows everyone else, may have worked for them, and, at least in Hay, knows the hidden secrets of their homes and buildings.   Collins has a wonderful informal style and tells of a funny and interesting time in the life of his young family. "Sixpence House" lets Hay shine through and should be on the short list of anyone contemplating an idealized escape from the modern urban bustle. This is precisely the sort of book one can imagine Adam Gopnik's "Paris to the Moon" having been, had Gopnik placed more trust in his subject, Paris, and had he restrained his urge to grind axes. For a lover of books and good rich memoir, "Sixpence House" is a delight.

      May 27, 2004 Roger W. Straus Jr., Book Publisher, Dies at 87 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   Roger W. Straus Jr., the brash and opinionated grandee who presided for nearly six decades over the book-publishing company that bore his name, the last surviving representative of the age of independent houses owned privately by gentlemen of literary taste, died Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He was 87 and lived in Manhattan.  The cause was pneumonia, said his son, Roger Straus III.  With its distinguished list of authors and its course set almost entirely at the proprietor's discretion, Farrar, Straus & Giroux — as it was known for much of its existence — approached uniqueness as the conglomeration boom swept through the publishing trade in the 1960's and 70's.  "It's an object of great curiosity," an industry member told The New York Times in 1978. "Very rare — like an antique spinning wheel or a nickelodeon." But even Mr. Straus finally acknowledged the squeeze of market forces on his specialty shop. He sold the company 10 years ago to a European media giant, though he remained largely in charge.  Mr. Straus, whose East Side town house doubled as one of New York's premier literary salons, was never shy about speaking out on behalf of his publishing style. He would say of the conglomerates that they were "being run by accountants, businessmen and lawyers who have very little concern for the book." He concluded, "They could just as well be selling string, spaghetti or rugs."  He was equally critical of what he considered the overhyping of books, of book awards in the United States, of the state of book reviewing and of what giant bookstore chains were doing to the marketing of books.  "Most publishers seem like wallpaper," he told Publishers Weekly in 1977 in response to a question about his outspokenness and availability to the press. "Most of them today are either promoted bookkeepers or ambitious men and women who care only for power and couldn't care less what they actually publish." He concluded, "If publishers don't say much, it's probably because they don't have much to say."  He often backed up his words with action, resigning from the Association of American Publishers in 1978 to protest what he saw as its accommodating response to mergers, supporting the formation of a writers union in 1982, and dismissing Philip Roth, one of his most prestigious writers, from his list when an agent demanded what he considered too large an advance.  Even when his actions seemed at odds with his philosophy, he could take bold steps. In 1965 he signed up Sammy Davis Jr.'s autobiography, "Yes, I Can" (and edited the manuscript himself), because even though the book did not fit into his elite list, he saw that it would rise to the top of the best-seller lists, which in due course it did.  In 1994, when he recognized that his house could no longer compete financially as an independent in a world of conglomerates, he sold Farrar, Straus to one of the foreign media companies he so scorned, Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, in Stuttgart, although, as he insisted in the wake of the deal (reported to have brought him more than $30 million), the arrangement was such that for all practical purposes FSG remained independent.  Farrar, Straus & Giroux began as Farrar, Straus & Company in 1946 with a small list of historical novels and nutrition manuals and grew into the leading publisher of literary heavyweights and prestigious best sellers.   Even a sampling of its authors amounts to an international roll call of literary book award winners and brand names:   Joseph Brodsky (Nobel Prize and National Book Critics Circle Award), T. S. Eliot (Nobel Prize), Nadine Gordimer (Nobel Prize), Robert Lowell (Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award), John McPhee (Pulitzer Prize), Bernard Malamud (Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award), Czeslaw Milosz (Nobel Prize).  And Flannery O'Connor (National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award), Philip Roth (Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award), Isaac Bashevis Singer (Nobel Prize and National Book Award), Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn (Nobel Prize), Susan Sontag (National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award), Edmund Wilson, Tom Wolfe (National Book Award), Marguerite Yourcenar.  On a given evening in Mr. Straus's heyday, a few of his authors might gather with other writers at his town house surrounded by members of the press and publishing industry to celebrate another book publication. Mr. Straus would move among them, resplendent in cravat and pinstriped suit and cufflinks, addressing even casual acquaintances as "Baby" or "Darling," regaling them with gossip in his nasal drawl or confiding in them some expletive-studded anecdote about one of his less favorite people — a rival publisher or a literary agent or reviewer — on whom he had pinned some derogatory tagline.  There, at a typical cocktail reception, you could see Edmund Wilson feeding canapes to the Straus family poodle, Mister Schwartz, or, at a black-tie dinner party after which the ladies and gentlemen would retire to separate rooms, you could hear Philip Rahv, the editor of Partisan Review, heaping imprecations on some contemporary writer or another.  Was there a connection between Mr. Straus's skill at schmoozing and entertaining, and the distinction of his list? Absolutely! many of his authors would insist. He was always available, they would point out. "They treat me well," Isaac Bashevis Singer once said in a tribute to his publisher, "and if I have to ask a question, I can call up the big boss."  He was attentive. By staying in close touch with his stable of writers, he concerned himself not only with their work but also with their lives. When Charles Jackson, the author of "The Lost Weekend," took an overdose of sleeping pills while a guest at the Straus home, he packed him off to the hospital and tended his recovery. When another of his writers became seriously ill, he went about secretly raising money from mutual friends to help pay medical expenses.  And he talked straight. When John McPhee, who was close to Mr. Straus for some four decades, once asked how much money he was losing by not having an agent to negotiate for him, Mr. Straus replied, "Oh, not a whole hell of a lot." When Mr. McPhee thought to request an advance for one of his books, Mr. Straus turned him down with a profanity.  More important, however, Mr. Straus looked after the books he published. Because he remained independent so long and thus had less working capital than did his conglomerate rivals, he might have paid smaller advances against royalties to his authors (except when in 1971 he paid $450,000 for the English-language rights to the Solzhenitsyn's novel "August 1914"); he might have sold their books' subsidiary rights in advance of publication, thus lowering his risk; and his office fronting on Union Square might have seemed almost pretentiously down-at-heels. (Tom Wolfe once described how the drug deals and assaults out front came to a "momentary but deferential halt" each morning as Mr. Straus's Mercedes pulled up to the building.)  But he designed his books attractively, marketed them intelligently and kept them in print forever (albeit sometimes in small supply, or so his authors occasionally complained). He stuck with writers whose first few books did not sell well (and was often enough rewarded for doing so, as in the case of the modestly selling Mr. McPhee, whose 13th book, "Coming Into the Country," soared onto the best-seller list).  He actively courted the writers of so-called midlist books, generally shunned by other publishers. And in the cases where he eventually had to remainder a book, he paid its authors a royalty on the sale, the first American publisher to do so.  He busied himself with every aspect of his business. Despite his reliance on a stable of outstanding editors, he read manuscripts, sat in on editorial and sales meetings, and involved himself in the sale of subsidiary and international rights. In short, he made all the major decisions, both editorial and financial, that went into publishing each book.  Such was the appeal of Mr. Straus's way of doing business that Scott Turow, the author of best-selling legal thrillers, was moved to accept an advance of $200,000 from Farrar, Straus for his first novel, "Presumed Innocent," rather than another publisher's $350,000, because Mr. Straus "had published more of the books I admired than any other publishing house."  Roger Williams Straus Jr. was born Jan. 3, 1917, the second of three children of Roger W. Straus, the president of the American Mining and Smelting Company, and Gladys Guggenheim. His father, of the Straus family that ran Macy's after 1896, worked for his father-in-law, David Guggenheim, who as well as owning a copper mine was a philanthropist. Mr. Straus's paternal grandfather was Oscar S. Straus, former United States ambassador to Turkey and Secretary of Commerce in President Theodore Roosevelt's administration.  Reared in comfort that he described to The New Yorker as "semi-formal" — home on Park Avenue; weekends with grandparents in Purchase, N.Y., and in Port Washington, on Long Island — Mr. Straus proved an indifferent student, to the disappointment of his demanding father. Attending St. George's School in Newport, R.I., instead of the more estimable St. Paul's, and leaving after his junior year because he found being a Jew there mildly uncomfortable, Mr. Straus went on to Hamilton College (instead of Princeton, his father's alma mater), from which he also neglected to graduate.  Inspired by summer work he had done for The White Plains Daily Reporter, he transferred after his second year at Hamilton to the school of journalism at the University of Missouri. The next year, in June 1938, he married a childhood friend he had begun dating in the interval between Hamilton and Missouri, Dorothea Liebmann, the granddaughter of the founder of Rheingold brewery and a student at Sarah Lawrence. Their son, Roger Williams Straus III, was born in 1943.  In addition to his wife and son, Mr. Straus is survived by three grandchildren.  After Mr. Straus graduated from Missouri in 1939 (he received an honorary D. Litt. in 1976), the couple moved back to New York City. With the security of their two trust funds to support them, he went to work as a reporter for the White Plains paper and left after two years to take a job as an editorial assistant at Current History magazine. In his spare time he began to package books for G. P. Putnam's Sons, among them "War Letters From Britain," a successful collection of first-person accounts of the London blitz he put together with the British writer Diana Forbes-Robertson.  When the United States entered the war, Mr. Straus was invited by a playboy friend, James Van Alen (who later invented the tiebreaker in tennis), to join him in running the New York office of the Magazine and Book Section of the Navy Office of Public Relations. For the duration of the war, Mr. Straus wrote speeches, gave clearance to reporters traveling overseas and approved magazine copy. He rose to the rank of lieutenant.  Following the war, after determining that he preferred book publishing to journalism, he decided to start a company of his own. His father put him in touch with Charles Merz, then the editorial page editor of The New York Times. Merz in turn introduced him to John Farrar, who had co-founded Farrar and Rinehart in 1929 but did not return to the company after the war. Farrar agreed to become a founder of Farrar, Straus & Co. in 1946, with $30,000 of Mr. Straus's inheritance, $70,000 from Van Alen (whose parents reportedly didn't want his name to appear as a partner because Mr. Straus was a Jew) and $50,000 from several other friends. The company began operations from Mr. Straus's Naval office for rent of $1 a year. Mr. Straus was 29.  Although in 1950 the young company was buoyed by the commercial success of Gayelord Hauser's "Look Younger, Live Longer," which sold 300,000 copies in its first year, Mr. Straus found that he didn't have the capital to compete with the more commercial publishers. This confirmed his intention to become a literary house, with the benefit of higher prestige and lower costs.   But since literary agents were unlikely to choose Farrar, Straus over houses like Scribner's, Harcourt and Knopf, he decided to go abroad for material. By doing so he picked up writers like Carlo Levi ("Christ Stopped at Eboli"), Alberto Moravia and Cesare Pavese. These in turn attracted the likes of Edmund Wilson, Shirley Jackson and Marguerite Yourcenar. The plan was working.  The house also grew by acquiring other companies, or "eating other fish," as Mr. Straus put it, "because that's the way it is": Hendricks House (1948), Creative Age Press (1951), Pellegrini & Cudahy (1953), L. C. Page and Company (1957), Noonday Press (1960), Octagon (1968) and Hill & Wang (1971). These acquisitions served the various purposes of bringing in new authors, like Marguerite Duras and François Mauriac, of building up the company's backlist, and of getting Farrar, Straus into children's books, college texts and quality paperbacks.  As the company grew, its name changed, first, in 1950, to Farrar, Straus & Young (after Stanley Young, an original stockholder); then, in 1953, to Farrar, Straus & Cudahy (after Sheila Cudahy, a partner in Pellegrini & Cudahy); and finally, in 1964, to Farrar, Straus & Giroux (after Robert Giroux, who came over from Harcourt, Brace & Co. in 1955 as editor in chief and was promoted to the position of chairman of the board in 1964).  Mr. Giroux, who had run Harcourt Brace's trade division but left because he was concerned about the growing emphasis on the textbook business there, was to attract some of Farrar, Straus's major writers, among them 17 who followed him from Harcourt Brace, including T. S. Eliot, Robert Lowell, Flannery O'Connor and Bernard Malamud. Yet other talented editors played important roles over the years: Henry Robbins, who brought in Tom Wolfe and Joan Didion; Aaron Asher, who attracted Philip Roth, Brian Moore and Arthur Miller; Michael di Capua, who edited Maurice Sendak and William Steig; and Jonathan Galassi, president and publisher at the time of Mr. Straus's death.  But Mr. Straus remained the house's dominant figure. Even his after-business hours were devoted to the care and feeding of his writers, whether that involved entertaining them at home or in restaurants, or traveling abroad to add more of them to his stable, or accompanying them to Sweden to collect yet another Nobel Prize. ("He gives a fake groan and says, `Oh, my God, I have to go to Stockholm again,' " Derek Walcott, one of his many laureates, told The New Yorker.)  His only breaks from his publishing routine were weekends at his country house in Purchase, where in temperate weather he would lounge by his swimming pool with his family and poodle (and often enough an author or two) or play tennis at the Westchester Country Club. The Strauses' devotion to the weekend home, passed down to them from his father's family, was so great that when it burned to the ground in 1985 they built as exact a reproduction of the sprawling structure as they could practically manage.  Such was Mr. Straus's presence in his publishing house that finally no room could be provided for his son, Roger W. Straus III, who after several attempts at working for the company with the idea of eventually taking it over, left the business in 1993 over "philosophical differences," a company news release announced. He now makes his living as a photographer. In the place of his son, Mr. Straus designated Mr. Galassi as his successor as publisher, although the future of the company would ultimately depend on Holtzbrinck's plans.  Yet Mr. Straus's aura remained ambiguous, with the barest hint of intellectual insecurity, "a jock's self-consciousness about his poetic roommate," as Ian Parker put it in a New Yorker profile.  "I don't understand a quarter of what I publish," he once confided to this reporter.  But his protestations were deemed by some of his intimates to be a pose for someone who was actually a sensitive reader and a lover of good prose.  The thrill of discovery never ceased to entice him. "That's why you get up in the morning with a bounce in your feet," he told Mr. Parker. "You've discovered a new author you think is marvelous."  "It's very sexy," he added. "It feels great. It's a triumph."

      Holes by Louis Sachar  Frances Foster Books (Farrar, Straus & Giroux) 1998  An Orwellian work camp for bad children is the setting for Louis Sachar's Newberry medal winning book "Holes". Under the watchful eyes of Mr. Pendanski, Mr. Sir and the feared Warden, each of Camp Green Lake's campers are charged with digging a five foot deep by five foot wide hole every day. Hardly the lush scenery envisioned in the name, Camp Green Lake is a dry, sweltering Texas desert.   Stanley Yelnats has found himself sentenced to Camp Green Lake, wrongly convicted of stealing the sneakers of Clyde "Sweet Feet" Livingston, a major league baseball star. The Yelnats family had been living under a curse since Stanley's great grandfather, "his dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-grandfather", had allegedly stolen a pig from a one-legged Gypsy woman. The hopeful spirit of the Yelnats family had persisted and Stanley's arrest had come, ironically, when he brought Livingston's lost sneakers home to bolster his father's effort to become the first to develop a use for recycled sneakers.   Sachar, whose book "The Boy who lost his Face" wound up 49th on the American Library Association's list of most challenged books of 1990-2000, won no less than five major awards for "Holes". This is a strange and mysterious story. The boys of Group D are a diverse bunch, all sent to Camp Green Lake to be reformed for various misdeeds. Characterized as "Lord of the Flies"-esque in one review, the boys adopt nicknames for each other and create their own rituals for survival. Status is a combination of status, personality, and physical prowess. Zero, for example, may be "one weird dude" and the smallest of the lot, but also among the most powerful and fastest diggers.  As the story proceeds, it becomes clear that this is no mere reform camp for wayward youth and the holes are not merely character-building exercises. The Warden, it turns out, has a much more sinister purpose. Sachar intertwines the lives of his characters and their histories with clever plot twists and a touch of otherworldly magic. Camp Green Lake is an eerie place, not quite of earth. Dangerous yellow-spotted lizards, lethal with their sting, dwell in the holes excavated by the boys. Their guardians a strange and brutal lot--the Warden paints her fingernails with the venom of rattlesnakes.  While "Holes" does address, at least indirectly, the bonding that a group will undergo in brutal circumstances, I did not find, as other observers did, Sachar to be telling a parable about cruelty or human nature. This book was later made into a feature film. I've not seen the film, but find the idea of its adaptation unusual. Its not readily apparent to me that the nuanced and eerie story that is "Holes" would adapt well to the screen. This story would appeal to young readers, particularly boys from about 9-13. While there is some profanity and a bit of violence to which some parents might object, this is, in essence, a story of survival and of character building--the kind not found by digging holes.   Recommended.

      The Devil in the White City by Erik Larson Vintage Books (Random House) 2003  With books like "Isaac's Storm", Erik Larson has become another of the writers like Sebastian Junger ("The Perfect Storm") or Jon Krakauer ("Into Thin Air") to refine the art of popular history. At its best, this genre has found the sublime in the stories that have existed beside us for decades. With his latest book, "Devil in the White City", Larsen has truly managed to find a shining pearl.    It has been twenty years since the lights fell dark at the World's Fair in New Orleans. For millions of Americans, the closest experience we have to a World's Fair is a family trip to Disney's Epcot Center, lampooned in "The Simpsons" (Homer: "Ohhhhhhh, its even boring to FLY over it.") Since the 1851 Crystal Palace Exposition in London, however, World's Fairs were a part of American life for over 100 years. The first, held in New York in 1853, counted P.T. Barnum and muckraking journalist Horace Greeley among its creators. One of the most famous structures in the world, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, was commissioned for the International Exposition of 1889. In 1893, in a bid (yet, it should be noted, to be accomplished) to prove its bona fides to New York City, Chicago won the approval of the U.S. Congress to host the Columbian Exposition, a World's Fair to outdo all World's Fairs.   Industrial Chicago at the turn of the last century is the setting for Larsen's "Devil in the White City", the suspenseful and masterful story of the herculean construction of the Columbian Exposition and the nefarious machinations of one Dr. H.H. Holmes.   Familiar to most Chicagoans as the father of the street grid that makes our city so easy to navigate, Daniel Burnham is a central figure in Larsen's story. Along with partner John Root, believed the creative force behind the design of the 1893 World's Fair, Burnham became the designated czar of the world's fair, coordinating the design, arranging the financing, managing the politics (even then Chicago politics intruded) and recruiting the most talented and leading voices of American architecture into the project. Often criticized today as overly formalistic and rigid, Burnham displayed remarkable skills of persuasion and flexibility as he brought the immense talents of men like Frederick Law Olmstead, creator of New York's Central Park to bear on Chicago's World Fair. To build the famed midway, now a famed part of the University of Chicago, Burnham turned to Sol Bloom, later a New York congressman and one of the fathers of the United Nations. Attractions from around the world, including Wild Bill's West Show, wowed the hundreds of thousands of visitors who flocked to Chicago.  Interlaced with the story of the World's Fair is the story of one who flocked to Chicago, lured by the promise of wealth and opportunity in the then-rapidly developing industrial capital, Dr. H.H. Holmes. An enigmatic and mysterious figure, Holmes was a man of considerable charm and persuasion, who, unlike Burnham, used his powers to feed an unquenchable and venal thirst. As luck would have it for Holmes, the Columbian Exposition would provide a steady supply of young women, eager to escape their rigid former lives for a life of promise and freedom. In the hands of Dr. Holmes, it would be something none would find.  As Larsen himself writes in his introduction, this is a story none would believe but for his careful research and documentation. Larsen paints a vibrant and decadent Chicago, a city gripped by its inferiority complex to New York City and eager to prove itself. Chapter breaks are carefully chosen to build a suspenseful story that unfolds tragically. Larsen has mastered the art of storytelling with "Devil in the White City", a rich urban history that sheds light not only on the story of America's first serial killer, but also the tragic success of the Columbian Exposition, a testament to the pioneering can-do spirit characteristic of America.   Highly recommended--excellent popular and urban history.

      The Debt to Pleasure by John Lanchester Henry Holt  1996  Sociopath: A person with an antisocial personality disorder, manifested in aggressive, perverted, criminal, or amoral behavior without empathy or remorse.  Sociopath: Tarquin Winot, the protagonist in John Lanchester's first foray into fiction writing, "The Debt to Pleasure".   In fact, this is probably an understatment. Tarquin Winot is the  uber  sociopath. Quite possibly the most megalomaniacal fictional character in anything I've ever read, Winot is a charming man of considerable gastronomic and literary accomplishment. Lanchester has generously sprinkled his book with lavish and detailed menus, rich discussions of the history of food, and, as it turns out, some remarkably twisted personal behavior.  Winot, we learn, is of English birth but French affectation. "Debt to Pleasure" is the result of Winot's acquiescence to long-urged pleas to put pen to paper with his observations on food and the palate. Taking note of the contribution to literature and  gastronomie  by Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, Winot explains that he has, of course, resisted the pleas to write as he did not wish to "distract attention from my artistic work." A modest man this is not.   As Winot leads a gastronomic tour through the seasons, he offers tantalizing menus and their fascinating histories, along with his blithe observations about family members, servants, and casual strangers who have an odd habit of not long surviving the encounters. To say more would give away too much, but Winot, as noted above, is as coldly dispassionate a sociopath as one might imagine. In reading this book, I imagined a meal at which Winot sat down to discuss the finer points of cuisine with Dr. Hannibal Lecter, though to his credit, Winot's extracurricular activities do not support his impeccable palate.   For all its delectability, this is not an easy read. Lanchester is a very literate man with considerable skill at choosing the  bon mot . Winot never tires of demonstrating his  talent, his proper breeding, and his encyclopedic knowledge. No doubt for some, this will prove to be a mind-bendingly pretentious book. In reading commentaries offered by others on this book, there proved no shortage of those who found it insufferably elitist and condemned Lanchester's effort. I believe those observations to be off-base and, in fact, evidence of the author's success: this IS Winot's story, Winot's book. That such a creature as Tarquin Winot would write in this style is to be expected, indeed not merely by his choice, but by his compulsion.   In closing his story, Winot observes, in words that masterfully sum up who he is, " Do you know the feeling when...you're left with a sense of incompleteness, of unfinished business, of an itch you can't scratch? And then there's the other feeling...you still can't quite remember what happened to make you feel besmirched, and the only certainty you have now is something to do with a lingering taint."   Lanchester has produced a wonderful novel of impeccable depravity. Highly recommended.

      The Blind Assassin by Margaret Atwood Nan A. Talese (Doubleday) 2000  Canadian Margaret Atwood is one of the most celebrated and decorated fiction writers living today. Classics such as "The Robber Baron, "Cat's Eye", "Surfacing", and her feminist classic, "The Handmaid's Tale" are testament to her remarkable skill with the written word.   In addition to being widely respected and honored, Atwood is prolific. She has published sixteen novels, contributed to non-fiction anthologies, penned children's books, and written almost any many volumes of poetry as she has novels.   Published to considerable critical praise, "The Blind Assassin" is the story of lives of two sisters, Laura Chase and Iris Chase Griffen. After Laura's mysterious death in a suspicious car accident, her experimental science fiction novel "The Blind Assassin" becomes a cult classic, the memory of which is carefully guarded by Iris. A story of dysfunction unfolds, with the death of Iris' husband, strangely found dead on his yacht and her later abandonment of her troubled daughter Aimee. The Chase/Griffen/Prior families are clearly not the Nelsons and do not live in Peyton Place.   For all of Atwood's considerable gifts, however, this story and its denouement are drab and  predictable. That all is not as it seems is evident...but all is not so clever either. And it is a story culled nearly from any daily  newspaper's headlines, in far less than the 500 pages that Atwood takes to tell the story.   Atwood's characters are strong, her scenes vividly painted of a once dominant and elite family, reduced by years and scandal, but while her gift with words is strong, her storytelling gift is oddly absent. By the climax of this story, I found myself having both guessed the outcome and uninterested. Laura Chase, it turns out, is not the brilliant and enigmatic writer of legend, cloaked in mystery since her death. Iris is, in many respects, repellent, having made often poor choices with little note of the consequences.   There is much to commend in Margaret Atwood. Given the weakness of "The Blind Assassin", that's a good thing.

      Paris to the Moon by Adam Gopnik Random House  2000  Monsieur Adam Gopnik parle francais tres bien, meme il ecrit bien. (With apologies for not including the proper accenting: Mr.  Adam Gopnik speaks French very well, likewise he writes well.)  This book left with me much the same reaction I had when I walked out of the State Street Theatre in Ann Arbor having watched Robert Duvall's film, "The Apostle". Both are terrific works in their genres, and both feature main characters who are, in their own unique ways, simultaneously infuriating.   In Gopnik's case, its a case of intellectual and cultural elitism so deep he makes the collective egos of the late George Plimpton, William F. Buckley, Jr., and the late William Henry not merely pale but practically disappear. A native Pennsylvanian, Gopnik has been a writer with  The New Yorker  magazine since 1986. A talented writer and incisive commentator notwithstanding, Gopnik has, if unintentionally, followed the example of British poet Dame Edith Sitwell who once commented, "I have often wished I had time to cultivate modesty. But I am too busy thinking about myself."   "Paris to the Moon" opens with Gopnik and his wife Martha Parker leaving New York City in 1995 for Paris, at least in part to protect his infant son Luke Auden from the corrupting influence (Barney & Game Boys among the villains) of American culture. While denying any pretense of being a Francophile, Gopnik proceeds to fill 340 pages with unfavorable cultural comparisons between the United States and France. Where anachronistic practices and overly bureaucratic goverment institutions persist in France, Gopnik gives them the light treatment of being quaint or a reflection of a simpler time. One can't help conclude by the end of the book that he wishes he'd been born in France and would certainly rectify the error if it were possible.   The strength of this book is Paris, a beautiful and fascinating city with a rich history. When Gopnik deigns to stand aside long enough to let Paris shine through, the anecdotes and scenery glow. Having visited Paris twice myself (in 1982 and 1996), I have walked the same streets, browsed the book stalls along the Seine, and shopped many of the same markets lining the Left Bank. As is the case with any city, the true richness of the Parisian experience is not found by ascending the Eiffel Tower, marvelling at the flying buttresses of Notre Dame, or walking the endless halls of the Louvre. As a transplanted Parisian from 1995 to 2000, Gopnik does an admirable job of portraying the experience of daily life in Paris. The charm of Paris is that it  is  a unique experience: the open air markets featuring fresh produce and meats, the cafes with small cups of strong espresso (coffee as we think of it in the United States is not generally an option), the  brasseries  , the wonderful boulevards for walking, bakeries scenting the neighborhood with the aroma of freshly baked  baguettes  are not tourist gimmicks rolled out to entice Americans but parts of daily life in Paris.   A craft with language is a sufficiently rare gift that it ought be appreciated on its own merits. Recounting the trial of Vichy wartime official Maurice Papon, the battle over the Balzar restaurant, the machinations of  Haute Couture  or writing about the birth of his second child, Gopnik has a lyrical and wonderful storytelling quality. The characters come alive and the scenery comes into view with every page. That he saddles the book with the excessive use of French words (understandable where English equivalents don't exist and generally not the case where he opts to do so), unfavorable comparisons, and name-dropping (Gopnik has not merely heard of Alice Waters, Eugenio Donato, Nicole Wisniak, they are his close friends) is all the more regrettable because what lies beneath is so rich.   Writing about his good friend Wisniak, the head of the magazine  Egoiste , Gopnik comments that she "is a woman of such original chic that in her presence I feel even more ingenuous and American than I usually do, as though pinned to the back of my jacket were a particularly embarrassing American license plate: "Pennsylvania: The Keystone State" or "Explore Minnesota: 10,000 Lakes". In "Paris to the Moon", Gopnik gives life to a vibrant and wonderful city. It is a regrettable that for all his self-consciously hip musings, he fails to grasp that one can love Paris as well as appreciate the vibrancy, diversity, and culture of the wasteland in which he was unfortunate enough to have been born.   A great and infuriating book--recommended.

      The Fifties by David Halberstam  Villard Books (Random House) 1993  How do you write the story of a decade? No small task for a historian. In an earlier piece, I wrote about Joel Glenn Brenner's wonderful history of Mars & Hershey. That undertaking, largely about two companies, absorbed nine years. To tackle a decade seems an almost insurmountable feat.   To accomplish that, David Halberstam in his 1993 book "The Fifties" (it should be noted, the Fifties  in the United States ) resorts to what I'd call vignette history. Having lived through the decade and, in fact, having covered, as a journalist, some of the major stories about which he writes, Halberstam comes to the table with a perspective and an overall sense of the decade. This is simultaneously the greatest strength and weakest point of the book. To write the history of a decade is, it seems to me, to interpret the meaning and significance of that time, its events, and its people. By definition, this would seem to require a length of years, something accomplished with a 1993 publication date. Where this undertaking can get some gauzier, however, is in the interpretation of those observations. Our own biases, persuasions, & ideologies color almost every aspect of how we look at the world and how we interpret what we see. This raises an ancillary but critical question as we read history: what is the proper role for the ideological interpretation of the historian? Consider that Halberstam and Gertrude Himmelfarb would likely come to very different conclusions about the meaning of the decade.  As Halberstam notes in the preface to his book, the fifties has been painted as a decade of traquility, of obedient children, plentiful employment, and domestic peace presided over by the grandfatherly Ike Eisenhower. The reality, regardless of ideology, is of course more complicated. Using vignettes, Halberstam fleshs out a decade which saw the United States evolve from a dichotomous rural v. urban, agriculture v. industry era to a world much more resembling our suburban, strip mall, built for convenience modern country.   Illustrating the evolution of the country with examples drawn from civil rights, business, literature, politics, entertainment, and world affairs, Halberstam paints the picture of a demobilizing country on the move. With thousands of veterans returning to the United States following the end of World War II, the nation faced a pressing need for housing, a need filled by Bill Levitt (and others who followed suit) with the development and construction of what would become America's suburbs. Solid single family pre-fabricated housing popped up, first in what would become known as Levittown, New York and soon all over. To support the new suburban lifestyle, GM began marketing a full line of cars backed by sophisticated advertising campaigns. Families now spending time in suburban homes required things to do: in swept the programming wizards at America's TV stations to fill the gap left by the decline of radio. "Ozzie & Harriett", "I Love Lucy", "Leave it to Beaver", Milton Berle, and the television quiz shows all emerged as hits. To ensure that programs resulted in sales for their corporate sponsors, Madison Avenue emerged in the 1950s as a potent force, creating personalities such as Betty Furness, the Westinghouse Lady. Advertising entered the world of politics in the 1952 presidential election. Sure enough, as demographics, ratings, and product sale demands collided, ethics waned in some quarters, leading to scandals such as cheating on the popular show "21" involving Charles Van Doren, later captured movingly in the film "Quiz Show". To support growing families spending vacations on the road in their new cars, men like Ray Kroc & Kemmons Wilson built empires with companies like McDonald's and Holiday Inn, the latter the result of Wilson's inability to find a hotel to house his large family.   While the economic boom was on benefitting millions, others watched from the sidelines, unable to capitalize on the promise of the new decade. The murder of young Chicagoan Emmett Till horrified the nation and the laser lens of national journalism focused for the first time on southern institutional racism during the resulting trial at which the killers (who would later confess boastfully) were acquitted. Along with the 1953 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education/Topeka, KS, the refusal by seamstress Rosa Parks to move to the rear of the black section of a Montgomery, AL bus (Parks was, at the time, in the black section but in its front row which could be reduced at the discretion of the driver to accommodate whites), the Till murder prompted the emergence of a national civil rights movement, bringing men such as Ralph Abernathy and Martin Luther King, Jr. into national prominence.   For others, the fear of Communism and the activities of Senator Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin created an atmosphere chilling of intellectual and cultural freedom. The political parties, hoist by their own rhetoric regarding the loss of China, the loss of Cuba, and the encroachments of the Stalinist USSR, left little manuever room, resulting in the first broad-scale use of covert tactics, including sponsoring the overthrow of hostile (or, in some cases, allegedly hostile) regimes. Halberstam cites examples of a country in foment with the emergence of Beat writers like Kerouac and Ginsberg, singers like Elvis, social commentators such as Betty Friedan and C. Wright Mills.   One curious omission that ties much of this together is the development and construction of the interstate highway system, a legacy of the Eisenhower years that enabled much of the resulting change in the country to occur.   In the end, we're left somewhat to wonder what the lessons are. Halberstam, while showing clear signs throughout of his own ideological underpinnings, is curiously reluctant to make broad statements about the decade. That the decade was a time of tremendous economic progress and huge strides in American business seems beyond question. While critics today lodge complaints about McDonalds and heavy fuel consumption by American cars, these developments, particularly as they were applied in industry after industry, are net positive. To point out though, that a rapidly evolving society didn't often pause long enough to consider the implications of its changes seems prescient. A suburban home, packed with modern appliances, a Buick in the driveway, playing "Leave it to Beaver" on the television in a society where acceptable political thought generally ran the gamut from A to B was not necessarily the stimulating and challenging environment it might have been.(It was noted that, among Democrats, Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson was quite conservative) That some, particularly women and minorities, would be left out was, if not inevitable, certainly predictable.  "The Fifties" is not a small undertaking--the book runs, exclusive of end notes, 733 pages. As a journalist, Halberstam knows how to write an engrossing history that moves the reader along from chapter to chapter, moving between threads and often treating a discrete story in one chapter, of which there are 46. In four or five instances, I took note of nearly identical language from paragraph to paragraph. It would seem in those instances either Halberstam or his editor missed a point. An engrossing read from an accomplished journalist, this book will provide an illuminating look at a decade of rapid change and far more dislocation than a  Nick-At-Night re-run of "Leave it to Beaver" would have you believe.

      The Emperors of Chocolate by Joel Glenn Brenner Broadway Books, of Random House 1999  "You can't judge a book by its cover" or so goes the adage. If ever there were a book that proves thats slick marketing and a great cover can bring boom sales, "The Emperors of Chocolate" by former Washington Post reporter Joel Glenn Brenner is it.   Both the cloth and trade paperback editions of this wonderful history feature warm Hershey's kisses, coming off the assembly line. Count this as a picture worth 1,000 words and probably a huge chunk of this bestseller's sales. This book, however, is much more than a beguiling cover.   Brenner has paintakingly researched the history of the two giant players in the $20 billion American candy market, Mars, Inc. of McLean, Virginia and Hershey Food Company of Hershey, Pennsylvania. One-time allies in a more gentlemanly era, Mars & Hershey emerge as bitter rivals, fighting over government contracts to provision the US military, market share, and new product release. Among the more astonishing revelations is the cloak of almost complete secrecy that enshrouds the confectionary industry. Invoking the espionage imagery of the Dahl classic "Willie Wonka & the Chocolate Factory", Brenner portrays a world in which even the name of the Mars president will not be revealed to a caller to headquarters. (The co-presidents, to this day, are John and Forrest Mars, Jr., sons of the legendary, brilliant, and tyrannical Forrest Mars, Sr. who, while not the company founder, is assuredly its Godfather). In addition to obtaining unprecedented access to Mars employees, including interviews with the extremely reclusive brothers, Brenner built strong relationships with the Hershey archivist and Hershey executives & employees (both past and present) to paint a wonderfully rich portrait of this industry.   Forrest Mars (born in 1904) and Milton Hershey (born in 1857) emerge as complex men with radically divergent agendas in the construction of their respective empires. Mars was consumed with the desire to build, to be the biggest. He was famous for saying "If you're not first, why do it?" Hershey, never interested in the mechanics of business or finance, was passionate only for a time with product, more determined to build a model city and, at the behest of his wife Kitty, formed the Hershey Industrial School, an orphanage for boys (later to include girls and today one of the richest private non-profit institutions in the world as a result of its control of the majority of stock in the Hershey Food Corporation). Its worth noting that every time one purchases a Hershey's product, the Hershey School is being supported in some small measure.   The stories and anecdotes offered by Brunner are first-rate and weave a wonderful tapestry. To cite just a few examples seems akin to offering just a bite of candy bar, but here goes:   Not only were Hershey and Mars once allies, but Hershey was, until the 1960s, the prime source of chocolate for Mars products.   Mars, to this day, offers virtually no peanut butter based products, preferring instead to repeatedly offer hazelnut products. Why? The Mars family members don't like peanut butter, having grown up on hazelnut in England where Forrest Mars, Sr. struck out on his own, having angrily left his father's Chicago candy company. (Mars, Sr. would later gain control of this enterprise following a bitter family dispute in the late 1950s).   M&Ms, along with Snickers one of the leading Mars products, is half-named for Bruce Murrie, the son of Robert Murrie, Milton Hershey's closest friend and president of Hershey for over 50 years. (The other half, obviously enough, is Mars.)  Among the biggest fights waged between Hershey and Mars: who would win the right to provision the US military with chocolate. Hershey won the fight for World War II, a source of pride to this day among Hershey employees. Mars would win a much-contested fight for the same right during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.   Europeans (indeed, most of the rest of the world) consider Hershey's milk chocolate to be so sour as to be virtually inedible.   During the Great Depression, Milton Hershey refused to lay off a single worker. While profits dropped by half, sugar and cocoa price drops provided some cushion and the company and city of Hershey, Pennsylvania went on to provision US troops during World War II with the Ration D bar, unrecognizable by today's standard of chocolate.   The family-owned H.B. Reese Candy Company, a Hershey neighbor, received free sugar and discounted chocolate during the Depression from Milton Hershey. Upon Reese's death, Hershey would acquire the company and continue the production of the wildly popular Reese's peanut butter cups, their signature product.   When Mars passed up the chance to promote their M&M candy in conjunction with a Hollywood film release, Hershey marketing guru Jack Dowd inked a deal paying $5 million to ensure that Reese's Pieces, then a brand new product, would become the favorite candy of...Steven Spielberg's E.T.  The film went on to smash worldwide box office records, making the Hershey investment a bargain basement bonanza.  What Brenner has accomplished with this book is a to create a wonderful cultural history, informed by the development of an industry. To the reader seeking a book filled with the hard data about the finances of Willie Wonka's world, this isn't it. As Brenner points out, such data is hard to come by. Mars, a privately held company, withdrew from industry trade groups upon Forrest Mars, Sr.'s assumption of control in the 1950s. During his lifetime, he granted one interview. Following publication of Brenner's Washington Post Magazine article on Mars, the family shut their doors to her and, in fact, fired their publicists (who were later rehired). Hershey, while public, is scarcely more revealing of their hard data. Operating for years with a virtual monopoly on national chocolate sales, the company did not even track individual product sales until the head of sales, Larry Johns jumped ship from Mars, only to be shocked at the undeveloped state of affairs at Hershey. No one ever accused Mars of not knowing what their business was, with whom, where and how much. Given this reticence, Brenner's accomplishment is all the more impressive--but hers is primarily a cultural history.   After reading this book, I made a gift of it, along with milk chocolate bars from every company I could find, to a chocolate-loving friend. This is a book that is both tremendously enriching to read and fun. Highly recommended.

      The Sin Eater Author: Gary D. Schmidt Publisher: Penguin Year: 1999  More to come on this when I'm home and have access to the book. The quick and dirty: this book is a masterpiece! One of the best pieces of young adult fiction I've ever read--a wonderfully layered and complex exploration of coping with loss and learning about oneself. Some of the best metaphorical writing I've ever read regardless of audience.   "Ma haunted the house, not because she was somehow there, but because she was so awfully not there."   I've written a bit on this book several entries earlier, but said I'd add a bit. Gary Schmidt, the author of this book, has since written and edited several books in the area of religion, mythology, and poetry. If "Sin Eater" is any indication, those books are probably well worth the investment for a young adult reader. This book, particularly its use of metaphors, is a wonderfully written and lyrical story of loss and grieving.  This story centers on Cole, a boy of about 13, who has just lost his mother after long illness. Cole and his father decide to bring her "home" and relocate to Albion, New Hampshire to live on the farm of her parents. While Cole begins to explore and figure out how to rebuild his life, Cole's father descends into a powerful and black depression. This sounds like a recipe for a downer of a book that would scare off most parents and young readers.   That would be a mistake. Evocative in his use of metaphors and narrative, Schmidt paints a vivid picture of small town New Hampshire and the lives of Cole and his family. Well-drawn characters add a depth and richness to the story. Age old rivalries and family histories explain the title "The Sin Eater". While some critics have faulted Schmidt for lacing two unrelated storylines into one book, that misses the mark. It may be a more apt criticism to say that the book is mis-titled. While the sin eater legend and history adds to the story of Cole's family (and building a history in a time of loss is profoundly what this book is all about), this does seem a bit askew as the title for the book.   This is a terrific read, with some great characters and an upbeat story. Cole experiences some hardcore family tragedy, and it hits more than once, but this book uses those to explore themes of coping and relationships in a very compassionate way.   Highly recommended--difficult to find

      Republic.com Author: Cass Sunstein, Karl Llewellyn Professor of Jurisprudence, University of Chicago Law School and Department of Political Science  Publisher: Princeton Paperbacks Year: 2001, with a revision in 2002  "See only what you want to see, hear only what you want to hear, read only what you want to read."  The internet has produced a wildly diverse array of information outlets, catering to every taste, whim, fetish, viewpoint, and perspective. With the advent of filtering technologies and mass use of personal computers, Sunstein, a provocative scholar on First Amendment issues for years, poses the question: what price is our republic paying for our unwillingness to listen to the voices of those with whom we disagree?   Most news sites today permit the user to tailor their choices very specifically to only see certain subjects. If I choose to only read news clips about Ben Affleck & Jennifer Lopez's impending (or not) nuptials, my daily horoscope, and the latest on how political disagreement with Republican leaders is treason a la Ann Coulter, I can do so. Since we're all empowered to do this with regard to our own personal and political vagaries, where's the problem?   Sunstein makes a very compelling argument that the problem is substantial and getting worse. Prior to her death on September 11, 2001 on flight 175, conservative commentator Barbara Olson decried (somewhat ironically) the nasty turn in American political discourse. While perhaps blind to the contribution to that degeneration made by her two slanderous books, Olson was citing the problem crystallized in Sunstein's book.   Informed decisionmaking in a democracy (or republic, if you prefer) requires an informed dialogue. It asks of us as citizens to listen to the voices with whom we disagree, to consider viewpoints that make us uncomfortable, and to fully and openly discuss possibilities, ramifications, desired results, and our own underlying philosophies that drive our decisionmaking. In a world where we can filter at will and exclude from our sight-line, those viewpoints (and, really, this means those people) with whom we disagree, we short-circuit our decisionmaking and rely on sketchy information that serves only to reinforce what we'd already wanted to do in the first place. We listen, as Sunstein points out eloquently, to louder, more shrill echoes of our own voice. When faced with viewpoints that challenge our assumptions and beliefs, we retreat to the only ground where we can operate, since we've not bothered to be informed: insult, innuendo, slander, & shouting.   Sunstein posits another challenge we face with the advent of mass filtering of news and information. Not only is our decision-making process potentially warped, but our common understanding and societal baseline is damaged. Growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, I got my news (as did almost everyone I knew) from the late Frank Reynolds (later, Peter Jennings), Tom Brokaw, Walter Cronkite (later Dan Rather), the Boston Globe, the New York Times, the Gloucester Times. Eventually CNN and C-SPAN were added to the mix. For earlier generations, that source might have been Edward R. Murrow, Chet Huntley, David Brinkley, Eric Sevareid, or John Chancellor. The fact was, however, that the vast majority of the country had a common baseline about current events and news. That didn't equate to a common ideology or interpretation of that news, but it did provide a common roadmap. Consensus didn't come easy, the two major political parties traded off victory and defeat in elections and on issues constantly, but, while agreement was fleeting, there was a national agenda, a consensus on issues that needed focus, discussion, resolution.   Sunstein would say that the proliferation of media outlets and information sources has some positives. Issues that might not previously have risen to the surface now can get the attention of some portion of the public and be forwarded for discussion. The problem isn't that there are no positives to this change or to techonological advancements but, rather, that we under-estimate the costs. Those who raise concerns about the technology are labeled "luddites" and those who find the ideological/political tailoring troubling are usually hit with the charge that they're simply radical liberals who just can't stand that their hegemony (proven time and again by nonpartisan/non-ideogical studies to be almost totally mythical) over the media has been challenged. Ironically, the accusations serve only to bolster Sunstein's arguments. Our dialogue has proven the old maxim about lawyering: if you've got the facts on your side, pound the facts. If you've got the law, pound the law. If you've got neither, pound the table. We've become a nation of table pounders who don't want to (and now don't have to) listen to those with whom we disagree. A national consensus on issues, problems, and challenges has become elusive.   Sunstein's proposed remedies to address the viewpoint myopia hitting so many of us will no doubt provoke outcry and calls that he is threatening First Amendment rights. Among his proposals is the recommendation that an advocacy website provide links to opposition sites. A holocaust denial group would provide links to the Anti-Defamation League or the Wiesenthal Center. Provocative. Sunstein, of course, acknowledges that whether anyone clicked on the links would be another matter entirely and something entirely and appropriately outside the purview of regulation.   I found this to be an engrossing and very well-crafted book on the obligations of democracy and being a citizen. Sunstein points out that citizenship carries obligations and that living in a republic carries with it a responsibility to be informed. Being informed is more than simply listening to the echoes of our own voice. For anyone interested in public affairs and public discourse, I highly recommend this book. You may not agree with Sunstein's diagnosis of the problem or his prescription for solving it, but it will cause some serious thinking.

      Sons of Liberty Author: Adele Griffin Publisher: Hyperion 1997 National Book Award Finalist  American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults  The awards this book won notwithstanding, "Sons of Liberty" tells a pretty standard story, albeit in a well-written way.   The Kindles are a dysfunctional family with little money in a small town. In what's almost a comic book caricature, George Kindle is a hyper-testosteroned, he-man macho dad who wakes his sons up at all hours for home construction projects, controls his house, and drinks down the street at Maguire's. Not overburdened with too much "book-learnin'", George has little respect for the intellectual and academmic accomplishments of his elder son, Cliff, or his inexplicably admiring younger son, Rock.   Apart from a fascination with the American Revolution, Rock's behavior is such that George isn't called upon often to disapprove of academics. Rock spends most of his time engaged in random acts of petty delinquency with tomboy neighbor Liza, whose father, as she proudly states, is in a band in Skowhegan, Maine (mainly famous as the hometown of Margaret Chase Smith, the first woman elected to the US Senate in her own right). If the book suffers a primary fault, it is that the characters of Rock, Liza, and George are rather one-dimensional. George is a brutish anti-intellectual oaf. Rock, out of some misplaced concept of military style loyalty borne of his obsession with the revolution, fails to see or refuses to see the damage and destruction being wreaked on his family, and Liza simply skips along, acting out in response, one assumes, to the physical beatings she gets from her mother's useless boyfriend.   The mothers here are weak: Rock's is agoraphobic and can barely set foot outdoors, Liza's blindly ignores the beatings that she's seen in front of her own eyes. Younger siblings are largely afterthoughts though there is a chilling scene in which George brutally tosses young Brontie's doll into the mudroom after she has wet her bed (Brontie is all of maybe 4 years old), telling his toddler daughter that because she "can't be good", her dolly "doesn't love" her anymore. To Griffin's credit, with that one scene, she captures the essence of George, a man who should never have fathered children.   The glue in the book and the best developed character is Rock's older brother, Cliff. When Liza opts to run away, escaping their small cul-de-sac and her abusive boyfriend-in-law, it is Cliff who comes up with the plan and sees it through. When its finally time for the Kindles to make a break from George, again Cliff is the one who steps in. Cliff has a maturity and a wisdom beyond the 16 years old or so that he is and a clarity of vision. He understands, as Rock does not, that family loyalty starts first with permitting there to actually BE a family. It is Cliff's patience and support that finally stirs his mother from the George-induced agoraphobia that has kept her trapped in their small, drafty, leaky home. When its time to rescue Rock from the slippery path to becoming a younger version of his militaristic obtuse father, Cliff again steps in.  This book broaches many of the conspiracies of silence that must exist in a dysfunctional home divided. This story has been told many times and I suspect even in young adult fiction, a finer example exists. That said, this is a well-crafted book with a storyline that moves along smoothly. Griffin has put together a storyline that will likely be too familiar to too many. While reading about George, I couldn't help but think of the sports fan fathers pushing their children to be what they were not, with enough venom and abusive language to last a lifetime. Not the most creative of stories, but well-written and, sadly, too common.

      The Young Oxford Book of Timewarp Stories Editor: Dennis Pepper Publisher: Oxford University Press Year: 2001  One of best bookstores I've ever found is Afterwords, a small remainder bookstore on Ann Arbor's Main Street. While this store isn't re-stocked often (something for which I ought probably be grateful), the store carries some of the most intriguing and interesting titles, all at prices that would make most used bookstores hang their heads.   The Young Oxford Book of Timewarp Stories is a find from the recently restocked Afterwords. This is an anthology of short stories that explore concepts and aspects of time travel. There are 21 stories by the famous (Arthur C. Clarke, Penelope Lively, Ray Bradbury) and the not-so-famous. For the hardcore science fiction geek, keep walking, nothing to see here. These stories are more in the realm of fantasy and, in some instances, philosophical musing.   The first story, "My Object All Sublime", by Poul Anderson has a wonderful and sickening plot twist at the end and keeps the crimes of the principal shrouded. It poses an interesting penological question: can you use time to place people where simply LIVING is the worst punishment one can suffer?   Rita Lamb's "What Time is it?" reminded me of visits to my grandmother after her 1986 stroke--her lifelong physical activity and energy turned on her, giving her the physical stamina and strength to survive, a shell of the force she had been, until 1991. On one visit, her irascible roommate had traveled back in time and was a 10-year old girl, desperate to be freed from her safety restraint so she could, as she exclaimed, get home to her mother. Another form of time travel perhaps, and well captured by Lamb.   These stories, and I've yet to finish all 21, are generally brief--about 5-10 pages and Editor Dennis Pepper has done an excellent job of organizing them and choosing selections that move along briskly. Oxford University Press has a deserved reputation for careful editing and wise selection, something borne out here. Anyone intrigued by concepts of time or curious about the world about them will find something to pique interest here. This is a well-crafted and well-assembled book with a great collection of stories.

      Terpin Written by Tor Seidler Published by Laura Geringer Books, an imprint of Harper Collins Year: 1982, illustrations 2002  What would happen if you told the absolute honest truth in response to everything you were asked?   After a white lie to a fellow train passenger produces a shocking and unforeseeable tragedy, young Terpin Taft vows to only act out and speak the truth in his heart. A classmate writes and delivers a book report, one with rough edges? When pressed for his opinion, Terpin answers honestly..and loses a friend.   Tor Seidler has written a fable about being true to oneself with "Terpin" . Seidler, the author of National Book Award finalist "Mean Margaret", has produced an engaging story about an eccentric but sincere character. In another context, Terpin Taft would be seen as an obstinate moralist, unable to bend. Seidler, though, has given Terpin a complexity, an intelligence, and a wholesome sincerity. Terpin isn't telling the truth to offend friends or out of some warped sense of malicious obedience. He truly believes this is the right path for him to follow.   The story moves along--this is a short book at only 106 pages in the library bound edition, but it reaches from Terpin's youth to his adulthood and the very unpredictable twists and turns his life takes as he lives in conformity with his truth.  For those familiar with the illustrations of Chris Van Allsburg, this book is a bit of a treat. The library bound edition features wonderful illustrations added in 2002 by Peter McCarty reminiscent of those Van Allsburg has produced for his wonderful books.

      Welcome to my blog for book thoughts. Back in 1998, a good friend handed me a copy of Ken Follett's book, "Pillars of the Earth" and told me that it was one of the best books she'd ever read. I thought "Follett??!! Of the chest-thumping spy and Cold War novels?", but I persisted...through its approximately 1,000 pages and it was spellbinding. My interest in books and reading was re-kindled and I've spent a lot of the past six years reading and thinking about books. Over the years, thanks to my employment with a big national book retailer, the piles of books grew and grew. I've spent hours perusing bookshelves, shopping in remainder bookstores, and plowing through book after book. Its been a delight and hopefully will remain so for a long time to come. What I'm doing here is sharing thoughts on books. I'm not a professional critic, nor writer. I write mainly about what appeals to me in a given book. Pans will be far rarer than raves. I don't have any subject matter rules either. I will read pretty much anything. A long string of the pieces here focus on young adult fiction, a subject I spent the better part of six months reading. I will post thoughts on new books, on old books, on classics, and on books in pretty much any subject area you can imagine. I do this mainly because my attention span roams pretty wildly. A thread in one book can set off an exploration of a subject (or author) that may last three or four books. With young adult books, I do try to offer insights into whether I think a particular book will resonate with younger people. After all, that's ostensibly the audience, though I think many books make rich contributions regardless of their target audience. Since I'm not a professional critic, I don't spend a lot of time on the mechanics, though there will be exceptions and observations there as well. I've come to believe that authors write their books for as many reasons as there are authors. With that in mind, I think traditional criticism can miss the mark. When I suggest books to friends, as I often do, I'm mindful of their interests, reading style, and, for lack of a better term, their pet peeves. Some books may be linguistic works of art, but I know the style and substance will brook little interest in one friend whereas it may captivate another. Please feel free to share any thoughts, either on what I've said about a book or your own impressions of that book or author. Where one book triggers the "You've got to read this" bug, pass it on. I'm always on the look-out for interesting things to read.   I hope you enjoy your time here. If a book piques your curiousity, check out any of the online booksites for more information. These sites often offer a wealth of information and the thoughts of those far more immersed in the book criticism world than I.   Happy reading!

      By Associated Press Published July 24, 2004, 2:26 PM CDT  LONDON -- "Harry Potter" author J.K. Rowling said Saturday she is expecting her third child. Rowling, 38, made the announcement on her official Web site.  "I am really delighted to say that I am expecting a third baby, who is due next year," she said. "I always wanted three children, so I could not be happier."  Rowling's son, David, was born last year following her marriage to Neil Murray in 2001. She has a daughter, Jessica, from a previous marriage to Jorges Arantes.  The author reassured fans that the pregnancy would not affect the release of the next book in the Potter installment, which will be titled, "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince."  "Let me reassure you that book six remains well on track and, fingers crossed of course, I don't foresee any baby-related interruptions or delays," Rowling said.  "I still can't say for sure when it will be finished, but I have written a lot and I really like it."

      The Laments by George Hagen Random House  2004  "I'm still a Lament, Mum. Laments travel."   With that, 18-year old Will Lament brings to a close the tragic-comic saga of the Lament family and their quest to belong, a quest that takes them from Rhodesia to the Middle East, back to Africa, off to England and eventually on to New Jersey.   Howard, a keen engineering intellect, and Julia, a passionate and artistic woman, are an unusual couple. Progressive on politics and race in Southern Rhodesia of the 1950s, the Laments live in a state of perpetual longing. As the story opens, the Laments are in a small Rhodesian hospital celebrating the birth of their first child, an event transformed by a tragic confluence of good intention and mental instability.  Over the next eighteen years, through the childhood and maturation of young Will Lament, the family leads a peripatetic and transient life. Eager to provide for his young family and fearful of his hermit father's reclusive end, Howard is always reminding Julia that "Laments travel". Hagen, who by the age of 12 had lived on three continents, paints a vivid picture of life in each of the stops along the Lament way. "The Laments" is a story of belonging, the importance of finding our role and place in the world. For Howard Lament, each move is an opportunity to better provide for his family and to fulfill his role as father and husband. For Julia Lament, however, each move serves to wrench her from friends and relationships, the familiar surroundings in which she has begun to construct a life. Young Will appears largely an afterthought in these moves whose friendships and securities are dismissed with the all too common assumption that children can simply easily pick up in a new place.   The portraits of life as the Laments move from Southern Rhodesia, to the Middle East, back to Africa, on to England and then eventually the United States are detailed by Hagen with attention to the social and work pressures and a respect for different cultures. At the same time, there is a sense that Howard Lament's search will never end and it left this reader with the question: why? For a strong woman like Julia Lament, her (mostly) passive willingness to uproot her life and world every time the wanderlust strikes her husband is perplexing and inadequately addressed. While Hagen makes it clear that Julia deeply loves Howard that seems an incomplete explanation for the never-ending move.   Hagen's greatest strength ends up bringing to light what I consider to be his greatest weakness. "The Laments" is a tapestry of very 3-dimensional and fascinating characters. The eccentric Dr. Underberg, the patient Julia Lament, stoic Will Lament, Julia's elitist, racist, but ultimately, deeply loving and devoted mother Rose, and  the vibrant, mischievous and deviant twins Marcus & Julius. Hagen has created so many rich and deep characters he scarcely seems to know how to tell his story with this many strands. The result is a reliance on the easy out: a leap from a bridge, an ill-fated hike, a blinding blizzard and alcohol. Not knowing how to juggle the many balls of great characters, Hagen simply kills them. In one case, towards the end of this book, this is almost palpably tragic and, as in nearly all cases, unnecessary. "The Laments" would be, unquestionably, a harder story to tell and a messier one, but also a better and more satisfying one.   With "The Laments", George Hagen has told a great, though deeply flawed, story about a fascinating family. As he begins work on his second novel, let's hope Hagen is not daunted by the complexity of a coat of many colors and resists the urge to pull its strands.   Recommended.

      Booknotes: Stories from American History edited by Bryan Lamb Perseus Books  2001  One of the more creative results of corporate brainstorming is C-Span, the public affairs programming that now occupies three different channels on cable television. While the congressional hearings and gavel-to-gavel coverage of the United States Senate and House of Representatives are familiar to many, C-Span, under the leadership of the visionary Bryan Lamb, has branched out to provide educational programming, including an on-the-road educational touring bus program. In 1989, C-Span, with Lamb hosting, began to offer a series of interviews on non-fiction books. As Lamb tells it, the Booknotes series began as the result of a conversation with the late Warren Burger, the mediocre, pedantic, and unoriginal Chief Justice who found his calling as an administrator and later as the leader of the efforts to celebrate the bicentennial of the United States constitution.  Booknotes invites authors of non-fiction works to the spartan studio for one interview even if, as Lamb writes, "we didn't have the foresight to book them for their masterwork." The program is an often thought-provoking hour of insight into the creative process of writing and, of course, the substance of the book.   In "Booknotes: Stories from American History", Lamb adapts these hour-long interviews into excerpted essays. Beginning with the revolutionary activities of the 1770s through the Reagan years in the 1980s, this book provides a broad tapestry of essays on books that cover the gamut of American history and American cultural, political, and social development. The survey, however, loses something in the excerpting. These interviews range rather freely and don't lend themselves well to editing. To cite one example, Lamb summarizes his interview with Elizabeth Taylor, author of the book "American Pharaoh: Mayor Richard J. Daley, his battle for Chicago and the Nation" with the following quotes:   Referring to the disaster of the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, he quotes Taylor as saying, "...in the end Daley was really underestimated, and he came out of it all brilliantly." I've read "American Pharaoh" and Elizabeth Taylor did NOT treat the 1968 Democratic convention as a highpoint for the dictatorial, racist mayor. It was a low point that marked his effective end as a national political powerbroker. He hardly "came out of it brilliantly". He was scorned and a United States senator attacked his police and city at the podium.   The excerpted interview seems less a reflection of the book written by Taylor than perhaps an effort to laud a political hero of Bryan Lamb's, if Daley is such. The excerpt barely touches on the corruption, the racism, and political blackmail that characterized Mayor Daley's 21 years in office, elements that are critical to the actual book Taylor produced.   This example demonstrates the weakness of the book. These essays are summarized and, in some cases, severely edited versions of free-ranging discussions on major works, most of which took years to research, write, and publish. As a survey of subjects in American history and a possible bibliography of works for someone interested in reading the works cited, it has a certain utility. As a summary, however, of the works, it is of fairly limited value and, as the Taylor interview shows, open to a rather profoundly inaccurate summarization.

      The end of books?  July 22, 2004  BY KEVIN NANCE AND MIKE THOMAS Staff Reporters   You won't find very many Chicken Littles in the upper echelons of the publishing industry. Not only is the sky not falling, several top executives said at BookExpo America in Chicago in June, it's bright and sunny, and on a clear day you can see forever. "I'm completely optimistic about the future of book publishing," said Jane Friedman, president and CEO of HarperCollins Publishers. Jonathan Karp, editor-in-chief at Random House -- publisher of Dan Brown's megaselling The Da Vinci Code -- pronounced himself "very bullish." And George Witte, editor-in-chief at St. Martin's Press, insisted: "I hear people all the time saying, 'Oh, the sky is falling,' but I've never been able to do that gloom-and-doom thing for very long. So I'm optimistic; I hope I'm not being a Pollyanna." But underneath this chorus of optimism at BookExpo, you could detect an ominous bass line of warning. Among the chief Cassandras was Albert Greco, a principal author of a new report by the Book Industry Study Group, a trade association, showing that while the industry made slightly more money in 2003 than 2002, it sold fewer books -- 23 million fewer, to be exact. "Revenues are up, but that's mostly because publishers raised the price of books," said Greco, a Fordham University Business School professor who has studied the publishing industry for years. "The bottom line is, people are reading and buying fewer books. This is an industry that's being kept afloat by price increases." Other reports issued at BookExpo -- including one by the Association of American Publishers, a trade association chaired by HarperCollins' Friedman -- painted a much rosier picture; the AAP report showed a 6 percent increase in consumer book revenues. "But when people were bullish this year, they're really comparing that to last year, when you had the Iraq war and an uncertain economy," said Jim Milliott, senior editor for business and news at Publishers Weekly. "Nobody would dispute that unit sales are stagnant at best."  Greco pointed out that while the AAP survey excluded several major book categories and relied on reporting data from only 24 large publishers, the Book Industry Study Group report includes all book categories and factored in numbers from about 2,800 publishers. In the end, he noted, his tabulations were within less than 1 percent of those reached independently by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which also tracks book sales. "I'm very confident of the strength of these numbers, and they're not good news," he said. "The sky may not be falling, but there are some dark clouds gathering, no doubt about it." Barrie Rappaport, the Chicago-based chief analyst for Ipsos BookTrends (which monitors the book-buying habits of 16,000 representative U.S. households), agreed that the book industry, while hardly in danger of immediate collapse, is in for tough times. She noted that the percentage of households buying at least one trade book during 2003 slipped from the previous year, down one point from 56 percent to 55 percent. Those same households, she said, also cut back on their trade-book purchases by about 6 percent compared with 2002.  "The problem is that you can only grow by attracting new customers, but the industry is not attracting new customers; in fact, it's losing customers," Rappaport said. "That means it's relying more and more on the heavier book-buyer -- the more affluent, higher-educated customer -- but we're seeing some slack in that area as well. There's only so many books that those people can buy." The root of all evil Why the slippage? One major factor, several experts agreed, is the recent growth of the used-book market, which has been cutting into sales of new books. If you can get a perfectly good used copy of a book for less than half the price -- which is easier than ever now, thanks to used-book Internet brokers such as Abebooks.com and, increasingly, Amazon -- why buy new? The used-book trend is especially notable among heavy book-buyers, Rappaport said, and in the college textbook market, in which Greco estimates that $1 out of every $3 is now spent on used books, with the trend heading toward $1 out of every $2. But the deeper problem -- the root of all evil, from the publishing industry standpoint -- is the fact that as entertainment choices multiply, Americans are reading less. According to numbers crunched by Veronis Suhler Stevenson, a New York-based investment bank that specializes in media companies, Americans spent 120 hours a person a year reading consumer books in 1998; by 2003, the number of hours had fallen to 106. By 2006, the projected number of hours we spend reading will be 103. By contrast, according to the VSS findings, television-watching took up 1,551 hours of our time in 1998, and is expected to rise to 1,679 hours two years from now. Internet use is also skyrocketing, from 54 hours in 1998 to a projected 213 hours in 2006. And "Reading at Risk," a new survey released this month by the National Endowment for the Arts using data collected by the Census Bureau, shows that the percentage of Americans who read novels, short stories, plays or poetry -- and, in fact, any sort of book -- has steadily declined in the past two decades. The drop-off was especially noticeable among young adults, with literary reading among 18-to-24-year-olds dropping from almost 60 percent in 1982 to about 43 percent in 2002.  "In 1980, life was very different," Greco said. "You didn't have cable, you didn't have satellite. You didn't have VCRs and DVDs. You didn't have the Internet. These new technologies, while they're wonderful, have diverted people away from a lot of things, including reading." As Robert Miller, president of Hyperion Books, put it: "Mindshare is a big issue." How big? It depends on whom you ask. "Television, the radio, the Internet, video games -- all the things that are supposedly taking up consumer time -- I only see them as giving us an advantage and helping us to market our book product," HarperCollins' Friedman says. "There's a lot of this gloom and doom, and I don't believe it at all." Added Witte, of St. Martin's: "There are still a lot of people out there who love to read, in spite of all the other entertainment options they have." But Catherine Kitcho, a California-based author and independent publisher, is less upbeat. "It's basically a question of attention span," she said. "There are just so many ways people can spend their time -- everything from watching 300 channels on cable to listening to their iPods -- that take time away from reading. That's the basic problem, and it's sad." Then there are the demographic trends, which, especially in the long-term, are worrying. "The population that buys most hardcover books is an older one," Miller said. "And as the baby boom ages, we may or may not have a younger audience there to fill in at the same level." Which leads to the question: In the video-game age, are we failing to raise a new generation of readers?  "I think that's a huge challenge for publishers," said Andrew Grabois, senior director of publisher relations at R.R. Bowker, the firm that issues ISBN numbers for books in the United States. “The primary target customer for books is folks over 35, 40 years old. Children are exposed to books for the first few years of life, when they're read to, and then for the next 30 years or so, they're mainly exposed to music and movies and all that other stuff. The hope is that they'll come home to books when they're in their 40s, but can publishers really afford to wait that long? That's probably not the best game plan." But with the Harry Potter craze still in full swing, aren't more children reading, and isn't it reasonable to expect they'll continue the habit as adults? According to Ipsos, children's books had a fairly good year in 2003, with early lackluster sales jolted by the June release of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. But despite the Potter phenomenon, Rappaport said, the consumer base for children's books is actually shrinking, with 33 percent of American households buying at least one book for someone under the age of 14 in 2003, compared with 35 percent in 2002. "Even with exciting, new and value-added books on the market," Rappaport reported recently on the Ipsos Web site, "the children's book industry has not managed to substantially increase the volume of children's book purchases or share-of-wallet." It's not all bad, though Not all the news is bad. According to the AAP study, children's and young-adult hardcover sales grew by 19 percent in 2003 over the previous year, while religious publishing grew by a startling 37 percent. Audio books (13 percent increase) and e-books (45 percent) also had good years, although they continue to represent only tiny slivers of the market. "E-books might actually take hold," said Publishers Weekly's Milliott. "But there's no reason to think that publishing will do anything other than march along at 2 to 3 percent sales growth, with unit sales flat to declining." In the short term, Greco expects 2004 to be "a banner year" for juvenile books, with an increase of perhaps 200 million units, mainly because of several blockbuster movies ("Shrek 2," "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" and Pixar's upcoming "The Incredibles") with book tie-ins. Overall, he said, trade book sales will likely be up 100 million in 2004.  Overall, though, Greco sees the publishing industry at a precarious and crucial stage. "The book business has had to go through the same experience that other industries have gone through with respect to television," he said. "When TV was introduced in the 1950s, the motion-picture industry and radio had to change. Now, with increased competition from cable and the Internet, they have to change again, and the book industry does, too. The good news is, they're all still there; there's no media format that completely died out as a result of TV. So publishing will probably survive. But we have to be realistic about what the numbers tell us."

      What He Learned at the Amazon Evolution  Reading Amazonia: Five Years At the Epicenter of the Dot.com Juggernaut (The New Press), by former Amazon.com editor James Marcus, feels like reuniting with friends from high school to reminisce about old times.  Remember that crazy Christmas when even the executives had to pack books in the warehouse? Remember when a human being designed the home page each day? Remember how shocking--shocking I tell you--it was to find out Amazon was accepting money from publishers for prominent placement on the site? It all seems like such a long time ago.  Of course, it wasn't really so far in the past. Marcus worked at Amazon from 1996 to 2001. That's barely long enough for clothes to go out of style. But in Amazon years it was a very different era. Marcus, Amazon employee number 55, chronicles the evolution of the company from start-up virtual bookstore to a multi-billion dollar purveyor of DVD players and garden hoses.  Marcus, who has since left Amazon and returned east to a writing life in New York City, talked with PW Daily's Karen Holt about what he learned at the evolution.  PW Daily: You grew frustrated with being forced into a role at Amazon that was increasingly more marketing oriented than pure editorial. Looking back, you seem to think the shift was inevitable. But many people look to booksellers, especially independents, for recommendations. Is being a trusted, candid source of literary guidance incompatible with selling books?  James Marcus: I think they become less and less compatible once you start dealing with a very big business where, inevitably, other considerations come into play. I see nothing contradictory with independent booksellers making recommendations of books they love. I don't necessarily think the act of selling something precludes giving good advice about it.  PW: Amazon used a tool that measured reviews, interviews and features on the site in terms of "adds" (someone made a purchase after reading it) and "repels" (someone read it without buying anything). How did it feel to be told your work was repelling readers?  JM: That was a tremendously dispiriting thought. As I say in the book, writing for a place like Amazon really did give you an unrivaled opportunity to see how many people were reading your work and how many people were in a sense "repelled" by it. I think it's a kindness to writers to not have that staring them in the face.  PW: It sounds like making up business jargon was a popular sport at Amazon, with phrases like "pulling on revenue levers," (translation: making more money) and "inflection point" (the point at which you make more money) saturating the air at staff meetings. What was your favorite bit of biz-speak?  JM: I think "monetizing eyeballs" (making more money) is still one of my favorites, simply because it suggests something a little surreal and grotesque and it seems to encapsulate some of the cruder and less realistic ideas that were coming out of the marketing department. Built into that phrase was an assumption that customers were very passive animals and you could essentially march them into the milking stall and they would begin buying stuff.  PW: At one point your colleagues at Amazon kicked around the idea of running book recommendations from celebrities including the cast of Friends. One co-worker felt the need to explain to you: "Cynthia Ozick is not a celebrity." But honestly, who's more likely to move books--Cynthia Ozick or Jennifer Anniston?  JM: The sad fact is that many more people would rather take recommendations from Jennifer Anniston. I fall into the Cynthia Ozick camp.  PW: What's your take on Jeff Bezos?  JM: I think he's enormously smart, very good humored, and amiable to the point of goofiness. All of which disguises a level of ambition compared to which Napoleon is an underachiever. There's no doubt in my mind that from the beginning he wanted to be the lord of e-commerce."  PW: How often do you check your book's Amazon.com sales rating?  JM: I worked there, so I really should know better, because if you're not in the top 100, it takes very little to have these wild gyrations. And on top of that, Amazon represents only 5% to 10% of the bookselling market. That said, I find myself checking it much more often than I should; it's highly addictive. I have made various vows to not look. I'll say to myself "I won't look until Friday." It's Thursday sometimes when I say that. It's too bad there's not a Betty Ford Clinic for writers to shake off their ranking addition. (As of this afternoon, the book was at 4,631).  PW: When Amazon's stock was flying high, you were worth $9 million, at least on paper. So how much did you walk away with? Are you rich?  JM: Certainly not as rich as I thought I would be. It depends on your definition of rich. When I returned to New York in 2001, I was, sad to say, no longer a millionaire. I went into Amazon penniless and when I came out I was much better off. For that, I am grateful. But let's just say I won't be retiring anytime soon.

      My Life by President Bill Clinton Alfred A. Knopf 2004  Some observations from the outset:  1. Presidential memoir is among the least respected forms of literature. With the notable exception of President Ulysses Grant's memoirs, focusing in large part on the Civil War, the format is generally viewed as historical whitewash.   2. For those who decided in the early months of 1992 that Bill Clinton was the Devil and spent the next eight years (or, sadly, now 12...and counting) looking for proof and screaming about it, keep on moving. This isn't the book where he admits: he killed Vince Foster, murdered state troopers, molested women, sexually harassed state employees, stole from banks, traded on insider information in the bond market, dealt drugs, snorted coke, shot heroin, let Osama get away on purpose, hates America, consorted with Communists in Russia, burned his draft card, lied, cheated, or any of the other things you  KNEW  he had already done or would surely do by January 1992, though you'd never heard of Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, Whitewater, Ken Starr, David Sentelle or anything else.   3. There are over 400 customer reviews on Amazon for this title. Predictably enough, they largely fall into two categories: the haters and the likers. There are some that are reviews of the book, not the man. That's what this will be.   4. ONE NOTE ON COMMENTING ON THIS:  PLEASE*PLEASE*PLEASE , WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,  DO NOT  SHARE COMMENTS ON THE MAN--ONLY ON THE BOOK.  _________________________________________________________________________________________  "My Life" should not be one book, perhaps true of all presidential biography. Particularly for those who serve 2 terms as President, one volume is insufficient. This book largely falls into 2 pieces: the President's youth through his tenure as Governor of Arkansas and then his years as President.  The youth and years in Arkansas are the better part of this book. From a troubled childhood with an alcoholic and abusive stepfather, the President is able to make some insightful observations on his development and his coping skills. Echoes of those experiences certainly colored his later life, in both good and bad ways. His background, though humble, is certainly not the log cabin-esque variety sometimes portrayed. Supported by a large and loving family and blessed with a keen intellect and curiosity, the President was, rare in the 1950s south, lucky to grow up in a town of relative racial harmony with a family averse to the racism gripping the region.   His education, particularly at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. and his internship experience on the staff of United States Senator J. William Fulbright, the powerful chairman of the Foreign Relations committee, in the mid 1960s provides a fuller backdrop to his developing opposition to the Vietnam war and struggles over how to respond to the obligations of military service. This is among the more reflective and illuminating sections of the book.   The political life, starting with an unsuccessful but impressive bid for the United States House of Representatives in 1974 (he lost, garnering 48%), in Arkansas is painted well, with a focus on his administration's efforts on education and economic development.  The most reflective and illuminating passages deal with his 1980 defeat by Frank White, a race he would re-run with a different result in 1982. The lessons of this defeat are ably illustrated in the remaining chapters on the gubernatorial years and his adoption of an incremental and cumulative agenda in focused areas. It was an approach he would employ as President with varying degrees of success.   When the book turns to the presidency, it becomes, as has been pointed out by nearly all commentators, a recitation of his planner. While I think those who found it "numbing" are exaggerating substantially, it is not nearly as focused, reflective, or interesting as it could have been. After the conclusion of World War II, Winston Churchill authored a much-respected history of the war, in multiple volumes. It’s clear that the President's memoir should be handled in a similar fashion. The foreign policy history is amongst the most interesting. The President has provided insights and glimpses into the minds and machinations of negotiations occurring in Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Northern Ireland, and, most often, the Middle East. With respect to the Balkans, the Middle East, and Northern Ireland, an individual volume could have been written.   The President's domestic agenda is presented largely as a recitation, and, in particular after the 1994 mid-term elections, in the same successive and cumulative fashion as handled in Arkansas. While there are several "Clinton laws of politics", it would have been interesting to have more on this subject and more reflection on what worked, what didn't, and the underlying reasons.   What is largely missing in the presidential years is reflection and commentary on how one goes about being President, what shapes the life of the President as he approaches his responsibilities (apart from, for example, foreign policy or presenting a budget), and how the fires of the experience have changed the President.   This is, at least, 2 books: Arkansas and the Presidency. For those seeking insights into the complex and keen mind of President Clinton, this will provide some tidbits. The book is more useful as a recitation and history of the years of the Clinton presidency, the legacy of which history will surely write.

      Book Business: Publishing Past Present and Future by Jason Epstein W.W. Norton 2001  Jason Epstein, the founder of the  New York Review of Books , spent fifty years in book publishing in New York. During the 1950s, he worked at Random House, in the Villard mansion, with the likes of James Baldwin and W.H. Auden lounging on couches and chatting up editors. Bennett Cerf still co-owned the firm. It was the twilight of a heyday in publishing that would soon be radically transformed by the changing nature of American demographics, the emergence of the suburbs, and the attendant changes in American shopping habits.   Intended to be the first of a series of books published in cooperation with the New York Public Library Center for Scholars and Writers, "Book Business: Publishing Past Present and Future" follows a lecture given by Epstein on the nature of modern book publishing and trends for the future.   In his recitation of history and his understanding of the broad scope of publishing, Epstein is at his most impressive. An obviously erudite and cultured man, Epstein thrived in an industry known for small margins and high risks. He writes of his creation of Anchor Books, a series of classics in paperback format, but makes a pointed observation: his aim had been to "restore and extend the  ancien regime  of literature, not create a new world". It was then, he observes, that he was aware of his "ambivalence toward innovation". Publishing would prove to be a challenging field for someone with such ambivalence.   Over the next several decades, Americans began to move to the suburbs in increasing numbers and shopping patterns emerged in the form of malls. As chain bookstores began to proliferate in these high rent outlets, the need for merchandise turnover increased, putting greater pressure on publishers to produce best-sellers and return, time and again, to a stable of reliable big ticket writers. Though Epstein does not spend nearly as much time on the subject, the publishing industry would also become increasingly consolidated and dominated by big players, among the largest, of course, his employer, Random House.   By definition, more speculative and open to doubt are Epstein's observations on the future of the publishing industry. Epstein observes that, despite the increasing domination of major chains and the related, though one can argue persuasively, not causally-linked, decline in independent bookstores, the publishing field will be democratized by the internet. Authors, he writes, will increasingly opt, as Stephen King has done, to offer their products directly to consumers. He predicts the emergence of kiosks where books can be printed and cheaply bound after a direct delivery. Correlative to this, of course, will be an increase in on-demand publishing firms, such as Ingram's Lightning Press.   Perhaps. The democratization and broader dissemination of books across a multitude of media would be an unquestionably good thing. That American shopping or reading habits will be substantially impacted, however, is considerably more speculative. Apart from audio books, formats other than traditional books have fared poorly. Portable book readers with computerized books, books on disc and downloadable books have generally suffered poor reviews. The tactile experience of a book may be difficult to articulate, but appears critical. Online shopping experiences, such as Amazon.com, have brought more choice, but continue to suffer two major challenges: long-term profitability/viability of the business model and the challenge of creating a browseable experience.   Even a change in delivery model and democratization of the industry wouldn't change the underlying taste of the American reader. In seeming response to the poor quality of the reviews being published by the  New York Times , Epstein co-founded the  New York Review of Books  around 1963. A strike at the Times helped boost the publication initially and it has run profitably for nearly forty years. Epstein, however, was not merely critical of the quality of the reviews, but seemingly the choices of what was being reviewed as well. He observes that, "...most charitably...editors had not adjusted to the sophisticated generation of post-war, college-educated of readers." Democratizing the industry, however, seems unlikely to reduce the clamor for Stephen King, John Grisham, or Danielle Steele.   This is a fascinating and rich history of the publishing industry. For those interested in publishing, books, and bookstores, I highly recommend this book and hope for future installments in the promised series.

      Fruit by Brian Francis MacAdam/Cage 2004   The first novel of Toronto freelance writer Brian Francis is the story of 13-year old Peter Paddington, an overweight and rather insecure young man, struggling to cope with an eccentric family, school, and a budding sexuality. Oh, and his nipples talk to him too.   While "Fruit" has a touch of the bizarre and disturbing, this is a story of a year in the life of a teenager. From Peter's over-protective mother with a penchant for medicating with food, his profane & tomboyish neighbor Daniela Bertoli, and Billy Archer, for whom he develops something of an infatuation, Francis has created unique and three-dimensional characters who have a depth apart from the observations of our 13-year old narrator.   Most impressive, however, is Francis' ability to get inside the head of his protagonist and bring to life the insecurities, fears, quiet thoughts, daydreams, obsessions, infatuations, and musings of a teenager. Francis so fully articulates and captures the essence of Peter Paddington one is prompted to ask: is this autobiographical?   As Peter traipses his paper route delivering the  Sarnia Observer , he wonders, almost aloud, about the lives going on behind the curtains, making observations and jumping to conclusions. At school, he observes the social dynamic of school cliques such as the slut girls, athletes (jocks), shorts (nerds), and bangers (burn-outs) that almost anyone would recognize. And, he experiences the pain of finding himself on the outside of them all. At home, Peter lives with his parents and two older teenager sisters with occasional visits from Uncle Ed ("What's in the news?). The family dynamic is simultaneously eccentric and normal as Peter's mother experiences "The Change", Peter's sisters nag, argue, diet, and date, and Peter's father quietly and somewhat resignedly takes things in stride.  Through his "conversations" with his nipples, his "bedtime movies", and his prayers to the Virgin Mary, we begin to understand the underlying tension and struggle Peter faces. He's different...and he's beginning to realize it.   In 2000, Francis won the Emerging Author award from the Writer's Union of Canada, an organization founded in 1973 to promote writing and better conditions for writers in Canada. The WUC sponsors several other major Canadian writing prizes, including short story and poetry prizes. "Fruit" is proof that the WUC's confidence was well placed.   Recommended.

      No Ordinary Time by Doris Kearns Goodwin Simon & Schuster 1994  In 2002, after a career in which she'd worked for President Lyndon Johnson, authored numerous books in American history, and taught as a professor at Harvard University, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin found herself at the center of a swirling controversy about plagiarism. The  Weekly Standard  reported that in her book, "The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys", Goodwin had engaged in plagiarism so extensive, particularly of author Lynne McTaggart's work "Kathleen Kennedy", that she was forced into a substantial settlement with McTaggart who had threatened to sue for copyright infringement. Later allegations were made regarding other Goodwin works, including "No Ordinary Time", the story of Franklin & Eleanor Roosevelt on the home front during the World War Two years. Plagiarism is a grave offense in academia and history. I've read the passages in David McCullough's "Truman" allegedly plagiarized by Goodwin and the case there seems flimsy at best. With respect to works by others, including FDR's personal secretary Grace Tully, the case for plagiarism in "No Ordinary Time" is far more compelling and troubling.   This matters not only because of the serious nature of the offense, but because this book went on to win Goodwin the Pulitzer Prize. It is a sad endnote that any commentary on Goodwin must include this discussion, but to exclude it would be inappropriate.   "No Ordinary Time" is an exceptional piece of scholarship and, for those interested in the World War Two era and presidential history, it is an essential work. The two stars of this book are, unquestionably, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, supported by a long cast of characters who are generously fleshed out by Goodwin, including Harry Hopkins, Lorena Hicock, Missy LeHand, Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd, Anna Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Joe Lash, Malvina Thompson, and the President's indomitable mother Sara Delano Roosevelt.   The book opens with the tension settling over the White House as Hitler's armies pour into Holland, Luxembourg, Belgium, & France. Referring to this as the end of the phony war, Roosevelt realizes, perhaps sooner than any other American that the United States will surely be pulled into the conflagration engulfing Europe and he must figure out how to bring a reluctant and isolationist people along. As the President's focus shifts overseas, the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, continues to travel the United States, closely examining the work of New Deal programs, meeting with citizens, encouraging young women, and paying growing attention to the challenges facing black America. Her detailed reports to the President are the stuff of legend, his grillings detailed down to the number of trees planted along a row. It is a partnership that has been written of so often it almost seems clichéd to describe it as it was: Eleanor Roosevelt proved the eyes and ears out in America for her handicapped husband who could not as easily move about the country.   Since her discovery of Franklin's infidelity with a staffer, Lucy Mercer, in 1918, Eleanor Roosevelt had lived a life independent of her husband in many respects. During his battle with polio, she emerged as the beacon keeping the Roosevelt name before the voting public, an effort that was rewarded in 1928 with the Governorship of New York. During that time, Eleanor learned of her own considerable leadership and administrative skill, and her inexhaustible appetite for work. It's worth noting that both President and Mrs. Roosevelt outlived their secretaries, Missy LeHand and Malvina "Tommie" Thompson, perhaps in part done in by the exhausting nature of working for two forces of nature. As a result of finding her voice through this tremendous pain, Eleanor Roosevelt was able to re-craft the role of First Lady in fundamental ways. She held press conferences with female reporters; she produced a daily newspaper column, and traveled extensively across the United States and the world. In President Roosevelt, she had an admiring and supportive husband, as long as she didn't press issues too hard with him at the wrong time, something she had a tendency to do.   As the nation moves inexorably, if haltingly, to war, Mrs. Roosevelt finds herself fighting a rear guard action to maintain the social and economic gains made during the New Deal, particularly with respect to minorities and labor. If the nation is to mobilize and meet the staggering production goals necessary to arm the British and Russians, giving Roosevelt precious time to move American public opinion, a change in relations with US business, long hostile to the New Deal is necessary. American military leaders clash repeatedly with Mrs. Roosevelt who argues passionately that sacrificing the rights of working men and women in the United States in order to prepare us for war will leave the nation in a desperate strait defensively.   A book has perhaps never been more aptly named than "No Ordinary Time", taken from a speech given by Eleanor Roosevelt. This book paints the picture of two deeply complex and driven Americans, striving to deliver the very best for their nation at home and for the world overseas during a time of almost unimaginable challenge. The rich supporting cast is described in wonderful detail. I particularly enjoy the image of a scantily clad Churchill advising his White House valet that he will require 90-year old Brandy at bed time every night. The Churchill visits were known to throw the White House into a tumult and Eleanor, in particular, would dread them. During this time, the White House became something of a long-term transient hotel, housing Churchill for weeks at a time, Lorena Hicock for 4 years, and presidential confidante Harry Hopkins for nearly as long. The image is of a house constantly in motion with men and women coming and going, and the unfailingly social president surrounded.   Perhaps better than almost any presidential biography I've ever read, this book provides a remarkable insight into life in the White House from 1940 through President Roosevelt's April 1945 death. Along with the eclectic White House cast of characters, Goodwin has brought to life the President's frequent journeys to his ancestral home at Hyde Park (where he and Mrs. Roosevelt would both later be buried), his friendships with, among others, Hopkins, LeHand, and Princess Marguerite, the epic decisions regarding military strategy, the political calculations and conventions leading to 3rd and 4th terms, and battles with an increasingly resistant and conservative congress.   The best history leaves you imagining you had a ringside seat as events unfolded and "No Ordinary Time" delivers on that richly.   Highly Recommended.

      Lake Effect by Rich Cohen  Borzoi Books (Knopf, Random House)  2002  Probably about 20 miles from my front door, on the northern lake shore of Chicago, lies the community of Glencoe, an upscale northern suburb, served as they all are by the Metra's Union Pacific North Line. Every morning, the trains deliver the well heeled from Glencoe, Lake Forest, Highland Park, Winnetka, and Kenilworth to their roosts at Mayer Brown, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and a litany of other citadels of prosperity in Chicago's loop. While things have changed some in the past twenty years, many of the women of this real life regional Stepford spend their days at the country clubs, teas, and doing invaluable volunteer work with the many organizations created to ward off what would otherwise be mind-numbing boredom. Domestic servants, usually housekeepers or maids, are not uncommon.  I point this out for two reasons. First, because in "Lake Effect", author Rich Cohen ("Tough Jews", "The Avengers: A Jewish War Story") has told the story of growing up in Glencoe, a memoir of his teen years and itinerant life as a visitor from college. And secondly because approximately 15 miles north of Glencoe lies the even more upscale community of Lake Forest, where I attended college, overlapping with Cohen's New Trier High School experience by two years. As a reader, I find it nearly impossible to separate my experience of those years and my knowledge of the names he drops with the reading of his book. Those years become the lens through which I read "Lake Effect".  I suppose the first question one might ask is: even if one can, ought one write a memoir of high school? Have any of us experienced enough at that point in our lives to write something that ought be written? In particular, can one write a compelling memoir of high school, having grown up isolated from many of the struggles one might face in a community of less affluence? Rich Cohen’s parents weren’t abusive, they weren’t alcoholics, they weren’t divorced, and the family wasn’t living in a 2-room apartment in Rogers Park, struggling to figure out whether it would be food or prescription drugs this week.   The answer is, I think, a combination of maybe and sort of.   A slow starting book, “Lake Effect” does pick up steam as Cohen moves through the years. The focal point, if not fixation, in the book is what one would aptly call Cohen’s idol worship of friend, Jamie “Drew-licious” Drew. I think Cohen would chafe at that and if so, he ought re-read his own work. Drew does appear a more complex figure, a presumed family tragedy having sundered his family. At the same time, his keek attitude, his cool reserve, his Kerouackian trek after high school, and his Mardi gras bender...all have a certain forced and artificial aura. It all reeks of someone trying way too hard to be different. That kids from Glencoe would pile into their classic convertible Mustang and drive to Chicago’s South Side to listen to blues at the Checkerboard Lounge isn’t hip or different, it’s entirely predictable.   This points up a weakness in Cohen’s book. Either “Drew-licious” was, in fact, trying too hard or Cohen has so overwritten the point, he’s made it seem so.   Other characters come and go throughout the book, notably Cohen’s parents and his gang of New Trier friends. Perhaps the most sage point in the book is made by Cohen’s father, Herbie, who counsels Jamie about his seeming lack of college plans (he does in fact go to Kansas) saying: “Mistakes you make now. These are real mistakes.”   Cohen’s strength lies in his observations about the summer months and how friendship evolves over time. Perhaps this is where his points are most universal and least influenced by the backdrop of affluence and privilege attendant to a Glencoe upbringing. Painted vibrantly, the summer months glow in the book—showcasing the special places for a teen growing up with joints like Sloppy Ed’s, playing softball in a summer league, and spending nights walking along the Lake Michigan beach front.   At Tulane, Cohen seems mostly to discover drugs and drinking and more drugs. In search of a Jamie, he finds a house filled with guys with keek, that special unique attitude, almost impossible to put into words. Its beyond coolness...and evidently requires consuming a mind-numbing amount of drugs and dropping out of school. Hey, sounds good! Jamie shows up, of course, and is proudly shown off by Cohen...in a “see-how-cool-my-high-school-friend-is” moment. Before vanishing on a three day Mardi Gras bender and then leaving, Jamie manages to get Cohen to take Ecstasy, an experience for which he professes great gratitude. Images of Aronofsky’s “Requiem for a Dream” played in my head as I read about the Tulane years. A kid from the North Shore discovers drinking and drugs and loves both! Now that’s news!   As the book winds down, Cohen offers some interesting observations on his work as a messenger at The New Yorker magazine and his evolution as a writer. He writes very poignantly of Jamie’s troubles upon returning to Glencoe after graduation from Kansas. Interestingly, it’s the first time in the book where Cohen treats Jamie as a human being and an equal...and it’s the most compelling part of the entire book. Adjusting to life after college is, for many, an enormously difficult challenge. Returning home to a community where time has passed you by and your presence is a reminder of how far you’ve not come is painful. Jamie experiences both and Cohen is at his best in speaking of it.  “Lake Effect” was an oddly personal read for me. Perhaps the experience coming of age on the North Shore myself in college makes much of this too familiar. Drug-loving children of privilege were not in short supply at Lake Forest College in the mid 1980s and, unlike Cohen, I didn’t find it funny, brilliant, or adventurous. Just self-indulgent, obnoxious, and particularly offensive since it was usually paid for with the hard-earned money sent by parents and grandparents. For all that, however, there are some great images of summer, some familiar stories of friendship, and some great observations about time and change in “Lake Effect”. Uncharacteristically, I can’t recommend this book broadly. I do think for male readers, particularly in Chicago, it would be an interesting read about male friendship and growing up.

      Adam of the Road by Elizabeth Janet Gray Puffin Newberry Library 1942  Winner of the 1943 Newberry Medal, this book tells the story of eleven-year old Adam Quartermayne, son of the Roger the Minstrel. Set in 13th century England, "Adam of the Road" provides a fascinating glimpse into itinerant and medieval life.   The story opens with Adam enrolled at the school of Saint Albans Abbey, a situation he finds both irksome and temporary. Despite the reassuring presence of his loyal dog Nick, safely ensconced with a school neighbor for a penny per month, and his serious and studious friend Perkin, Adam longs to be on the road, living the minstrel life with his father.  Finally reappearing from his journeys in France to learn more minstrelsy, Roger, now in the service of a Lord, sweeps Adam up on to his gift of a warhorse and they're off. Author Gray shows a real skill for portraying the daily activities of the medieval life, the long meal preparations, the elaborate rituals of tending to a knight, the vibrant markets. At the same time, and in particular in passages tending to Adam's life in the home of the noble de Lisle family, Gray captures the interplay between young friends meeting for the first time, the petty jealousies and insecurities, and the budding friendships. Much as boys today might bond over an X-Box or a Sega system, Adam builds bonds with the other boys in service on the de Lisle estate during play jousting.  When Roger takes once again to the road, after all minstrels aren't generally kept full-time in service, Adam begins to learn some difficult lessons. Some gambling gone wrong with the wrong person eventually results in Adam's beloved Nick vanishing without a trace. In his haste to find the dog he loves, Adam and Roger are separated and a young boy of 11 is now roaming the English countryside, desperately looking for both, alone.   In part, the accomplishment of this book is showing that, while hardly common, it was not unusual to see an eleven-year-old boy on the English country roads. Adam encounters his share of challenges, setbacks, and kindnesses along this journey. As with the earlier sections of the book, Gray vividly portrays the homes, inns, fairs, meals, pubs, and churches of the time. Some readers will, no doubt, be surprised to read that Adam gets ale with his meals. Capturing the image of another time, its essence, its smells, its hue, is the art of seeing the sublime in the ordinary. Gray has an eye for the sublime and sees it in the ferrymen, in the Winchester Fair, in the songs of the minstrels, and in the regimented life of medieval monks.  "Adam of the Road" is not easy reading. Gray has produced a dense 317-page book with an impressive vocabulary and rich detail. As one reviewer commented aptly, young people who can easily digest massive Harry Potter tomes may have considerable difficulty with "Adam of the Road". For young people less than 10 years old, this is probably a "read it to me" book. The payoff for both parent and child is well worth it.   Recommended.
