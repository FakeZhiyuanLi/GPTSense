      and so begins another chapter in the story that is HANNAH. hannah?, i here you asking. who the heck is that, and why should i care? that, my friend, is a question that has plagued even the most advanced of minds for years and years to come.   ...ok perhaps i've exaggerated a bit, but what can you expect? i'm goofy. =P  you are invited, so come and experience my freshman year with me. kick back and relax; stay as long as you like. comment, if it pleases you. whatever floats your boat, toots.    however. consider yourself warned, those of you who know me. i'm not the person i used to be. i've been dragged kicking and screaming through the proverbial mud more times than i'd care to mention, and i suppose one could say that life has taken its cruel, cruel toll on me.  ...did i mention i tend to get carried away in the department of melodrama? one of my many, many charming qualities, as you'll soon find out.  So.  like what you see? care to take a peek further in my life; wallow in my misery, dance in my glory, experience my joy? then by all means, tune in every day or so. i'll try to post frequently. speaking of which, my next post will most likely be next week. seeing as this is a blog about my freshman year, there's hardly any sense in writing when i haven't started school yet. but fear not, minions. high school will come soon enough; it's waiting, oh so silently, to pounce upon me and rip my throat out with claws sharp as protractor blades, scattering my entrails mercilessly through the halls and around the cafeteria. symbolically speaking, of course.  ...  or perhaps it is quite docile. i wouldn't know. :-)

      yah well, i know i said i'd wait till skool started back to continue posting, but hey-i'm a girl; more importantly, a teenage girl, therefore granting me access to change my mind whenever it is convenient and/or necissary. i prefer to call myself 'flexible.' as it is, you should consider this perfectly acceptable and go along with it, or we may never get anywhere tonight as far as posting goes. so i suppose i'll have to eat my words on this one.  so i'll get on with it...or will i? mwahaha. forgive me, i was watching fairly oddparents today and i couldn't help quoting cosmo. good golly, that little fella is too darned cute.  which reminds me, today my sis took me to Gravity in Clinton. it's a small coffee shop/slash art gallery in ye olde Clinton behind MC. very relaxed, very shabby sheek. my kind of place. i'm totally working there once i get a car. but this is not the point. neither is this, but i thought i'd mention it: as i walked in, gathering in my new surroundings, a group of most-likely-college students at a nearby table off towards the right caught my eye..well, to be more specific, a guy sitting with them caught my eye. ah heck, i'll just be honest. that guy was the cutest thing since sliced bread. i squeaked. like literally, squeaked. this is worth noting, i might add, since i don't normally go weak in the knee department upon spying a cutie, but honest to goodness, at that particular moment Jell-O had nothing on the 'ol patellas. anyway, i forgot what my point was when i originally set out to typing this, seeing how i had to take a three hour break to help mum with grocery shopping, so i'll just be moving along to a new paragraph now.  getting a bit nervous about terry. i'll be glad to get my schedule monday. i do have a bit of a heads up on my upcoming high school experience, however. what with my mom being a teacher and all, i have connections. i know that choir is going to be my homeroom, so that's gonna rock. gotta get the pipes ready. singing never really was my bag, but it's worth it to get in a class where most of my friends are. my other elective, art, is seventh period. this seems to have messed with some of my classes. most everyone else will have their electives at another time, but seeing how art isn't normally an option for freshman, yours truly will be on the sophomore elective schedule. that's gonna be fun. art IS my bag, babay, YAH. (i went through all three austin powers movies yesterday, so direct references to the furry little sex symbol will not be few and far between within the next few weeks, i'm afraid. groovy!)  i need to wrap this up and get on with my life, so i'll catch you guys next post. you've been a groovy audience, baby. keep up the good work. ta!  -hannah

      don't you wish winter came more often? i love christmastime..  on a more interesting note: I SURVIVED MY FIRST DAY OF HIGH SKOOL, BABY! altogether now: HIP HIP HURRAH! so yah, it was really exciting and mostly boring..after the bell rang and we got to our first class, i remembered exactly how much i hated school and homework and essays, so yes. i am now totally ready for summer. counting down the days. aside from my getting lost on my way to EVERY class, it was a semi stress free day. and as for the title, i'm listening to my totally new barry manilow CD. why, you ask? well, i'll tell you: because it's christmaaaaaaaas! mwahahahaha. oh yes, not only is it the answer to your question, it is also the title of the CD. hot dang, i'm clever! =P but yah. barry manilow. he kicks some serious butt (edited JUST for you jenny! wuv ya.). and he's hot..well..y'know. for a 50 year old singing dude..shruggage.  i'd love to stay and chat, but y'know, there's this thing i have to get back to..'s called a life. yah, you should try it sometime. =P  toodles, dahling!  -hannio.

      day two of the amazing high skool experience, and what a day it was. but hey, be proud of me; i didn't get lost ONCE and had a vague idea of where i was going today. getting to classes is pretty easy, though. just follow the herd until you pick out someone you recognize, keep behind them and hop on the stress free instant class express. unless you get really turned around and end up in the wrong building and whatnot. in that case you keep walking chin up, head high and try to look like this isn't new to you. of course, there are other ways of getting to class, too. have somebody come LOOK for you and grab you and escort you to your class, which i was supposed to do today and forgot. sorry dash!   i've been trying to get jenny to play the 'helpless lost freshman' card and wander around in circles for about an hour. that would be so hilarious if they went looking for you and found you all curled up in a janitor closet somewhere. who knows..maybe i'm just twisted.   i would like to take this opportunity to let everyone know how much i DESPISE getting up at 5:30 every morning. hate hate hate hate HATE it. thanks for being such a groovy listener, babe. :P  hot dang, it's burning up in my room. i'll leave you guys here while i go stick my head in the freezer.  kisses n cuddles (yah. you try taking someone seriously from then on when they say that to you.) -hannah.
