      THE WAIT POEM   by Russell Kelfer    Desperately, helplessly, longingly, I cried;  Quietly, patiently, lovingly, God replied.  I pled and I wept for a clue to my fate...  and the Master so gently said,"Wait."   "Wait? you say wait?" my indignant reply.  "Lord, I need answers, I need to know why!"  Is your hand shortened? Or have you not heard?  By faith I have asked, and I'm claiming your Word.   My future and all to which I relate  hangs in the balance and you tell me to Wait?"  I'm needing a 'yes', a go-ahead sign.  Or even a 'no,' to which I'll resign.   You promised, dear Lord, that if we believe,  We need but to ask, and we shall receive.  Lord, I've been asking, and this is my cry:  I'm weary of asking! I need a reply.   Then quietly, softly, I learned of my fate  as my Master replied again, "Wait."  So I slumped in my chair, defeated and taut,  and grumbled to God, "So, I'm waiting...for what?"   He seemed then to kneel, and His eyes met with mine...  and He tenderly said, "I could give you a sign.  I could shake the heavens and darken the sun.  I could raise the dead and cause mountains to run.   I could give all you seek and pleased you would be.  You'd have what you want, but you wouldn't know Me.  You'd not know the depth of My love for each saint.  You'd not know the power that I give to the faint.   You'd not learn to see through clouds of despair;  you'd not learn to trust just by knowing I'm there.  You'd not know the joy of resting in Me  when darkness and silence are all you can see.   You'd never experience the fullness of love  when the peace of My spirit descends like a dove.  You would know that I give, and I save, for a start,  But you'd not know the depth of the beat of My heart.   The glow of My comfort late into the night,  the faith that I give when you walk without sight.  The depth that's beyond getting just what you ask  From an infinite God who makes what you have last.   You'd never know should your pain quickly flee,  what it means that My grace is sufficient for thee.  Yes, your dearest dreams overnight would come true,  but oh, the loss if I lost what I'm doing in you.   So, be silent, my child, and in time you will see  that the greatest of gifts is to truly know me.  And though oft My answers seem terribly late,  My most precious answer of all is still "WAIT".

      I have to tell you all about this strange dream that I had this past weekend. I dreamt that that Texas Chainsaw Massacre family was in Bay City and trying to fatten up my family. I know that it sounds funny here, but I'm telling you I was so scared to get out of bed. Chris was at work and it was just me and the 2 dogs at home. Do you think it's the Clomid messing with me?   My husband ate the rest of my left over steak. I was thinking all morning about eating my left over steak with a salad an some asparagus for lunch and when I went to the frig to get the stuff out, I couldn't find my steak. I looked over everything and still couldn't find. I was as angry and disappointed to see a plate in the sink that had left over seasoning on it from my steak. I just ate my salad and asparagus for lunch. When my Dh (and that's not for dear ) got up I told him how I was all set to eat my left over steak for lunch when I noticed that I couldn't find it in the frig. He just looked at me and was trying not to smile and said, "I don't know who took your steak". Well, he finally admitted that he took it, but didn't realize that I wanted to have it. The next time he said that he will ask me if I want it.

      I almost fell down the stairs when I looked out the window and saw the snow on the roof and on the ground. It was so cold, too. Only 32° and today was suppose to get to 60°, but it is currently 35° and rainy. When will spring finally be here in Michigan?   I am currently 2dpiui. I can't not stop thinking about being pregnant. I know that it's too early to even think that I am, but every little cramp or twitch in my stomach makes me think that I am. I think alot of it has to do with this cycle being a clomid and a IUI cycle. This is the first cycle for both with me and my Dh. I can tell that he is getting excited. Since the IUI he has been so happy and talking about a baby more then ever before. He was great at the IUI and wanted to make sure that IF there is another one, that he will be there, again. At this IUI, once the doctor had the catheter inserted, she asked my Dh if he wanted to push the plunger on the syringe. He just smiled and said, "Sure". Later on that night he couldn't stop talking about it. Especially after I told him that some of the girls that I talk to on the board said that they have never heard of the husband pushing the plunger of the syringe. He is so special.

      I called in the morning to schedule my IUI for today. I went in at 10. Chris gave his "sample" in the office and then the nurse "spun" it in front of his. This is suppose to take an hour, but the spinning only was about 30 minutes. The doctor came in and got the sample and put the catheter in me. She asks Chris if he would like to push down the plunger of the syringe. He does.&nbsp;

      I got a positive on my Fertility Monitor this morning. Plus, a positive on my OPK in the afternoon. This means that I will be ovulating soon. I also had ovulation pain around 7:00 p.m.

      Not too surprised. We knew that we would probably not get pregnant on our own. I am being put on 50mg of Clomid starting on CD2 and I will take it for the next 5 days. Once I ovulate, then I will have my Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).

      I've been pretty bad about keeping up with this. I was hoping to write something also daily about what I've been feeling, but when I've been at my lowest I just stay away from everyone. Since my last post I found out that&nbsp;a co-worker was also pregnant. That was another blow! I was happy for her. Her and her Dh had been trying for 2 years so it was about time for them, too, but still in my heart I was wishing it was me. I'm will be there for her through it all, but my heart will still ache when ever she talks about the baby.   My niece had a m/c plus a d/c this past week. That hit me hard, too. I felt so bad for her and kept thinking how sad that she must feel. I was also thinking back to when I found out. Did I do something to wish that this would happen to her? A definate NO!! I could never wish that on anyone. I saw her on Saturday and told her how sorry that I was. She said that she was doing fine and that they play on waiting to try, again. She also told me how sorry she was for me. She said that she can only imagine how I must have felt on Mother's Day finding out that SHE was pregnant. I told her that, Yes, I was very sad to hear about her pregnancy, but then I was so happy for her, too. She really will make a great mom someday.   I had my 2nd IUI done on May 25th. I felt much better after this one. The 1st one I had a ton of cramping during and after it was done. Plus, I spotted the day of the IUI and the next 4 days after. I spotting, again, around 6dpiui and got all excited that that might be implantation. It, of course wasn't. This time Chris did his thing at home and I took his sample in myself. There was some cramping when the IUI was actually, done and a little bit of spotting that same day, but I felt fine after it and the next fews days later, too. I'm hoping to test on Monday, June 8th. I keep hearing how the 2nd and 3rd IUI's are usually the most successfully for people. I hope that it true.

      I went into work last night to get my schedule for the upcoming week. While there, a co-worker of mine "subtly" asked if I was pregnant? When I told her about my Mother's Day she almost started crying and just kept asking how I was doing. I was surprised at how well I felt at that moment to tell her that I wasn't pregnant, but we will be trying again. I told her, though, that I don't think I will be telling everyone when my next IUI is (except you all  ) because I don't want people to always ask if this is the month for IUI #  . She was surprised at how well I was taking it. I'm just glad that I finally told someone at work that I'm not pregnant. That way when I go back to work on Monday, they shouldn't be all over me asking. (I hope.  )

      These are two of my favorite quotes . The last quote I found when I was at my lowest point in this whole TTC stuff.     "The best thing you can do for the future is to live with everything you have in the present"    &nbsp;  It just seemed to fit my life at the time and, I think, it still does. I try not to live for the future, but for just right now. It's hard at times to imagine what my life would be like with children in it or not in it, for that matter. If I spend all of my waking moments on that, then nothing else in my life would matter. So living for NOW is my only option.     "Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming -- WOW -- What a Ride!"     My boss sent this to me after I told her that my insurance FINALLY approved my  urlLink Hysterosalpingogram{HSG}  and  urlLink Sims Huhner{post~coital}  test. How appropriate, don't you think? I hope that when my DH and I are old and gray and sitting on our porch we both can say, "WOW!! What a ride!".

      Still waiting to see if anything is happening. Really really really want to test on Wednesday, but I know that&nbsp;I'll only be 9dpiui and I might not see anything. I'm going to try to hold off until Saturday or Sunday. I keep feeling things, but I'm trying not to get my hopes up. I've been feeling some twinges all last night and all today. We shall see. I really hate the 2ww. Only 1 more to go. Can I make it?   What a great morning we had. The   was shining, of course. I had to work today and wasn't able to enjoy it.&nbsp;  I should really start taking the doggies for walks, again.

      I can't believe what a long day it was today. Only 3 more days left until my VACATION starts. Chris and I are just staying home. We don't really have the money right now to go away. Maybe on our next vacation in August. I'll probably just clean the house and get the yard all straighten out. And hopefully find out that I'm going to be a mom!! Wouldn't that be the best?

       I remember a song that we used to sing in kindergarten. It went something like this.    "Good Morning. Good Morning. Good Morning to you.  Good Morning. Good Morning. Good Morning to you, you, you, you, you and you."

      Af is definitely here, but treating me well, if that is at all possible. It sucks that IUI #2 didn't work. I know that I'm ovulating and I know that Chris's counts were good so why the&nbsp;HELL isn't anything working for us? It just doesn't make since. When I have the next IUI I'm going to ask about the spotting that I had this cycle. I normally spot a couple of days before Af, but this cycle it was about 5. I also had a really bad cold with a high fever so maybe something happened with all of that. We'll never know, though. Maybe I have a problem with progesterone?   That's what I'll ask at my next IUI appointment.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Such sad news. Both my niece and my co-worker&nbsp;had m/c! I feel so bad for the two of them. They both seem to be doing well and say that they will try again real soon. I believe that they were both due around the same time (1/12/05).   Nothing much is new with me. Still in the 2ww and it's driving me crazy. I hope that I can hold out to next week to test. I don't have any tests in the house, so maybe that'll help.

      I'm am really hoping that Diane wins HoH tonight. Last I heard Nakomis was out. Now if only Scott and Jase drop out and then Marvin. One of the ladies or Will has to win HoH. They are the only ones who would put Jase or Scott up for eviction.  I guess I'll just have to wait until tomorrow to find out. I think a few people in my Groups has the Live Feed.

       I don't get to watch Spongebob Square Pants all that often, but while I was at my sister's yesterday my nieces where watching it. The episode that we watched was called, "Krusty Krab Training Video". This episode is a training video for new employees of the Krusty Krab. The video goes over the basics of being an employee, such as: Good Hygiene, clean work area, being a good employee, and dealing with the customer. And of course, the unforgetable POOP session. There was a narrator in this "video" and he was telling the viewers to &nbsp;remember POOP when waiting on a customer.    Narrator:  Let's see if POOP works. Here's a customer... Let's watch...  Customer:  I'd like to order-  Narrator:  Do you think he will order   A:   A sofa,   B:   An expensive haricut, Or   C:   A patty?  Customer:  1 Krabby patty please  Narrator:  AW POOP you never let us down!  &nbsp;

      I did something stupid today. I had    1    hpt&nbsp;left in my bathroom and I took the test. Of course, it was a    BIG FAT NEGATIVE   !!! Just like I knew it would. I'm so sad now. I know that I'm only 9dpiui, but still there are a lot of ladies who test that early and see a positive. Stupid Amy! Stupid! Stupid!

       I hate when I get so down about this whole "TTC" stuff. It's just not healthy. I still don't know if this latest IUI worked or not, but I'm already expecting the worse. I've been crying and wondering why it still isn't happening for me. Will it ever happen? At this moment in time, I don't think it will. I know it sounds like I'm giving up, but that just might be what happens. I haven't talked to my doctor, yet, but I know that he will have some suggestions. One of which will be me having a  urlLink LAP &nbsp;done. Which I'm not sure will even help me. What to do? What to do?

       I was hanging out at my sister's house today. Did some swimming and then we had pizza. We all got to talking about our pets. Every time I would talk about my dogs, I would call them my babies. Well, after, about, the 4th time calling them my babies, Alexis said {in her 5 year old voice}, "You have babies?" I said, "Well, sort of. They are my dogs, Kasey and Bailey." Alexis asks, "Did they live in your belly?" "Well, No, they didn't. They are dogs Alexis."   We tried not to laugh at her, but she was so serious. She knows that babies stay in their mom's "belly" until they are born. She just assumed that my "babies" came from my belly, too.

       My husband is such a baby! He was looking for a magazine that comes in the mail once in a while. He asked me if I knew where it was? I said, "I might have thrown it out". He starts yelling at me that I'm not allowed to touch his stuff like that! Those magazine costs money! Who's money?! Not his! They are a free magazine that just comes in the mail. I actually thought that he was done with it, so I tossed it into our paper pile. Well I was wrong. He then starts in on me about his other magazine called "Handyman" that he keeps getting a subscription to each Christmas from his parents. Now, for some reason he has to keep every one of those magazines. He says, "I might want to make something out of it someday". Yeah! Like that is ever going to happen. He can't even finish stuff that he has started around this house. Anyway, he really is yelling at me and pointing his finger right in my face to leave his fucken stuff alone. I yell back that, yes, I might have thrown the free magazine away, but I haven't touched his "Handyman" ones since the last time. {I did try to throw some away a few years ago.} These stupid magazines are just laying around the house. If they were that important to him, then I think he would be putting them in a safe place like a Rubbermaid container or something like that. I can't believe how I'm still shaking because of this argument! He just makes me so made. Every time we get into any kind of fight he always brings up my spending habits. I do have credit card debt, but my credit cards are cut up and I'm trying my hardest to pay them off. I don't need him to keep throwing that in my face every time, but he does. What a baby!   Well, he finally went to bed. {He works 3rd shift.} I went out onto the porch and looked for this free magazine. I found it along with some other free ones that he might want. I found his latest "Handyman" and went up stairs and through each and every one of them at home and called him a   Fucken Fuckhead  . {Not sure where that came from, but it sounded good.} I'm starting to feel a little bit better. I'm still very mad at him, but I'm trying not to get too stressed out. I'm currently 7dpiui and  IF  I pregnant, I don't want anything to happen.

      I am so excited. Chris and I are going camping in a couple of weeks with my brother and his family. We went 3 years ago with them and had a blast. This year my brother bought a camper. Chris and I will stay in a tent. Chris wasn't too happy to hear that we were staying for 7 days in a tent. He doesn't think he can handle being in a tent for that long. I don't foresee a problem. If my sister-in-law, who was 8 months pregnant, was able to stay in a tent for over a week, I think we should have no problems. I've been trying to make a list as to what we will need. It's a lot harder then I thought to plan all of this. I hope that I won't forget something, but I have a feeling that I will. We also have to make plans for someone to stay here with the dogs. I would LOVE to take them with us, but with us staying in a tent, I'm afraid that they might rip a hole in it and escape. Next year, with our tax money, we are planning on getting a camper. When that happens, the dogs will be able to come with us. Until then, they will stay here with my nieces and their friends for 3 nights and then with my older sister for the remainder 3 nights. I will miss my doggies terribly, but I know that they will be with people who love them as much as we do.

      I don't know what is wrong with me. I'm just not happy anymore. I hate my job! No big surprise there. I just am not happy anymore when I go to work and it's starting to show. Yesterday I was a bear to be around. A girl that works in another department was standing next to my boss and asked me what I worked on Sunday {today}. I told her that I never know anymore what I work. That I have to check my schedule everyday before leaving for work. I then went into the freezer to get some stuff. She came into the freezer and asked me, again, what I worked. I told her that I really don't know anymore. She then tells me that my boss said that the reason that I don't want to tell her when I work is because I don't want to go on breaks with her. I just told her that my boss is just trying to start something. When I left the freezer my boss was looking at me and laughing. I just walked away. Later that night the same girl came back over to me and said that my boss told her that since I lost my full time that I have had an attitude. DO YOU THINK SO?!!!! Well, of course I have an attitude. Wouldn't anyone else in my shoes have one? I'm trying to not to stress out about my job, but it's so hard,&nbsp; NOT  to. Will this ever get better? I hope so. I don't think that I will have anymore friends left at work if I don't change my attitude.

      I'm am caught between a rock and a hard place.  My mom and my oldest sister.  These two  fine  ladies live together and just can't get along. I don't know if it's because they are so alike or so different. Either way, they have involved me in one of their discussions and I don't want to be involved.   It all started when one of my younger nieces called an invited my mom, sister,&nbsp;Dh and I to her birthday party on Friday, July 23rd, around 6:30 p.m. My sister and my mom normally go grocery shopping around that time. The party interferes with their shopping. My mom asks me if I can take her shopping earlier in the day. No problem! That way I can take her to the party in case my sister doesn't want to go. Today I get a call from my sister saying that I don't need to take mom shopping earlier. That she can still take her. Once they get home, she can put my mom's groceries away and I can take mom to the party. Fine! Then my mom calls and says that my sister says that I don't want to take her shopping. That she is bothering me. {Which I didn't say at all!} I tell mom that I have no problem taking her shopping, but I think that she and my sister really need to talk and get things out in the open. I told her that I don't want to be in the middle of them. I will take her shopping, but she needs to tell my sister that.   What a day! I know that my sister will either e-mail me or call me up later to talk, again, about me taking my mom shopping. My mom hates change, but she also hates it when things start to get to "busy". Not sure if that is the right word I'm looking for. I know that my mom misses me. I used to take her grocery shopping all of the time before my sister took up the duty a few months back. My mom always wanted to go shopping on Monday mornings and that didn't always work out for her. I sometimes had to take her shopping right after work and that was a pain! {I work in the same place that my mom grocery shops.}   I know that I will be taking my mom shopping. She is very stubborn and has to have things her way.

       Today was my 3rd IUI. Everything went well, I believe. The doctor said that there were a lot of great "swimmers" and that's all that we can hope for. The catheter went in a lot easier, too, this time. The first time I had some cramping and bleeding. The second time there was a ton of cramping because the catheter wouldn't go in correctly, plus there was a "student" trying to do it that time. There was also a lot of bleeding. This time the catheter went right in, no cramping at all. There was some spotting, but that  is  normal.   &nbsp;  Now I have to wait 2 long weeks to find out if I'm pregnant.&nbsp;  I hope that they go by fast.

      My back went out on me, again! I hate when this happens. It's my lower back on the left side. It hurts to sit for too long and when I go to bed I have to get into bed a certain way or else I'm in a lot of pain. The only time my back actually felt good was while I was working. My back didn't hurt at all during that time. I was on my feet and doing a lot of walking. When I went on break, it started all over, again, until I went back to work. I should really go and see a doctor, but I'm just to lazy to do that.

       I've already gone through 2 IUI's, both with negative results. I was suppose to do IUI #3 last cycle, but with the stress from work, I never knew that I was ovulating. I called my doctor's office yesterday to get a scrip for my 50mg of Clomid. My doctor's assistant calls me back and tells me that if this IUI doesn't work, then the doctor will want to talk to me about my other options! At this point in the game I have no other options. With my hours getting cut way back and insurance only covering a total of 4 IUI's, there isn't much more that can be done. I've been thinking alot about this lately. We both really want kids, but we might not ever have any and we both have to realize that. Adoption can be an option, but, again, money is involved and we just don't have any. What to do! What to do!

      I think most of us do, but I really, really do hate my job!   A couple of weeks ago we found out that our department was going from 7 full timers and 13 part timers to only 2 full timers and 7 part timers. I  WAS  full time and now I'm part time. I went from 40 hour weeks to only 28 hour weeks, but with the potential of only 12 hour weeks during our slow times. Also, I have been working mornings since 1999/2000 and now I'm on nights. I've been there since 1995 and that doesn't mean a whole lot when others have been there since 1988. I hope that I will get over these awful feelings that I have been having about my job. I'm just not happy any more when it comes to that   place  . I have been so stressed out that my husband and I missed my  PEAK  time, but that is a whole other story.

      One of my favorite movies is called Office Space!   Some of my favorite lines&nbsp;from the movie are:   Joanna: So, where do you work, Peter?  Peter Gibbons: Initech.  Joanna: In...yeah, what do you do there?  Peter Gibbons: I sit in a cubicle and I update bank software for the 2000 switch.  Joanna: What's that?  Peter Gibbons: Well see, they wrote all this bank software, and, uh, to save space, they used two digits instead of four. So, like 98 instead of 1998? Uh... so I go through these thousands of lines of code and, uh... it doesn't really matter. I uh... I don't like my job, and, uh... I don't think I'm gonna go anymore.  Joanna: You're just not gonna go?  Peter Gibbons: Yeah.  Joanna: Won't you get fired?  Peter Gibbons: I don't know, but I really don't like it, and, uh, I'm not gonna go.  Joanna: So you're gonna quit?  Peter Gibbons: Nah-uh. Not really. Uh... I'm just gonna stop going.  Joanna: When did you decide all that?  Peter Gibbons: About an hour ago.  Joanna: An hour ago... so you're gonna get another job?  Peter Gibbons: I don't think I'd like another job.  Joanna: Well, what are you going to do about money and bills and...  Peter Gibbons: You know... I've never really liked paying bills. I don't think I'm gonna do that, either.   How many of us have felt like this? I know that I have. I wish that I could just say that I'm not going to work anymore and about those bills...I don't feel like paying on them anymore. Just because I don't like to.

      I can't belive that vacation time is already here. I'm so excited to be finally going. Dh and I are going camping with my brother and his family. We haven't been camping since 2001. We were going to take our two dogs with us, but we are only staying in a tent and I know that my one dog would some how ripe a hole in the tent to get out and I don't want that to happen. Next summer we are hoping to have a camper. So, we have my nieces and their friends staying for the week. They are just as excited to be away from their home, too. I'm going to try to keep a log of our vacation. I hope to be able to share some of it with you all.  Until then.......

      I was so angry on Friday. Well, actually, I was very happy on Friday and then I went to work and saw the new schedule. I was set on seeing that I would be working Friday until Wednesday and then have Thurs, Fri and Sat off and then start my vacation. That wasn't the case. My boss denied two of the days that I had asked off. She gave me Monday and Saturday off and then I'm supposed to start vacation. Why, why, why does she always do this to me?!!! I asked her why I didn't get them off and all she could say was she couldn't give them to me. Whatever! I noticed that she asked for the weekend off. Her boss never denies her days off. I just really dislike my boss at the moment. If she couldn't give them to me, then why didn't she come up to me and just tell me that she couldn't? I think she likes to see me get upset. And I was. I was on the verge of tears so many times that night. When I get really angry like that I just want to cry. The rest of my Friday was awful. I think this was one of the worse nights that I have ever had at work. Just before leaving I quickly wrote a night to my boss asking for a morning shift, at least, on Friday. When I went into work on Saturday I noticed that I would be getting out at 2p.m. I'm so happy now. Not as happy as I would have been if I had gotten what I actually wanted, but happy still.

      Dh and I were in  urlLink Saginaw  yesterday along with my 11 year old niece. We were trying to price mattresses and couches at a furniture store. On our way back to  urlLink Bay City   I noticed some people standing on all four corners of a intersection. They were all yelling and holding up signs. At first, I couldn't tell what they were saying or holding up, but as we got closer I could tell that they were holding up pictures of aborted babies. I was just so shocked that people were doing this right there in a busy intersection. I told my niece to close her eyes and not to look at all. These pictures were so disgusting! I will tell you that I am against abortion, but I don't need to see the pictures to tell me that it's wrong. These pictures were so very graphic and to top it all off, these people also had their kids holding up pictures and signs. These kids were my nieces age and younger. The kids were holding up signs reading, "I can have a BIRTHDAY, but others only have a DEATHDAY!" or something like that. I was just so angry that these people were doing this. I just wanted to cry.  Chris said that you could tell that these people do this all of the time. There were trucks and trailers just parked and opened as if they were ready to leave at any moment. When we got home I turned the t.v. on to see if it was on the news. I started to watch the t.v. and nothing was on about these people, but there was news that the president was in Saginaw at the same time that this was happening. My only guess was that these people knew that the president would have to drive by them. I just think that there are better ways to get through to people. We all don't need to see the pictures. JMO!

      Sometimes I can't believe that I'm married. When I was in my 20's and if someone was to say that, "You will get married when you are in your 30s" I would have just laughed in their faces or tell them to be quiet! Well, they would have been correct.  In my entire life I have only had 3 serious "boyfriends". {My Dh being one of them.} My first BF was a complete jerk! He would say that he wanted to marry me, wanted to have children with me, but he could never hold a job. He would tell me that he was working at a certain place. On any give day that he said that he was going to work, I would call the place to talk to him to see how his day was going. The secretary at the desk would just kept saying, "I'm sorry, but nobody by that name works here!" I would then ask my BF what's up with that, when I saw him later in the day and he would always have a quick response that "the secretary is new and she doesn't know who he is, yet" or "I'll straighten this out when I go to work tomorrow". Well, tomorrow would come, I would call, again, and get the same response. After about a month of this he finally comes clean and tells me that he doesn't work there "anymore". I finally push and he admits that he never worked there, but was embarrassed to tell me the truth. My next question would always be, then where were you? Oh well, I won't dwell on him anymore. I usually call those 2 years that I was with him my "Lost Years".  The next BF I had I was only with him for 6 months. It took him almost 2 months before he would kiss me and I just have to say that his kisses did nothing for me. He would always tell me to come and visit him at his parents place. I would get there he would always have a "friend" over. Not a female friend, but always a male friend. I would sit on the couch while he and his friend played video games. What a great BF I had, NOT! I tried to bring it up about his friend always being there and he would get angry and say that he has known "Tom" for a lot longer then me and I won't be telling him who he can hang out with. Okay! When the 6 month mark of us being together got there he tells me that he wants to break up. That he only wants to be friends with me. Well, I just told him that he can't have the best of both worlds, and never looked back at him. Thank God! I saw him recently and he's dating, again. His friend!  Now onto my Dh! When I started working at my current job I never in my life thought that I would met anyone there. I went to work and at that time, really enjoyed my job. {Now I don't, but that was already posted a while back under the title  urlLink "I hate my job!" }. I had seen my "Dh" always working and sometimes I would get up enough nerve and say Hi from time to time. I would always walk with my head down just so I wouldn't make eye contact with ANYONE! A lot of times I would almost run into my "Dh" and we would laugh and then go back to our departments. I didn't know that he was always "hunting" me out when I would run into him like that. When I finally figured out that he might actually like me it was in the summer of my first year at the job. A mutual friend of ours told him that I would like to go out with him and told me that he would like to go out with me. He finally asked me out in August of 95 and we had our first date on September 5, 1995! We got engaged October 7, 1999 and finally began our life together as husband and wife on April 7, 2001!  Dh and I lived together before we were married and a lot of people said that once we got married nothing would change. Well, they were wrong. Things in our relationship got totally better since we said "I Do". My Dh is my best friend. We have so much in common with each other. We are always laughing at something or another and we both love the same things. Our dogs are our life and we would do anything for them. We both want kids, but will understand if we aren't able to have them. Every day that I see my Dh I just love him more and more. I can't imagine not having him in my life. We don't see each other very much. He works 3rd shift and I work 2nd. When I'm getting up for the day, he is just going to sleep. I leave for work while he is sleeping and when I get home he is leaving for work. He's trying to get on another shift. Plus, he's going to school to get a better job. We talk about moving from time to time away from our family's and friend's. He thinks that I'm afraid to leave them all, and I am, but I know that I will be fine because I will have Him by my side. My best friend! My lover! My life!

      I don't know why I'm still in my pjs. I have been up and out of bed since 8:30a.m., but haven't done much since then. I ate my breakfast (Corn pops), I am still enjoying my morning coffee (I sometimes drink the whole pot of coffee.) and I've taken my vitamin and thyroid medicine already. The only two things that I haven't done, yet, is brush my teeth and take a shower. Pretty disgusting ain't it? ;o)  Well, it's my day off from work. The house work is all done and I just feel like being lazy. I'm in a great mood today (which is unusual for me lately). I was going to call my doctor up today and let him know that the 3rd IUI didn't work, but I've changed my mind. I think that I'm going to do nothing about our TTC stuff, at all, during this cycle. Dh and I are going camping on the 14th and I don't want to have to worry about anything to do with TTC during this time. I want Dh and I to just enjoy ourselves and not stress out about my ovulation time or anything else.  Lets see....what else was I thinking of doing today? Hmm.....I think I'm suppose to mail some bills and call the dentist. Hopefully I'll get to those things today, but who really knows. I will eventually shower and right after I finish this post I will brush my teeth, but other then those things nothing else is planned. :o)

       urlLink Families: Stop Looking for Lori   This is so sad. Even though there are things going on in my life they can't even compare to what Lori's family is feeling. I just knew that her husband killed her. I hope that the authorities can find her body.

      I don't even know why I bothered to buy the stupid hpt. I took it this morning because my temp was still relatively high, but guess what that hpt read? BFN!!! Just like I knew it would.   I give up!   I have no idea why we can't get pregnant. This just totally sucks. I have to call my doctor tomorrow to let them know that the 3rd IUI didn't work and to find out what my options are.  I just don't get it! Why can some people get pregnant without even trying and others can't get pregnant and they are practically knocking themselves out in the process? I'm sad, frustrated, angry, confused.....I just really want a baby! Why can't I have one? Did I do something wrong? Does God hate me and is punishing me? Are my Dh and I awful people who don't deserve a baby of our own?    I just want to scream!!!!     My Dh doesn't know, yet, that I tested. I know that he will think it's all his fault that it didn't happen, again. It's nobodies  fault. I know that. I just have to convince myself that. It's so hard to get through each day and not know why. I hope this gets easier, but I have a feeling that I'm in for a looooong journey.  I have more thoughts running through my head, but I just can't seem to get exactly how I'm feeling down onto this screen.
