       Hey everyone!&nbsp; We finished the first camp yesterday.&nbsp; Today was our "day off" and I did some work (preparing for next camp), then some of us went to LA to go to a Dogers game!&nbsp; It was sold out, due to the Bobble Head movement on the West Coast...can't believe it!!!&nbsp; So we drove down Hollywood Blvd. (what's your dream!?), and went to Chicken n' Waffles (for me it was just "Waffles"), then came back to campus.&nbsp; Tomorrow we realign with the staff and prepare for the next camp with starts on Sunday.&nbsp; The last camp was with the younger kids, ages 8-11-ish for 8 days.&nbsp; The next two camps are ages 11-13-ish for 10 days.&nbsp; Go check out the pictures if you get a chance...there are some good ones of me on Day 10.&nbsp;  Hope all is well on the East Side!&nbsp; I miss you guys, fill me in on things!&nbsp; Talk to you soon. Sue

       Hey all!&nbsp; Things are going well in Cali.&nbsp; A big hectic though.&nbsp; But I'm thinking of you guys, especially since tomorrow's the touniment!&nbsp; Definately post the pictures...and feel free to play my song to remember me, haha!&nbsp; I heard Dremos was fun...literaly, I heard it when Jeff informed me of his pee and of crazy overtime with Brett and Jules.&nbsp; What was the status with that? Well it's the second day campers are here.&nbsp; We have little ones!&nbsp; They're sooooo cute...and homesick.&nbsp; Tomorrow's Outdoor Adventure, when they go on the ropes course for the day and have a blast.&nbsp; I finally got to do some laundry today, it's been busy here.&nbsp; The people I'm working with are really great.&nbsp; I miss you guys!&nbsp; I have a picture in my room of the Llama crew all throwing a dart (no, not a softball believe it or not) at the same time hung up in my room.&nbsp; OK, more updates soon. &nbsp; P.S. If you're interested in some pictures (mostly none of me, but of the program I'm running), check out  urlLink www.SuperCamp.com  and click on "photos" (or the picture of the camera).&nbsp; The username is "photos" and the password is "thisisit".&nbsp;

       Casey and Joe have a new puppy...beagle mix...and of course   soooo cute  !  Name is Scout (but we were thinking of naming her Six as she has this random extra toenail on the inside of her left or right hind leg about 1/3 of the way up the leg).   AND  she had her first pee since coming home from the shelter on our upstairs living room floor yesterday (at Joe and my house)!

       Sue - As you're going through your exciting, tiring days out there you may just want to take a break every now and then, think of some things from home, and smile. Here's a sampling...  -Mitch's Bitches -Grommet  -Doing stuff to make you "laugh" -Toby getting "excited" as he rounds the bases in anticipation of his reward. -Grazing -Dearborn parties -Iiit was the pickle! -Do It! -Another S&J victory at darts -Jules knocking over beer pong cups -Jules taking the "Hey Ya" DJ -Jules -O--K--A--Y -Evite responses -Another Llamas victory

       Hey all from   !!!  Most of you know I left on Wednesday, and I flew out of BWI.  My travels were very interesting.  First, I got to the airport about 6 hours early (I knowingly did this), which wasn't bad at all.  You should know I was able to keep myself entertained, plenty.  I got on the plane that had a layover in Houston, then from Houston to Ontario (California, not Canada).  So my flight to Houston was great, I had no one sitting next to me, and next to the empty seat was a kid who was young enough to be cute and old enough to be quiet...perfect!  Get on my transfer plane to Ontario...make my way to the back of the plane where I am sitting next to an obese couple.  So I'm sitting half on the seat and half in the isle...for the entire 3 hours, in the back of the plane, near the bathroom, and where they prepare the food...so I'm getting bumped around the whole time.    But I finally made it, and things have been crazy since I arrived (crazy good).  I've met some great people I'll be working with this summer.  But we're about to go to bed.  Give me some stories!!!  I miss you all, hope to hear from you soon.  Love, Sue
