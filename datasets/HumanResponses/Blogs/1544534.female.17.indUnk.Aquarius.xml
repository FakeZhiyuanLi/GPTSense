      Voici- so, here are the rhymes with which I have done my prefacing, and their attributations.   I have never forgotten you, Nor ever shall forget- How, unworthy e'en of malice, I earned this abandonment.  -Marie Andouille  A chatar m'er de so qu'ien non volria, tant me rancur de lui cui sui amia, car l'am mais que nuilla ren que sia.   Countess of Dia  (Translation by Meg Bogin, dissertation, "The Women Troubadors", circa 1980)

      The easiest part of this entire retelling is the beginning, the root of it all. For, you see, it began with one man, with a man, and a girl who fell in love.   I was not an unusual child in most aspects. I tell you this now so that you will understand how much I have changed, first because of Damien, and second, because of my years and my experience. I was not unusually beautiful, at least not as a girl, nor particularly brilliant, though I would be judged clever, quick. I was not especially wealthy, either, nor from some secret race with tainted blood. I was simply Marie Andouille, the only daughter of Edouard and Marie Andouille. (My parents did not look far for my name.)  I do not remember my parents well. They were both, God rest their souls, entirely unremarkable for their time. My father was a merchant, a glorified tinker, really, who criscrossed the shifting borders of still less permanent nations to carry goods to faires.  Unlike government and civility, trade did not cease upon the outbreak of war, only found ways to avoid the conflict.   Indeed, my parents were entirely average, even at the two things at which they excelled: devotion to their pocketbook and to their god. In truth, in those times, the two went hand in hand, at least to an extent: the Huguenots were rising in the south, and the kings were scrapping over the throne in the north, and their respective churches drained the treasuries of all concerned in the name of a god that did not care for riches, only for love. Said churches also funded and passionately supported the bloody massacres that followed. So much for love.  Both of my parents were devout, but then so was everyone at that time. Even the heretics were devout. It was a pious era, if you were willing to believe that the words men mouthed were prayers, not lies or curses. Perhaps even less surprising, neither of my parents was rich- poverty was far more common in those days than ever the Plague would be.   And so, in a markedly common environment, I was born a remarkably common baby. And grew to be a similarly common girl, truth be known. I stood out only in that I was perhaps a bit more attractive than most, having inherited probably more than my fair share of my parents' good traits. From my mother I gained a head of dark, thick hair, much like the sable my father dreamed of trading. I never knew the color of my father's hair- by the time I grew old enough to understand color, he had only a few whisps of hair left, and even fewer teeth. I did get his complexion, however, his tawny skin, so dark to eyes accustomed to the pallid skin found north of the Alps. As well, I took my mother's delicate features, her childish lips, even her wide eyes and spindly eyelashes. But where my mother's eyes were a pale, fragile blue, and my father's black as obsidian, mine were brown, brown with little green flecks, a color that a jongleur I once met called hazel.   Looking back, and looking at my own face, I know my mother must have once been an incredibly beautiful woman, but by the time I grew old enough to see her as she was, she was travel-worn, care- worn, well-worn, and simply worn, with lines on every inch of her face, and a particularly deep set of wrinkles between her lips and her nose, the result of a sense of dissatisfaction with her state. She rarely had anything to say to anyone, even me, and her eyes followed my father everywhere as if they were goads, constantly gouging him, reminding him of all he had failed to give her.   Not until my parents were dead did I finally come to understand their marriage and the circumstances behind it, but even as a little girl, I understood that they were not happy, and that made me unhappy, dissatisfied and restless in a vague sort of way.  But that restlessness had no outlet until trade in the cities started to go sour, and my father began peddling for a living. At first it was a temporary thing, a stopgap measure. Then we were doing a year trip, maybe a two year trip at most.  But of course, once we were away from the comparative prosperity of the great cities, Marsellies and the wealth of Provencal, we sank deeply into poverty, and shared the fate of the peasants around us. Though we were marginally better off, being capable of traveling to increase our lot, neither of my parents ever forgot that they deserved more, for their piety, their frugality, their dreams.  It made them extremely tiresome, to tell the truth.   It was not that I did not love my parents. Actually, quite the opposite. I adored them with all of my child's fervor and devotion. But as I grew older, it grew harder and harder to deny that my parents were not all that I wanted to believe them, that their twin gods of money and faith were not mine.   Still, I might have swallowed hard on that discomfort, married another peddler, and spent my entire life vaguely dissatisfied.   If not for Damien.  I was- how old? Eleven, almost twelve, I think, when I found him. At the time I recall thinking him no more than fifteen or sixteen, though in fact, he had the look of a young man perhaps eighteen or twenty. I had snuck away from camp that night.  I could lie and say I something poetic, that I wanted to see the moon or the stars, but what I really wanted was just to get away from the seething tension there, the echoes of the small and vicious fight my parents had shared earlier that morning. Odd is it not, how two people not speaking to each other can say volumes?   Regardless- I had skittered off into the brush, and my parents, absorbed in their stubborn little dispute, were busy boiling away and pretending they didn't see one another.   I was only eleven, of course, and in retrospect, leaving the welcoming lights of my family's wagon, of the little group of peddlers and performers and vagabonds and thieves we'd fallen in with, was probably not the brightest idea I'd ever had. But I was also eleven, and there is a certain property of stupidity that comes with that age, and I had far more than my share of it.   So off I went into the woods, without a backward glance.  In memory, I know, of course, that the woods were in fact a little stand of trees, nothing particularly grand, but to the eyes of a small -and I was tiny- eleven year old, such distinctions are impossible to make.  Every tree there was larger than I was, and there were more of them than I had toes and fingers. Ergo, it was absolutely enormous.   And of course, I still wandered in. And once I was within the trees, outside of the campfire, I began to realize exactly how dark dark could get.  And I wasn't afraid. Not really. It never occurred to me that there was something other than me in that wood.  In memory, of course, I understand that woods do not get that still naturally. That is the silence of a land, and of creatures that are waiting for a predator to strike, that do not move because movement is sound, and sound is death.   At eleven, I thought only that I was safe, and pushed further into the woods.

      Bienvenue. You've found my home.   It is not so lavish as Ely's, so soulless as Ava's. But it is mine, mine for the moment, and mine for all time. When I have passed into dust and memory, and out of even unliving mind, this place shall have yet it's echoes of me. I shall be there, in the height of the oaks and walnut I have planted, in the grace of the saplings that sprout from them. I shall be here in the kits that play, in the crows that circle lazily overhead, and the owls which watch in quiet, pompous silence, from the trees.   These are mine, after all.   I will be here in the faint breeze, in the whisper of lavender on the wind, in the tall, fragile stalks of violet and minty green that coat the hills. It grows here now, and always shall grow, on this hill.   I will be here the poppies that flood the spring fields, the profusion of red and gold. Let others chase silks and gems. Even diamonds in time become dust- but the earth remains, and its blandishments return year after year. The poppies will be here when even the Kindred are dead, destroyed from within by our own plotting, our own longevity, our own weaknesses.   And I will be here, too, in this record, graven into these stone plates. My life, my unlife, recorded here, and saved. Someday one of my childer will come here and read of who I was, what I was. And perhaps understand something more of my time, of me. Of what I was, and what they are, and what we both may yet be.   This is my home, my place, my land. And though I cannot love it as I once did, a part of it in day as well as in night, it is given to me now to be with it, part of it, always.   My name is Marie Andouille. I tell you that so that you may know it, and me, and remember me in your future days, so that I shall live on, even if not in unlife. This record is taken from a journal I kept during the early days of my creation, as a neonate of clan Gangrel. It is past time I retold this story, past time I remembered the woman I was, before my turning. Past time that I remembered where I began, for it is in that beginning that I may find some sense in my burgeoning end.

      Well, my regrets to all who saw the original form of this entry. I swear, I'm not really that pathetic a writer, I was just in a hurry to construct this thing and give it a post so that you could read whatever I ended up writing later.   Anyway, the preliminary information. I, Jen, will be gone from my much beloved hometown in Kansas, charging off to Ithaca, New York, and to the delights of the Telluride Association Summer Program, Cornell One, "He Said, She Said: The Battle of the Sexes in Medieval and Renaissance Literature".  We're reading the Decameron. *eyes cross* Oh, gods, I can't wait. And I'll make sure to put a full list of texts up here very soon, so you guys all know what I'm supposed to be reading. I'm actually toying with reading them all in advance, but I'm not sure if that's overdoing it.   Probably is. Besides, I want to enjoy them unbiased in the class. Then again, maybe a personal bias would be useful ahead of time, give me a strong stance to take in debate.   I need to think about this some more, and to read the literature they've sent a couple more times. Not just the rules I'll be following -not like I wouldn't follow all of those anyway- but the general information about the Factora, about the program, about what we'll be doing besides all of that.   I'm really kinda hoping for a trip to New York, but I just know it's not going to happen.   I'll be leaving a lot behind here, I know.  But particularly with one week of recuperation between me and the end of school, I'm ready to go for it.

      Erk, so I worked for a couple of hours in the computer lab, revising my papers, then shuffled upstairs and crawled into bed for five hours of uninterrupted sleep. I'm still tired, though, which tells me I need more- but maybe I'll be able to really consciously understand the points in discussion, tomorrow morning.   Seminar today was difficult, to say the least. It's not that the material is really hard- we read Ovid's  Heroides   last night, and an article on echoes of the  Heroides   in Heloise's pleas to Abelard, specifically in the Personal Letters portion of their correspondence. The connections are fascinating, and readily evident- not even on the most complex rhetorical level, but on the level of diction, which is the first thing I always look at. There are times that Heloise uses phrases or themes culled almost exactly from the  Heroides , the same pleas, "You gave an oath,", the same phrases, "storm-tossed, wave-troubled". But some part of me looks at all the echoes and whispers, "What if it's not conscious? What if it's more the universality and application of those sentiments, rather than the deliberate echo of a text in debate?"  I understand Heloise was a brilliant rhetoritian -I have to understand that now, and be conscious of the very real level on which she's using her intellect and emotions to maniuplate Abelard, but some part of me refuses to accept that the emotions she's using are feigned for the purpose of maniuplating him. Just as I'm coming to believe that there is a great deal of emotion hidden under Abelard's formulaic and familiar rhetoric, and that unlike Heloise, who uses rhetoric to dramatize and emphasize her emotion, Abelard uses his dialectic to conceal what he may feel, to subliminate his suffering to his will, to the interpretation he has decided to give his situation. (ie: Thank god I've been castrated so I can no longer be tempted. . .) I admire his perserverence and strength, particularly when I'm not reading his querulous writing, and look at his predicament from a distance, but I still find it highly unlikely that, even ten years later, his heart did not sometimes wrench at the memory of what he was, and in the face of what he had become.   More a bit later. . . Pubspeaks now.    * * *   Okay, PubSpeaks over!   Dear god, my brain expanded a few feet in those seminars. First presentation was a really, really competent explanation of computers and of the quantum/DNA technology toward which computer technology is tending.  There was also a momentary debate about the question of consciousness in computers, whether it's possible, to the extent which it is possible, and if it happened, whether it would even be possible to determine that consciousness, since we cannot definitely prove that anyone else is conscious on the level that we are because we cannot share in their view of the world, and thus determine the depths of their perceptions.   Second presentation was also excellent, on a particularly salient issue: the draft. The guy giving the presentation- Alex- is himself a conscientious objector, and he took the stance that the draft was an abrogation of traditional American liberties, and argued from there. While I'm not sure I agree, that the draft is a break with the liberty intended by the American forefathers- or, rather, I don't agree that the Armed services, period, are a break with the liberties intended- I don't agree with the draft, particularly for a war which HAS NOT been declared. THat's a point I didn't understand- up until today, I hadn't really understood that Bush's "War on Terror" isn't official.  And so long as the war is not officiated by Congress -thereby giving Congress the right, as well, to end it if and when it becomes more of a burden on America than a security function (which it has, already)- then it is not, to my mind, the responsibility of the American people, but only of those who choose to make soldiery their career, and the defense of America their lives. I admire those individuals, and I respect them tremendously, but there is a difference between voluntarily entering into the armed services to fulfill and obligation you personally feel to your country, and being forced into the services to fill a place, and die far from home.   The third presentation was by our other Alex -the lass. Aesthetics and Ethics- first, can we even judge art, morally, on an ethical level, and then, drawing from that question, since humanity has been judging art ethically since the beginning of time, and whether we ought or ought not to has had no effect- as art becomes more and more abstract, more personal in its meaning, how do we retain a collective view of its ethics? How, when a piece of art is not representative, but is rather entirely abstract, does one judge it on a moral level, or even can one? It's a fascinating concept, the idea that as art becomes more abstract, as its interpretation becomes a question of personal taste, how its ethics also become smaller and smaller, until the ethical judgement about it cannot be made on a social level. Fascinating debate.   Needless to say, I'm having the time of my life. It's astonishing how here, everything, even something as small as going downtown, becomes an intellectual exercise. And I don't mean that in a bad way, just that this group is capable of carrying on an informed discussion about politics, literature, sexuality, legality, just about any topic- and while hiking up a nearly vertical hill to the Campus Store.  Oh! Went to the Campus Store for the first time today. Fell in love with the place. They have every kind of paint known to human kind, sketchbooks everywhere, and I could only think that if my artsy friends were there, the place would be a blast. They even have the little bendable people that you can use for model structure- except they not only have humans, they have horses and dogs and elephants and-   yeah. It's fantastic. I'm horrible at watercolors, but it was all I could do not to blow a bunch of my cash in there, buying every kind of paint brush, paint, and sketchbook known to man. Just be warned, you guys, I'm bringing back gifts. Lots and lots and lots of gifts. So if you have requests for types of paint or sizes of brushes or kinds of sketchbooks, tell me. The prices are really reasonable, and there's some really nice stuff there. (I saw an artist's diary I nearly bought, with six copies thereof, for each of you.) Not to mention the Burts Bees store, and the computer store, and the clothing store, and the book store, and ohmigod.   Not to mention the incredible cafe that's in the Olin library. . .   Yeah, I like it here. *grins*   Had critique of my paper as well. A lot of compliments on the stylistic aspects, a lot of criticism of the organization. To be fair, the criticism is well deserved. But I have quite a bit of work to do on that, and the letters of direction to read, from Abelard and Heloise, before we get to discussing them tomorrow. Thank god for that five hour nap.  Right now I'm going to get back to work on my paper.  Love to you all!

      So, all told, I didn't get to bed until two last night. You wouldn't believe how tired I am right now.   I'm actually writing this at midday because the other seminar has a huge crew of papers and things to write, and I don't want to take up the computer tonight, when most of them will be writing. (Fortunately, our other two computers are back! We now have five working computers in the house, and a few hundred around us on campus. Yay!)  Seminar today was incredibly enjoyable- my entire opinion of the case at hand changed completely, as we looked more at Heloise's writings. She writes with a very fine rhetoric of her own- at first, I was content to think her the innocent, enamored woman cast aside by the man she loved, but looking more closely at even her most impassionated statements, it's clear she's writing consciously, using techniques and rhetoric with calculation. It completely changed the way I perceive her character- and I respect her the more for it. I'm also warming -albeit slowly- to Abelard. I want to believe, though whether anyone can substantiate it through his writings is beyond me, that he's not necessarily cold or unfeeling, just so steeped in his dialectic that he communicates automatically and even formulaically in it- it's a coded message and he thinks in code.  That said, he must be aware of how detatched he seems, and yet chooses to communicate thusly anyway- so he's choosing to give an impression of emotional uninvolvement. Then again, he could hardly admit to emotional involvement because to do so would undermine Heloise's mental security, and his conviction that his castration had, in fact, been to some higher purpose. After all, you can hardly argue dissatisfaction with your physical predicament when you're simultaneously trying to pretend that you're blessed and pleased to be the recipient of so great a mercy from God.  But anyway. . .   Besides that, I've had lunch so far. . . tomato soup, foccacia to DIE for, grapes, tuna salad, and three-cheese macaroni. I'm going to weight another eighty pounds when I come back from this thing.   The presentation by Gannet health center over sex and healthy relationships is at three this afternoon. Apparently there were some issues with relationships beginning and pregnancy at last year's Texas TASP, and consequently they're taking a more proactive approach this time. We're already not supposed to form relationships of an exclusive nature anyway- this just adds to that restriction.   I'm actually going to go take a nap now. . . *sleeeeepy*  Love and cuddles to all of you.   Jen

      Wow. Tired. Really, really, inexplicably  tired , all the time. It's very frustrating.   Anyway, today was the first day of lectures. I really enjoyed the discussion, though it got frustratingly nitpicky at times, down to arguments over the interpretation of single words. With so many varying -and, to be fair, intelligent- opinions of the text, the real challenge was getting a chance to speak, not staying awake.   After lectures, lunch, then we took a tour of the campus and were issued IDs and campus internet accounts. Don't use mine- keep the webmail address as your primary email point. I don't want to even think about the kind of mess that will evolve from trying to keep the two straight.   Then I came home, took a nap- I'm already in love with this building, though I'm still getting used to my bunk bed (Jen's in the top bunk: it's a recipe for disaster, non?)- and we had a pubspeak this evening. Andrew, Factora for Telluride II, presented on Architecture and the challenge of Monuments. Minyang, our Factora, presented on the Cultural Revolution in China. You wouldn't believe how much more interesting both subjects are presented by people who are involved -and how much easier to understand!   We also had the kitchen tour today. Fortunately, I don't have dish duty until Friday, so I have all week to forget how to work the blasted machinery. *eyeroll* However, as compensation, we have a freezer full of pizza and icecream which I could go break into now if I really wanted some. It's ridiculous the kind of freedom we have. I'm going to get spoiled and never be able to adjust to school life again.   Anyway, we also had our first writing assignment given today, and with a bare two hours for use of the computer lab, and only two computers with sixteen kids to write essays, things have been cramped.   The following is the quote on which I had to write:  "But if I have distressed you by mentioning the dangers which beset me or the death I fear, it was done in accordance with your own request, or rather, entreaty. For the first letter you wrote me has a passage which says, "And so in the name of Christ, who is still giving you some protection for this service, we beseech you to write as often as you think fit to us who are his handmaids and yours, with news of the perils in which you are still storm-tossed.  We are all that are left you, so at least you should let us share your sorrow or your joy.  It is always some consolation in sorrow to feel that it is shared, and any burden laid on several is carried more lightly or removed." Why then do you accuse me of making you share my anxiety when I was forced to do so at your own behsest? When I am suffering in despair of my life, would it be fitting for you to be joyous? Would you want to be partners only in joy, not grief, to join in rejoicing without weeping with those who weep? There is no wider distinction between true friends and false than the fact that the former share adversity, the later only prosperity.   Say no more, I beg you, and cease from complaints like these which are so far removed from teh true depths of love." (p.142-43)  It's an excerpt from a letter by Abelard to Heloise, quoting one of her own letters back to her, from the period following his authorship of the  Historia Calamitatum  which retold the story of his rise to fame, seduction of Heloise, and subsequent entry into the ecclesiatical life. Heloise got her hands on it, and ten years after their separation, used it as a pretext to write him again, to confess to him the love and passion she'd never managed to be quit of. It's a beautiful story, and I recommend you all read the book, if for nothing else than to follow along with what I"m doing, since I can't give you lot MY homework.   Anyway, we were asked to look for evidence of Abelard's rhetoric and views and beliefs in the excerpt we chose. Here's my essay. Well, draft one. It gets sent to be made into soup tomorrow.   Jennifer Green  Cornell TASP I  Assignment I  June 28, 2004                  A Burden Shared: Abelard’s Rhetoric and Views in Reproach to Heloise  	The passage echoes Abelard’s changed conception of the ties between himself and his erstwhile  lover, and plays upon Heloise’s expressed compassion for his condition, but Abelard’s rhetorical questions, accusative verbs, and axiomatic, even impersonal conclusion only serve to emphasize the tension in their relationship, the dichotomy between their expectations for one another. The author pays lip service to an expectation which he holds for himself and Heloise; he employs the requisite rhetorical devices to win his point. And yet his language and tone suggest an antagonistic attitude of which the writer may not recognize, even in his own work, creating an interesting subtext beneath the apparently orthodox sentiments expressed.    	The forceful language of Abelard’s opening statement and in the rhetorical questions which follow his citation of Heloise’s letter suggest a hidden antagonism in the monk’s words to his onetime-bride. Though allowances must be made for translation, the repetition of aggressive nouns, the use of “request”, “entreaty”, “accuse”, “making”, “forced”, and “behest” in conjunction with Heloise’s actions, suggest an interesting dynamic between the two: here it is Heloise taking charge, making demands, while Abelard concedes to her point. But the verbs used have less than complimentary connotations: they are words of complaint, of querulousness, the words used by a man unwillingly complying, unwillingly submitting. Their use flavors the overall tone of the passage, suggesting that Abelard is irritated with her reaction, her highly personal entreaty, or is perhaps frustrated with her abrupt switch from a reasoned, if impassioned request for news, to an emotional and inconclusive, inarticulate concern. Abelard’s words –and the attitude reflected therein- are evocative of his oft-expressed frustration with Heloise’s fixation and nostalgia for their passion, and of his frequent his exhortations to her to turn her attentions to their God, rather than dwell on their lost love.   	Common to Abelard’s rhetorical style is his use of the three rhetorical questions which follow his citation, challenging Heloise on the dichotomy between her earlier pleas for news and her emotional refutation of his state.  The repetition of the question, “Why. . . When. . . Would. . . ?” (p.142) is rhetorical as well, and echoes the later parallel structure and grammatical repetition of his closing.  But the questions, as much as their format, are telling, indicative both of Abelard’s concerns and of his attitude toward his former mistress and wife. Here a closer inspection of the original text would be beneficial, as the translation’s use of the word “fitting” is ambiguous in English, carrying a connotation of public respectability and propriety before the eye of the world.  If indeed the connotation of the word is borne out by the original text, it is only one more small allusion to Abelard’s evident concern with worldly reputation.  More significant, perhaps, to his relationship with Heloise, are the expectations implied in the tenor of the questions: “Would you want to be partners only in joy, not in grief . . .?  There is no wider distinction between true friends. . .” (p.142). The monk speaks of “partners”, of “true friends”- but not of lovers, not of loving, or even specifically of the bond of marriage.  He is subtly stating the grounds on which their relationship will stand- the position from which he is willing to receive her letters.  By neatly sidestepping the personal, emotional implications of her appeal, presented, though they are, through the channel of her responsibilities to her nuns, and focusing instead on the platonic, intellectual aspects of their relationship, he subtly indicates the behavior he anticipates of her, in regards to their erstwhile love.  It is clear, however, that while he expects the passion of her attitude toward him to be redirected into intellectual and ecclesiastical channels, he also expects her devotion and dedication to him to remain unchanged. He does not seem to question that in the face of his manipulation of their relationship, Heloise will capitulate and accept the new path which he has indicated, and his unconcern betrays his assurance of her devotion.  	 The conclusion of Abelard’s argument is noteworthy for its synthesis of the man’s views with pure rhetorical device: “There is no wider distinction between true friends and false than the fact that the former share adversity the later only prosperity” (p.143). The repetition of grammatical structure in the “former share adversity the later only prosperity” and the parallelism in “true friends” in “adversity” and “false” in “prosperity” are both rhetorical techniques and make the closing aphoristic in the extreme, almost a truism. Although the statement is in no way judgmental or moralizing, it is unapologetically impersonal, a philosophical statement rather than a personal closing to an emotionally charged series of queries- and in its detachment, it is as much a rebuff as the most blunt rebuke. Yet, the maxim, however detached from the debate of Heloise’s requests and Abelard’s suffering it may seem, reveals still more of the man: an understanding of the varying tenors of friendship, its potential profundity and, equally, its possible inanity.  For a man so celebrated, and also so often condemned, the distinction between a real companion and a sycophant must have been incredibly important, and Abelard’s words on true and fair-weather friends suggests a great deal about his morality, including that he judges the quality of friendship on the basis suggesting that he judges his friends on loyalty, particularly in the face of persecution and suffering.    Ultimately, Abelard’s carefully crafted phrases, his rhetorical devices and careful wordcraft serve both to underline those points which he wishes to make prominent, and to justify and conceal, perhaps even to and from himself, an evident antagonism.

      I'm here in Cornell. Sitting in the Library of Telluride House, actually.  *beams* It's a bloody mansion- I wish you guys could see this place! Four stories of brick and dormitory goodness.   Met my roomate, Yiwen, today. She's incredibly nice- and talking to her can be a bit like talking to myself. It's so nice to share a room with somebody who understands I need quiet when I'm there, and doesn't mind just enjoying the space and the silence. She's Malaysian, with a slight accent and a pretty smile. Our suite-mates are Jenna (yup, another one!) and Hannah. Hannah's a tecky, and a huge Oscar Wilde fan; Jenna's from the Yosemite area, and we sat and compared impressions of the park for an hour. The entire crew is intelligent, eloquent, and interesting.   First TASP meeting tonight, as well- we dithered over Pubspeak times (I need to get to work on that. . . *flush*) Ended up choosing Mondays and Wednesdays, which means I'll be going on the third week of the trip, on Wednesday: pray for me. I haven't decided whether I'll be presenting on Archaeology or on a comparision of Renaissance political reality with Nicolo Machievelli's theories, but I know I've got to decide soon.  It'll probably be the former- I'm much more conversant with the conventions thereof, and I can give demonstrations and such, which is much more interesting than just a lecture.   Besides Pubspeaks, we also chose committees. I'm on the "Self-meals" committee and the "Outings" committee. A trip to New York is in the works -please god, I want to see a musical- but whatever works.  We go to Farenheit: 9/11 this week, on Thursday. Tomorrow's the first set of Pubspeaks (by the factora, fortunately) plus kitchen orientation (we do, indeed, have chores) and the first day of seminar.   Tuesday? *grins* We get a sex education talk by Genet, the health center here on campus. I can't wait. *eyeroll*   Wednesday, another set of Pubspeaks, Thursday Farenheit: 9/11, Friday our curfew goes to one o'clock- SEE, DAD! I'M GOING TO BE UNGOVERNABLE WHEN I GET BACK!!!!!!- and Saturday we have house cleanup. *smirks*  This is going to rock some socks. I can't wait.   Kisses to all of you reading this, keeping up with my trials and travails in Ithaca.   I miss you all, and I wish you were here.

      So!    Take-Off Day, minus one.  I'm revved. Revved and a bit nervous. I'm finishing my reading of  Abelard and Heloise  tonight- och, I never did get around to giving the reading list. Here we go. (Good luck finding any of these. Lawrence people, just so you know, the public library has, maybe, two of these volumes. And they're listed as missing/long overdue. *eyeroll*)  Letters of Abelard and Heloise Lais (Marie de France) Decameron (Boccaccio) Heptameron (Marguerite de Navarre) poetry by Veronica Franco.  This is my idea of paradise, I know that, but I'd feel better if I could pack Lawrence up with me and take it along. I know I'll make friends -perhaps it's arrogant of me, but I really have no worries on the social score. At the very least, I can get along with everyone who's introduced themselves: several of these people look like excellent potential friends. And it will be a relief to do something intellectual with my summer, rather than waste it.   But still- missing out on Guard, missing out on all of my family and friends and the things I wanted to do with my summer- that's unbelievably, unbelievably hard.   Och, no point in whining and cringing about it. I need to make some progress on my Pubspeak, and I need to get some sleep.  Tonight it begins.   I'm ready.  Love to you all. Oh, and my next post?  From Cornell. *grins*

      Mmmn, so, Jen has had a lovely day. I'm a little short on sleep -I'll try to make that up this afternoon, or if not then, with an early night tonight, but despite that I feel wonderful.  Just finished watching  Amelie . If you haven't seen it, do so. Do so now. It's beautiful and simple, and reminded me of how connected I am, even to those I barely know, whose lives I only brush by in passing, and never see, nor intend to touch.  Fragments of good and bad.  I don't really even know how to describe it, but it made me happy, on the most profound level possible.  The other thing that makes me happy is that, despite all my resolutions to hold on to my cash a bit longer, I finally gave in to the siren call of the Ithaca Farmer's Market and went back.  They had a quintet of muscians on fiddles and some ethic guitars, who did a wonderful rendition of an "old English folk song". . .  *hums along*  Sweet dreams are made of these/And who am I to disagree/Travel the world and the seven seas. . .   Okay, so perhaps not so old, or so English, or so folk, but it was funny as all hell.  Beyond that, I wandered the shop and the pier, sat by the lake and watched the ducks, ate about a quarter of a baguette. I'm attempting to go vegetarian, and it's working fairly well (surprise, I actually don't have to cut that much out of my diet) but it will be interesting to try to keep it up when I go home.  The decision is made all the more problematic by the fact that I *hate* tofu, with a passion. It's like vegetarian SPAM, except worse.  But anyway, back to the other thing that made me happy. This isn't the best picture of it, but it gives you at least an idea. . . Four weeks ago, when I went to the market for the first time, I wandered into this photographer's stall and did a doubletake. For a second I thought she'd taken a picture of a fairy, and all the wires in my brain sort of crossed. Then I bent down and got closer. It wasn't a fairy- it was the first seeds of milkweed blowing away in front of roses. Ivory and amber and rose- flawlessly beautiful. That picture has haunted me for weeks. Just couldn't stop thinking about it. So I finally caved and bought a *much* smaller version of the original print.  Set me back thirty bucks, but I'll happily take a cut out of my first grade report just to have it.  Anyway, here's the link to the photographer's site, where you can see a very *bad* representation of the photo. Most of the others look all right, but this one just doesn't do justice to the colors.  Enjoie!   urlLink http://www.pollyjoanphoto.com/large/fall_b4.html

      Yup. Time for "the" paper of the program. It's supposed to be the best of my writing this six weeks.&nbsp; It'll be nice to write something decent again; my most recent efforts have been trash-worthy.   So, what've I chosen for my topic? *grins* Marie de France's&nbsp; Lais &nbsp;and the  tensons  of the women&nbsp; trobaritz , the female troubadours.   It's very interesting, actually. Our modern concept of the troubadour (or at least mine) has absolutely nothing to do with the reality of the most important poets. These were nobles, occasionally landless, but often wealthy and priviledged individuals with hereditary rule of local territories, who applied themselves to mapping out the boundaries of "courtly love" through poetic debates (tenzones) and  midoms , poems which glorified&nbsp;a particular lady, or the role of a lady in courtly love. &nbsp;  (mia dominius- feminine "my", masculine "lord")   There were numerous schools of these troubadours- Italian, Provencal, Minnesanger, Trouveres (Seekers), a Gallican-Portugese school, Catalan and even a Mozarab School.&nbsp; And when I say school, I mean conventions and traditions within which the local troubadors&nbsp;wrote, not&nbsp;physical schools. . . (this confused me&nbsp;initially).&nbsp; But there are female poets *only* within the Provencal school (though geographically some wander close to other regions)- the Countess of Dia, whom I've&nbsp;cited&nbsp;at Maison d'Etre, and whose work I fully plan to work into Marie's character, for our&nbsp;Dark Ages&nbsp;game, is one of my favorites. (Her poetry is *beautiful* I don't even understand the Provencal, and I'm entranced. I just wish I could read the stuff.)&nbsp; There's another set of poems, a fiery debate between lovers gone awry- the&nbsp;man tells the lady that he wrote poems to her only for monetary gain- she orders him off to his monastary- he tells her he'd rather go to his lover, but that she belongs in the monastary, given how her beauty is set to fade- not quite as good as Maffio Venier telling Veronica Franco that he'd rather cut off his balls and make omelets with them than&nbsp;pay&nbsp;the price for her services, but&nbsp;close.   They cover a whole variety of&nbsp; topics,&nbsp;from questions of courtly propriety (how much&nbsp;regard should a woman show her serviteur, when he is of lower rank?) to protestations of love or hate or some combination of the two.&nbsp; All of it, of course, is&nbsp;calculated for public consumption, but I refuse to accept the&nbsp;idea that the troubadors writing&nbsp;back and forth to&nbsp;one another were not, on some levels, and at some times, sincere.&nbsp;   And there's the question, too, of language. . . what I'm calling Provencal here, is actually la&nbsp;langue d'oc, as&nbsp;opposed to&nbsp;la langue d'oil (oui) of the&nbsp;North.&nbsp;&nbsp;Langue d'oc (Languedoc, now, a French&nbsp;province) was the common tongue of all of southern France and a good portion of the Pyrannes, and&nbsp;is the language&nbsp;of these female poets. Yet I can't help but&nbsp;wonder, if there aren't manuscripts in the other languages, the other variations, that are the work of women. . .  Mmmn.&nbsp; And then there's the hermaphoriditic language throughout the convention. . . as I&nbsp;noted earlier , &nbsp; midoms  are created from mia dominius - the feminine pronoun combined with a masculine noun. (Though how they know it's not mia dominia, I don't know.)&nbsp; And the contrast between  dompna &nbsp;(the lady and leader of the convention) and the  drutz, &nbsp; her servitor/knight/lover. (Looks a bit like drudge, non?)  And of course, there are the echoes of social tension: historians seem to think that as a result of the Crusades, which stripped much of Provence and France of their male peerage, a great deal of social tension sprung up between the wives of the peers, who were now ruling, and the men who remained and had to serve their lady's authority. (I'd argue that the Courtly Love tradition arose precisely to pander to these women's authority and to support their positions as political and social arbiters, since as the crusades stretched on, and their husbands were absent longer and longer, they&nbsp;were less obviously connected to the "real"&nbsp;authority&nbsp;in the lands, as represented by their husbands.)  More later-&nbsp;lunch now!&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Today's been an "all-sorts-of-things" day.  Good and bad.   Good: I got Myre's cookies (they're in a box by my feet; I need to find something sharp so I can open them); I got a nap (five hours! Sleeping rocks my world!); There are ice-pops and diet coke, the two most important food groups! ; I got to look through the werewolf book more.   Is it TRUE that it's only a botch if you roll *no* successes and any quantity of ones? Because if that's the case, I've not been botching *nearly* as much as I thought. Apparently if I get even one success, that negates a botch, and I only fail?  I'm quoting the book; this doesn't sound like the way we do it.   So, anyway, it was also good because I learned something about rules I didn't know.   The Bad: I figured out why I don't feel like I belong here: someone ducked their head into the room and asked Yi-wen if she wanted to go for a walk up to Collegetown and get dinner, since dinner wasn't looking as though it would be too hot. She said she would, but fell asleep. Me, I'm sitting there listening to this, and it occurs to me that *nobody* seeks me out to do things.   Owie. That stung some.   I guess in some ways, though, I'd already understood that, while I'm welcome here, I'm not sought out or much beloved. I do have my close friends, don't get me wrong- Ashley and Hannah (hug buddy!) and I get along well with David and Jim, though I wouldn't call them close friends. But I'm not popular or part of a clique. There are people I'd like to be friends with, specifically Robin and Tess, but I don't feel like they want me around- their little group of three (it includes Jordan) is very insular, and I hate intruding.   Some part of me goes, "Jen, you're an ass, if you just asked if you could come along they'd let you, and maybe they -and you- would even enjoy it," but I guess I'm stubborn enough to insist that someone ask me, thereby indicating that they *want* me along, rather than ask for myself, even if I'm welcome.   All that said, I get along here. I don't want this to sound all bad.  I've never quite understood how I could live without super close friends in my proximity- I know now. And to be honest, it's not all bad. I am emotionally autonomous here, in a way I'd never be at home. I care what people think of me, yes, I want to be liked, and I'll be sorry to leave- but it won't break my heart. I'm at least, I think, respected. Sophia told me I was like everybody's mom, and I guess that's another reason I'm not sought out- momma, kisses to you, but I usually don't take you with me out to dinner or with friends, ayah?   I think I'd normally be a lot more ripped up about being unpopular here, but I'm actually sort of used to this position.  It's the same one I've filled for years, in school and out- this kind of lame duck, welcome-but-not-sought-out niche: I'm convenient for discussion, friendly to almost everybody, intelligent and respected, but I'm not anyone whose company folk go out of the way to obtain. (I'll give you my little rant on why this proves I have a bland personality some other time.) It's only in small groups of people, those I'm closest to and share the most interests with, that I'm really involved emotionally, that I have things to say and might even be an interesting conversationalist. MIGHT.   You know what, though? I'm okay on the fringes. In a way, this is really good for me. Like I said- I was worried about how I'd fare uprooted and far from home.  I've done a lot to stay in contact with home, because that's where my real life is.  This place has changed me, I guess, shoved tons of new ideas and experiences into my brain -goddess knows I'll never write again without feeling guilt for every word I put to the page- and I'm glad I'm here, I'm glad for the experience. Or, if not necessarily glad, then I know I needed it.    Well, no, I didn't even need it. It's incredibly hard to explain.   I've had fun, yes, but not always. I've worked hard, but not always. I've been part of a group, but not always.  And all the little pieces and experiences and "not always"-es have cobbled together to form a larger whole, my experience here. Subconsciously, I'm not even aware of some of the things I've learned; understanding of the politics of this house will come when I go home and pull these memories out, after a few years. Since I hope someday to be a Factotum or professor here, knowledge of those politics will come in handy.    I've been invited -urged- to apply to Cornell, and the Telluride House. I have to admit, it's a huge incentive.  Food, room, and board paid, plus a ten thousand a year stipend. . . I like the idea.  But I still want to be at Washington more. . .  I still hate KU. . . *ducks tomatos from Jacob and Mrs. Johnson*  Anyway, kiddos, my long and rambling entry is done. I'm going to go read my Veronica Franco (Oh, god, I love her poetry. . . Venetian courtesan, at one time a leader of the  cortigana  and of intellectal society. . . would that I were her, in another life. . . You'll get my VF rant later, I promise) and do my homework.  Bisou!

      Yay! TASP dance party! Funfunfunfunfun. *shimmies her hips and flips her hair*   I usually am not big on dancing, but there was a small enough group that I felt okay doing it.&nbsp; (And it was friendly and chaotic enough that I didn't feel like the fat girl trying to boogie at the edge of the floor.&nbsp; I mean, I was, but I didn't feel that way.) All kinds of music (lot of spanish stuff, lot of rap/grinding/DJ mixes) and laughing.&nbsp; Hannah, one of my suite mates, turned out to be the most risque dancer. I believe at one point she got up on the couch over Paul and began hip thrusting at eye level- not that he seemed to mind.   Well, so much for that "monastic" business. *wry grin*  But the party's over and it was fun.   What else did Jen do. . . Ah! Jen wrote. I did a lot -LOT- of work on Mara. She's turning out to be a superb character, and I'm looking forward to running her in Justin's game.&nbsp; Bone Gnawer Ahroun.&nbsp; Six feet of chip-on-her-shoulder, hard-assed, domineering, opinionated academia. With a soft spot for family, home, and hearth- when she can bring herself to give up some of her so-precious independence.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Can't wait to kick some bootay with her.   On Ely's character journal, it's on hiatus (if you hadn't guessed) There's a three-part series coming up, but I need time without writing assignments to work on it. I'm trying, but it's impossible to concentrate on it seriously while I'm here.&nbsp; It will get done, though.   And off I go!  Jen

      *thunk*  *buries her face in the squooshy leather couch out in the forum*  So, Jen pulled yet *another* all-nighter trying to get the story she wanted to do in a format that  somewhat  approached her desires.&nbsp;   I know -I  know - I am capable of producing emotionally effective prose, of handling the topic I've (finally) chosen with grace.&nbsp;   But goddamn it, at five this morning, that just *wasn't* happening.   Why five in the morning? Mmn, well, let's see.   Yesterday after getting out of seminar, I had approximately two hours before the mandatory volleyball court cleanup. We pulled a few tons of weeds out of the court (incidentally, it's a very nice court, a combination of clay and sand, but it needs far more maintenance than one group of rowdy teens can provide).&nbsp; The court cleanup ended at about four; I stayed out with most of the rest of the group to play some volleyball. Our team dominated (20-10, thank you very much, and I served eight of those points) and the game ended about four. Lots and lots and lots of fun.   Thereafter, of course, I had to go upstairs and peel out of my incredibly messy clothes, and shower to remove copious amounts of dirt from my hair.   I can't really account for the next couple of hours. We had dinner ( I  thought it was good: I wish people here would stop complaining about the food. It could be worse. We could have hamburger helper for dinner every night, the way I do at-   never mind. *angelic grin*)  Anyway, so besides eating, Jen did copious amounts of napping, as well (I'm thinking about&nbsp; stealing one of the couches from the forum when I leave. I'll give up all my clothes, all my bedding, everything. All I want from life is that couch. . .)&nbsp; and bestirred myself about eight to go try to work on my story.&nbsp; I finally hit on a concept (which I'll relate later) but didn't have time to develop it; at nine we dashed out the door and hiked down to the Ithaca Commons (it's a bit like Lawrence's downtown), to see Farenheit 9/11.  On that subject-  I wish, in a way, that I'd gone to see it on my own.&nbsp; I have a tendency to echo others' opinions&nbsp;of art when I'm not sure about my own views, but I think that after twenty four hours, I've pretty much settled my opinion- which agrees on many points with the views expressed by the rest of TASP.   9/11 is *not* a movie that will change  anybody's  views. If anything, it only polarizes the two sides more.&nbsp; That's not particularly surprising, or necessarily a bad thing. (Though I think it only makes any kind of political progress even *more* unlikely -which is also not necessarily&nbsp;a bad thing.) But what bothered me about the movie, what continues to bother me about it, even a day later, is the manipulation inherent in Moore's approach to his subjects.&nbsp; I understand the value of seeking out a family whose child was killed in Iraq, to have them speak on their feelings, on their experiences.&nbsp; But Moore overplays it.&nbsp; Regardless of whether the family feels Bush is responsible, having them read a letter in which their son denounces Bush, from his post in Iraq- forcing them to relive that, and then using their grief to put&nbsp;Moore himself in the inassailable position of "defender of the griefstricken and member of the moral right" gets my hackles up.&nbsp;  There&nbsp;are other issues in the movie I didn't like. Moore is a good investigative reporter, but he overestimates the importance of his&nbsp;own&nbsp;discoveries. His neat connect the dots, at the beginning of the movie, portrays Bush as part&nbsp;of a huge&nbsp;fiscal and political conspiracy dedicated to devouring the oil reserves of the middle&nbsp;east,&nbsp;and while I think that's almost certainly Bush's goal, Moore overplays these connections, too.&nbsp; Perhaps I'm just a political cynic, but it doesn't surprise me at all that Bush's cronies and financial partners are deeply woven into the fabric of his war effort.&nbsp; To be honest, wealth and family connections are *necessary* in politics. I'm almost glad Bush has them: they undoubtably oil&nbsp;America's already&nbsp;rusty political machinery.  Don't get me wrong, I don't admire that kind of political manuevering on a moral level. But it's necessary, and on that basis, I consider it something desirable in a leader. There is a place for scruples, and that's *not* politics. And Moore's sanctimonious, pedantic attitude about his revelations makes me wonder if he thinks the Democratic party any better- I rather doubt it.  So the movie ended (the popcorn, at least, was really good) and I got back, and got to work.&nbsp; But as exhausted as I've been, I didn't get anything productive accomplished- I know my idea is so good, but goddamn, couldn't write *anything* worthwhile to go with it.   Well, I've got time, now.&nbsp; And I'm going to go get some sleep.&nbsp;   Talk at y'all later!  Jen

      So, we began our presentations of our stories today.  Jordan went: his prose is exquisite, his characters graven in glass -clear and precise.  Alex went- her ten-canto poem was a flood for the senses. She has an exquisite command of language, a way with diction that I envy.  Matt's rap contest between Dioneo and Parlamente was agonizingly funny: Josh adapted another Heptameron story for the stage, and us all silent, waiting for the final blow to fall.  And me?   I sat there very quietly in my corner and kept my eyes down, trying -and failing- not to feel miserably outclassed. I am a decent writer, but I'm not fit company for these. Give me space and I can wind you up in a story, if I can choose the subject and twist it as I wish. But here I don't have those choices: here I cannot even muster a worthwhile attempt.  And what makes it worse is that, unlike my peers, I'm not so profound a writer that I can say something worth reading again.   Meh. I'm going to go upstairs with my can of coke, curl up around my laptop, and try to knit up some raveled sleeves of care- or at least make a narrative worth mentioning in class tomorrow. (I'd stay mum, but I don't have a choice.)  I remember last night that Rociel complimented me on my character journal. Why is it that I can't see this assignment as I see each week of vampire- a challenge to be relished and met? I'm twisting the truth as much in that journal as I would here, with these tales. But every time I try to twist, I run into the bounds of my subject matter, of my assignment, and the brick wall of my own insufficiency.   Meh, I'm getting to work before I have to pull another all-nighter .

      Mreh. So I was angsty and irritated and wrote a couple searing denunciations earlier. I'm feeling a little better now. (*took a nap*) Still sore and cramped and ache-y, (not to mention bitchy- *rueful grin*) but I've consoled myself with sleep and a frozen Snickers bar, and I'm all set. I hope.  Good news is that we've moved on to the Lais of Marie de France. I read them ahead of time, so I'm already familiar with at least the basic plot structures and tales. They're some of my favorite narratives, though they lack the imagery of fairytales, and the passion of the Decameron and Heptameron.  They make up for both points, however, with really beautiful language, and stories that seem almost fragile. Like fine china, written on a page.   That's about as flighty as my language is going to get today. I'm dog tired, depressed, and more than a bit harried.   Still, I guess, I have to laugh. The water main broke today, and I've been out of sorts about it all day (I mean, come on! No toilets, no showers, no teeth brushing, *nothing*)but it's funny in its way.  More importantly: I *know* the portapotties stationed out on the lawn are funny. Again, in a horribly twisted kind of way.  Rather reminiscent of modern art, as a matter of fact. . .  God, I won't say that to Alex, she'll kill me. *Grins*      Now that I'm in a better mood. . . I'm about to go up to the store and get my photos.  We'll see how those turn out. If anything's exemplary, I'll make sure I get it online and then host it on my geocities webpage so you guys can see. I'm also happy, because I'm going with Robin, who's basically the epitome of what I want to be when I grow up. Nice, quiet, refined, intelligent, considerate. . .   Eh, I have a lot of work to do before I get to be Robin. (Not to mention she's incredibly pretty. That reminds me. I'm taking pictures of everyone who's here and posting 'em, so you guys can see how incredibly pretty everybody is. It's sickening. There's not a truly ugly person in the lot.  Particularly the girls. *Jen feels like a gosling*)   Well, that's enough out of me. Time for the hike up the hill to the store, so I can use a toliet that's not plastic and sticky (the portapotties are not what we'd call appetizing, so after a glance, I've been avoiding them all day. Again, the parallels to modern art are unmistakable. *cough*.) and get my piccies.   More postage later.   Bisous, y'all!  Jen

      Mmmn, so I get to spend tomorrow tacked into a dress and heels, conversing politely with strangers and being put on display like an animal in a zoo. &nbsp; I'm not exactly thrilled with such a waste of a perfectly good Saturday, but hell, I signed on, and if I have to do the pretty, I have to.  &nbsp; I'm thinking I'll be wearing the strap-less blue denim tango dress, with my nice stilletto black heels and the jeweled collar I have.&nbsp; Josh, you may be the only one,&nbsp;excepting&nbsp;my family, who's ever seen me in any of the above.&nbsp;The real pain is going to be getting my hair up, in the appropriate number of braids and twists and whatnot. I'll try to get pictures so at least it won't have been a complete waste.  &nbsp; For now, though, I'm bushed, and have been all day. I'm going to go crash in bed.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Kisses, kiddos. I miss you all.  &nbsp; Jen &nbsp; &nbsp;

      So, despite the fact that our seminar is nomially about Gender Roles in the Renaissance, we spent the vast majority of today discussing writing, and writer's responsibility. Some interesting ideas posited, which I'm going to post here, just so that y'all can form your own opinions.  &nbsp;  In many ways, elitist or highly intellectual writing is a code.&nbsp; Often that code is specious- its phrases have become so overused, so trite, that they lack any meaning at all.&nbsp;Other times they develop connotations&nbsp;which alter their original meaning. (Case in point:&nbsp;I perceive Feminism as militant,&nbsp;and feminist sentiments which do not take an inflexible or over-zealous stance I often don't even notice- where the former causes me to ignore passages of a text, the later is subtle enough that I entertain the author's arguments without intially noticing the underlying resonances.) &nbsp;  &nbsp;  So what happens if one spends time sorting out which phrases have lost meaning, and which have changed, and then wrote a paper utilizing those phrases as&nbsp;a kind of code? I can see two advantages right away: first, you avoid trite "catchphrases" (to use a catch phrase!) and so,&nbsp;individuals who'd otherwise gloss over the familiar word or sentence, assuming they understood your point on the basis of their preconceptions, must&nbsp;instead pay greater attention to your argument.&nbsp;Second, you develop an inside joke, an elitism of your own, whereby you could convey your own opinions of an idea simply through your diction- not just through charged words, but through words which you have catagorized as meaningful or meaningless.  &nbsp;  And if one knew words which automatically deflected the attention of readers, wouldn't it be easy to undermine the arguments of others, to reinterpret or present them in such a way that no one would regard them?  &nbsp;  And is doing so even  ethical ? Do we, as writers, have a duty to present the most honest accounting, or if we are trying to be persuasive, do we have the right to skew our language in such a way as to make our opponents unapproachable or uninteresting. (As versus reinterpreting so that they appear more extreme, or their opinions become unpalatable, which are common techniques in editorials and journalism.)  &nbsp;  Although, I'm reminded that oftentimes, presenting the counter-arguments against one's own view gives readers a ready response when, having been convinced of your beliefs, they have to defend their new opinons to others.&nbsp; And obfuscating counter arguments (as I'm doing here) hardly helps your position.  &nbsp;  An interesting problem, at least to me.  &nbsp;  Minyang, our Factora, also brought up an interesting point: the question of reader and writer responsibility.&nbsp; When you write inflated prose, using complex sentences or bombastic language, your readers are tempted to blow you off.&nbsp; Why waste time deciphering your point when they could move on to more accessible portions of the text? Big, ideological words also allow a writer to place the onus of interpretation on the reader- rather than clearly expressing what he or she really believes, and taking the flak that comes as a result of her opinon, the scribe can simply couch her meaning vaguely, and thereby please everybody, since each individual will interpret the writer's message in the way most pleasing to them.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So overly complex sentences become literary orphans- no one wants to take responsiblity for them, and I think that's a tragedy! Language deserves to be loved, but even I can't love some of the nonsense I've seen in print.&nbsp; The individual words, yes, the idea expressed, yes, but the&nbsp;combination of the two?  &nbsp;  Not in the slightest.  &nbsp;  So writing becomes&nbsp;a question of phrasing your words so that the reader will follow them unconsciously, so that the reader can rephrase your points.&nbsp; Because by re-reading, by being able to describe your argument, the reader in some ways supports your points, without even thinking about it.&nbsp; Even if they don't agree, they at least understand- a step up from blind incomprehension.  &nbsp;  Needless to say, all of this has had a dramatic effect on my own view of writing, particularly as one who has the grandiose notion of writing a fantasy novel. (And the pretension to believe she can actually be original in doing so!)  &nbsp;  Fantasy writing is all about inducing the reader to suspend belief. You can do that through certain stock phrases,&nbsp; "Once upon a time," "the most beautiful woman in the world", "happily ever after", or you can do it through presenting compelling portraits of characters, or a fascinating plot, or physical details which ground the reader in your setting.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Or, I'm now realizing it, you can do it by using such simple, direct language, that the reader forgets to look for calculation, that they accept the responsibility for interpreting your words without thinking about it.  &nbsp;  This has relevance on two points.&nbsp; First, I have always been aware that in writing  Silvereyes , I was failing on some level to do Altair's character justice. Her predicament is a painfully complex one, that of a woman who longs to be part of accepted society, but who is by birth and nature the only connection between that accepted society and a society of deviants (the Unhallowed).&nbsp; Her situation is futher complicated by the fact that she feels obliged against her will, and by deviation in herself, to represent the unwelcome element.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I&nbsp;intend to start off, presenting the Unhallowed as the ultimate evil.&nbsp;But I know, and my readers will learn, that they are not evil.&nbsp; The Unhallowed&nbsp;were people once, too: they still yearn to&nbsp; be&nbsp; people. It&nbsp;is the reason,&nbsp;ironically, that they are so savage, so inhumane: men want to destroy them because they are inconvenient, because they are frightening, because they have needs -a hunger- which cannot be assuaged without loss to society, and the Unhallowed feel they are fighting their own destruction, that they have every right to use whatever means come to hand.&nbsp;More, humanity has stripped the deviants' bodies and their cities, desecrated their graves, and&nbsp;is now encroaching upon their final&nbsp;citadels- the Unhallowed have a right to vengeance.&nbsp; In a way, these deviants are history personified, returning to&nbsp;wreak havoc on a culture which has turned its back on&nbsp;its own people, its own history, and works now to erase the memory of its failures.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sound familiar? It should.&nbsp; These ideas are some of what I've gleaned from Vampire.&nbsp; By having stood on the other side of the monster-versus-man conflict, I've lost my ability to catagorize one as good and the other as&nbsp;evil.&nbsp; I've come to realize how compelling inhumanity in humans, and&nbsp; humanity in&nbsp;the inhumane, can be.  &nbsp;  To relate this further to Vampire- the question of humanity is one that will trouble Elyssa in the coming months, I can tell you that.&nbsp; Already, Ely fears losing herself to the Beast. It's why she doesn't hunt, why she clings to firmly to convention and to posture, even before those&nbsp;she has no real reason to mislead. &nbsp;She is terrified of descending to the level of the monster. And while Robert's comment that humanity is as humanity does is of some comfort to her, Elyssa knows that there are certain things for which she will commit unspeakable acts, and is troubled by that knowledge.  &nbsp;  And her fears will only worsen when she embarks on the Path of Thorns- as her humanity becomes the latice on which the path grows, as her bones grow fragile with thorns, as she begins to lose control of the manifestations of the thorns- as she is eaten, from within, by her own creation.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Nor will her growing consciousness of Stephen and Eric's&nbsp;plans give her any comfort.&nbsp; Stephen's enmity, in particular, may prove fatal.&nbsp; And not only for her, but for the prince she has sworn to serve, and the clan that has given her wings.  &nbsp;  No easy time ahead for any of us,&nbsp;it seems. Not&nbsp;even Elyssa. &nbsp;

      Okay, so, the great Romance Novel Argument is at an end.&nbsp; Thank god, and not a moment too soon. &nbsp; I haven't talked about this much, for the last few days, but I've been enbroilled in an ongoing argument with Alex M.&nbsp; over the relative merits of romance novels, White Wolf roleplaying, my character journal for Elyssa, and other forms of non-Literary writing.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Her initial comment was something along the lines of "Why do you read that trash?" And the argument degenerated from there.&nbsp; Alex's viewpoint is that any piece of writing which is not higher literature -that is, which cannot be interpreted in a manifold of ways, lacks complex vocabulary, "Meaning", &nbsp;and advanced organizational structure, whether allegorical, descriptive, or otherwise- contributes to the overall decay of Literature as a whole- it is, as she told me tonight, anti-literature. She wonders why I spend so much time and effort on my character journal when I am not writing for&nbsp;a wider audience, why I'm wasting my talents as a writer on something so trivial as roleplaying.  &nbsp; She dislikes gaming as well, considering it a waste of time which could be better spent pursuing truth, learning new things, or using one's intellect.&nbsp;  &nbsp; You can all imagine my response, of course.&nbsp; I hate elitism, and much as I respect and like Alex, I can't stomach the attitude that *any* literature which is not Literature is automatically difficient and unworthy of consideration. That attitude devalues the English language, devalues language in general, and negates the effort that writers put into their work. It suggests that their can be no artistry in a story which is written without pretension- yet I know I have attempted artistic flourishes in my own writing, without having any illusions that my stories would someday touch the world.&nbsp; My own experience negates her arguments.  &nbsp; Why do I read romance novels? Because they're trashy, they're fun, they're sweet. They're a simple pleasure in a world that is so often full of complications and frustrations.&nbsp; Escapist? Certainly. But I see no shame in that.  &nbsp; In responses to her charges about the wastefulness of my writing for only my own pleasure, and about a subject which can be understood only by a small segment of the population, I have pointed out repeatedly that her intention to write for the&nbsp; literati  and the intellectual elite is much the same- writing for a small segment of the population, a select group which speaks with a certain vernacular and considers certain things "important", or worthy of preservation.&nbsp;   As for her judgement about my character journal- well, I realize the journal is incomplete, and heavily flawed, to boot. It needs work on a scale I cannot even describe. The number of scenes missing is ridiculous, and only free time and concerted effort can rectify that. But Alex argues not that my work is faulty, but that it is inherently lacking in merit and creativity because it is based on a universe and a plot developed by others.&nbsp; Because I did not have to exert myself to any great heights of creativity to write a story- I did not have to think for myself, only to follow type.  Of course, my reasons for my character journal are varied, and have little to do with attempting to perpetuate commercial writing or White Wolf.&nbsp; First, I enjoy the exercise, the challenge of writing for an audience that reads my work as it is written.&nbsp; I enjoy the complexity of taking events we all know and reinterpreting them through Elyssa's eyes.&nbsp; Her view of Ethan's death or the coup or Ziven's defection is independent of mine, and of the events in the game, and the challenge is to reconstruct the events in such a way that the final result remains true to her viewpoint and to the reality. Journalism, but backwards.  &nbsp; Then, too, there is the pleasure of writing for a group of individuals who, unless they are lying, in which case I will see to it that they suffer in the ninth circle of writer's hell, along with the plagarizers and "net-speakers", have been enjoying what I've written.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Furthermore, Elyssa is a character -her journal is a character journal. It is devoted to the very writerly concept of developing character -the practice of taking a cardboard stereotypical cut-out and giving it soul.&nbsp; It is a skill which writers must develop, and if I'm to ever write commercially, on any level, it is one I *must* possess.  &nbsp; And finally, there is the fact that in many ways, Elyssa is more real than I will ever be. I have devoted a degree of care and attention to her existence which is unprecedented among my characters, and if I have anything to say about it, her journal, in its finished form, will survive me by many years.&nbsp; Writing in it is a&nbsp;pleasure, a burden,&nbsp;a joy and a pain.&nbsp; And it is a point of pride.  &nbsp; Very&nbsp;much, in some ways, like a newspaper column, a novel, a poem, or any other "worthwhile" form&nbsp;of fiction.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Ultimately, my argument comes to this. I do not judge&nbsp;any work of literature on basis of its&nbsp;intended audience. My only consideration is the craft which goes into&nbsp;its creation, and the emotion which it evokes. This is why I believe in literature, in language. This is why, I believe, we communicate. To evoke&nbsp;emotion.&nbsp; &nbsp; If I ever, ever manage to make anyone cry with my writing,&nbsp; I will have&nbsp;accomplished something so noble that I will feel entirely justified, my entire existence answered, by those tears.&nbsp; Inflated? Hell yes. I, too, have my pretensions. But I try to live around them, to live on a level with other people, rather than on an exclusively intellectual, exclusively elite peak. I *have* to live among humans. It is the only thing that will *ever* give my writing any depth or interest, the only thing which will give it application.&nbsp; I&nbsp;very much doubt that&nbsp;Alex's beloved Chaucer, her Sontag, her&nbsp;Boccaccio and Dante, spent their lives in a tower of&nbsp;intellectualism.&nbsp; Or that&nbsp;they would want her to.  &nbsp; All that aside, what I've discovered&nbsp;is that, since I was the offended party, most of the house&nbsp;has taken my side in the issue. They all think Alex is&nbsp;right, of course, and can't&nbsp;imagine *what* I'm doing with such trashy novels, but they feel I'm the offended party and they're on my side.&nbsp; I know that hurt&nbsp;Alex, and I have to admit that I took some petty pleasure in being on the winning side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have enough of the machiavellian in me to recognize that while no one was supporting me because they like me, or even because they agree with my viewpoints, they were still agreeing, and the tide of favor was, however subtly, behind me.  &nbsp; What can I say? I'm no saint. I'm actually a very, very horrible individual. Believe me, I never thought anyone was on "my" side. They're only supporting the person who was attacked. Their defense was not for me, but for my defensive stance.&nbsp; &nbsp; But it became clear as the day progressed and my attitude&nbsp;toward&nbsp;Alex did not improve,&nbsp;that there was only so far that they were willing to support my position.&nbsp; Not to mention that I was beginning to feel horrible, because, goddamn it, I don't like being angry at anybody, even if I do think they're being elitist and denying the value and impact of ninety percent of the publishing market.&nbsp;   So we made our pax. Officially, and personally, I appreciate Alex's concern for my intellect, I appreciate her passionate defense of her opinion, and I understand she was not attacking me personally, but rather what she perceives as an ugly blot on the face of literature. (my words, not hers.)&nbsp; She and I have agreed to disagree, and that's that.  But you may be sure that if the fancy strikes me, I'll pick up another trashy novel while I'm here, and I'll certainly keep writing in Ely's journal.&nbsp; Yes, they're egotistical pleasures.&nbsp; But I am an egotistical individual, quite beyond saving by Literature, and I make the decision to be damned.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Hmph.  &nbsp; Gah. As you can tell, I'm still a bit irritable about the whole business. I'm glad it's over, and that Alex and I have made our pax, but I wish the subject had never come up. I'll be raw and snappish for a long while, I suspect.  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      *yawn*   So, the essay got turned in. Good it's not, but it's at least fixable. I like the title, but you'd have to know the story.   In other news, today was cross-dressing day!   I've got about ten or fifteen pictures of all of us dressed up. In the words of one of the professors, my get up was "classy, but a bit pimpish". Must have been the pink and blue striped tie.   Honestly, it wasn't that different from my own clothes, but-   * * *   Okay, sorry about that. I had to give up the computer earlier today to somebody who was doing some work, and they didn't give me a chance to finish my sentence.   It wasn't that different from girl clothes, except that the blazer was a little warm, and the startched linen shirt was itchy. But I liked the tie! Ties are fun- on so many different levels. *grins*   I shall have to add a few to my collection of new clothes.   Anyways, Jordan wore my red halter top. David wore my black stilletto high heels and looked better in them than I ever have. Jim's little black and cream ensemble went perfectly with my new pair of nine-west pumps, though he was nowhere as good at wearing them -and walking- as David. David had some initial issues standing on the heels, and tripped a couple of times, but it was okay. (read: hysterical)   Mmmn. So there was Jordan in his red halter top with stuffed chest, and black miniskirt. Urvesh actually looked goddamn sexy in a little pink hip-hugger skirt, with a white bell-sleeve top and a ribbon in his hair. He looked even better when he put on black nylons. (They hid the hair on his legs, which was the not so cool part of the ensembles). Ben wriggled into a brown corderoy skirt; we got Bryon into a summer-print dress, and Conan wore an orange-and white tropical print skirt with a little white blouse. Lukkas went skanky, and I do mean skanky. I did his makeup, I *know*. (Not to mention his top was approximately the size of a bikini bra. . . ewwwww.)   Tess borrowed a bunch of Jordan's clothes and looked incredibly cute in huge baggy jeans (she even sagged her pants down over her boxers right) and this preppie striped shirt that we all agreed looked perfect when she tucked it in, just in the front. Ashley, aka A-dog, aka Adam, went as the typical hood-lum. Doo rag and all. So Jordan taught her and Tess/Terry how to fight like guys.   Remind me never to piss Ashley off, she fights like a demon, even when she's just flat-palm pushing and trash-talking. (Tess is a ballet dancer, the match was a little uneven.)   And of course there was me, Jennings the butler, in sober pinstripe pants, a neat black blazer, startched linen shirt, and pink-and-blue striped tie. All I needed was a top hat. (One was not, unfortunately, forthcoming.) And Vladmir/Olga, with her neat Russian accent, little French mustache, and aristic  je ne sais quoi . (not to mention the patches in her natty brown jacket.)   All in all? We were a sexy bunch of cross-dressers.   After that, it was kitchen duty for Jen. (And returning the clothes, by necessity.) I'm still wandering around in the pinstripe pants, though, with a teeshirt on over them. I have less fashion sense as a woman, apparently.   And that does it for today. I have some major revisions, but nothing too strenuous for class tomorrow.   Bisou-bisou, y'all.   Jen

      Okay, evil essay of d00m done. I'm so excited I can hardly speak.  Or maybe that's sleep deprivation. Hard to tell at this juncture. (It's three in the morning here.)  I have kitchen shift tomorrow- *yay! I miss cleaning!* (*haha, never thought you'd hear me say that.*) but after that, I'm napping for a couple of hours.  And then going to pubspeaks -the pressure's off there, thank GODS- and then going to bed immediately.   This Sunday will be my three week marker- half-way through. I'll be hiking *back* down to the farmer's market, which will be a lot of fun, since my feet look like raw meat, but will be well worth it.  I've also decided to try to conserve my funds, since I did an accounting today and realized that if I'm trying to bring back money for you guys -and I am!- I need to do a better job of keeping track of where I'm spending and what I'm spending on.   Ideally, I'd like to bring back $150 from the trip. Now let's see if I can manage it. (I figure that's fair, half-half. The other bit of good news is that the majority of my expenses are done with.) Well, except for getting pots for the herbs I bought *last* week.   I'm only going with five dollars this week. Maybe I can manage to rein myself in.   Here's the *very rough* draft of my essay for class later today. *cough five hours cough* I have a lot of personal notes on it, things like changing "subverted" to the word I *meant* to use but can't remember right now because I'm so tired, little critical details like that.   It's one of my longer essays- I'm hoping my editors will chop some deadwood and I can refine it down to something a bit shorter.  Course, I can always cut out the first paragraph after the introduction, and refine the introduction a bit, for a much shorter paper.  I dunno, we'll see.  For now, kiddos, smooches and love. Jen needs sleep.  *zombie stumble up the four flights of stairs to her room*   Jennifer Green Cornell I Week Three Essay July 13, 2004  Vengeance, Served Cold, with Salad on the Side:   	The motif of the subverted husband who revenges himself through bloodshed is common in literature: from Sampson and Delilah to the Count of Monte Cristo, vengeance is as common to the marriage bed as adultery.  Most husbands avenge their honor quickly, with a blade, settling for retribution but not for justice. The stories of those few who wait, and let their betrayer suffer the lingering consequences of betrayal, becoming chilling examples of justice without mercy.  So perhaps this tactic is most fitting for a lawyer and politician, a man concerned with the administration of law.  When the President of the Grenoble Parlement discovers his wife in bed with her lover, his vengeance takes the form of a progression of deceptions, perpetuated not on his deceivers and his friends, but on society as well.  By controlling the semblance of each scene in the tale, and the way it is presented to each character, the older man manipulates their responses, leading each to downfall through assumption and perception.  Legally and lethally elegant, the President’s vengeance allows him to unmake a crime by removing all its witnesses, demonstrating that what was not seen, did not happen.  	Of those deceived by the President in his quest for vengeance, only the old servant ventures to defend his own vision of the truth, the allegation which led him to accuse his master’s wife of adultery.  Believing, from the President’s attitude toward his wife’s possible infidelity, that the older man would not countenance any such slur, the old servant shows his master the lovers in flagrante delecto.  The President does not indicate he has any reason to show mercy to his betrayers, so despite his mention of the second “locked” chamber, the servant never suspects that Nicolas is actually hidden there. In hiding Nicolas and then using the re-staged scene to force the servant to discredit himself, (“The Devil must have carried him off! I saw him come in, and he didn’t come out through the door- yet I can see that he is not here!” (p.354)) the President justifies dismissing the old servant, and thereby removes the only witness of the pair’s wrongdoing.  Both lovers begin the tale as deceivers, echoing the idea that those who dishonor will, in their turn, be dishonored by their victim.  Initially their deception proves successful, but their lack of caution leads a clear-eyed servant to observe their actions and bring word to the President.  In the moments following his discovery of the pair’s adultery, the President places himself in the role of their savior when he elects not to destroy the lover’s reputations instantaneously, then acts to protect them from the accusing eyes of his servant.   Furthermore, he guides the distraught pair into a semblance of gilt and gaiety which helps them to escape censure. For Nicolas, the President’s actions are particularly misleading: despite the shadow of the older man’s dictate that he leave when ordered, the boy believes that the endless round of parties and his apparent favor reflect a real softening in the husband’s attitude toward the liason: “Nicolas, thinking the President had forgotten what had happened . . . ” (p. 355).   The President’s clemency, however, hides careful calculation, and he acts to strip the young man of his illusions at the very moment when Nicolas sees the greatest hope of realizing them, “But after the dace was over, the President . . . whispered into Nicolas’s ear: ‘Leave this place and never return,” (p.355). For the gallant, the President’s lies prove a poignant education in deception. 	For the President’s wife, however, the President’s betrayal is both longer in coming, and more final in restitution.  In encouraging her to focus on appearances, to conceal her deed, the President seems to tacitly accept her actions: indeed, he reveals himself as solicitous to her, at least in social context. “On one occasion he noticed that his wife wasn’t dancing and told Nicolas to be her partner” (p.355).  However, this concern for her social position may not revolve around actual tenderness for her, but desire to avoid scandal: his wife’s later actions, including her trust in her husband, suggest that, regardless of the President’s motive, the lady believes his pretense, at least to the point of trusting greens picked by his own hands.  For her, too, the President’s “sympathy” proves tragically seductive.     	But the President’s piece de resistance lies in the deception he perpetuates on society.  From the first, upon discovering his wife’s infidelity, concern for his family’s reputation goads him to speech, “I do not wish to see my household dishonored or the daughters I have had by you disadvantaged” (p.354).  This desire justifies each of the subsequent –and numerous- deceptions that the President foists on his friends and neighbors.  His instructions to the lovers, encouraging gaiety in dress and manners, provide a diversion for speculation: the glitter of the lady’s attire, the sparkle of Nicolas’s comportment, both serve to distract the eye from their less illustrious –and less lustrous- guilt. And the old man, not content with these measures, adds his own diversionary tactics: first, to immediately dispel any potential public gossip, (“he returned to the Palais de Justice without the slightest hint that anything had happened”) and then, to prepare an alibi for his wife’s eventual downfall, (“The President impressed upon all his relatives, friends and neighbors how much he loved his wife,” (p.355)).  Later, the narrator’s use of litotes (“Then, one fine day in the month of May, he went into his garden and picked some herbs for a salad.  After eating it his wife did not live. . .” (p.355)) emphasizes the parallel between what is not directly said and what is not clearly seen, and the tertiary placement of the declaratory, “the grief that the President showed was so great that nobody suspected he was the agent of her death”  (p.355) contrives to downplay the President’s role in his wife’s death, mimicking society’s own erroneous views.  The President’s careful preparations and his meticulous attention to his lies result in the preservation of his family’s social standing.   	Ultimately, the President’s machinations are successful in erasing his wife’s sin: in a series of measured blows, he destroys a potential threat to his family’s reputation, and simultaneously metes out justice for the real damage to his honor. The President has succeeded in unmaking truth, by removing or discrediting all those who could confirm that truth’s validity. However, the existence of the story –the factual retelling of the man’s cuckholding, and of his vengeance- casts a dubious light on the veracity of the events related.  Either the tale is entirely false, made up on the spot, or else the President’s attempt to preserve his honor failed, his secret shames became known, and all of his convoluted plans came to naught.

      Okay. Pubspeak done. It turned out well. I've gotten a lot of the requisite, "Oh, good job"- read: "You tried to make it good at least, and here's kudos for trying." At least a couple of people have said they were impressed and convinced me they genuinely were, so that helped.   The factora told me my concepts needed to be more fully developed- fair enough. I think so, too. I completely forgot a couple sections I really wanted to talk about. *irritation*  Oh well, it's over now.  No one, myself included, will have to endure that again. I feel justified.   In other news, this weekend's been one long laugh fest. Friday we went to the mall: I got a My Little Pony keychain, a few things less innocent, talked to some strangers. But it was so much fun, because I went with friends and just wandered. We had to be back by dinner, but that was all- no pressure, no thought required.   Saturday was field day- which I presaged with a hike, and I do mean a HIKE, to Farmer's market. A couple of miles, at least, and my feet look like I went barefoot. The market was worth it, though- food everywhere. Crafts everywhere. Art everywhere.   I'd fly you all here just to see their Farmer's Market. Three times the size of the one in Lawrence, if not larger, draws at least five hundred people. (Though probably far more, just in a day) and bustling with all kinds of life, all kinds of folks.   Then it was field day- volleyball, in which I earned a reputation for taking nosedives- and ultimate frisbee, which nearly killed me a couple of times. I took a short break to rest- and then joined in the water balloon fight. I'm having one when I come home. It was just far, far, far too much fun.   Then of course, Sunday, I cooked. The jambalya did as well as my pubspeak. Some people enjoyed it, others just dealt.  That's all I really ask.   Oh, and we practiced for cross-dressing Wednesday. I'll get pictures, I promise. Do you know how hard it is to walk and talk and SIT like a boy?  How crotch oriented everything is? And meanwhile, the guys kept feeling their fake boobs up. So funny.    And now, the real meat of the entry.    Other than that, I stayed up until five this morning talking to Yi-Wen. She and I had a lot to say about TASP, what we think of the program, and about our own respective cultures.   She attends an International School (basically, a school that teaches a standardized curriculum to civil servants' children, ambassador's kids, that group; the schools are scattered all over the world.) and says that there's a developing culture, a Third Culture, in her schools. So many kids there have their birth culture, and the culture of the lands they've lived in/are living in, but call neither culture their own. They're part of a third culture.  Her school is in Malaysia, and being basically at home, she told me, gives her a sense of grounding that these kids down't have.   Thinking about it, I applied that to American culture. So many of my friends have divorced parents- I know only three or four families where the original parents are still together. We -America's children, my generation- have become the new Third Generation of America- not necessarily mobile, but divorced -just in a different sense. Relationships are no more permanent to us than they are to students whose parents move them every couple of years, who have no friend that they do not lose again.  Yi-wen was explaining to me how in her culture, children simply do not question or challenge their parents the way American kids do- she said there's always a sense that parents are doing things, not so that the kids will be hurt or have to suffer, but that they've been there, too, and that they sympathize with the child: they're not just exerting their will. Adults are more respected, their opinions have more weight- it's completely different. She agrees with my assessment, though, that divorce has done more to destroy the position of adults in families than any other institution or social trend.  When you've seen adults behave like children, you lose your awe for age and status, and that loss of awe translates into adjustment problems down the road, more tension between adults and children.  Yi-Wen's third generation is divorced from a sense of home, of a place where they belong.  My third generation is divorced from commitment, from the ability to work for a relationship. We're married to divorce, and to the culture divorce creates.   *sighs*  I really believe, though, that our generation is poised to lash back against that lifestyle, those behaviors. I'm terrified of making vows I may someday find myself unhappy in keeping. I don't want to be unhappy. But I also feel that those vows should be kept. And doesn't that make *me* a hypocrite?   I dunno. I just don't know.  I want to believe I can have a life-long relationship, but I don't know that I can trust myself. Or that I would be able to accept failing at one.   Yeah. I really just don't know.   Anyway, we also talked about how TASP is indescribable- but finally came to the conclusion that the best way to describe it is that it's a cult. The enforced "no visitors" rule? That requires us to associate and depend on one another. To live with one another, not just in the same house. And the intellectual intensity takes the place of religious zealotry or whatever- we're all smart, we can talk about just about anything.  But there's something else, I don't know how to explain. Talking to Yi-wen last night, I just kept feeling it over and over. There's something in her that is in me, too. There were times we started completing each other's sentences- we knew what each other meant, before it was said, and could often define it better together than separately. The similarities in our thought process are astonishing, and there're friendships, echoes, really, like that all throughout the house.   There's something alike, in all of us who are TASPers. It's not intellect. It's not sociability. It's not background. Sure as HELL not background. It's a view of the world, or a view of ourselves and our places in it- and there's a pride, because we were chosen for whatever it is about us, even though we don't know what it is.   I know and love you all, but there's no way I can explain to you what Telluride is. I don't like saying it's a cult, because that's so negative. And there's nothing I can say, "Oh, it's a summer program," "Oh, it's a semi-monastic community" "Oh, it's a gender studies seminar" that won't force you to view it through lens of your own experiences. But that distorts it until you can't understand what it is, and what it isn't- you lose sight of whatever that little flicker is, in the thirty two of us, whatever it is that we were chosen for, when you try to see it through your own experiences. I don't even know how to explain what it's like, I don't know how to explain who and what I am here.   I know, however, that if you were able to see my soul, my mind, as I walk off the plane in August, you wouldn't recognize them. What I feel for you all hasn't changed. The fundamental tenets of my character, the things that make me your friend, your daughter, your girlfriend, your companion, those haven't changed.  But the mind that governs and is governed by those tenets, that character- that mind has changed. Two weeks, and I don't think like I did. And I can't tell you what changed, only that it's there, the change is real.   I will come back, and I"ll go through my year of school, but I know more than ever that my mind won't be in it. I'll be learning, yes, I still need to learn. But I've gotten used to a different way of thinking, a different way of learning, and I don't know how I'll ever manage to go back.

      Erg.   It's one here. That means it's Friday- and that I've gone through almost another week here. Four more to go.   It's not that I'm eager to leave. I'm not. I love it here. I wish you guys could experience this- it would completely change your attitude toward schools and teaching. We teach ourselves here, and I do mean that in the best possible way. The professors toss in bits of information, point out things we've missed, but mostly it's the group debating over interpretations, arguing over the significance of this or that point, trying to come to a final resolution about what really happened. It's pretty close to Ms. Chapman's class, but- there's a limit to how much freedom even she can give us in class.   You know what? It makes me want to appeal for a new Independent Study. A program like this one, Socratic style.  Crap. Now I have to go write Mr. Frederick and beg him to let me start one. Ye gods.   Besides all that, the Renaisance Festival is spinning out. I have to talk to the group who's going, and despite that, when I called a meeting for it, about five people showed up. It's really frustrating; I know what needs to be said, it'll take five minutes, and I can't go any further without the meeting.   *faceplant*  Besides all of that, I had a discussion with Jason. Josh, you know *exactly* who I'm talking about. Said discussion is why my head hurts right now, and why I really just want to go to sleep. I don't know why I listen to what he says- except that it seems wrong to me that any individual in the world should have something to say and no one to listen, and the vague belief that maybe if I listen, if I try to be sympathetic, if I genuinely consider his arguments and refuse to walk away, I'll make some kind of impression on him. I feel like I'm arguing against him for all women -not because I think we're a good group, or even because I think he's wrong, but just so that he won't condemn us all without giving individuals a chance. Since I can't think of many crimes I consider worse than categorizing people, you can see why this is a crusade of mine.  And given his stated opinon of women, you also understand why I have to fight this battle on my own. Much as I appreciate everyone's concern, your support of me, your desire to protect me, I can't let you interfere, because in doing so, I relinquish any hope of changing his opinion, and potentially convince him he's absolutely right in his views.   I admit, a lot of the time, his arguments hurt, on a purely personal level. I don't like listening to him argue, and realizing I possess no real weapons, in numbers or in language, against him. He is frighteningly accute, frighteningly intent on his views, and it is hard to oppose him. I don't like doing it.  But I'm convinced that there's someone out there who's going to get hurt by his attitude, a woman, maybe even his daughter, who will be hurt by his opinions as they stand. I know talking to him hurts me, and I hate to think of somebody else who cares about him deeply getting scoured by some of his views. Even our status as friends doesn't protect me from his often barbed comments; I am lucky that I can ask for a ceasefire.  It's a priviledge, and I appreciate it when his arguments start to make me wonder about my own worth.   Still- for all he's said, he'll never convince me that I am, by virtue of my gender, the social leech he seems to see in me.   And before you get all upset,  mes infants - he'll never convince me because I have friends who value me, family that loves me, and so long as I can look at you guys and say, "These people care about me, these people believe I help them, or that I am capable of being a positive force in their lives," then he can't touch me. All I need to refute his generalizations, his sweeping arguments, is that single, quiet voice in me that says, "Whatever you think of other people, of other women, I  am not   them, I am myself, and I live a life that is justified by those I love, and who love me."   That's all I need, period. Mental stimulation and love as justification.  For now, though, I also need to finish this bloody paper. So g'night to you all. Enjoy the most recent update of Elyssa's blog.   Oh, and for god's sake, I enabled comments so you lot could tell me about inaccuracies, make corrections, suggestions, etc. So use them.  Cheerio!  Jen  Oh, and here's the final text of the essay I just finished. Read and, hopefully, enjoy.   In his unabashedly bawdy tale of the affair between a young girl and a holy man, Decameron narrator Dioneo rides roughshod over decorum and the conventions of his time: though the young man’s earthy language and irreverence shields the serious nature of his topic, the very humor which makes his tale so appealing also serves to goad his readers into thought. In his tale, “The Devil in Hell”, 	Dioneo establishes a fine situational irony, defusing potential criticism with laughter and making conqueror of the conquered, prey of the pursuer.  	Seen from Dioneo’s position of omniscience, the hermit Rustico’s careful premeditation on Alibech’s seduction, and swift application of his chosen plan, mark him as the active party in the lover’s affair.  Indeed, the man’s careful strategizing takes the form of a rhetorical argument, recounted in a detached third person, rather than direct quotation of the man’ thoughts. First Rustico defines the problem, his desire to conceal the impurity of his motives from Alibech, while still obtaining his pleasures.  Then, using her genuine naiveté, Rustico creates a metaphor which ties his hunger for sexual release to her preoccupation with piety, and presents the correlation within an irrefutable spiritual context: “He began with great eloquence to show her how much of an enemy the Devil was to God, and . . . that no service could be more pleasing to God than to put the Devil back in Hell” (p.278).  Rustico’s careful calculation and subsequent actions mark him as the initial aggressor in the relationship. 	By contrast, Alibech’s inexperience and credulity make her the recipient of Rustico’s attentions.  Dioneo twice emphasizes Alibech’s innocence, once in introducing her character, (the voice of Rustico’s thoughts, (“-she was really just as naïve as she appeared” [p.278]), and once in introducing her character  Alibech’s ingenuous questions about Rustico’s anatomy, and her adherence to the euphemisms “Devil” and “Hell” throughout the story suggests the careful repetition of a child taught by rote.  Even as she becomes more familiar with lust, Alibech clings to the labels laid down by Rustico, as a student to the teachings of her hierophant.   	Yet after Alibech “sends the Devil to Hell” for the first time, her attitude toward the act undergoes a marked change. The young woman becomes an avid proponent of this particular “salvation”, so much so that she exhausts the hermit (“-after the seventh time, the Devil found it impossible to rear his arrogant head” [p.279]).  Her introduction to the rewards of faith proves so entrancing that Alibech is entirely converted: meanwhile, the contrast between the woman’s belief in her own piety and the reader’s knowledge of her veniality creates a humor only further emphasized by the unlikely juxtaposition of the religious and carnal. “Now I certainly understand what those good men in Capsa meant when they said that serving God was so pleasurable” (p.278).  Alibech’s growing willingness to “serve the lord” becomes a euphemism for her growing desire, and she invokes this parallel frequently in her appeals to Rustico.  Though the young woman does not comprehend the incongruity in her substitution of “faith’ for “pleasure”, she has become enamored with loving, and her fascination with redemption marks the beginning of the story’s true comedy, as Alibech artlessly turns the tables on Rustico, making predator into prey.  	Rustico, for his part, finds himself the possessor of an embarrassment of riches: having lured the lady to lust, he now suffers for his success.  Initially he tries rhetoric to cool her passion, suggesting that the Devil needs subduing only when up to no good. When this does not extinguish Alibech’s ardor, however, Rustico becomes exasperated, as reflected in his indirect address, “So he told her that to quench the fires of her Hell would require a hell of a lot of devils” (p. 280).  The blunt wordplay between “Hell” and the accompanying blasphemy, and the correlation between the fires of the underworld and Alibech’s fiery desire all emphasize  Rustico’s hellacious predicament: having indoctrinated an innocent, the hermit must tame his newly-converted hellion.  	Alibech, enlightened to the pleasures of piety by Rustico’s teachings, yet retains her innocence of the greater social context of her “salvation’, an ignorance which contributes to a humorous and axiomatic conclusion for Dioneo’s tale.   Her full appetites aroused, she chastises the hermit for not repaying her earlier generosity, “It’s all well and good that your Devil is punished and no longer bothers you, but my Hell will not leave me alone; so you ought to have your Devil help me,” (p. 280) in parallel to Rustico’s earlier, rhetorical seduction, Alibech now falls back on logical entreaties to obtain the sexual satisfaction she seeks, pursuing a lover both unable, and increasingly unwilling, to fulfill her desires.  	Ultimately, it is laughter which redeems Rustico and Alibech in the reader’s eyes: laughter for the unlikely juxtaposition of religious and carnal imagery, yes.  Laughter for Rustico’s predicament, for Alibech’s naiveté, yes. But also laughter for relief from social discomfort.  No one can ignore the frequent reminders of Rustico’s religious authority, or Alibech’s innocence: the reiteration of “father” and “my child” is too pronounced.  What a didactic lecture on clerical veniality could not have accomplished, the insinuations and humor of Dioneo’s tale readily achieve. Despite their guffaws, readers cannot disregard the religious implications of the tale, and in struggling to justify the humor of the situation, they must also, finally, examine and acknowledge the underlying social concern.

      God, I wish you guys were here to read this stuff.   *Cracks up laughing*  If ever, EVER, any of you have had the idea that the classics are stuffy, boring, or overly concerned with chastity, read the Decameron. Read it anyway, even if you were never so foolishly mislead as to believe what we were taught in history. It's a laugh fest, complete with a few moments of sheer. . .   0   0                         _o_            Anyway, here's my essay, due *coff* in five hours. Enjoy.   And yes, I'm talking about what you think I'm talking about. *smirks*   Jennifer Green Cornell 1 Essay Two July 4, 2004  Alibech and Rustico:    	In defining Rustico as pursuer, and Alibech as pursued, then using “loaded” diction, extended euphemism, and humorous antithesis to reverses the lovers’ roles, Dioneo establishes a fine situational irony, defusing potential criticism with laughter and making conqueror of the conquered, prey of the pursuer.  	Rustico’s internal debate, prior to his seduction of Alibech, characterizes the young hermit as pursuer.  Seen from an omniscient perspective, his careful strategizing takes the form of a rhetorical argument: first Rustico defines the problem –his desire to conceal the impurity of his motives from Alibech, while still obtaining his pleasures.

Alibech’s ingenuous questions about Rustico’s anatomy, and her adherence to the euphemisms “Devil” and “Hell” throughout the story echo the curiosity and careful repetition of a child taught by rote.

Ultimately, Dioneo uses a pervasive, situational irony, supported by euphemism, wordplay, contrasting juxtapositions, and rhetorical strategies, to cast Rustico’s affair with Alibech in a humorous rather than censorious light.

      All right, guys. Bad news.  So, we had a house meeting today, and during the meeting, the question of individual computer usage came up.   End result?   I'm not going to be online nearly as much. While I wasn't mentioned by name, it was clear that people are tired of seeing me in here all the time on the computer. TASP is, after all, about "community". (And you wouldn't believe how tired I am of hearing that.)  And while there's a minority of us who are AIM dependent and really didn't like the idea, the upshot is that AIM use is going to be limited by our "common sense" and "consideration", which basically means, "only when you don't have a paper due, or someone else doesn't have a paper due". Which is near-to none of the time.  Basically, if you want to talk to me, email me. I'll be on AIM only at predetermined times which I will post in this blog. If you can't make it at a time I mention, don't worry, but if you can, I'll appreciate it, as it will mean I am able to actually talk to you.   *eyeroll*  Anyway, kiddos, love to ya. I'll talk to ya'll later.

      Mmmn, haven't done much posting this weekend: my apologies.  I've been busy with all kinds of things, a large portion of which has been cleaning and sleeping -or not sleeping, as the case may be- (stayed up until four this morning).   Right now, however, I'm content. I have a cup of tea-juice (earl grey teabag + hot cranberry juice) and I have a slew of ideas running through my head.   So, Josh finally -finally- convinced me to run a campaign.  And, of course, the first campaign I do is NOT Vampire: Masquerade. It is, of all things, Werewolf.   Well, who knew?   Don't get me wrong, Vampire -and the Tremere- has always and will always be my first love. But one must grow, and one must change, and to remove all the sentimental BS, the idea I had only works within the strictures of the Werewolf universe. But it is- I hope, hope, hope- a good idea, one which will attract a number of serious players.   I'll be really frank now, since Josh is troubleshooting my makeup of this and has promised to hold off the rule jockeys, I only want serious RPGers, or those with serious character ideas, to apply.  Not saying it can't be funny- but if you're not in character, I'll get out my "Storyteller thumping stick of DOOM" and you'll be in for it.   Anybody reading this blog is welcome to talk to me about character ideas or ask questions. I'll tell you now that you will be set smack down in the highlands of Columbia, but that you won't necessarily sta there, and this campaign will put you, not only in wilderess settings, but through cosmopolitan areas as well. I can also promise that you will be able to accomplish with murder and mayhem, you will be able to accomplish better, or at least as easily, with guile and intelligence.  Ultimately, however, I will permit almost any character that has potential and thought behind it, provisio on Josh approving your stats and suchlike.   Yes, so anyone who wants to send me a Werewolf book, I'd appreciate it, since I now need to learn the rules well enough to Storytell. *winces*  God, I have no idea why I'm even trying to do this. . . but, damnit, the plot calls to me.   I should just write it and give it to somebody to run. I don't know where I got the illusion I could do this.  But feck it all, I'm going to at least try. And any of you that ride my ass, I'll take your face off with a crowbar.  *is getting into the werewolf spirit, perhaps a bit too much*  Anyway! Besides all that, I've got to go start reading my Decameron homework before I get into too much trouble for having done *nothing* with my weekend.   *kisses*  Toodles!  Jen

      Today's been a rollercoast ride, emotionally. Up and down and up again.   I woke up this morning tired, and it made me quiet and uncommunicative in seminar. These past two days, I feel like I've contributed nothing to the discussion, besides another set of ears. It disgusts me, makes me frustrated with myself. I came here to participate, and I know I'm at my best in a discussion, but I've been so tired I haven't given  any  real substance to the last couple days' discussion. It didn't help that I haven't actually read the letters of direction, either. Or I have, but not in depth, with nothing like the attention I need to actively discuss them. Makes me angry with myself, too.   Anyway, here's the final copy of my essay. Much better than my first.   Jennifer Green  Cornell TASP I  Assignment I  June 28, 2004                   But as I have already distressed you by mentioning the dangers which beset me or the death I fear, it was done in accordance with your own request, or rather, entreaty.  For the first letter you wrote me has a passage which says: ‘And so in the name of Christ, who is still giving you some protection for this service, we beseech you to write as often as you think fit to us who are his handmaids and yours, with news of the perils in which you are still storm-tossed.  We are all that are left you, so at least you should let us share your sorrow or your joy.  It is always some consolation in sorrow to feel that it is shared, and any burden laid on several is carried more lightly or removed.’ Why then do you accuse me of making you share my anxiety when I was forced to do so at your own behest?  When I am suffering in despair of my life, would it be fitting for you to be joyous? Would you want to be partners only in joy, not grief, to join in rejoicing without weeping with those who weep? There is no wider distinction between true friends and false than the fact that the former share adversity the later only prosperity. Say no more, I beg you, and cease from complaints like these which are so far removed from the true depths of love! (p.142-3)  The bitter denouement of a love deeply felt is one of the most painful experiences in the human repertoire, and few stories of faded passion are as enduring as that of Heloise and Abelard.  The two lover’s struggle to resolve Heloise’s lingering love for her husband with Abelard’s insistence on the redirection of her affections is illuminated in bittersweet clarity in their personal letters. In the cited passage, Abelard utilizes loaded diction, a series of rhetorical queries, and an axiomatic conclusion to compel Heloise to accept a more detached and limited relationship, one at odds with her professed and passionate love for him.   However impersonal the clarity of Abelard’s rhetorical techniques, his inflammatory use of antagonistic diction throughout the excerpt serves as both challenge and admonition for Heloise, forcing her to defend her emotional entreaties.  The repetition of verbs of force- “accuse”, “making”, “forced”, “behest” (p.142) emphasizes Abelard’s unwillingness to share his trials with her, and subtly castigates Heloise for her importunate appeals. The modification of the neutral “request” to the more charged “entreaty”, (p.142) with all the connotations of supplication and submission attendant therein, highlights the highly personal nature of Heloise’s request.  The use of “entreaty” also echoes Heloise’s use of “beseech” and her invocation of Christ in the cited paragraph, indicating that, though he may elect not to respond to the sentiment of Heloise’s imprecation, Abelard recognizes the emotional manipulation inherent in her rhetoric.  The monk’s diction suggests a frustration with Heloise’s abrupt switch from a reasonable, if reproachful, letter, to a plaintive and emotional demand, an irritation with her nostalgic affection for their onetime union, and echoes his frequent his exhortations to her to turn her attentions to their God, rather than dwell on their lost love. This expression of irritation, combined with the accusatory tone of the passage, places Heloise in the position of defending her appeal.  Rhetorically speaking, the stance which his diction forces upon her renders Heloise more vulnerable to his later insinuations about his expectations for her and their relationship.  The insistent, forceful rhythm established by Abelard’s use of three subsequent rhetorical questions pushes Heloise further into her logical corner, and introduces the behavioral expectations which Heloise must meet to continue their correspondence.  The initial question “Why then do you accuse me . . ?” (p.142) is itself accusatory, creating an internal irony and hypocrisy: even as Abelard censures Heloise for her allegations and demands, he peppers her with allegations and demands of his own.  Abelard then modifies his tone: the accusation fades, replaced by a more moderate, ethical censure: “When I am suffering in despair of my life, would it be fitting for you to be joyous?” (p.142). Here, too, is hypocrisy: even as Abelard attacks Heloise for her emotional attachment to him, his question implies that it is inappropriate that she not view his sufferings with compassion. Finally, the censure fades into insinuation, suggesting the relationship which Abelard now expects –and requires- from Heloise: “Would you want to be partners only in joy, not grief, to join in rejoicing without weeping with those who weep?” (p.142). Abelard’s use of “partners only in joy” subtly defines the new connection which he desires of Heloise: there is no room in the monk’s rhetoric for a relationship beyond the scope of “partners” or “friends”, no opportunity for Abelard’s erstwhile lover to interject another potential model for their relationship.  She has only the choice between his two proffered levels of companionship.  By neatly sidestepping the personal implications of her appeal, presented through the channel of her responsibilities to her nuns, and focusing instead on the intellectual aspects of their relationship, Abelard subtly indicates the standard of behavior that he anticipates of her in the future.   The conclusion of Abelard’s argument is noteworthy for its synthesis of the man’s views and the logician’s rhetoric: “There is no wider distinction between true friends and false than the fact that the former share adversity the later only prosperity” (p.143). The repetition of grammatical structure in the “former share adversity the latter only prosperity” and the parallelism in “true friends” in “adversity” and “false” in “prosperity” are both rhetorical techniques which render the closing axiomatic.  The irrefutability of the maxim lends further weight to the assumption of friendship on which it is based, and allows Abelard to steamroller his one-time bride into accepting his redefinition of their relationship.  The maxim also carries an implied threat: if Heloise protests relegation to the status of a mere “friend”, she risks appearing “false” to the man she loves, an alternative unpalatable in the face of her deep dedication.  With deft use of rhetoric, diction, and insinuation, Abelard presents his one-time lover with a subtle but compelling ultimatum, finally forcing Heloise to accept his dispassionate reinterpretation of their relationship.

      And thus it ends.  I'm flying out today; my bus comes in twenty minutes or so. Everyone is tired and a little weepy. That's okay, we've been tired and weepy since Wednesday, when we had our "Closure" Meeting. Which helped relieve some of the tears, but did little to alleviate the overall sense of being wrested from people we really care about. I'm lucky, I have my friends to go back to. All of you guys, if not the same as those I've met here, are incredible. I'm lucky. I come home to you. Many of my friends here aren't coming home to your equivalent, though. I am doubly blessed to know them, and you.  For now, though, I'm trying hard to be cheerful. I really don't want to be red-eyed and weepy by the time the shuttle arrives. We've been giving people sendoffs all morning, but each crowd is smaller. Ashley and I are leaving together; we're the third group to go. Maybe some people will turn out -I hope so.  Over the last few days, I think I've sorted out, a bit better, where I fit in TASP. I'm not particularly popular, or especially loved, but I'm well liked, and I know Ashley is a favorite of almost everyone. Maybe that will be a draw- I'd like to have a crowd to wave me off, if only so that I can see everybody who's here one last time. It  is  wrenching to think that some of these people, I may never see again. We've done a lot of things to get in touch, and we'll stay in touch (despite my shoddy email writing habits) but the physical intimacy of living together will be gone.  I expected to be waiting with bated breath for the moment my shuttle arrived. For weeks, I couldn't wait to go home. And now I find that my home has expanded to include a small corner of the Cornell campus -and that to get to the one, I have to leave the other.  So my breath's catching here, now and again, and sometimes it's joy, and sometimes it's tears, and I don't know which until I breath through it and feel the lingering warmth or ache.  One of the things we talked about at the Closure Meeting (or, as I've dubbed it, the anti-composure meeting) is how we've all grown so much. Josh said it well -here Josh, not Lawrence Josh- when he said that he felt like parts of each of us had been grafted on to him, become part of who he was. I laughed about it at the time, and joked that pretty soon we'd have become one massive, oozing TASP entity, but it's the truth. Little parts of me now have other names on them, Tess and Robin and Josh and Matt and David and Jim and Katie and Olga- the list goes on. Thirty three other names, and thirty three new facets to my personality.  I think I may just be going schitzo.  TASP does that to people, I think.  But I also think this has easily been the most formative experience of my life, and I won't know how formative until I get home and start to test myself against the old hurdles, the old challenges. And as sad as I am to leave, I can feel how much I've changed, and I know I have to go back and run this last race, finish this last year. I really hate the mission statement of our year- "Trustees of the Universe" but in some elitist way I feel it's true.  The people here are something more than most, and have the potential to achieve so much.  And though we disperse now, in time I think the nets of our influence, our beliefs,

      So, pubspeaks tonight.   1) Katie talks about photography 2) Urvesh talks about Porn.  3) Olga talks about sexuality in fairytales.  Do we see a trend? *grins*  Anyway, a very interesting night. I didn't learn much new from Urvesh's presentation, but I think that's mostly a result of all my romance novel reading. For all their sins, romance novels give you a very clear picture of the underground sex culture in history. Still, it was well presented. (Though Jen was a little surprised to be referenced during the Erotica portion of the night's entertainment. "Well, if you'd like to know more about erotica, I'd talk to Jenny. . . ."   Jen: *blinkblink*  My romance novels apparently qualify me as an expert.   More later, gotta dash now.

      Wow. Life after TASP. It's a different world. Very different. Less secure, broader, more frightening, but at the same time, less insurmoutable. Conquerable. Like a mountain of glass. It can be climbed, but it might shatter beneath you.  Things I've learned from TASP:  1) I am capable of second guessing myself to the point of crippling uncertainty. How many times did I want to be asked to go somewhere, and how many times did I hold back? Exactly as many times as I now regret.   2) Uncertainty is sometimes well-merited. I have lost a great deal of confidence in myself, my social abilities. Even today, among friends, I found myself listening into the silence after I cracked a joke, and inwardly cringing, thinking back to failed attempts at humor during TASP.   3) Nothing hurts more than wasted opportunity. How I wish I'd had the balls to open my mouth and sing "Foggy Dew" at Telluride Cafe. If I had, perhaps I would have made place for myself in that larger community, the greater body I never seemed to be affiliated with.   4) Keep your mouth shut. You learn more.   5) There're few pleasures like hearing other people speak your views, particularly when you know you contributed to their formation, and you aren't "recognized" as their originator. That's subversive, and that's Tremere, but it's true. It's also one of the most effective ways to contribute to a discussion if you've accidentally blown your rhetorical hand. Or if everyone knows your position. . .   6) The greatest triumph is being able to hug your enemy and realize they've become your friend. Sappy as that sounds. There was a time I was furious with Alex.  When I finally got up the guts to hug her at the end of TASP, though, it meant so much, because I knew there had been a time when we couldn't have managed it, and when she wouldn't have wanted me to or allowed it.   7) If you think you have backing for a project, act FAST. It's easy to see your support trickle away in waves and waves of votes and queries. People get bored fast, particularly voting constituents.   Other than all of that, I've come home to a mother who's neck deep in Depression/Mania. It's hard to tell, I think it's depression, though.  She's wandering around aimlessly, smoking heavily, talking to herself,  laughing  to herself, stumbling, slow, incoherent, sulky, immature. I do prefer this to Mania, I do. . . but it's scary too, in its own way. It's frightening when she's whispering to herself, mumbling to herself, staring at you all the time.   God I hate this. I hope, I hope, I hope, that I never put my children through this.
