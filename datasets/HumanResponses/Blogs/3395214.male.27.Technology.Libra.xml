        "The beautiful irony of saying no to others is that it ultimately makes your relationships better, not worse. By reclaiming the time and space in your life to pursue your own priorities and dreams, you become more available, not less. Use the power that's rightfully yours. To the best life you can envision, say yes!"                                                                                                                                                             - Patti Breitman       YOUR `can-do' attitude has gotten you where you are today- professionally secure and content. But then, suddenly you find yourself in a spot. You know that saying `yes' can be disastrous, while saying `no' is unimaginable! Why is it that you have such a hard time saying no? Believe it or not saying `no' is an effective management tool. For whatever reason -- moral, financial, and political or for the sake of your own career advancement -- you must be able to say `no' somewhere to someone. The earlier you learn it, the better it is for your career and your company. Saying `No' ain't so bad and doing it right will keep you on a roll!    Some classic instances that we come face to face in our day to day lives:    Employees    A star employee comes up to you with a proposal. While it could be a great one, it might not be the best option in the prevailing circumstances. So this calls for you to say the dreaded `no'.. .   Tread gently, but don't back out or buckle under the strain. While turning down his proposal, make a commitment to him that you will get back to him when the right time comes. Also make sure that he understands why you couldn't action his proposal. Leave no room for misgivings to mar the relationship.    Superiors    As a manager you don't have to always say `yes' to your superiors. Your superior may appreciate it when you recommend a strategic decision. But you're likely to get his undivided attention if you don't endorse a decision taken by him. Especially, if it's backed by relevant facts as to why the decision could backfire. Even the best boss can make a mistake. So if by saying `no' you bail him out of a sticky situation, you would have earned your raise.   When things don't work out your gumption in saying `no' will vindicate your stand.    Clients    When in business, you have to do everything you can to get and keep your clients. You may have to put up with undue pressure from the client time and again. This may be due to last moment change in requirements, Design Mismatch, short deadlines,  24*7 expectation from the client when the contract doesn't say so, Sufficient time not provided for Testing and the likes of them. You've got to say 'NO', assertively and not aggresively, to get your point accross until both you and the client come up with a proper working base, that is a perfect solution to both. Keep your client happy by keeping him rightly informed and not making false commitments.   If your decision goes against the collective opinion then call for a meeting of all the concerned people and explain why, what you are doing is in the best interests of the company terms of money and resources.      Learn how to say 'NO'       Remind yourself now and then that:    You have the right to say no without feeling guilty  Others have the right to say no to you  Saying yes when you really mean no may reduce your feelings of self-worth  It's better to say no at the time than to let somebody down later  Saying yes to extra work or obligations might cause you stress  Taking on too much might lower your standard of work or mean that the people  Important in your life don't get their due attention  It might not be such a big deal to the other person to get a no response  Be respected and respecting yourself is more important than being liked    DOs   UNDERSTAND / REALIZE that you are Saying NO to the Request / Job/ Task, NOT to the Person  Make Decision based on your Priorities, not by the pressure  State refusal at beginning of reply  Be Assertive  Express confident tone  Maintain erect body posture & Eye Contact (reflect Honesty & Confidence)  Be calm, polite  Be Matter of fact  Be brief with you responses  Respect your time  Communicate understanding  Suggest alternative source of help  Calmly repeat your refusal in a persistent, brief way    DON'Ts   Give lengthy list of excuses  Apologize  Stammer, pause, hesitate, or burst out your reply  Lose eye contact or convey other non verbal signs of discomfort  Raise your voice or allow yourself to become enraged     Some Wrong ways we use to say 'No'    "Sure, sounds great! I'll call you when done!" You never heard back from the person  "I'll take care of it." - the person lulls you into a false sense of security to get you off his / her back. No follow-up after that  "Yeah.. hmmm .. I will work on this"  "I have this appointment in the next week; and I have to finish this work by Friday; I am not sure I can take this"    Some Discreet  ways  of saying 'NO'    "I understand that it is important for you, let me see what are the options available"  "Can this wait till Monday?"  "Please help me understand, why do you want it to be done by today?"  "I'm so honored that you asked me. But, this is an especially busy week.         Unfortunately, I won't be able to fit it in."  "I can't. I always have a high-priority activities on Mondays"    Little to lose, much to gain    Say `no' if it goes against your work ethic and job responsibilities. While this may not be a pleasant task, it will certainly pay in the long run.

       " No success in material terms is worthwhile unless it serves the needs and interests of the country and its people, and is achieved by fair and honest means ." JRD Tata (1940-1993)   JRD Tata: An Angry letter from a young lady made JRD Tata change his rule. Sudha Murthy was livid when a job advertisement posted by a Tata company at the institution where she was completing her postgraduation stated that "Lady candidates need not apply". She dashed off a postcard to JRD Tata, protesting against the discrimination. Following this, Mrs. Murthy was called for an interview and she became the first female engineer to work on the shop floor at Telco (now Tata Motors). It was the beginning of an association that would change her life in more ways than one. ----------------------------------------------------------- " THERE are two photographs that hang on my office wall. Everyday when I enter my office I look at them before starting my day. They are pictures of two old people. One is of a gentleman in a blue suit and the other is a black and white image of a man with dreamy eyes and a white beard. People have often asked me if the people in the photographs are related to me. Some have even asked me, "Is this black and white photo that of a Sufi saint or a religious Guru?" I smile and reply "No, nor are they related to me. These people made an impact on my life. I am grateful to them." "Who are they?" "The man in the blue suit is Bharat Ratna JRD Tata and the black and white photo is of Jamshetji Tata." "But why do you have them in your office?" " You can call it gratitude." Then, invariably, I have to tell the person the following story. It was a long time ago. I was young and bright, bold and idealistic. I was in the final year of my Master's course in Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore, then known as the TATA Institute. Life was full of fun and joy. I did not know what helplessness or injustice meant. It was probably the April of 1974. Bangalore was getting warm and gulmohars were blooming at the IISc campus. I was the only girl in my postgraduate department and was staying at the ladies' hostel. Other girls were pursuing research in different departments of Science. I was looking forward to going abroad to complete a doctorate in computer science. I had been offered scholarships from Universities in the US. I had not thought of taking up a job in India.  "One day, while on the way to my hostel from our lecture-hall complex, I saw an advertisement on the notice board. It was a standard job-requirement notice from the famous automobile company Telco (now Tata Motors). It stated that the company required young, bright engineers, hardworking and with an excellent academic background, etc. At the bottom was a small line: "Lady candidates need not apply." I read it and was very upset. For the first time in my life I was up against gender discrimination. Though I was not at all interested in the job itself, I saw it as a challenge. I had done extremely well in academics, better than most of my male peers. Little did I know then that in real life, academic excellence is not enough to be successful. After reading the notice I went fuming to my room. I decided to inform the top most person in Telco's management about the injustice the company was perpetrating. I got a postcard and started to write, but there was a problem: I did not know who headed Telco. I thought it must be one of the Tatas. I knew JRD Tata was the head of the Tata Group; I had seen his pictures in newspapers (actually, Sumant Moolgaokar was the company's Chairman then). I took the card, addressed it to JRD and started writing. To this day I remember clearly what I wrote. "The great Tatas have always been pioneers. They are the people who started the basic infrastructure industries in India, such as iron and steel, chemicals, textiles and locomotives.They have cared for higher education in India, since 1900 and they were responsible for the establishment of the Indian Institute of Science. Fortunately, I study there. But I am surprised how a company such as Telco is discriminating on the basis of gender."  I posted the letter and forgot about it. Less than 10 days later, I received a telegram stating that I had to appear for an interview at Telco's Pune facility at the company's expense. I was taken aback by the telegram. My hostel mate told me I should use the opportunity to go to Pune free of cost and buy them the famous Pune saris for cheap! I collected Rs 30 each from everyone who wanted a sari. When I look back, I feel like laughing at the reasons for my going, but back then they seemed good enough to make the trip. It was my first visit to Pune and I immediately fell in love with the city. To this day it remains dear to me. I feel as much at home in Pune as I do in Hubli, my hometown. The place changed my life in so many ways. As directed, I went to Telco's Pimpri office for the interview. There were six people on the panel and I realised then that this was serious business. "This is the girl who wrote to JRD," I heard somebody whisper as soon as I sat down. By then I knew for sure that I would not get the job. The realisation abolished all fear from my mind, so I was rather cool while the interview was being conducted. Even before the interview started, I reckoned the panel was biased, so I told them, rather impolitely, "I hope this is only a technical interview." They were taken aback by my rudeness, and even today I am ashamed about my attitude. The panel asked me technical questions and I answered all of them. Then an elderly gentleman with an affectionate voice told me, "Do you know why we said lady candidates need not apply? The reason is that we have never employed any ladies on the shop floor. This is not a co-ed college; this is a factory. When it comes to academics, you are a first ranker throughout. We appreciate that, but people like you should work in research laboratories."  I was a young girl from small-town Hubli. My world had been a limited place. I did not know the ways of large corporate houses and their difficulties, so I answered, "But you must start somewhere, sometime, otherwise no woman will ever be able to work in your factories."  Finally, after a long interview, I was told I had been successful. So this was what the future had in store for me. Never had I thought I would take up a job in Pune. I met a shy young man from Karnataka there, we became good friends and we got married..... It was only after joining Telco that I realised who JRD was: the uncrowned king of Indian industry. Now I was scared, but I did not get to meet him till I was transferred to Bombay. One day I had to show some reports to Mr Moolgaokar, our chairman, who we all knew as SM. I was in his office on the first floor of Bombay House (the Tata headquarters) when, suddenly JRD walked in. That was the first time I saw "aapro JRD". Aapro means "our" in Gujarati. This was the affectionate term by which people at Bombay House called him. I was feeling very nervous, remembering my postcard episode. SM introduced me nicely, "Jeh (that's what his close associates called him), this young woman is an engineer and that too a postgraduate. She is the first woman to work on the Telco shop floor." JRD looked at me. I was praying he would not ask me any questions about my interview (or the postcard that preceded it). Thankfully, he didn't. Instead, he remarked. "It is nice that girls are getting into engineering in our country. By the way, what is your name?"  "When I joined Telco I was Sudha Kulkarni, Sir," I replied. "Now I am Sudha Murthy." He smiled a kindly smile and started a discussion with SM. As for me, I almost ran out of the room. After that I used to see JRD on and off. He was the Tata Group chairman and I was merely an engineer. There was nothing that we had in common. I was in awe of him. One day I was waiting for Murthy, my husband, to pick me up after office hours. To my surprise I saw JRD standing next to me. I did not know how to react. Yet again I started worrying about that postcard. Looking back, I realise JRD had forgotten about it. It must have been a small incident for him, but not so for me. "Young lady, why are you here?" he asked. "Office time is over." I said, "Sir, I'm waiting for my husband to come and pick me up." JRD said, "It is getting dark and there's no one in the corridor. I'll wait with you till your husband comes." I was quite used to waiting for Murthy, but having JRD waiting alongside made me extremely uncomfortable. I was nervous. Out of the corner of my eye I looked at him. He wore a simple white pant and shirt. He was old, yet his face was glowing. There wasn't any air of superiority about him. I was thinking, "Look at this person. He is a Chairman, a well-respected man in our country and he is waiting for the sake of an ordinary employee." Then I saw Murthy and I rushed out. JRD called and said, "Young lady, tell your husband never to make his wife wait again."  In 1982, I had to resign from my job at Telco. I was reluctant to go, but I really did not have a choice. I was coming down the steps of Bombay House after wrapping up my final settlement when I saw JRD coming up. He was absorbed in thought. I wanted to say goodbye to him, so I stopped. He saw me and paused. Gently, he said, "So what are you doing, Mrs Kulkarni?" (That was the way he always addressed me.) "Sir, I am leaving Telco." "Where are you going?" he asked. "Pune, Sir. My husband is starting a company called Infosys and I'm shifting to Pune." "Oh! And what will you do when you are successful." "Sir, I don't know whether we will be successful." "Never start with diffidence," he advised me. "Always start with confidence. When you are successful you must give back to society. Society gives us so much; we must reciprocate. I wish you all the best." Then JRD continued walking up the stairs. I stood there for what seemed like a millennium. That was the last time I saw him alive. Many years later I met Ratan Tata in the same Bombay House, occupying the chair JRD once did. I told him of my many sweet memories of working with Telco. Later, he wrote to me, "It was nice hearing about Jeh from you. The sad part is that he's not alive to see you today."  I consider JRD a great man because, despite being an extremely busy person, he valued one postcard written by a young girl seeking justice. He must have received thousands of letters everyday. He could have thrown mine away, but he didn't do that. He respected the intentions of that unknown girl, who had neither influence nor money, and gave her an opportunity in his company. He did not merely give her a job; he changed her life and mindset forever. Close to 50 per cent of the students in today's engineering colleges are girls. And there are women on the shop floor in many industry segments. I see these changes and I think of JRD. If at all time stops and asks me what I want from life, I would say I wish JRD were alive today to see how the company we started has grown. He would have enjoyed it wholeheartedly.  My love and respect for the House of Tata remains undiminished by the passage of time. I always looked up to JRD. I saw him as a role model for his simplicity, his generosity, his kindness and the care he took of his employees. Those blue eyes always reminded me of the sky; they had the same vastness and magnificence."
