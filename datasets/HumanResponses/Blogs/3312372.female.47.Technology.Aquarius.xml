      Well I'm still to tired to say a lot. I'm happy it is one day closer to my favorite day Friday (Yeah!!!) Work was fun today no JACHO inspectors yet. All the paranoia for nothing. I received a wonderful card and letter form my son in prison today brought tears to my eyes and warmed my heart. Just as I finish reading his card and letter my daughter(Yes I have a 26 year old daughter also)called and wanted to stop by and drop off a book for her little brother. She and I have one of those love/hate mother daughter relationship unfortunately. I really love her and wish we could get along but she thinks she's the mother and I'm the child. Her father was German-Jew and sometimes I wonder if she resents my being black. I know it sounds weird but remember the movie Imitation of Life. I hope one day her and I can have a better relationship but I'm not going to drive myself crazy worrying about it. I know I did my best I could raising them all. I was a single parent. They had everything love, material things etc. As I looked at her today I tried to see myself in her. She is a very beautiful girl. I know she has my fight back mentality but she takes it to the extremes. In other words she can be quite a bitch. Which is not a bad thing but you must have discretion and tack. Well I guess I'll go get ready for Happy Friday and possibly my last day working half day :( But it's good I have a job that was supportive of me for seven months and was/is willing to work with me through my knee surgery and recovery. Well Pre Happy Friday !!! Peace :)

      Well I had a long hard day today between work and grocery shopping. Also mentally exhausted from this realationship thing. I appreciate my guy ??? picking up my son for me everyday from school so I don't have to deal with parking issues. Seeing him everyday and not knowing what to say to him is really wearing me out. I guess if the doctor does put me back to work full time next week. The bright side would be I would not have an excuse not to pick my son up from school since his school is on the way home. The whole situation is just so awkward. I'm to tired to elaborate further tonight. I even have a headache which is a rare thing for me. I must go lay down and relax so I will be bright eyed and bushy tailed tomorrow. Peace :)

      Well had a fun morning at work. Everyone's freaking out about JACHO committee coming to check out our hospital. I only work four hour's a day due to my recent surgery so I was glad to get out of there today. I had a lot of laughs this morning though before I left. I wish the work day was always four hours. I hope my doctor let's me have a few more weeks on limited duty because it is still hard for me to work past five hour's. Well what will be will be. I just don't want to end up a cripple standing on my feet all day before I'm ready. Well just did the bills when I got home. Watched my HBO shows and printed some 8x10's and wrote a letter to my grown son who is unfortunately incarcerated. He has been away since he was 14 for a robbery in which no one was injured. He is 21 now with seven more years to go. This was his first offense. Before this he had started to run away from home. If he would have committed a murder he would have been out sooner. Go figure. But anyhow he's not bitter he looks at it as a blessing because he could have been killed at least he alive. Where there's life there's hope and a second chance. It's just to bad the justice system is not a fair one. If I would have had a pricey lawyer I'm sure he would have been home in a couple of year's if that. I miss him... My guy called again not much to say as usual I don't know what he wants. Our relationship as of late is he picks my little son up from school and than goes wherever he goes when he leaves. But anyhow must get ready for another one of God's days. Peace :)

      Well another weekend has come to a quick end unfortunately :( It was a nice weekend no feeling sick. No Rum and Coke. I'm still having control over that still thank God. Just had a couple of beers. Less calories :) I stuck to my exercise program also. So I feel pretty good about myself and my new goals to cut the drinking down and to get the pain meds down also. I'm on the road to getting my body back in Hawaii shape!!! I gained about 10-15 pounds after the knee surgery I recently had. I don't look bad I just want to get back to my wardrobe and feel healthier. Well hopefully this will be a good week and I stay focused on my goals. My guy called still just small talk. Oh well I guess that's better than fighting. Nice weekend all and all just to short. Peace :)

      Well I had a nice day today !!! I usually hate company :( Today my girlfriend Ofy and a friend from work Shiho came over to visit. Ofy brought her three children over to play with my little boy. They brought me beautiful belated Mothers Day cards and a really nice mask(I collect them.) We all had a great time. It was fun to share some laughs with friends. The children had a good time also. Ofy actually has two children. She recently has taken on the respousiability of taking care of her husband's sister child. She didn't want to elaborate on it today. I guess when she's ready she will tell me what's going on. I hope Shiho had a good time it was her first time visiting my home. She's a really nice little Japanese girl. Well my boyfriend ??? did'nt call today but he sent an E-mail. It sure would be nice if he could open up and talk about our complicated relationship. Well it is very late and I have to get ready for manic Monday tomorrow since I was lazy and just enjoyed myself today.                   Peace :)

      Well the week is over thank god !!! I have one more week of working half days. I had knee surgery in December. So I'm on the mend but not ready to work eight hours yet. I hope my doctor feels the same way when I see him on the 24th. Well I don't want to be to boring just venting. I'm having a rather boring evening. My boyfriend of seven years and I are finally seem to be coming to and end. We don't have anything to say to each other anymore. So he left early and here I sit. I've tried to love him all these years in hopes he would love me back the same. But unfortunately that dosen't seem to be something that will ever happen. So I'm exhausted trying to make the realationship work. So I guess we're fading away. Oh well life goes on. Thank god I can take care of my self :)
