      I wonder, sometimes, how it is that the people who answer those polls are so stupid and gullible.  For example, the 60% of people who believe that Saddam Hussein was involved with 9/11.  Then I realized that they don't have to be stupid or gullible, they simply have the wrong filters.  We are all exposed to the same news, we all simply filter it in different ways.  In short, we are all susceptible to different types of news.  For example, Suzy Granola might be very skeptical about the claims of the Nuclear Public Relations group's ads--the one's where they claim that they don't pollute the air.  She might point out that the do, however, pollute the water and the ground and produce nasty nuclear waste.  On the other hand, she might be very susceptible to claims that shampoos that contain sodium lauryl sulfate are linked to laughing sickness.  Bob Wallstreet, on the other hand would scoff at the shampoo story, but might believe that his SUV is the safest car on the road without examining data to back it up.  In short we are all telling ourselves a story about ourselves and we don't closely examine details that fit in with our plot.  This is the greatest failure of science education and scientists in America.  Science has always sold itself as a story rather than as a process.  Progress has always been described as a destination rather than an opening of new avenues.  Research has always been presented as what we know rather than how we found out.  Scientists have always represented themselves as Prometheus stealing fire from the Gods, rather than children picking the daisies that they find in their path.  It is this failing that makes us vulnerable to stories, to narratives.  That which is internally consistent and corresponds with our predispositions is as good as the truth in our own minds.  This lack of scrutiny leads us down a many and varied path that goes one place--extremism.  Extremism is the destination of all minds that lose track of reality, and become ensnared in the lies that we tell ourselves.  It is the result of denying all valid arguments that contradict one's prejudices.  It is the insistence that one's own story is the most important.  I won't go into a lengthy list of all the facets of extremism, but I will allow you to consider the irrational behavior of people who consider themselves the following: vegans, creationists, macrobioticists, futurists, atheists, right to lifers, militant pro coicers, religious terrorists, animal rights nuts, militant homosexuals, family values Republicans, gun nuts, anti-gun nuts, dead-heads, oil executives, Irish, Israeli, Palestinian, Mac Users, Linux Users, 12 steppers, etc.  Is there a remedy?  Not a very practical one, but I would say a contributing factor of this type of behavior is that modern life is in real-time.  People don't have time to reflect, they don't read.  Stimulus demands a response before there is time to make an informed decision; and once a response is made then then the person is committed.  In an effort to be consistent, in order to move the plot forward, details that support the orginal response are internalised and those that are inconsistent are resisted.  One remedy would be to read more and think more.  Books are not real time, they are a dialogue between author and reader.  One can move back and forth within the text.  Study.  Challenge.  Another contributing factor is that people are cosseted; they don't have much contact with reality except through their TV's.  The TV news is not much help as they are all about the narrative, all about the story.  Newspapers are better, but people don't have time to read them.  They tend to work at jobs where they are further insulated from reality, the stories exchanged at the "water cooler" are taken as fact...they become the new mythology.  I wonder if the Age of Reason has given way to a new Dark Age where truth is buried under a dust-heap of myth, supposition, falsehood and belief.

      It is very unpleasant to spend the middle of the night in the pediatric ward of the emergency room.  I should say to begin with that everyone is ok, but the experience is most unpleasant.  I feel guilty for all the firecrackers, bb-guns, assaults and plummets of my own childhood.  I realize the cause of aging, and why parents have a characteristic that allows them to be recognized from a distance.    I will say again, that everyone is ok.  The designer of the cat-scan did not anticipate the needs of parents or 10 month-old infants.  The device consists of an aluminum trough that is covered with a sheet and slides along a rail where the patient lies.  At one end is a gigantic steel donut that is plastered all over with warning labels in various languages.  In the center of the donut is an x-ray camera that follows a track set in to the inner surface of the device.  It makes a whooshing noise as it goes and there are several flasing lights on it's surface.  The trough is designed for a 7 foot 400 pound man so positioning a 10 month old is something of a challenge; particularly with all the screaming, thrashing and crying.  The nurse brings out a device that looks like a small surfboard that has a vest glued to it's top surface.  It is one size fits all and adjustments for the baby are accomplished by wrapping him in enough layers of blankets so the vest fits snugly--at least he is rendered immobile and the tips of his hands protrude through the arm-holes.  All of this takes approximately 3 days.  Meanwhile only one parent is allowed in the room, so one parent has to wait outside while listening to the crying and not knowing what is going on.  Being outside is like something from Abu Ghraib.  The test was merely the highpoint of the evening.  A few grace notes:  The 3 hour wait at the doctor's office prior to going to the hospital.  Overhearing the triage nurse getting chewed out for ignoring a head trauma.  Trying to get the baby to sleep in 3 separate waiting rooms only to have him wakened for temperature and blood pressure tests whenever the feat was accomplished.  Having to squat like a catcher for extended periods to position my son for breast feeding since no provision was made for breast feeding in the pediatric ward of the doctor's office or the hospital.  Getting contradictory instructions from hospital staff.  Long periods of anxiety.  I learned a couple of things: While I can act cool, speak low and slow and generally seem to be the one who can keep his head when everyone around me is losing theirs, in the midst of a crisis I can't handle a pen--the hospital admittance documents look like they were filled in during an earthquake.  Likewise, I realized that as I was holding my son for nursing and as my wife sort of collapsed on my shoulder that it was no longer sufficient to pretend to be grown-up; that people were depending on me in a really scary and real way.  I learned that a bump to the head of a baby learning to crawl is generally not considered very serious at the doctor's office, vomiting that starts the next day is taken pretty seriously indeed.  It turns out to be a coincident strike of indigestion, but it made for a memorable week-end.  The cause of all this is still storming around on all fours, fearless, inquisitive and independent.  I've never been more scared.

       urlLink A link  (you must register)   Sometimes I wonder who all these promiscuous people are and other times I confront the fact that they are people who are all around me.  Something about me leaves me out of these types of games, and other times my very neutrality causes people to tell me details about  their lives.  Presumably these people find each other somehow, the girl mentioned in the above link that had sex for money while working at her government job; she must've signalled her availability to this type of activity somehow.  I can't imagine men propositioning women in the office with a line like, "Hey baby I'll give you $200 if you sleep with me."  Apparently it does happen but the communication is happening on a plane I'm not even aware of.

      I've been examining the risk of terrorist attack.  There have been 3 notable successful terrorist strikes on the US since 1990.  WTC bombing in 1993, OK City in 1995 and 9/11 in 2001.  The losses of life at each of these attacks were 6, 168 and 2819.  Please note, in this analysis I will be looking at these numbers very objectively, this is not meant to trivialize the deaths of these people or the loss of their families.  In addition to these three attacks there has been the anthrax attacks at congressional office buildings and news organizations, a series of mailbox bombings in the Midwest, a foiled attack during the Clinton administration when terrorists attempted to smuggle explosives across the Canadian border, and numerous police and federal investigations that seem to be caused by a level of hysteria. These events resulted in little direct loss of life, there were a couple of deaths from the use of Cipro and a pilot that flew into a building with his Cessna was killed, I am not aware of further casualties  I have no knowledge of the effect of security, the number of attacks that are foiled, the effects of continued unrest in Palestine, etc. but attacks over a 14 year period seem to have a frequency of 1 attack each 3-5 years. It seems that a safe worst case scenario would be two successful attacks a year and a best case scenario of one successful attack for each ten years.  Likewise, the best case for a terrorist attack would result in a minimum loss of life.  The worst case is unpleasant, the atomic bomb over Hiroshima killed 70,000 people and the one over Nagasaki killed 40,000.  Due to the improved construction of buildings, as evidenced by the low loss of life in the US from natural disasters in comparison to densely populated areas in other countries, 70,000 deaths seems to be a safe cap for the worst case. However since these attacks tend to deplete their available targets the attacks that result in the best case are much more likely than those that would result in the worst case.  Let's assume a worst-case median of 2500 people for each successful attack; anyone who has visited the WTC or even studied pictures knows how terrible that median is.  But here's my point, using a worst case median of 2500 casualties (which is roughly equivalent to the bloodiest attack on American soil) and a worst case of 2 successful attacks each year, and ignoring the fact that the US would run out of World Trade Centers and Super Bowls at such a profligate rate of attrition:  The result would be 5000 deaths each year.  In 2002 there were 43,000 deaths from car accidents.  There were more than 17,000 deaths in 2002 from alcohol related accidents alone.    Any loss of life is a tragedy and there are no easy answers when it comes to dealing with terrorists.  This is something I am sure of however,   if you assume that there will be two 9/11 type attacks that succeed every year, you are still eight times as likely to die in a car accident as you are to be killed by a terrorist.  .  I notice that the administration regularly manipulates the color coded terrorist alert system to maintain a maximum level of hysteria.  Given the fruits of my research I would like to give my own color coded alerts.  Red level warning that some SUV will run over your ass.  Red level warning that someone from the government will lie to you today.  Red level warning that this administration will return to office  Red level warning that someone in power doesn't like you having the rights that you have left.  Red level warning that someone will send me a pissy e-mail about this and call me partisan.  Green-level warning that someone will be able to refute the basic truth of this post.     Incidentally, in the course of my research I learned the following: many scholars estimate that 15,000 to 20,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the first Gulf War.  According to the CBC between 9,100 and 11,000 Iraqis were killed so far in this Gulf War.

      Ethics is a term that is commonly used to describe behavior that is good.  But behavior can vary wildly and still be ethical.  For example Bob and and Al are each given a time machine.  Al chooses to go back in time and kill Hitler in 1933.  Bob destroys his time machine for fear of unintended consequences and that it might fall into the wrong hands.  Here, 2 ethical behaviors lead to diverging paths.  I contend that ethics is not a given set of behaviors that are considered good.  Rather they are any behavior that is performed with good reason.  In other words the root of ethics is rational thought rather than beneficence. And there are a wide range of behaviors that are considered ethical.  Furthermore, in my experience, the regard that people are held in has little to do with their actual behavior.  Rather it is the perception of that behavior, or more specifically the motivation attributed to that behavior that is the deciding factor.    While it is certainly advantageous to the individual to increase their options for behaviors by rationalizing their own chosen behaviors as ethical.  I wonder at the advantage of rationalizing other people's behaviors as friendly.  The psychology of this is very interesting, and I'm not sure the advantage of it, but it exists.  Marion Berry was the beneficiary of this type of behavior, as was Rush Limbaugh, Bill Clinton, etc.  Once a commitment is made to a person then any flaws will be looked at in the most positive light.  Enter The Big Lie.  Public figures use this predisposition to be believed cynically to advance their own ends.  When confronted with facts that are uncomfortable these figures simply discredit the messenger.  Likewise, they repeat lies often enough until people and start to believe them.  For example, members of the Bush administration repeated the lie about WMD and the link between Hussein and terrorism so often that there are still people who believe them.  People are susceptable to this because they believe themselves to be rational, but they are merely reasonable.  People arrive at notions by reason, and then ignore any evidence that challenges those notions.  This is not new, observe the following quote from Blaise Pascal:  [81] [...] This arrogant faculty [Imagination], the enemy of reason [...] cannot make fools wise, but she makes them happy, to the great regret of reason, who can only make her friends miserable [...] He who would follow reason alone would be a proven fool [...] We have another source of error, in the shape of sickness. It impairs both the judgment and the senses [...] Further, self-interest is a wonderful instrument for neatly putting out our eyes [...] Justice and truth are two points so fine that our instruments are too blunt to rest on them exactly. If we succeed in bringing them to bear, they crush the point and press on the surrounding area, on the false rather than the true. Man is so happily formed that he has no reliable [source] of truth, but several excellent sources of falsehood. [...] But the most ridiculous cause of his errors is the conflict between sense [i.e. the senses] and reason. [82] [...] Nothing shows [Man] the truth. Everything misleads him; those two sources of truth, reason and the senses, not only lack sincerity, but deceive one another in turn. [...] Reason and the senses are rivals in the practice of falsehood and deception.   There was a time that prophets proved to be false were summarily executed, by stoning.  Now we don't even bother to throw the liars out of office.  We've become a nation of the blind, misled by reason.

      I think that my job has changed my use of language.  Since I started this blog I've looked back at the last time that I kept a diary, about 10 years ago when I was in the Peace Corps.  I've found that my current writing style lacks some of the vitality of my previous attempts.  More subdued, more restrained, bigger words.  I assume that the same patterns now exist in my spoken language.  Understatement and use of long words are useful in the classroom, if only because people need to puzzle through my baroque sentences they tend to start thinking before they have a chance to get mad.  Also any emotional loading in words tend to lead my kids into some non-constructive mind-sets.  The main cause of this diffidence, however, is that I can't talk about my job.  On the one hand confidentiality rules prevent the release of any specific information about children.  On the other hand  the parts of my job that I can talk about are so outside most people's experience that when I do bring things up it's like I'm speaking in asterisks and ampersands.  I've met people in similar positions who deal with them in different ways.  One guy talks about the most extreme things he's seen in an attempt to shock people.  Others joke about the kids.  I've found that I have less and less to say, about anything.  Even the weather and football seem beyond me.  The only words left seem to be about what I teach and the scripts that I use when I talk to the kids.  The nice thing about these blogs is that words are all there are, I'm hoping I can find some more words.

      Assuming that users are trolling in blogspot.com; while using the whole internet results in a larger number of users it also results in a much worse probability.  The best odds result from focusing on people who are searching in the http://______________.blogspot.com/ format.  If we assume that most people will choose blog addresses that number from 5-15 characters then the odds that any one user will find this blog are:  (1/((26!/21!)+(26!/20!)+(26!/19!)+(26!/18!)+(26!/17!)+(26!/16!)+(26!/15!)+(26!/14!)+(26!/13!)+(26!/12!)+(26!/11!)))  Therefore the raw odds of anyone finding this blog are: (Number of users)*(Avg. number of blogs visited)*(1/((26!/21!)+(26!/20!)+(26!/19!)+(26!/18!)+(26!/17!)+(26!/16!)+(26!/15!)+(26!/14!)+(26!/13!)+(26!/12!)+(26!/11!)))  But, blogs will attract viewers in direct proportion to their current popularity.  I would estimate that any blog not already in the top 10% of popularity are have a finding probability that is best approximated by the square of the value that is listed above.  Therefore the final probablity is: ((Number of users)*(Avg. number of blogs visited)*(1/((26!/21!)+(26!/20!)+(26!/19!)+(26!/18!)+(26!/17!)+(26!/16!)+(26!/15!)+(26!/14!)+(26!/13!)+(26!/12!)+(26!/11!))))^2

       "So for example, back before CSL, in those old things called high schools, mostly they needed people to move paper around and kiss each other's butts, so they taught some kids to make blah-blah noises like administrators.  They also needed kids who were going to do actual work, but they had too many of those, so they kept the rest of the kids locked up to keep them off the labor market.  They taught the first group to make vague noises about any topic that came up, just like the noises in the media, and that was what knowledge was; and they taught the ones they were warehousing that learning anything was for snots.  And they got just what they needed, a bottom group that never learned anything (because they had been taught that they didn't want to), and a top group that never learned anything (because they thought the blah-blah noises were all there was to know). It even reinforced, because the tops thought the bottoms because the bottoms didn't make blah-blah noises, and the bottoms thought they didn't like learning because they didn't like blah-blah noises.  It worked just fine for pretty nearly everyone."  "And  that's  what were going back to?"...  "Naw, it was just an example of the way every society always makes the kids that it needs.  Up until about 2000, they just didn't need anybody very smart or capable--what they needed was people to buy stuff and follow rules."   Sort of an attractive theory in some ways as it excuses the general dissipation that is creeping over our society as the demand of our culture.  I think it breaks down though when one applies it to other examples of youth in the world. For example, 10-14 year old boys and girls "schooled" as soldiers and carrying guns and used as slaves by strong-men in Africa; it's hard to imagine any society needing children schooled in such a way.    It's better, I think, to picture societies as chaotic systems.  Stable societies find metastable states that are sustainable over the short-term.  Most societies never achieve a metastable state and die of a sort of "heat death" before ever getting started. Furthermore, stable societies can achieve unstable states when they veer off in directions where there is no feedback to prevent the loss of stability.    In the example above of central African nations that are overcome with revolutions and counter-revolutions, or the Dark Ages in Europe, or the period of the warlords in China in the last days of the emperor, or any extended period of chaos when a stable societies never take root.  In these "societies" the actions of individuals never resolve themselves into any apparent organization.  The closest symbolic approximation I can think of this kind of society is water vapor in a cloud.  Organization tends to be extremely localized unless some pressure is applied to the system from the outside, or some fundamental change occurs in the way particles react with one another on the inside.  In our own society, we are drifting away from an ethic of accomplishing and towards an ethic of acquiring.  The reason for this is that our economy has become so complex that it is impossible for most people to trace how their job (their function in society) contributes to their own survival or the advancement of society as a whole.  So instead of measuring success with accomplishment, which is harder and harder to perceive as things get more complex, we use tokens to measure success.  In short we need to acquire things to demonstrate productivity.  And since accomplishment becomes something of an after-thought, the traits that are associated with accomplishment become less important.  Instead people seek skill sets that allow them to match their possessions to those of others in their peer group.

      In 1994, my second year of teaching, I was writing an assignment for a graduate course; I said, "Psychoactive drugs, such as Prozac, are immoral; like attaching strings to a dead body and having it walk around.  They are merely a quick-fix to make the body behave without healing the soul.  It is dangerous to play with sorrow, desperation, remorse and rage.  Perhaps they are not symptoms of one person's sickness but an illness of society as a whole."  Very dramatic.  My opinion has evolved somewhat in the interim.  I've come to the conclusion that behavior is largely habit and routine.  Medication can be useful if it helps to break bad habits and  aids in establishing good habits.  On the other hand if there is no effort to change a habit then the meds are about useless.  In the classroom, it seems that established routines are more important for moderating behavior than anything else, even on days when kids forget, or run out of their meds.    Whether or not meds are useful, I still have concerns about their morality.  Specifically, their use as a substitute for good parenting. I don't blame parents for disability and I know that good parents can have troubled kids and I freely admit that MY students are getting what they need to function when they take their meds.  It is also true that these type of drugs are over-used without a clear idea of the health risks to compensate for poor decisions by parents.  For example, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a study linking TV viewing by infants to increased risk for ADHD.  Each hour a day of TV watched by children below the age of 2 results in roughly a 10% increase in the risk of ADHD.  DVD's and TV shows for infants are becoming easier to find and there is anecdotal evidence of infants having TV's in their room.    It seems to me that kids don't have enough boredom in their lives.  When I was a child I didn't have anything to do but read on a rainy day, and when the weather was nice I was outside playing.  I would like to be able to offer the same thing to my own son (9 months old), but I don't even know if it's possible anymore.  I suppose that I don't have any better ideas about dealing with sorrow, desperation, remorse and rage except to provide a slate of constructive antagonists.

      Did you ever notice that whoever stands next to Bush in a photo-op gets screwed by the administration?   About ten times in the last year Bush has visited a program for a photo-op just before the administration cut funding for the program.  The most famous case was when he cut Job Corps right after a speech praising the program.  What's even funnier are the press conferences announcing the next round of tax cuts or the next initiative, always posed on the stage are people who will NEVER receive any benefits from the announced legislation.  One time his staff couldn't track down construction workers before a shoot so they passed out hard hats to lobbyists.  Not very often that you see construction workers in Armani suits...  Well, you may be wondering where all this is leading;  I can't help but remember the press conference leading up to the war with the prime ministers of Spain and England.  After 2 years of war the Spanish government has been replaced, Blair is in deep doo-doo; and while Hussein is in US custody, the US government is restoring Baathists to their government positions.  I also remember Chalabi appearing with Bush at a State of the Union address, and now US troops are searching his house for evidence.  It occurs to me that we might save a lot of lives and money by simply having Bush do photo-ops with anybody we want to get rid of.

      One wonders if it is necessary to choose a side.  Since we have the capacity to believe contradictory things then perhaps that is the healthiest thing to do.  For example, I can like a kid and still recognize that he is a dangerous sociopath.  As a result I can interact with him in a productive way while at work and establish a rapport that makes my job possible; at the same time I expect that every other thing the kid says is a lie, am careful never to be in a room with him without witnesses, and am extremely careful about monitoring his behavior and the environment.    On a grander scale as a Christian, well at least as a Presbyterian, I believe in God, but at the same time and in some ways I recognize that it is important also not to believe in God.  Christianity and a belief in God give me a spiritual depth.  I am encouraged to be humble in my successes and upfront about my shortcomings.  I am sustained in the face of a job that uses people up.  A belief in a divine plan that I am part of is helpful in preventing dithering while confronting stressful situations.  The presence of God in the world saves me from the despair that comes from the amount of NEED in the world that must go unfulfilled; certainly I lack the capacity in my own person to satisfy the level of need that I confront daily.  In prayer, I have a way to offer something to children that I can't reach or help in any other way.  In short, it is important for my continued function that I see myself as a paladin, a sword in the hand of God.  On the other hand, as a rational being I recognize that this is all a little crazy.  I resent the smugness that is the result of too much faith in any narrow belief.  I mistrust any person, especially myself, who seems sure of the mind of God.  I am offended by faith that is overly public and overly demonstrative.  I am dismayed that individual misfortune is attributed to moral turpitude.  I am disgusted by proselytizing, as there is nothing more arrogant than recording over other people's truth with your own.  Most offensive is the lack of doubt, the shrill certainty that there is one and only one way.  I suppose that I am a hypocrite, but I don't feel false when I pray or dialogue with God. Furthermore, the split vision seems helpful to me as I work with kids.  Simultaneously I can view the disabilities clinically and religiously; in one sense I recognize the chemical or structural difference of the brain that is the physical cause of the disability, but it is also helpful to think of the demon that the children are struggling with that is the spiritual manifestation of the child's disability.  Organic disability contains within it the idea of permanence and the necessity of acceptance, struggle with a demon contains within it the possibility of victory.  Likewise it is helpful to attribute the most egregious lapses of behavior to an outside agency rather than to the afflicted child.  On the other hand a medical view removes any stigma from a disability and suggests avenues of research that lead to palliatives and conceivably cures.  In short, I wonder if we are not meant to be two things jammed together.  Our physical being makes us of 2 minds, and severing the corpus collosum results in us being two people in the same skin.  It seems uniquely human to be a thing and it's opposite.  Humans are the only thing in the world that have an existence separate from the role they play in the physical universe.  Perhaps that dual nature of humanity requires us to be all things and it is unhealthy to deny one aspect of the self.  I seem to have talked my way around to a very old eastern idea which I never saw myself approaching when I started this discussion.  Since others who are more knowledgeable have talked about this at length I think I will exit here.  It is curious however that eastern medicines approach sickness with the sort of dual ideas that I mentioned above.

      Why should we expect that giving automatic weapons to 19 and 20 year old kids and sending them 3000 miles from home would result in good decision-making?  Kids don't have the sense to moderate their own behavior anymore and require a grown-up to do it for them.  Since there seems to be a lack of grown-ups involved with the Iraq expedition it doesn't seem very surprising.  It's amazing what kids can get up to in a school when they escape direct supervision, it's no surprise what they do as part of an occupation force half a world away in the same circumstances.  Half the problems with the world seems to be that there aren't enough grown-ups or people who want to be grown-ups.  Too many people want to be kids forever.  The result is absentee fathers, skipped child support, runaway debt, SUV's, the election of politicians who refuse to tell the truth or face unpleasant truths, silly law suits, runaway malpractice insurance, oldsters dressing like youngsters, etc., etc., blah, blah, blah, ad infinitum.

      It seems to me that truth isn't real in the sense that it impacts the behavior of people anymore.  So long as the untruth is palatable or advantageous then people are perfectly willing to act as though it is true.    The State Board of Education is currently visiting the school where I work.  The subject of the investigation is a former student of mine who was also on my case-load.  Since the complaint is largely about events that occurred before I began work at the school, and/or before the student was added to my case-load, I feel somewhat impartial about the whole proceeding.  This is the first time I've experienced this sort of thing and it is quite interesting.  I can't divulge details, or even really talk about it to people who know me due to confidentiality rules.  What is interesting about this process is that neither side is really interested in the truth.    The interview by the state investigator included current staff of the school, most of us were not present at the meetings being investigated.  We were asked to establish a narrative of how the school did what it was supposed to do that was consistent with the documentary evidence.  The narrative that we established might have been the truth, but we really couldn't know if it was the truth.  The investigator seemed very conscientous, and I'm sure he followed up where possible to find people who were still working for the state, but the case will be argued largely on the conclusions that we reached.  And while the conclusions were reasonable and arrived at in good-faith, we have no real assurance that our interpretation was true.  The complaint, meanwhile, was doing the same thing.  It was basically it was a laundry list of about a dozen things that seemed to be formulated by a parsing of state regulations.  It was a basically a different story told with the idea that this child was being denied their FAPE.   This sort of process seems, to me, like a symptom of an illness in our society.  While this is sort of an extreme example I confront these sorts of dilemmas every day.  The evidence that we use to establish who should get services, and the level of service, is not medical, it's circumstantial.  In a sense we are trying various stories onto these children in order to find a match.  Meanwhile parents and the kids themselves are spinning their own stories.  The result seems, often, to be castles in the air.  And when the castles come tumbling down the result seems to be a deep resentment against the "system."  Since many of these decisions are driven by the parents own desires it can make things very uncomfortable.  IDEA is a law, written by people who are not professional educators, that gives the bulk of power to make hard educational decisions to people who are not professional educators.  While I am generally in favor of giving a voice to stakeholders, should people who are not trained be the ones who are directing these decisions.  It just seems to be a further devaluation of the status of educators as professionals.

      The recent memo from the US Justice Department giving the OK to the White House to torture has far reaching implications.  According to Michael Glennon, a war law expert at Tufts University, "It is an extraordinary claim. It is as broad an assertion of presidential authority as I have ever seen.  This is a claim of unlimited executive power."  > As a people we are losing the will to govern ourselves when this type of thing goes unchallenged.  This, by itself and alone should be enough to throw this group of outlaws out of office.  As a people we can no longer sit on our asses and expect some other damn person to make things run right.  Not only are they not doing the job we expected them to do, they are picking our pocket in the meantime.  This group of jokers are not doing the job, picking our pocket and sizing up the opportunity to stay on permanantly.    urlLink    Legal?  And if it's only a small group of psychopaths why were there so many pictures, hundreds or possibly thousands, and why won't they release the pictures; the following is from a CNN transcript:  BLITZER: All right. Ben Wedeman reporting from Baghdad.   Thanks, Ben, very much. Let's continue our conversation with two influential members of the United States Congress: Democratic Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter of California. He's the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.  We heard, Mr. Chairman, the secretary of defense say there are a lot more pictures, hundreds more pictures, maybe a thousand more pictures, and that there are videotape as well.  A, have you seen any of these pictures or this new videotape?  HUNTER: No, I haven't seen it, and I think that's an important point, because it has also come out -- and came out in our hearing -- that the secretary did not see any pictures until just a few days ago.   When we started this investigation, January 13th, or January 16th, we announced to the world we were doing the investigation, but those pictures, the pictures we had, became part of the criminal files, and as we walk down through the court-martial procedure, they stayed in the files.  BLITZER: Do you want to see these? Should the Congress be shown the videotapes and the pictures?  HUNTER: You know, I think after the while these pictures, if they're replications of what we've seen so far, most of them with the same soldiers, at least the ones that I've seen, I don't know if they give any value added to this.  The key is, the number of people involved. If the number of people stays at six or even goes a little bit above that but doesn't turn into the vast conspiracy that some people have talked about, that's the important thing, not the number of pictures.  BLITZER: So you're saying they shouldn't be released to Congress, and they certainly shouldn't be made public, is that what you're saying?  HUNTER: No, I would say they should be put in the Armed Services vaults for any member of Congress to come take a look at, but I don't think they add anything if they're really bad pictures to put them on the world...   urlLink link

      A  urlLink link .  What bothers me about this guy is that he seemed to start out as a regular person and he gradually changed into a monster.  I know that our prison system is deeply flawed, but I never realized how it corrupts everybody that comes in contact with it.  I can't think of what turned this guy into a sadistic psychopath except what he did in his job as a prison guard.  I've noticed at school that many teachers are as bad as the students;  I wonder how I've changed in ways that I don't even perceive.  A large percentage of my kids suffer from emotional disabilities and emotional overlay, with another sizable percentage that are involved with the legal system, with some overlap.  I wonder what they are teaching me while I am teaching them.  It's disturbing to me that I might not realize the effect my job has on me.

       urlLink "In the Loop"  6/4/2004  The article on how the RNC was outsourcing it's calls to India has been removed from the Hindustan Times, fortunately it is cached on  urlLink Google   I certainly don't see why the Hindustan Times would lie, but I see every reason the RNC would lie.    The most interesting thing in this article is how the RNC big attack guns were brought out to attack this congresswoman who won a by-election.  Based on her two days in office and single vote she has suddenly become the next Hanoi Jane.  Cute.

       A  urlLink link .  While this is an interesting idea I think there are some big holes in it.    1.  The tax will be regressive and affect poor people the most.  Likewise it will cause a big increase in the price of things like food due to the cost of transportation.  2.  Many home-owners will end up having to rent.  People who live in the far suburbs won't be able to sell their house for enough money to move into the suddenly more valuable houses near their jobs.  3.  It will tighten the job market since people will be less willing to commute.  This could cause inflation as salaries are boosted.  4.  There is not a sufficient transportation infrastructure without the extensive use of cars and trucks...the economy would have severe dislocations.  5.  It is stupid to buy out idiots from their SUV's when there will be a lot bigger problems as a result of this policy.

      I  can't spell it, but I can make it.  This must be a good batch because my wife asked if I wanted to take some Altoids to work tomorrow when I kissed her good-night.  Pour 3 cups of boiling water over 1.5 cups of Bulgur Wheat.  Allow to sit for at least 30 mins.  While waiting mince/food process the following.  3 cloves of garlic 2 shallots The white ends and the first inch of green of about 12 Welsh onions or an equivilent amount of cleaned leeks. 1/4 tsp rosemary 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper 1/2-3/4 tsp allspice 1 tsp salt dash of whatever leafy spices are around (thyme, basil, marjorem, sage, dill, etc,) dash of cumin 1/2 cup good olive oil 1/2 cup lemon juice.  Chop finely the following 3 bunches of curly parsley 2 bunches of mint 12 more Welsh Onions 8-12 oz of Feta cheese  Sautee a handful of raw pine nuts until a nice dark brown in olive oil.  Once the Bulgur Wheat has cooled drain any remaining liquid and toss with spice lemon oil puree.  Continue to toss with handfulls of the chopped parsley mint and onions.  Add cheese and pine nuts.  With lots of veggies you may want to add a little more oil and salt.  Should have a sticky consistency without being too dense.  Serve at a little below room temperature, although letting it sit in the fridge overnight can be a good idea.  Great with any BBQ.

      Here is a  urlLink link .   It's interesting that an organization that is considered one of the most liberal, and is staffed by the usual group of lefty suspects, should fall into line with the message ofthe White House.  In this column by the ombudsman of the Washington Post, Mr. Gestler points out how interesting it is.  The idea of liberal bias is ridiculous when the modern media is so beholden to people who are in power to provide all that is reported.  Reporters have very little power to find things out and are very susceptible to spin because everything is a secret and Freedom of Information Act requests are routinely ignored and delayed.  This type of thing really shows what a tempest in a teacup the Pew findings really are.  I should also point out that these are top-flight reporters who are being manipulated by the White House.  At one point the administration was bypassing print media for local TV news so they could avoid any sort of "filter" at all.  What hope does the average American have vs the slick operatives of the administration when so many are so gullible to believe in psychic hotlines and buy crap like the salad shooter.

      I know that I'm behind the curve on this, but I like to think about things before I drone on endlessly. First allow me to link to the actual Pew Survey that everyone is talking about:  urlLink The Real Thing   Let me also provide the following link:  urlLink Interesting exit data from the 2000 election courtesy of CNN.    There are three possible interpretations of the very controversial information that is revealed in the "Values and the Press" section of the Pew survey.  They are:  1.  Conservatives are black-listed by news organizations and they hire only progressives, liberals and homosexuals.  i.e. the conspiracy hypothesis.  2. Conservatives are naturally not interested in pursuing careers in journalism, that they have some characteristics that result in an antipathy for the profession.  i.e. the Monte Carlo hypothesis.  3.  People who work in the field of journalism are "converted" to liberalism and that some aspect of the profession influences the workers towards leftist thought.  i.e. the meme hypothesis.  I dismiss the conspiracy hypothesis the most easily.  For a conspiracy to exist there would have to be a high degree of articulation between competing entities, an incredible level of secrecy, and actions that are inconsistent with the long term goals of the companies that own the news agencies.  Since most news agencies are owned by big multinational corporations, it is irrational to favor employees that are hostile to multinationals over employees that would be sympathetic to the companies.  The Monte Carlo hypothesis is simple and attractive.  Journalists, for the most part, don't make much money.  According to the  CNN 2000 exit polls, conservatives tend to be more wealthy than liberals; ergo, they must tend to seek higher paying jobs.  Furthermore, jobs in the media are overwhelmingly restricted to urban areas; the CNN 2000 data shows an strong correlation between living in cities and liberal voting, while a similar correlation exists between rural living and conservative voting.  Thus, it is reasonable to assume that conservatives don't like to live in cities.  The combination of these two factors results in fewer conservatives entering the profession, and those that do are more likely to leave.   The meme hypothesis is also attractive although less simple.  Journalists constantly come in contact with information.  As part of their job they must spend as much time as news consumers as news reporters.  If you examine the CNN 2000 exit poll data there is an increase in liberal voting as voters get more education.  Unfortunately, the differences due to education in the poll are exceeded by the actual difference between liberals and conservatives in the news-room.  It would seem that the meme hypothesis doesn't hold water or at least the meme effects can't be due to education alone.   You will recall that I mentioned above that there was a strong correlation between urban dwelling and voting liberal.  You will also recall that almost all of reporting jobs are in big cities.  Therefore it might be that the meme effects are not due to the profession of journalism, but of residing in large cities.  It is reasonable for urrban dwellers to develop liberal philosophies because liberal priorities are in the best interest of city dwellers.  Therefore, it is reasonable to attribute some of the imbalance in the newsroom to the liberalising effects of city dwelling.  Probably, it is a combination of the Monte Carlo hypothesis and the meme hypothesis that is the cause of the Pew survey findings.  The question remains then, what can be done to correct this imbalance?  The simplest remedies would be to increase reporter salaries and to move news bureaus out to North Dakota.  This would probably result in a decrease in the quality of news because it would necessitate having fewer reporters working someplace where there was no news.  While this would not change most TV news, most newspapers would suffer.  Personally, I question whether the imbalance has any real effect.  I would be interested in seeing the break down politically of editorial boards and management.  Since these are the opinion making positions on the paper and the positions that evaluate news-worthiness, it is these positions that effect news content.  I would be surprised to see the same difference as was described for the regular reporters.  And I would be even more surprised if editorial content or tone were affected by the politics of the staff.  In the same way that your Rolls Royce or Mercedes or Lamborghini are put together by lefty pinko socialists, your Wall Street Journal, Washington Times and Fox News can be put together by hippie intellectuals.
