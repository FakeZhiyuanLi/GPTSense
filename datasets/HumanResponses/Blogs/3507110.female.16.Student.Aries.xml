      Things were darker than they used to be. The sky never seemed to be blue anymore and the trees just never as green. Debris lay everywhere in the yard, twisted images of branches defaced by a day's fierce wind. She stood behind the glass window of her door just watching the lightning and feeling the resonant thunder that followed. It shook her, deep inside her, it stirred something that made her want to scream, laugh, and cry at the same time. Nothing really had the power to do that anymore. She had become the walking dead, a slave to the oblivion that was sleep, preferring its safe recesses to the dangerous outside world. Things were darker than they used to be. The black clouds above her proved that. - 05/31/04  It's been raining in little old Mayberry for how many weeks. The pumps in our basement never relent and I'm quite accustomed to its bitching. Its got work to do. I think the sun might be out but I won't smile or hold my breath. The weather forecast hasn't been looking too grand for some time now. Best to just sigh and count your losses then begin counting your possible earnings. I suppose it can't rain all the time but 'm beginning to wonder if I should rush to Fleet Farm and start buying shit to build an Ark. I wouldn't be surprised either. Hell, If I were God I would have flooded us a long friggin time ago. Humans are assholes. Teenagers being the biggest percentage of that title. I realize that we're coming into our own and that self-expression is key but what's the point of expressing yourself if you're just going to be an untolerating, self-absorbed, selfish bitch about it!!?? Which, by the way, stands for most of my highschool. Oxymorons...

        You're Element is Night. You're a loner who is very creative but never show your work to anyone. You may smile a little but sadness or loneliness surround you and other can feel it when they're near you. You have a dark or unusual beauty that makes you mysterious and you probably have a lot of secrets that you've never told anyone. You're beauty is intriging and unorthidox but the real thing that makes you special is your eyes. Something in them makes them like Diamonds in the Rough.    urlLink   What's Your Element(girls)? (PICTURES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Most often, I draw the outline of the person first, the skeleton of their profile that are the basic strokes for their unique look. And then I paint the muscles and tissue around the plain bones, weaving the sinewy fibers together in ways that bring about the creation of flesh and beauty. And then I add the accessories, the eyes, the hair, the clothing. The exterior is always fun to draw, always fun to add a piece of me to them, but it's the story behind the eyes that really matters. It is the creation of a life, a personality that breathes excitement into the art.  My mind is empty at the moment. Like a hollow glass balloon. Last night, Saturday night...what a night. A rendevous meeting that left me in smiles. I thought that the trip to Jessie's was going to be a simple in and out mission, get the sweater, get home. But what I had not expected was to put my four wheeler into reverse and then see something black come racing around the corner of the house, something black and familiar. The moment I got off my seat, you had me in your arms and I melted into your embrace as much as I could. You told me that you missed me and I couldn't have been happier when you kissed me. But it was too short, I needed more, I wanted more. But I couldn't..Before I knew it, you were gone and the lonely stretch of pavement leading me back to the dungeons of the country house I call home was all that wrapped around me. And all at once, things I wanted to say to you come pouring into my head and I cursed myself for not saying them. I don't have very much time with you until the ocean of time seperates us, before the mist settles and I'm left waiting beside the mirror. I'm such a fool for clamming up and now, if I could go back, I would have kissed you and told you how much I loved you. Until then, I'll float on and hopefully survive my bouts of insanity.

      There's something in my head. It moves like water in a bathtub, sloshing against the sides and overflowing to soak the carpeting. When I lay down to sleep at night, it fizzes and bubbles like soda. Sometimes, I can feel it running out of my ears, and my eyes, and my nose, and my mouth onto the pillow but when I look down, there's nothing there. Only the vague memory of a liquid touch on my skin. A burning sensation that travels through the layers into my veins. Through my veins, it washes down the rivers of blood into my heart and then I can feel the fire smoking inside the chambers. At this time my eyes hurt and water with sleep and all I want to do is lie down and forget the world for once. Lonliness is a flame that can never be smote. It sits there and waits in the dark black coals and ashes until even the tiniest breeze whisks over the surface and kindles the beast below the shadows. Something in my heart always hurts, something is always burning, always hurting until I can't ignore it. There's always this feeling that my puzzle is missing a piece, a critical piece. I'm like a young child solving a riddle, given a puzzle by his parents. They tell them that his present is revealed to them through the puzzle and the one block that will show it all has not turned up in the box, or on the floor, or in the couch cushion. The missing link is indeed missing and I can't help but feel it through every fiber of my being. I keep telling myself that. It's missing, I tell myself. Better look for it. Better find it before you drive yourself insane from late nights and early morning, bitter sodas and apple sauce. The kind with the chunks so when I go to chew on the pulp, I remember that there's icebergs floating in the water. I just painted my nails black, the color of the sky, and already its chipping away. I pick at it as I write this nonsensical fairy poem, occasionally chewing on a nail or two and spitting the flakes of polish away, in the air, onto the carpet, onto the desk, onto my shirt. I don't care. Because in the end, no one ever notices their polish peeling and rushes to the garbage can. Shreds of nail polish are forever lost in the microscopic world we tread upon, like a lost soul trapped beneath a tombstone or locked inside a void so deep and so endless they are left with nothing and everything. I'm not well. I think I'm actually quite sick. But this sickness I will hide. This illness isn't right, it's the embodiment of insanity with phlegm and congestion. What's there to say? I'm missing so much of me, so much of you, it's hard to tell time now. The pendulum of the old roman numeral clock in the living room only swings when it wants to, only works when the air sounds right, when nothing is looking. It will rock back and forth in the dense smoke snakes that float upwards to meet the ceiling. And it will go about its business when no one but I can bear witness. That old clock is solemnly waiting something, waiting to begin its duty 24/7 only when something happens, only when its ready. Flowers leave in the winter but they return in the spring, they are born of the rain and of the clouds but also of the sun. They wait to begin life until they know they can. I'm waiting..for so many things..but mostly for you. Because that's all I can do is wait. I'm not a patient person but..love makes you do..some awfully crazy things. The next couple of days I'm going to try and smile and sing with the clouds and the birds for awhile. I'm going to run around in the meadows of the world with the ones who make me smile and laugh and forget about things and I'm going to hunt for butterflies with honey and those beautiful orchids lazily swaying at the end of the yard near the barns. But at night, when the sun is gone and the stars and moon roam the endless fields of life and death, I will think of you and your face will be what puts my tired eyes to sleep. Your words will make me dream and your touch will keep me awake until I can be in the company of my friends once more. And even then, the memory remains. There's a lot of happiness in a pocket. But finding the urge to reach deep enough down to scrape it up is hard. And the energy doesn't come in cans anymore.

      I'm alive. I suppose that that's as good as it gets in the eye of the storm. Wednesday night was like any other night, except that I had just gotten off the telephone with someone I hadn't spoken to in so long, someone whose voice grabbed me and pulled me some curtain and made me smile. After we had said our goodbyes, and with the promise of seeing the person the next day, I set about finishing up the last of the day's work then settling down on the couch to read my book. What caught my eye first was red letters that spelled tornado and then the word warning following. My heart dropped and I immediately journeyed outside to look at the dark spray of clouds that had been painted on the Western horizon. It was eerily silent and calm until the sirens began to wail in the distance. One began its long keening moan, then another, then another, so ominous that I actually got chills so real I felt like ice had been dumped on top of my head. I was nervous, scared, but I knew that getting completely off my rocker wouldn't help anything. My mother and I stayed calm. We stood like two sentinels by the storm door, watching through the window as the sky got darker and listening to the literally never ending thunder and the brillaint flashes of lightning that lit the sky up every few seconds. Around 9:00, We ventured back inside to watch the news, closing up the back porch tightly and making sure all of our pet cats were safely in the strong walls of the house. When the news just kept singing the same old song, and the wind and the rain and the hail were becoming hard to ignore, my mother stood up and went to look out our inside door. When I heard her mutter Oh My God, I reluctantly put my book down. I couldn't stop reading, I'm not sure if it was because I was actually engrossed in the book or it was an escape from the weather. The wind was blowing so hard it made the house shake and the rain disappear. And that's when the whirlwind started. The tree in front of my house gave a loud crack and the only thing I remember seeing before my mother pushed me backwards as the branch land right in front of the door. I was amazed but not frightened, in awe but not scared. My mother raced around the table to grab the flash light and she quickly ushered me and my dog down into the musty confines of our old basement. I wasn't worried at all about my safety, I was more worried about my cats. I had raced into the living room to grab them and all of them looked up at me as if to say, Are you leaving us behind? I couldn't grab all of them, I couldn't take them with me. So I turned and walked calmly for the basement, my mother practically screaming at me to get down. We no sooner arrived in the safe corner of the basement when the house gave a mighty shudder and a loud crack and crash drowned out the wind. Then, the lights flickered and went out and nothing but the flashlight's beacon kept us from the drowning blanket of darkness. It felt like forever but it had only been four or five minutes. When we ventured back up, the yard was littered with branches, many of them large and laying on top of something. Our 100 year old willow tree, my favorite tree, was cracked nearly in half, the mighty giant finally toppled, laying in waste across the road and partially on our other tree. I felt so overwhelemed, so lost, because my mother was lost. The pillar of strength that I had known her as had faltered that night and I know that she had lost it and all that kept us grounded and somewhat sane was me. It was me who had been calm, me who kept looking on the bright side of things. The bright side, the little things that made the stars and the moon pop out of the clouds and wave hello as we walked around our yard speechless. If the wind had shifted only a bit, if it had blown faster, harder, I might have not been able to walk around my yard, or I would have been painfully lost in the basement, or worse, I could be fine and everyone else could have been hurt, could have been killed. The little things like that really get to me, they really grab me and yank me around. It's the little things that mean so much, little gestures, little sayings you never forget, little looks that linger in your head. Little touches and caresses and kisses that mean more than anything else, that are worth more than diamonds to you. I think that is why I miss you so much. Because I miss the little things. And because I'm destined to miss the little things. I told myself long ago that I would wait for you. And I'm not sure if you know it or not. I'm prepared to wait for you forever if that's what it takes. The path I have chosen isn't the easiest, it bends, it twists, and is full of emotion but it's the path I am prepared to take. The next time I see you is when I'll know that for sure. I'm alive.

      Somehow things don't seem any different and I find myself wondering why. That's one word that crosses my mind a lot these days. Not like it really matters either way. Why is an enigmatic word in itself. Who invented why anyway? But I suppose that question is entirely too redundant. I'm sitting here, 12:14 in the morning, thinking about who else: You. Did you guess that? Thought so. I should be in bed seeing how I'm leaving with Jessie tomorrow morning at quarter to eight. But sleep doesn't come easy in the wee early hours of the morning for me. No, those are the hours that your face seems to like. Kind of like a flower just noticing the sun and opening it's petals to the rays in a cheery Good Morning. But I suppose that it's better that nothing, better than forgetting everything. My arms have been itching but I haven't been scratching them. It seems that the more you scratch an itch, the more it itches. So I haven't been. I think you would be proud of me. It's not easy, there's always that little voice. She keeps me awake when I need to be sleeping and gets me into all sorts of trouble. I suppose she's the entertainment here so maybe I should thank her for keeping my life in unorganized chaos. My dad got home from his business trip today. I don't think he was home for more than 10 minutes when he and my mother already stopped speaking to each other. Is this how all 26 year old marriages turn out to be? A constant battle between wills and a constant barrage of hurtful words and actions? It makes me want to isolate myself away from all men and strap on a chastity belt. Bet you wouldn't like that idea very much. People can't all be assholes can they? I mean we aren't born to have our head shoved up our asses are we? It seems to be a big topic nowadays, probably was a big issue way back in the day. Are people meant to be evil or are we born with a blank ticket and shipped off on trains with the hopes that we turn out all right? Good question but I don't think anybody has the answer. Just opinions. Everything is opinion nowadays. That's why I maintain, you shouldn't put all your trust in the government. Not with all the dickheads running that place. Too interested in what can line their own pocket books compared to the people. I can't say that I'm completely for Anarchy, though it has its upsides. I think that if our government dissolve and we could do whatever we wanted to, I'd get to you as soon as possible and see where you wanted to start first. And then I would continue with life like nothing was different. We are left with impressions on us that can never be lifted and I'm one of those very impressionable people. Pathetic as it may seem. I really hope that one day I can see you again. Until then, I'll just keep dreaming.

      I think that I'm just making the realization that there is some force out there that is constantly moving against me..Maybe it's moving against all of us, trying to make us unhappy. So we push harder and the harder we push the more the force works. Maybe it's Fate, maybe it's the Universe. Who knows. I spent the day with Jessie today and that felt good. It felt good to just be next to a friend again and not be so alone. I mean being alone is good sometimes but being alone too much can only be described as a well. A big friggin well full of water..And you're the cat. Horrible comparison I know but bare with me, I'm in mourning. And I'm also very frustrated. Highly frustrated. And creatively constipated. And that's even worse than being constipated physically. *sigh* Not to mention, I'm a little more emotional than usual because of..ahem...circumstances I'm not comfortable speaking about online where people can read about them. Lately I just feel tired and upset and desperate for an outlet. So I'm looking into writing..Well, I've been big into writing before but I took a vacation when school started. Now I'm starting to get the itch though I'm not sure where to begin. Beginnings are always shaky for me but if I start things right they usually get better..Really better. *sigh* Designing characters have usually been pretty easy for me but I want to get better. Good luck finding books with help to create a character. I know you don't want a list of regular questions because that would make your character 2 dimensional but just a few guidelines so I would know where to start. lol Listen to me prattling on and on. I'm horrible when it comes to that. Well..The sketch pad calls to me. Until my next depressing entry.

      I thought that once school let out Monday's were supposed to get more interesting. Oh well, I won't hold my breath anymore. Blue really doesn't compliment me anyway. Well, this is the place to get off whatever's on my mind and I guess that this is what's on my mind the most right now. I was talking to Jess tonight and she asked me, after reading this blog, if Ben was all I ever thought about. Taking a look back on everything, I realize that I have been pretty shallow and callous when it comes to Ben and Jess and now that I see it, I'm sorry. I feel bad talking to Jess about Ben because sometimes it seems like she just doesn't want to hear it. Who can blame her? It's not a very fun conversation piece, especially since she's Ben's cousin. Kind of awkward moment there. I just can't help myself and I hope she'll understand that, cause I know sometimes it's hard for me to understand it myself. He's my first boyfriend, the first person to ever really want to be with me in that way and all just because I'm me. It's one of the best feelings in the world and I don't want to miss out on anything because I already regret too much. Jess is the closest thing I have to a sister right now and if I lose that, I don't know what I'd do. Probably fall apart more than I am now. Looking at the clock, I'm realizing that it's now only 11 o clock at night. It's still too early to call it a night and I'm bored and increasingly lonely. Story of Sam I suppose.

        urlLink       I've come to take you.  urlLink What character from a creepy anime are you?   urlLink     I'm lonely and the only other person in the room with me is my reflection. She doesn't provide much company, that one. She mostly just sits there and stares off into space. When I do try to talk to her, she just gives me this strange look. I'm starting to lose my grip on things. My perspective is being steadily warped and I'm starting to really go down. This has happened before, I go and I go until my fuel runs out and the airplane goes down. It's not really a surprise that it's starting to happen again. I suppose it's not the worst pattern. Be the Phoenix, rise from the ashes then spontaneously combust again. Sounds like a plan. Yeah, no one ever mentions the inevitable BURNING feeling associated with crashing. This unbearable slow deterioration that starts in the back of the head, like a mold, and spreads and spreads until it's all you can taste in your mouth. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is sitting back and watching it all happen and knowing that nothing short of a miracle is going to save you from yourself, from the torch. It sucks to be the bucket of gasoline when the sky rains fire. And most of the time this anger, this desire to just scream my head off, is sequestered within me because I CAN'T be mad, I CAN'T be crabby. Because I know what it feels like to be on the receiving end and I told myself a long time ago that I would never do that to anybody. Anger is bad, yelling is bad, don't yell, don't protest, just do it, don't complain. Because if you complain they'll just get angrier. And you never know when they're going to walk out the door and run right into a pole and have a freak accident. I'm sorry your mother was driving home when a fly flew through the window and obscured her vision. She drove the rest of the way home fine until she pulled into the driveway when the fly came back with a vengeance and she choked on it. Never got to say bye, I love you, Drive careful. Yeah, what irony. What makes it worse is that while you're sitting in the muddy trenches and pits of the deepest grief and sorrow, the world keeps moving, things keep growing, and everyone moves on without you. Leave me behind world, we can't both make it. Don't speak it'll only make things worse. Everything I've ever wanted to say to you is locked in my closet, perfectly accessible save for the attack kitten sitting in front of it. She loves me, that cat. We sit up and have talks every night about you, about how great you are, about how much I fucking miss you and how much I can't take life anymore. How I can't take being alone and my god I find myself shaking with pathetic emotions because you know what..It's only been a week or so since I wasn't alone. Only a week..And already I'm insane. Already I'm crying MEDICATION, HELP, THERAPY. Sam can't handle herself anymore, Better call an ambulance! Well gosh, too late. She's already bit the barrel, darn. There goes another one, they'll say, another one so full of promise and individuality. What's wrong with the kids today? Nothing, what's wrong with the adults today? Nothing, what's wrong with the world today? And the best answer to that would be nothing so people will say nothing because that's what they want to hear. Do you know what I want to hear? I want to hear your voice and your heartbeat and you. I want to hear you. But that's not going to happen is it? No, because nothing ever stays put. The world keeps turning and the scenery keeps changing and the people keep moving. They leave and you hand them your phone number and they take one look at it and laugh. I don't have time for you anymore, they say, I'm moving with the world. I don't have time to dwell here, in the place that always rains and never changes and always stays still. I'm sorry I live here but I couldn't handle the motion of the oceans and the jet stream. You move a little too quickly for Sam, I'm tired, I'm lonely, and I'm fucking pissed off. But can I do anything about it? Yes, I can save my soul.

      I usuall write my best when I'm depressed and incredibly tired but hey what the hell, I'll have a go. I haven't been feeling quite myself lately, for example, at night, I start to get these stomach aches and when I stand up I get this rush of dizziness and for a while my vision dots black. It's getting more annoying than anything else and I think I'd like to complain to the manager. Not like the manager ever really does anything anyway besides sit there and look at you while you make a total fool of yourself. I wouldn't want to be a manager of a store or anything. People are too damn whiny and I can't handle them. I'd just as soon slap them as soon as they open their mouth then send them away with some nice door prizes. Two hours until noon, Yay, and here I sit, in my pajamas with dirty hair and no makeup..I'm such a lazy bastard. LOL But it's a Sunday! My mom and Dad just left for the Airport. My dad is going to Detroit for a whole week!! SCORE!!! Now I'll REALLY have the house to myself ALL WEEK LONG....*falls over* I never thought it possible! Of course, my mom does get home @ 3:30 so I'm afraid wild parties are out of the question..*sigh* I went to a party @ a friend's house last night. It was hilarious!! First, we got there and jumped into his truck and he took us for a really fun ride down the road! One of his friends was sitting on the hood and he crawled up over the cab of the truck and down into the back with us. Daredevils. Then we played this fantastic new game they invented called 'Barnball'. Basically, barnball is basketball in a barn with no rules..Since the guys were all down in another building on the property, the girls all got the basketballs and had a rough game of barnball. Well, two of the guys came in and played with us before we took a permenant break. It was a good excuse to whip Emily around. We knocked each other over, pushed each other into walls, I ripped two holes in my pants and got a bloody and fat lip. Yeah, let's see the guys top that. lol Oh...and I talked to Jessie yesterday whose seen Ben (it's funny, it's like I'm researching Big Foot and I've just found my key witness to his existence..0_o)and she said he asked about me..hehehe..*blush* Yeah, little things like that make me happy..Pathetic, right? Oh well...

      The skies are finally blue here and as I look out over the azure hued scenery I can't help but think if you're looking at the same sky I am. You once told me you don't look at the sky but how can I believe that. You're such a dreamer and sometimes when I glance at you you'll have this faraway look in your eyes and I can't help but smile. I'm not doing much here, just trying to get over some illnesses. I was up all night last night sitting in the bathroom because it felt like my stomach was going to crawl up my throat at any moment. When I did finally get to sleep, It was damn near 3 AM. Woke up around noon and my stomach was still doing little flip flops so I'm just sitting here taking it easy. Derick's graduation party is today and as bad as I feel about it, I'm not going to go. It would be just my luck to get there and then embarrass myself by throwing up all over people. Oh god, how mortifying! Besides, I really wasn't prepared to go in the first place and seeing how you're not going either I don't feel as bad as I could. And being around Derick is kind of uncomfortable since Emily broke up with him. I didn't think Emily gave him enough of a chance, sure, but she's still my best friend, more like my sister at times, and it's kind of weird when he just starts talking about her bitterly. I'm sorry for what she did to him but I consider both of them good friends..and well...getting stuck between them is definitely something that grates on my nerves. I'm always the mediator it seems..I guess it's just because of my understanding nature. LOL..Funny, right? You sounded kind of sick on the last days of school, maybe I got this damn cold from you. The moment summer vacation hits I get a cold. What are the odds? Oh well, It hasn't been that bad. All I know is report cards come out Monday/Tuesday and I'm dreading to see what I got on my final exams. I know, it's my own fault I didn't study, but honestly, the days just drag on and on and AHH! lol Sometimes you just have to scream. Just like sometimes you have to say what the fuck..Good quote, Thanks Booger! I'm a little more light hearted than usual, maybe it's because I'm sick, maybe it's because I know that went camping and are hopefully having a fun time with Jess and the others. I'm stuck here for awhile but it's okay because I'm starting to feel better and that's always a good thing.

      Who am I to fuck around with Mother Nature? Seriously though, I'm a little tired of all this rain. Well, today was rather boring, in a weird way. You see I went to Emily's house around one and from there we walked in a downpour to the Mayberry Public Library. Fun place that place, all those books. I was in heaven, as you can imagine.I thought about you, and how I was hoping to see you walk through those doors. I'm dying to get just one more glimpse of you. Emily and I then rented Queen of the Damned and ran back to her house before the rain started again. We stayed there for as long as it took our pants and socks to dry in the dryer and then we walked to McDonald's for dinner. I was hoping to see you there too but no such luck. Well, it started to pour and we got stranded in Micky D's for a while before calling Al and getting her to pick us up. Then we went back to Em's house and screwed around (not like that. I know you would enjoy that too much.) until Al and B.M. got there. Then we just did girl stuff, watched Goldmember and danced around crazily to music. And as I sat there I realized just how much I didn't want to be there with them but with you. I love my friends but sometimes I just want you. We're talking about getting Em's party room set up and having a few parties. I want you to come to some of them, I want to show you my idea of partying and having fun and being myself. I want to spend as much with you as I can before you leave. I guess this is my way you telling you things I can't and hoping that you're missing me just as much as I miss you. The weather reflects my mood, forlorn, soaking wet with emotion that can't be reciprocated until I see your face. I just wish that the days would go faster and the nights wouldn't drag on forever so I wouldn't drive myself insane. So for now I'll just sleep and dream and hopefully that will get me through.

      As I looked up from my fence post, I found myself staring out over the uneven horizon and wondering about you and your face. It's really very hot outside, or maybe it's just me. I've been working constantly all day long, only stopping for a short trip up to Fond du Lac and back and then for a small lunch. We got all the fence posts in the arena, not like you really care but just listen anyway, and got them all cemented in. I almost fell over a couple times, my head still feels a little dizzy from my cold, but my nose is getting better and I haven't even really been coughing much. I think I might be losing my voice but it's summer, right? :) Bought the Trapt CD...Very depressing and inspirational, just what I need to jumpstart my writing. Like an electric shock, like every time you touch me or hold my hand...Ah but I'm babbling. I'm a little hungry, so I might get some pizza. I'll write more to you next time, forgive me. I'm tired..

      Oh boy....Sitting here staring out the window, I wonder where you are and what you're doing. Everything is fine here. I'm feeling a little sick, got a tad bit of a cold, and I'm tired but I'm content and I suppose that's all that matters. Outside my neighbors and my mother and aunt are putting in fence posts for our riding arena. And so begins the Riding Season 2004! The sun is shining and the weather is finally getting better. Last night I went to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. You would have liked it, I know you would have. Maybe you and I will go see it soon, just you and me. I won't tell you anything except that you'll be amazed. Tonight I will be staying up later than before, though it's probably not a good idea in my condition. But school's out and it's not like I have to rest up on Sunday, right? Only 9 more days until I can hopefully speak to you again, hopefully fall into your embrace and tell that I've missed you. Well, I should really get going and see if anybody needs my help. Love you!      I think about your face and how I fall into your eyes, The outline that I trace around the one that I call mine     -Sam

      I'm mad, I'm bitter, I'm sad, I'm lost. Wow, it's so funny how I'm feeling all these things and yet feeling nothing. There's no one else in this house except for my reflection, which I pass every so often by a mirror or window. It's actually quite lonely but don't tell anybody that. I didn't want anyone here anyway. People are stupid and incompetent and if they would just think every once in a while I wouldn't have such a problem with them. But they don't. And then they complain and they whine and they bitch and that's when I want to turn around and concentrate on their tiny brains until they explode. I hate them. I hate them so much that I want to kill them. I want to see their blood everywhere, on my hands, on my face, on my clothing. I want to bathe in blood and drink blood because for once that blood wouldn't be mine. I'm starting to question my suffering and I'm starting to see that its bullshit. I don't want to bleed myself for comfort anymore. I want to see everyone else hurt, I want to see them cry and them be alone. I want to watch them be in pain because for once I wouldn't be watching myself. There are a lot of people out there who say the same thing but when it comes down to it, they can't because of their humanity, or at least that's what humans call it. They'll only use the knife/pull the trigger when frightened, when backed into a corner, but approach me at all and I'll gash your eyes out, I'll put holes in your stomach, I'll tear into you over and over until you don't even look like a human. You'd lay on the floor, gasping for what air you could suck in, while you bled all over onto my carpet and died on my floor. And I would stand over you stained with the pulsing of your veins and smile. And laugh. And I would say, "Wow, I feel a lot better now." Sometimes I wish someone would attack me, go after me and try to hurt me, just so I would have an excuse to kill them. Because I am bound by chains that hold me back. My mind tells me that I'm smarter than that, I'm clever, I have to wait, be patient. So I lie like a sleeping demon underneath soft bed sheets, just waiting for someone to step on me. Sometimes my eyes get cold and the smell of snow surrounds me and sometimes that little voice in my head will get the better of me and I'll break. I love the winter sky and the stars that reflect on the icey snow. It is my realm, where everything is dead, and the icicles bleed at the sun's touch. I used to be willing to be hurt but now I am willing to hurt, ready to hurt, waiting to hurt. Does this scare you? Do I seem sick because of it? Do you think I'm insane? Or do you pity me? Whatever you feel for me is best kept to yourself because I only end up hurting those who trust me. It's just the way I am, born with knives for hands and razors for fingers. I hurt because I am hurt and nothing will change that. I sometimes wish they would all just leave me to die because it would be easier that way, wouldn't it? My favorite word is Hate and for good reason because I hate so very much. This book doesn't have a happy ending. Everybody dies.

      It seems like forever since I last came on here to write down my woes. Maybe it's just the rollercoaster I seem to have been floating on and off of, or maybe it's just the fact that so much has changed so quickly that I can't even begin to grasp the effect of it all, the magnitude of everything. Ben left on Thursday and the entire time I just felt sick to my stomach. I went to Emily's house to get my mind off of things and everywhere I looked I was reminded of him in some little way and it hurt but not as much as the fact that now I have stepped away from the relationship, I can look back on things he has said or done to me and see just how stupid I was not to see it then. That as much as I wanted to believe it he didn't really love me the way I need to be loved. At first, I was just so..nauseous at the fact that we had broken up and that I could no longer look at him the same. The change freaked me out so much that I almost threw up Wednesday night. I couldn't sleep because I just felt so horrible and choked up. But now that the world is moving and the clock is spinning I'm feeling much better and much more optimistic about the future. School's going to be starting soon, My sister and Shane are moving back home, Jessie and I'll be heading out for some good shopping trips and Em and I will hopefully also hit the stores soon. Life looks pretty damn good right now so screw the opposite sex and bring on the fun...:) It's about time for rest and relaxation away from myself.

      Life is changing every day, April slowly drifts into May, &nbsp;I'm floating further away from you, Just like May will slowly change to June. &nbsp; I'm not sure if with your eyes you see, How distant I have seemed to be. But if you loved me,  I'm sure you'd know, This is all the further I want to go. &nbsp; The clock is tick, tick, ticking away, And I don't feel like wasting anymore days,&nbsp; On a love I feel isn't going anywhere. The dream I have enjoyed has now changed into a nightmare. &nbsp; And though my heart is aching, Ties with you I am intent on breaking.&nbsp; When you journey off into the sky, You won't be leaving just me behind. &nbsp; Set me free before you go, Leave me to wander in the snow, You spread your wings and I'll spread mine, And we'll part&nbsp;the waves to see what's to find. &nbsp; The night sky will never be the same, And when I look at the winter clouds I'll feel a certain pain, That's there in my heart just for you, And wonder where we ever went to. &nbsp; And even though I'll miss what we've become, I just can't keeping hanging on. The air below has become quite clear, And I can see the ground is getting too near. It's time to jump, It's time to fall, I just hope I'll survive it all. Goodbye for now, We'll make it through somehow. The stars are getting closer, I hope we find our answers. The clouds are thinning, My head is spinning. My heart is breaking, This is how it's going to end. &nbsp; Things change every day, April slowly drifts into May. Like the clockwork death of the lonesome butterfly, June will tip toe into the doorway of July. &nbsp; -Written @ 2:00 AM, July 19th, 2004. I call it..Time's Farewell to The Voyaging Soldier. You aren't going to be the focus of my blogs anymore, I'm going to bury you one way or another, and get you out of my head, because this is just how things were supposed to go. I smell like raspberries and sleep in the morning while you smell of smoke and you just can't touch me whenever and wherever you want to anymore. I can't be with you anymore because I can't give you what you want and you can't give me what I need. It's really that simple. If you ever read these, I hope you'll smile and see how much I really did love you but not harbor any bad feelings toward me. Because I know I don't have any for you. You were my first kiss and you're always going to be my first love but first loves aren't meant to be long. Let it stay special and let's say goodbye. Goodnight, We'll see how things go my next post.

       At first I thought it was the music at the end of every anime show I watched, the haunting melodies that spoke of the sadness of the characters in lullabies sung by ghosts. But I realized as I kept hearing more and more that it wasn't really the notes that got to me, it was what the notes represented in my head. Each note held a picture, held a feeling, an emotion that never seemed to make me smile but only to make me hurt. And then I found out it wasn't that either. I'm just missing you. Things will never be like they used to be but you can't stop water from flowing anymore than time. Even if you turn off the clock, it still goes on and I guess life does too. I was in the car with my parents one time, driving down the highway, when my father started driving a little too recklessly. We almost sideswiped a car and almost rear-ended another going 80 MpH. And I remember closing my eyes because I didn't want to see the windshield crack and the glass fly everywhere. I remember focusing on the music playing in the background because I didn't want to hear metal crunching. Because I wasn't ready to die. A few years later I'm in the same position and as I close my eyes, I smile. Because inwardly, I am ready to die. My business is not finished, My life isn't complete, but I was happy. That moment I was happy, I was smiling, I was happy. I wouldn't have minded dieing at that moment. But I didn't. I'm still here, still writing down all my thoughts and feelings. I have a feeling I'm still going to be here for a very long time, like an old soul that never fades. You told me that you were going to miss me so&nbsp;much and it just made me laugh. Time heals all wounds, you'll only miss me for a little while. So I told you that I would be here when you got back. And even though you said you knew that, I had a feeling that you were waiting for me to say it. Nothing is certain in this world and I won't make any promises to you because I know this. Things change, nothing is ever the same. Though you may not feel it, I do. Things aren't the same between us. Everything has changed and as much as I don't want to admit it, it has.&nbsp; A long time ago I wanted so badly to tell you to never leave me, to always hold me the way you were doing, and to love me. But I didn't say anything. Because I knew that one day everything would be different and I didn't want to hurt you. I still don't. Because I love you. But sometimes love changes. Time heals all wounds but it can cause some. I think it's definitely done some damage in our case. But then again, it may be that it's just me.&nbsp; I don't want to let you go but I don't want to hang on. What would you say if I told you this? How would you react? I'm not saying I want to end it. But I'm growing up, I always have been. And as I grow up, are you willing to grow with me and take this to the next level? I think I could definitely enjoy this if we'd just...do...more things together. Take a walk, go shopping, see a movie, just be with each other instead of trying to find someplace to be alone so we can kiss and makeout. But if that's all you want to do, if that's all this is for you, an outlet for passions you need to express......It would hurt me and I would hate myself more than anything. Because I would have to say goodbye. I would have to kiss you and tell you that our story has ended because I couldn't do it. I should probably be telling you this instead of airing it to internet. I only have four more days until you go off and leave the place that always rains. I think I don't say anything because I'm afraid of what you would say. You've always told me the truth and how you felt. I know you wouldn't lie to me no matter what the consequences...Would you be so willing to say goodbye? Or would you be willing to go deeper into what we've become and get past the hormonal urges of adolescence and BE with me? I'm older than I am and if I'm going to be in a relationship, I'm going to be in a committed and meaningful relationship. I'm not one to jump from boyfriend to boyfriend because I want something more. Do you? Or am I going to have to let you go too? Thinking like this makes me heartsick and angry and hurt and frustrated...But know this..I'm old enough to make sacrifices and if I have to sacrifice what I feel when I'm around you for the sake of finally standing up for what I want.........I reluctantly will.

      Cna't really put a finger on what I'm feeling. Maybe a little bitter, maybe a little sad, maybe a little numb. Who knows? I'm blown away by the sight a hose emptying water onto a dirty cement floor and I wonder if this isn't what makes me so damn different. I've just drank the last of my soda but it's not like it's the end. But how am I to know that? Six months..Half a year..what is going to seem like half a lifetime. This issue seems to be popping up lately. I don't want to let go but my fingers are slipping and as I close my eyes to go to sleep I can't help but see you god damn face. I can't help but be tortured by you, every night when I supposed to be dead to the world. Tonight I will see you in those lighted corridors and you will pass me like the wind brushes against the flame of a candle. And I will turn to follow you and find you gone. I will hurt, I will cry, I will run until I find you again. And you will hold me and comfort me. It's like there are two of you in my dreams, two of you in my head, two of your haunting souls that never cease to chase me. You don't want to leave anymore than I want you to and doesn't that fit the description of the fate, star-crossed lovers. I've always wanted a fairy tale romance and though you're more like a ghost tale told around a campfire I can't help but want that more than anything else I could have ever imagined. Time will tell me the tale of a dead man. I am sure I'll be captivated by it's morbid words and I will become a slave to the calendars plastering my walls. The number of days will turn into the number of weeks and they will turn into the number of months and I will be here. Listening to words paired with music, smiling at water hoses spilling their blood onto the hard crust layering the earth, marred with pink scars. I am like a damaged toy, one you always handle with care, one you always hold and take pity on. I don't want pity...I don't want your sympathy..I want you to see me for what I am..An angry bitch, a ranting, raving lunatic, a crazy mother fucker with no hopes of recovery. I'm sick, I'm never going to get better so don't fucking lie to me! Don't treat me like a doll! Smash me around, kick me when I'm done, Hurt me like no one else has ever hurt me! You know you want to, so just do it. Throw me on the floor and make me eat dirt because everybody wants to take a swing at me sometime or another. Just tear me in half, tear me apart, reach down my throat and grab my heart and then smile and kiss me and tell me you love me. Cause you know I die to hear you say it and when you do I have to stop and tell myself that it isn't real. You're not really there, You're not really saying it..It's a good dream, that one, and I can't help but play along. Because I want to believe it so much but somehow something won't let me. There isn't much time left, I can't let you go without seeing your face again, I can't sit here knowing that every day we grow farther and farther apart and that we're getting older and older, one more step closer to death's door, five minutes away from too late. If you could just hold me and let me fall alseep in your arms to the tune of your heartbeat, the last words I hear being I love you and I'll come back to you, I could go on with a sense of hope...I could be happy for just that one instant in time....

      Tell me to stop...Take me into your arms and yell at me..Hurt me, abuse me, it's what I want, it's what I need. Take your pain out on my soul, I won't mind. Bend me, warp me, twist me until I can't breathe. It's okay, keep going. I'm here for you to scream at when you need to scream, I'm here for you to hurt when you need to hurt. Let me bleed for you, let me be in pain for you. I don't mind. Visit me in the middle of the night when I'm sleeping and wake me up just to fill me up with your sorrows. I'll take you in my arms and hold you until you stop and then I'll kiss you and tuck you into bed. I won't mind. I don't ask for anything in return, I'm yours to abuse. My body is here, my soul is near, and I'm ready to be beaten. I don't mind. Let your weight fall on me and let me be crushed because it's what I'm here for. I'll hand you the knife, I'll stand still while you shove it past the skin, through the layers of tissue and muscle, through my bones, and into my heart. Let me bleed in front of you, just let the blood flow and spill all over me and you and the floor. Let it pool under our feet and soak the carpet. Every once in awhile, I'll need a break but if during that time you need me, I'll stop and I'll let you cling to me. I'm your pillow you scream into, I'm the wall you punch your fists through. I am the one destined for this, don't feel bad. I don't mind. I never scream, I never cry, I am nothing. I am empty. The world passes by this old soul. The leaves may change color, may die, may be reborn, and I am witness to the death of that which surrounds me. I watch them decay, watch the ties that bind them rot under old age. I watch their tears, I know that which they fear, I am the silent guardian. This taste in my mouth won't ever go away, I'll remember it. I'll wait in the driveway for the comfort that will never come. I'll stand silent through the wind, the rain, and the storms to see you, until all the blood has left me and I am nothing but a hollow, pale shell of a human being. But that's not what scares me. What frightens me is what time will do to you. Please, shape me anyway you want, hurt me over and over again until I can't stand, hit me, punch me, rape me, but please don't leave me. I don't want to let go of you, I don't want you to let go of me. This can't be the end. Please, please, please, please, do anything you want to me but please please please please don't forget me here. Don't leave me here forever, please. I'm on my hands and knees bleeding all over the place for you. Please remember me, please remember what I feel like, please don't let this be the end. I can't stand for it to be the end. I never scream, I never cry, I am nothing. But I can beg because nothing in itself is something. I love you and I'm lost but at least I can be lost with you.

      I'm tired but I'm always tired. There's nothing different about today, except for maybe there's a new pain in my head and another voice that whispers in the back of my head. There's nothing to really look forward to, no hope for a future worth waiting for. I'm sick of waiting around, I'm sick of being stuck here. Nobody really gives a shit so why should I? Don't toy with me, just let me stay by the banks of a river that never dries up and never stops flowing. A babbling brook that I can just float away in without worrying about the next period of rain or the next tidal wave coming to gobble me up. If you're going to leave me, just do it, because even I can't stop the tears from falling and the last thing I want you to see is me crying. I'm lonely and I'm depressed. What's new? What's worth noting? I slash up my arms to make myself feel better, I hurt myself instead of hurting others. I see my problem, I see the solution, but what I don't see is the effort to get there. I'm impatient with the world and if it can't keep up I won't mind leaving it behind me. The need to get out of this place that always rains is getting stronger. So I'll just keep those in my heart inside a metal photo frame and one day head out and forget about everything that makes me feel safe. It's time to live a little and I'm sick of waiting.

      I hate it here. I don't think anyone likes being here. If they hate it so much, why don't they just leave? I think I'd like it a lot more if I was alone in this place anyway. Nothing to worry about, no eggshells to fall upon and cut my skin, nothing to bleed over, nothing to wake up for. No hope, no sanity, I think that sounds just fine. I wake up only to want to go back to sleep because every little thing I do, everything little thing I say, is somehow wrong, either to me or them. I can't make anybody happy because I can't even be happy myself. My optimism is forced, bright cheery attitudes fake because that's not really me. There is this dark side of Sam that few ever truly see, though faint glimpses will show to those privileged few. I can't help those around me in pain because I myself am hurting, dazed and confused from feeling guilty over nothing. My best friend's mother is dying and before I return to school, I'll be attending her funeral. If it hurts me this much and makes me so damn sick, I can't even imagine how she feels, hurt, alone, pathetically weak and powerless, but above all, the anger. Resonating anger that permeates beneath the skin and cannot evaporate through the small pores. It builds and builds and soon the smoke pours out of the eyes and the fire races into the brain and all the eyes can see is flame and blackness. Watching her suffer makes me feel guilty for feeling so down, for feeling like Sam, depressed, dark, and sullen. If I feel ashamed for feeling like myself, how can I continue? Every day is a shade of the next and every night I can't help but dream of this dark shadow of a man who sees me for who I am and wants to celebrate me and be with me and just love me. I'm 16 and already a hopeless romantic who searching for a being that only exists within the painted imaginations of a storyboard. This is who I am, the Sam who wants to bleed, the Sam who likes black and red, the sad and tortured Sam who just wants to be Sam and noone else. And everytime I tell myself that It's Time and Sam is going to come out to play, something happens and my love for others pushes me farther inside myself. Farther in where I comfort myself and tell myself things will be alright. People have said that to me but it's been a long time since I've heard a reply similar to that that's fueld with honesty. If you want to fucking lie to me, then go ahead because I'm fucking lieing to you. I don't want to be here anymore than you do and I don't want to carry the world of others on my already sore and tired shoulders. If people would just leave me alone for awhile it would be a miracle. But no, it wouldn't matter anyway, what the fuck am I rattling on for? I know what will happen. The moment someone needs me I'm there, the moment someone is crying, I'm there, The moment someone is angry and needs to talk, I'm there. But when I need someone I turn to myself, When I am crying, I turn to myself, when I am angry and need to vent there's noone there but myself. It's nobody but me and that god damn fucking slice of silver steel and maybe that's the way things were meant to be. I hurt because I am being hurt, an eye for a fucking eye. I hate it here. But nobody really likes it here.
