      Wow, my first blog. I feel so invigorated by all the possibilities! I'm embarking on a new adventure! I can create and mould this blog into whatever I want it to be! And soon, I shall become...a blogger...

      I'm not sure why I have such a hard time getting into the swing of things on a Monday morning. I find it difficult to bring myself to do any actual work before lunchtime and feel like I'm operating in a dazed state. Okay, well, that's not entirely true because I do work and accomplish things in the a.m., but I just don't like to launch into any involved projects before lunch. So, my morning consists of responding to emails, planning and activities for the week ahead, returning phone calls and reading any materials circulated round the office. Ususally we have a staff meeting which will take up 1 or 2 hours which works out perfectly because by the time the meeting is out it's usually around noon or 1 pm. On the upside, at least my coworkers know me well enough to avoid engaging me in any lengthy conversations on a Monday morning. If they do, the sound of my 'morning voice' will likely make them think twice before doing it often. I have nothing against mindless chatter; it's just that I tend not to be chatty in the mornings. Of course, anyone reading this probably knows that about me already.    Today I just got back some pictures from my trip. I have yet to join the those who partake in the instant gratification of digital photography so I had to wait for my film to be developed before I could see that half of the photos I took are in fact pure crap. I love taking pictures, documenting friends and events so I can look back and fondly remember that yes, I did enjoy the time I spent (wherever, whenever) and could probably tell some crazy fun stories to go along with the pictures. So, it's quite a conundrum really as to why I haven't jumped on the digital photography bandwagon. This most recent vacation has propelled me to change that. The morning that I was going to leave for Germany, I discovered that my trusty camera, the very same one responsible for all college photo albums wrought with debauchery and embarrassing moments for all was broken. I then had no camera available to me! How could it have happened that I had been living my life, in this modern world, in a hip city, with no photographic equipment what-so-ever! You see, I come form a fairly (camera) trigger-happy upbringing. Every member of my family has at least 2, more likely 3 or 4 different cameras, yet in some state of obvious irrationality, I convinced myself that the extras were clutter and I didn't really need them.   In any case, I shall now embark on the search for the perfect camera. Never again shall I allow myself to be the victim of a disposable camera and it's featureless offerings!

      Believe it or not, every once in a while I like to leave the Bay Area. As you all know, I love San Francisco, Berkeley the Bay Area (which, in case you hadn't heard, does not include San Jose). I also love traveling and every time I return I appreciate what a beautiful and unique place San Francisco is.   Germany was a lot of fun. Kim, Marty, Oliver and I went to quite a few places around southern Germany in the sweet Mercedes Benz we rented. I'll have to get some pictures and post them. Unfortunately, it rained on and off for most of the time, but I think I still got some good photos.  Some of the highlights were the beer of course!; seeing the many castles scattered throughout the hillsides; Rhine River boat cruise, visit to the Porche factory (where I tried to get a job as a test driver- unfortunately, that didn't work out); Baden-Baden (spa town with mineral baths and swanky shops and a casino); driving through the Black Forrest; visit to Frieburg, which is actually in the Black Forrest, has a really cool brewery, the 'old town' has intricate cobblestone-mosaic sidewalks and streets with open gutters- which I should mention, you must be careful not to step in while walking back to your hotel drunk from the brewery; we stopped in Fussen to see the fairy-tale castle; and then onto Munich! Munich is the type of place that I need to go back to. It's a great city with lots to do and when the weather is nice you can fully appreciate the parks and the beer gardens.   I also picked up a little German. Here are a few phrases I found helpful while there (spelled  sort of  phonetically for ease of pronunciation):  "Bitte ein bier?" (say with a cute smile to the bartender as an apology for poor pronunciation)   Please, a beer?     "Bitte ein bild?" (say with a cute smile to a boy as an apology for poor pronunciation)   Please, take a picture?   "shIza!"   Shit!   "Fair-root!"  Cool!   "Das iz fair-root shIza!" That is cool shit!  "Das iz koo shIza!"  That is cow shit!   "Haben zie baden shaum?"  Do you have any bubble bath?   As you can clearly see- all very useful phrases.  So, for now, I'm just battling some minor jet lag and wondering when and where my next big out-of-country trip will be. I'll try to get some Germany pictures up on this blog soon too!

      My co-worker Rob (who is my bosses boss and practically the head of my entire company) asked me to house-sit while he and his family went on vacation for 3 weeks to France and Italy. So I agreed to stay there (not because I'm a kiss-up, but because they have a cute house with a great remodeled kitchen in relaxing Menlo Park).   I was inexplicably drawn to the Viking stove and oven and All-Clad cookware. So, one evening I decided to get crafty and cook myself dinner. I had things going on the stove and something in the oven as well when I got a phone call. As I'm catching up with a friend, I suddenly realized that I need to check the oven, so I looked- and good thing I checked because it was on the verge of burning. I quickly grabbed the towel hanging on the oven handle, take out the pan and see that the towel now has a hole burnt in it approximately 5 inches in diameter.   I immediately ran it under water to stop the burning. Made sure that I was not on fire and that the house was not on fire. I told myself that accidents happen and a towel shouldn't be too big a deal, right? Immediately following that, reality and my usual level-headed logic set in. The truth is, this was not a 'normal' kitchen towel. It was a fine cotton towel with embroidery on it with flowers and writing which said 'a gift from France' or 'a touch of France' or something along those lines. This towel obviously came from France and had some sentimental value that I would never be able to quantify. Of course, now I'm back to freaking out because I think they must have got it on their honeymoon or it was passed down as an heirloom in their family or someone brought it for them as a special handmade gift- the possibilities were endless!  I knew I wouldn't just be able to walk into Williams-Sonoma and get a replacement so I consulted the wisdom of a select group of trusted friends. Some of the great advice I got was to just throw it away, never bring it up and hope they think they lost it themselves. My other option was to just tell them the truth and offer to replace it. This seemed like an empty offer to me because this towel was obviously something imported and they had had it for a while. But in the end, that's what I went with and hoped that they wouldn't take me up on it because then I'd probably either have to go to France and find someone to recreate the embroidered design.   How does this all end you ask? Well, I too have been full of anticipation and today, Rob is back from his trip. He hadn't said anything about the note I left or the towel when he came in, but I knew it was only a matter of time.   I had to go down to his office to get some things signed so I told him in person that Im sorry I ruined it. And he tells me he was thinking he would give me a hard time about it and tell me that his wife's grandmother gave to her on her deathbed. I think all the blood and color must have left my face at that point because he followed up with a "no, really, it's zero big deal and dont even think about replacing it." Whew! He also mentioned that he's glad I didn't burn the house down. And of course, now they want to hear the story- which really isn't all that interesting. I'm just glad it's finally all over with.   I wonder if I'll ever get asked to house-sit again...
