      Today was a beautiful day. First we bought a mattress for my parents. Then we bought a lamp for the living room. Then we bought a car for my sister. Then we bought a new shower curtain. I will explain.  Actually we bought the mattress a while ago and it just happened to be delivered today. It's one of those really really nice Tempurpedic ones. Not that you care. I am just trying to show how crazy my mom is and just how much money she spent today.  The lamp we orderd last week also arrived today. It's wierd ana kinda funky. I like it though. Anyway, it defies description so you will just have to come see it.  Oh yes! And they bought Kathleen and brand new 2004 electric blue Honda Civic. It is a beautiful car. And I got to drive it before her! hahah! With her having a new car that means I get her old car (it's not a bad 1997 Oldsmobile Cutlass) and I don't have to drive the stinky Subaru! It's just swell.  After all of this buying funanaza my mom and I went to Fred Meyer. We got distracted and found ourselves buying a whole bunch of new stuff for the bathroom. (Mariatina will need a towel!) And ended up with a new shower curtain and 4 towels to match. Then we bought groceries.  AND THE BEST PART WAS.... I FINALLY FINISHED CLEANING MY ROOM!!! It's beautiful!!  As is Cold Mountain.  Tomorrow is a driving lesson (yeah i know its ridiculous) and cleaning Mariatina's future room.  Thats all for now.  Love, Caitlin  "Let no one ever come to you without leaving better or happier."

We staged the finale today.. it creepycool.  Someone please leave a comment!  Love, Caitlin  "Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier." Mother Theresa

       If you are perplexed by the title.. have no fear. Amanda and I have took it upon ourselves, in a way to honor Natalie, to incoprorate the folling words into our vocabulary: golly, jimminy, gollygeewiz, silly, swell and exceterea. (I added the last one.. if you don't mind Amanda, I think it adds a nice touch.)  Rehersal sucked today. Sucked sucked sucked. It was just loong and boring and my feet hurt. Yes, I know what you are thinking, "whine, whine, whine, all you do is whine Caitlin!" Well, it's true, but this is my blog and I can whine all I want. Actually there was a pretty funny part of today.         It happened in the time directly following lunch. The actors were clearly bored and tired and the sound of the heavy rain patting against the roof filled their ears. Natalie was staging "Right Track" and the mood was strained as 20 bored people tried desperatley to focus and learn the tedious dance. Caitlin's feet hurt as she has just started breaking in her new Capezio T-strap character heels. Then suddenly, the actors heard a strange noise coming from the back of the theater, intantly gaining their attention and shattering their focus. But what was this strange noise? It took them a few seconds to figure out it was none otherthan....SAM. Yes, Sam was sitting in the back of the theater with his headphones on and his head burried in his script. His eyebrows were furrowed in deep concentration. The strange sound reaappeared and once again it took the actors a few second to realize, not only was it Sam, but that he was singing! Very loudly from the back of the theater was Sam singing "Love song.. na na na na na na na na na." over and over. Only, he was not just loud and distracting, but not even close to the right notes. It soudedmore like someone singing in the shower loudly over a radio than the lead in a local musical. The noises continued as Sam was unaware that he was being loud and distracting. Finally, James, being fed up with the childish giggles and feeling bad for Sam (or most likely, just wanting him to shut up) asked Natalie, "should I go tell him.." Interupting him Natalie answered, "No actually, I kinda like it." Then all the actors laughed appropriatley and Sam said, from the back of the theater, "Go ahead, laugh all you want." Apparently he was well aware of his singing loudly and being distracting. Although, I'm not sure he knew he was singing badly.         Sorry, I am a horribly mean and awful person. But only to Sam.. because he can take it. Basically that little story was the only fun part of my day. Other than that it was pretty tedious. Thats all. But I love Sam, I really do. And I don't know what I am going to do when him and Joe go to college. They are like my best friends right now... I don't know, whatever happens I just hope we don't lose touch. I hope I don't lost tough with anyone who goes to college. It will be so sad!  And by the way.. I AM GOING TO BE A JUNIOR NEXT YEAR!! what!? How is that fair! It feels like middle school wasn't too long ago.. and the 8th graders, they can't be SENIORS!!! This part of growing up and everyone getting older.. kind sucks. Because really.. those guys aren't seniors, and I am definatley not an upperclassmen. Ahh! Scary. And cool. I take that back.. its just cool. Haha! I'm an upperclassemen. (This is the point in the entry where the reader stops to think to themselves.. "Hmm, is Caitlin on crack?")  Ok, I have said enough for today. And I don't have a very interesting evening planned so I doubt I will update anymore unless I get really bored.  Love Always, Caitlin  PS- Leave a comment!

       Wow, it's August 4th... 20 days untill my birthday. Thats awesome! I havn't decided yet on a date for the party, sadly I think it is going to be after Sam leaves. There is just no time before August 18th to do it. In addition to it being just a birthday party, it will also be a "Welcome to America Mariatina!" party. I want to give her time to rest and adjust at least a litttle before she meets my crazy friends.  Rehersal wasn't bad today. We FINALLY finished act one. Thank God. We still havn't done the "With You" dance, which is good because my pointe shoes just came in the mail today. I don't want to have to sew them tonight thought. Anyway I hope I don't make a complete fool of myself doing an enitre pointe dance.. I am still not very strong in the ballet area. And Natalie has never done pointe so I don't know if she will be able to make the technical corrections I will need. Man I am nervous. We learned the tecet for Glory today and that is a fun dance. Except for the fact the my hat kept falling off and it didn't work at all. I have already practiced it tonight but I don't remember the order of all the moves. By the way, that dance is also original Fosse choreography.. lifted straight from the video by Jen and Natalie. But mostly Jen. Pippin will be a good show if all the pieces fall together.  Richelle is coming over in an hour and we are going to finish episodes 6- 12 of season 4 of Sex in the City. Should be a good night.  Oh! Monday Paul is doing a play reading at Plenty! I am so there.. anyone know what time it is?  Thats really all I have for now.. maybe I will update this later today. Leave me a comment if you have read this I would love to hear what you have to say!  Love and God Bless, Caitlin

        I have officially become a nerd. I just spent 4 hours of my life reading some random guy's diary of his trip to Eurpoe. He had the coolest webpage and all his friends had cool weboages so i decided i want a cool webpage! I am always open to feedback.  Perhaps updating this thing (assuming I can figure out how it works) will keep me busy online.  I figured it out.  Today rehersal kind of sucked. Not for any real reason, it was just one of those long rehersals where not much gets done. All in all though I think that Pippin will be a really good show. I am just a player but I get to do a lot of fun dancing which really excites me. So far I am in the "dance break" of Magic to Do, I have a trio dance with Amanda and Jen in the middle of Glory, and a pointe dance with Amanda, Claire, and Sam for With You. Not to mention the whole show is Fosse choreography, some of it original. Natalie lifted it right off the video. So all this dancing has been keeping me on my toes! hahaha that was a dumb pun, sorry.  I went to breakfast with my mom this morning at the Tumwater Valley Bar and Grill. It was quite enjoyable. Although, somethimes she is relaly judgemental about my friends. But I still love her. She starts her new job at TriWest tomorrow. I think she is really nervous that she will hate it. I keep telling her that she won't, and I really pray that she won't too. She only left her company so that she could live here and not in Sacramento because it was too damn hard to not live with her family. So I am really praying that she doesn't think that she has made a mistake by leaving HealthNet.  And I can't stop thinking about him. It sucks. Seriously. WHY! (At this precice moment I am contemplating whether or not I put this link in my profile, and whether or not that decision affects what I write.) Yes I think I will change the subject now, for fear of total rejection and humiliation. Not that he even has my screenname.  There are no longer kids at CTE, and I miss them already. Wow, hear I am trying to impact there life when they really have just changed mine. Its funny how much you can learn from kids when you are trying to teach them. Here are some funny kid quotes: "Do you belive in Gawd? Gawd created all the aminals." That was actually said to Joe but I love it. "Caitlin! Make him turn around!" About 15 showcase girls refering to Rick and there obsession with him. "You look sexy like that Caitlin" James in front of 120 Arts Fewstival kids. Way to go. By the way, I looked "sexy" when I would put all of my hair in front of my eyes and put my sunglasses on. The kids loved it! Ahh, the simple joys. "No way, my muscles are bigger!" A five year old boy named Blue, to another five year old boy named Adam. I could go on and on, but seeing that it is 1:36, I am tired. But I won't be able to sleep. Man, I need to buy more Tylenol PM. That will solve all my problems, not that I have any real problems.. at least I'm not in Sudan.  Oh! Also today, Richelle came over and we watched the first 5 episode of Season 4 of Sex in the City. Good show, good company, the good life. She is coming over tomorrow to finish the other DVD she rented. Thank the Lord for Richelle.  I believe that is all I have to say. And If it isn't, I can just add another post.
