      The pain is finally sinking in....I can no longer get up from sitting w/out help....but I would never give it up for the world.&nbsp; Band, next to TSA, is my passion, I love the feeling of pride when I step&nbsp;out onto that football field....this years show is going to be awesome, we have really bonded as a band/section and everybody is so good at marching (er,we're still working on the playing....that takes some time though).&nbsp; I can't wait for the first competition!

      Artist/Band: Alan Jackson  Lyrics for Song: Chattahoochee  Lyrics for Album: Greatest Hits Collection  &nbsp;  Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee  It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie  We laid rubber on the Georgie asphalt  We got a little crazy but we never got caught  &nbsp;  Down by the river on a friday night  A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight  Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women  Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute  Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee  Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me  But I learned how to swim and I learned how I was  A lot about livin' and a litttle 'bout love  &nbsp;  Well we foged up the windows in my old chevy  I was willing but she wasn't ready  So a settled for a burger and a grape sno-cone  Dropped her off early but I didn't go home  &nbsp;  Down by the river on a friday night  A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight  Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women  Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute  Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee  Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me  But I learned how to swim and I learned how I was  A lot about livin' and a litttle 'bout love  &nbsp;  Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee  It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie  We laid rubber on the Georgie asphalt  We got a little crazy but we never got caught  &nbsp;  Well we foged up the windows in my old chevy  I was willing but she wasn't ready  So a settled for a burger and a grape sno-cone  Dropped her off early but I didn't go home  &nbsp;  Down by the river on a friday night  A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight  Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women  Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute  Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee  Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me  But I learned how to swim and I learned how I was  A lot about livin' and a litttle 'bout love  &nbsp;  LOL!! I went tubeing down the Chattahoochee River last Saturday!&nbsp; It was awesome....Helen, GA is the coolest place I have ever been.

      Well, yesterday we were told that the hurricane was coming here, but when I woke up this morning, the path had moved, closer towards the beach.  Thats good news. Now that the evacuations of the coastline has started, people are coming here, in fact our band room is a red cross shelter.  The Camden/Sumter area still is expected to get 1-3 inches of rain, and we are under a tornado watch right now.  People are making such a big deal about this!  This is nothing like what it was like when I lived in south Florida, we actually got the hurricane damage.  Camden hasnt been in the direct path of a hurricane since 1989.
