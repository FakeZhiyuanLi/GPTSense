      July 26 Rode with Dr. Neil today. Had 2 RDA's and one that the owner thought was a DA, but it went away because we didn't find anything. Had one with a peritonitis and the rectum was very taut instead of elastic and we could not feel any structures. Neil said it was scar tissue that had formed and with time could heal, but it reduces milk production and the owner would lose money and time on the cow, so usually they go to beef. Going to go on a Jersey herd check with him tomorrow.  July 27 Herd check today. Feeling structures much better, actually starting to be able to feel the ovaries and some structures on them. Still can't distinguish between the CL and the follicle, but at least I know what the ovaries should feel like when they are NSO. Still have the take the doctor's word for it when the cow is pregnant because I still can't feel the fetus. Neil said to try the "double membrane slip" test, but I can't feel it yet. Everyday is better, so hopefully I can feel it before the week is over. Tried palpating with the right hand too...jaja, can't really feel much of anything. Feels like mush. My left hand definitely has the sensory feel for it vs. the right hand.  July 28 Herd check with Dr. Kevin  July 29 Sick cows with Dr. Gary  July 30 Rode with Kevin to a small herd check in a flat barn, so he did it all while I figured out how the milking machine worked. We vaccinated some calves and the first one smacked me right in the face when I tattooed her. Felt like crying because it hurt! So my jaw still hurts, the worst is that she hit me on the left side and it is the right side of my mouth that hurts. I was a little worried that tomorrow I could be bruised, but I think it will be ok. Then we went to do a preg check in goats, Nubian, Alpine and La Mancha. Used the ultrasound to preg check. Very neat and finally I can recognize something else in the ultrasound other than a kidney! :) The instrument used was a real-time ultrasound and uses the concept of diagnosis by visualizing the caruncles and a small silouette of something or the fetus. Mainly we saw the caruncles and in two we could see the ribcage of the fetus, as well as the beating heart in one of them. In about 3 we could see an enlarged uterus that had fluid in it and Kevin said it was a pyometra. Makes sense. There were also about 2 false pregnancies, which were seen as an enlarged uterus, but no fetus visible. We did transabdominal scanning instead of transrectal, which you can also do.  For transabdominal the doe must be standing and you can either clip the hair, which we did not do, or just put a lot of lube on it.  The literature says that transabdominal is functional for pregnancies that are 35 days +.  Caruncles can be seen around day 30 and by 45-50 days are doughnut or c-shaped.  The goat's uterus has about 120 caruncles.

      We had the inspection reports come back last night and the only big problem seems to be a lot of wood rot.&nbsp; Mainly due to leaks in the bathrooms and the kitchen.&nbsp; No mold though, which is what can cause some worries.&nbsp; I guess Chico told Dad that if there are patches of wood rot, those can be fixed in little pieces and it is not like we have to replace the whole piece (of wall or roof or whatever).&nbsp; Still, I know Sandi won't like it and won't want to pay any of the repairs.&nbsp; Whatever, she can do whatever she wants.&nbsp; So when I win the lottery (in my dreams)&nbsp;I will pay off my house, Dad's house, give her back what she paid for the house and then be able to concentrate on repairs.&nbsp;  I guess there are more inspections to be had later this week, so we shall se how that goes....

      So we went to Chico on the 20th to look at houses, actually Dad and I had gone earlier to get an idea of what we were getting into.&nbsp; On the 20th we already had a list of houses to look at, a real estate agent, and DJ and his parents came up too to make some final decisions.  Saw 2 houses that were just great.&nbsp; The first one was on Palm Ave. and was just the most darling little storybook house that I fell in love with.&nbsp; Kept well, huge yard, but only 2 bd, 1 ba for 219k.&nbsp; I realized that it had low rental potential, so if we were to move in now, it would have been great, but since we want to rent it out for 2 years, I guess it is not really feasable.  The second house was west of the college on Ranchita Way, 4 bd, 2 ba, huge yard, older part of town, close to orchards, needs work, but nice, going for 235k.&nbsp;  This last one actually already had 2 bids on it, but we found out that they were 100% financing, when we wanted to put 20% down.&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to go&nbsp;ahead and try to put a bid in.&nbsp; Dad wanted to have only 20 days escrow and was so excited!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Sandi and Dave went in with the financial advisor who checked credit histories and all.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent&nbsp;gave the seller until that&nbsp;evening to accept and he did!&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we are in the process of buying a house and &nbsp;waiting for reports to be made. The idea is that we buy this house now and put it for rent for 2 years, during which it should pay for itself.&nbsp; Dad has offered to come up with some of the difference if it is difficult to rent.&nbsp; Sandi is really worried about the financing of this house.&nbsp; I guess she was hesitant about it at first, which is understandable because she is helping Ryan with rehab and her mom with paying for her hip replacement surgery, but also annoying because my Dad is so interested in our future and it is such Actually we had the initial inspection come in late last week, like on Thursday and it came back clear on termites, but there is dry rot in several areas.&nbsp; Sandi is freaking out about it being toxic and worried about repair expenses.&nbsp;
