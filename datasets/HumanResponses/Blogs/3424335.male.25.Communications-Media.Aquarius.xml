      This one's local. The Mountain Press in Sevierville (circulation 10,000 daily and Sunday) pushes through a content-based redesign. I've e-mailed the editor to get more details about how this new look came to be and I will post anything he sends my way. BTW, they are looking for a page designer.

      With a $1,500 signing bonus on the table, union members at the Knight-Ridder-owned Akron Beacon-Journal still may look to take to the streets.   Management's "best-and-final" offer is a four-year agreement that includes no raise the first year and a 1 percent pay hike each of the following three years. The paper would increase each Guild member's share of health care premiums, from 14 percent to 22 percent for single employees and 30 percent for those under the family plan, which has some members highly aggravated.

      The Houston Chronicle is phasing in its new look this week. Roger Black was the consultant. There isn't a link to the new pages though, just some talk about adding color to sections and being bolder with photography. As soon as we get some examples, I'll post them here.

      Yet another fine example of skewed priorities in our schools. So instead of reading the story in the school paper, pick up the local daily instead.

      Snippets from a Westword article on the Denver Post's recent redesign:   Remake and remodel: Luck was on the side of the folks who oversaw the Post's redesign.  Because the paper has looked so crappy for so long, there was nowhere to go but up.  For that reason, it's no shock that the new-look Post is a significant improvement. A relief, definitely, but not a shock.   Ouch. The story is a couple of weeks old but also touches on some Post newsroom shuffling as well.   The paper's style is a little too reserved for my tastes (the Post preferred to have a "quiet conversation" with its readers over breakfast, AME/Presentation Damon Cain told me). For $160 per year, I like my newspaper to slap me around in the morning. The Post's feature sections do that. They are a nice change of pace.  To see the new Denver Post, click on "Today's Front Pages" or go to "NPD.com" to check out the staff portfolio.

      Design trend-setting pubs in Fort Lauderdale, Corpus Christi and Savannah are looking for designers.  Beach jobs rule.   Charlotte and Orlando aren't that far from the beach and are kick-ass visual papers. Guess what? They also have openings.  Polish up the cover letter, redesign the resume and prepare the portfolio.

      One of the main reasons we're in this business: self-sacrifice. I've added a new link under "Careers" that shows newsroom and other salary scales at union newspapers. The top minimum for years of experience is noted.  This doesn't mean the newspaper won't/can't pay you more, but this is the least amount allowed by the newsroom contract.   Some of the 114 publications you'll find there:  Baltimore Sun Boston Globe   Chicago Sun-Times   Cleveland Plain Dealer Denver Rocky Mountain News Detroit News   Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Minneapolis Star Tribune   New York Times Philadelphia Inquirer Pittsburgh Post-Gazette San Jose Mercury-News Seattle Times St. Louis Post-Dispatch Washington Post

       Adding layers to your pages is an essential part of news design. Here's how we tackle breakouts at the News Sentinel:    FOCUSING ON CONTENT, NOT JUST COSMETICS  The success of any newspaper rests with its content. With news hole continuing to shrink, coupling non-narrative with stories helps alleviate gray areas while adding layers of information for readers. As designers, we can enhance our pages by taking extra time to add additional content. While non-narrative isn't enough to make an award-winning page, when married to solid stories and design, the results are spectacular.   What is non-narrative?  Essentially, it's content that's not presented in story fashion. It usually comes in four categories:  1. Info boxes 2. Refers 3. Listings 4. Display type  The most common is the info box.   What makes a successful info box?  Non-narrative information offers quick additional information to a story. Info boxes aren't a story or narrative sidebar, no matter how short, or a brief or number of briefs. They can have, but are not limited to, these types of information:  — Bio, company and/or stock information, salaries, perks — Addresses, phone numbers, Web sites, information for more help — Event information — How-to tips, dos & don'ts, helpful hints — Lists, comparisons, examples   Some examples:   Innovation/Imagination: 50 years of Polaroid Photography — Where: Pittsburgh Museum of Art — When: Opens Friday, Aug. 16. Continues through Nov. 17 — Admission: $10 for adults, $7 for children 12 and under  Automobile trends — Easier and larger interiors: Foldable or removable back seats. Interiors that are made of plastic for easy cleaning with the water hose. — Wired to the max: Prewired to accomodate your MP3 player, portable DVD player and your laptop. — A different view: Sun roofs that open for passengers in the backseat Source: Auto Age   Info box words of advice  — For headlines, avoid phrases such as "At a glance," "By the numbers," or "Facts." Use more content-oriented phrases that summarize the info box (i.e., How to boil water, City of Lights Festival).  — If you need an explanatory paragraph for the info box (and many times you won't need one if you are careful with your headline selection), avoid phrases such as "Here are the ...," "Here is the list ...," "The following are examples of ..." Many times these are redundant to the headline.  — Always source your material  — Don't recycle information that's already present in the story; use fresh material or make it a summary box   Easy ways to find non-narrative  — Associated Press, wire services: Often the wire will move Glance boxes. If there's not a glance, check for an AP graphic. Even if you don't have room for a large graphic, edit the material down and format it, with or without icons.  — Mine your stories: Explore ways to expand a particular angle, maybe something that would work visually, such as a comparison box.  — Internet: Reputable Web sites such as historychannel.com, infoplease.com, etc.

      The Tennessean will unveil a new look this fall. Memphis is currently undergoing some changes. Knoxville pulled back the curtain on a new look last year. Anyone else have a redesign planned? Let us know about it.  In that vein, the Tennessean is looking for a visual expert:  http://www.snd.org/jobs/jobs.lasso?ID=37105

      Sounds like a disgrunted employee to me. Normally I'll just post links to stories, but this is a classic read. Thanks to Charles Apple at VisualEditors.com for making it available.   Story courtesy of the Associated Press   MIAMI -  The Miami Herald is demanding that Internet provider Yahoo! reveal identities of three subscribers accused of sending e-mails to the newspaper's employees containing "malicious and defamatory statements" about its management.   The Herald wants the identities of the three people who sent e-mails to its employees between January 2002 and March of this year, according to a court petition filed Thursday in Miami.   One of the e-mails was titled "stupid management tricks" and referred to a management employee as a "Psycho," the filing alleges.   The statements expose the newspaper "to distrust, hatred, contempt, or ridicule," and have "a tendency to injure it in its office, occupation, business or employment," the filing said.   Robert Beatty, general counsel for the Herald, said he could not predict what the newspaper's next step would be if Yahoo turns over the identities.   In the filing, the newspaper said it was unable to enforce its legal rights against the individual e-mailers without their identities.   Mary Osako, senior director of communications for Yahoo, declined to comment on the case.   Yahoo does not disclose personal information without a subscriber's permission unless it is responding to a court order or if other exceptions apply, such as suspicion of illegal activity, according to the company's Web site.

      I've been asking other designers informally whether or not we should host a training seminar/roundtable discussion for our region here in Knoxville. Some of the folks from around East Tennessee are excited about this possibility. Let me know if you're interested in attending or speaking. I'm trying to line up some heavy-hitters now, so if we get enough people willing to come, we'll put it together.  E-mail me at schnick@knews.com for information.

      Akron Beacon-Journal Public Editor Mike Needs gives his take on the byline strike, a move approved by union staffers to bring attention to stalled negotiations.  From Needs' column:  Wrote Dick Freeman of Akron: ``I can see one immediate benefit: a pronounced reduction in e-mails sent by readers to staffers.''  Actually, that's no benefit.  Readers form a key part of the newspaper process. Your criticism teaches. Your comments illuminate. Your feedback sets the record straight and your suggestions result in followup articles.  For this newspaper to best serve you, your voice must be heard.   Registration is required to read the entire article.

      A great special report by our flagship paper. Thanks to design director Kathy Bogan for bringing it to my attention.   Jonathan's journey: The boy who would not die   By Robert Sanchez, Rocky Mountain News June 30, 2004  Jonathan Swain did not die.   Of all the twists in his life, that is perhaps the strangest.   He did not die when all the other children died of the plague, as it was called, the killer he named his Secret Monster.   Jonathan Swain did not die even though his mother — curled up beside him in bed, careful not to crush his oxygen tube — told him that he would.
