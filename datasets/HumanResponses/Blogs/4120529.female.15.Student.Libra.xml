        Dear Blog...      Yes today is saturday=tuition. As usual  me  and  iqah  were late AGAIN! Usually reached unityss ard 2.15 but this time 2.30pm. Lucikly there wasn't any teachers around to question us. Feeweeit today iqah dress up very preeetttttyy sia..!! Chiou Bu + Jambu. Pink summore. While making our towards cck cntrl station,bump into  yuzry,pei wei and his friend ,forgot his name. They were waiting for a friend there.      At yew tee cntrl station both of us saw  Azhar ,he told us he'll b late. He's always like that. Today everyone was there.  Jamilah, Atiqah,  Arafat,Iskandar  ,Me,  Hidayat  and  Azhar . All 7 of us. I sat next to  hidayat ,and both of us did eng compre frm the N lvl TYS. We cmplete it earlier then the rest.. so we chat bout prelim results my new hp..yes   Sony Ericsson T610  .  Dad  bought it for me. Thankies.      3.30pm all 7 of us went for our break.. we pass the sec3NA class.. pathetic sey they were all looking at us especially the girl in pink. Jam simply said    ''Aku rasa diaorg pikir kiter ni jambu sgt sebab tu kene tgk lama2''...      LOLs.. I didn't stay on for maths lesson .. I'm meeting   yuzry.      While waiting for the train at yew tee.. I saw this malay girl she's probably older than me. I'm like totally disgusted with the way she dress. She's plump and yet she's trying to fit into those teeny weeny S size top. So unsightly. Could even see her black bra strap. She wore it in a may I say wrong way?So unglamourous.    She just stared at me..while I did try to avoid any eye contact. Nvm her problem la..why do I care so much.      Meet up with  yuzry ..off to jurng east libry. To go get english novels. I miss reading. There were so many teens on level 4...duh teens place rite. I wasn't used to hearing music blasting in the library..haha. I wasn't also used to people staring at me while I'm borrowing books. I was like showing my stop- staring- at -me -larhs- idiots- face! There were tons of malays there. We grab a bite at Mac.. I pay using ezlink kekeke..  mum  top up 50 bucks. We chat for awhile and explore the place although there wasn't much to see.      Took bus 198 drop off at JP. Met his  mum..  was smiling away at me. *blush* We walk all the way to blk 680C.. where the bus-stop is.. mirul's  blk actually.. and frm there we said our gdbyes.    Oh yah  yuzry  receive a msg frm a gay person wanting to do  IT  ..lols...so funny sey.    On the way hm.. ShaSha  sms.. asking bout 2moro DVA gath. If ur're readin this. ..2moro 3pm sharp at yishun. Of couse we have to mit earlier. If late u must blaja k. Confirm k babe white top. She's playin pool with  Raf  and gang.. too bad I can't go in.. 16 and above..nvm it's ok. I'm sure the gath will be a great one.. meeting all the DVA's.   Oh yah 2dae's menu  PIZZA!!     Chatting with  Mariah  and  Sarlina  plus  Sharul .. in MSN ..so update 2moro yahh.. tatas`~

      Leaving me all alone... Don't you noe my tears will cause an inferno..?... romance up in flames,... why should i take the blame?.. You were da one who left me neglected.. apology not accepted.. add me to da broken hearts you've collected..   You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it And all the memories, so close to me, just fade away All this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending..  It's nice to know you were there Thanks to all my ex for acting like you cared And making me feel like I was the only one.. It's nice to know we had it all.. Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done...  Wish I could tie u up in my shoes and make you feel unpretty too I was told I was beautiful.. But what does that mean to you?..

       Will or will I not make it through?..       Thinking bout it just send shivers       Even if I do, can I make it or will I waste 1 precious year?   If I don't, can I accept the fact that I'll be going to ITE..   Please do not get me wrong.. I'm not saying ITE is not good..it is..   but I've always favour poly. I can imagine how heartbroken I will be..      I'm not really sure now..   Judging from my prelim results it wasn't up to my expectations..   Yes u may say it's only prelims.. yes u may say u understand my situation..   You DON'T ok.. I'm struggling my ass out producing results..   I fear my parents,siblings,cousins and friends will look down on me...   Slashing wrists, going crazy..losing sleep isn't my forte...   Do dreams  come true? For now I don't buy that..      3weeks left till N level Social Studies &  Mother Tongue Paper..   I'm definately not yet fully prepared. I'm left with 2 theme to cover..   Since having Mr Yunus as our language teacher.. I must admit my results is really pathetic . Is it his strict marking, to make us panicked or is it just me? Seriously my standard cant be THAT low. Never once in sec4  I secured A1 same goes to the rest..       Yes I am a determined girl.. so I've decided..   1. No more internet in my room ..Hide the cables ..so wont be tempted   2. Less time spent watchin TV ..kinda difficult cause the Tv is in my room.   3. Less time talking on the phone/SMS-ing   That means I won't be updating regurlarly.. I'll be using my brother's comp.       No more last min studying. I'm gonna start revision from today onwards..   Get enough rest and plenty of water..(don't wana my lips to be dry again)      Remember that there's no such thing as   ''stress''   and that it doesn't exists.      Gath this sun at yishun...   I'm not sure I'm going..   Time is very precious to me..   Hopefully I can make it yar..   Sorry DVA's..

       *woots*..I'm parking my ass infront of the screen..typing away..just got back from Lot1.. meet my dearest mummy... she's considering a transfer from Toa Payoh to CCK HDB centre. Atleast save on transport and furthermore she is still recovering frm the operation and can hardly walk.      2moro is finally the last day of prelim. Left maths paper 2 and geography elective. Damn I looked so lethargic. My lips are sooo dry and my stomach is empty. *growls*3 days of endless sleep and worries. It's really taken its toll on me. I could already see the dark circles. *boohoo* burning the midnight oil. I can't sudy in the afternoon, i prefer at night after my prayers. Funny ehks? That's me. Coffee again i guess.. I sound like a baby always whining.      Did Physics Paper 1 & 2 and F&amp;N... For physics the questions looks ancient to me. I tot it is suppose to be from N lvl TYS. I gotta know that those qns are frm O lvl TYS. wadda!! waste my time practice TYS. Hahaha.. nvm. Prelims are actually suppose to be very very very tough,but so far i could do all the papers except for english compo and ss paper. I screw up. and the fact that i'm better in english makes it even worse. Mr Zahed is gonna be sooo dispntd in me.This time round goodbye A2. Blardy! Thankfully it's not N lvls. I panicked coz I didn't really go thru F&N in detail. Luckily I could do the paper. Hopefully I can beat   Tony Seet   this time round. I need to get a distinction for F&amp;N. *cross-fingers*      I pity my bestie   Shasha  . She is so freaking stressed up right now. Yesterday she had maths tuition up to 10.30pm. By the time she go home she was too tired. She hardly touch her physics and F&amp;N. She's really pissed off and is not confident about passing both papers. Sha u can punyer. Don't worry ok. On top of that she has to study for her religious class exams.. plus geography and maths paper 2moro. Its only prelim k. Cheer up. I'm never felt so much pressure before. Pressure to do well,serves me right for going to the 1st class. Nvm .. I'll take on the challange.   I suddenly realised all my entries mostly about exams. Haiz. Btw for those of u who have been trying to contact me thru my cellphone 948221**.. Sorry yah I didn't switch ON for 3 days. My apologies.      Yesterday   Mr Zahed   inform all the 4NA'S that we are suppose to attent school after prelims, during sept holidays and after Nlevels to continue sec 5 syllabus. Mati siot gitu. No rest day uh? He added    ''unless u all are confirm u are going to ITE.. than by all means absent urself..attendance will be taken and do not start finding work yet!''.     Actually I've already plan  to get a part time job.. but heck care I'm still gonna work. It's not that I don't care about my studies but I need a break. Sec 5 next year what.. just strt nex yr la. Start a fresh...    I'm goin for facial and SPA this weekend.. anyone wanna join.. ekekeS`.. Pamper myself.

       Everday I feel so heavy...wahlau!  I get agitated over small things. I can't help it when I see skinny girls.. I mean they can fit into any clothes.. Get any guy they wants..  This is reality and I can't run away from that...It made me shudder in shame...It's not that I'm not being thankful for what I have ..But wouldn't it be better if I am abit more slimmer and smaller..Bacause of this.. I made drastic measures..Yes I admit I did vomit all my food after I ate em'..I stopped when I vomitted blood one day..It scares the hell out of me..bulimic? I did that also because i was dumped by this guy whom I was truly madly deeply in love with or so I thought...  It's unfortunate that I've inherited voluptous genes. I am happy that I've manage to lose some kilos. My weight was 68kg ..i manage to reduced it to 50kg in sec 4. However I am still not yet satisfied. Parts of the body where i wanna slim on is my arms. I feel that it is big. How i wish I got the time to go to the gym. I'm lucky that i join hockey atleast i am forced to excercise.. but then i'm not that fair as i used to be. *sobx* Shud have used sunblock. Although I'm no longer being teased .. i still feel the need to lose more weight. I  MUST.   Standing beside shasha and iqah is even more worse. Sumx i kept hating myself. Why am i like this? Why am i not like that?  I walk up the stairs .. walk home after school.. skip meals especially rice. Some of u may have noticed that I no longer eat during recess.No food after 8pm for me. If i'm hungry i'll munch on apples. I've heard of the 5day apple detox. Apples for breakfast,lunch and dinner. I do feel that I'm torturing myself. I can't help feeling insecure. Too bad I live in a so-called ''perfect'' world.. where u see skinny models in mag and tv.  Yes i do receive compliments nowadays. Even my childhood friends noticed the change. I will try not to do those stuff again but old habits are hard to die. Popping pills and slimming centres are out of the question. Temptations is another contributing factor. You knw how yummy and delicious food can be. I do feel guilty when i eat in large proportions. Atleast i have the honour of wearing baju kurung/kebaya size S instead of M. Now i need a new wardrobe coz some of the clothes are like too big for me.  Another part of my body which I am trying to learn to be grateful of having a bigger bust than some of my friends. My mum did told me u noe sum people are paying tons of money to increase the bust.. i wonder why.. She said just learn to live with it and take good care of it. ..it's God's creation. ..  Words can't bring me down.. i don't give a shit if anyone pass unkind remarks about my weight.. Hahahaha.. it's only when I see skinny and all so perfect girls..that will bring me down.!   I just wish I could appreciate and love myself more....

      Too tired to blog yesterdae..  New comp! Pentium 4 ..my elder bro jealous sey. *evil laughS* As usual tuition frm 2-5.15pm. I waited for atiqah at cck inter for lyke 20 mins. Peh lama..! We were late by 10mins as usual. Only both of us came. Azhar claimed he gt soccer tournament. Yelaa tu. Jam,hidayat,is and arafat..ntah ape jadi.  After tuition met yuzry,hafez,hairul and malek at jurng east inter. I beg atiqah to tag along. Wanted to pass yuzry his belated burdae gift. They looked worn out baru balek jamming biasela. We stop by at jrng east library. First time jejak tht place. Okla. Not that noisy as compared to civic.   Atiqah borrowed some books after that we explore the place. Not much to see actually. Then i had leave early coz i gotta meet my mum. So we said our goodbyes. On the way there.. i heard hafez calling my name .. so i turn and saw the whole lot of them running,so i stop. I ask him wad is it.. then he replied oh nothing.*BAH* Yusry was like hiding somewhere. I didn't knw whats going on. Hafez and the rest told me he likes me and wanted to knw if i have any feeling for him. I thought he was pulling my leg. He finally sit down with me and confess. He was beatin rnd the bush wen he finally confess. Yes i was suprised to hear tht. I just said oh ok..  Hafez called me at night ard 11+ ..he wanted to know wad hapen. I must admit he does have a witty sense of humour. Lama sey talk to him for 1 hour plus. At ard 1.20am ade orang call but i have no idea who it was. Private number. So i pick up he claimed he was adi and that someone gave him my number. Kirekan nak kenal-kenal la. However his voice sounds familiar. Hahaha he finally own up. He told me he lied because if not i wouldn't want to chat with him..it's not that. Sorry k.  Shasha and fahmi ask me to tag along 2moro,wtch the fireworks AGAIN. This time alot of my classmates are turning up. I decided not to go coz i need to study. Furthermore i wanna let those two lovebirds spend more time with each other. Sorry k Sha..? Do have fun ya. Later ard 1 going out with shasha and yus g bb. ..

      Slack uh 2dae.. didn't attend school.. get to wake up late.. Yesterday visit my dearest mummy.. poor thing she just had her operation. She's nt allowed to eat nor drink. It hurts not being able to do anything to make the pain go. I miss her so much. i'm wretched with guilty conscience because i never really treated her that well. I'm sorry .. i was too stressed out i didn't mean to lash out you.Forgive me. I won't ever take my loved ones for granted anymore.  Woke up 2dae..did all the housework.. sweeping..washing clothes and etc. Damn tired. Yuzry called..chat for a while. As usual both of us talk crap. he kept giving me compliments..gosh i'm lyke blushing all the way. Thanks ya. It was my ex zai burfdae today. He's 17 this yr. He was shocked i still remembered his burdae. Of course i do, i never forgt my frends burdae. May all ur wishes and dreams come true.   Someone actually a guy frend said why i never really try to dress up or look pretty in school. I replied politely saying unlike some drama queens who wear short skirts,use make up,fanciful earrings/earstud,showing off their branded bags..hahaha eh to all those who ''terasa'' too bad uh.. my purpose of going to school is to get a good education. u dun have to show tht u are pretty. I suceed actually. I look diffrent when i'm in school and when i'm outside. Yes,people claimed i don't know how to dress up, wear make up and stuff. hey they had their last laughs when they saw me last sun at esplanade. Suprised eh? I saw u all looking at me and for the fact that ur frend actually asked for my number,serves u right gerl. I'm not that thick skin. Words can't and will never bring me down. Get that in your head.
