      Since Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant made the leap into the NBA straight from high school, and were successful in doing so, high schoolers have been skipping college in record numbers year after year.  The negatives that come with these basketball players far outweigh the positives.  First off, the players are blameless.  The bottom line is if you can imagine graduating from high school and as you walk off the podium there is an agent standing there promising you between $1-4 million/year, over the next 3 years, what would you do?  Of course, this isn't introduced to you for the first time at the age of graduation. Oh Noooo...agents can't wait that long.  LeBron James was recruited since 8th grade.  What was on your mind during 8th grade?    Why is this bad?  Well, first you have to think of the kids who declare for the draft after recieving bad advice, and then never get selected. If you declare for the draft, and sign with an agent, you cannot go back to college if you are not drafted.  There have been some fabulous players in this league that have excelled in the NBA; Kobe Bryant, Jermaine O'Neil, Kevin Garnett, Tracey McGrady, to name a few.  However, there are a larger pool of players such as; D'Angelo Collins and Lamar Cook, who are touted one of "the best high school ball players in the country" who never got drafted and end up continuously trying out for random teams throughout the NBA, or worse, playing competitive ball in Turkey.  Also, if you are randomly trying out for these teams, you can get signed to 10-day contracts, and cut at anytime the team chooses.  If these players who just missed being drafted had gone to college in the first place, they probably would have been all-americans.    Another problem with jumping straight to the pro's is the coaching they recieve.  The NBA has turned into a league that exercises "coaching genecide" without breaking a sweat.  Year after year, coaches are ousted because either a player or owner demand someone is blamed for them not winning the championship.  9 out of 10 times, that finger is first pointed at the coach.  With the constant carousel of coaches leaving a team, rarely will a high school player in the NBA get the attention he needs to adjust to the vigors of the NBA.  In College, these players normally play with a coach who is going to stay with them throughout their 4 years.  This 4 year time period teaches them a higher level of basketball knowledge and better prepares them for some of the challenges of the up coming NBA.   Money is obviously the biggest problem.  David Stern blows smoke in everyones face when he says "the NBA is looking into a 20 years or older age limit". Yeah right Dave!  David Stern is sitting back sipping his carmel latte enima, watching the money pure in.  This is good for his business.  Right now the NBA is in a state of high-flyers who can dunk the ball from any spot on the court.  The game of basketball itself is being strangled.  These players don't know how to run an offense.  They have no idea how to play good defense, and now they don't even have a consistant coach to help them a long the way.  High School players do one of two things when they enter the NBA.  They either do okay for 4 years, then never play again or they don't do anything for 5-7 seasons before they finally become impact players.  Either way, at least 2 years of college will allow these guys to avoid both sinarios.  Playing in college will help these players learn more about the game of basketball.  It will teach them how to play in pressure games with a lot on the line.  No matter what anyone says, playing for the National Championship is irreplaceable.   Another problem which is not helping this issue, ego's.  The General Managers of these teams try their best to select the highschool player that makes them look like a genius.  They want to say they told you so.  When in fact, no one knows how these kids are going to turn out.  Kwame Brown was the first ever high schooler to be selected No.1 in the draft.  He was supposed to be the next great center in the league.  He hasn't done a damn thing.  Will he in time, maybe.  However, he was projected to make the Wizards elite among it's competition.  On the other end of the spectrum, Rashard Lewis, is a kid from Highschool, who plays for Seattle and has had a pretty consistant, solid NBA career thus far.  Point being, not a lot of people expected much from Lewis going into the league and he has been 10 times as productive as Kwame Brown.  The scouts, agents, coaches etc. have NO idea how these players are going to work out.  But that is not going to stop them from being drafted.  As a result, college basketball will continue to lose great players, the NBA will continue to decline with regards to quality, and the worst part is these high school players who have dedicated their life to this game only to recieve bad advice; declare for the draft, miss college, the NBA, and life in the US, because they are playing through the night for some bankrupt team in Thailand.     by John Merschel

      With draft night steadily approaching, fans from all over are wondering the NBA fate of Jameer Nelson.  And why not?  Afterall, he is the man the SI labeled 'the little man from the little school, who is beating everyone in the country'.  He is one of the classiest acts to come out of College Basketball.  Jameer lead a great basketball program deep into the tourney, all while proving to the country that he is the best PG.  St. Joes, the city of Philadelphia, Big 5 fans, bball fans all around the country love Jameer Nelson.  Of course, since he is from Philadelphia, isn't the 76ers the best fit for Jameer and Jameer the best fit for the 76ers?  Unfortunately not.    I think that Jameer Nelson is going to do very well in the NBA.  I think that he is going to play a very valuable role for a team that has a need at the guard spot.  Let's look at why this would be bad for the Sixers?  You already have a long term contract to a "consistant at best" pg and a star in Allen Iverson, where if he plays the point (Obrian has already said he is going to try this) you are set at that position.  If you go and get someone who is around 6'8", runs the court, can shoot pretty well from the outside, and be a presence on the inside, that would be a good fit.  Or, you can go bigger and draft someone who is 7'0", a little light when comparing to big men, but still adds size down low and a decent mid-range game, again you have a fit.  There will be a player available at the 9 pick who has an opportunity to be an immediate impact on this team, or a better fit towards their future.  Jameer Nelson, as fantastic as he was throughout college, is not going to have the impact he potentially could have for another team.  The Sixers have management problems, salary cap issues, broken down players, bad attitudes, and a very very slim chance at making the playoffs.  Why would we want Jameer to come here?    Secondly, why is the Sixers not a good fit for Jameer and what team would be a good fit?  Jameer Nelson has the ability, knowledge and attitude that coaches are in love with.  He is a true PG who knows how to play the position and has the desire and thirst to learn more.  I think the best fit for Jameer is the NJ Nets or the Miami Heat.  Both teams are targeting him, and one of them should land him on draft night.  If he plays for the Nets, he will obviously have the ability to learn from one of the best PG's in the game, Jason Kidd.  Nelson will have the ability to go through the motions of being a rookie, he will learn so much by going against Kidd throughout practice.  He will be a part of a young, talented team on the up.  If Jameer Nelson comes out and has a superstar year for the Sixers, they still won't make the playoffs.    Do you want to be realistic Sixer fans?  Do you want Jameer Nelson?  Ok, here is what we do.  Take the next 3 years, and handle your business.  Get out from underneath these bad contracts, change your management, create cap room, trade Iverson etc.  Re-Establish your footing in this league and start your way back to the top.  The scary part about the Sixers is they still are on their way to rock bottom.  Grabbing Jameer Nelson and taking him with us is not the answer.  Let Jameer play his rookie, 3-year contract and then target him when that contract is over (if that is even an option).  Drafting players is a dangerous time to let personal feelings influence your pick.  However, if you Love Jameer, and want what is best for him, let it go.  This is not the best situation for Jameer, or any player for that matter, to come in to.

      The Phillies today reassigned Marlon Byrd to Scranton and Manager Larry Bowa stated that he would play Doug Glanville and Jason Michaels in Byrd's place in centerfield.Wow! That will really improve the Phillies' chances of winning The NL East!!!!! Byrd was batting .224 when he got on the bus this morning. Glanville is currently batting .212 and Michael's is slapping the ball at a .244 clip. Not to worry because Bowa recalled Shawn Wooten from Scranton. He's coming back to the big club to try and improve on the .179 BA that he left here last time he was up.We got better did'nt we??? As a rookie last year Byrd was a serious candidate for Rookie of the Year,batted over .300 and played an aggressive and somewhat adventurous centerfield.Bowa admits that Byrd may be the hardest worker on the team.What is he going to prove in Scranton?? That he can hit AAA pitching???? No disrespect to Glanville or Michaels but it has already been established that their manager does not believe that either one can be offensively effective on a daily basis. So Bowa figures----HMMMMM---- If I have 2 guys who cannot play everyday maybe that equals 1 guy who can. O.K.-- looks like Bow and Vuke will huddle on this concept and ,maybe see the light. Right and maybe Bowa will come to a press conference after a loss and shake his 4th grade demeanor, look the reporters in the eye and give them reasonable answers to reasonable questions.

      Jayson, Jayson, Jayson.  Well, it looks like once again you can fire a gun, cause damage, and get away with it.  Congratulations, you are famous.    Jayson Williams, at one point in life, was the class of the NBA (Believe it or not).  Roughly about 10 years ago, when he was playing in his prime, Jayson got into a heated debate with Charles Barkley over the salaries of Professional Athletes.  Charles Barkley contested that 'with all the money people make off of pro athletes, we, as athletes are underpaid.'  Jayson Williams fires right back and states one of the best lines to come out of an athletes mouth 'I'm tired of debating whether or not Athletes are overpaid or not.  This is such a pointless topic to discuss.  OF COURSE we are overpaid.  End of discussion.  It's not going to change, in time we are going to be even MORE overpaid.  Since none of this is going to change, why are we debating it?' Williams was also well known for using his fame and fortunes in other venues as well.  He started his own builders company, gave tons of money to charities, and employed/boarded many underpriveledged citizens of his community.  Thank you Jayson Williams for giving back.     In 1994, Williams was in a parking lot, showing off a new pistol that he recently purchased.  He turned to the side and 'accidently' fired a bullet into an unoccupied car. The judge forced him to go to highschools and do PSA's about gun safety.  This makes some sense, use his celebrity status for something good.  A few years later, he is in his back yard with a few friends, standing on his shooting range test firing a new gun.  The cool thing about his weapon of choice this day was the fact that the bullets were .50 Cal.  In lay terms, they were some really big bullets that would put a rather large hole through anything/anyone it comes in contact with. As the men shoot the gun, Jayson begins a conversation with one of the on-lookers.  He is holding the gun, while he is turned around talking to his friends.  As one of the other members of the group leans over to look at one of the shells that was just fired, Williams 'accidentally' fires another round which misses Jason Seyhorn's head (the man looking at the shell) by a matter of inches.   The blast is so powerful, and so close to Seyhorn, it knocked him out cold.  One witness was so scared that it was an attempt to kill him, he started running away.  No repruccusions of this insidant. Actually, he bragged about how funny it was in his autobiography. (this is before the William Christofi incident)   Which brings us to William Christofi.  William Christofi was the limo driver who brought Williams and friends back to his house after an event.  While touring the house, Williams decides to show off his shotguns.  As he is pointing it around, he 'accidentaly' fires a round which doesn't barely miss...it kills him.  Then Williams brings everyone in the room downstairs, and tells them to act like they saw nothing.  Williams takes the shotgun and places it in Christofi's hand in a shameful attempt to make it look like a suicide.     After everything that surrounds this story including; the previous 'accidents', murder of Christofi, testimony of the house guest (who testified towards Williams attempt to cover-up everything), the most severe charges are dropped and all Legal analyst believe that he is not going to serve any jail time and rather just get some probation.  Lady Luck ran out for Jayson  Williams.  There have been at least 3 times he has almost killed someone.  Since he has only succeeded once, he is gets probation.  Congratulations Jayson, you are a famous, rich athlete.     What time do you and OJ tee-off?

      For those of you who follow the NBA closely, you know the draft is coming up this week.  It is always my pleasure to find all the in-depth scouting each team is going through.  If you have a question about your favorite team, let me know.  I will answer posts before the draft begins on Thursday night.  (I love throwing questions out to the crowd that doesn't exist)

      Congratulations to the Detroit Pistons for winning the NBA championship.  First off, I would like to say that myself, along with 99% of the sports watching world, picked the Lakers.  Or, should I say Fakers.  Hind sight is always 20/20, and it is so easy to see how the Pistons won.  They are a young, hungry, well-coached team which walked into LA, slappled the Lakers around and never looked back.    The Pistons put together a blueprint designed for winning, and that's what they did, they won.  First, they bring in the best active coach in the league today.  Larry Brown is known for taking teams and making them do better than they did in previous years. There has always been one glaring problem however.  Larry Brown has rarely had a good team to start with.  The last team he took to the finals was a highly over-achieving Sixers team that had one superstar and 4 guys named Joe.  They ran into the Lakers in 2001 and were beaten in 5 games.  This Detroit team is completely different.  They played well as a team.  They played with more intensity and heart then the Lakers could have played in 100 game series.    It's almost more fun to analyze the way the Lakers lost and what exactly was at stake (Takes deep breath).  First, the "Zen" man.  Give me a break.  All you ever read about is Phil Jackson's master of the Zen, and how he has his team centered and focused.  Hey Phil, how about you uncross your legs, stand-up, and I don't know...ummm...COACH a game.  Quit relying on the fact that you have one of the best skilled players (kobe) and the most dominating player (shaq) on your team, and TEACH these men how to win!  Just because this team has won before doesn't mean they are going to keep doing it over and over.  The Pistons adjusted to the way the Lakers played.  This was due to great coaching by Brown.  However, after 4 games of getting whooped, you would think Phil would wake up and realize he has to change his plan.  The point where I realized the Fakers were not going to win was after game 3, and the series was 2-1.  For three straight games, Shaq was unstoppable.  However, the ego of Kobe kept him from going to what worked.  Kobe would rather try his best to win the championship on his back versus, doing what works and continuing to make the Pistons find a way to stop the big man in the middle(that and Larry knew how to take advantage to Malone's injury).  Oh well, was it worth it Kobe?  Brown simply adjusted the way his team played and it appeared that the Pistons set a new record for the number of Lay-ups they had in one series.    There has been a lot of discussion over the fact that much of the country wanted LA to lose. Why?  Is it because people don't like dynasty's anymore?  Is it because all of hollywood is a lakers fan?  Is it because of Kobe Bryant?  Let's look at the options.  If the Lakers won, chances are they would stay together as a team and contend for another championship next year.  Since the lakers lost, it is pretty evident Phil Jackson is not going to be back.  Shaq said that he does not want to reuturn if Phil is not back.  Kobe has lead us to believe that he would rather play for a team like the Clippers, so his basketball ego can stretch out.  Gary Payton is not going to opt out of his contract, so he will stay with a team that doesn't want him, and Malone will probably retire.  Which sounds more exciting to you? What if Shaq found a way to get traded to the Magic?  Or Kobe played for Denver?  Are the Lakers the type of team that likes to rebuild?    In case you are wondering, yes, the NBA does follow the same story line as a soap opera.    Congrats again to Larry Brown and the Pistons.

      Well, as many of the 10's upon 10's of Johnny's Rant followers know , I am getting married next week.  What a great time to reflect on the Sports State of the Union.  This is a great time because we are near the middle of the baseball season.  While sports channels scrammble to sell their air time to Full Contact Karate and Cheerleading competition RERUNS, there really is no more boring time of the year for sports than now.    I am off to Hawaii after I get married, and between the wedding, travel and vacation, I will not keep up with sports for some time. Copeing will be difficult.  Anyway, when i return a certain smell will be back in the air.  The smell of blood, sweat and tears.  The smell of speed, anger, power, and pain will be all around.  Yes folks, we will be approaching football season.  Ahh, football season.  Hands down, the sport that rules the U.S..  Yes my friends, football season is not too far away.  Back to the State of the Sports Union.  From a business standpoint, I would have to think that business has never been better.  Athletes have taken their fame and turned it into fashion, music and movies.  This in turn, helps the sport itself.  However, as quoted from one of my favorite movies "on a long enough time line, the survival rate for anything is zero percent".  Hockey is about to go on strike.  Why?  Well, I am not the smartest of business men, however hockey brings in about $1.6 billion annualy, and players salary cost about $1.4billion.  The fan base does not support the amount of money teams are paying their stars.  The season is too long, and it is still a sport that many people don't get.  I love hockey.  However, a hockey season can often be similar to a nascar race, you can watch the beginning, leave for 3 months, come back and there is no change in the positioning.  The people who are hurt the most by this?  Hockey fans.  Hockey fans are great because they know that most of the country doesn't like hockey, and they don't care.  It's their sport, and that's that.    Baseball is under a contract with it's players, but that won't last long.  The players will petition for a new contract, and when they don't get it, they will strike.  A perfect example of how bad things are with them is Alex Rodriguez. A-Rod, is one of the best players in the league.  Before he signed with the Yankees this season, he signed a $225 million contract with the Rangers.  This contract included a huge sign on bonus and a $25 million per year salary.  Now, if that isn't enough for one man, he had to add what they call an "escalator" clause.  This means, that if anyone makes more money then him on a new contract, his salary will go X Percentage above theirs so he remains the highest paid player in the league.  Without a hard salary cap, teams like the Yankees can continue to have a billion dollar payroll and players can continue to make obscene amounts of money.  Who suffers the most here?  The baseball fans.  Why?  Ticket prices continue to climb, corporations are sponsoring the building of new stadiums, which in turn jacks up the prices more.  Kids who listen to their fathers tell them glory day stories of going to the ball park to watch a game, now have an addendum added to the story, and that is the $50 tickets and the $7.00 hot dogs.  In time, fans will stop going because they can't afford it anymore, but the seats will still be filled with businessmen on their cell phones, closing deals as the bottom of the 9th tie game is happening in front of them.    Basketball is in as much, if not more trouble than baseball.  The basketball season is a good one.  It moves relatively quickly, and the athleticism is even more apparent then previously mentioned sports because it is an easier game to follow (at least easier than hockey).  I wrote about the decline of the NBA in a previous article, and this decline will continue.  The NBA makes another, smoke blowing attempt at slowing the money down by instilling a "luxury tax", knowing good and well that some teams are so rich, they will take the penalty if it means they can stack their roster.  Again, smaller market teams have an even less chance, and guess who suffers?  That's right, the fans (are you seeing a pattern?)  Ticket prices are climbing every year.  It sickens me to see all the true basketball fans sitting in the nose bleeds and the lower sections filled with movie stars who don't know the team on the court.    Then there is football.  I'm not saying that football doesn't have some problems, but let me tell you something, Paul Tagliabue (Commisionner) has kept this league running, and running well.  There have not been any strikes or lock-outs under his tenure.  Also, the attendance has remained consistant and the seasons get better and more exciting every year.  It is easy to follow your favorite team.  Schedules are easy to follow.  Probably the one question that almost every person in the world knows is what day the superbowl is played on.  That's right, Superbowl Sunday is on almost everyones calender.  Football is a difficult sport to trade players, which help players remain loyal to a team for a longer time period (which in this day and age is rare).  Football has not cheesed up the game to make money.  All they have done is increased technology to make the best parts of the game better.  For example, you don't see them putting red dots in the football so you can see where it is at all times.  Football is on it's way folks.  For the die hard baseball fans out there, enjoy this time.  In a matter of about 6 weeks, things around the sports union and website for that matter, are going to heat up....and this guy CAN't WAIT.......  Aloha Amigo's.....See you in a few weeks.....(be sure to check out my site in a couple hours, because I am going to list things that you can look for when I return and football season begins!)

      Hello, I'm back. Well, the wedding and honeymoon were fantastic. Now let's move onto some sport rants.  Welcome to Athens? Has anyone other than myself noticed that 99% of the games being played have absolutely no fans in the seats? I personally love watching the olympics. For most sports, the Olympics is the ultimate goal, you can't really go pro in Table Tennis or Sychronized Diving.  Speaking of Olympics? What's up with the Dream Team? Are you kidding me? Some of our best NBA stars got slapped by Puerto Rico on Sunday. The US took about 25 shots from 2o' away, and managed to hit 3 of them?  It's the beginning of football season, and the usual band waggon hoppers are already jumping ship (or should I say, Wagon). To everyone who has someone in their life whose blood pressure jumps about 100 pts when footbacll season begins and their team loses a presseason game, help them to relax. They need to realize that it is Pre-Season. There is one stat this is important during pre-season, and that's injuries. How many players on your team were injured?  Vijay Singh won his 2nd tourney in 2 weeks, to propel himself to the number one ranked golfer in the world.........Great. Moving on....  For the third time, this Ranter has heard that Wake Forest is going to open the season ranked No. 1 in Basketball. Well, my dad told me 2 years ago, that  this  year(2004-2005 season)they are going to be a really good/competitive team. Let's see if he was capable of seeing that far into the future. (note to public: if you make a prediction to me, I will remember it....and if you are wrong, I will let you know as well as if you are right. I am still looking for the guy I went to highschool (1995) with who predicted that Shaun Bradley will be in the NBA all-star game by the year 2000). Personally, I think that UNC is going to have something to say about this. It should be a great year in the ACC.  Wanna hear something funny? Playboy asked Terrell Owens in an interview, if he felt Jeff Garcia was gay? Owens responded "if it looks like a rat, and it smells like a rat, then by golly, it's a rat". Because of that answer, a gay activist called him a bigot. ....ummmm, ok. moving on....  Back to Wake Forest, it looks as if Tyson Claybo (OL for WF) is going to be on the practice squad with the Denver Broncos. I'll keep you posted on any information that changes, because I know you are all concerned. (remember...my site, I put on it what I want...: ) .....  In legal news, it seems as if Kobe's accuser is going to drop the case against the pro star, this is primarily due to the information that was submitted in court that the accusser actually had intercourse with another man later on the same night in question.  For all of you who still think he is guilty, you can still take solice in the fact that the mere accusation of Rape probably cost him $100 Million (say that out loud....$100 Million).  My last and final note deals with a sensitive subject in sports.  College recruiting and Violations.  The NCAA is cracking down on a different school every month it seems, and I am sick of reading about it.  If people break the rules, then they should be held accountable.  In my opinion we need to address the rules which are broken.  For example, what happened at Baylor last year?  One player was murdered.  Another player committed the homicide.  A coaching staff and administration attempted to cover up the whole crime, which was later revealed in a taped conversation by an assistant coach.  Obviously, this  is a tragedy in many respects.  However, when the NCAA came out and suspended Baylor, I was shocked at the reasons.  There were the obvious citations, however they also listed; having too many players at a dinner with a recruit, giving game tickets to the parents of a recruit, paying for food on a recruiting trip (basically the coach took his family out to dinner to talk over dinner, then picked up the tab...whooopie!!). I mean, let's get real.  There is a murder and a cover up, the lives of many people is completely ruined, and you are going to hold them accountable for buying a meal for someone?  Loosen up NCAA.  You can go to every school in the country and find similar Secondary Violations, is it really worth it?       Thats all for now.....johnny
