        Saint Ignatius was born in 1491 at Loyola in Cantabria. He spent his early years at court and as a soldier. Later he was converted to God and undertook theological studies at Paris where he attracted his first followers, and afterward at Rome he joined them together as the first members of the Society of Jesus. He exercised a most fruitful apostolate both by his written works and in the training of his disciples who won great praise for their renewal of the Church. He died at Rome in 1556.           Almighty Father, you gave Saint Ignatius of Loyola to your Church to bring greater glory to your name. May we follow his example on earth and share the crown of life in heaven. Amen. ( from the  Liturgy of the Hours).

        Saint Peter was born about the year 380 at Imola in Emilia and there entered the priesthood.  He was elected bishop of Ravenna in 424 and instructed his flock by his learned sermons and writing.  He died around the year 450.            Almighty Father, you made Peter Chrysologus an outstanding preacher of your incarnate Word.  May the prayers of Saint Peter help us to cherish the mystery of our salvation and make its meaning clear in our love for others.  Amen.  (from the Liturgy of the Hours)

        I should take the class myself, because I didn't know&nbsp;how to ask that question in Latin.  &nbsp;    Patrick Keleher, a lecturer in philosophy at North Park University&nbsp;in Chicago, will be teaching a little of the classical tongue beginning in mid-September.&nbsp; Here is his description:  &nbsp;     Starting Saturday, September 18, North Park University’s Institute for International & Cultural Affairs offers you and like-minded lifelong learners a chance finally to "get around to it."   Consider signing up for our Introduction to Latin program.&nbsp; It’s noncredit: no quizzes or tests, no pressure, just twelve congenial eighty-minute sessions -- a delightful way to spend part of your Saturday mornings with fellow Latin Lovers from all walks of life.&nbsp;   For only $150 (less than $10 per instructional hour) you can be well on your way to translating original Latin authors.&nbsp; You'll find out whether caveat emptor really means "the cave is empty," whether carpe diem means "carp is the catch of the day," and whether cogito ergo sum means "I'm just a cog in the wheel."&nbsp;              And for Latin Lovers who studied the language some time ago, this is a student-friendly refresher based on the famous Wheelock’s Latin, a time-tested method for learning Latin quickly, confidently.         Please join us for twelve lively Saturday sessions.&nbsp; And please spread the word about Introduction to Latin.&nbsp; Even though registration isn't until the first night of class, please give me an early "heads up" if you're thinking about “going Roman” with us.           &nbsp;    Email Mr. Keleher at  urlLink pkeleher@northpark.edu .

        Saint Martha was a sister of Mary and Lazarus.&nbsp; When she received the Lord as a guest at Bethany, she looked after him with devoted attention.&nbsp; She begged the Lord to raise her brother, Lazarus, from the dead.        &nbsp;     Almighty Father, you Son honored Saint Martha by coming to her home as a guest.&nbsp; By her prayers may we serve Christ in our brothers and sisters and be welcomed by you into heaven, our true home.&nbsp; Amen.

        A good friend has just put me on to an exciting new initiative at Sacred Heart Parish in Lombard that they are calling the  Commission for the New Evangelization .&nbsp; As part of their inspiration for this project, they quote Pope John Paul II from  Redemptor Hominis:           &nbsp;     "…the Church’s fundamental function in every age, and particularly in ours, is to direct man’s gaze, to point the awareness and experience of the whole of humanity toward the mystery of Christ."           &nbsp;    One can also hear the words of Christ in the Great Commission:       &nbsp;    "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,&nbsp;teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age."       Matthew 28: 19-20        &nbsp;    Every month from September through next May, the parish is hosting an outstanding array of speakers, including George Weigel, Jeff Cavins, Scott Hahn, Fr. Mitch Pacwa, and Peter Kreeft.        &nbsp;    Check out the Web site:  urlLink http://www.newevangelization.net/ .

        Barack Obama, the next senator from the State of Illinois, has just completed his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp; As a Catholic with conservative political opinions, I will find it hard to be excited about Mr. Obama's candidacy and nearly impossible to vote for him.&nbsp; And I am greatly disappointed that no good Republican candidate is running against him, or probably will.        &nbsp;    Nevertheless, Mr. Obama appears to be a principled man of great passion and devotion.&nbsp; May God guide his steps.

        And, in its decision, it made this beautiful statement:   "[W]e have found nothing in the Constitution that forbids this policy judgment. Thus, any argument that the Florida legislature was misguided in its decision is one of legislative policy, not constitutional law. The legislature is the proper forum for this debate, and we do not sit as a super-legislature to award by judicial decree what was not achievable by political consensus."      urlLink   http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=31083        Would that the Supreme Court&nbsp;thought and acted this way.

        From an ancient tradition, going back even to the second century, the parents of the Virgin Mary are known by the names of Joachim and Ann.&nbsp; Devotion to Saint Ann is found in the sixth century in the East, and by the tenth century it was widespread in the West.&nbsp; Saint Joachim was likewise honored, but at a&nbsp;more recent date.        &nbsp;     God of our fathers, you gave Saints Joachim and Ann the privilege of being the parents of Mary, the mother of your incarnate Son.&nbsp; May their prayers help us to attain the salvation you have promised to your people. &nbsp; (from the Liturgy of the Hours)

        From a friend:          Father Mike Pennock at Assumption Catholic Church, 245 South Kankakee Street, Coal City, IL, 815-634-4171 hosts  Flicks with Father.  Father always shows great features in the parish center which has a projection TV. Popcorn and drinks are available for a donation. This is a great evening of Catholic family entertainment, safe for the whole family. Father holds these every month or every other month as a great counter-balance to the movies being shown at the theatres. The next one is 8/28/04 at 7pm. Please let everyone know. For those of you not in the area, perhaps your local pastor would be interested in starting something like this.

        Bishop Theoteknos of Livias, in Palestine,  a full 1,350 years  before the dogma of the Assumption was defined by the Church, delivered a homily on this reality. Here is a portion:          "For if he has blessed his saints with the whole kingdom of heaven, if he opened paradise to a thief with a single word, how much more would he have been eager to welcome the one who made him a home in her womb--the one whom he had created, whom he had formed, from whom he became flesh, as he willed. .          "He has glorified her, the holy and all-beautiful one, the venerable one worthy of all joy, Mother and Virgin, holy and spotless. . .          "So the immaculate body of the all-holy one, and her pure soul, in which God took delight, were taken up to heaven with an escort of angels. For if she had received nourishment from angels in the Lord's temple, while she was still a child, how much more should she be served by the powers on high after she had become herself the Lord's temple!"

        From Fr. Robert Pawell, O.F.M., Director of Programs, Saint Peter's Church in the Loop:          Seven hundred and fifty years ago Clare Offreduccio, whom we know as St. Clare of Assisi, lay on her death bed and whispered: “Go forth in peace, for you have followed the good road. Go forth without fear, for he who created you has made you holy, has always protected you, and loves you as a mother. Blessed be you, my God, for having created me!” She closed her eyes in death holding to her heart “the privilege to be poor” granted to her and her sisters by Holy Father. The pope had finally capitulated to her request that she and the women who would follow her the grace to live the gospel as radically as did her friend Francis and his brothers.          Living at a time when women had little or no say in their destinies, she emerges as a woman who lived her life in a passionate way, and who let nothing get in the way of living out her vision of life as it began to unfold. As a young girl in Assisi she came to know St Francis, having often heard him preach. Recalling the first moments of her religious journey she confessed that she could not keep away, because his “words seemed to her afire with God.” For years she had been living a life centered on the gospels within the sanctuary of her family and she desired to live that life even more radically. And there was Francis living out her heart’s deepest desire. She began to meet with him seeking his counsel and advice. This had to be done in secret, as she was of a noble family, and her family would certainly not approve of her associating with the crazed son of the cloth merchant, Pietro Bernadone. It soon became clear to her that she was being called to embark on a new way of living with the Lord. Leaving aside all security, she secretly left home on the night of Palm Sunday, 1212, to join Francis and his followers. She was just eighteen years old.     urlLink   Continue reading Fr.

        Saint John Vianney was born a Lyons in 1786. After overcoming many difficulties, he was ordained a priest. He was entrusted with a parish in the town of Ars in the diocese of Belley. He cared for this parish in a marvelous way by his preaching, his mortification, prayer, and good works. Since he was renowned for great skill in helping penitents, people came to him from many regions and devoutly accepted his counsels. He died in 1859.           Father of mercy, you made Saint John Vianney outstanding in his priestly zeal and concern for your people. By his example and prayers, enable us to win our brothers and sisters to the love of Christ and come with them to eternal glory. Amen.  (from the  Liturgy of the Hours )          Curé of Ars, pray for us!
