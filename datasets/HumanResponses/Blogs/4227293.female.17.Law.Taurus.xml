      Hey. I talked to my friend yesterday and she doesn't know if her sister is pregnant, and they are going to tell her mom about it. Today we went to the park and fed the ducks. Me, my friend and my lil sister got in the water... It was really cold but it was fun. I almost slipped and fell a few times but it was all good. But we had fun. Uummm lets se... Then we went to my mom's friends house... ( :) )... We hung out there for a lil while and we threw the football around and my cousin threw water at me and it went up my nose... But it was ok He don't know that im so going to get him back for that. It will happen when he least expects it. Well then we went to the Wilder-beasts house lol. God that woman is freakin enormous. Don't even get me started... Then we came home. And thats about it. It was a fun boring day if that makes since... We might see if we can go partying later... I gotta go for now but i will re-update later cuz i have some other things to talk about. Talk to you later...Ashlie*

        Hey. Im debating on whether or not i should confront my friend. I mean i don't want to start anything else with her but i just hate that she's talkin about me. If she really is. I just don't understand. Im feeling better but my chest&nbsp; hurts like a MoFo. Hhm... i feel like theres something im forgetting to tell you. I don't know. Maybe it will come to me soon. Im so weirdly glad that we have started school. When im there i don't have to think about some tings so much. It's a good release. In a weird way. I'm now workin on applying to colleges so i will let you know how that goes. Good i hope. It's a lot of pressure and i have had some amazing help. But i gotta go. Duty calls. I will talk to you later. Love ya tonz...Ashlie*

         Hey. Well i so didn't know what to put for a subject. Anyway, the day has been ok. OMG I had so much fun in 1st period. Lol, i so love that class. *i loath you* ha ha... It's an inside joke, you just had to be there. Anyway i just love that class. In second period we read a poem... It was really boring, i tried so hard to concentrate but i just couldn't it was so boring. Umm... 3rd period was boring 2. I don't really like that class. I have been having breathing problems all day and i haven't really been beeling food, so i got into 4th and i thought i was going to be ok. All of a sudden i got hott and i started having an asthma attack. So i had to go to the clinic so someone could call my mom. Terry's mom was the one volunteering in there. She is so nice, and funny... lol i love that woman. So about 20-30 minutes it seemed like my mom finally came and got me and i came home. I took a treatment and a nap. When i woke up i felt a lil better. So i was going to do my homework and i realized that i had the wrong notebook. So i was stressed out and i decided to go take a drive and get my correct notebook. Well my favorite road by Nathan's house was blocked off so i had to detour and i so didn't know where i was going. So i got my stuff and went home. Then i did my homework. A lil while later i went back to sleep. I woke up about 30 minutes ago.           Uummm... well that wsa boring.. lol let me see what else i have to tell you. i really can't think of anything else... Well i guess im going to go i gotta go take another treatment. Talk to you later...     LoVe Ya ToNz,     ~*aShLiE*~

        Hey. Howz it going? Good i hope. Nikki and Lauren came over a lil while ago and Lauren told me about her problems. Which by far are one of the dumbest things that i have ever heard. How can you tell someone you can't be friends with their kids b/c you have graduated? That's so stupid. But anyway, hopefully things will work out between them.

       Hey. Well it's getting around that time. Time to go back to school. I can't wait. I haven't been since Wednesday... That's why im excited. I have been having really bad asthma problems. Anyway, Im actually getting to the point where I like school. Im really sad that I missed freshman Friday. But I have heard some of the horror stories. Poor lil freshman. lol.    Anyway... I am so (x59584) pissed off right now you just can't even imagine. Ugh. Sometimes I wonder how and why I get myself into some of the stuff I do... And how I get mixed up with such ass holes. But it's ok. Im through.I am now wiping my hands clean of screwed up bitches and im moving on, b/c you know what I don't need them. UGH!!!!! If you knew what I was talkin about you would so understand and agree with me. I think im gonna have to go the my John Mayer CD! That's how pissed off and stressed out I am right now. When im that way I just go away from ppl and listen to John... He makes me feel better. The music is very soothing and it calms be down other wise I would be beatin some asses right now. UGH!!! Let me just stop right there...    Anyway. My friend Tara and I are thinkin about workin on plans for a road trip. If we can get it together for next summer that would be sweet!! I would love it. Alina and I were takin about that once but I don't know... The weird thing is she (Tara) doesn't really know anyone who would want to stay in a car for a long period of time and I don't either. I mean I really don't like it either but if im with friends and we have music and snacks or we talk or whatever it will make the trip pass by so much faster. I don't know where we will go but we have pLeNtY of time to figure it out. Nikki and I wanted to go to Ireland just b/c it would be amazing but then we started thinkin about $$$ and we decided to go somewhere cheaper! We will come up with something.      Ok. Seriously... How can you be mad at someone and not tell them and all of a sudden be like fuck you. lol... Anyway... I was so happy b/c I checked my email earlier today and I got 2 emails and an e-card from Mira. I haven't heard from her all summer. I hate that she had to move... Sux a lot... Well im about to go get my John Mayer cd before I have to hurt someone... Talk to you soon.   You should go look at my other journal and profile:    urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/users/ghskutie05cg/     urlLink http://www.buddyprofile.com/viewprofile.php?username=cgkutie2005&amp;u=cgkutie05blue     Love always,      Ashlie*

        Hey,   &nbsp;   Howz it going? Good i hope. Yesterday was awesome. We had alot of fun. We went to the park and played in the water and played with the ducks and walked up alot of stairs. Then we went to my moms friends house.  &nbsp;We hung out there for a lil bit. " i caught it and i ran into a tree" is the quote for yesterday. God that was hillarious. It was one of those you had to be there things. Man that was funny. Anyway but yeah it was fun.   &nbsp;   I have decided that it's time that i make new friends. i Think i need some more. One of my friends and i wanted to go to ireland next summer, until we realized how much it costs so i think we might go to virginia or something. Were not sure yet. It would bu fen. And my mom won't really let me go on road trips or anything, unless they really know the ppl. But i will be 18 and i can tell them to kiss my ass. So im happy.   &nbsp;   Oh yeah speaking of 18. Im doing great with the college searches and all. Well i gotta go. More later. Love ya tonz...   &nbsp;   Ashlie*

       Hey. Howz it going? Good i hope. Man, It seems like it's been forever since  i have written in my journal. But it feels good. Ok so hhmm.... School is  going wonderful. I love it most of the time seriously... I think it's b/c  this is so my last year of school. God im so excited... But Im really  worried tho b/c i have to pass all of my classes and then some to graduate.  I know i can do it if i work hard but im still scared. Anyway, Well I just  wanted to say hey and tell you about my weekend. So here we go...  Friday--> Of course i went to school and we got out at 3:10. Afterwards i  went straigh home b/c i had some stuff i had to do and i had some errands to  run before the game. Then around 5 or so Alina called me and asked me if i  wanted to go to the game with her. So to make a long story short we went. It  was so funny tho b/c when we got there we were winning so we were just so  sure that we were going to beat Lee. But lol, we so didn't... We hung out  with: David, Maegan, Steven and some other ppl that i don't know their  names. So when the game was over (by the way we lost 27-6 i think) we were  walkin to the car and we ran into Kaitlynna nd Malia. Malia was going home  b/c she didn't feel good and Kaitlynn's parents didn't want her to drive to  the jam so she rode with us. It was fun i have never hung out with her  outside of school before. So we went to the jam and it was awesome. I saw  Kyle, Nathan, Lauren, Maegan, Erica, Brittany, Patrick and a bunch of other  ppl. They almost shut it down b/c seniors were bringing beer and stuff  inside the school. I think a boy may have gotten arrested. Im not sure but  it was a great jam. Then i got home around 12:30 and i went to bed b/c i was  so tired.  Saturday--> I slept for a while. Then i woke up and went out and did a bunch  of stuff with friends. I was out pretty much all day. I went to wal-mart. I  haven't been in there in a while. So it was ok. It was a peaceful and fun  day.  Sunday-->I hung out at home with my family. Jea came over and drove us  crazy. Nikki called me and asked me if i wanted to go to Goodies with her  and we went and we also went to McDonalds. Then i came back home and hung  out. I couldn't go anywhere so some friends came over and we hung out. It  was fun. I talked to alot of friends that i haven't talked to in a while. I  wondered if chad made it home from Vegas safely. I talked to julie. Well we  didn't really talk. I sent her a text message and asked her when she was  leaving for Penn. State, and she said that she was leaving Tuesday. I don't  know tho it seemed like she didn't want to be bothered so i didn't even try  to talk to her anymore. Cuz she was like "Tuesday and im busy today and  tomm. ANd i was like damn i just wanted to know i don't want to hang out  with you or anything. I don't know maybe she didn't mean anything by it but  it seemed to me like she did. So i just told her i was wonderin b/c i wanted  to say bye to her and all before she left. I don't know... Im not even going  to say anything about that. Anyway...  Ok you guys, im sorry that this is so short but i gotta go b/c i still have  to do my homework and get ready for school tomm. So i will talk to you soon.   Oh crap... Before i go. I have to tell you about my new crush. Im not going  to say his name or anything... But he goes to school with me. I have 2  classes with him. He plays football for Grissom. He's really nice, and sweet  and he's hilariously funny. I love that dude. Well i don't love him like  love i want to spend the rest of my life with kind of love but i mean like i  love him he's really kewl. But yeah, I haven't told anybody that i like him  yet, but i have a friend that i think that knows i do or at least that im  interested so shes tryin to get us to show up at the same places so we can  talk and all. But yeah. I just wanted you to know. Ok i seriously gotta go.  Talk to you soon...   LoVe Ya ToNz,  ~*aShLiE*~
