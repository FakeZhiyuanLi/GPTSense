      Life is juz a movie without a happy endin, Life is juz song, a sad sad song, If i'm feelin happy, I know tt life's juz teasin, Cuz sooner or later, everythin goes wrong.  That's wad i think rite now... well it's true ain't it... i mean the moment u think life is perfect... it throws u a curveball... it's like a reality show... juz when u think it's over, u get a twist u would never imagine.. come to think of it, it is a reality show, it's the original reality show. IT'S REALITY!!!! But if everythin was direct and according to plan, wad kind of life is that rite??? yea yea... i know u guys probably think i'm a pesimistic idiot. Well i'm juz sayin wad i feel... it is my site after all... anywae, this is wad true wisdom means... i mean confusious and philosophers are wise and all... but true wisdom comes with hard true facts. confusious was smart enuff to cushion the blow with confusin words... that's all... where do u think he got his name??? :-p   Ok my piss-on-life phase is over... now it's time to be the life-is-good phase... Rite now... im pretty happpy actually.. yea yea... wad a surprise. but it's true... i got my good frens... i got my frens and i got emma watson hehe... juz kiddin... orh yar... the only thing i dun have rite now... is money to spend with my frens.. but they get that and they willin to look beyond tt and sacrifice spendin money themselves... hell... that's y they are my good freinds anywae... wad else is good??? hmm orh yea, music... rite now, i'm really really into music.. i'm listenin it to it hours after hours.. it may not be something new to da rest of u... but it is to me. in fact the 4 line rhyme at the start of this post, actually has a tune to it... and it's original... sigh the things u do when u'r doin amaths till u'r bored as hell...   Ok now it's time for the u-guys-noe-shit-abt-me phase... ok tt sounded cruel but it's true... some of u think i'm a conceited little bastard... some of u think i'm creative... some of u think i'm a meanie... and i'd like to think tt most of u think i'm a funny guy who is witty... tell u the truth i'm all of that... i ain't perfect i noe that. I am conceited, only because i refuse to have self-esteem issues and i over do things a bit... i am a meanie... cuz i say wad i feel... those of u got prob with that... well i got prob with u tt's probably y i said such 'mean' things to u... as for the funny part... thank u...:-p and thank u to the few 3 or 4 of u that understands me... u guys are my closest friends...   yar well i think i wrote a bit much... man.. i whined like a 5 yr old girl ( no offense to girls, 5 yr olds or both)... but hey... wad else do i do at 0030 in the mornin... unlike some of u... yea u noe hu u r... i dun surf for *ahem* explicit stuff.... so till nxt time... adios.. sayonara... bye bye... selamat tinggal... ciao... yea i noe... i'm juz makin this longer for personal pleasure and satisfaction... hehe... damn do i have anythin else to say??? nth i guess... now i'm gonna post this and wonder wad do i do till i feel sleepy...bye

      "Thru the pain and the sorrows,when my heart was empty and hollow, you were my reason to live for tomorrow" ---- Haniff  Yeap been a long time since i last wrote in... But after i came back from m'sia i got pretty busy... so anywae, why is it every movie i watch including those based on a true story always different than my life? See in movies, bad guys will reign at the beginning of the movie whereas good guys reign at the end... But why is it there isn't a single preiod of time that i reign and be happy?? well who cares... (me probably) anywaes... with the mother tounge 'o' levels being over... i have come to the realisation of how close the 'o' levels are... N i am scared shitless... yet, i seem to be able to find the time to write this stupid thing that no one seems to be reading... well it's ok... one of the reasons i write this thing is not for others to read it but for me to read it... so that i know how my life is progressin tho i dun think that progressing is the right word for it... I hope my future will improve and who knows maybe i'll lead a movie life one day... Like i said in the previous post, i am a whiner... but i dun care... it seems that the only thing worth writing in these posts are complains and feelings of sorrow... Guess tt's the only thing in life tt i'll remember.   You noe wad, maybe it's time i change my attitude on life... it's abt time i take a stand... gona make my presence felt and my work appreciated... ain't gonna be hesitant abt asking or approaching someone new... at least tt's wad my horoscope tells me to do... i dun believe em but wad the hey... it makes sense.... so till next time sayonara and au revoiure... dunno if i spelled that properly... and i'll update on wether my life has really changed or if this was juz another one of those i'm gonna change my life speeches without actually doin it...

      'One can only feel joy if he is first in depression.'-----Haniff-----  I am so damn bloody happy.I got an A1 for my 'o'level mother tounge. Phew.... I know why i'm so short. all the weight of exams and other stuff was on my shoulders.... now one huge load has been lifted.... i'm so glad... Then i see other people's reactions. Pains the hell out of me. I seriously din expect some others like Sharifah Mitzi or Yuniza to get anythin less then A2.... haiz feels so damn unfair.... It's almost like i cheated them or smth i dunno.... juz feels so sad.... A friend asked me today, who do i like? wad do i say? i wanna tell him i like her.... but the name juz wouldn't come out of my mouth.... maybe i oughta tell him.... he is gd friends with her.... (to the guy, is this a big enuff hint??) juz hope once he know he'll keep quiet abt it.... When he guessed the person i never denied... i couldn't... I'm one of the biggest liar around and i couldn't lie abt that.... too bad, she the only one hu beleives me, at least i think so....  I'm outta her league and i have no i dea how to get in... i make her laugh once in a while at least tt helps... She always talk abt other guys around me so that's a bit troubling.... Funny thing is, i support her if the guy she likes is nice or good.... guess i like her so much i care abt her happiness more than my own....  I'm gonna end my entry here today.... to moany to moan more...lol.... anyway peace out to the world.... good luck with the exams and wish me luck..... in my exams and my life...i'll need it...

      "The real me is the one i am when i'm thinking about you"--------ME--  Damn! at first this whole blog thing was supposed to juz fill up my time for the holidays... but it's a gd way to waaste time too...hehe.... ok as usual i'm gonna whine again... wad can i say... my life sucks... most of u noe wad happen to my wallet... so tt sucks.... and have u ever felt like u'r never good enuff for someone cuz they always tok abt other guys like gods??? if u haven.... u'r one of those stinkin guys... lucky u... but u juz screwed my life.... ok next point.... exams comin and i keep thinkin of her... i noe i wun get her i can't get her.... but oh how much i want to have her... If only she knew... nah that would be a bad ting... i'l be rejected she'll feel guilty and the last thing i want is for her to feel bad... so I'm juz gonna keep my mouth shut and enjoy the moments i have with her as friends.... you know... that moment when u feel so damn joyous and happy cuz u'r with her but you also feel painful as hell cuz u know tt's the only type of moment u can have??? a moment of two friends bein together nothing more....always less..... It's like a blissful blister in your heart.... you know i see other people's blogs and they have so much excitement and colour and life and people veiwing it... i look at mine and i see sorrow, depression lonelyness and something pathetic.... but u know wad... that's my life.... so till next time see ya and be happy... cuz u have a happy life... heck juz be happy u have a life... i dun even have one... cept for her and the few friends i have.... friends that seem to be drifting aprt and gettin fewer and fewer.... so everyone else.... read my blog and be happy.... be happy u u dun have to write the stuff i write.... be happy u dun have my life... best of all be happy cuz u'r heart still allows u to... BE HAPPY  P/S: If u wanna know wad my title 'deep thoughts in shallow waters' mean, it means all these feelings ideas and thoughts i have those that i wrote above... is cramped up in me and i'm overflowing with sorrow...  and that ppl is another one of these deep thoughts that is gona cramp up these 'shallow waters' called HANIFF....
