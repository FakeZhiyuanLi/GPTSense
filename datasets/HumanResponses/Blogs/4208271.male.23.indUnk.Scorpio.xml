      A quote made by Ronald Reagan from his "A Time for Choosing" speech made in 1964:  He said liberals refuse to acknowledge that the choice is not between "peace and war, only between fight and surrender." He added that liberals tell us "if we only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy, he will forget his evil ways and learn to love us," (a la Jimmy Carter).  All who disagree with the peace crowd are "indicted as warmongers.  Let's set the record straight.  There is no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there is only one guaranteed way you can have peace - and you can have it in the next second -  surrender ."  This was made in reference to Soviet Russia, but I think it applies to our current state of affairs very well.

      From drudgereport.com:  "The Kerry campaign calls on a publisher to 'withdraw book' written by group of veterans,  claiming  veterans are lying about Kerry's service in Vietnam and operating as a front organization for Bush. Kerry campaign has told Salon.com that the publisher of Unfit for Command is 'retailing a hoax'... 'No publisher should want to be selling books with proven falsehoods in them,' (what proven falsehoods?)"  This coming from the party of tolerance and diversity.  And from the party whose previous front running nominee, Howard Dean, claimed President Bush would  burn books , comparing him to a  Nazi/Hitler .

      So this week Sen. John Kerry has begun to blast President Bush for his realignment of troops thoughout the world - a withdrawl of 70,000 troops from South Korea and Germany scheduled to occur over the next ten years.  He said that cutting our forces in Korea "is clearly the wrong signal to send" at this time.  Also, Kerry has made comments that the President is doing this as a political move to make up for the 100,000+ troops currently stationed in Iraq, yada, yada, yada...  I guess we've gotten to the point in the Presidential campaign where any action made by President Bush will be painted as a political move.  The only problem is that Bush has been talking of such a reduction in troop strength since he took office in 2001, as their placement in these areas is outdated - a cold war relic.  AND: Let's review Senator Kerry's comments made 19 days ago on ABC's  This Week :  "I will have a significant, enormous reduction in the level of troops. I think we can significantly change the deployment of troops [in Iraq], not just there but elsewhere in the world.   In the Korean peninsula   perhaps,   in Europe   perhaps. There are great possibilities open to us. But this administration has very little imagination."  (Sing along to the theme song of  Flipper ) "They call him Flipper, Flipper, faster than lightning, no-one you see, can flip faster then he"

      So, I'm reading on the net tonight to read that the NY Times is running a page one lead: "the story of how swift boat veterans with a grievance were found by Republicans looking to tarnish Kerry's image" - drudgereport.com  I find this absolutely absurd. Again, the Times is displaying its blatent partisanship with its plans to run this story, only choosing to tell half truths.  "Some of the veterans have recanted their stories and made charges that military records prove untrue," the Times explains in its 3,500-world splash, which has been previewed by Drudge.  I'm sure more will follow tomorrow...  Will I ever find time to write my entry about Michael Moore???

      Finally, after weeks of "controversy" surrounding the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth advertisement, John Kerry has refuted the claims made in the add, instead of trying to discredit those men who served in Vietnam.  Apparently there has been a release of a military document that desputes the claims made by Larry Thurlow, a fellow swift boat commander who served alongside John Kerry.  I'll attempt to provide a brief synopsis of recent events:  Thurlow has disputed the claims made by Kerry over the events that occured on March 13, 1969.  Kerry says that their "flotilla" of swift boats came under fire, which lead to his rescue of Lt. James Rassman, while on patrol of Viet-Cong controlled territory.  For this action, rescuing an American soldier under enemy fire, Kerry received a Bronze Star.  However, last month Thurlow swore in an affidavit that Kerry was "not under fire" when Rassman was pulled out of the water.  He went as far as to say that the citation granting Kerry a Bronze Star, which states Kerry was under "small arms and automatic weapons fire", was "totally fabricated".  "I never heard a shot" is was Thurlow said in his affidavit.  The kink in Thurlow's claims is that he also received a Bronze Star, and his citation for that medal says Thurlow's actions "took place under constant enemy small arms fire which Lt. Thurlow completely ignored in providing immediate assistance."  Yesterday Kerry commented on the release of this new military document in the following manner: "Of course, this group isn't interested in the truth and they're not telling the truth..."  I say we should dig a little deeper.  Thurlow said he had lost the citation behind his receipt of the award more then 20 years ago, and that he was unwilling to authorize the release of his military records becuase he feared attempts by the Kerry campaign to discredit him and other anti-Kerry veterans (as if he didn't do enough after his four month stay in Vietnam with Jane Fonda).   Here's Thurlow's reply to the release of the document: "It's like a Hollywood presentation here, which wasn't the case.  My personal feeling was always that I got the award for coming to the rescue of the boat that was mined (not under enemy fire).  This cast doubts on anybody's awards.   It is sickening and disgusting ."   He later said that he would consider his award to be "fraudulent" if coming under enemy fire was the basis for it .  Adding, "I am here to state that we weren't under fire," in a direct claim that the citations are false.  He also said that he thought Kerry could have been the source of some of the language used in the citation.  Also: "Thurlow and other anti-Kerry veterans have repeatedly alleged that Kerry was the author of an after-action report that described how his boat came under enemy fire.  As the senior skipper in the flotilla, Thurlow might have been expected to write the after-action report for March 13, but he said that  Kerry routinely "duked the system"  to present his version of events." (msnbc.com)  AND: "Two other Swift boat skippers who were direct participants in the March 13, 1969, mine explosion on the Bay Hap, Jack Chenoweth and Richard Pees, have said  they do not remember coming under "enemy fire."  A fourth commander, Don Droz, who was one of Kerry's closest friends in Vietnam, was killed in action a month later." (msnbc.com)  ONE MORE: "The Bronze Star recommendations for both Kerry and Thurlow were signed by Lt. Cmdr. George M. Elliott, who received reports on the incident from his base in the Gulf of Thailand.  Elliott is a supporter of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and has questioned Kerry's actions in Vietnam ." (msnbc.com)  Here's my point.  Ever since the Democratic Convention John Kerry has made his  4 months  of service over a generation ago the center piece of his bid for the presidency.  In one speech given to an audience of firefighters yesterday, Kerry recalled on this  4 month  period a minimum of three times:  1. "Thirty years ago, official Navy reports documented my service in Vietnam and awarded me the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts."  2. "Thirty years ago, this was the plain truth. It still is. And I still carry the shrapnel in my leg from a wound in Vietnam."  3. "More than 30 years ago I learned an important lesson. When you're under attack the best thing to do is turn your boat into the attack. That's what I intend to do today."  He is basing his whole career, and future, on the  4 months  he spent in Vietnam.  He is trying to use  4 months  to justify being elected the  leader of the free world .  All he can do when he trumpets his reason for election, and then there is open criticism to it, is whine and complain, "accusing President Bush on Thursday of relying on front groups to challenge his record of valor in Vietnam, asserting, 'He wants them to do his dirty work.'" (AP).  What are we supposed to do, not question his  4 months  in service?  Not objectively analyze it in order to determine if he would be an effective leader/defender of our nation?  This is ridiculous.   This has been  one  book ( Unfit for Command ) and  one  add, and it has the democratic party, and its nominee, frightened and scared.  How about the multiple books that have been released over the past 6 months, from Richard Clarke, to Bob Woodward and one HUGE movie grossing over $115 million - to date - bashing President Bush over and over.  Have we heard Bush, or his campaign cry and moan?  Or how about when Bush received an honorable discharge from the Air National Guard, and he had to endure claims that he was AWOL.  CBS, NBC and ABC ran a combine 75 stories on that topic.  You want to know how many stories they've ran on the charges against Kerry's service?   Nine.     Or how about the money aspect?  Kerry has said this about the Swift Boat Veterans: "But here's what you really need to know about them. They're funded by hundreds of thousands of dollars from a Republican contributor out of Texas. They're a front for the Bush campaign. And the fact that the President won't denounce what they're up to tells you everything you need to know. He wants them to do his dirty work."  This entire uproar from the left is over a $150,000 add campaign from an independent group.   How about denouncing the $15-$20 million dollars in donations 527 groups, such as moveon.org, have received from people like George Soros, and the Bush bashing adds that have resulted over the previous 6-12 months, Sen. Kerry?    There is a funny turn of events happening here.  In this case, the "poor" little people that are having their 1st amendment rights enfringed upon are the republicans, and the "rich" tyrants are the democrats.  Oh, and any reference to there being a prominant repubican (John McCain) denouncing the swifties add, and demanding the White House do the same as a reason to discredit this add is ludacris.  What do you think groups such as Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, and MoveOn.org, are  aresult of?  The  McCain -Feingold Campaign Finance reform act.  Of course he wants anything and everything under God's blue sky to denounce this add because it is a glaring loophole in his act, that he spent years trying to get passed through Congress.  One last comment: "The Bush campaign has never and will never question John Kerry's service in Vietnam. The president has referred to John Kerry's service as noble service," the Bush spokesman said.

      For Humor:  Al Gore was stopped for speeding in Astoria, OR on August 3rd, and received a $141 ticket for going 75 mph in a 55 mph zone.  Lt. Dale Rutledge, who did not recognize Vice President Gore until he saw the ex-veep's drivers license, said Gore was polite throughout the encounter.  I wonder what kind of conspiracy theory the left will come up with about this one...

      ...or lack thereof.  In their constant effort to appeal to the voters' emotions, instead of logic, the Democratic party continues to resort to the lowest common denominator - name calling.  These comments continue to absolutely infuriate me, as I wonder why these people are constantly given passes by the media:  *When describing George W. Bush, George Soros, a huge democratic party supporter and the main financier of the 527 group moveon.org, has called President Bush a modern day " Hitler ".  *Likening the Republican party to the Nazi regime of World War II, former vice president and democratic presidential nominee, Al Gore has referred to republicans as " brown shirts ".  *Again, another quote from Gore, he calls President Bush a  liar : "He betrayed this country, he played on your fears!".  *John Kerry, at a rally in Iowa, called Bush supporters " Goons ".  *Terry McAuliffe claimed  Bush was AWOL  during his service to the Air National Guard "without any proof, evidence or substantiation." - Sean Hannity (8/19/04)  *Michael Moore has referred to Bush as a  deserter  for serving in the Air National Guard (not in Vietnam)  *Teresa (TAH-REY-ZA not TAH-REE-SA) Heinz Kerry later said those same Bush supporters in Iowa wanted "Four more years of  hell ".  *Sen. Ted (insert a "hiccup" sound here) Kennedy has said that the war in Iraq was a plan drawn up in Crawford, TX.  *Gov. Howard Dean has said he thinks the theory that President Bush  knew about 9/11  before it happened (This is  absolutely  absurd) is "interesting".  *The Topper: Sen. Tom Harkin called Vice President Dick Cheney a  coward  for not serving in Vietnam. Harkin also made the following comment: "They're running scared because John Kerry has a war record and they don't," said Harkin. "What he (Cheney) is doing and what he is saying is cowardly. The actions are cowardly."  This was in reply to a comment Dick Cheney had made - in a mocking fashion - in reference to Sen. Kerry's comment that he would fight a more "sensitive" war on terror.  Let's take a look at Sen. Harkin's record:  "Senator Harkin is a proven fabricator when it comes to his own Vietnam-era record," (I'm sensing a pattern) reports the Wall Street Journal in Thursday (8/19/04) editions.  "In 1979, Mr. Harkin, then a congressman, participated in a round-table discussion arranged by the Congressional Vietnam Veterans' Caucus. 'I spent five years as a Navy pilot, starting in November of 1962,' Mr. Harkin said at that meeting, in words that were later quoted in a book, Changing of the Guard, by Washington Post political writer David broader. 'One year was in Vietnam. I was flying F-4s and F-8s on combat air patrols and photo-reconnaissance support missions. I did no bombing.'"  "That clearly is not an accurate picture of his Navy service. . . . Mr. Harkin's Navy record shows his only decoration is the National Defense Service Medal, awarded to everyone on active service during those years. He did not receive either the Vietnam Service medal or the Vietnam Campaign medal, the decorations given to everyone who served in the Southeast Asia theater."  "It turned out Mr. Harkin had not seen combat and was stationed in Japan."  From newsmax.com, referencing a period when the communist party was trying to expand beyond Cuba in the Western Hemisphere, and Reagan's back door attempts to thwart the expansion. Kerry, Harkin and other prominent congressional democrats signed the infamous "Dear Commandant" letter, showing their support of the murderous, totalitarian regimes (what a history of defending this country):  In fact, rather than doing his part to beat back global Communism, Harkin was actually an aider and abettor to Moscow's cause.  Unnoted in today's Journal report; in 1986 Harkin famously traveled to Managua, Nicaragua to assure Fidel Castro's proxy Daniel Ortega that Senate Democrats were working overtime to thwart President Reagan's efforts to bring Democracy to the region.  With him on the mission - fellow peacenik Sen. John Kerry.

      As of yesterday (8/17/04) there were three positive:  1. Labor Dept.'s consumer price index (broadest measure of prices paid by consumers) reported a 0.1% decline in prices for the month of July, down from a 0.3% increase in June and off of a predicted 0.2% increase from economists at Breifing.com - mainly fueled by cheaper then expected energy costs  2. Industrial production rose 0.4% in the month of July, the Fed reported, raising capacity utilization to 77.1%.  Factory production rose 0.6 percent in July after June's 0.2 percent drop, and factories operated at 76.3 percent of full capacity, their fastest pace since 76.6 percent in April 2001.  3. The Conference Board's reading on consumer confidence posted a stronger then expected gain in July, reporting an index rating of 106.1, up from a 102.8 reading in June.  This is the fourth straight month of gains, and it is at its highest level since June of 2002.  This has been fueled by the expectation of more employment opportunities in the U.S. market, and is important as consumer spending accounts for more then two thirds of our GDP.

      Here's a couple of snipits of an editorial written by Bobby Eberle (8/12/04), I think applies well to my earlier post:  "Speaking at the Unity Conference, a quadrennial gathering of the four largest minority journalism associations, Sen. Kerry told the audience, 'First of all, had I been reading to children, and had my top aide whispered in my ear, 'America is under attack,' I would have told those kids very politely and nicely that the president of the United States had business that he needed to attend to, and I would have attended to it.'"  "Although plenty has been said regarding President Bush and his efforts in the war on terror, until Kerry's comment no political figure, neither Republican nor Democrat, has criticized President Bush's actions on that terrible day. Now, with either the benefit of divine hindsight or a complete lack of understanding of the fog of the day, Kerry claims he could have done things better. He would have 'attended to business.'"  "  In Kerry's zeal for the White House, he has shown in one sentence that playing politics with the memory of 9/11 is not beyond his limits of decency.   It is impossible to say what we  would have or could have done  during 9/11. It is only possible to say what each one of us  did  do as the events unfolded on that fateful day."  "No one – except Kerry, it seems – can honestly say how they would have acted had they been in a different role on September 11, 2001."  "These are unknown questions and will always remain unknown. Tragedies such as 9/11 make heroes out of normal people and turn novice officeholders into leaders.   Kerry, to his shame, claims a course of action that can never be known.  "  "This campaign for president of the United States will surely have its share of attack ads, accusations and counter-accusations. As it unfolds, I can only hope that Sen. Kerry will remember 9/11 for what it was – a terrible day for America, a day that ended the lives of some and changed the lives of all."

      John Kerry served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for 8 years, and during that time he missed 38 of 49 public hearings of the Intelligence Committee - a 78% absentee rate.  As a democratic senator from Arizona, Dennis DeConcini made the following comment: "Mr. President, the Kerry amendment includes a $1 billion cut in fiscal year 1994 and $5 billion over the next 5 years from intelligence activities." - Feb. 10, 1994  "John Kerry served on the Intelligence Committee from 1993 to 2000, and according to official records, John Kerry missed 76 percent of the public Senate Intelligence Committee hearings during that time. This figure doesn’t include his attendance at closed door meetings. Those records can only be released to the public at John Kerry’s request. This is something that needs to be done, and I join Senator Roberts, Senator Chambliss, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Coleman and others in calling on him to do so, so that the American people can judge the whole picture for themselves." House Majority Leader Dennis Hastert (R-IL) 8/16/04  On  Meet the Press , on 8/15/04, Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) said, "The easiest way out of this is for John Kerry and John Edwards to request of Senator Rockefeller and myself to release the attendance hearings; not only the public hearings, which they have rebutted, but the closed hearings."

      As a senator, John Kerry served on the Senate Intelligence Committee:  1. After the first World Trade Center attack in 1993 Senator Kerry did not attend a committee hearing for a period of one year (Senator Kerry's camp refutes this, claiming he attended closed door meetings. This can be proven as fact if the attendance records are released, as suggested by committee chair Sen. Roberts of Kansas. This, however, requires the authorization of Sen. Kerry, as I understand it.)  2. Sen. Kerry proposed to cut $6 billion from the intelligence budget in 1996 - after a cut of 18% had been enacted  3. In 1997 Sen. Kerry was absent on an Intelligence Committee hearing on the nomination of George Tenant for director of CIA  4. Sen. Kerry proposed $1.5 billion cut in intelligence budget in 1995  5. Sen. Kerry attended 1 day out of a 6 day hearing on restructuring of intelligence community in 1995  ****  The exact year escapes me, but sometime in or around 1989 Sen. Kerry voted against the use of the death penalty against terrorists who have committed acts of terrorism against the United States.

      For some odd reason I was crusing the net tonight and decided I would check out the left's poster child's website,  urlLink www.michaelmoore.com . This is what I saw, listed under "Bush Blew it the Morning of 9/11":   This is an issue about the ultimate presidential duty, acting in an emergency. If nothing else in Washington is nonpartisan, this should be.    But it is not. Republicans are tying themselves in knots trying to defend Bush's actions that morning. The excuses they put forward are absurd:    *He was "gathering his thoughts." This was a moment a President should have imagined a thousand times. There is no time in the nuclear age for a President to sit like Forrest Gump "gathering thoughts" after an attack has begun. Gathering information is what he should have been doing.     *From the White House press secretary: "The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening." I agree that gaining a better understanding of what was happening should have been his goal. What I don't get is how that goal was reached by just sitting there instead of getting up and talking to people. Is he a psychic? Was he receiving the information telepathically?    *"He didn't want to scare the children." Vice President Cheney has said of Kerry, "The senator from Massachusetts has given us ample reason to doubt the judgment he brings to vital issues of national security." So Kerry's judgment is suspect, but at a moment of national crisis, Bush's judgment was: Better not to scare 20 children momentarily than to react immediately to an attack on the country!    If he had just said, "Hey, kids, gotta go do some President business - be good to your moms and dads, bye!" my guess is the kids would have survived.     About a week ago Kerry was quoted as saying (I'm paraphrasing here) that the American public could count on him to do more then sit around for 7 minutes if he were told the country was under attack.    This is a perfect example of what a debacle the mainstream democratic party has come to. How dare they have the balls, the insensitiveness, to politicize the terrorist attack that occurred on 9/11. 3,000 innocent Americans who were doing nothing more then going to work, visiting friends, talking on the phone, making deliveries, etc. had their lives extinguished that morning. Then the modern democratic party has the audacity, arrogance, the disrespect to those who lost their lives and their loved ones mourning their loss to Monday morning quarterback that attack against the United States.  Whatever happened to politics stops at the water's edge? It used to be, that when American men and women were serving their country, defending our freedoms, that topic was off limits in the world of politics. Now, in a blatant display of partisan politics the democratic leadership has decided to politcize the actions of our serving men and women in a feeble attempt to regain the power of the White House. This is a party that has morphed into one that would compromise our country's security in order to further their own agenda - it's disgusting, dishonorable and they should be ashamed of their actions.  I also ask why the face of the modern democratic party (Michael Moore) is unable to objectively criticize President Bush. Instead of plainly stating that he was disappointed in his actions that morning, desiring a more expedient response, he resorts to the level of a fifth grade student, participating in name calling, referring to the President as "Forrest Gump". Moore later takes part in mockery, asking if the President is "psychic". I think what frightens me most is the existence of educated people accepting this as legitimate argument.  Just a quick point, when Kerry openly criticizes the President for actions taken the morning of 9/11, he opens the door for us to ask him what he did that morning. To paraphrase Senator Kerry, he had just exited a meeting with some prominent Senate democrats when they caught word of the events taking place in New York. He, and others in his office then watched the second plane strike the World Trade Center. They sat at a table staring in disbelief, and to directly quote Senator Kerry, "Nobody could think". The next thing he heard was an explosion and smoke rising from the area of the Pentagon....  Plane Two struck the World Trade Center at 9:03 am The plane that hit the Pentagon struck at 9:43 am  How do you explain your 40 minutes of inactivity Senator Kerry?

      So maybe this is why John Kerry wanted a nuclear freeze while Reagan was defeating the Soviet Union, he wanted to keep his buddies in power:  ****  Taken from  urlLink www.kerrylied.com :  "On Memorial Day, May 31, 2004,  urlLink Vietnam Vets for the Truth  broke an  urlLink extraordinary story  about a photograph hanging in the Vietnamese Communist War Remnants Museum (formerly known as the "War Crimes Museum") in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). The photograph, displayed in a room dedicated to foreign activists who contributed to the Communist victory over America in the Vietnam War, shows Senator John Kerry being greeted by Comrade Do Muoi, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (July 15-18, 1993)."  "The existence of photographs showing Senator Kerry meeting with General Secretary Do Muoi is not in question. In the course of pursuing the POW and MIA issue, it is reasonable that Senator Kerry would seek to meet with the communist leaders of Vietnam. The critical issue is that the Vietnamese communists have chosen to honor Senator Kerry in their War Crimes Museum for his assistance in helping them achieve victory over the United States. The sign outside the entrance to the room where Kerry's photo is displayed reads: "The World Supports Vietnam in its Resistance." Also exhibited inside the room are protest banners and emblems from various nations and photographs of international leaders who supported North Vietnam's cause."  ****  Also honored in the museum is a photograph of Jane Fonda, who stands next to Nguyen Thi Dinh, deputy commander of the Viet Cong.  In the early '70s Senator John McCain was interviewed by Newsweek, in which he sad that his captors at the "Hanoi Hilton" would repeatedly use speeches given by John Kerry, Jane Fonda and the like, as a psychological tool against American POWs.  Here's a clip from an editorial written by Geoff Metcalf that I found to sum up the reason why these vets are coming out against Senator Kerry, and have for almost 30 years:  "The critical distinction between the two presidential candidates is not legislative, or political. The critical distinction is leadership.  Men who served with John Kerry overwhelmingly find him epically deficient as a leader.  Woodrow Wilson once observed, “Leadership does not always wear the harness of compromise. Once and again one of those great influences, which we call a Cause, arises in the midst of a nation. Men of strenuous minds and high ideals come forward.... The attacks they sustain are more cruel than the collision of arms.... Friends desert and despise them.... They stand alone and oftentimes are made bitter by their isolation.... They are doing nothing less than defy public opinion, and shall they convert it by blows. Yes.”  John Kerry is a Kumbaya/John Lennon “all you need is love” (and the United Nations) Neville Chamberlain.  Remember the movie ‘Gladiator’? Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) said, “Strength and honor.” Kinda the same thing Admiral Hoffman, Admiral Denton, Captain Elliott, John O’Neil and Jerry Corsi are saying…as well as George W. Bush.  Kerry is ‘Unfit for Command’ and although the bleeding heart base of the Democratic party has convinced themselves “Anyone but Bush” is an adequate response to the question of November 2nd, it is counter-intuitive and a for real threat to a national security…and our lives.  Kerry is anathema to our national security. He lacks “Strength and honor”…duplicity and home movies notwithstanding."

It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were  free ." - Ronald Reagan

      Have you noticed that the Kerry camp has yet to discredit what the vets are saying about him. All they have yet to do is attack their personal creditability, try to link them to the republican party - even though there is none, and John O'Neill, co-author of  Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John  Kerry, a registered democrat - and threaten to sue any television station that airs the adds.  There are also holes in Kerry's speech he gave on the senate floor in 1986 when he claimed: "I remember Christmas of 1968 sitting on a gunboat in Cambodia. I remember what it was like to be shot at by the Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge and Cambodians, and have the president of the United States telling the American people that I was not there; the troops were not in Cambodia. I have that memory which is seared--seared--in me."  Khmer Rouge troops did not enter the Vietnamese theater until the Eastern Offensive in 1972.  Here's what O'Neill said in his book:  “John Kerry describes Christmas Eve in Cambodia as a critical turning point in his life. We now know that his story is completely false.  My question is how many people do you know have invented a turning point, one that is seared in his memory?  While it makes sense for John Kerry to come clean about the Cambodia story, it is one of several tales that the Kerry campaign will have to face and clarify.”  “By claiming we were engaged in a war crime and crossing international borders,  John Kerry damaged the credibility of all the commanding officers above him and insulted the sailors who served with him .”  I also had the chance to listen to the doctor who speaks in the ad be interviewed on the radio earlier in the week, and he recalled Kerry boasting how he was going to be the next JFK from Massachusetts. This while being treated for his third purple heart "wound", which was described as a piece of metal in his forearm the size of a match stick. The result of Kerry discharging a grenade too close to his position - catching flack.

      In case you haven't noticed, earlier this week when John Kerry was campaigning in Nevada, he proclaimed that  knowing what he knows now  he would still have voted for the resolution granting President Bush power to use military force against Iraq. "Yes I would vote for the authority. I think it's the right authority for the President to have." - John Kerry, 8/10/04.  "Across the weekend, the Kerry campaign debated how Mr. Kerry should respond. 'There were a lot of ideas,' said one official, 'from silence, to throwing the question back in the president's face.'" - NY Times, 8/12/04  Why should there be the need to debate how he should respond? Shouldn't he be able to respond with how *he* truly feels towards the issue, or how the democratic machine wants him to respond in order to look more attractive to his party - and more importantly the "swing" voters. For almost a year Kerry's stance on the war has been one of defiance, before that he was a proponent, and now he's back to supporting it?  Throughout the democratic primaries he was campaigning himself to be anti-war, which was the only way he would be able to win over his parties nomination, and their venomous hatred for President Bush's defense of our way of life. If you can remember, at the time he was doing battle with Gov. Dean, who claimed to be against the war since the beginning - a proclamation Senator Kerry cannot make. Now, after making himself to be anti-war to win the party's nomination he must attempt to lean to the middle in order to win some swing votes in the all important states of Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida. What he is doing here, in broad daylight, is contradicting himself on a grand scale. As late as July 11th he was claiming to be against the war on Larry King Live. In his acceptance speech at the Democratic "Reinvention" Convention he made the following comments:  "America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to."  "Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent in the eye and truthfully say: 'I tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice. We had to protect the American people (and) fundamental American values from a threat that was real and imminent.' So lesson one, this is the only justification for going to war."  More over, Kerry has repeatedly accused the President of misleading the nation, distorting intelligence and over exaggerating the threat of WMD - and followed that up with: "They were wrong, and soldiers lost their lives because they were wrong."  How does that make anti-war voters, who have planned to vote for John Kerry feel? When they thought they nominated an anti-war candidate as he tells us that he would still vote for the resolution granting the President the right to use military action against Iraq  even knowing what we do now about Iraq's apparent absence of weapons of mass destruction .  So other then WMDs, what threat was "real and imminent" to validate your reasoning behind voting for this resolution, and sending our sons and daughters into harms way, Senator Kerry? I'll wait until you confer with your think tank before you answer...  They call him Flipper:  This is an example proving that John Kerry is a man that will do anything, say anything, to succeed in life. He will compromise his values and change his stances on the most important of issues - our nation's security - as much as the weather changes. He is a man with no deep rooted convictions of right and wrong, of the existence of good and evil in the world. The only thing John Kerry concerns himself with is what will further his political career.  ****  "Now, almost two years after he voted for the war in Iraq, and almost 220 days after switching positions to declare himself the anti-war candidate, my opponent has found a new nuance," Bush said. "After months of questioning my motives and even my credibility, Sen. Kerry now agrees with me."

      So, I'm sitting at work this morning, going through my normal "just getting to work" routine that almost everyone has. Mine includes booting up the terminal, putting my lunch in the fridge, getting a cup of coffee, looking over the work account managers left on my desk from the night before and hoping that this day's crappiness rating will be less then average - on a side note it is kind of depressing being 23 and already stuck in a daily grind that progressively gets worse and worse with each passing week.  Anyways...I need to stay on track. A couple of days ago I was going through this routine when a coworker of mine - we'll call him John - begins to spout off about something political that had occurred the day before. This happened somewhere inbetween looking over the work left for me and hoping for a better then average day on the craptacular scale. When I heard the line, "Hey Jarod, did you hear about the swift boat commercial?" I knew it was down hill from there and the highlight of my day had past - my cup of coffee, and a text message from Marie. This guy and his political stances on issues are a point of frustration for me. He will defend to the death that he is an "independent" voter, but every stance he takes, every joke he makes, is from the liberal viewpoint. I cannot comprehend why he refuses to admit what he is, why he's so afraid - more on that later. He continues with his story that this commercial is a blackeye on the Whitehouse and that there some republicans that are upset with the ad, etc. So I ask why it's a blackeye, and he promptly steps on his soap box - I think he's on his 5th or 6th because he uses them so much that he has worn them out - and proceeds to explain how you do not attempt to dishonor what a person did when he was serving his country, because he was defending his country and our rights, blah blah blah. I made the counterpoint that Kerry invited this critique of his service in Vietnam when he made it the centerpiece of his election bid, citing it as an example of his leadership abilities and why he would make a great leader as President. He replied that there were several fellow servicemen who support his bid, and I informed him that there are several  hundred  that condemn him - all supported with signed and dated depositions. Also that it was a completely independent add - in creation and funding, claiming no allegiance to the republican party. So, again, why is a critique of the reason why a candidate proclaims himself to be a capable leader a blackeye on the Whitehouse? I wish I could describe the lost look in his eyes, like a deer caught in headlights. Unfortunately it lasted only a second and he reverted to his holier then thou attitude, condemning the add, claiming it is just as wrong as when the democrats where trying to smear President Bush's well documented service record in the Air National Guard. Funny, as how I can remember wise crack on top of wise crack about how President Bush was born with a silver spon in his mouth and how dad got him out of serving, etc. Weird how stories change when the tables are turned?  Mission Statement:  Later in the day I realized that I hear this smear rhetoric everyday, and everyday it is allowed to pass without a response. This not only comes from John, but from other coworkers, friends and people I meet in everyday life. Unfortunately I feel that a majority of the population only sees one side of the issues of the day. This blog - whatever the hell that is - will be my place to attempt to deliver a different point of view to those who only hear that one side. And whatever the heck I feel like writing in addition to that.  Updates will come as soon as I can write them...check back often.
