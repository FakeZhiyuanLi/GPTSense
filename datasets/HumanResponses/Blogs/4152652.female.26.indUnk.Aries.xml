      I still do not know what I want to be.  First I wanted to study fine art and be a painter.  Then I decided to join the navy one day and off I went and became a damage controlman/firefighter.  I wanted to continue on as a firefighter outside the navy but changed my mind after becoming a mother.  I'm a wife and a mom, I've stayed home for the last four years after the birth of my daughter and my son.  My restless spirit is starting to kick in once again, I feel like I'm no closer to figuring what I want to do with my life than when I was eighteen.  I do not want just a job, I want to do something I feel passionate about.  I did feel that way about the firefighting for a time but I've lost it, I know in my heart that it is not for me any more.  I just hate this restless and incomplete feeling, when does it go away?  I'm 26 years old, why do I still not know what I want, what I should do?  I feel like I've stayed home as long as I can but where do I go from here.  I guess I'm talking about more than a job, I mean I've gotten most of what I thought I always wanted.  I always wanted to be married and have kids and own my own home and I thought life with be complete with those things but now that I have them it does not feel complete.  I feel like I've lost myself, and do not know what I am now.  I do not know if this makes sense, I love my husband and childeren I just feel something is missing.  I can not really think of how else to explain it.  Maybe someone who has made it through thier twenties can give me some insight.

      My doctor thinks I may have cronic fatiuge syndrome and I'm having a relaspe right now.   I do not know if that is the right thing to call it but I felt pretty normal for a month now until a few days ago.  The worst part is the foggy funny feeling in my head, I can't think strait and typing this is taking way way longer than normal.  Stress makes it  worse for me, but there is no way to escape that.  It would'nt be so bad if I had family around,  I feel bad for my kids like they are getting cheated by having a mom who cannot do as much.  My husband is in the military and has been gone for 14 months now so I'm totally alone and It is starting to get to me.   I only have two more months of being on my own with this, so I have that to look forward to.   Well I can not think of anything else to say and I'm rambling.  I just wanted to post something since I have not posted anything in a few days.

      My baby girls birthday is tommorrow, she'll be four years old. I was two weeks overdue and my doctor finally induced my labor. Kaylynn was born after nineteen and a half hours on august 13th at 2.59am. She wieghed ten pounds four oz and was twenty two inches long. She was so beautiful and wide eyed and I remember being so amazed that she was mine. It was love at first sight. She is named after my mother who died when I was six, I had always planned to name my daughter that if I had one. I did not know if I was having a boy or a girl when she was born and I was so excited when the doctor announced we had a girl. She is still beautiful and a very happy loving little girl. Time goes by so fast I cannot belive she is four. Happy Birthday.

      SEATTLE (Reuters) - A hungry burglar more interested in food than glittering jewelry broke into nearly a dozen Seattle homes in the last week to gobble down vast quantities of food before being arrested, police said on Wednesday.  In one instance the ravenous burglar consumed six shrimp kebabs, a dozen mini corndogs, half a large package of lunch meat, a box of Creamsicles, a dozen clumps of frozen cookie dough, several handfuls of M&Ms, two fruit drinks and a glass of milk, according to Julie Sanchez, one of the burglary victims interviewed on local television. The man, in his late 20s, was not identified by the police since he has not yet been charged with a crime. He was arrested after being caught rifling through a purse at a church in the northern part of Seattle, and his descriptions and belongings matched evidence from the burglaries. "It's unusual to the extent that food appeared to his main motive," said Seattle police spokeswoman Christina Bartlett. In some cases, the burglar grabbed readily available cash from the homes he invaded, but usually left other items, such as Sanchez's three-diamond ring and earrings, untouched on the kitchen table. In another break-in, the burglar thawed frozen steaks, fried them, and ate them while watching television until being found by the returning homeowners and chased away, according to police.    This happened near where I live, it was all over the news before they caught him.  It is hard to imagine sleeping through someone raiding your kitchen.

      Md. Courthouse Employees Hunt Ghost Fri Aug 6, 9:27 PM ET CHESTERTOWN, Md. - The word "ghost" is hot on the lips of Kent County Court House employees. A new $75,000 security system installed July 1 hasn't caught any criminals, but it did capture some haunting images of what appears to be a strange light "walking" in one stairwell.  "It didn't show up to the eye, but it showed up on tape," said security officer Phillip Price. Security personnel first saw the light while looking at a surveillance tape recorded July 29, and it appeared live for more than an hour the next day. After noticing the light, Price walked up the stairs and didn't see a thing. But downstairs, where by then a crowd of employees had gathered to watch, the video monitor revealed the strange light proceeding ahead of Price, stopping when he stopped and starting when he started. At one point, those watching the video feed saw Price walk through the anomaly, they said. That was about the time that Price said he felt something. "I felt a real chill, I will tell you that," Price said. This time of year, the courthouse stairway is warm and muggy, and Price said he doesn't have much time for ghosts. Officials are still trying to find a scientific explanation for the anomaly, such as dust spots on the camera lens or a malfunctioning battery. A digital copy of the data has been sent to Atlantic Security, the firm that installed the cameras. Kent County Sheriff John F. Price said he doesn't believe in ghosts. "There has to be a logical explanation," he said, adding "I'm keeping an open mind." Employees said they have seen odd shadows and heard unexplained noises including the sound of closing doors when no one else was around. For those who believe in the paranormal, the image on the courthouse security camera is described by the Maryland Ghost and Spirit Association as an "orb," which some believe represent the soul of a person who has died. If that's true, there could be dozens of explanations as the courthouse has been the site of executions dating back to 1746. A 1969 expansion was also built over a forgotten 19th century cemetery. "If it is a ghost, it's a friendly ghost," said Mark Mumford, clerk of the circuit court. "If it's a friendly ghost, it's not hurting me."   This is sooo creepy to me, I can't belive they built over a cemetery.  If it was forgotten how when did they relize it was there.  This kind of stuff scares the heck out of me, I cannot watch or read any ghost true story movies etc because I will not be able to sleep lol.

       urlLink   Bad Hubbies Try to Win Back Wives in TV Show Mon Aug 9, 8:02 AM ET BERLIN (Reuters) - A German reality television show will whip misbehaving husbands into shape in a physical and psychological battle to win back their wives, show producers said on Friday.  "Kaempf um deine Frau" (Fight for Your Wife), due to launch in September, follows the lives of 12 men in a rigorous 10-week training camp to kick bad habits whilst improving fitness, self-discipline and self-confidence. "These men have been chucked out by their wives for impossible behavior: being couch potatoes, unfaithful or totally uncommunicative," said Dieter Zurstrafenen, a spokesman for the show's producers, Sat 1. "They have made the first step but their ultimate goal is to turn themselves into attractive partners again." The wives scrutinize their husbands' performance during the show. The winner, picked by viewers, gets to ask his wife: "Will you have me back?" Producers said the show had already received 5,000 applications despite the absence of any cash prizes. "It's all about love, not material gain, which makes it so popular," Zurstrafenen said.        I know it's terrible but this sounds so funny to me, I love the part where the wives  scrutinize thier husbands lol.

      LONDON (Reuters) - Traces of the anti-depressant Prozac have been found in Britain's drinking water supply, setting off alarm bells with environmentalists concerned about potentially toxic effects.  The Observer newspaper said Sunday that a report by the government's environment watchdog found Prozac was building up in river systems and groundwater used for drinking supplies. The exact quantity of Prozac in the drinking water was unknown, but the Environment Agency's report concluded Prozac could be potentially toxic in the water table. Experts say that Prozac finds its way into rivers and water systems from treated sewage water, and some believe the drugs could affect reproductive ability. A spokesman for Britain's Drinking Water Inspectorate said Prozac was likely to be found in a considerably watered down form that was unlikely to pose a health risk. "It is extremely unlikely that there is a risk, as such drugs are excreted in very low concentrations," the spokesman said. "Advanced treatment processes installed for pesticide removal are effective in removing drug residues." But environmentalists called for an urgent investigation into the findings. Norman Baker, environment spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said it looked "like a case of hidden mass medication upon the unsuspecting public." "It is alarming that there is no monitoring of levels of Prozac and other pharmacy residues in our drinking water," he told the Observer. The Environment Agency has held a series of meetings with the pharmaceutical industry to discuss any repercussions for human health or the ecosystem, the Observer said. Prescription of anti-depressants has surged in Britain. In the decade up to 2001, overall prescriptions of antidepressants rose from 9 million to 24 million a year, the paper said.

      I begged my husband to let me get a littermaid before we moved into our new house. I thought it would be great, I pictured never having to clean the box and the lovely fresh air of no cat box smell. That is not how it has turned out, the darn thing smells more than a regular box. It has a rake that rakes the waste into a box called the waste resepticle and the problem is that all that waste really starts to smell before it gets full. The way the thing is designed it really does not seal the box between rakings so the smell gets out. I have the mega model littermaid and it takes a week for the waste box to get full and the boxes are expensive so I do not want to change it unless it is full. The other problem with this darn thing is it does not get all the clumps out and ends up breaking them into smaller pieces that it cant not pick up or else the clumps get totally stuck to the bottem and I have to scrape them off so the rake can pick them up. The only place I have room in a bathroom for the box is my master bathroom and the cats seem to love to use it at three in the morning. The motor on that thing is pretty darn loud at that time of night lol. This leads to my other problem, Scarlet thinks that when I go to bed it is time to play. She is constantly jumping on the bed and attacking me and after she peed on my bed I can not sleep if she is in it even if she is not attacking because I'm paranoid she is going to pee again. I can not lock her out of my room at night because of the litterbox and if I lock her in the bathroom she keeps me up meowing and scratching at the door. I tried making sure she used the box then locking her out but I discovered she was peeing on my magizine and newspaper pile I keep in the corner under an endtable. At this point I'm ready to throw Scarlet and the littermaid out in the garage. At least I know luna my older cat can hold it all night. My room smells, my magizines smell and I can not get any sleep ugh.

      By Kevin Smith DUBLIN (Reuters) - Atlantis, the legendary island nation over whose existence controversy has raged for thousands of years, was actually Ireland, according to a new theory by a Swedish scientist.  urlLink   Atlantis, the Greek philosopher Plato wrote in 360 BC, was an island in the Atlantic Ocean where an advanced civilization developed some 11,500 years ago until it was hit by a cataclysmic natural disaster and sank beneath the waves. Geographer Ulf Erlingsson, whose book explaining his theory will be published next month, says the measurements, geography, and landscape of Atlantis as described by Plato match Ireland almost exactly. "I am amazed no one has come up with this before, it's incredible," he told Reuters. "Just like Atlantis, Ireland is 300 miles long, 200 miles wide, and widest across the middle. They both have a central plain surrounded by mountains. "I've looked at geographical data from the rest of the world and of the 50 largest islands there is only one that has a plain in the middle -- Ireland." Erlingsson believes the idea that Atlantis sank came from the fate of Dogger Bank, an isolated shoal in the North Sea, about 60 miles off the northeastern coast of England, which sank after being hit by a huge floodwave around 6,100 BC. "I suspect that myth came from Ireland and it derives from Dogger Bank. I think the memory of Dogger Bank was probably preserved in Ireland for around 3,000 years and became mixed up with the story of Atlantis," he said. Erlingsson links the boundaries of the Atlantic Empire, as outlined by Plato, with the geographic distribution of megalithic monuments in Europe and Northern Africa, matching Atlantis' temples with well-known burial sites at Newgrange and Knowth, north of Dublin, which pre-date the pyramids. His book, "Atlantis from a Geographer's Perspective: Mapping the Fairy Land," calculates the probability Plato would have had access to geographical data about Ireland as 99.98 percent. Previous theories about Atlantis have suggested it may have been around the Azores islands 900 miles west of the Portuguese coast, or in the Aegean sea. Others locate it solely in the long-decayed brain of Plato.   urlLink http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=570&e=1&amp;u=/nm/ireland_atlantis_dc

      I happened across a tori speical on the trio channel.  They must show her pretty often because I caught a different speical a few weeks ago.  It has live songs with her scarlett's sessions.  I just love the version of crucify she has done on this last tour, it has such a powerful ending.  After Scarlet's sessions they will be showing Tori Amos remixed.  This trio channel is great.
