						   My biggest frustration with wedding planning at this moment is the guest list. I know we really don't need to have that done at this point, but in order to find a place to have the ceremony and reception we need some idea of how many people we want to invite.  But we don't know how many people we can invite until we know how much we can afford, which we won't know until we know how much it is going to cost to feed them.  And let me tell you, it ain't gonna be cheap, no matter how few guests we invite.  I hate money.  So now the questions start... Who do we HAVE TO HAVE? Who would we really like to have? Who would it be nice to have, but maybe we can live without? Who gets a date? Are kids invited?  And if we're not inviting them, what constitutes a "kid"?  Vegas anyone?

						   Hi.  Perhaps you have heard of me.  I am the one who started this whole big thing.  Yup, thats right, its Miels.  Yes, I am happy and excited that this is all happening.  However, I am not ready for all this instant commotion that has occured since I found that Diamond in my rocks.  Dont get me wrong, I am totally psyched to be marrying such a kick ass girl, but getting things like "the best man checklist" from the Maid of Honor 70.5 hours after I propose is a bit "re-donk".  What list might you ask?  Check it out...    IN CASE JAIME HADNT TOLD YOU THERE ARE SOEM REQUIREMENTS FOR YOUR BEST MAN: 1. I MUST LOOK GOOD NEXT TO HIM 2. HE MUST BE TALLER THAN ME (SHOULDT BE HARD) 3. HE HAS TO SMELL GOOD, BUT NOT TOO STRONG 4. I CAN GRAB HIS ASS ALL I WANT(IF I WANT) 5. HE CANT GRAB MINE * 6. HE CANT BE SNIKKIER (I think this means skinnier) THAN ME (I AINT LOOKIN FAT) 7. YOU HAVE TO REALLY REALLY LIKE HIM 8. HE CANT HAVE A PSYCHO JEALOUS GIRL FRIEND 9. IF THERE IS A GF AND SHE GIVES EM SHIT I AM ALLOWED TO FIGHT HER, AND WIN  * = SOME EXCEPTIONS APPLY     Yeah.  Funny.  Unfortunatley though Ash, I think all the people that I would like to have are shorter than you, or at least close to your same height.  However I will do my best to find someone who you will look good next too.    Dont be fooled people, I plan on using this Blob as an outlet to talk about how I feel about this whole she-bang, good, bad or indifferent.  Also, expect random side tracks, such as hunting once it gets here in 113 days.  Anything else, let me know.  Loveyoubye.  P.S.  Make fun of the rocks all you want, but I have found many many bright and brilliant Saphires from my rocks.  If you want some of your own to propose to your girlfriend with (or to look for Sapphires on your own go to  urlLink This Place  and tell em Miels sent ya!

						   Saturday I spent the entire day in bed being a lazy slob. My Mieler, via cell phone on his way home from work, convinced me that although it was 7:00pm, I should take a shower, because we might go get dinner or something. So he came home, and I showered. While I was in the shower, he did a couple scoops of rocks. I was in the bedroom getting dressed, and he called to me "Jaimer, come here, I found a good one!" This is pretty normal, so I went out to the kitchen to see what he found. I was half dressed-jeans, bra, and half-way into a tank top, with a towel on my head. Now the way the rocks work is that he scoops them into a screen and rinses them, then transfers them to a glass pie plate, which he holds over a light to look for sapphires. So anyways, I go to the kitchen and bend down to look in the pie plate and it takes me a little while but then I notice a ring in the middle of the plate.  Me: "What the fuck is that?"  Mieler looks up at me smiling.  Me, smiling: "Seriously, what the fuck is that? Dude. Can I put my clothes on?"  Mieler: "Yeah, go ahead."  Me, now completely in my tank top, still staring at the ring, which he is now holding: "Seriously...Dude, what are you doing?"  Mieler: "I'm asking you to marry me..."  I start tearing up and realize he is waiting for me to say yes. So I say "Well, YA!" and hold out my hand.  Mieler puts the ring on me, and it fits perfectly and is beautiful and sparkly and I cry more and we hug and kiss.  So then I can't find anything to wear that is appropriate for being a FIANCE and he waits patiently while I get ready. I think at that point I said something like "You know we're going to have to go driving all around now, don't you?" which of course he does and we go tell my parents, then his. And scare the crap out of Ashley in the process by leaving this message "Hey Ash, it's your sister. Give me a call on Jon's cell phone as soon as you get this." Of course, Jon's phone doesn't work at mom and dad's, and he left it in the car anyways, so Ashley couldn't reach me, and she doesn't do well with that at all. But we finally got ahold of each other and she got over it.

						   I can count on one hand the number of people from work (family excluded) that will be on The Guest List.  Mr. and Mrs. B are Have To's.  Both The Groom and I would really just prefer they stay home that day, but there's no way to get around the invite.  Next we have the Want To's: Office Manager, who Dad says comes as a single (though she'll probably get the "and guest" invite to be fair), Office Worker Who I Absolutely Love, and Office Worker's Less-Than-Loveable-But-More-Than-Just-Bearable Husband.  That leaves a multitude of people on the Not Invited list.  Unfortunately, I have a feeling at least one of these people - Queen B - is definitely expecting to be Invited.  Hence guilt-stricken Jaime.  Kind of.  The guilt comes from seeing everyone who I know is NOT going to be invited excited about the wedding.  I feel bad when they are asking me questions and I'm thinking  And you won't be there to see it...   Regardless of whether I like them or not, these are the people I spend most of my time with, and this is exciting for them too.  And actually, now that I'm typing this, I think it's less guilt that I feel and more dread.  I am dreading the time when invitations have been sent and the wedding is approaching and certain people (especially Queen B) realize they're not coming.  Not because I am worried about hurt feelings, but because I still have to see these people everyday, and who knows what might have to be dealt with.  And when Office Worker Who I Absolutely Love gets her invitation something is sure to be said innocently enough to the others.  Ugh, the drama.    At least I'll be gone for the after-wedding drama of "How was it?", etc.  Yay honeymoon!

						   We've been engaged for about a month now (actually, I think it's exactly 1 month today...weird).  We are in excellent shape at this point.  The most important thing we still need to work out is the cake.  The baker we knew is no longer a baker, so...if anyone knows a great place for wedding cakes, your suggestions are more than welcome.  And we have plenty of time on that so I am really not concerned.  At this point I'm feeling pretty good.  Pretty much all the pressure is off now, at least for a little while.  According to a variety of bridal checklists we don't really have to do much until like January.   ::Sits back, puts feet up and lets out a relaxed sigh::

						   Earlier today I typed out a nice long post about how we found The Place for the wedding and how it's beautiful and perfect and I love it and Mom cried on the way out (in the car) because she knew it was The Place.  Just as I was about to hit "Publish" my computer froze and I lost the whole thing.  So you get this instead:   The Place   urlLink Portsmouth Country Club .  Thanks to everyone who offered support and suggestions during the search!  PS-For those of you who suggested Spring Hill...It is beautiful and wonderful and seemingly affordable, and it was the next place on my list to look into, but because it's kind of far from my home I figured I'd wait and see how PCC was first.

						   2 non-practicing Catholics seek site for wedding ceremony in August of 2005.  Finding a place to get married is HARD!  The NH seacoast is so beautiful you'd think it would be easy to find a nice place to unite 2 nice people for eternity.  Well let me tell you, it's tough.    Being non-practicing (and non-religious), we are essentially "nothings" and therefore not suitable (and not desirous) of being married in a church.  Neither of us is looking to have a religious ceremony whatsoever.  That leaves us looking for a reception site that is pretty, fairly close, the right size AND also has a ceremony site on the premises that is also pretty and the right size.  And it needs to be available.  AND this place need to be affordable (meaning cheap).    I make it sound worse than it is I think...we've only looked at 5 places I think, with the potential for 1 more, but I just don't know where else to look.  Every place we looked at would be fine, but none of them are SUPER! GREAT! YAY! on all aspects.  Basically, we've foud a place we like, but the ceremony site is not all we'd hoped for.  If we can find an off site ceremony place that's close, we could make this work I think.  I guess at this point we're left with three questions:  What compromises are we willing to make? ,  Where could we have just a ceremony?  and  Is there anyplace left to look for a combo facility?   I'll tell you where we've been...You tell me where else to look.

						   From: Stef Date: Fri Jun 04, 2004 To: Jaime Subject: Re: big news  So it is about time someone made an honest woman of you. Congratulations! So have you actually set a date yet? I haven't read your blog yet but I think it is a good idea to keep a record of your experiences planning it.  So have I met this schmoe yet? When do I get to meet him if I haven't? Are you going to have ugly bridesmaids dresses? (I only ask this cause every bridesmaid dress I have ever seen has been ugly I assume that it is a tradition or something, just don't put a big ol bow on their butts)  I am really excited about this I want to be invited and I want to meet parents and sister and everybody!  Talk soon  Stef  --  I think it is hilarious that he mentioned the dreaded "butt bow".  Don't worry Bridesmaids, I promise no big bows (or big anything) on your butts, or anyplace else.  And screw tradion, I want you girls to look HOT.  Just not as hot as me.  ;)

						   Next week The Fiance and I are on vacation, and we hope to use this time off to visit some prospective wedding sites, and hopefully find The One.  I have done a lot of looking around online, and I have a favorite place.  Hopefully, this place will be both A. Affordable and B. As exciting as its website has led me to believe.  I'll let you know.  I really don't want this to be a retardedly expensive event (the average is like $20,000 -- I'm shooting way below that) but I am disocuraged at the prices of things.  In case you dind't know, weddings are expensive!  Of course, it doesn't help that we want to get married at the most popular time of day on the most popular day of the week in one of the two most popular months (to accomodate a sales force and not interfere with hunting season).  Fortunately, we are going to be saving a lot of money in other areas.  I hope.  I plan on doing the invitations myself, which I think will be way fun.  I have a photographer in my family, and Jon has a baker/cake decorator in his.  We've already decided we want a DJ and no videographer.  And basically we want the whole thing to be simple and classy, yet fun.  Nothing extravagant.  So hopefully we can throw a little more cash (more than we thought, not more thant he average) into the food/reception site.  Hopefully.

						   Well, I didn't find The Dress, but I have definitely decided on The Neckline, The Cut and The Level of Decoration.  Hopefully, some designer out there makes it.  And hopefully some shop around here sells it.  And, here's the big one, hopefully it's in my price range.   A couple other updates: We are  thisclose  to hiring a DJ.  A friend of Jon's family is in the biz, and it's just a matter of going to see him at someone else's wedding (weird, I know, but common I guess) to make sure he's what we want, eventhough we already know he is.  Then there's just the matter of paying the deposit and signing the contract.  Mere formality.  We've also got the baker taken care of, thanks to my friendly coworker with a "perfectionst" son a year out of culinary school who does wedding and anniversary cakes.  Zach "does great work", "loves a challenge", and will do "anything you want, just bring him pictures and tell him the flavor".  So, for those of you keeping score at home we have: The Place The Photographer The DJ  The Cake  Not too bad for a wedding that's still over a year away.

						   Tonight, I am going to try on wedding dresses for the first time.  I need a wedding dress, because I'm getting married.  It still hasn't fully sunk in.  Trying on dresses though...man...I'll probably cry.      I'll let you know how it goes (without being too specific, as the fiance can't know too much about The Dress...don't even think about seeing a picture up here!).

						   Since everyone's been to weddings and seen things they liked and didn't like, and since everyone seems to want to talk about my wedding ALL THE TIME, I've decided to make the best of it and take advantage of this wealth of knowledge.  So I am hereby officially opening up the comments section to unsolicited advice (although I suppose now it is "solicited").  The rules: 1. Nobody will be hurt or offended if their idea does not make it to the wedding. 2. Nobody will make fun of anyone else's ideas (but feel free to disagree politely). 3. This is a NO PRESSURE ZONE.  Some things to offer ideas on: *Music-wedding song, father daughter dance, etc *Cake-anyone know a great baker/decorator? *What to name the tables instead of numbers (for example, romantic cities around the world) *Personal touches/unique ideas *"I saw this one time and thought it was awesome/horrible..."  Go to town kids!
