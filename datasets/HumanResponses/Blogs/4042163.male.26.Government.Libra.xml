      So we put a man on the moon. So we landed a little remote controlled explorer thingy on Mars. So we have invented crazy-ass computer chips that can perform endless tasks at mind-blowing speeds. It slices, dices, copies, collates, now money down, no down payment, do not pay until 2002, sell your soul and go shopping. Ok, all these technological advances are really great and all, and the further we explore the dark reaches of space, the further we get from the real final frontier. Think about it, if thereís one thing that we should be exploring and learning about its our very own minds.   Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls, the brain is the most amazing thing. Like we may find Martians some day, but you know whatís gonna happen? They're just gonna laugh at us and our puny little underdeveloped minds, then theyíll probably kill us and use our bodies for surfboards. Ok, that may not happen, but the sad fact of the matter is that we as a race only use an estimated 10% of our brains capacity. It is said that if we pushed it up to 20% we could hold 4 or 5 law degrees and memorize the Tokyo phone book. Now thatís using your melon. Just imagine what human kind could achieve mentally if we exploited 50% of our mental capacity. Wow, we could probably communicate telepathically, and cheat on tests and bend spoons and spontaneously ignite people we donít really like on fire.   We as humans have been barking up the wrong tree for quite some time now. Some think that the industrial revolution was actually a big step backward for it encouraged machinery and hence laziness. Sure we can nuke TV dinners and enjoy high speed cable Internet connections but we failed to develop the greatest computer of all; our minds. Speaking from an evolutionary point of view, we can see that with time our foreheads stopped sloping; due to the recession of clubbing wars...   [TANGENT!] Don't you think that clubbing theses days, as in getting squirly drunk and trying to score equates with the old OOGA BOOGA days when clubbing actually meant knocking a woman out and dragging her home by her hair... I mean alcohol is the modern day club... see both give you a headache the next morning, but at least weíve evolved enough to take a cab home seeing as itís not easy dragging drunken women around by their hair...not that Iíve tried it...lately. SO where was I? Oh yeah, sloping foreheads and enlarged canine teeth, have been left behind since we stopped eating raw yak meat. If these types of trends continue, our fingers will develop nicely since we use them more and more, and other such faculties like our toes, our hair and our BRAIN will fall by the wayside. But thatís ok right? Cause the sun still shines, the WWF is still on every week and there an American flag somewhere on the moon.   So what can we do about it? Nothing. Well, at least not in our lifetimes. There still isnít a sure fire way to increase brain capacity. Now it is true that people drill holes into their heads to create more blood and oxygen flow hence supposedly increasing their brain capacity, but yeah..drilling holes? Not for me..not now. Perhaps next Friday but not now. So the best that Fadniz can suggest is to read, to learn, to stay away from all forms of professional wrestling, no matter what The Rock says, pay attention in school, try to see things from different perspectives (this doesnít mean standing on your head and staring out the window), and try to learn from all experiences no matter how useless they may seem.

      Two-headed monsters arguing over cooperation. Egomaniac overweight pigs karate chopping spineless frogs in trench coats. Over-sensitive red furry spazzoids who always want to be hugged and played with. Sound like a bad acid trip? Well it isn't. It's the insanity that you watched everyday as a child. It came from the mind of a true revolutionary. The man and his Muppets. It's Sesame Street.    It's pretty obvious that Sesame Street taught youth the fundamentals or reading, writing and arithmetic, but it also gave us a direct insight into the complex minds of Muppetkind. WHICH, coincidentally are strikingly similar to our own intricate minds. I'm not saying that there's a little muppet in all of us....wait a minute... yes I am. Especially in the area of so called mental illnesses. What the hell are you talking about Fadniz?!! Just shut up and listen. Shh!   Hey, where did bag of Oreos go? Who keeps beating up the Girl Guides? Follow the chocolate chip trail... COOOOKIE!!!! C is for compulsive overeater. Now Cookie Monster had some serious issues. His 'love' cookies seems to be the bi-product of frustration. I mean muppets deal with trauma in different ways. Cookie is obviously upset that he has a minuscule vocabulary and is limited to such utterings as: "Coooookie, ME WANT COOOOKIE, and AARggummmuugh." Also it doesn't help that he also exhibits telltale signs of Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). To compensate for his illnesses Cookie developed an compulsive eating Dissorder, thus making him the scorn of cookie consumers everywhere. I say this because we never actually saw Cookie purchase cookies. Even though Hooper's store was right there the whole time. He never bought a single bag. Rumour has it that Cookie's rogue cookie theft led the eventual divorce of Ernie and Bert.   You frog-abusing loud-mouthed porker! Moi? You over-aggressive egomaniac snob! Moi? Yes YOU! I don't know about the rest of you, but I always hated that fat 'bringing-home-the-bacon' witch. I mean leave that poor frog alone. Don't you know that it's hard enough being green? She though of her self as a star yes she always sang off key and she didn't really look that great in an evening gown. In fact the only the she had going for her was her killer right hook, ask Kermie.  Miss Piggy was your typical modern day snob. We can learn a lot from her though. Like how not to act socially, how not to treat our significant others, and how cheesecake goes right to our thighs.  The list goes on and on, ever Sesame Street muppets were all somehow messed up. Somehow strange and unusual. Somehow Human. Rather then attacking their deficiencies in detail, I'll just enumerate some of the illnesses and subsequent effects that were present.      Grover: ADD/ADHD, Made a horrible waitor. Double jointed shoulder and elbows.  Snuffy: Crossbred between a grizzly bear and an African Elephant. Clinically Depressed Overgrown Canary Fetish.   Oscar: Social Dissorder. Somehow discovered how to fit amazing amounts of 'trash' in a single can. Worm Fetish.. (yeah you remember that inch-worm, Slimey..well you don't wanna know how he got that name)   Bert: Closet Homosexual. Pigeon Fetish. Addicted to checkers. Trapped in a loveless relationship (duh..separate beds). Basically wasn't getting any.   2 Headed Monster: Schitzophrenia...obviously.  Elmo: Neglected as a young muppet. Craves attention and friendship. Will probably die hitchhiking 'following that Bird."   Big Bird: BIG BABY!!! any creature over 8 ft. in height shouldn't sleep with a teddy bear.     Apart from the obvious educational values of Sesame Street, the show was used to scare children into not becoming like their muppet idols. Like who wants to play checkers with pigeons or resort to a life of Oreo theft? Not I. The muppets were utilized to show the downside of society. I mean what did Big Bird pay in rent? He lived on the street?! Apparently all the muppets were homeless, save for Ernie and Bert. We don't want homelessness for our youth. What this really all comes down to is it's very important to be nice to frogs. To not steal cookies. To be nice to passers-by, and to not underestimate the brain power of your average urban pigeon.  Next time: The Subtle Eroticism of Gonzo's Nose.   Questions? Comments? Wet Dreams about Ernie and his rubber ducky? Feel free to pass them along, I'll supply the Kleenex.

      So here we are, yes our paths have crossed again.  Familiar, foreign, lover, soul mate, friend.  What once was mine, yes mine alone is spent.  A love like yours quite worthy to defend.   It’s a matter of time  When will I be right?   When habits form its harder to break free.  Mouth open wide; yes pay the lion’s fee.  The memories still fresh inside my mind,  Don’t know what’s ahead, did I leave fate behind?   It’s just a matter of time.  When will I be right?   [  urlLink fadniz  ]

      I remember spending days in the sun, With the beautiful Isabelle Hun. We loved each other right from the start, And the memory of her will live forever in my heart. Days on end we would spend frolicking without care, Even if people did stop, snicker, and stare. We would ride bikes, fly kites, take hikes, anything our hearts did desire, Until that fateful day when we sat too close to that campfire. Now, each moment that passes I wish she were here with me today, And that I had not made her out of paper mache.  Paper mache and chicken wire mostly. Some straw also.

      The only sound breaking the silence was the intermittent machine gun chatter of the American soldier being sold on the terrace landing by a young man with brown skin wearing a white ball cap, dark jeans and a black leather jacket.  The rest of the plaza buzzed quietly with the indistinguishable sounds of midday traffic.  Two nuns pass the infantryman, pretending no to notice but secretly being offended by the implication of this seemingly insignificant little toy managed to pierce everyone’s consciousness with its imaginary bullets.  “Ratatatatatat…..”, it went. “Ratatatatatat…..”, “Ratatatatatat…..”.  New eyes turned to look with every audio onslaught, and people all-around the plaza were assaulted.  A young girl walked by the toy guerrilla and playfully fell to the ground, mortally wounded by the indiscriminate attacks.  And the overpriced mercenary carried on its assault, indiscriminately shooting all whose path it crossed as it circled slowly around the landing, drawn persistently to the right by a mechanical failure which caused its right leg to drag imperceptibly.  From the curved stairway where I watch this battery-operated solder lay siege to a wedding party taking professional photos, to a group of high-schoolers eating lunch, and to the flood of tourists passing through the terrace, I walked down to where the young man stood watching his vigilante with a bored look on his face.  After a heated debate, I managed to convince him to sell me the toy for the insulting price of two Euros.  All eyes on the landing were already fixed on us, as the volume of the salesman’s voice had raised in proportion to the decrease in price I had negotiated.  By the time I handed him his fee, he was practically yelling at me, so it wasn’t even necessary for me to call attention to the spectacle I was about to perform:  With my hands in the air, I spun slowly around in a circle, making sure everyone could clearly see the miniature guerrilla crawling away from me in its crippled gait.  Theatrically, I threw my head back as I stood over my newly acquired mercenary, and making twin Vs with my index and middle fingers, thrust both of my hands into the clear blue sky.  Then, with a blood-curdling scream, I raised my foot as high as I could and brought it crashing down on the plastic back of the terror of the terrace.    Instantly silence reigned.  Time seemed to stop, and the looks of surprise froze on people’s faces as a deafening silence surrounded them.  A single white dove, startled into the sky by the explosive beat of my foot, flew through my raised arms and I followed it with my eyes until it disappeared into the blazing sun.  When I turned back to the terrace, sound had returned and the looks on people’s face had returned to normal.  With my hands still raised in a V, I exited stage left and peace reigned on the Spanish steps in Rome.  [  urlLink s2  ]

        &nbsp;It's late, very late; so late that it's early. Yet, sleep evades me. I'll watch TV. I mean the cable company is screwing me for $40/ month so I may as well get some use out of it. What's on? Oh yeah THE OLYMPIC GAMES approach!!!! WOW!! Commercialism has hit an all time low.  Commercialism in something as true and as pure as the Olympic Games? uh-huh... It's there all right. Here are a few shockingly painful examples.  First, lets look at all theses new commercials...did you know that corporations like Coca-Cola and Adidas spend more for a 30 second commercial slot during the opening ceremonies than most (AMATEUR) Olympians make in a year? Sad? JAH! That little fact is not even relevant in the bigger picture. The Sporting world is corrupt; it has been for quite some time. Themes like determination, teamwork and training have been replaced by contracts, salary arbitration and incentives. It makes me sick. I was watching NBC last night. It doesn't need to be said that NBC focuses on American athletes and American victories, which is expected. Last night coverage focused on some American swimmer. Obviously, to compete at that level one must be a world-class athlete, and he was. His name isn't important (they never are) what's important is the fact that he won Gold for the good ol' U.S. of A. His name will be in the papers; maybe even on the front page of his town's daily publication, but when the fortnight comes to a conclusion, he will be forgotten... Well at least until 2004.  What burns me is that these athletes are world class, and they still have to work and beg for money just to train and bring home the gold. Joe FatAss sits on the bench donning his Yankees uniform pulling in a healthy $2million/yr. Don't get me wrong, I mean even though I'm fiercely Canadian, I love baseball. The salaries ARE ridiculous. The Canadian Biathlon team posed nude for a Nordic Nudes Calendar to raise funds necessary to train. So sad, but send me the calendar.   The Olympics is a showcase for poor amateur athletes; I hate the fact that professional tennis players are preparing to compete. I hate the Dream Team, they shouldn't be there, It's sick.&nbsp;Shaq&nbsp;makes a disgusting amount of money every year. Does he really need a gold medal to justify his existence? No. You want to impress me Shaq? Try javelin catching, that would impress me AND justify your existence.   Olympic athletes are schoolteachers, police officers, civil servants, and hot dog vendors. They're people who are passionate about their sports and not about the spoils of their talents. If they want to go pro after competing so be it, let them make their money. Capitalism. As for the Olympics, let's keep it amateur; let's do it for the spirit of competition. Competition ISN'T the Dream Team embarrassing the Chinese Basketball team... speaking of which the American coverage of those games are&nbsp;hilarious. The commentators keep referring to 'American Basketball supremacy'... [ TANGENT TIME] LOL, China isn't a 'basketball country'. Lets have a new Olympic games... "The Math and Science Olympics" lets pit American highschool youths against Chinese elementary students. The Chinese would kill. That's not important, what's important is sending over Professional NBA stars to affirm American power. It's Like Korea or Vietnam all over again. We know you're the best USA. We all know.  The competition is dead, for we dunked on their heads.   Money already owns pro sports, lets go for amateurs instead....  What can we do? Well, lets watch the water polo, lets follow the fencing and peek in on the pole vaulting, cheer for your table-tennis tandem, support your amateur athletes, support the true spirit of the Games and don't watch the commercials, because if you do, we might see athletes representing Nike instead of the Netherlands and Adidas instead of Austria.  Let's not let it get that bad.  -Fadniz   Questions? Comments? Raving Disagreements?   [  urlLink fadniz  ]

      I got this string of emails from a friend of mine who works in the government. She sits in a cubicle  next  to recipient/responder. It cracked me up. The kicker is the last line of the email.  When did we become so oblivious to the people around us? When did work turn us into robots who come in, stare at a computer screen all day, and leave without any sense of human contact? We send emails to people who can hear us typing them, and who don't even know we exist.  I changed the names so that she doesn't get in shit, but between you and me, what the fuck?   -----Original Message----- From: Matherson, Marie  Sent: Thursday, July 22, 2004 3:35 PM To: Forsythe, Tom Subject: web site?
