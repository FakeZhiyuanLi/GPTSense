      uhh im sooo bored!! i was suppose 2 go 2 a party at the guy i like's house, but that nvr happened...so here it is 9:30 n im pissed cuz i keep thinkin of how much fun i'd have there. not that i'd actually talk 2 drew, i'd b 2 scared, but i'd have fun with other ppl. it's weird, when im tipsy i can talk 2 almost ne one except drew. i've liked him 4 ever. even when i've had bf's i liked him. n now that theres no one else 2 think about, he's all i can think about. i dont wana like him ne more. it gets 2 b a pain. me feeling this way n not bein able 2 tell him. 2 scared that some girl is gona beat me up 4 telling him (not that they've threatened or ne thing but in my school u either r obssesed with drew, r only friends with him, or u hate him. thas jus how it is) he doesnt even go 2 our school ne more, he's homeschooled now.but he's still at every basketball game n stuff like that, plus he goes 2 my church and he's friends with my brother n im friends with his sister. plus our parents r friends or use 2 b but now with my mom not goin 2 church very much, they dont talk ne more. we use 2 go over 2 their house every morning b4 school in 7th and 8th grade.he was like my best guy friend i told him everything except that i like him n now all we say 2 each other is hi n wats up or how are. yea once in awhile we'll talk about ppl from school but our conversations never last more than a couple minutes. now that i've been talkin 2 some of the girls he hangs out with at chrch more. last week he told missy some stuff, but in school all she said was that he was pissed at how every one thinks that jus cuz he's not all over kelly that he's in a bad mood. then she was like yea n he said some other things that i cant tell ya. i wana kno wat, mayb its cuz im nosy...he told my brother that he sees me as a little sister n he beat up ne one who messes with me. how can he fell that way when we hardly ever talk? is that an excuse, mayb he rly does like me but he doesnt wana tell my brother that...but how could ne guy like me? i mean i dont think im pretty not at all. of course the fact that ppl say shyt about me doesnt help...theres this one girl n it seems like ne one that i like she likes. she's always trying 2 ruin my rep n she totally hates, altho i dont c y, i havent done ne thing 2 her. my mom says its cuz she feels threatened by me. but how could she feel threatened by ugly shy jess? ne ways back 2 drew. i wana tell him that i like him, but he's like hooking up with this girl n waht if he rly does c me as a little sister? then wat? if i told him, then that would b ruined. so i dont kno wat 2 do!! i jus wish i wasnt so shy!! well i better go,i think i wrote enuff, at the end ill write own of my rly bad poems...they suck tho!! lol. lotsa luv, jess  ~i luv u  ~i like u ~i want u ~yet i hate u ~y cant u c ~wat ur doing 2 me ~haunting and taunting ~my every dream ~ holding u only ~to wake up and c ~u'r not here ~and its only me ~u'll nvr kno ~and we'll nvr b ~cuz she likes u  ~and ur not into me  told ya it was bad!!!

      today was a pretty normal day! i went swimmin in the rain! it was fun, i dont kno y but swimmin so rly releiving.when ur by urself, its so peaceful. but when ur with other ppl its rly fun! swimmin in the rain is fun 2, but i dont rly kno y, cuz after u do that, ur throat kills. i love it when its humid outside n the waters cold, u get such a rush when the waters cold u get numb n then u dont feel nething, cold water is kinda like a drug thas not addictive. when its rainin it makes the water colder so then u get more of a rush. so b4 i go ill jus give ya some friendly advice, if ur gona swim when its rainin, make sure u have plenty of cough drops!!lol bunches a love, jess

CandyKisses567:  sure   Thuganomics611:  why does it matter if a majority of guys view you as pretty..or even boneable...you only need 1 guy..lol  CandyKisses567:  idk it jus does    Thuganomics611:  no it doesnt...you need to be happy with yourself before anybody else can be  CandyKisses567:  how can u b happy with urself when u look like a trainwrek?  Thuganomics611:  lol...just because i look like a trainwreck..doesnt mean im gonna go kill myself cause im not happy cause im fugly(not saying you were even implying that)..you can be happy with yourself by knowing each day that you were the best person you could be to everybody you know...it doesnt matter if they liked it or not..you tried..and thats all one can ask from you  CandyKisses567:  well im glad u think like that but it matters 2 me wat ppl think about me   Thuganomics611:  and until you stop that..your not going to be happy  CandyKisses567:  im happy jus not with myself   Thuganomics611:  no your blatently not happy..lol...you should come here sometime..or we can go to starbucks..just so we can sit down and have a talk...so i can look at your pretty face and tell you while looking in your eye that you are possibly one of the most beautiful girls that i have ever seen  CandyKisses567:  lol well thanx but im still not sure if  beleive u, its not that i dont think that u think im pretty its that i dont belevie that other ppl think im pretty   Thuganomics611:  well do a survey then...ill stand up and be like..who thinks they sexy bitch is pretty...?..and they'll all raise their hands..lol  CandyKisses567:  lol doubt it u only saw me once, how can u b so sure?   Thuganomics611:  because...im good at this stuff..ask anybody...i know its true jess...see what you need is a guy like me...somebody that treats you like the goddess that you are...maybe not the best looking..but gots a hell of a personality for ya  CandyKisses567:  yea but u only saw me once n u only saw guys around me once how do u kno?   Thuganomics611:  ive seen you more than once..i still have the pic...and i just know..theres just somethings ya gotta trust me on..this is one of them  CandyKisses567:  ok so u have my pic but that doesnt show how guys act towards me   Thuganomics611:  ok jess..when do you want to get together..so i can prove it to you?  CandyKisses567:  no! lol u've already proved u think i am, but that doesnt say nething about others   Thuganomics611:  i didnt mean meet up with me to have sex..lol..i meant meet up with me..so we can walk around and ill show you what other guys think of you  CandyKisses567:  oo i thought u were still talkin about the down on my knees thing lol i still wana kno how u can b so sure when u'v only seen me around others once   Thuganomics611:  thats why i say..when do you want to meet up..i can show you \what others think of you  CandyKisses567:  no cuz then they're gona b like eww   Thuganomics611:  no they wont..people arnt that rude  CandyKisses567:  ok so they'd lie w/e same thing    Thuganomics611:  no they wouldnt...youd be surprised  CandyKisses567:  how come u seem so sure?   Thuganomics611:  because i am so sure..hows friday for you?  CandyKisses567:  cant   Thuganomics611:  y  CandyKisses567:  but y?   CandyKisses567:  cuz my mom wouldnt let me   Thuganomics611:  why am i so sure?..its because when i look at you..i know that the stars would fall from the heavens if they knew how beautiful you are..and thats a universal beauty...not just my taste  CandyKisses567:  idk   Thuganomics611:  you may not..but i do  CandyKisses567:  how tho i mean...   Thuganomics611:  read what i just wrote  CandyKisses567:  i did   Thuganomics611:  that proves it...a universal beauty means that theres a 99.9 chance that theres plenty of guys out there that feel the same way i do..but just wont say it  CandyKisses567:  well y wont they say it?   Thuganomics611:  most of the time they are too scared  CandyKisses567:  y would they b scared?   Thuganomics611:  guys arnt very courageous..they are always afraid of being shot down..they are afriad youll laugh at them..stuff like that  CandyKisses567:  well so r gurls    Thuganomics611:  there ya go..theres your reason  CandyKisses567:  my reason 4 wat?   Thuganomics611:  for how i know and for why they wont tell you  CandyKisses567:  well then y can they tell other ppl?   Thuganomics611:  its not that they can..its that they do..guys..myself included..are generally morons..they will usually speak whatso n their minds,...but not to the person thats involved in it..lol  CandyKisses567:  huh?   Thuganomics611:  jess..read slower..so you can comprehend what im saying  CandyKisses567:  oo so they tell a girl she's pretty meaning it 4 someone else? is that wat ur sayin?   Thuganomics611:  no...when guys tell you your pretty..they either 1) mean it for you...or 2) are saying it to get in your pants...im saying like guys will go to everybody except for the person and go..damn..that girls fine..or some shit like that  CandyKisses567:  o ok i c steve r u jus tryin 2 get in my pants lol jk but how do i kno when a guy rly means it n when he's jus tryin 2 get in my pants?   Thuganomics611:  ok..when a guy calls you 1)cute...2) a cutey..or 3) a cutie...he doesnt mean it,...never...all the other stuff...if he wont say it while looking into your eyes...if he looks out of the top right corner of his eyes..it means hes lying....if hes constantly moving his eyes or going.//uhh..or ahhhh..stuff like that  CandyKisses567:  o ok but wat if the guys rly good at it n he knos not 2 say that stuff?   Thuganomics611:  you have to use your common sense then...your judgement is the best there is when it comes to people lying to you..so trust your instinct..and if its wrong..then hey...you learned from your mistake..but if its right..you'll feel good about your decision  CandyKisses567:  ok   Thuganomics611:  you seem like your starting to get things and making progress..that makes steve happy:)  CandyKisses567:  yes but i still dont think im as pretty as u make me sound!   Thuganomics611:  well you never will...thats a given..but your just gonna have to accept that people do feel that you are pretty..i cant fix how you view yourself..i can only fix how you view others  CandyKisses567:  ok but i dont c how u can c wat ppl think when i dont    Thuganomics611:  you dont need to understsand my ways of thinking..lol..just trust me..i wont lead you astray from the truth

      well like my title says, life is kinda boring, at least mine is. it jus doesnt seem like im living the life of a normal teen. i dont go 2 parties, not allowed 2 at least i've nvr asked, not allowed 2 date, kno that one 4 sure. nobody calls ne more, i nvr do ne thing fun. i take that back saturday was fun! but that wasnt with friends n ill nvr see the ppl again~ ill xplain later~ i jus wana party 4 like a weekend n hook up with some guy then i dont kno wat, i mean i dont rly take teen relationships that seriously so i dont think ne thing would b 2 long term. so all in all im pretty bored with my life n i dont kno wat 2 do. i jus wana uhhhhhh i dont kno wat i want, n that pisses me off the most, i usually kno wati want n go 4 it till i realize i cant have it, or get it. so not knowing wat i want n not knowing wat 2 do about it makes me very mad n then bored cuz i dont kno wat i want so i jus sit somewhere chewin off my nails which is weird cuz i hate it when ppl do that. i also feel like my friends dont like me 2 much, i mean i kno they invite me 2 do stuff, but sometimes it seems like they dont want me there or like they talk about me behind my back. sometimes i think mayb im a lil 2 i dont wats the word, wild mayb. but im not rly wild ijus like 2 party, thas not wild. plus i dont do it very much, only when i kno i wont get caught~by my mom~ n when i kno about the parties. which is hardly ever, in fact i've only been 2 one real party n that was on saturday. eww my nails r super short now n i hafta re-paint them. yea ppl arent talkin 2 me online either so thas makin me mad. im jus in a rly bad mood 2nite. so everything seems a lil off, i dont kno y am tho cuz i was in a rly good mood earlier. ok im gona go someone is "tellin me how it is" n it kinda made me even more mad.usually i'd jus laff about it but since im not in a laffing mood, im goin!! ~Jess

      wow its been so long since i've been on!! where 2 start...well my great grandma died about a week ago. it was rly hard cuz we were pretty close. it seemed so weird seeing her liieing there in the casket. it didnt rly look like her cuz the makeup was so heavy n her face was 2 full plus she wasnt smiling n even up till those last days in the hospital she was smiling. even tho it didnt look like her u kept expecting her 2 sit up n start laffing n tell everyone it was jus a joke n that u've been punk'd or something. even tho u rly knew that gramma would nvr put ppl thro misery jus 4 a laff. she was always such a sweet kind generous person. she always put others before herself and she found the good in every situation and person. when her son ( my grandpa) get a divorce then later moved into a lady's house that he wasnt married 2, of course she didnt like it, but she nvr told the lady that. she excepted her as a daughter in law. she did the same thing when my mom introduced her boyfriend to the family. i could say so much more about her but i kno i would b here typing all day. i jus wana say that i wouldnt wish a funeral on my wosrt enemy, they're so emotionally draing. u go in thinking that ur gona b fine, then u cry n then ur laffing with ur family. the ur back 2 crying again. its like u cant choose witch emotion u want n u keep going back n forth 4 a week. i wanna say more but alot of ppl r iming me so i hafta talk 2 them. bunches a love, jess
