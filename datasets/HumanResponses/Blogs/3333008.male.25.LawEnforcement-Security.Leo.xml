      Recieved a testimonial from Vincent Lim today at friendster. He said alot about my diet and how he hated me in the beginning and found me to be a different person in the end. But at the end of it all he wised me good luck in SOF. This thing is alot like the Raid Gauloises thing. Having failed something that huge in your life, it bounds to leave a mark on you. I didn't finish learning piano. I didn't beat anybody in any athletic competition. I was good in basketball but didn't pursue any further. Why is it that I can't leave this as it is. It's almost one year to the day of the selection. Do I feel guilty to CPT Quek? Do I owe him to finish this thing? And then what happens after that?  Went out around 1300. Slept the entire journey in the bus. I guess I didn't get enough sleep. Underestimated my sleep deprivation tolerance.

      Finished my Kayaking 2 star course yesterday. Wasn't as excited as I was when I recieved my 1 star. I guess it's because I see cyclist everywhere at Changi and kept thinking about the training I missed. I guess eventually I would go around to 3 star one day.  Everytime I see those 1/6 military figures I would be psyched. Everytime I see a commandos/sof, I would always think about "what if". Reading "The Warrior Elite" by Dick Couch now. Really shouldn't have bought it but had too much time and was at kino, bugis yesterday. I will probably use the time during alert red to do some soul searching.  Found some nice running training tips from triathlete and from the warrior elite book regarding swmiming. Hopefully, it will turn out for the best.  Last week was a stressful week. Isn't it demoralizing that your peers quit on you? Well not me per se, but rather abandoned their duties/stations. Isn't it sad that I'm the few non-regulars present at the training? Ain't it unfair that almost all your men skive? Had heli(chinook) training and coastal hook on thursday and friday. Most of the commanders made themselves unavailable as soon as they heard the lateness of the training. Men as well. Why am I still doing this?  Professionalism? Professionalism is not about doing what you're paid to do. It's about doing what you're supposed to do regardless of pay and welfare. No matter how the job comes about to you. No matter how unfair, crude and silly it is. I guess it's just a matter of facing to my own conscience.  Goh Kiat Wee. I always wondered why Marcus was sent to SISPEC. Why Marcus became a 3SG. Marcus turned out alright. Although he skives now and then. He is a good fella to live with. Then there is Goh.I wonder why I'm so hard on Goh. Really treated him well in the beginning. Didn't find him as irritating now as before. His sight digusts me. I could be the better person. Do I have to pry into everybody's work ethics? Life is easier otherwise. Is life better living in my own world? How could I hope to understand the reasons why a human being skives when I do not demand it upon myself? Everybody is born different? And should I ignore his work ethics. Then I would be oblivious to his existence? I think there would be grudges and unhappiness.  Benny Lim. Had COS on thursday. Have training outfield thursday and friday. Normally, admin spec (Benny Lim) takes over. He has COS on friday. Poor Benny would take over my duties for both days. So you would think. He had his COS swapped with mine, so I could come back on friday night and take over him, because this would be easier. He got other people to do the Friday duty and took off early on friday. I have kayaking course on saturday, early. Because of COS commitments I couldn't sleep early when I came back from training or leave on Friday night. So Benny gained something from this. He swapped his duties such that he could leave for long weekend. I would have normally just come back on thursday and take over then be able to leave on friday night.  Do I bitch alot? Better to say it out then hold it in.

      Ok. This is tiring. It is not easy to kayak. I can ride 150k, swim 1.5 and run a marathon, but this is tiring. Maybe, kayaking like swimming is more about skill than fitness. This is one spot which have me hating it then loving it at the end of it all. Yesterday, we did skills training. It was really a refresher and some fine tuning to our 1 star skill. Too tired to type my blog even after that. Today, did a 6k paddle and some skills... have to write my blog some time.   Weixiong smsed me this morning saying that he got somethign on and can only be there around 12. He didn't show up. Figured he got something on then was too late then decided not to come or he really had something important on. Well, was debating to myself whether if I should continue on with this course and  go with him the next time, but I really want to go for the expedition. Turns out he stayed out late last night drinking with his friends. Oh well, I guess he can't ask me to accompany him for the next 2 star course and I probably have to go 3 star by myself.  Saw a SOF yesterday at Tampines. Really envious of them, wish I could join them...

      Walked from Queensway to Tiong Bahru and back today to wait for food to digest before swimming today. Next time, I'll just stay put some place and slack.  Probably the last time I will ever let my CSM cut my hair. Saw the barber or hair stylist @ QB stressing over what to do with my hair. It turned out fine anyway. Was going to buy some board shorts and shoes but decided against that since I spent so much already on music. My next major purchase will probably be a new bike. Not sure on mountain though.  Totally depress over the fact that an old and fat man can swim faster and further than me in the pool. Boy do I need help in swimming.

      Out of boredom perhaps? Or a sign of willingness to cast off the shackles of bondage?  Did nothing today. Nothing productive that is. If recovering from flu is considered productive then I guess today was with good intention but the result remains to be seen. Reading "Surviving The Toughest Race on Earth" by Martin Dugard. Almost done with the book. While I wouldn't, in the forseeable future, participate in something like Raid Gauloises but it is an interesting read. Almost make you wonder why these folks don't join the Navy SEALS instead and then again they might be freedom loving as I am. =)  Listening to FIR and a bit of Jay Zhou lately, waiting for weekends to come or tomorrow to come. Agonizing to sit out today. Guilty to not swim or run or bike but easy to do, just play with comps. =)

      Thinking of that part in men's health best body book, where they talk about this successful businessman managed to find time from his busy work schedule to workout to get his kind of body. Basically it's about putting everything on schedule so that way you have everything planned and you won't missed it. Anyway tried the method after my lunch (bit late but good anyway). Realised upfront how much time I don't have and come to terms with what I have to do to do all my training today (not alot of free time after that). Everything was going nice today, skipped my last rep of interval running because heart was about to explode. Went up to the pool, saw mediacorp was filming there. Must have to do with the scuba gear I saw earlier on in front of the complex. Anyway realised I forgot to bring my WALLET! Last time it was the shoes and didn't do interval training now it's no money for entrance to pool.Tomorrow's a new day.

      Adrenaline rush. The experience of the environment rushing past you, the risks of an unexpected fall due to the terrain, the upslope your own legs just pushed you up, the downslope your legs attempt to stop you from tumbling down and when you're done you know deep down it won't be the last.

      Can't really stand the fact that I can't run, swim and bike for a while. Did static PT 5 today. Managed to get through it but left wrist strained even more. I think I should have it looked at sometime this week. I WILL run tomorrow morning and swim. Feel like I haven't done enough for the selection. Time's running...  Getting more and more revolted with my dad. I am the one having the eye problem here, I'm not a kid anymore that needs to be told to take care of it and take my medications. What is the purpose in scolding me every turn? What is the purpose of telling the world of my condition, what you think had happened to my eye and that I am still serving NS? I think I showed quite a bit of patience the first day. Exploded on the second day. I think that felt better. Really want to stay away from him. Feel like he is an embarrassment to me. Maybe I will do that to my kids when I have them one day or maybe I will be on the extreme opposite end of how he behaves. Maybe he is doing the exact opposite thing his parents did to him. Who knows. The baggage of your parent's past burdened upon the kids. Maybe he loves me? Showing too much care and concern? I don't really want to acknowledge that. Something deep within of past incidents. Maybe if it's too deep it should be let go. I am sure other people have these issues as well growing up or maybe not. Ugh who cares.

        You'd turn into a Snowleopard! Like a snowleopard you are quiet, shy and not seen much and find it hard to talk to people, but dont really mind being by yourself. However once you have gotten over your shyness and are relaxed you are so different it can be scary! You have a few close friends who can grasp your strange ways. You are generally laid back but when you get angry you get angry and can be very vicious and a force to be recond with, though few people ever see this.    urlLink   What animal would you turn into?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Saturday night. Digesting after dinner. Watching Simpsons on 5. Guo Liang called to play ball @ my place. Feeling hard to reject him I agreed and skipped my 3 hours cycling training. In a little 1 on 1 he dashed past me with his shoulders hitting my left eye and nose. It only left me stunned a few minutes and I felt okay and vision was fine so I continued without bothering too much. Few hours later after seeing him off, I felt my left eye strained so I slept. Woke up with the same thing and I said to myself oh no.... training. Anyway, got refered to SGH by a private physician. Eye specialist was a young petite indian lady w/ thick eyebrows. Rather nice job cept for working on sundays. I think she was refering to her notes or textbook while treating me, not sure if I felt safe but I think it's okay. Pain in eye kept me from thinking too much anyway. Turns out it was cornea abrasion with slight inflammation. She went through ALOT of eye examinations before finally letting me go. She didn't have the eye examination devices that the taiwanese eye specialist had in ROC in the Heng Chun Christian Hospital. I am still amazed how a small town have a eye specialist let alone a computer that took video stills of your eyeball to help the doc analyse and explain to you what was wrong. Simply dumbfolded then. I should be fine as long as the scratch doesn't grow to be something else or become a scar then I would have a whitish thing from my left eye. She took samples from my left eye with a syringe thingy to let it grow on two disclike plastic containers which they use prbably to grow bacteria in some lab.I think my vision was severly impaired and didn't see it coming when she held a needle in front of my face to take the sample. It was only when she said that she was using a needle then I felt scared. She did made it sound alot worse then it was. It felt like nothing (skilled hands?) but the thought of the process was unnerving. I could only think of just relaxing the whole way and keeping my eyes opened. Well, it's one day training day lost. It is absolutely impossible to swim, cycle or run in my condition. Half happy half sad I guess. Sad as in I lose one day of training for selection. I'm not really that sad for not going for the run but it would be nice to wear the new timex HRM I got for training. Cycling is fun without the traffic lights, swimming is nice without people watching you do drils or trying to beat you to the wall. I kept thinking too much REST! but I just trained yesterday. Good that I can never be satisfied. I resolved then to traing harder and to make full use of whatever time I had to train. It's no holding back now...

      Inching more and more towards favoring life after selection. Not been following strictly to schedule these days(2 days actually) due to laziness and weather. Anyway tomorrow everything will be back on schedule and more or less meeting towards weekly quota.  I guess it doesn't matter if I pass the selection or not as ong as I did gave my best. Anything less would be regrettable. Reminds me of that interview which someone did on this triathlete regarding him being behind this other guy and what he thought about it. To his interviewer he replied that he did everything he could on his nutrition, training schedule and pre-race preparation and the only thing he didn't do to better position himself in this race was to pick better genes by choosing his parents.

      Having didn't do anything yesterday but swimming drills. Figured I must do something today. Did my PT but missed everything else because of rain. Pushed everything in schedule back so taking rest today. This also means going to busy this Sunday. Hope I don't burn out next week.

      'cept for the part without an income. Did level 4 PT this morning(late). Was up watching southpark last night. Did 50 chin-ups prior. Was wondering why I couldn't do my abs exercises well then realised it was the chin-ups doing. I was suffering throughout the exercises but then I kept thinking of that corny line: "Pain is weakness leaving your body". Got me to go through the whole regime but left me wondering at the end whether it will kill me having so much weakness leaving me. Been thinking of tattooing some of those lines onto my arm or something especially: "When the winter cold comes, only the strong will resist the bell". Sometimes I think I am too much into this macho thing or PT thing, becoming a psycho or something. I hear stories of I-used-to-be-a-wimp-and-look-at-me-now stuff to get sick of having to hear it from myself. I love what has happened to me going through all these training, but really I love the pleasure I get out of doing it more. I guess I love the journey more than the finishing line.  Woke up late from my afternoon nap today and decided to do the other 1/3 of my training at queenstown. Prepared my shoes and swimming gear for some interval training at the track and swimming drills at the pool. Didn't realise until I got near the track that I forgot to bring my shoes! Dope. Did the swimming drills anyway, hopeing to end early come back and get to run and bike in one night.  These two thai/indonesian/filipino(who knows) guys came and ask me about how to get to Sim Lim from farrer. I told them that they needed to get down to dunearn and take a bus from there to Sim Lim. So they went across to the opposite bus stop and got redirected back to the bus stop I was waiting(missed my bus while talking to them). Didn't want to repeat myself I directed them to a bus conductor who just got off as they came to ask me again, hoping that he would concur with me. Surprisingly, he told them to go take a bus that goes down to chinatown then to beach road. Yeah, it will take you down to downtown area despite the longer journey, but it still leaves you at a spot at least 1k away from Sim Lim. Maybe it was bad for me not to intervene again, but I think if you have everybody telling them that way you shouldn't tell them the opposite way.  Came back from swimming on a bus and there was this lady in sitting in front of me munching away something. Okay, okay I have some things against fat people. I was then delighted to be in the army and going in(maybe). Keep fit, get away from unhealthy subjects like her or unhealthy living ways.  Only third day of training and I feel eternity has passed by. Things would have zoomed past quick in the army. Iwshed I ha money and more free time to relax in civilian word but too much training to do and too little money to spend around. But life's good, train till you ache then eat and sleep, rinse, repeat.

      Warm up with a 3k+ swim, 100k+ of asphalt zipping past you and a marathon to end it all. Muscles twitching, heavy sweating, salt water and the sun. If one is to celebrate a marathon as a testament to a person's endurance then why not a tri/ironman?

      I have never really treated my service in NS a work life per say. I have seen regulars around and are aware of their working hours and scope. Most are 8-5 or maybe earlier. The only exceptions to these are when you have guard duties, BOS duties, COS duties, DOO duties, or training exrcises. These are short disruptions to your social life. Long disruptions are the overseas exrcises. But they don't usually send you away for more than a month unless there's something else involved. Of course, they will always repay you with offs, but it is always with the mindset of work comes first before everything else. If one can bear the physical and mental stress of being in the military then it isn't so bad. But if you value your personal time/life more than money then it isn't a good thing. On a optimistic viewpoint these disruptions especially the long ones are great to break the monotonous work schedule.It isn't really especially enticing to work in a 9-5 job day in day out everyday, unless they pay you heaps of money for relatively little effort on your part, which makes one wonder why you managed to get it in the first place. Less pay and less effort jobs? Well if I could survive on something like that then I don't think I would mind but have to have an estimate of my expenditures.

      Ah civilian life. It's probably infinite amount of freedom and yet it isn't that much different from getting leaves and offs.The possibility of freedom from responsibilities and duties in the near future is such a relief. I really don't know what to do with it. I know what I don't want to do with it. And then where is my security? My income? My allowance? My safety net? My father? No I won't depend on him.ANd with that there goes my expenditures on CDs, movies, and other extravegant things... at least for the time being.

      I was walking back to my company line after dinner from the cookhouse. Bumped into LTA Liang from S3 Branch. He informed us that the news reported that all of us(commanders) would have our ORD dates brought forward two months. Disbelief, shocked, exuberant, joy. This week has gone by in a flash. First it was confirmed that ADF would pick up our Alert Red duties. Then all NSF commanders who went for Ex. Pegasus and Ex. Goldensand won't be participating in Ex. Buaya2. Alot of gloating at the saps who skived that week. Then now this. A sudden sort of freedom feeling but it doesn't really change my plans for sof.  ORD loh!

      This is from a military/political cartoon (cartoon had 5-panels and what follows is a reasonable description of each panel:   An Army infantry soldier stands in the rain with a large rucksack on his back, weapon in hand, after having marched 12 miles, and says, "This sucks."  An Army Airborne Ranger, standing waist deep in the rain with a 80 pound pack on his back,  weapon in hand, after having jumped from an airplane and marched 18 miles,  says with a smile, "I like the way this sucks!"  A Special Forces soldier lies in the mud, 120 pound pack on his back,  weapon in hand, after swimming 6 miles to shore, crawling through a swamp and  marching 24-miles at night past the enemy positions, says with a grin, while biting the head off a snake "This really sucks, I wish it could suck more....."  An Air Force Pilot flying over the battlefield, the rain is pouring down,  looks down at the soldiers below and says: "Sure sucks down there!"  An Air Force Officer sits in an easy chair in his air conditioned,  carpeted room and says to his friend, "Man.. Cable's out! This sucks!"

      Recently a "Husband Super Store" opened where women could go to choose a husband from among many men. It was out in five floors, with the men increasing in positive attributes as you ascended.   The only rule was, once you opened the door to any floor, you HAD to choose a man from that floor; if you went up a floor, you couldn't go back down except to leave the place, never to return. A couple of girlfriends went to the shopping center to find some husbands...   First floor  The door had a sign saying, "These men have jobs and love kids." The women read the sign and said, "Well, that's better than not having a job or not loving kids, but I wonder what's further up?" So up they went.   Second floor  The sign read, "These men have high paying jobs, love kids, and are extremely good looking." "Hmmm," said the ladies, "But, I wonder what's further up?"   Third floor  This sign read, "These men have high paying jobs, are extremely good looking, love kids and help with the housework." "Wow," said the women, "Very tempting." But there was another floor, so further up they went.   Fourth floor  This door had a sign saying "These men have high paying jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak." "Oh, mercy me," they cried, "Just think what must be awaiting us further on!   So up to the fifth floor they went.   Fifth floor  The sign on that door said, "This floor is empty and exists only to prove that women are impossible to please. The exit is to your left, we hope you fall down the stairs."

      People write blogs about many things. One could probably deduce a person's character's from what he/she blogs. I would for example write about how I ran long yesterday realising that cycling for the same duration would give me the same aerobic workout as running minus the leg poundings. Whereas my sis would write about her religion... mainly. Of course, not many people write about what they really feel deep down inside but it offers an interesting glimpse into their lives.  So what am I interested in? Swimming, runnning, cycling ... just training. Training for? Athletic success? I remember what I used to think. As long as a job gives me freedom to train, I'll be fine. I guess it doens't matter where I am or work. All jobs relatively don't give much time for training. You have to find ways in your schedule to work around. Job satisfaction would be next then.

      Unproductive day today, unless of course I go run after blogging. Today's swim was technical again. Probably getting better but I wouldn't know. Wasn't competing with anybody or timing myself. Swallowed a stomach's worth of water doing the 3 count slide and glide drill. Jumping alot in drills. Probably I'm too self conscious or find doing the other minor drills unimportant. Hopefully, I see more improvement as days go by. Going to run long later then take a break tomorrow.

      Having plenty of offs of late. Doing abit of thinking, abit of bumming. Is the military for me? I had moments of anguish against the system and now sitting in front of my computer I am contemplating a career out of it. There is joy in NS. There is misery as well. Of late, it has been joy more often then not. Now I am working with my BSD trying to get the mplayer and ogle to work. Basically just trying to play dvds on my comp. Lot of reading and coding done. Do I miss this kind of life? No. Wouldn't rather be runnign outside because I ran already. But can't be doing anythign much at this hour.  You know the acne on your face? The one you know you shouldn't scratch in the event in gets worse. But you do touch it because it makes your eyes sore and maybe just maybe it will disappear if you poke it. To feel that's how I feel about challeneges in life. There are those things you fear you might fail and get frustrated at it. But somewhere inside you, you want to overcome them, thinking that's the only way to move forward. We should all move forward right? Why be defeated and stay stagnant?  Well back to being a computer geek for this one night.

      Wonderful week doing alert red. Player risk alot. Played Rachet and Clank and Socom II. But I exercised and ran more. Finished the "The Warrior Elite" book. I think I'm 90% certain what I'm going to do in my next 5 years.  Just one more alert red and we're done. Life will carry on.

      Chatted with ZF yesterday regarding my career and what I wanted to do. He said he hoped I would not regret down the road once I chosen "that" path. Feeling I get is that he thinks that I might one day find it boring as his former friend is now. I didn't think dwell much into regret at that stage until we discussed about RFID after watching the house of flying dagger movie (horrible sums it up about that movie). He talked about emerging technology and how he plans to capitalize on it. I guess I get excited when computing particularly programming comes up in a conversation. Regret: What it could have been. I'll admit this is one aspect which is totally emtional instead of logical. Life is certainly more comfortable and income is better outside and then I'll ask myself money isn't an important aspect right? What about making life easier on oneself?  Funny thing was that I just read about the foreword in this month's issue of pioneer about winners and losers. The whole personal debate by the editor about half praising the commandos and half his own vendetta against people choosing the easy way out aka losers. This also reminds me about how some civilian corporate claiming about how they're successful by having people who don't know when to quit. "Dude, you have not gone through enough to know about hardship". Neither have I and that's why I'm throwing myself into the gauntlet again...  I frown upon sloth and laziness. And that's what I see everyday, whenever I run, whenever I swim and whenever I may roam. Elitist? I could comprehend when one's life is starting to decline and your fitness goes away you start to enjoy life a little. The Jack Lalane? 60 year old guy didn't even until today. But I see obessity, I see slackness, I see macho-wannabes in the young. I believe I have more of a fear of becoming like them than actually despising the lot.  It's not like I am more adept at making war. I'm actually more proficient with computing but then maybe I am already more proficient and interested in this area than I realised.

      Following Richard's suggestion of adding a second tube as a puncture resistant layer, I added a quality tube for my rear tube, which was thicker than most. There was a buldge, which I noticed several minutes into the ride. It worked before so I thought it might last. Enroute to Thomson CC, there was a explosion. I thought nothign of it at first. Maybe it was popped by a snake-bite again. Took the opportunity to remove the resistant layer and changed the tube. It popped again as I fixed the wheel back. I found no potruding spokes so I figured it must be the blown up side wall of the tire. Checked the burst tube and found the hole was an inch wide and what looked like a burst. Called Faruq who lived nearby to help me out. First thing he said was to get the tyres changes. He offered me a ride later to Jimmy's but then Alfred came along and wanted to tag along. I guess I don't work with him anymore so it's fine with me. Apparently there were alot work related grudges between everybody else and Alfred. You don't really know somebody until you actually lived or work with him eh (like in the Army ha ha). Not to burden him with spending an afternoon with Alfred I went to Cycleworx. Well it was really neat stepping into the store. I kinda figure it 's a more geared towards bike racers kind of stores. They mostly have 20 inch tires. Found my 23 and requested to purchase it but they fixed it up for me. I kinda hate bringing my bike to bike stores because I don't think it's a good bike. Steel frame, 105 drive train, cheap fork, cheap drop down bars and SPDs and not to mention I haven't been maintaining this bike for a while. BUT, this young chap wearing oakley's at the shop sort of made me irritated by the shop. Had sort of an elitist sort of attitude. Maybe he isn't the friendly type, I guess that's what happens when you're sort of the quiet type who don't talk to people (note to self). Was thinking of getting abike there one day but nah, I'll go on dreaming about my tri geared bikes and get it from the store near coronation.

      Went for an interview on tuesday. I think it was some verification check thing but turns out I have to go for another interview with the actual company if they select me out of the possible candidates they put forward to them. GL said they earn commision from my pay. I don't really mind as long as I get my pay and some experience. I actually learned alot more about writing a resume from this lady called Vas from Hr Factors than from reading from the net. So it wasn't all so bad. I think tuesday was my "lucky" day. First I got a reply from another company regarding my resume I sent out on moday night then an interview from this company. Luck must be rolling for me on tuesday. I did swim on tuesday but gave up on biking. I don't think I will bike much  even though I really should. But to commit more than 3 hours 3 days a week is abit too much for one aspect of exercise for me. If I do get the job I will sign up for OSIM's tri immediately. It's almost a gurantee that I will sign up for Standard Chartered's Marathon again this year.    Xcom getting boring by the day when my soldiers aren't getting killed and fighting aliens have become routine. Trying to get other games to run but not successful. So been doing more productive things like replanning my static PT thing. Did my new workout today and it was a success. The aches attest to this fact. Learned that Raymong and Alfred are going for the November selection. Great sort of except for the fact that Alfred is going too. Been mean to him but not that he didn't half deserve it. Ah well, forgive and be magnimous.    Ate Kenny Roger's 1/2 chicken today for dinner. Tasted than any regular roasted chicken but still room for improvement but the worse thing was that after 1 1/2 hours fo rest I couldn't run for squat. Struggling through the first hour of the run. I felt like a fat bird trying to fly. Note to self, not to eat big meals prior to workouts.    Let's give xcom one more try or I'm swithing to MOO.

      Went out to swim after lunch and watching episode 1 season 8 of South Park. I love ridiculous things. Hardly intelligent humor but it's funny. I didn't like the sun but the advantage is that hardly anybody use the pool at that time and you get to see some girls sun bathe during these time. Queenstown is a pretty good place to train. Almost everybody sun bathes there and don't use the pool. Only have to put up with the occasional people who love to dip in the pool with sun tan lotion smeared all over their body and the rare occasional guy with hairy legs and ass wearing thongs doing aqua jogging along the breath of the pool cutting into everybody's path. It's great that the world's filled with weirdos and freaks but don't get too close to me to irk me when I train.    Decided to run earlier on then planned since having late dinner. I love running. Travel alot and see alot of things and it's isn't too difficult once you get into the groove. In fact, I always must try to slow down most of the time unless it's the late part of my 2 hours runs. Macritchie's trails are really dark after 7. I can't remember when it rained but the it certinly rained today to have all the trail that muddy. I have to get a pair of trail trainers once I start getting money. WIth people graduating recently, I don't really know whether if I can get a job. Myabe I should just work for pastamania or something.

      Couldn't think of anything to write these days. Too much things on my mind to think. Felt guity about doing almost nothing yesterday. I guess I'm addicted to exercise more than I think. Getting sick of swimming these days. Rather monotonous going about the same routine. I think it's time for a change. Watched the korean movie Bortherhood yesterday. It's worth it. I liked it alot but this guy (probably poly or jc) beside me was laughing at some of the scenes, which were rather touching for me. Maybe I'm too sensitive or maybe I can understand the character's loss in war. I can't wait for this dude to get into army and somebody start screwing with his ass. But then of course, maybe he'll just fake a I-have-a-hole-in-my-heart routine to 'siam' all the tough work in NS. Cest' La Vie.     Ot that nothing interesting happened in my life but I guess I had more to think about these days. Being jobless can do these kind of things to you. Yeah, life would be nice if I had a 9-5 5 days a week kind of job that pays 1500-2000 to begin with. Slowly work your way up to 2500-3000 then life would be nice wouldn't it? Eat Ben & Jerry's everyday. Listen to songs from my iPod, chatting in some mmorpg or playing some game on my Athlon64 box. Maybe even get a motorbike or my first car (not that I would). Life? Asked GL whether if he really considered ZF the most successful among us four. He said he said his life was alright... good enough. He then asked me what I considered as successful in life. I told him to live life happily. He then replied ZF was the most troubled and unhappy one among us. I do envy ZF's life. Seems like his career is set, working with HP getting good pay and even upgrading himself with courses he takes at night. But then I guess it's sad that you don't get to enjoy. Most people would think it's normal to suffer when you're young so you will enjoy when you're old. Then one day while you're crossing the road on your way to night class, a young kid, who just earned his driving license 2 months ago, was celebrating his birthday in a pub by getting dead drunk comes driving down the road and sends you flying. As you lay down on your pool of blood on that stretch of asphalt, you are filled with anger on why is this happening to you? I am too young to die. So much things to do. I haven't enjoyed life yet!    I guess the drunk young punk knocked me down several years ago. I look upon my fellow friends and Singaporeans living in a sedantary life, growing fat, trying to get thin, buying oakley sunglasses (never to really use them except on a once a month 2 hour beach volleyball workout @ sentosa), wearing the new Nike running shoes (to have never really use them ... on a run except maybe to jaywalk) with digust. I always thought I could never be like them. And lately, it has been what's wrong with indulging yourself? Fat Renault automobile salesman at Suntec looks happy with his pda/phone working in an Air-con environment earning a commission worth more than what I could earn in half a years allowance in NS? Skinny female banker looks happy browsing through the latest hip diet/fitness magazine looking for new ways to get even thinner and eating anything she wants while sitting down at Starbucks sipping her latte. Extreme point of views? There are normal people who just work and grow fat (maybe some work out once  in a while, some workout 3 times a week).  Times I feel like I should let go and try to live a civilian life. Life's nice as a student (for me anyway) bumming, playing games, hanging out with friends. But when the student phase is over it seems as though life gets worse.     What am I working for?

      Somebody told my sister that she was obssessed with exercising after she twisted her knee during a badminton match. She thought for it a awhile and didn't think so because she thought I was more obssessed than her. I never really considered myself obssessed until that point. The average Joe/Jane exercises alot less than what I put myself through in a week. I probably exercised alot more in one day than they ever do in a month.  But Tri training involves alot more training than a single sport athelete would and especially since I have to incorporate alot more than just tri. Yes, I do alot more training but then it's more out of neccessity to reach certain goals than out of addiction to exercising.   I attended my sister's convocation on saturday. I have no clue what that word means until I got there and realised it's a graduation ceremony for confering the diploma to the graduates. I never had a convocation. I just had the paper sent to me by mail. Did I regret not attended mine? No, I couldn't stand the phototakings, congratulations, hand-shaking and smiles for something as insignificant as this. I guess I would cherish it alot more if it was worked hard for. I'm not the academic type I guess. I only dwell into things of interest not for the sake of pure academic excellence.  Life's a journey not a destination.

      I think the time hit 2 hours when I reached the end of my ride at Lim Chu Kang Road and going to turn left to Old Chua Chu Kang Road. Saw a maybe cute girl in black (couldn't tell after riding for so long) outside tengah or lim chu kang air base *shrugs* (must be hallucinating at that point). Ride started out riding into rain 30 minutes into the journey. Rain turned to heavy at Nee Soon camp but went away at Mandai. Got sidetracked abit at Woodlands Road but managed to turn back and head towards Kranji then Neo Tiew. THat was like an hour 30? and I was already tired then. Couldn't ride through the slopes but still managed to climb it with stable low cadence. Groin hurt beginning of Lim Chu Kang and ran into a ditch at the beginning. Front rim and tire got scrapped but no punctures just bad scratch marks all over the front rim (and I was thinking of going even narrower?). Chua Chu Kang turned out longer than expected and ended up at Chua Chu Kang. Fortunately, I came by here before so navigation was easy but shack. Really really tired when I hit Upp Bukit Timah. Going realy slow climbing fortunately got pass the two major slopes and reached Dunearn. Went abit faster there at 33 chasiung buses and zooming past bus stops. Probably ego's doign there. Just 2 hours plus and dying. Was thinking how I could run after this in a tri. I think I would do alot better running than cycling this long.

      The Philippines said it has begun pulling its troops out of Iraq to save the life of a Filipino hostage, despite warnings by allies the United States and Australia that it was sending the wrong signal to terrorists. - ChannelNewsAsia.com  I don't know much about Philippines politics or their culture. I know from my standpoint it's a bad move. Not my country, not my friend or family member being held hostage so ....  Funny how these things interest me more than my daily life these days. Doing running and swimming lately, schedule's in havoc because of rain but then you could say these are excuses. I will ride my bike tomorrow. GL told me about this september gathering for ex-BHSS for the school's 60th anniversary and partly to raise funds for the unfortunate. I don't want to go but it's a good opportunity to meet people nevertheless.

      I really should learn to appreciate the world and the living beings around it. Unfortunately this week ain't it.  Should you do something because it is the "right" course of action  despite  your action has no consequence in the result and that everybody is doing the "wrong" thing? So many scenarios, I guess you just have to do what's right and not what's popular and whatever the result. Because if you didn't do it? Nothing will happen. If you did, the chance is there ain't it?  Philipines President Arroyo barely in a second term and already getting heat from the public regarding this particular person being taken hostage by terrorist(non-iraqis?). Well, I agree with her stance of not folding under public pressure and these terorist and sticking by the deadline to pull out troops because you cannot expect the person holding the gun making demands from you to be fair. It's like that turtle soup story. Guy wanted to cook a turtle or tortise for dinner but gives the turtle/tortise this ultimatum. If the turtle/tortise manage to walk across this beam lying across the hot pot of soup then he'll let him go. By doing so, the guy feels guilt free because if the turtle/tortise falls, his bad luck. If the turtle/tortise refuses to walk then it's his choice to die, so the guy would eat him. So, the turtle/tortise did and miraculously made it across. The guy was amazed and told the turtle/tortise to do it again. What did the turtle/tortise did wrong?  The turtle/tortise complied with an unreasonable demand and hope that the other side will keep it's bargain. Anyway, you're not at fault if you don't comply with the demand because you didn't put yourself in that life and death position. THe murderer is still the guy.  So it's alot like a hostage situation where kidnapper points gun at hostage and demands that you the cop to put down your arm so that he/she won't kill the hostage. You shouldn't put your gun down because  you won't be responsible if he/she decides to kill the hostage and you kill him/her in the end. Who is to say that he/she won't shoot you after you put your gun down? Never comply with the unreasonable and expect them to keep their bargain.  Anyway, went shopping at NTUC for apples and pasta (tryign something out to see if it's cheaper to cook your own than to buy). Saw a couple of people buying unhealthy foods like chocolate bars and ice cream. 3 big tubs of ice cream. How much can a prson eat? Higher standards of living, lower standards of health.

      Standing there at the 186 bus stop outside of Queenstown Swimming Pool after my shortened swim (due to lightning), I gazed upon the hundreds of cars passing by me and wondered what a waste of fuel and space to have 1 or 2 people sitting in a car meant for 4? 5? Then looking at the "neverending" stream of these vehicles passing by. What a waste. Of course, we know fuel is limited and we're everyday shortening the supply and don't even start with pollution. I read or heard about this in school ages ago, on how we should conserve our earth's resources, stop global warming, etc. Looking at the evening traffic I think we haven't. "You must learn to drive" is what I heard from my friends in army. I really don't want to. I don't really want to appear like an eco-freak or something and so I just said it's a waste of time, I'll never buy a car. I think car buying is a waste of money, we can always make do without one. I think people who bought cars end up travelling more often because of the increase in convinience and thus "waste" more fuel. "What will happen when your wife gets pregnant?". Yeah, I know I would do alot of things and almost everything to ease her "suffering", but I don't think I'll be making a football team with reserves with my children in the near future. Kids are great but I don't think I can manage or afford so many of them not to mention how humans are already spreading like a virus around the world now. I think I can manage to get her to the hospital without endangering her life during those moments.  The funny thing about this is that Americans are demanding that their government lower oil prices so that they can afford bigger cars. Which begs the quesiton of for what reason? Power of choice? How about be considerate to the rest of the world? and the future of human race? Oh the future's too far away to concern us. It's like I know I'll never get caught and be blamed for not flushing the toilet, so I won't do flush it thinking that the next person to do it won't be of a concern to me. Humans tend to do things to their convinience if they can get away with it.   How should I react to all this? Excommunicate all motor vehicle drivers? Boycott businesses that uses motor vehicles? Knowing something is wrong and not doing anything about it is a crime? Would you befriend a "criminal"? Are you no less a criminal if you do it against your own?  Saw a person wearing a white polo t-shirt with the words "OPS-Tekong Manhunt" on it with a silhouette of 3 person's head and a crosshair in the center. First reaction, it's called ops double hammer buddy. Second reaction, which unit would do something like this? Third reaction, a manhunt in US would be like  the police responding to a family dispute call. It is a huge operation, but then something to be proud of to make a T-shirt so that you can tell the world that you've taken part in it? I know my CO was always telling us how we took part in it blah blah blah. Probably, trying to impress on the ATEC umpires but then ... revolting. I just don't like people boasting about something hardly to be proud of such as this and trying to tell the world by printing a t-shirt about it. Crazy world.

      When you start trotting and you bounce along your route. When you feel like sprinting all the way and actually thinking you can do it. When you feel like chasing the buses. Had one of my best run in a while today. Was actually thinking of giving today a rest but decided against it and went ahead with it. Boy did I feel good.   I love running!

      Finally finished the thing.  According to Tolstoy, he observed 4 kinds of people among his "breed" of people (which somewhat applies to my situation but I can't find the suicidal guys).  1.  Le Ignorant  People who ignore the fact that they will grow old and die one day. They live in a delusional fantasy world and ... they live. 2.  Roller coaster riders  People who accept their fate in life (which is to die) and live life to the fullest or they just live as and how they wish ... maybe not to the fullest but to their desires (catchy category name nevertheless). 3.  Kamikaze advocates  Well I know that term actually means Scared Wind or somewhat but hey history, stigma, whatever, you get the idea. People who see that they will die eventually and life don't seem to have a purpose and they just let go. 4.  Weaklings?  The people who recognizes the fact that they will die, have no desire to enjoy life because of this fate  BUT  do not have the will to commit suicide.  Which one do I belong to? I think I stand halfway between 1 and 2. Why? I know I should enjoy life as principle. Make full use of it. But I don't for everyday. Most days I just slack around waiting for days when I really enjoy. I don't really know how to enjoy life for the most part still figuring that one. If I do get to a state where I become 4 or 3, I'll probably get a religion or something. *shrugs*.   Which one do you belong to?

      I saw that I was lying on a bed. I was neither comfortable nor uncomfortable: I was lying on my back. But I began to consider how, and on what, I was lying - a question which had not till then occurred to me. And observing my bed, I saw I was lying on plaited string supports attached to its sides: my feet were resting on one such support, by calves on another, and my legs felt uncomfortable. I seemed to know that those supports were movable, and with a movement of my foot I pushed away the furthest of them at my feet - - it seemed to me that it would be more comfortable so. But I pushed it away too far and wished to reach it again with my foot, and that movement caused the next support under my calves to slip away also, so that my legs hung in the air. I made a movement with my whole body to adjust myself, fully convinced that I could do so at once; but the movement caused the other supports under me to slip and to become entangled, and I saw that matters were going quite wrong: the whole of the lower part of my body slipped and hung down, though my feet did not reach the ground. I was holding on only by the upper part of my back, and not only did it become uncomfortable but I was even frightened. And then only did I ask myself about something that had not before occurred to me. I asked myself: Where am I and what am I lying on? and I began to look around and first of all to look down in the direction which my body was hanging and whiter I felt I must soon fall. I looked down and did not believe my eyes. I was not only at a height comparable to the height of the highest towers or mountains, but at a height such as I could never have imagined.  I could not even make out whether I saw anything there below, in that bottomless abyss over which I was hanging and whiter I was being drawn. My heart contracted, and I experienced horror. To look thither was terrible. If I looked thither I felt that I should at once slip from the last support and perish. And I did not look. But not to look was still worse, for I thought of what would happen to me directly I fell from the last support. And I felt that from fear I was losing my last supports, and that my back was slowly slipping lower and lower. Another moment and I should drop off. And then it occurred to me that this cannot e real. It is a dream. Wake up! I try to arouse myself but cannot do so. What am I to do? What am I to do? I ask myself, and look upwards. Above, there is also an infinite space. I look into the immensity of sky and try to forget about the immensity below, and I really do forget it. The immensity below repels and frightens me; the immensity above attracts and strengthens me. I am still supported above the abyss by the last supports that have not yet slipped from under me; I know that I am hanging, but I look only upwards and my fear passes. As happens in dreams, a voice says: "Notice this, this is it!" And I look more and more into the infinite above me and feel that I am becoming calm. I remember all that has happened, and remember how it all happened; how I moved my legs, how I hung down, how frightened I was, and how I was saved from fear by looking upwards. And I ask myself: Well, and now am I not hanging just the same? And I do not so much look round as experience with my whole body the point of support on which I am held. I see that I no longer hang as if about to fall, but am firmly held. I ask myself how I am held: I feel about, look round, and see that under me, under the middle of my body, there is one support, and that when I look upwards I lie on it in the position of securest balance, and that it alone gave me support before. And then, as happens in dreams, I imagined the mechanism by means of which I was held; a very natural intelligible, and sure means, though to one awake that mechanism has no sense. I was even surprised in my dream that I had not understood it sooner. It appeared that at my head there was a pillar, and the security of that slender pillar was undoubted though there was nothing to support it. From the pillar a loop hung very ingeniously and yet simply, and if one lay with the middle of one's body in that loop and looked up, there could be no question of falling. This was all clear to me, and I was glad and tranquil. And it seemed as if someone said to me: "See that you remember."

      Every man has come into this world by the will of God. And God has so made man that every man can destroy his soul or save it. The aim of man in life is to save his soul, and to save his soul he must live "godly" and to live "godly" he must renounce all the pleasures of life, must labour, humble himself, suffer, and be merciful.  - Leo Tolstoy

      vanity of vanities - all is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun? One generation passeth away, and another generation commeth: but the earth abideth for ever....The thing that hath been, is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. Is there anything whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. there is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after. I the Preacher was King over Israel in Jerusalem. And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit....I communed with my own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me over Jerusalem: yea, my heart hath great experience of wisdom and knowledge. And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.  "I said in my heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and behold this also is vanity. I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? I sought in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, and while my heart was guided by wisdom, to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven the number of the days of their life. I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards; I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruits: I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared: I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks above all that were before me in Jerusalem: I gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure from kings and from the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers; and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments and all that of all sorts. So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. And whatever mine eyes desired I kept not from them. I withheld not my heart from any joy....Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit from them under the sun. And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly.... But I perceived that one even happeneth to them all. Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me, and why was I then more wise? then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool. Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit. Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.... For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. this is also vanity. Man is not blessed with security that he should eat and drink and cheer his soul from his own labour.... All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the evil; to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event unto all; yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead. For him that is among the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion. For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun."

      The only thing I've been religiously keeping up with is my swimming. Starting to get the hang of it. I still can't really get my cycling training going on as 3 hours is a long time to train. THe worst running could do is the 2 hours run thing Swimming barely reaches 2 hours. Trying to get myself to read that Confession by Leo Tolstoy but haven't found the time to switch on my PDA. Alot of things I buy during those days in NS. Searching through the job listing websites these days, alot of the jobs don't really pay well (unless of course if you're senoir enough) but then the work hours are short and you're out in civilian life. Practically married to the army if you're in the SAF. Yeah, in the long run, a civilian job is better than the military job in terms of pay, free time, work hours, freedom, atmosphere?. I don't know. Maybe I'm doing this for spite or as a principle thing? (not sure what it is). My life would be carefree and relax in civilian life. Of course, I ain't working now. Things could be tougher once that is sorted out. Is this the life I want?

      Officially, I'm a NSmen now. Should be a joyous occasion if it isn't for the fact that I don't know much aobut my future now. Is it good news? Yes and no. I think Yes for the most part as uncertainty is certainly much more interesting than a stable and uneventful life. Air doens't smell better neither does the water taste better now. I think I had no more obligations to the army long time ago when I started training. Thinking about the jobs possibilities. Pretty boring and uneventful. Money's good though. Work hours somewhat good. Why complain? It's even worse than school or army. It's the same everyday. Repetitive work. Sometimes I think life should just be a rollar coaster that ends in turning into a big ball of fire bursting in mid-air like a fireworks display for national day or something but unfortunately life does sometimes continue on after that fantastic display of sound, color and light.  Life will sort itself out.  My blogs are getting less detailed and more vague and philosophical these days.

      It always seems so much easier to make decisions when you're not the person making it. I think especially recently I've seen quite alot of scenarios on TV where it is very easy for me to make a sound decision for the character but then this time round I wondered if I would make that decision if I'm in the situation. Frankly, it would be a emotionally difficult but logically easy decision to make. I guess that's why you seek opinions from other people sometimes.  Better to have tried and failed than to have never tried and wondered what if.

      This morning I went to collect my Pink IC. Found out that chief clerk wasn't home and I would still need to come back on thursday to get the certificate of service. So I got both the pay and doc clerk to sign my clerance and took a ride from Jie Wei home. I called Warrant Loo to find out about my selection application process and he told me they are only mailing it out today so there's no hurry.  Afternoon, woke up from slumber to recieve call from him again asking me about my application and he said he recieved nothing. Long story short, administration cock up and I failed to follow through. Result, I have to come in for the November selection. Xian. Do I still go through with this?   More time to train and still need to find job or just find job and be done with this? Wait till I swim finish then decide.

      Awaken from slumber I ran with minimal gear to the reservoir via road near SMU. Ran anticlockwise from the exercise area at lornie path near sime rd. Saw a group of Gurkhas? Some were wearing PT gear, some singlet/slacks/boots and some wore that with black backpack with alot of sloshing sound (?H2O). Most were asian of probable nepal origin 'cept for one caucasian in the mix running with vest/slacks. No idea how far they were running but I saw them twice so I think it is likely that they are running at least twice and at the speed they were going.... fast. Incredible stamina. Not all were running fast but most are for that kind of distance. A1 the end of my trip, around an hour 40 I got outrunned by an old guy in his 50s? while running at my aerobic zone 145ish. Then got overtaken by this what look like a triathlete guy with fuel belt wearing asics trail eagle or the other way round, whatever. I am still far from ideal.  I will run more.

      Artist: Utada Hikaru Title: 誰かの願いが叶うころ Dareka no Negai ga Kanau Koro (When One Person's Wish Comes)  小さなことで 大事な物を失った 冷たい指輪が 私に光って見せた  今さえあればいい といったけど そうじゃなかった あなたへ続くドアが 音も無く消えた  あなたの幸せ願うほど わがままが 増えていくよ それでも あなたを引き止めたい いつだってそう 誰かの願いが叶うころ あの子が 泣いているよ そのまま 扉の音は鳴らない  皆に必要と去れる 君を癒せる たった一人に なりたくて 少し我慢し過ぎたな  自分の幸せ願うこと わがままでわないでしょ それならあなたを抱き寄せたい 出来るだけぎゅっと 私の涙が乾くころ あの子が 泣いているよ このまま 僕らの地面は 乾かない  あなたの幸せ願うほど わがままが増えていくよ あなたは私を 引き止めない いつだってそう 誰かの願いが叶うころ あの子が泣いているよ 皆の願いは 同時には 叶わない  小さな地球が回るほど 優しさ身につくよ もう一度 あなたを抱きしめたい できるだけ そっと  I lost what was precious over a little thing the cold ring shined before me  I told you 'all I needed was what we have now', but that wasn't the case the door that leads to you, vanished without a sound.   the more I pray for your happiness, the more selfish I get. but still I want to keep you here, that never changes.  when one person's wish comes true, that child is crying and the door never makes a sound.   I guess I held back a little too long, wanting to be the one person who could heal you, the one everyone needs  Wishing for your own happiness isn't a selfish act, is it? If so, I want to hold you close, as tightly as I can.  when my tears have dried, that child is crying at this rate our earth will never be dry  the more I pray for your happiness, the more selfish I get. you can't stop me, you never can. when one person's wish comes true that child is crying not everyone's wish can come true at once  the longer the world turns the more I learn of kindness I want to hold you once more,   as softly as I can.

      Who needs a compass. Screw the GPS. I can't get lost in Singapore. I must have spent like an hour in the bush. It was made worse the fact that I am carrying 16kg+ of weight on my back. While it was certain that I will make my way out eventually, it wasn't comforting being in the bush. Really really REALLY wanted to get out of there and was thinking to myself what the hell was I thinking of comtemplating a career basically spending time in an environment like this? There were times I really wanted to just sit down and rest a while but I kept thinking to myself: I don't have food! Rest to recuperate what? Water isn't going to help much. So I just trekked on. After getting pierced in every part of my body for the time spent inside bashing through vegetation, finally spotted a track. Skipped my bike hill training after I got back. I think my legs got enough work for today. Wanted to get down to camp to give Jie Wei my keys to the locker for his FFI which he left inside then turns out he couldn't get his IC as well so he managed to call me before I took a bus down. Went back to home for a little nooze before deciding to swim. Was having cramps in my fingers prior to napping. FIgured a little rest and food consumed earlier on will do the trick. Woke up tired but still managed to drag myself to the pool. Everytime I cross the bridge leading to the opposit bus stop, I kept thinking to myself whether if I am weaker now or is it really just the training. I never really hopped up the bridge stairs anymore these days. Did the pre-ordained regime with slightly more time then planned but finished it anyway. Hopefully, fitter and technically better.

      It was awful during the run. It felt like I was in BMT again having a routine training run again for our 2.4k struggling past the pavements having people zipping past me. Top that off I felt tired throughout my walk-a-shop trip with GL downtown. I think my legs just gave out. I'm still up now fine and dandy but my legs just let me down.  On the bright side, not watching a movie or going out with Adrian has its benefits. -_^

      I dread long runs. But they're the ones that make the shorter runs enjoyable so I guess that's the price I must pay.  I haven't been dollowing my training regime lately, because there were things on my mind and I think priorities shifted. I still would like to do the tri stuff but not for success but for enjoyment like it started out to be.  Must conform to schedule. Must have less inhabitations. =)

      Talked to the wee hours of the night with sis regarding my major conflict with Dad. Feeling moody and trying to think things through. Starting to lean towards being a teacher and do something worthwhile and meaningful in life. Then unexpectaly, this temp job involves in a project to track logistic supplies pops out and I feel good already especially with prospect of permanent employment. 9-5 job? Desk job? Programming is fun and challenging but is it what I want? If I do get this assignment, I guess I will figure out if I like it.  Volunteering isn't the furthest thing on my mind, selection is.

      So all this research into volunteerism, freedom and alternative lifestyle made me start to think maybe life isn't meant to be so. I felt like being in a cage bound by obligations. Funny thing was that Jonathan said maybe I should talk to my Dad about it. Naively I agreed that maybe it wouldn't hurt to talk to him about it and lay the cards on the table. After advocating honesty and resolution of conflicts by sensible conversation I started to believe my own bullshit would work with Dad. Apparently, it wasn't to be. It used to be I really hate him and don't want to talk to him and then I start to wonder why it always ends up like that and maybe it's my fault...  But after Mom and sister left him because of exactly the same behavior and attitude. "You must think of how most people think and do...". Yeah, if majority of my family members left you, it doesn't say too well of your character does it? Argument begins with me asking him abotu his retirement plans and what my fuiture plans were. I think he keeps what really thinks to himself then as the conversation lengthens you get to sense where he is headed and whta he really thinks by watching his body language and at the moment he blows up what he said. Then Eureka!, that's what you think huh.  This time after the thing, I felt scared to what he might do because he is emotionally unstable and another part feels sad. I'm glad I have my sister. If it weren't, I would be on my own wondering what I'm going to do, whether if I'm alone in this line of thought.  I resolve to be financial independent and not be dependent on him anymore.

      Had this meeting with this Financial advisor from Philip Capital who's a friend of a friend. Funny thing was that they have the same mannerism. Kinda freaky. Anyway, I understand how when you plan for a retirement or have savings for emergencies you must have some kind of plan or idea of the future. Basically I have none, which is a problem. I can't tell you what I want to do in the future. I have never thought about it simply because if there is anything fun or interesting I would like to do when I'm old or in the distant future I would want to do it now or in the near future. There simply isn't anything fun I want to do when I'm in old age. I guess the ideal kind of life would be to earn enough income for my kind of lifestyle and when I"m done with it, hopefully I'll pass away doing something I love (Mountain climbing or something). I guess it's hard for the advisor. I view any kind of bureacracy or capitalistic institution as sort of an evil (neccessary evil maybe?). Is it irresponsible to not think about the future? Well, dependents would argue so I guess. I'm perfectly fine with being care-free. I believe jobs are aplentiful. It just depends on how high of a pay you want. I guess I"m at that stage where I don't think money is all that important. Friends and my sister have told me that opinion would soon change when I start working. Everybody thinks I'm living in dreamworld and it's going to come crashing down when I join the workforce and I'll be where their miserable lives would be at. =)  Should ask my father if he could support himself. I'll just go for a world tour doing odd jobs to pay for air fares or train fares. ha ha

      These are the two things that I would have say influenced my perception of life today. I suppose like inventions it wasn't really a eureka sort of thing but it was a evolution of things to come and Dead Poets Society was the bi g bang, the final solution or summary of what I really thought of life till then.  Tuesdays with Morrie was about life as viewed by Morrie and how he ended it. Not to say that I would like to follow into his footsteps but it was inspirational.  I suppose there is wisom in the bible after all the discussions in the religious study class in U. You can preach and agree to something but never actually doing it is ...  Life is really simple... until society forms. Then you have responsibilities, obligations, bureaucracy, systems, law, punishment, etc. Bondage, shackles, prison...  Army was sort of like a communist "rehabilitation" camp. You get shoved in and screwed around to come out as a tamed law-abiding citizen (more or less).  It's almost like Matrix except that they do it the less subtle way. Citizens are instructed what to learn and which industry to progress towards. It's like growing hamsters and making every subsequent generation learn how to run the newest wheel that will keep their living conditions the way they are if not "better".  Oh yes, Leo Tolstoy. Recent influence. I'm still not convince on his conclusions but I can understand why he chose that path.  But then life is too short to be pondering on what I can't change. I just need to find the red pill....

      Woke up early today. I DID NOT LIKE IT. Had to go to camp today for blood test for the HIV thing for troops training in ROC. Set off late arrived late. Kept thinking: so what are they going to do to me? Extras? Ha. 0900 called Kiat Wee. He said he's been there since 0700 and haven't seen anybody and nobody is doing anything. Told him to go to medical center. Bunch of platoon 2 guys and the regular senior specs and the officer who looked like me was there. My veins were bludging and I got a pretty good medic to take my sample. Even though he isn't too familiar with the procedure like having a gauze or something ready when he decides to pull the needle out, but overall no pain. Can't remember getting poked in the first place though. Might be excitment for getting poke for a very long time. Went to swim later on. Filthy pool they have at Yio Chu Kang. Nice though swimming alone in pool but then didn't have 20 cents for a locker so kinda worried. Understood how my sister felt about losing handphones and IC. Relaly bad if you really have something important to do later on like a job interview. I am soooo getting bored of swimming. Really seriously training to swim is a chore.  Went to eat at Adam's Rd and this guy with a high pitch voice (so high I thought he was a female at first) thought I was a Chinese National or some guy who hang out with Chinese Nationals too much. I thought he was going to say I look like a Japanese or Korean.  Had another nap before the job interview thing. I hate to wear office clothes. The workplace is isolated and doens't appeal to me. I guess I surprise everybody who asked me about my career goals. This one said I should sign on to the Air Force with their better pay. Well, I wish I could tell him it's not about the pay....  Wouldn't it be nice to have your own software development company? I guess I haven't had my fill of fun yet.

      Maybe I dwell too much on subjects that most people don't find interesting or that most people don't like to express their views on these subjects. Saw a sequel to the 101 Philosophical book at MPH Citylink yesterday. Titled 101 Moral Dilemmas. One of these days when I do secure a job it would be a shopping spree downtown. Books! Dumbbells! Magazines! DVDs! I'm surviving quite well actually. 1000 dollars would probaby be what I would have spent in a month during NS days on 800 dollars monthly allowance. Now I only spent 200 most in one month and it wasn't even only basic neccessities. I knew one of these days brining my bike out too much will bring about too much maintenance fee to bear. Of course, it isn't so bad as when I did earn money. Boy, did I spend alot on bike. Spending do make one feel happy sometimes. Like time wasn't wasted on your weekend trips downtown. Materialistic living. Lately , I have been holding back ALOT. Well, there are books I would like to own and can't be borrowed from the Library (in fact most books I like can't be found in the library), but I surpressed those urges. Body still can function without a book right? Yeah, but mind will decay and be deprived. Magazines? Buy Tri mags or runner mags every month or so. Now I don't. I figured I just buy a book on running and tri then just you know actually go training instad of finding new ways to improve my bike. There's only a couple of good ways to do it? So no point subscribing to a monthly article to find out the same things.  I think I would like to pursue a degree in Philosophy down the road. That humanities section at the bookstore with all the philosophical books really appeal to me. I guess those books are available from the library. They don't come out with too many philosophical ideas every month. Input my ATP and 4 weeks training plan to desktop this afternoon. Great to see everything planned for but I know I'll realise how horrible it is when I actually have to follow the schedule. Figured alot of things must have happened during the week, cos it really feels like a month have gone by. I like it this way. Life slowing down. Ha.
