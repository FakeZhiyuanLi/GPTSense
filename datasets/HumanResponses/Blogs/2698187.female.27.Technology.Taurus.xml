      It's snowing here. We'll probably be out of work tomorrow. Good. I REALLY have no desire to go to work. I wouldn't mind just hanging out around here, watching movies all day, just spending time with myself. Minor depression will do that to you.  I hate when I feel this way. It's like my lonlieness just envelopes me. It's overwhelming. How do you become happily single? I want SO bad to be. Really I do. I want to be enjoying my single years...flirting, dating, falling in love, falling out of love. But I'm not. I just feel like there's so much I've missed out on.  I know that a lot of my sadness is about Derreck. I still have not heard from him. Don't know what that's about. I guess I have to admit to myself that I am in love with him. Against my better judgement. You can't control that though. I think that's the difference between loving someone and being IN LOVE with them. Loving someone is a choice. Falling IN love just sorta happens against your better judgement.   I meditated today and the message I came away with was to BE STILL. I am going to try my damndest. I know God has it under control. He has it planned and I'm meddling in his business. But I can't help but to ache with lonlieness. I know deep down that no one can fill this lonlieness but God so I should be seeking Him.   On another note, I am pondering starting to see a career counselor. I know that I want to make a move by the beginning of next year for sure. That way i can enjoy another year of AWS, hopefully have 6 mos experience with a content management system, and have steady employment for the condo purchase. Three years at a job with no upward mobility in sight is long enough. I just don't know what exactly it is that I want to do. So I am going to get some help, get focused over this year. I think that if I get into a job that I actually give a shit about, that will give me some purpose. Make me feel somewhat better. My job isn't half as bad as some people's. But I'm no longer interested, I don't care about half the stuff that goes on around there and that's not right. So it's time to go.   I need at least one thing in my life to look forward to.

      I feel myself sliding towards that depressive state I was in late last year. I'm trying to stop it because I really don't want to go there. I felt pretty low. I think largely a lot of this is about Derreck....and I'm SO tired of it. I'm tired of feeling one way or another about him. I expected him to get in touch by now. At least to say hello. Maybe he is waiting for me to...since I didn't call him on his birthday. WHY am I letting this whole situation affect my moods...a man that I'm not even sure is right for me.  Then I feel like a low down person because I'm not TRULY happy for any of the people that are in relationships right now. I dread Rochal coming back in tomorrow and monopolizing the Internet computer writing her man these long soliloquys. I don't even feel like talking to my mother because everytime I look up, she's running over to Jay's little cramped, messy condo. She has a house. Why does she have to be up over there all the time---because he has a life and she doesn't? She isn't even making an effort to make friends anymore. You know what---all this is just jealousy and I really hate myself for feeling this way. A good person would be happy for others when they find love. It should give you hope....not fill you with resentment. I really don't like this about myself. But I'm human and at least I can admit that I have this problem. That's half the battle.  I'm meeting Mark tomorrow for drinks...a potential new fuck buddy. I'm not even really looking forward to it. For one, I just feel socially awkward around men in general. And two...I don't know, probably because of Derreck. My heart belongs to him. I feel like my body does too in a way. So maybe I should just go through with this so that I can take that "part ownership" away from Derreck. Besides, I haven't slept with another man in 2 years. I'm not used to anything else.  Sigh...this is a FUCKED up entry. I'm really deep in the shithole today.

       Well today was a pretty good day actually. Got my car on time, grocery shopped for pretty healthy foods, had a good workout at Bally's...so on and so on. Just a smooth day. I could really get into this having off thing. It really makes life so much easier when I don't have to go to work.  Spoke to Lynn for a long time today. Told her of my desire to find some new friends. I think she was offended, though she won't admit it. I really meant nothing personal by it. I just want to find someone I truly connect with. She is moving in with this chick that is in love with her...and she just happened to go down on her once. So of course the girl is sprung. I told Lynn that she is getting no where near my kitty. She ain't turning me out! I'm lying. I do want her to do it. Just once. Or twice.....heh, a 26 1/2 year old sista got needs! I needs to find me two steady luvahs this year I know that!  Called a Craigslist girl and I could tell immediately that she was not "it." She must have too because she said she would call me back and she didn't. I think even when she does, I will ignore the call/e-mail. I didn't really feel a connection.  Thought about Derreck a lot today. Wondered briefly if I should have called for his birthday. It's not like he could be mad at me though. I think I've come to the realization that I love him. I really do. I came to that realization the other day I think. I was standing on the train platform and it just came to me...the thought that if his mother was to die suddenly, I would drop everything and go with him to Ala. to be by his side. (Don't ask why I had this particular scenario, long story). But that's love. And even though I am meeting Mark on Wednesday to possibly begin a little "off the bench" relationship, Derreck is still very much always on my mind. I'm hoping Mark will be a nice distraction. I think the true test will be if Mark hits it JUST right, will Derreck still be on my mind. Hmmm.....  Well, back to boring azz work tomorrow. I think I prefer the weekdays though. More structured for me I think.

      I'm sitting here listening to Average White Band's A Love of Your Own...hoping that I'm moving forward towards finding just that....working towards being that. I know that I have a lot of love in my life, people that care about me. But something is still missing. I know that I have to be that love to get that love...work on loving myself first....at least that's what "they" say. But they never really tell you how to get "there." I guess I'm trying to move towards that by taking better care of my body, my health. Being on blood pressure medication at 26 is not loving myself. Being morbidly obese is not loving myself. And I know that, so why am I still secretly yearning for someone to love me when I apparently don't love myself.  Today was an okay eating day. I really need to be working on portion control. I am still eating enough for 5 people. Didn't work out today, but did do some cleaning...mopping, vacuuming so at least I did move. I really like the house when it's clean. I hate it when I let it get filthy. How can I think that I want a serious relationship, marraige...when I can't even keep a house clean? I have so far to go. Anyway, for dinner, again, I pigged out on three big pieces of chicken. I felt sick afterwards. I made the conscious decision to eat three pieces too. Didn't even try to stop myself. But I did drink my h20. It's going to be a slow process. It's only been a week. I can't beat myself up just yet. I did hang up some outfits and set goal dates of when I want to fit into them. Last night, I also wrote down all the reasons that I want to lose weight. They are some very compelling reasons. Should be enough to make me stick to the plan. But I have an addicition....fueled a lot by lonlieness. It's not going to be easy to overcome. I have a lot of people praying for me though.  Today was Derreck's birthday. I didn't call him. I don't know how I feel about that. He didn't call me last year for my birthday so I somehow feel justified...not that two wrongs make that right. But then again, he did tell me that he was sleeping in for his whole birthday. He said he would call if anything changed. The way I look at it, I tried to make a big deal out of it. If he wanted to spend time with me, he would have let me know. I'm tired of forcing myself on him. I can count like one time that he's indicated that he wanted to spend time with me. The rest of the time over this three and a half years, I'm always doing the asking. For once, I want someone to WANT to see me. To call me up on a Wednesday and make plans for us on Friday. To drop me off home from a date and ask when he can see me again. I've never really had that. I just want to date period. Sadly, probably as this weight comes off, I will get just that. Even though I've always been the same person.

      Well, I'm back to journaling again. There has been so much on my mind lately. So much that I want to say but nobody to say it to...or nobody that I want to say it to. So this should be...therapeutic for lack of a better word. I'll probably be using this mostly to talk about my journey toward better health....another attempt to say focused on my goal of losing 150lbs in a year and a half. Wow, to even look at that is scary. That's some people's entire weight. I shouldn't be carrying the weight of two people on my body. So it has to go.  Today was a rough day. Went outside thinking I needed to take the car to the alarm place because the alarm seems to have suddenly died. Turns out the entire car had died. The battery was dead---the same damn battery that I had checked a couple of weeks ago!!!!! So had to have the car towed. And you know as I was standing there, trying to figure out how I was going to get back home, I felt so alone. I had no one to call to come help me out...to at least pick me up. No friend, no man. Or maybe I'm just too independent. I could have called Derreck (you'll be reading that name a LOT). But he's sick and I just don't feel comfortable doing that....though I'm sure he would have come. That's just the kind of person he is. But I just called a cab.   So I spent the rest of the day in the house, watching television. Not really cleaning as I am supposed to. Unfocused on my goal. Made a fatty dinner. But I did make some attempt to control the portion size. I am going to have to start using the portion control plate. Drank enough h20 so I hope that balances it out a bit. I am going to hang up those jeans and that dress I want to get into. I'm also going to take a cab to Bally's tomorrow. I need to stay on task. I need to stay focused.

      Well, it's been a minute huh? A sista don't know how to stay in touch when things are going well huh? Well a lot has gone on. I feel really good about most areas in my life. I feel like I'm moving forward. Careerwise, I'm making some good contacts. Joining BDPA, a black professional org for techies. Going to take a web content class and start getting some practical experience by volunteering. I'm going to hold off on seeing a career counselor just yet. My current job is still just...okay. I'm bored most of the time, but I've got a plan on how to make the most of my remaining time there. So that's good.  Socially, things are picking up again. I've joined some new groups and I have lots of fun things planned. I believe a lot of March is already booked up! I'm more excited about the sorority and I'm beginning to get involved more there.   Mentally, I'm planning to start seeing a psychologist to help me work on some of my issues. My insurance totally pays for it---so why not? Surprisingly, a lot of young women see one. I need to move toward wholeness. I need to work out my issues from the past and work on my weight. Taking care of those two things are what's really going to improve my overall self esteem...and generally my quality of life.  Romantically...well, there's still Derreck. We've seen each other about three times over the past month, which is a lot for us. He was in LA for Vday. He could have called...but didn't. Which is how I know we are FAR from there. But he actually called me up one Wednesday and asked me out on a date for that Friday....sort of! I stayed over and he left me in his house while he went to work the next morning!!! I thought that said a lot. You just don't leave any ole body up in your house. But we are far from getting anywhere. He has a lot of issues that he needs to work on. And so do I. He's not ready and I just have to accept that. I really would like to be dating someone else where it just feels easier to call them up and say let's check out a movie. Let's go hear some music. I could probably do that with Derreck. We just need to have a talk. And we haven't had a chance to do that yet. So right now, I just need to continue working on me.  Well, that's all for now. The cup is definitely half full right now and I feel excited about the possibilities.

      *sigh* *sigh* and *sigh again*  You know, you live for the day when you will be officially part of the grown and sexy club. And when you finally get the fuck there, your ass know you wish you were still happily living off Mommy's allowance.  If it isn't one thing, it's another. I've just come from a dentist appointment to find that I have to pay $700 out of pocket for a procedure. I'm behind on some payments I need to make--renewal of my Cotsco membership; renewal of my AAA membership; paying my goddamn $40 library fine so I can get my read on. I have to literally count every penny and I'm so sick of this shit. But of course I didn't mention that I went out to eat three times this weekend...why? Because that makes me fucking happy. But I don't want to be grown folk and pay a $700 dental bill. Fugged up isn't it?  The biggest thing on my mind is my considering dropping out of the housing market. I just feel like I need to wait. I can't afford a $1300 or $1400 a month housing expense. I don't want to pay that. I can't pay that and travel. I can't pay that and do dinner club. I can't pay that and go see Amel Laurrieux at the Carter Barron or Earth, Wind and Fire at Nissan Pavilion. Blasphemy! So I may wait until I don't have to pay $10K above someone's asking price just for the privilege of living in their shithole that they barely bother to clean. The housing market is some bullshit right now and I'm tired of it. So I'm a homebuyer drop-out.  I've been mean to men lately. A dude came up to me that I do remember seeing somewhere and asked me if he knew me from somewhere. He parked his car to come inside and talk to me and I dissed him hard. He just looked young and full of games and I wasn't interested. I need a MAN to come with the real. Someone on my level. I just feel like I'm going to be mistreated or he's going to be on the DL or something. I'm just in a bad place with men right now. I'm not really interested. Or the ones that interest me don't even look my way. So I think I should just take a sabbatical. I only mildly miss the ding-a-ling. And with these men out here, you gotta worry about dying over that or getting some shit up in your snatch that you can't get rid of. I'm just not feeling it right now.  I had a strange dream the other day during my long catnap that Tyrone of all people called. Then later that night, I was at CVS and I was doing my credit card. I happened to look up for no reason at the cashier's name tag. It read "Dereck." Sigh. WTF? Coincidink?  I am looking forward to a fab-u-lous summer though. It would be nice to have a freak-a-leak so I can be "working that back...don't know how to act..." going slow motion on that niggra. I gotta lot of pent up energy to unleash on the next victim. It's just at a low roar right now. I need someone to reawaken it in me.   Other than that, summer summer summertime is looking alllllright. I got some fun things planned and hope to do some more. I also decided that if I don't get the house this year I'm going to Vegas for New Years Eve and maybe hang out in LA. Shit, I'm not wasting a year of not traveling for a house I never got.  This was a fugged up entry. I'm in a strange place...

       Love won't obey our expectations. It's mystery is pure and absolute...   I just finished watching Bridges of Madison County. I am spent, bleary eyed, and bewildered...so what better time to write. This is my second time seeing this movie and I remember the first time shedding some tears, especially during the scene where they are at the stoplight--should I stay or should I go? This time I SOBBED. Tears were streaming down my face like someone poured a glass of water over my head. I cried so much my head hurts.   I guess its reflective of the state I'm in emotionally now. I want love so badly but I know I first need to love myself and I don't think I totally do. I want someone to love me for my own selfish needs instead of thinking how I can give love. I'm not sure I'm ready to give love in the way that it needs to be given. Yet, still inside of me, there is this burning....    Nobody understands...when a woman makes a choice to marry and have children...in one way her love begins..but in another way it stops. You build a life of details and just stop and stay steady so that your children can move...and when they leave they take your life of details with them. You're expected to move on and you don't remember what it was that moved you...because nobody has asked you in so long...even yourself.     Franchesca, Bridges of Madison County   I wonder if its still 50% of marriages that end in divorce. Is it because nobody stops to think about what it is REALLY about? Most people come into marriage so needy.   When Franchesca said what is written above, I was like ta-da. This is it. This is why I'm not ready. I want to move, I want to be asked what makes me move. Why do you have to get caught up in the details? But you do. And its my responsibility as a wife to tend to those details. My dreams have to be deferred so that my kids can move. That's the sacrifice you make and I think that anyone who believes different is kidding themselves. You may be able to strike some type of balance if you're lucky. But that kid, family..those details come first. That is what we're taxed with in holy matrimony. And I know that's not something I'm immediately prepared to accept.  But what about the meantime? What do I do with all this love I feel I have to give. Turn it inward? Give it to God? Those are the "right" answers. But what do I do with these tears that I've been evidentially holding in for so long? What do I do with this burn?

       urlLink Wednesday Whatevers   1.  Do you prefer happy or sad endings, and why?   Hmmm...depends on much bs went on in between. Sometimes you need to be temporarily sad in order to end up truly happy.  2.  What is the most annoying thing about computers?   The fact that them mofos are considered dinosaurs the minute you take them out of the store....and the way they can just phuck up your whole world by having a nervous breakdown and purging all your important shit.  3.  Who has the biggest influence on the world now?   Hmmm...the Lord because I believe that he's got it all planned out...all under control.

      Well wouldn't you know it. My can't fight off a cold ass is suffering from Saturday. I feel awful. This is going to be a bad one. I tell ya...if I wasn't planning to call in slick next week, I wouldn't go in tomorrow. But a sista hordes her vacation time like a mutha!  Another day, another contract. I put contract #3 down today. A 1 bedroom with a den. Me and my Mom had a tiff because she feels like before I put down a contract, I should know the dimensions of the room. WTF??? I don't give a good goddamn about that shit. It could be fuckxsuck for all I care. All I care about is can I get my shit in there. I have seen this same place furnished and unfurnished. So I know what it is capable of holding. I got real pissy with her...mostly because I'm sick. She said that I sounded like a fool saying that I didn't care what the dimensions were. Tell her to come down here and try holding up getting your offer in to find out the muthafucking dimensions. She has no idea.  I still need to find a mini-me. Someone who likes to do the same things I like to do..and is willing to spend the money to do it. In actuality, I don't have money like I used to anymore. I overdrew my account this month...mainly because fucking Curves decided to be late with taking their money out so I forgot all about them. So in the pinch when I'm trying to stretch $75 for 4 days, they come along and fuck me up. Luckily, nothing bounced because I have my savings to back me up...and I'm not touching my money market. But I still don't like getting embarrased at the grocery store by having my card rejected. Eventually, I think I'm going to have to go into NACA and get my savings amount reduced. It's too much. I can't live like I want to on $300-$400 after the bills/savings are paid. It's summer gotdamnit!  I'm trying to become a mystery shopper. I filled out some of the applications online so I'm just waiting for some assignments. That should be interesting.  I received the invitation to Koritha's shower. I guess I can at least go to that. I haven't heard from her regarding my note about not being able to make her wedding. I don't know what that means. I really don't care though...is that bad? I just can't spend the money. If it was local, yea. But I just don't have the desire to travel to upstate NY for a wedding this year. That's money I don't have.  I look forward to the weekend. Nothing really planned. I get my Sex and the City DVD's from Vange. So if I'm sick, you know what I'll be doing this weekend.

      It's been quite a weekend. Capital Jazz Fest Weekend for us jazz lovers. Yes, I shall mention my love of jazz a few times in our talks together. Robyn came up..and she had a couple of curve balls to throw at me.  Okay, the best one..she ran into Jackie!!! Jackie...probably has been the closest friend I ever had, well one of two. Closer than Robyn in many ways. I find myself not telling Robyn a lot of things for some odd reason. Like this weekend, she asked me about what was going in in my love life. For some reason I didn't feel like telling her. So I sort of lied. I didn't tell her anything about Derreck. Not that there is a whole lot to tell. But I didn't discuss my feelings or anything. I didn't bother to tell her that Al has not totally left the picture. I just didn't feel like it. I don't know if it has to do anything with her constant stupidity when it comes to men. No, that's not it.   But I digress.   Anyway, she ran into Jackie and through a turn of events I actually got to talk to her! I'm excited. When she said "Hi Dani!" That brought back SOOOOO many fond memories. I loved Jackie...in a lot of ways. I still do. And I hope that we can pick up where we left off in a way. I intend to do my part in keeping in touch, at least once a week. When I go down next month, I at least want to do dinner or spend some time at her house just talking and catching up. So I'm excited.  Well, back to Robyn. She's on the verge of being back with that stupid azz Darius. Does it really work the 2nd time around? Why go backwards when she can move forward? I just really need for her to take a break. She has gone from fucked up relationship to fucked up relationship. I think her self esteem is low...although she is quite a looker. When we were at the Capital Jazz Fest, she was in jeans and sneakers, no makeup, hood on her head and dudes were still giving her the eye. I don't know what it is...some women just have "it." Sometimes I wish I had "it." But then again, I'm glad that I haven't been scarred by all those relationships...had all those men pull their dicks out and leave the evil parts of their souls behind...inside of me, for me to absorb and deal with. I don't know. I care for Robyn a lot, but there is just something there that keeps me from considering her my best friend. But then that's my own judgemental shit coming into play too. Who am I to judge her and how she lives her life. Her and Darius are talking marriage. Perhaps it will work. I don't really like that mofo. But I guess I will have to fake it.  Anywho, the jazz fest was rained out again. I froze my bippy off for 8-9 hours. But all in all, I had a good time. I love those type of things, sitting in the park, eating, drinking and listening to good music. Robyn and I were joined by a couple of her friends that came down from NYC and Charlotte. One just left her job to pursue her dreams. That's inspiring....  Al called on Friday night. Said he had been busy and hadn't had time to e-mail me his numbers. Haven't called him back yet. I guess I will tomorrow. Don't want to be rude. To be honest, I'm just not interested. Not attracted to him. But there's some reason that he came back into my life after almost 2 months. So I'll see how this plays out.  Derreck is still kinda on the brain. But he's fading. It was good to hear from him on my bday. But I think I'm feeling like if his feelings were really that strong for me, he would come for me. He would have called, just showed up at my door, send me and e-mail that we needed to talk. When a man really wants to be with you, I just feel like he's going to make that extra effort. If he has to make a fool out of himself, he'll do that. Derreck just doesn't feel that way about me. The man that feels that way about me hasn't made his presence known yet. You know, I used to say that I can't wait to be loved. Correction, I can't wait to love me...

Hmmm...uhh..since I once received a C in Biology by a merciful professor that overlooked the fact that I was a cheater, who am I to judge?  2.  Does the universe have an end?   Yup, and I think it's a coming soon...  3.  Are you superstitious? Explain.   Not really. Many a black cat has crossed my path and nothing ominous has happened. I recently opened up an umbrella inside and what do you know, I'm here to tell about it. So nah, not at all. But talk to me about astrology.....

When someone has their head on their shoulders, you know that they can see straightforward and keep their eyes on the mark. When it comes to looking at the future, you take a logical approach: what's within your ability? A fortunate attribute that you have is the ability to set a goal for yourself, higher than maybe you feel possible, but still keep yourself within reasonable bounds. You take the time to appreciate those surrounding you and they do appreciate you in return. Decision-making comes naturally to you when you take the time to consider each option. People only come to talk to you when they are looking for a logical, reasonable solution.  Aspirations: You have an idea of what you can do with your life, but you push it up a notch. You need a profession that you can enjoy, so work towards it. You want to live near your friends and family while being as far away as possible. You also want to settle down while working in excitement and variation.  Quirks: You don't appreciate drama queens and they don't appreciate you. When they need help, they won't seek you out because of your ability to see through their overly dramatic predicaments. You have leeway for humor, and sometimes love to participate in it, but when it becomes irrational behavior, others can count you out. Loud noises are bothersome, except when they come from you or your friends.  Factors: Reach for the sky! Don't decide to do something because you're merely good at it, but choose something you might like to do, despite whether you're sure you can master it or not. Don't only save room for a few empathetic friends, but open up to everyone.  Future: When looking for a job, if you work in all of your talents (logic, decision-making, planning, and definitely humor), you'll find yourself happy. Come to a compromise for location; live nearby your friends and take periodic vacations or live farther away and take frequent return trip

      Ya know, I been getting more into this whole blog thing...I have three that I read regularly now and it's making me even more stimulated to get my own shit together and dare I say..take it public. It's just that I have written some blah blah blah in here that I'm not sure I just want any Joe or Josephina to read. Or maybe it's not the Joe's or Josephina's I'm worried about. I guess maybe I need to take it semi public and make some online friends. Or is this just cheap therapy for me? Ionno...  Anywho, a lot had gone on since I last wrote. But like, it's all in my brain and I'm not sure how it will pour out on this "page." But here goes.  My eyes are green because I eat a lot of vegetables (and true Badu fans out there?) My coworker was talking about her impending marriage and her big ole townhouse and her big ole SUV that she is getting and her big ole profit off her condo and her big ole clean bill slate and her man that caters to her every whim and has a big ole...I'm taking it too far. But am I wrong to not really want to hear that shit. Like Vivica said in Two Can Play, you can't really truly be happy for the next bitch when your shit isn't correct...or something like that. It's not that I'm really even ready for all that. I enjoy hanging out at the bar getting drunk grooving to old school r&b with my gfs. Or downing a whole pitcher of magaritas with another gf and not have to worry about some pouting ass nigga wondering when I'm coming home. Can you enjoy your singleness and still want the security of a relationship? Ionno.  Okay, let's take it a step further. Then there's Koritha. Her ass was practically fucking random niggas bucked nekked and she gets to live rent free with what I'm assuming it a good ass niggra. Sigh. I kind feel like a class A biyotch for even saying this stuff. But heh, its my friggin blog. But uh...WHY?   Honestly, I go back and forth on whether I want a man right now anyway. I feel so jaded. I feel like I can't trust. I feel like I will be so suspecting of any suitor's motives that I will surely drive him away. I feel like why would he love me. Why wouldn't he? I'm a lot to put up with. Why should he? Why shouldn't he? Although my sex drive is pretty much at an all time low, I just today felt a tiny smidgon of really missing the touch and company of a man. Not so much the entrance of the schlong into my womb. But the conversation, the company...the excitement of knowing that it will happen. I miss dating. It's only been about 4 months, but I'm starting to feel it a bit.  On to this homebuying thing. I totally tripped on my new realtor, but she hung in there. I guess she really wants a sale. So I'm still in it for a minute.  I guess I'm enjoying my summer so far. I have a lot planned. I would like to go on a mini vacation. But honestly, I don't have the money...not until this homebuyig thing is settled. I can carely afford to do little things around here without scrimping for change at month's end. You know it's sad when you make like $10K more than some people but they always seem to have way more money than you. It's the American way. LOL!  Kay...gotta cut this short. Chappelle Show..Chappelle Show...

       1.If you were a genre of music, what would you be? Oh, and you can't cheat by saying a "blend of" or a "mix of" or anything of the like. You can only be one type so if you're truly more than one type, which one best fits you in general?   I am old school r&b...smooth, says profound things, may not be the "in thing" but still admired and still revered and often useful (sampling)   2. If you were a movie, what genre would you be? You can mix this one by the way.   Documentary...insightful, not the "in thing" but can teach you a lot if you jus lissen   3. If you were a color, what would you be and why?   Red because it's a showstopper (color of stop signs and red light) , fiery, signals danger ahead, sexy   4. If you were a piece of jewelry, what would you be?      A diamond...in the rough...with a few inclusions.     5. If you were the president of the United States, what would  you  do?   Take care of the problems HERE before worrying about what the fuck other countries are doing.   6. If you were having a wedding tomorrow, what would it be like?   On an island at sunset. Me in a simple straight white dress...him in all white, everyone in white. Us both barefoot (with the requisite pedicures of course!). Us saying vows we wrote to each other. Only about 10-15 people in attendance.   7. If you were given the chance to meet anyone, who would you meet in the film biz and the music biz?   You can pick 4 of each.   Film--Sanaa Lathan, Denzel, Al Pacino and Tom Hanks Music--Jilly from Philly, Anthony Hamilton, Lufer (I'll take big or little at this point), and the Whispers and/or The Gap Band (sorry I cheated--that's five) oh let me really cheat---Stevie Wonder   8. If you could go on a date with your dream man, what would you do on the date and what your dream man be like?   I don't know if there is sucha thing as a dream date. I figure something different would be to have a picnic in a park where they were also playing live music. Then it would be great to finish the evening with a nice stroll by a lakefront, just talking and enjoying each other's company. Right now, my dream man would be simply someone who is really interested in me and is willing to help me grow and accepts me for who I am...faults and all.  Someone who will LOVE me and in turn help me to love myself....because somedays I'm not sure that I do.   9. If you could be any age for the rest of your life, what age would you be and why?   My mid twenties have not been particularly happy. I've been having a good time socially, but overall they leave a lot to be desired. So I say 31 maybe because then I'm officially in my 30s...not 30.   10. If you were forced to be a doctor, what kind would you be and why?   A doctor of philosophy...in other words a Phd. A non-teaching Phd...more like a researcher and writer. No medical doctor. Nope...   11. If you were a painting, what would you look like?      Not a painting...but a black and white enlarged photo of me sitting alone on the beach, my head leaned back enjoying the wind of my face. The only color would be my hair and the polish on my toes, half hidden as they dig into the sand. Hmmm...I need to get someone to take that picture     12. If you had to choose between love or friendship, which would you choose?   I cant choose. You need both. I want to be my lover's best friend. And I love my best friends. It's all intertwined.   13. If you had to be a teacher, what would you teach and why?   I would teach a black literature class--20th century or  maybe a journalism course.   14. If you found out you were Princess Diana's daughter or son and Prince was your father, how would you deal with it?   WTF??? Prince as in The Artist Formally Knows As????   15. If you weren't you, who would you be?   I can't imagine being anyone but me. I could say someone else. But I figure God made me me for a reason. And God don't make no junk :-)

       1. In general, do you treat eating as a pleasure or a need?   Sigh...eating is too much of a pleasure for me and sadly, a strong need as well.   2. What is your opinion on recent low carb craze?   I have no opinion really. I know that low carb does work because I've lost weight on those type of diets before. But the "craze?" No opinion really.   3. Do you wake up when you have to, or do you stall / snooze for longer?   Much to my own detriment, I never wake up when I need to...always resulting in me being 10 minutes late to work.

      Well kiddies...  Since I've been MIA for a minute, I will just randomly go through various thoughts, feelings, occurences since we last spoke.  I just had a disturbing thought. Although I was completely sure I was over Derreck...why did I remember a convo where Lynn asked me if he asked me to marry him that day would I say yes? The answer was yes then...and I think it's still yes. WTF????? I need some new wang to totally and completely free my ass from that man. Free my ass...and my mind will follow!  Al called me last night. WTF???? Why don't I want to call him back? I have no desire to. I have been silently praying for male companionship. Placing ads on Cragislist (to no avail) and I'm not following up! WTF???  You know, living alone and spending loads of time alone like I do makes you really realize some shit about yourself. I am a really trife mofo. I am really trife and lazy about a LOT of things....housecleaning being a main thing. And I tried to buy a house. WTF???  I'm also still disturbed by the whole patio incident. Didn't write about that one. But long story short, I locked myself out on the patio and although people passed by, I didn't say anything. I was too...embarrassed or something. So I stayed out there all night. Finally in the morning, I timidly said something to the man downstairs and was rescued. But I stayed out there ALL night rather than be rescued. What's with this passive/agressiveness? WTF???  My weight...my eating...out of control. Me and Shaq might be about neck and neck. But I ain't 7 feet tall. I know what it is. The lonleliness is palpable (quiote from Carrie on Sex and the City). I eat in order not to feel the lonlieness. I eat so I won't feel. It's my company as I watch television.  That doctor was right. I don't really have much interaction with people once I come home. My phone barely rings. I have been really treating myself badly. Eating pasta and icecream and a bunch of other shady shit.  I need to stop myself before I pass the point of no return. I am about 40% sure that I will have the surgery before I turn 30. That may be too late. I may be well over 400 lbs by then. I think that's the point of no return. Once you get there, there is no way you're taking that off on your own.  Well on a happier note, I am going to start writing again. I went to a book fair last weekend and met this 25 y/o stunner (of no consequence, but just thought I'd throw that in) that was on her 2nd self-published book. WTF am I doing with my life!!!! That should be me. Living that dream. That's my passion. So I am going to take some fiction writing courses in the Fall. I think my market might be young adult readers---like 15-18. I want to catch them before they are reading that gangsta street shit. I want to write my Lexie-like stories, but with some real world shit. Like yes, they are gonna be fucking and cussing because that's what girls that age do. But with a moral in there. Like The Right Mistakes. We'll see.  Well as I said, I think...or thought I was ready to start dating again. In actuality, I think I'm scared of men. Scared of talking to an interacting with them. I think it's largely because of the abuse from the babysitter's son and Darren. Someone that made me scared of men. Wow---I've had that breakthrough before, but have never written it down.  I think maybe I should talk to a psychologist like I planned before. I got some shit going on in my head that I need to clear up. I need to figure out why I'm so lazzzzy...why I procrastinate....why I have all this ambition but sometimes find it hard to manifest it. Is that just me? Can that be helped? Or is that just me? And those are the same qualities that Derreck possessed. So I guess it's true. You are who you attract...  I am loving this blogging thing. Being able to peek into other people's world...other people's drama...I love it!  I just ordered these 2 CUTE shirts--1 for the Prince concert--says "Purple Rain" and one with "1908 on it". I am going to be a bad ass bitch! I may be "morbidly obese" but I'm still a fly ass bitch now! Chicks en-vee a sista. I be ragging!  I have been doing some good reading this summer. I think I've read about 7 books since the summer began and am still pushing on through. I've got a whole lot more to keep me busy. I call it research :-)  Okay, a bitch is really acting like she doesn't have to work tomorrow. I'll holla sooner than later. I think I am going to commit to writing at least 3 times a week. I gotta get my writing in somehow.  Until next time...ta ta!
