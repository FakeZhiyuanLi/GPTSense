       urlLink News from The Associated Press   Well, the hits just keep on coming.  I have a friend, much older than I.  This man is a hero in my eyes, but I can't talk about how he has fought for our contries.  His mother is 91 years old, and has a host of painful medical conditions. Her Social Security and Healthcare benefits won't cover her for the drug  urlLink Forteo , for her painful osteoporosis.  The cost is  urlLink astonishing .  It would be over $ 500 per month!!!! (Each Injection Pen lasts 28 days)  I managed to get his mom a supply for only $ 12.00 a month, direct from the drug company.  What the hell is the Bush administration playing at, taking money from the managed care vultures for their own use, and giving NOTHING to a war-hero's mother in the last months of her life?

       A Confession  Once in a while, I'm standing here, doing something. And I think, "What in the world am I doing here?" It's a big surprise.    —Donald Rumsfeld, May 16, 2001, interview with the New York Times     Clarity  I think what you'll find,  I think what you'll find is,  Whatever it is we do substantively,  There will be near-perfect clarity                 As to what it is.   And it will be known,  And it will be known to the Congress,  And it will be known to you,  Probably before we decide it,                 But it will be known.      —Donald Rumsfeld, Feb. 28, 2003, Department of Defense briefing

       Great, today we see an almost carbon-copy of the  urlLink Iraqi prisoner scandal  in the UK.  urlLink It's quite astounding , except poor old  urlLink Tony Blair , erstwhile Prime Minister of the UK, wants the investigation to continue, but there are some questions about if these pictures are real.   Some military types have said that the webbing wrapped round the boots of the soldiers, is not regulation issue.  That the gun's seen were 'too clean'.  Whatever.     Here is the scoop.  These untrained MP's, are just doing what they are told.    Let me explain, the 'civilian contractors' are all sacred cows.  It takes a good 10 years to train an interrogator / analyst / translator for this type of thing. We fired them all in the late 80's and very early 90's.     Now, thanks to these corporate entities, they have been resurrected. Not for the Flag or for Queen and Country, but only for a paycheck.    The MP's have no idea what to do, yet it seems the most experienced and qualified (ex-intel)civilian' contractors can't direct or control the interrogation?&nbsp; How does that work?   The implications of these events are massive.&nbsp; We really (UK &amp; USA) will now have dreadful problems diplomatically, particularly with those states who have been controlled in their development by sanctions for 'human rights abuses', trumpeted by the policy-mongers of our respective Governments.    I watched the senate hearing with Defense Secretary  urlLink Donald  Rumsfeld  and just saw a map with no idea what to do.&nbsp; He continued to say he would resign if 'I thought for one moment that I was no-longer effective...&quot;.&nbsp; Well, Rummybaby, I think most of us are far more concerned about your COMPETENCE, not your EFFECT.' NONE of the soldiers, contractors, MP's, Marines, Intel Slime or assorted Lords-a-Leaping or Swans-A-Swimming should have been allowed CAMERAS!!!! in an interrogation. But then we have seen how lax the Bush administration is with security and intelligence, they even NAMED one of their own, and risked her and every contact she had, in her job as an undercover CIA agent, working in WMD related areas.   Resign, Rumsfeld - you are a fish out of water.&nbsp; You clearly do NOT know what's best, and made great issue about how tough you are in arguing the people who do know, down.&nbsp; What a great tough man you are, with nothing to offer World Politics, War's or indeed the American People.&nbsp; You've had your 15 minutes of fame, again. Perhaps the new incarnation of Tricky Dickie (Cheney) will have to survive with only 3 or 4 agents in the Whitehouse?

       urlLink Michael Moore.com : Mike's Message : Mike's Latest News   Mr Bush has placed a huge bet that Americans will back him as a "war president" able to defend the nation against Islamic fundamentalism. Yet the chaos in Iraq and mounting US casualties have steadily eroded popular support for the president, while the absence of weapons of mass destruction has undermined the original premise for war.  New polls suggest that many Americans believe the Iraq war has increased rather than decreased the threat from terrorism - the message of Fahrenheit 9/11. Moreover, the film's argument that Iraq was a war of choice rather than necessity is increasingly accepted, not only among liberal activists, but also by the foreign policy establishment.
