      Or so seems to be the opinion of the Catholic Church. An 8-year old girl has had her communion  urlLink declared invalid  because there was no wheat in the wafer. She happens to be allergic to wheat, so she used a rice wafer, and they called her on it. What the hell is wrong with these people? I thought Catholicism was supposed to be about love and charity and burning the occasional heretic. So now they send it all the way up to the Vatican level to decide. Sounds like bureaucracy to me. I have issues with the Catholics to begin with, but this stuff is just absurd. They're holding out communion like a goddamn carrot on a stick.  -"But I want it!" -"Can't have it." -"But I want it!" -"And you're in AA and you still have to drink the wine." -"But...what the hell?" -"And, you voted for a candidate who supports gay marriage. HA! DENIED!" -etc  So, the overall picture we're gettin here is of a backwards, intolerant, (perverted, no less) bunch of old men who are twisting the idea of faith into knots for whatever reasons they want, And a billion people put up with this shit! If somebody hadn't got up and said somethin about it, they'd still be excommunicatin people right and left and burnin them at the stake. Now, I don't have a problem with the Catholics themselves, for the most part, any more than I have a problem with, say, Muslims or Jews. (Believe me, certain segments of all of the above are definitely getting on my nerves lately). But the leadership sucks. Ok, so that's the theological rant. Sometimes I think someone should resurrect Manicheanism, it makes about as much sense as any modern religion. As the good  urlLink Edward Abbey  said, "Orthodoxy is a relaxation of the mind accompanied by a stiffening of the heart."  In other news,  urlLink Bill Maher is playing the role of Satan.  Go Bill!  I assume there are few people out there who believe that this is true calling anyway.

      Ok, so I was recently referred to  urlLink George Will  as a good source for the conservative perspective.  So this morning, I brace myself, open the opinion page, and see "Iraq Illustrates Perils of Empire" by GW himself.  Say what?  Empire?  This looks interesting.  (I later find that the original title was the less, ah, biased "Ignoring History in Iraq".)   Anyway, I started reading it, and immediately encounter comparisons to early U.S. empire-building.  Annexation of the Phillipines?  Mexican-American war?  What?  Is this George Will or Howard Zinn?  At the end we even get a nod to that taboo analogy, VIETNAM!  What is a conservative in his right mind doing comparing Iraq to Vietnam?  That's our job!  And he says the other GW could lose the election over it!   Ok so that was kinda strange.  That's all.  Any idea why the date and time system on this Blogger is so godawful?  I have to correct it by hours every time, and it's off by some completely random and constantly differing amount.  Arg.

      George W was here. Today, right here in Traverse City. Being the first time a sitting president has deigned to visit our little corner of the country since Gerald Ford in '75, it was a big deal. Turnout somewhere around 10-12,000. I was unfortunately unable to attend, due to the event selling out several days in advance, but I caught some of it on the local news.  urlLink News  and  urlLink transcript . Bush emphasized the economy, and amazingly enough, he delivered  today , at least for us. That's right, George W Bush has helped my family! Not through tax cuts, but because my dad was paid overtime for clearing the streets and making sure the protesters didn't get out of hand. Dubyah also noted the effectiveness of his prescription drug plan (the one whose cost he wouldn't tell us?). On marriage, he reaffirmed his position that "We ought to be encouraging marriage in America." Really George? No shit. Maybe you should talk to some activist judges from Massachussetts about that. More on health care, "We'll expand research to seek new cures for terrible diseases." Sure. As long as they don't involve stem cells. Bad stem cells!  And "You can't be pro-doctor and pro-patient and pro-plaintiff attorney at the same time. You have to choose. My opponent made his choice, and he put him on the ticket. " Kudos, Mr. President. Remarkably witty. On the economic difficulties, "We've overcome these obstacles because of the hard work of America's entrepreneurs and farmers and ranchers and small business owners and workers...We want our farmers not only feeding Americans, but we want them feeding hungry mouths all across the globe. Farm income is up, and one of the reasons it's up, is because of exports of agricultural products are on the rise, and I intend to keep it that way." Maybe farm income is up because you paid them 80 billion dollars in subisidies! But nevermind that. Overall, we gotta give him some credit. He got the crowd going, he said dignity instead of dignitude, and finally got that line about loving our neighbors as we'd like to love ourselves right. Bush also gave us a new weird phrase, "rallying the armies of compassion". Yeah, you do that then.  So I guess that about covers that. Found this  urlLink poem  recently though, quite creative.

      Welcome to The Spin Zone. On this blog, I will  disseminate liberal propaganda  post on topics concerning politics and current events. If by chance you should disagree with my take on these subjects you are welcome to  shove it  discuss them. I'd like to create a  one-party socialist state  atmosphere conducive to open debate and, as you might have guessed, try not to take things too seriously. That said, I'd like to thank  urlLink Johnny Walker Red  for inspiring this blog, though hopefully my readers won't take him to seriously either :)
