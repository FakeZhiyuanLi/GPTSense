      i haven't wrote in long bit. so much stuff have happened. good then now bad. i duno what he wantz. or what i want. it waz so hard for me to say i dind't want to see him today. in my heart i knew i waz lying. buh what can i do? i told him the reason. and all he said waz "i think i want to be left alone sleeping on my bed" those exact same words made meeh feel like this now. like damn  shit . i don't knoe what to do .. or say. why is this happening so fast? i miss him so much. does he knoe? everytime i say i hate him, i dont mean it. why? how?  cuz eventually if you say "i love you" too much, it looses its meaning. so saying that, just simply cross it out. does he knoe? no he doens't. he doesn't understand. yet, he'z so perfect and.. everything i wanted. maybe all except this lil bit. i still and will still do love him. whatever he'z doing and how far he goes. mentally im alwayz with him. i can still sometimes smell him in my room. cuz im missing him so much.

      i waz mad at him yesterday. but i dind't tell him why. why? cuz i thought there waz no use of telling him. since it'z going to fade away anywayz. but just to get it out my chest. i waz mad, cuz yesterday he was supose to pick meeh up from my house at 3:40. i thought to myself it would be such a good day to spend all my time with him since joyce had work. then , i talked to him online during last period. i regret going on the comp. buh at the same time i waz glad cuz i would be even more mad if he told meeh straight up. anywayz. so he told meeh he was going to be late a lil. somply cuz he  had  to drive his friend for job interview and also karine to some place. i waz thinking to myself. what a fucken lyer. he said i was the most important person and i am the first priority. my damn asss. no offence buh he cared for his friends more than meeh. so i was pissed all over. maybe you can call this, "jealousy" buh i duno. anyhooo. so i went over to my mum'z place and went shopping with her for a bit. he called meeh around 5:30-ish sayen he'z going to pmall now. if i actully waited for him at home till 5:30, i would've died. so i waz still pissed, so i kinda ignored him for a whole and just shop with my mom. sooo i made him wait for meeh for lke an hr or so, and i finaly reached pmall. part of the reason why i waz late, cuz there was traffic. buh also cuz i wanted him to wait for a bit.   ahhhh, i duno mann. im such a bitch. during that time at pmall then, all i did was sit there and listen to him and angus talk. talk talk and talk. edgar came in.. and i sat somewhere else. he come sitting beside meeh and blablabla. right when i came bac into the room, it seemed as if he was a whole different person. he wouldn't hold my hands. he wouldn't talk to me. and he would even look at meeh. i was soo about to burst buh i walked out the room and went outside for a smoke. he comes after finding meeh. walked a bit. then somehow, we just became just strangers and walked separately. we stood in this ally way where noone reallie walkz to. i stood with my bac facing him. then i looked at him. he looks away. i stood somewhere else and i began to cry. all these people were looken at meeh, buh i didn't care. everyone else sees meeh but him. all he did was look in another different direction and ignor me. i stand facing him after. he still wouldn't look at mee. i stared at him for a long while. he finally sees meeh. he just started to glare for while and i looked away while my tears were just droping to the floor. he came up to me  finally  and started to ask meeh why am i crying. im such a sor ju. i still wouldn'te tell him why i waz mad, buh instead i said, "nothen waz wrong, i waz just being dumb"  reason: why i dind't tell him.  i knoe that he had shitload of other crap to think about. i dind't wanna bother him with mine. even tho he asked for it, i still wouldn't tell him. he'z going to be leaving soon. i dont want him to have shitload of crap bothering him when he goes. he'll be thinking how to deal with it. and what to do and stuff. so.. i didn't even bother.   okayy. im done bSing noww. stop reading =D

      tears of pain. can't help but rushing down my face.  as i sit here, infront of my computer.  thinking about the one i love so dearlly, clement tsang. will i get a chance to tell him how i reallie feel? how much and how deep i have fallin in love with him. never thought a guy can change my life until now. until that very day i met him. he's my everything. i would do anything in the world to see him smile. but what can i do now? nothing. sit, wait.. i love him too much to let him go.
