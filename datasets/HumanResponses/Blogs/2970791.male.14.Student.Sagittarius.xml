							 I would just like to say that in a 'CIMMIE,' someone hacked into my computer and wrote that.  Who ever said I like TF is sooooooo going to accidentally run into my knife that im holding 10 times.  In other words you are going to die, but im going to make it look like you killed yourself.  Got it?  Ok now that weve got that settled.  I would like to make a public apology and say that yes, Orly is the coolest.  He is not wird, but overly good looking.  I would also like to say, that Hermione is hotttt and is going to marry orly after, she turns down tf and rupie.  Just to let u know.   I would like to also make an addition to the 40 best people of 2004 list.  Number 3 is the African American woman that works at the Hagendaz in th King of Prussia Mall.  Only because she has such great skill in throwing a milkshake across the room and saying WTF!/ not 'wheres Tom/Meg Felton.'   Shes my hero.

								The phrase that's said when you see the coolest person alive (other than cimmie) 
								 M an, I wish i was on his buddylist, 
								 
								that's the same person that is  F ashionably coordinated, 
								 E ducated and intelligent, 
								 L ovable, ravishing and likable, 
								 T remendously orgasmic 
								 O utrageously poplar and adored as much as David Beckham in  
								E N gland, which is simply not big enough to inhabit the amount of fame associated with Tom Felton. And that's why he has a dual citizenship with the USA!

							 "The young captain [Pieter] of Gondor [Grellow] has but to extend his hand to take the ring for his own and the world will fall. He is close now, so close to achieving his goal. For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth, even until the ending of the world. The time of the elves is over. Do we leave Middle Earth [Grellow] to this fate? Do we let them stand alone?"  "The fellowship is breaking"  But only because of the ignorant people in this blog.  They all say that people like...im going to try not to gag, but ORLI and HERMOINE are attractive... LIARS!!  I am writing this because I have felt that I have lost my fellow bloggers to the evil that lurks in their names.  I have heard rumors that are just plain rubbish (meg-- things involving her)  So...I am formally withdrawing from this blog.  I feel as though I cannot connect with any of the people in here besides RupieLover.  I don't understand how anyone could dislike Tom Felton.  He speaks with such depth and life..unlike Hermoine who is scytzophrenic... 
								Tom Felton quote:  
								“I have been learning off-road with my brother. The BMW is what I want — until a Lamborghini is in my price range.  
								 
								“The BMW will be my ‘well done, Tom, for all your hard work’ pressie. Chris has one, he got me into them.”  
								HOW CAN ANYONE NOT AGREE WITH THAT?!?!   
								Orlando quote: "Life is a highway...you just have to look out for the little signs." WTF?!?!?!?!  I wonder what homeless person told him that one.   
								Unless I get written apologies from Pieter-Wanna-Mac and that Utada fan...I will not be visiting Grellow anymore... 
								I will be very missed...

									 Cimmie, I completely agree with you, the dinosaurs became extinct because they 
									 
										 because the dinosaurs didn't want to take up the precious space required for tom felton's stardom. JK Rowling put all the 
									 
									 attractive people 
									 
										 to be bad-good guys like TF,
									 
									 she 
									 
										 put the ugly people in the "good people" catergory to make you side with the much superior slytheryn  and used the only 
										 
											attractive
										 
										 one,
										 
											 TF
										 
										 in all of england to represent good as she represented 
										 
											good
										 
										 with über-ugly people-TF. I 
										 
											HATE
										 
										 Harmone she turns me 
										 
											OFF
										 
										like an flame on a stove (See Image).  Oh, 
										 
											and I never
										 
										 dream about that pretty frizzy haired girl. Well any  way, 
										 
											TF's cool and she's a fool
										 
										. Beware because flames can burn. Whenever you're sad, think of 
										 
											TF
										 
										 and your face will light right up!  
										 
										(P.S. I realize I spelled her name wrong.)

										 "On Friday [May, 14,] Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow gave birth to a baby girl named Apple Blythe Alison Martin (9 pounds, 11 ounces). The baby's father is Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin who, like myself, was born in Exeter. All four members of Coldplay own Apple PowerBooks and iPods, and they used Pro Tools and Power Macs to create both of their hit albums. Coincidence?" a website said about the name of the baby.  
										 (referring to the  urlLink Mac OS )  
										 
										 urlLink BBC  wrote that the famous parents said shortly after the birth of Apple Blythe Alison Martin "We are 900 miles over the moon, and we'd like to thank everyone at the hospital who have looked after us amazingly." Why the fcuk would the Coldfield member say that??? Clearly he was stoned at the time. (Name, and saying bizarre things about the moon). Oh and the baby was born after an hour long labor after our Greek and  Roman  games, due to the 9 lb fatness of the baby.  
										 
										A spokesman for the couple confirmed everything had gone to plan. [That's because everything was planned, meaning the stammers planned to name the girl after the infamous fruit for weeks prior to the birth. This story keeps on getting stranger, It must be a British thing. We all know how weird those British are!

							 Tom Felton is the reason why everything wrong has is or will ever happen in this world. Why did the dinosaurs become extinct? Because the had a premonition of what Tom Felton would look like. Why did the cold war start? Both Russia and the United States believed Tom Felton would be born in the other country. He is the product of God wanting to punish us, and by us I mean the entire global population. He is fugly, heinous, grotesque, craptacular, pukalicious, heinous and just plain UNNATTRACTIVE!   The only defense we have against him is Orlando Bloom, and the only reason it's not working is because YOU GUYS ARE HELPING TOM FELTON!

							 I would just like to say that in a 'CIMMIE,' someone hacked into my computer and wrote that.  Who ever said I like TF is sooooooo going to accidentally run into my knife that im holding 10 times.  In other words you are going to die, but im going to make it look like you killed yourself.  Got it?  Ok now that weve got that settled.  I would like to make a public apology and say that yes, Orly is the coolest.  He is not wird, but overly good looking.  I would also like to say, that Hermione is hotttt and is going to marry orly after, she turns down tf and rupie.  Just to let u know.   I would like to also make an addition to the 40 best people of 2004 list.  Number 3 is the African American woman that works at the Hagendaz in th King of Prussia Mall.  Only because she has such great skill in throwing a milkshake across the room and saying WTF!/ not 'wheres Tom/Meg Felton.'   Shes my hero.

										 "On Friday [May, 14,] Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow gave birth to a baby girl named Apple Blythe Alison Martin (9 pounds, 11 ounces). The baby's father is Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin who, like myself, was born in Exeter. All four members of Coldplay own Apple PowerBooks and iPods, and they used Pro Tools and Power Macs to create both of their hit albums. Coincidence?" a website said about the name of the baby.

										 urlLink BBC  wrote that the famous parents said shortly after the birth of Apple Blythe Alison Martin "We are 900 miles over the moon, and we'd like to thank everyone at the hospital who have looked after us amazingly." Why the fcuk would the Coldfield member say that??? Clearly he was stoned at the time. (Name, and saying bizarre things about the moon). Oh and the baby was born after an hour long labor after our Greek and  Roman  games, due to the 9 lb fatness of the baby.  
										 
										A spokesman for the couple confirmed everything had gone to plan. [That's because everything was planned, meaning the stammers planned to name the girl after the infamous fruit for weeks prior to the birth.

							 Tom Felton is the reason why everything wrong has is or will ever happen in this world. Why did the dinosaurs become extinct? Because the had a premonition of what Tom Felton would look like. Why did the cold war start? Both Russia and the United States believed Tom Felton would be born in the other country. He is the product of God wanting to punish us, and by us I mean the entire global population. He is fugly, heinous, grotesque, craptacular, pukalicious, heinous and just plain UNNATTRACTIVE!   The only defense we have against him is Orlando Bloom, and the only reason it's not working is because YOU GUYS ARE HELPING TOM FELTON!

       This is Dougie speaking on Sporko's behalf, since she is in New Orleans and must pay for an Internet connection with money out of her own pocket. Getting to the point, Sporko wants people to bring their yearbooks with them to school so that she might have a chance to sign them. I'm bringing mine, you should too.

       Unfortunatly, it is unlikely that a "cross-dressing day" will happen. The only day it is possible is Tuesday. Monday and Thursday we have off, Wednesday, is the awards ceremony for the atletic awards and honors, (Mrs. Braxton will be taking pictures) and obviously due to commencement we will be unable switch on Friday. (That is of course unless Katie is willing to give up her Versace dress or Cimmie plans on losing a hundred pounds so she can fit in a guy's outfit). Nevertheless, we have to do this switch on Tuesday, if at all. This wont work if someone forgets or backs out thinking "Oh my God, if I cross-dress I won't graduate, because they'll expell me!" We need to coordinate plans since our only choice of a day is the next day we have school. We need to figure out something soon. My Idea is the following: In this 'chatterbox,' write your name if you are   willing  to participate. Maybe we'll do it if more than half the class is willing. After that, I'll make arrangements with people asking if they can let someone borrow their skirt or pants. I will also support requests so Emily can get in Kyle's pants. Below is the chatterbox and I hope this can happen with your support.   Write your First name, and whether or not you are willing to participate.      var chatterbox = 'no';         urlLink target="flooblechatterbox"  onClick="window.open('about:blank','flooblechatterbox','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,copyhistory=no,width=480,height=400');return true;">  align="absbottom">Talk   in my  urlLink flooble chatterbox, a free javascript chat tag board / shoutbox / tagboard program for your xanga, diary, blogger or weblog  |   urlLink logic puzzles, brainteasers      if (!chatterbox || chatterbox != 'ok') {  document.write('This  urlLink flooble chatterbox  is'); document.write(' temporarily unavailable. It will be back up shortly.'); }

       for some odd reason my mother (yes, my mother) felt the need to discuss the cross-dressing day with me and she thinks it would be funny, but says we should do it (if we do it at all) on Tuesday because wednesday is the moving up ceremony and the acedemic awards thingy so people will be in full "dress code mode" and they might not approve...

       We should totally do a cross dressing day. While I fully understand about the whole uncomfortable to wear a skirt and problem with getting the right sizes things, we should still do it becuase it would be really funny and no one's ever done it before.

       ok so here's my thought: since we have the awards ceremony on wednesday, june 2nd, it would be wise to be dressed in regular uniform for that event. We, however, could switch dress codes on tuesday. That was a good idea tori, with going to the trift store, because it would also be problematic if we didn't get our uniforms back in time for the awards ceremony on wednesday (I don't know about the rest of you, but i only own one kilt that fits me). If anyone likes this idea, please say so in your next blog

       From now on, you  have to  include titles.  This is because otherwise, it seems like you named your post something else.  For instance,  A Wrinkle in Time  by Madeleine L'Engle would be called  It was a dark and stormy....   Doesn't work.  That includes you too, Emily Combe.

       I really want to see  urlLink The Day After Tommorrow  today. It came out 13 hours ago and I was thinking maybe for a cool reward to the end of exams, we could go see it tonight in Frazer. This is not finalized and I don't want only like one person showing up so I have included a poll stating if we should go. I will decide whether or not the movie is on based on the popularity of the category "yes we should do it." If it is less than half, than the trip is off (and visa versa). I hope we can do it tonight at 7:00.    urlLink The Day After Tomorrow (PG-13, 124 min.)| 7:00pm |     THE MOVIE IS OFF, NO ONE WILL BE ATTENDING TONIGHT'S MOVIE

       This blog is being posted due to the fact that little development has happened recently regarding the last day of school uniform swap. If we all plan to switch uniforms with a certain individual, we must somehow organize something soon. Also what do we consider the last day of school? I think if  everyone  participates, this will be a success. We must plan this soon and pray that there is not a drop-the-dress-code-day on the last day of school.

       You are indeed right, Sporko. I do have lots of friends. Lots of very good friends without whom I am uncertain as to what my fate would have been. And believe me, I love you all too.  In other news, Tucker created this awesome piece of work, possibly using declassified CIA technology:       It's going to be the cover for Ted's album when it is released. That should be happening fairly soon, with any luck at all. Oh, and you can click right  urlLink here  if you want to see a real photo of Ted.

       I know you're gonna hate this Dougie, but i have to post this. This is  one of Dougies away messenges... "I have nobody. My dad, the last person left in my life who believed in me, just got turned against me by my mom. My sister hates my guts and my mom and my dad think I'm a slacker. My grades have dropped in school and I'm going to end the year by disgracing myself. I'm probably going to do badly on my finals. The ex-marine who used to live here is breaking into our studio to use it and he's messing with our dogs. Add in the whole unrequited love and teenage angst, and my life is 100%, unfiltered, premium, grade A shit" I think this means that we have a friend in need, if everyone is willing to donate something that would cheer our heart-broken friend up, post it, donate to the "boost-dougies-self-esteem-fund". Thank You

       Hi, you know you love  urlLink Apple , but only 1% of computer users use it. Most of the 98% of  urlLink Windows  users say that they don't use  urlLink Macs  because of compatibility (where only few of their beloved Windows programs are not usable on Macs.) I don't think that was among the things that bothered  urlLink this man  but he was definitely bothered. Don't get me wrong that I dislike Apple Computers (because I am about to switch, as I like them more than windows machines), but this is one of the funniest videos I have ever seen. This man speaks of his experience on the Mac very badly, but it is funny because although he "dislikes Macs" he still uses them and even edited the video on a Mac.  urlLink Check it out here  , and   enjoy .

       ::clap::, at least someone is on my side, I have nothing against Emily (well for this argument at least) but I just don't see what's she's adding to this blog, she just screws everything up, breaks all the rules and then does a stupid lie apology and does it again. It's really not cool.

       i take it i have been banned from speaking in hacker, sayign i doubt anyof you can read hacker fluently (knowing a few words is NOT considered fluent.) blah, where did quiggy go anyway, i miss him. and emily the poll that tuck put up was "mabye later if she breaks more rules" and "yes" i personaly voted yes, you have broken enough rules as it is. 60% says "mabye later" its later we shoudl kick you out, youve broken enough rules. 40% thought we should have kicked you out a while ago. quiggy, we need your expert advice on this matter (or your password so i can kick her out.) for now, this is sporko reporting from SBC (sporko brodcasting company)

       It's fine. I know, Quiggy did break his own rule, but that was 'cause he had sort of... well, he freaked out, frankly. And we can use mild curse words, if you really want to. And, of course, you can curse as much as you want as long as it's in a different language. For instance, I frequently say bugger (although, that's just British slang, not a different language). And I am certainly going to miss you too. And you. And you. Heck, I'll miss all of you.  In other news, I figured out what was messing the blog up and I fixed it, so everything's back to normal, although you might want to check out the sidebar for the updated rules. I did some tweaking.

       thanks dougie----again, I'm sorry taco and quiggy and dougie. I do not understand why we cannot use curse words, seeing that quiggy broke his OWN rule by using the word--and i quote "fucking" in one of his posts-----again I am sorry, and i just wana keep this blog going as long as possible, I'm going to miss all you guys soo much next year!

       Do you think maybe we could keep the fightin' and the feudin' to a minimum?  To Tucker: Scroll down. Emily apologized, she had not read your post. I, at least, am not going to kick her out. Also, as you are not an admin you don't set the rules, although I would prefer mild swear words (or badly misspelled ones ::cough  urlLink danmmed  cough::) to a constant stream of not-so-mild ones. One other thing is, we don't all always spell everything right. I know I don't.  To Emily: Tucker is right in that a proper respect for the rules should be maintained. However, as you did apologize, I don't see any real problem.  To Quiggy: Where the heck are you, Quiggy!? This blog is succumbing to chaos! There is looting and pillaging in the streets! Somebody, light the Quig-signal!  We need you Quiggy!

Well, you just used your last chance, someone please kick Emily out!!! I'm not trying to be mean but shes breaking every rule and grr....I'm done.

Well, this was fun lets do it again sometime. Whoever centered the whole blog (quiggy...) should be brutally beaten my me it looks weird, at least I think it does. P.S.

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meg, everyone loves him/her but nobody knows her real sexual identity. That was all to change when we did a drive by of Sonoco's A-plus. Cimmie handed the slip asking whether she/he preferred Coke or Pepsi which Taylor had recently typed up, and...after much speculation over the whole "it's for a school newspaper" alabi, Meg filled out the form. The first field was her name which we told him/her was unnecessary to fill out so she left it blank. Right below that field, however was the most important field...the gender question. It asked wheter or not Meg was a girl or if she was a boy. Taylor waited until we left A-plus to read it. And it read FEMALE. I was shocked Meg is/was/will be a female. I was convinced she was a he, but I am starting to face reality and I can't wait to see Meg over the summer when I visit A-plus.  Oh and P.S. Emily, USE TITLES!

       Have you ever had a craving to make your own song? Get a laugh? Eat some Chinese food? No? Well you need to go to this website to get some inspiration and a laugh, but I don't think they offer Chinese food. I am not going to ruin any surprises but it sounds pretty cool if you type in the only large field in the website (I wont say what it's labeled)"I found this place not to long ago, This is too much fun. I know what I will do tonight." Don't ask someone told me to do it and it the result is surprisingly good. You wont regret clicking on  urlLink this link . Enjoy!

Because of that outburst I have decided to kill you....with hugs and caring.  Thanks for your time, Taco

       Doug and I will probably be heading the Brain-Eating contest starting tomorrow night.  If you're interested, please comment on this post, stating which side you want (USB or CSB), and who you want for your captain.  Tomorrow night is the deadline.

       I have a new idea, quite possibly the best one yet.  We should split into two teams, the United States of Blog and the Confederate States of Blog.  Each team gets their own blog.  Each team also gets their own Brain-Eating account.  For one week, each team tries to eat more brains than the other team.  You may affect B of D, however the changes must be fixable.  Doug and I would be on seperate teams, and would not make any new administrators or delete old ones.  Vote in the new poll to vote on whether or not this is cool.

       ...if you're desperately bored or have an addiction to voting in polls. In case the previous sentence didn't tip you off, the Blog of the Danmmed is proud to bring you another poll! The results of the previous poll indicated that Quiggy and I are evil mutant lobster chickens, which would explain why typing is so difficult. Thank goodness for mail-order helper monkeys!

       Well, seeing as how the reaction seems to be a resounding thumbs down, I will remove the post, but I still think that the song is hilarious.  I sincerely apoligize to anyone who was offended.  If the admins care to warn me, so be it.  Once again, I'm sorry.

       That was the greatest concert I've ever been to...ever! Ok, Peter Frampton was amazing on the guitar. For those of you who love the guitar I suggest you listen to one of his songs. But, STYX IS THE GREATEST BAND!!!!!!! I know most of you expected Styx to be old and crippled by now, but it has been more than 4 decades ago since Styx started (so they must be in thier late 40's, early 50's, or late 50's) but they were dancing around up there jumping over the equipment, doing highkicks, and seemed they were in their 30's! Their voices even sounded exactly the same from the early years! The person who played the keyboard (and did a lot of the lead singing) is officially my new hero. He's also really amusing. Randomly in the middle of the concert he turned to the rest of Styx and said, "Well, we know you can rock, but can you...rag-time?" And he started playing rag-time on the keyboard and everyone on stage started square dancing. And all of Styx was steaming hot, with their tight, tight, tight, tight pants, esp. the keyboardist who had the tighest pants of all, and...well, I'll just stop there, for all of your sakes...STYX ROCKS!!!!!!!!!

       Quiggy is not being oppressive; he is discriminating accordingly. So far in its virtual existence, The Blog of the Danmmed has existed as a haven for Montgomery students, now ex-Montgomery students of course, and he is merely sticking by the principles on which this blog was founded. While in the future there may be exceptions to this, you have not made an overly convincing case for yourself. I hope that future animosity between the denizens of the BotD and yourself may be avoided, and I do apologize if the current configuration of the BotD has caused you any distress. However, we are currently unable to fulfill your wish to join, and as your present actions contradict any perceived desire you might have to join, we do not see a possibility of a wish of that nature being fulfilled in the foreseeable future. Once again, I apologize for the inconvenience.

        I have been pretty bored this summer. I have watched tv and played video games and sometimes gone to the pool. Now that the public schools are out I will actually have someting fun to do.

       The new rule is disbanded.

<date>20,June,2004</date>
<post>

    
       First of all, I know who wrote the stuff on the Chatterbox.  It was Evan's brother, Matt.  Evan and Matt are down in NC with me and that is my IP address.  He used Evan's laptop.  Because I revealed the evil (not to say hilarious) prankster, we should not have the chatterbox post/blog post rule.  If that rule stays in effect, I will have to flood the blog again, and remember how irritating that got?  I wil also flood the chatterbox just to get rid of the great prank messages. 
    
    
</post>

<date>20,June,2004</date>
<post>

    
        Just so everyone knows, I am temporarily enforcing a new rule: if you post,  you must also enter a message into the chatterbox   This is twofold: it will help remove the offensive messages, and it will help me catch the doer of these evil doings.   SHOULD YOU NOT LEAVE A MESSAGE, I MAY ASSUME THAT IT IS YOU!!!   
    
    
</post>

<date>20,June,2004</date>
<post>

    
       Attention everybody:  this is a public service announcement.  The chatterbox is completely rude and offensive.  Unless the person responsible comes forward, they will be kicked out when they are discovered.  Should they come forward, they will only recieve one warning.  Thank you.

If you don't know what it is, it's the nerdiest pencil and paper game on the face of the Earth, but it's fun.  I was thinking that a grout of people would get together at my house every friday or something and mess around and play and whatnot.  It's mainly to stay in touch, and if you want to play, just post something.  Happy nerdiness!

Emily's or Tori's???  Well the one thing I know is that it won't be at my house on account of the fact that if anybody wanted to swim... it would be in my bathtub.  Well best of luck to whoever figures this out.  I will come though... where ever and whenever it may be.  So that is all for now. Cheerio,  Kelsey

       Here's an idea for that pool party: if we were to have a pool party at night, it would probably be best to have a sleep-over because I have a feeling that my parents, at least, would be somewhat less than willing to pick me up at someone's house at whatever it may be, 2 AM or whatever. So, as I said, if it were a sleep-over it could go as late as we wanted without any worries.  Just an idea.

       Calling all members of TED, your mission, if you chose to accept it is to get Dougie to get everyone together to record again, soon!! So Dougie, invite them and they will come. I just got a ton of crazy like hard-core garage rock stuff and a hard-core garage rock pedal so I need to record and it's gonna sound so cool with like the wailing clarinet in the backround and then erics have to do a solo with my pedal!! It's gonna be amazing.

       I have a really cool idea.  Sometime this summer we should throw a pool party...at night.  My pool has lights (that change colors:)) so it would be safe, but it's have to be really late.  Anyways, tell me what you think because as I said before, I think it's a fairly cool thought.((tor))

       Sorry again about that, but i've been shut in my room for that past three days, am living on water, and am about to completely spaz.  So, humor me and take this poll. I finally remembered about my appointment at the eye doctor to get some colored contacts because they are cool.  Now I don't know which color I should get first. Please vote as I shall do as you bid.

       It's the future of concerts!! I was at the Blink 182/ No Doubt concert, which was seroiuly rockin' and they had this thingy, were they played like a slower song and they were like "before many of u were born, in the late 90's, during a slow song poeple held up lighters, but now it's the techonloy age and everything so in recongion of this ever hold up you're cell phones instead". Cool idea right, well its was awesome, one of the coolest thing's I've ever seen. Just had to share that moment, and i got a cool pic but it was too dark and didnt come out right.

       20 things I have learned Through My eighth Grade Experience: 1. Before you insult someone, make sure they are not standing behind you. You will save yourself much explaining and stuttering and awkwardness this way 2. TRY to remember where you left your bag - they have a tendency to move around 3. learn how to open your locker rather than having someone else do it all year long 4. Never volunteer if you don't know what you will be doing 5. Be creative with your excuses 6. continuation of #5: become emotional 7. DON'T GIVE PEOPLE YOUR PENS (YOU WILL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN) 8. Visible bra straps are a no-no 9. The same goes for clear dresses 10. Don't be downwright mean to anyone without proper contemplation - you might need them to do something for you later 11. When in doubt, employ the phrase "I didn't do it!" 12. be inconspicuous when chewing illegal gum 13. Always get out of running laps - again, be creative and remember, it's all in the timing... 14. Make friends with the lunch people 15. Wear the specified socks  16. EVERYTHING has a loophole - it's your job to find them 17. listen to everyones advice and then promptly disregard it (haha ms. V and the box projects) 18. remember that you will be seeing these people almost every day for the next year - be nice to them 19. inside jokes will not seem funny when you tell them to others - hence the name inside jokes. And...last but not least... 20. Stand out  I hope you all feel very knowledgable now. --feel free to post your own knowledge you acquired this year

       Sorry, that was my stomache.  Begging for more water.  I've been living on water lately.  Oh well, at least I have no chance of getting dehydrated.   Anyways... people who have control over these things (sadly not me): FIX THE LINK TO MY BLOG!   PLEASE! it just takes you to a page that says error or something.  I think it's because I deleted my other blog and started another one, but it's under the same username so it should work...i hope thank you for your time

       Ok, today we have my favorite music list, stolen straight from the blog of Gabo. (not in order)     THE WHITE STRIPES!! ::  (::insert loud cheering here::) um...well everything, there are only about 2 or 3 white stripes songs i dont love, but i still like all of it. But if I had to choose a favorite it would be the self titled cd. NIRVANA!!: they have this three disk CD thingy, titled Nirvana (hm..how orginial), thats the best one. Franz Ferinand: one of the CD's in my stereo now, is there one and only CD, self titled Phantom Planet: yes Carson, I do like some emo, both of Their CD's are awesome but the second one is my favorite Jimi Hendrix: Are you expierienced (or the greatest hits, but thats kinda cheating) Led Zepplin: IV and III Crystal Method: greatest techno band ever, um..it's the CD with the crab on it, damn, don't remember the name     Ramones: again I'm gonna cheat and say Greatest hits Red Hot Chili Peppers: By the Way Vines: Winning Day's Weezer: Pinkerton (yes more emo, but only pinkerton) VON BONDIES!!: amazing band, you have to buy Pawn Shoppe Heart Hives: Veni Vedi Vicuois (expect spelled right) Less than Jake: fine I give up, Hello Rockveiw and Anthem are good, but Pezcore still sucks!! Muse: have no idea what the album is... AC/DC: Back in Black, you HAVE to buy this Modest Mouse: damn the radio for over playing this song, this was MY song, i predicted it would get big and now everyone sings it :: sob:: Black Sabbath: We Sold our Souls for Rock and Roll, best quote ever..." I was into sex, drugs and rock and roll, was paying for the sex and the drugs"- Ozzy Bush: Sixteeth Stone, everything zen is a awesome song... Metallica: Saint Anger Green Day: (I'm cheating again) Greatest Hit's Yeah, that's a pretty good list but I'm sure I left someone out...

       This is an awesome story, it's the weirdest accident ever... A construction worker in Lancaster, Calif., is   expected to make a full recovery after accidentally being shot in the   head with a nail gun -- six times. Three of the nails penetrated his   brain; one entered his spinal column, but luckily not his spinal cord.   Witnesses say Isidro Mejia, 39, fell from the roof of the house he was   building onto another worker who was using the gun below. "The guy   holding the nail gun was grabbing to keep from falling, and just   gripped tighter on the trigger," said a Los Angeles County sheriff's   investigator. "It's a nail gun they use for framing. It can drive nails   through 2-by-4s." (Los Angeles Times) ...It's the first time L.A. cops   have said it: a Mexican guy really was framed.    urlLink pictures (don't worry, just x-rays)

Anyway, for all of you Vines lovers out there (like myself). Here's the most amazing music video ever!!!!!!...

       Your random history lesson of the day.  (Because it pertains to my 20th Century Project).  Franz, also known as Francis, Ferdinand was the Archduke of Austria-Hungary in 1914.  In early July, he and his wife were driving through the town of Sarajevo, Bosnia, when 19 year-old Gavrilo Princip stepped out of the crowd and opened fire.  This event triggered world war 1, one of the bloodiest military conflicts of all time.

       three awesome bands for you today... Bumblebeez 81- these guys r pretty garage rocky but all there songs r mixed by one of there own who is a pro dj so really cool sounding. Very slickly combining hives and white stripes...these guys have a video that im sure is gonna be playing on mtv very soon so look out for them.   Whirlwind Heat- i gurantee you have never and will never hear of these guys from anyone but me... they are very odd, have thier own flare, a personal favorite of mine...  The Dirtbombs- love LOVE these guys, very cool have two of every intersting, but are still pretty smooth and jazzy, kinda up beat too but still rocking  i have a few other bands that you should check out but arent as good and have no chance at stardom.... -The Soledad Brothers (blues...no one here would like them) -Blanche (smooth as silk)  OK, im done.. goodbye until next time...

       Is it just me, or are people neglecting good ol' BotD, their faithful blog, for the new RhythmSection blog?  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I do sorta have a preference (being a founder and all).  Keep BotD alive!  Post stuff!

       Back in the age of pirates, there was one ship that ruled the seas.  It was a typical pirate ship, with a typical captain.  The only strange thing was that the captain always wore a red shirt.  One day, one of the crew members went up to the captain and asked, "Why do you always wear that red shirt?"  "Oh that?" asked the captain.  "I wear that so that if I ever get shot, you will never see the blood, so that you can keep in fighting the same."  And so the guy walked away thinking  OK, that's pretty cool.  We've got a pretty great guy for our captain .  Later that day, an enemy ship started approaching.  The pirates got ready for battle, and started sailing towards the enemies.  They shot a few warning shots, which were responded with other shots.  Soon, both sides were almost ready to fight when the captain yelled back to the crew, "Quick!  Go get my brown pants!"
