      So... My curiousity and need to feel accepted by my friends has finally brought me here.... My name is Stacey and I am a blogger.&nbsp; What the H does that mean, anyway?&nbsp; I'll have to google it.&nbsp; I'm not sure that I have anything earth-shattering to share... but I guess we shall see.&nbsp;   I'd also like to mention that I had to put in about eight usernames before I got to this one... there must be a crap-load of people on this site... blogging away just like me.&nbsp; Hm... not sure where I was going with that.&nbsp; It was just annoying.&nbsp;   I have big plans for the evening... I'm going to finish watching the second season of Alias.&nbsp; I am a total Alias addict... which is funny 'cause I've never actually watched the show on it's broadcast night (it competes with The Sopranos.... please!).&nbsp; My old roommate and I watched the whole first season in a chinese food haze one Saturday afternoon... and I was hooked.&nbsp; I've discussed the unhealthy addiction with R, who pointed out that it was just like the crappy episodes of the X-Files....&nbsp; I apparently like the crappy episodes of the X-Files... don't judge me!&nbsp; Anyway... back to the riveting tale of my evening plans.&nbsp;   &nbsp;R has a gig tonight with the band that he hates.... I'm supporting his hatred by boycotting his show.... or something like that.&nbsp; I went to his show with "The Black Handed" last night.&nbsp; It was the loudest show that I have ever been too.&nbsp; I think it was partly because it was in a teeny, tiny room... but they were also turned up to 11 I think.&nbsp; The bass actually vibrated my bum cheeks &nbsp;(which may be too much info for ya... sorry.).&nbsp; It was a great show... it was really clear that they were having a blast... and they were certainly the best band that played.&nbsp;    I think that I have given you enough for today... one can only spew out so much meaningless drivvle before tiring.&nbsp; I think on my next post I may try to use less of the "..." ... what do you think?

      So Boston broke up with Nomar.  My mom is a wreck about it.  I felt a bit of a loss as well but I have been psyching myself up for it for months now.  I knew it was just a matter of time.  I still feel yucky from all of the pre-season bullsh*t that we went through with him (I make that statement as if I had somehow been a part of Red Sox Contract Negotiations this year....).  Nomar would never be a true "Sock" to me again....a true sox (in my admittedly optimistic... perhaps even blindly naive world) would play for a bologna sandwich and a blow-pop and be proud to be a part of the best ball team on the planet.  I expect nothing less.... I am a Red Sox fan.... I have no time for bad days or egos...  It was one of those moments in time that change everything- Nomar stopped loving Boston as much as Boston loved Nomar... Boston lived with it for awhile, trying to talk themselves into believing that everything was normal and okay... but in the end Boston had to break-up with Nomar... it was the right thing to do.  ... and that's all i have to say about that.  On another note... I feel jipped that the Democratic National Convention is over.  What the hell am I going to fill my evenings with this week?  It was like watching the biggest Pep Rally ever!  I guess I've never gotten into them before.... they are an F-ing Good Time!  It made me want to get more involved with the party.  It got me psyched up to vote for Kerry (that wasn't all that difficult to do.... but still).  It made me want to buy a button.  It did everything that it was supposed to do... It was the best.  I don't consider myself very politically saavy... I can hold my own in a debate about political beliefs, mind you, but I couldn't name three Senators if I tried.  Last week I spent every night glued to the tv with Melissa cheering on complete strangers.  It was crazy!  It was like watching Woostock- only without the dirt, acid, and burning guitars.  BTW: the best part of the whole Convention was that guy swearing over the air to the Balloon Guys in the rafters... did you see that?  It was a frickin riot!  Not five minutes after it happened it was already transcribed up on Drudge Report.... ah gotta love Drudge Report for getting down to the meat of things.  :)  And I'm spent..... peace out blog....
