      Not knitting news, but exciting for me, none the less!  After 2 years without lights in our upstairs hallway (after one fell and nearly hit our oldest on the head!)...we went to Lowe's today, picked out new lights and I installed them "all by myself" in under 30 minutes!! WOO HOO

      Well, I went and did it. Bought 10 balls of Hazy at the sale.. It just looks so lovely and I know there are other patterns in the Tape Thing book that I'll want to knit.  Am dithering over the Black Shadow since I know I'd wear black more often, but so far am resisting... so does anyone else have swatches to show?  am curious how slipping knitwise vs. purlwise changes the look of the pattern, if at all... later!

      Over the past few days I've been able to put in some time to starting Carla.  I'm using Cotton Tape in  urlLink Hazy .  For the first time in a while, I'm not having any doubts about my colour selection.  I'm really happy with this one!  Yesterday I ended up wondering through a few shops, looking a early fall clothes and I found that Hazy coordinates with a lot of items that I was drawn towards.  I didn't end up buying any thing to go with the sweater...that can wait until the sweater is completed.  Back to the matter at hand...did I swatch for Carla?  I had "swatched"**, however when I "swatched" I wasn't quite doing the pattern correctly.   urlLink Here's  an example of my fine skills of erroneously reading the pattern.  See the knit stitches every third stitch?  That's what you get when you risread where the asterisk is (ie: what stitches you should be repeating).  It was truely mistfying me what I was doing wrong, until I re-read the pattern.  The gauge of that 'swatch' is 10st to 10cm.  I believe the target is 9st to 10cm.  I figured that was close enough.    Since figuring out where I went wrong, I've since reworked the section above the ribbing (ie: the back of the sweater) things are looking much better.        This is much much better looking!    Knitting this sweater is going take concentration as some have pointed out, because it will be difficult to find the stitches after frogging.  So I'm being patient with this one!  I'm a little worried that I'll run out of yarn.  I always worry about that, but this time I quite nervous.  I ordered one extra ball, just in case, but wonder if I should have played safe and gotten two.  We'll see.  When I finished my first ball I had knit 21cm of the back (including the ribbing band, which used more yarn).  I'm going to lengthen the body by a few cm's as well as the arms to accomodate my height.  Let's keep our fingers crossed.    That's it for now!  Tomorrow I've got a 4 hour car journey and maybe I'll be able to put a dent into the second skein while driving..however I'm a little nervous of taking this as a car project.    ** I have a really bad habit of just starting the project and checking the gauge on the swatch once I've started.  Notice that my erroneous swatch had a ribbing band on the bottom as well.  tsk tsk!

      i finally got around to swatching! it took a bit more time than it should have because i kept forgetting to yarn over before the slip 1, k1, psso. so annoying. hopefully after i cast on i'll have it in my brain. otherwise, i'll have to count my stitches after every row to make sure that i haven't forgotten to do it! i'm having second thoughts about the color i chose, string. (photos later) boy, is it dull. i thought i wanted something neutral. i had considered glint, but that shade isn't quite warm enough against my skin. argh. anyway, string it is! who knows? maybe i'll grow to love it!  carla-alongers feel free to post to the blog through blogger. if for some reason you haven't received your blogger invite or need another one, please email me!

      Hi from Sally in Melbourne. Can I tell you about my colour choice for Carla?  I was tempted to use the same colour as in the It’s a Tape Thing booklet. The warm chocolate-y brown of Sullen is divine. But since I think half the fun of knitting garments for yourself is choosing a colour other that the one(s) in the pattern, I decided to make a bold and brave colour choice for my version of Carla.  I’ve chosen Electric, as it reminds me of the blue suede ankle boots I had in the 80s when I was a teenager. That electric blue makes me feel very nostalgic, for some strange reason. I never thought I’d get to the age when fashions from my teenage years would be back and I could relive being a teenager all over again (albeit in a more sophisticated, tasteful way!)  So, through Carla, I hope to become emersed in a bit of 80s nostalgia. My Carla will be called “Blue Suede Carla”.  Now, on to the knitting… (I’m casting on tomorrow).  By the way, I’m knitting the 34” size (I’m more a 36”) because (as the wise knitters here have already noted) this stitch and yarn are sure to stretch widthways.

      I started Carla in dusk a few days ago - I'm trying to finish Charlotte (only 11 rows to go!), but I could not resist any longer.  I am a little frustrated - I think I have knitted, and ripped, and knitted the same 4 rows 4 times today!  I keep ending up with extra stitches.  I guess I just can't knit this while sitting on the side of the trampoline with the kids or during supervision of a hugely bubble filled bath, again with the kids. :) I'll try again tomorrow!  Anyone else having a problem with extra rows?  If I get past this frustration, I'll post a pic tomorrow.

      i've been watching (and drooling over) everyone's progress and i just can't take it anymore!  i cancelled my original order for "it's a tape thing" which was placed about 2 weeks ago (and  still  not here) and sent another order through  urlLink jimmy bean's wool .  i couldn't resist the $4 shipping on any order (btw, they have cotton tape in enchant for $5.50/ball).  hopefully it gets here soon... i can't wait to begin!  everyone's progress so far looks amazing.

      here's the  urlLink link  to clara's step-by-step sleeve display. she says that she couldn't quite follow the pattern either, so she sort of fudged it. hers looks pretty good, though. i'm still a bit nervous. why i don't i just cast on for the second sleeve and worry about this later? =)

      ok. so i have cast off the first sleeve. i'm a bit confused by the making up. i'm having a difficult time visualizing how that's supposed to work. would someone care to explain this to me in the simplest terms possible? do i criss-cross the yarn back and forth over the stitch between the 2 dropped stitches as i move from the cuff to the top of the sleeve? it sucks that the book doesn't give you a close up shot of what it's supposed to look like. i feel nervous about this.

      Last week I was able to finish the first body piece of Carla.  The raglan decreases threw me for a bit of a loop the first time around, but I figured out that decreasing in twos (ie: k3tog) was key, so the second time around went much more smoothly!  Yesterday I cast off the second body pieces and here's what they currently look like:       Measuring the pieces has become a bit of a challenge, as the fabric is soooo stretchy.  If I were more of a detailed oriented person, as some of you may be, I'd count the rows for each pieces so that you know you're knitting them identically.  I didn't do this, nor do I currently have the patience to do it, so I'm hoping that it will all come out right in the end.    So now I'm zipping along on my first sleeve:       Not bad for only getting about an hour's worth of time knitting it last night.  I had to remember  urlLink Clara's post  about the sleeve to know that I'm doing ok.  It may not currently look like what the finished sleeve, but that's because of the dropped stitches that happen in the st-st part later.

      I just received my copy of  It's a Tape Thing  [woo hoo!], so I'll be knitting "Carla" very soon. I'll be using Cotton Tape in Glint, which I've had in my stash for a while now and have been wanting to use. I've also been wanting to knit a lacy sweater to wear with my jeans or capri pants over a strappy top, and Carla fits the bill. I'm excited about finally getting to knit a lacy sweater, and making a bit of a dent in my stash, to boot. I knit using Cotton Tape before, and love how it just rolls on the needles. Very lightweight to wear, too. I'll be starting Carla week, and will most likely be cross-posting between here and my own site at skinnyrabbit.com.  Thanks to Shobhana for hosting this knitalong! Knitalongs make the knitting all the sweeter :-)

      i was originally going to make my carla out of lana grossa's tre, but changed my mind once i found out yarn expressions was having a sale on the cotton tape.  boy, am i glad i changed my mind.  i received my cotton tape saturday and couldn't believe how light and heavenly it is.  i chose the color bamboo and i'm still deciding if i like it.  i'm hoping my book arrives today.  i can't wait to get this sweater started.

      i finished my back and drank a glass of wine beforehand to reason what i was going to do with the decreases. i went ahead and co 4 for the first two rows and decided to continue on with the pattern to finish with 16 stitches instead of the stated 18. i'm thinking that maybe i should've just co 2 at for those first two rows instead and would have ended with the 18 stitches, but i'm going to sleep on it. it also was a little shorter than 37 cm, but oh well.

      Well, I sat down last night to do my tension square and for some reason I just couldn't get the pattern to work.  I was making all manner of mistakes.  In the end I had to come upstairs to look at Loriz's picture of her swatch.  Thank you Loriz for posting that - it really helped me clear up what I was doing wrong!  Now I can't get gauge.  On 9mm needles I am just under gauge and on 10mm needles I am W-A-Y over for some reason (I also don't like the fabric!).  So I've decided to go with the 9mm needles and hope that being cotton it stretches ever so slightly.  Now I am hoping the whole shoulder shaping issue gets resolved before I get that far!

       	 		 		 after much wrangling with the armholes, i have completed the back! it came out a little long. measuring is a tricky thing with this fabric. i ended up with 39 cm instead of 37 before the armholes.  happy birthday jacqueline! good luck with glint! 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink carla080404 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink shobhana .

      It's Arrived!    My Cotton Tape is here all the way from Colourway to Melbourne, Australia in only 4 working days!  How quick is that!  Unfortunately, I am regretting the colour choice - big time! I was oscillating between Hazy and Glint and chose Glint in the end. My only hope is that, like Shobhana, when I start knitting it up, I will grow to love it.  I plan on swatching tonight and hopefully casting on tomorrow...which incidently is my birthday - so I don't imagine I'll get a whole heap done and then I am off to Tasmania for a weekend away.   But next week will be all systems go!!!  On a seperate note, has anyone thought of emailing the design gurus at Rowan with the question about the armhole shaping.  I am happy to do it - but until I actually get to that section of the pattern myself, I am kinda a bit vague as to what you all mean.

      and i'm already confused!  so i'm making the medium and starting to cast off 3 stitches at the beginning of the next 2 rows, but that throws me off the s1, k1, psso repeat.  i'm thinking that i need to cast off the 3 stitches and be set up to go right into the s1 of the pattern.  what am i missing?

      i started the carla a while ago in swish and am really loving the pattern and color.  i'm pretty close to starting the armhole decreases and wondering how much you guys stretched the sweater to get to the 37 cm.  right now i'm at 33 cm, is 4 cm too much?

      I decided to make the medium because I don't want it to be too snug across the waist/hips.  I'm realizing it might stretch out too much and that it won't be too tight. If I make the small, will it be too snug in the arm hole/ shoulder area?  That seems to be the problem with store bought sweaters in small vs. medium.   I might start the front in the small size just to see.

      these armhole decreases are driving me crazy! the pattern tells you to keep the pattern correct as you cast off. i kept ending up with the wrong # of stitches. i ripped back and reknit about 4 times. now i have the right number of sts, but the pattern and the stitch count will be off when i work the following 4 rows! i am so aggravated. i am sure there is a solution, but i'm too worked up to sit down and figure it out right now.

       	 		 		 this is knitting up so-o-o quickly! and thus far i am really pleased with the results. if you are in doubt about which size to make, i would suggest going with a smaller size because a) this top will look terrible if it's too big and baggy and b) because it's 100% cotton it's going to stretch like crazy. i suspect it really needs to be fitted to look good. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink carla080104 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink shobhana .
