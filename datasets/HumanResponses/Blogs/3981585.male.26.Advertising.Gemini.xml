      Hello, below you will find a very romantic love story, it has stretched on for over a decade,   please feel free to comment on this epic still unfolding...   enjoy   &nbsp;     A LOVE STORY      &nbsp;  Ok well here is the story,  &nbsp;  I 1986 I met my soulmate and her name was cat, she was 7 years old and I was 8 years old. We swore we would be married and we loved each other, I know how weird it sounds but even nat that young age we did love, maybe ot the kind of love you think of now, but it was love.  &nbsp;  In the two years we were together in a childrens home we were inseperable, we caused a lot of problems at this place, because none of the staff members wanted to let us be together.  &nbsp;  I wont go into the details of the time we spent there, it wont help in understanding what I have to say.  &nbsp;  In the year of 1988 I was discharged from this home and sent to another one far away, and cat was being sent home to be with her parents again.  &nbsp;  When I arrived at my new home I wrote to cats home, and received a letter back a couple of days later, and I replied.  &nbsp;  A day later I received a letter back, I was so excited I tore it out of the envelope without reading it, I opened the letter and started to read….  &nbsp;  It said “dearest cat, how I miss seeing your face…..”  &nbsp;  I looked at it in shock, I was reading my letter, I looked at the now torn envelope and stared in horror at the red letters “ address of occupant unknown” looking back at me.  &nbsp;  I had made a vow to cat to find her and for us to reunite someday, and I spent 16 years of my life looking for her.  &nbsp;  In the time I looked for her I will summarize briefly what took place, there were five private investigators, numerous trips to her town, and showing people her photos, tons of papers and maps and photos of the area and canvassing of local spots, and also several documents like copys of birth certificate, search for death records.  &nbsp;  I found lots from my search, but never did I find beautiful cat until……  &nbsp;  I have traveled back to my hometown in maine, I have been living in south Dakota for the past few years, and I suffered some emotional damage there. (posted in another forum)  &nbsp;  Needless to say I continued searching for her when I arrived, I was shocked to see her phone number in a book, not unlisted just waiting to be called.  &nbsp;  I called the number and received an answering machine, it said “blah blah blah cat and *** leave a message” could I have found my soulmate, it didn’t seem likely and what should I say, well I hung up.  &nbsp;  The next two days I called twice a day, and received the machine bu on the third night I received a voice on the other end.  &nbsp;  “ hello” , hi how are you, “im good and you” im great, sorry too call so late “oh its ok, ummm …. Who is this”  &nbsp;  it was kinda comical, but I asked if she was cat, I asked if her middle name was the one I said, and I finally asked if her moms name and dads name were as I said and she confirmed all of that.  &nbsp;  The final question was had she ever been to that home, and she said yes she had spent time there when she was a child.  &nbsp;  So I found her at last and identified myself.  &nbsp;  In the next few days we exchanged emails and finally a couple of phone calls, and she was very excited to meet me again.  &nbsp;  I will paste those emails in here for all to see, and to see if something was missed.  &nbsp;  I will tell you the final result was we never met, she said something about wanting to leave the apst in the past and how very sorry she was.  &nbsp;  I don’t know if ill ever understand, in the emails and texts you will feel a sense of I do I don’t happening, I don’t know if this is relevant.  &nbsp;  Any advice after review would be great  &nbsp;  Jay  &nbsp;  First email from me (right after phone call)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;      Date:   Wed, 9 Jun 2004 14:36:49 -0700 (PDT)    From:   "free atlast"  &nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink  Add to Address Book     Subject:   hello    To:   **********9@yahoo.com    well hello cat?  &nbsp;  its been 16 years, i cant believe i got to talk to you  &nbsp;  i am having trouble accessing the web, (stupid dial up) but i will give you a list of ways to contact me if you choose  &nbsp;  first do you have a cell phone (who doesnt right ) i have two)  &nbsp;  if you have free long distance (usaually incluyded) you can call me anytime  &nbsp;  here are some numbers  &nbsp;  my dads (phil)&nbsp; 207-784  my cell&nbsp; roaming at 2.00 minute (but i will answer and you can call my dads)  605-728-  &nbsp;  or reply to this address  &nbsp;   urlLink freeatlasst@yahoo.com   &nbsp;  i dont really know what more to say  &nbsp;  i am thanking god i found you, i dont know the future, but it is so cool  &nbsp;  we have alot of catching up to do (16 years is a lifetime)  &nbsp;  i cant wait to hear from you, and i cant believe you have a daughter  &nbsp;  i do too her name is **** and she is almost 3  &nbsp;  looking forward to the next time we can talk  &nbsp;  sorry if i spooked you the other night, imagine how i felt (it was like talking to a ghost)  &nbsp;  later "cat"  &nbsp;  BEST TIME TO REACH ME IS AFTER 9 PM LOCAL TIME)  &nbsp;  jason  &nbsp;  PS I WILL HAVE A PIC OF ME SOON (YOU WONT RECOGNIZE ME, SEND ME ONE OF YOU :)  Reply to that email from cat  Hi again. I am sending you a picture of me. I probably look way different. I did do some modeling here and there throughout my life. This picture is from a calandar I did. Send me a pic. of you soon, if you want. I'm curious to see if you look the same, or if I even recognize you. Hope to hear from ya soon. Take care for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cat  Reply to her email  Dear Cat ****  &nbsp;  Wow, where do I begin, for starters you do look WAY DIFFERENT then when I saw you last, 16 years did a lot of good to you, I always knew that you were going to be and did turn out to be a very lovely young woman.  I laughed when I thought of showing my friends your picture and telling them “ that girl gave me my first kiss and was my first love”, I didn’t show them of course, they would never believe me.  &nbsp;Once I downloaded your picture I sat and stared at it for awhile, no kidding, I covered up your body with a piece of paper, and after awhile I decided it was the same little cat I left behind in Saco in 1988.  &nbsp;It is really weird how the month you posed for is MAY!  &nbsp;Your body has changed and you have gotten taller, but your face still shows the little girl I knew back in sweetser. I am proud of you for doing what you wanted in life, but if its not to forward of me, I think you would have been a spectacular model.  &nbsp;I remember the day I left sweetser, you probably don’t, but you cried real hard, and you ran in the backyard in the trees when I left, you couldn’t believe that they were splitting us apart, we had vowed to be together forever.  &nbsp;Time has taken us so far away in this life, but after 16 years we found each other again (ok well I found you, you probably forgot about me right?) I still have your letters somewhere, they still have lipstick on them, and you loved to do stuff like that.  &nbsp;I have included a couple of pictures from around sweetser era, to help you identify me, but the best way is to see if you have any necklaces in your possession, it would be very old now, but I had an Indian make it for you in cape Elizabeth and you swore you would never lose it or take it off, if you find that necklace you will find our childhood memories and also a picture of myself and you at a place called schooner golf course (its inside the locket on the chain) if you have lost it I forgive you, I never lost your memory.  &nbsp;I once almost found you in *******, and I searched many years, but fate wouldn’t allow it, I cant tell you how many trips I took to ***** to find you, and how many times I walked Preble st., munjoy hill, and downtown ******** showing people your picture.  &nbsp;You said you have a daughter ***** I am so proud of you for that, I fear I know little about raising children but I have one little menace (lol) of my own, and I love her more then the world.  &nbsp;It’s weird to know we could stand in line at a market and never now who the other was, time changes our appearances, our lifestyles, but our hearts always stay the same and cannot change.  &nbsp;16 years is a lifetime and I don’t even know where to begin, I m sure you have a wonderfully satisfying life and I don’t want to disrupt it in anyway. I always wondered what happened to “my little Cat”, I thought you had passed on for a bit, but then I saw your number in the book, I once called that number often, no answer there though.  &nbsp;When you picked up the phone the other night I had no idea what to say, or where to begin. I envisioned you hanging up on me, and I was so scared when you didn’t, because I hadn’t planned to say anything more.  &nbsp;I would love to see you again, maybe have dinner (I don’t think coffee will cover it, unless you drink REAAALLL slow J) if that would be ok with you.  I must warn you the years haven’t been kind to me and I am quite unattractive, the women who have been in my life followed you and went for my heart. I am probably being harsh but I want you to know I am no tom cruise.  &nbsp;I am very nervous and excited to see you again, and to hear all about your life.  I can give you a little background about me here,  &nbsp;I own 6 radio stations out west, I was raised in homes, and got my ged from Lewiston high, I went to college for computer science and I started working in radio when I was 17, and I have been in it ever since. My first job was at WBLM the “blimp” cleaning floors, we all had to start somewhere right?  I moved to South Dakota in 1999, I fell in love with a beautiful woman, and we had a daughter in 2001, my daughters name is sierra Nicole, and I miss her much. Sierras mother just slept with my best friend in front of me, breaking my heart in two and ending a four-year relationship with the woman I thought would one day be my wife.  &nbsp;I took a leave of absence to come home to Maine and see my family and old friends.  I never even thought about finding you it was totally accidental.  &nbsp;I emailed my buddy for some pictures of a tornado we had, and he accidentally sent me a pic of sweetser back, and I heard they just had a fire.  &nbsp;Anyway that’s all for now, I am totally excited about what’s up with your life, don’t be shy, I know someone like you must have had an interesting one, lol.  &nbsp;I would call you again but I don’t know what your feelings are on it, and I don’t want to freak you.&nbsp; I will tell you im as harmless as I was when I was ten, lol, im a lover not a fighter, and I wouldn’t hurt anyone.  &nbsp;  Just wanted you to know  &nbsp;I included a face sheet from my company (stupid records) it has a pic  &nbsp;(Can you send me a few of you around sweetser time)? I was thinking how embarrassing it would be if I had the wrong person, although from the pic I don’t think so, and see if you can tell me ANYTHING about sweetser or your time there)  HINT: ETERNAL FLAME)  &nbsp;  I will check my email tonight (Friday) late  &nbsp;  Until next time we “meet”  &nbsp;  Yours  &nbsp;  Jason  CATS REPLY (my replys to her are In bold)  &nbsp;  Hi. Thanks for the reply. I&nbsp;definitely remember now by seeing the picture of you when you were younger. (I WILL TRY TO GROSS YOU OUT AND GET YOU SOME BETTER PIX) The picture of you older is very hard to see, but you still look very similar. I think that is one of the most disrespectful and disgusting things I have ever heard of a chic doing. Having sex with your best friend right in front of you!! WOW, I wouldn't know what to do. I'm sorry that happened. (I WILL NOT BRING MY HORRIBLE KRAP IN YOUR LIFE, IF WE TOUCH ON IT ITS FINE, BUT DON’T LET ME RUIN THIS CHANCE ON KRAP, IF I BORE YOU SPEAK UP OR SLAP ME (LOL) As far as me trying to remember stuff about Sweetser, I try not to. I had some fun there, but it wasn't a great experience for me all in all. So, I'm sorry if I can't come up with any memories of my own on the subject. But I honestly like when you do, and it does bring a lot of the good stuff up that I had forgotten. I honestly blocked a lot of that out of my mind I believe, so it's cool that you remember so much about it, because I don't unfortunately. (ONE MORE MEMORIE FOR YOU THEN: I DON’T REMEMBER THE PLACE, BUT WE WERE SWIMMING, AND WE WENT OUT TO THE DEEP END AND WE WERE KISSING UNDERWATER, STAFF SAW US AND CALLED THE WHOLE GROUP IN FOR A “BUDDY COUNT” THEY THEN SEPERATED US FOR THE DAY, BUT LATER THAT NIGHT YOU RAN DOWN THE BOYS HALL TO MY ROOM, WE HAD “JOEY, KYLE, AND ERNIE” WATCHING THE HALL, YOU SHOWED UP IN MY ROOM AT 12 AND I HELPED YOU OUT MY WINDOW AND AROUND THE COTTAGE INTO YOUR WINDOW AT 3 AM, IF STAFF HAD COME IN THEY WOULD HAVE KILLED US, WE PUT MANY OVER ON THEM, ILL TELL YOU MORE SOON.) I am interested in chatting with you as well. Coffee, lunch, dinner; whatever. It doesn't matter. (IF YOU STILL LIKE SHRIMP THEN WE COULD GO TO A NICE PLACE CALLED DEMILLOS, IT IS A BEAUTIFUL RESTAURANT ON THE BAY, OR WE COULD GO QUICKIE AT ARBYS, LOL IT IS UP TO YOU, WHATEVER, DEMILLOS IS FANCY, AND ARBYS IS… WELL I ONCE WENT IN AN ARBYS NAKED ON A COLLEGE DARE. SOOOO) I don't have any picks of me back then, my mom has them all in ***. I have some, but I'd have to really dig and probably wouldn't come up with much(WHATEVER YOU CAN GET COOL, I SEEM TO REMEMBER A PICTURE OF YOU OR YOUR SISTER IN STALKINGS ON A LEATHER COUCH WITH A BROWN TEDDY BEEAR, I DON’T KNOW WHY) Don't worry, you are talking with the right chic,(PLEASE DO ME A FAVOR and stop calling yourself A “CHIC” YOU MAY HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU WERE THAT, BUT TO ME YOU WILL ALWAYS BE “MY LITTLE CAT” YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY AND YOU NEED TO RESPECT YOURSELF)IM NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO)&nbsp; when I saw the pic of you at that age,&nbsp; instantly remembered you.(TELL ME WHAT YOU REMEMBER) I don't have that necklace, unfortunately. (I AM SORRY, ILL GET YOU SOMETHING, IT WONT HAVE OUR PICTURE, UNLESS WE GET DRUNK AND TAKE SOME IN A PHOTO BOOTH(LMAO)When I got my first apartment at 16 years old, I partyed a lot and got evicted. The landlord threw out all of my stuff, so I lost a lot of the "memory stuff" that I had saved which included a lot of photo albums, letters, and memorabelia.(WOW I ALWAYS PICTURED YOU THE SWEET YOUNG COED THAT STUDYED AT HOME AND WAS GOOD AT MATH)OH WELL I BET YOU ARE STILL FUN, AND WITH A SPIRIT LIKE YOURS IM NOT THAT SURPRISED) Well, email me back and maybe we can plan when to meet again. Take care until then.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cat  &nbsp;  (SORRY ABOUT THE WEAK EMAIL, TELL ME ALL ABOUT YOUR LIFE, YOUR GOALS, PLANS, AND DREAMS, SO WHEN WE MEET IT WONT BE SO AWKWARD)  &nbsp;  I REALIZE IN MEETING YOU I MAY FIND THINGS ABOUT YOU WHICH MAY BOTHER ME AND LIKEWISE, BUT TO SEE YOU AGAIN ILL TAKE THE CHANCE)  &nbsp;  ONE MORE MEMORY ( “ETERNAL FLAME” BY THE BANGLES WAS “OUR SONG”)  &nbsp;  ONE LAST THING, TELL ME ALL YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE  MUSIC  SCHOOL  LIFE  DAUGHTER  TOTAL STATUS  FUTURE GOALS  &nbsp;  ANYTHING!!!!!!  &nbsp;  UNTIL NEXT TIME (JAY)  &nbsp;  PS DO YOU HAVE ANY PHOTOS ON THE PC, OF RECENT OR A FEW YEARS BACK?  &nbsp;  Remember how we talked about the days I did construction, it was a few years ago, maybe 1999 or so, we paved the old ***** rd it runs out to the maine youth center it took forever, anyway my brother lives down there, and I went and saw him today, he lives on **** circle in ********, when I was leaving he told me ****** road was right next to him!!!! Were you there all this time, I was so close in 1999 why didn’t I find you, anywhoo when I left I turned out of his road and went down I think powers ave or something, and there it was ******* rd, I don’t know if I was on the right “*******rd” but let me ttell you what I did see,  &nbsp;  Know don’t freak out, I am not stalking you, just telling you what I saw,  &nbsp;  The book said you were at 30 ******* rd, I went by a green house with two doors one said 30 and the other 56?, in the driveway on the far side was a old car with maine plates, in the other driveway facing the street was a “Honda” with texas plates, didn’t you say on the phone your mom was out in texas.  &nbsp;  Anyway I drove by, and got a weird shiver that I was closer to you then I ever was before, but I didn’t stop, I had no idea if I was even near the right place, and I wasn’t mentally prepared to meet you, but like I said, I was probably in the wrong place anyway, but if I wasn’t it is strange to know how close you have been all this time, (my brothers, the flagging site) I guess fate wasn’t on my side until now.  &nbsp;  I sincerely hope I didn’t freak you, if I did I am sorry, I just wanted to see if I was near your house, or somewhere far off, lol  &nbsp;  It felt really really weird when I drove by, a warm shiver, I cant describe it, they say if we get detached from our true love first love soulmate krap, they send out a signal and if we get close we feel the energy,( to many stupid karma stories I guess)  &nbsp;  Oh well I cant wait for your reply, im sure it will be interesting….  &nbsp;  Jay  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  This is the reply from her with my reply in bold again  &nbsp;  REPLY IS IN BOLD  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hi. You don;t look "ugly" at all. Like the advise you gave me, maybe you should respect yourself more. You look like a handsome man.(THANK YOU FOR THE COMPLIMENT) I call every girl chic, even myself sometimes. It's like when guys call each other dude. When I was reading your reply, I remember those guys; Joey , Kyle and Ernie. I wish I could come up with some memories for you, but I the only ones I reallly have are the ones you speak of, you kinda refresh my memory. I blocked almost all of it out. I remember a slip and slide,(NEVER FORGOT THAT HUH?) playing softball, and going to the beach.(WE DD THAT A LOT!) And believe me, I remember always getting bitched out by some staff member for doing something "inappropriate". I was a wild one, always have been. I've settled down a bit ever since I found out I was pregnant with Layla. I am definately much more mature now. I think we should start out by just meeting for cofee at a coffe shop first,(SOUNDS GOOD) that would make me the most comfortable. I am not freaked out by you at all, but the fact is that I don't know you right now.(THAT IS A VALID POINT, I COULD BE DERANGED, I AM NOT REALLY!!! BUT YOU ARE A WISE MOTHER AND A SMART WOMAN, AND I RESPECT YOU FOR THAT) Maybe if that goes well, we could then go out to dinner or something.(THAT WOULD BE LOVELY(I DIDN’T EXPECT TO MARRY YOU RIGHT AWAY (JOKE)(LOL) Does that sound okay to you? As far as all the things you listed that you wanted to know, we can talk about most of that at coffee, if that's alright?(TO THIS DAY YOUR SUCH A TEASE, ALWAYS KEEPING THE GOOD STUFF UNTIL LAST, LOL, MY LITTLE CAT, NEVER XHANGED, I LOVE IT) I'll send you another pic of me k(SEND&nbsp; ME ONE WHERE I CAN SEE YOU, PLEASE TELL ME YOU WERENT ACTUALLY SLEEPING IN THAT!!!, GOD I WOULD HAVE HAD THAT OFF OF YOU IN …. UMM SORRY FORCE OF HABIT, YOU LOOKED LOVELY AND STUNNING IN THAT PHOTO (I WANT ONE LIKE THE CALENDAR, BUT AN EVERYDAY ONE, THE ONE I SENT YOU IS OF TWO DAYS AGO, MAKE IT A GOOD ONE THAT’S RECENT, AND CAN I SEE YOUR DAUGHTERS PIC (IF THAT WOULD MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE I UNDERSTAND ) IM SENDING YOU ONE OF MY FAMILY, THE ONE I LOST). Then maybe you can email me back and let me know if coffe's ok,(I HATE COFFEE, BUT I WILL MEET YOU WHEREVER YOU CHOOSE (ACROSS FROM A POLICE STATION, IN A CROWDED ROOM, OR ON THE BAY AT SUNSET(LOL) IT DOESN’T MATTER TO ME) and we can set a time to meet at a coffee shop? Bye for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cat  &nbsp;  (SWEETSER MEMORY: THE DAY SOMEONE RAN AWAY, AND THEY PUT ALL OF US IN THE HALL UNTIL THEY FOUND THEM, WE WERE TRYING TO HOLD HANDS, AND EVERYTIME “GAIL MADORE” CAME UP ON US WE WOULD LET GO, SHE HATED IT, ALWAYS WANTED TO CATCH US IN THE ACT.  &nbsp;  SWEETSER MEMORY: WHEN WE USED TO DO DISHES IN THE PANTRY(BEFORE THEY FIGURED OUT WE WERE SWEETHEARTS) I REMEMBER THIS AS LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY, WE WERE DRYING DISHES, YOU WERE VERY CLOSE TO ME, THAT DAY YOU WERE WEARING A RED DRESS WITH WHITE RUFFLES AND HEARTS ON THE BOTTOM EDGES, AND YOU WALKED UP TO ME AND GOT ON YOUR TIPPY TOES, AND PLANTED A KISS ON MY CHEEK, IT WAS MY VERY FIRST KISS AND ONE OF THE MANY WE HAD TOGETHER, I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU THE MOMENT I SAW YOU THAT FIRST DAY IN THE HALL, BUT MY HEART EXPLODED THAT DAY IN THE PANTRY, I HOPE YOURS DID TOO.)  &nbsp;  SWEETSER MEMORY (MINE) WHEN I WOULD GET STAFF SO PISSED, THEY WOULD CALL “NORM CANTERA” AND “JOHN CENTER” IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, AND THEY WOULD RUN ME DOWN THE OLD “DUMP ROAD” UNTIL I WAS SO TIRED I DIDN’T WANT TO PLAY GAMES ANYMORE, AND I FEEL ASLEEP IN MY CEREAL BOWL AT BREAKFAST)  &nbsp;  UNTIL NEXT TIME  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  (shortly after this I talked to cat on yahoo messenger, I have included this entire conversation, it is very importat to understanding what is taking place  &nbsp;  freeatlasst: well hello  freeatlasst: :D  freeatlasst: well when you said you were a tiger you werent kidding  freeatlasst: you meant it literally lol  freeatlasst: hello?

I bet you are one hell of a guy, and I've enjoyed chatting with you. I am at a space in my life where I need to have as less comotion going on as possible. Something tramatic happened to me last week, and I still haven't gotten over it. I can't lie I am interested in meeting you, but I'm thinking maybe we should leave it alone. We were kid, babies almost, and our interests have changed about each other since we were that young. I am sorry if I am disappointing you!

I look forward to meeting you soon and chatting face to face. Hopefully you'll be able to get out of work early today and call. See ya soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Friend,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cat (Lynn) lol  (I sent a email to reply to her it is below  i missed you cat for so many years, and now your here, your in my thoughts, and i wait on every breath till our eyes meet again,  i hope that wasnt to romantic for you, i am quite good at it (maybe you will see someday) i am in the process of writing a poem dedicated to you.  &nbsp;i got out of work at 3 pm, got home around 4 30 and new i really wanted to see you, but i also realized our time would be brief and i dont think i wanted that, i have waited for 16 years to find you, i can wait a little longer.  i am going to send you&nbsp;SOME pictures of me, its taken today, how recent is that. (no rubbing one off to it) lol  (WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE, I WANT YOU TO PRETEND YOU DONT KNOW ME, WELL WAHT I MEEAN IS ANSWER THIS, IF YOU WERE GOING ON LOOKS ONLY!!, WHAT WOULD YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH, THE KID OR THE ADULT)  JUST CURIIOUS BECAUSE IM UGGGGGGGGGGGLLLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYY  i have thought about where we should go after we meet, what path to take, and i have decided to leave it up to destiny (lol) that if for some reason the years didnt remove the feelings, that the pull is there (you get the idea)  if that isnt the case, and we wind up not standing each other, i will know you survived and became a woman i am proud to know.  thank you for being in my life, and thank you for showing me love doesnt come from looks or money, it comes from the heart, it was that lesson that you taught me in sweetser that i took into my life, it was you cat lynn, that helped me realize at the youngest age possible, that love knows no bounds and knows no&nbsp; surrender.  god bless you cat *********  jason *****  i will be in touch soon (heh heh heh) o btw i sorta got really turned on by your pictures, i want you to know you are HOTTTTT.  lol  &nbsp;  IM HAVING CONFLICTIONS AS TO THE BEST ONE FOR "WALLPAPER"  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  . shortly after this I spoke with her again, and she gave me the news  &nbsp;  I sent a final email and I haven’t heard from her, I don’t really expect to but I just needed to find out what idid wrong if anything.  Here is the final email  (please read this in its entirety (thank you)  &nbsp;  Hello there cat,  &nbsp;  I just got off the phone with you, and first off, please disregard that email I just sent, I was trying to go along a different line then we are now.  &nbsp;  I must say I am very saddened by what you told me, all of the text and emails and conversations pointed to you being happy to see me again.  &nbsp;  Please let me extend my sincerely heartfelt apologies and sympathies to you for all the bad things that happened to you in sweetser.  &nbsp;  It is a time that I will never forget, and one you want to so badly.  &nbsp;  I searched 16 years of my life to almost find you again (almost because we never got to meet) I tried to keep my promise to you, please remember that.  &nbsp;  I am not sure what made you change your mind, you were always so quizzical and you still are.  &nbsp;  Was it fear, disgust, uncertainty, or did I just make you feel uncomfortable.  &nbsp;  I will never know the answers to these questions; it is possible that maybe you just didn’t have the strength inside to face me, and you were rattled by the fact that my coming into your life again could bring new things or circumstances you are not ready for.  &nbsp;  I will not try to guess what the reason is; the time has passed for that.  &nbsp;  Im going to tell you something very important to me, I hope with all my heart you listen to what I say now:  &nbsp;  I never was afraid to tell you anything, and I wont know, I am shedding a tear for the my lost love right now, my tears fell after we got off the phone because I don’t cry in front of anyone, and I rarely do, unless my heart feels pain I cant beat.  &nbsp;  I am feeling that pain now.  &nbsp;  None of this is your fault, you were just going about your life when I called, and truthfully I had no right. I know I said I was fulfilling a vow, but you told me best we were just kids, and none of that mattered to you. I understand that more then I can tell you.  &nbsp;  It seems silly that I cry over someone I never really knew, maybe it’s the pain of the recent struggles I had in my life, or maybe its something else.  &nbsp;  One thing is for sure, a part of my heart died today, it was the part that held you in it and the hope that one day we would see each other again.  &nbsp;  Oh I am a big boy, I will survive like I always do, I will "land on my feet" eventually ill look back and say, " I understand".  &nbsp;  I want you to know I never meant to hurt&nbsp;you, or to scare you, or to bring up painful past memories, you and your daughter are strong and she has a wonderful mother and she will more then likely grow to have your heart, compassion, and strength.  &nbsp;  On June 19th 2004, I will go to Casco bay line in south Portland, I will park my car and I will buy two passenger tickets to the island we spoke of, I will board the 5:45 p.m. ferry and I will have pictures of you (converted to 4x6 prints) with me, the ones you sent me of course, I will more then likely also have the books that I have (maps, photos, data, disks,) that I used to find&nbsp;you.  &nbsp;  When I am out on the bay I will release these into the Casco bay (kind of titanic poetic going on) and say goodbye to my lost cat, you said you loved water and I confess the ocean is one of my favorite things as well.  &nbsp;  I will get off the ferry on the island, watch the sunset, and then return to Portland.  &nbsp;  When I dock I will have laid your memory to rest, I believe I will cry a lot on that trip, but hey im only human right.  &nbsp;  I will get in my car, and I&nbsp;will delete your numbers from my cell phone, and I will drive to my fathers house in Lewiston, and a short time after that I will leave this state for the last time in my life.  &nbsp;  I will remove your emails from my computer and the address and im name from yahoo.  &nbsp;  You will most likely never hear from me again.  &nbsp;  If you wish, I said I would buy two tickets, one is for me and the other is for&nbsp;you, mark my words I will be there on the bible I swear, I asked you to take all that was going on in your life and close your eyes, to take a leap of faith, to imagine things that you cant see, and to open your heart and soul to things that you cant feel.  &nbsp;  You told me you agreed with a lot of what I said, and I would like to believe that is true.  &nbsp;  There is no way we can see the future, and we shouldn’t dwell in the past.  &nbsp;  I want you to know something now&nbsp; that it doesn’t matter anymore,  &nbsp;  I never stopped loving you or wanting your touch, that through all my life I wanted nothing greater then to see your face again, anything more I will leave in my heart, the place where it will always belong.  &nbsp;  If you do decide that just maybe, there are things we cannot understand or see, and that through all your hectic and scary life right now, that you could just take a leap of faith, then I encourage you to join me on that ferry, you don’t have to come, although a part of me really believes you might, and if you don’t I will understand and continue on in my life.  If you do decide to show up, please come early, the boat leaves at 5:45 and I will be a half hour early.  &nbsp;  Something I want to point out to you, unlike times in the past (you know) when choices were made for you, you are a mature adult and this choice is yours, no one can make it for you, and no one will feel the results more then you will.  &nbsp;  It is your choice.  &nbsp;  If you choose not to come, please cherish me and our memories (whatever you can remember) in your heart.  &nbsp;  I believed we were soul mates all of my life, and I believe someday (maybe not here on earth) we will be together again.  &nbsp;  Goodbye cat Lynn (cat) I will never forget you  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Thiis is the end of the whole 16 years, I guess I just want feedback, maybe someone out there nows why, or can tell me what to do.
