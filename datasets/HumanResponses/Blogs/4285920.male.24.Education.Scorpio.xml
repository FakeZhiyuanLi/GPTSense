       Last night i had the "pleasure" of chaperauing(spelling?) a Highschool dance. The school i teach at is a All boys prep school so needless to say it was a eruption of hormones on a Mt. Vesuvius sort of level. My job technically was to make sure nobody got to intimate with their partner on the dance floor. But c'mon... it's not really in my make up to be like "hey get your hand off her ass". Shit Go for it Lil Playa. I mean if she reaches up and smacks him across the face, that lesson will stay with the kid alot longer than if i was to scold him.  Also the young ladies at this dance were kill'n me. You would have thought it was ladies night at the mercury room by what they had on. Needless to say some of my buddies were fired up to go out afterwards, I on the other hand hit the rack because this morning we had a scrimmage down in LaMarque, Texas which is an hour away. So i figured I shouldn't expect my players to stay home and rest if im not so i packed it in much to my buddies chagrin. Im now back from the scrimmage and in search of a beer and a nap.   A burly Irishman is drinking in a bar. A tiny gay fellow sits beside him. After a few beers, the gay guy whispers, “Do you want a blow job?”The gigantic man flips out, roars in anger, and tosses the little guy out of the bar, then returns to his stool.The shocked bartender says, “I’ve never seen you react like that. What did that guy say?”“Dunno. Something about a job.”

       "See what happens when you drink kids" As i got in the shower the this morning I had that blurry slightly amneisic feeling of what happend last night? Aggie Ring? Check, Wallet? Check, Dignity?, Up for debate. Then it hits me "CRAP" you started an Internet Blog. I almost wanted the "crap the stripper stole my wallet" feeling instead of the "damn is email not enough, i must post random drivle for the internet masses".I tried this once before but failed miserably. Now that I have something some what interesting to write about and a little more free time, i'll give it a go. Well i now have to get back to the exciting world of American History and how Columbus enslaved the indians.  There's a doctoer, a lawyer, a priest and a boy scout on a airplane. The plane is about to crash and there is only one parachute. The doctor says "lets give it to the child, it's the humanitarian thing to do." The lawyer replies "f*ck the kid I want..." the priest interupts "do you think we'll have time?"

       I have always thought that patience was a virtue. Now I'm starting to think it's a curse. at the moment I'm a HighSchool football coach and my patience is wearing thin. Each day i tell these young men what to do and how to do it, but you would think i was i giving them advice on a horse at a derby race. So far I love my job. Maybe for the shear idea that from time to time some one listens to me and thinks I'm right and they recognize that. In my history class they take my word as gospell. Thats probably since i make the test. Out on the practice field the other team dictates if i did a good job or not.
