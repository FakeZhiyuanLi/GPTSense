      well, the first night on my new job was great.  pretty busy, but the other girls said it wasn't busy compared to what tonight will be.  i guess i'll find out in a couple of hours.  my knee hurts, though.  i think i hyper-extended it in yoga the other night and all the walking last night must have irritated it more.  being the hiker that i am, you wouldn't think i could hyper-extend my knee, but i guess i can.  i'm pretty sure anyone can.  i think it will be okay, it's just a little tender.  i know that i need better shoes for one thing.  i can't wear tennis shoes at my restaraunt job and all the non-tennis shoes i have are not made for extended periods of time on my feet.  hopefully next week i can get some more supportive shoes.  anyways, i've got to get busy cleaning the office b/c i'm off to mom's for the weekend.  hoping to find some solace and relaxation on the lake and in the country.  i'll be back on tuesday, so don't expect an update until then.  have a good weekend.  peace & love.

      okay.  i'm starting this thing all over again.  when you haven't written anything for two months, there's no way to catch up.  i figured i may as well just start from today and go from there.  i put up a picture of me and my dog dylan.  it's not a new picture and it's not the most attractive picture of either one of us, but it's the only one i have of us right now.  it's from last year on day two, "the jorney home", of our big backpacking adventure.  my friend marci, the dog and i all went on a five mile hike into the middle of the ozark national forest.  we were on the ozark highland trail and it was so beautiful!  five miles was a lot at that time because neither one of us had been on an overnight backpacking trip before.  since then i have not been on any more overnight journeys, but i have been on many day trips from four to six miles.  i haven't had much time for hiking lately.  i have been busy in the pits of depression.  thankfully i am over that now and am a better person for the time i spent in that ugly place.  it wasn't fun, but it was necessary for me to move on with my life.  i'm sure you can all relate.  now i have dedicated my weekends to working.  yes, more working.  i already have an mon thru fri, 8 to 5 job and two cleaning jobs (each one day a week), but that still does not support my overspending habits.  i have now destroyed my credit cards and have taken on another job to pay the price for bad money management.  i am going to be a hostess at a local fancy restraunt on thurs, fri and sat nights.  so much for fun on the weekends.  but it will be worth it to be debt free.  also, my most recent passion is moving.  where you say?  to montana?  what's in montana?  that is the most common response my friends give me when i tell them my plans.  i don't know what's there, but i would like to find out.  i have always wanted to live there and i am thinking of finishing college.  i may pursue a degree in forestry or wildlife biology or something of that nature.  who knows.  i won't be able to move until i pay off some bills and have enough cash to move on.  most of you (family & friends) already know all of this stuff, but i had to start somewhere.  well, i guess this is all i have to say for today.  i will leave you all with a poem, it's one of my favorites.  i'll check in tomorrow and let you know how my new job went.  peace out, jonelle.   reflections in a mocha:  i ate the whipped cream first  chocolate covered people drinking water flavored coffee over vanilla conversations of war  & loyalty my eyes lined dark with  hopelessness so you don't forget to look there  first  stained-glass lies on bright flashing screens punk down the ways i feel so lost and empty lips numb from nicotine the consequences of trying not to think i show more skin so no one tries to  see inside   jpd 2-16-04

      well, it's friday.  nothing happening this weekend.  i really like this blog because i'm the only one that reads it.  i guess i'm not interesting enough for anyone to care about, and that's pretty cool.  i could actually say whatever about whoever and nobody would ever know.  hmmm, that gives me some ideas.  well, it's hot, humid and sunny today.  yuck!  i guess summer is actually here.  it could have stayed wherever it was for all i care.  i prefer the other three seasons.  my favorites are late fall and early spring.  cool weather and no bugs.  the mosquitos are like satan spawn here and i'm their favorite treat.  with that horrible west nile virus i kind of worry, but i found some pretty good bug spray that keeps them away for a while.  its from avon believe it or not.  it's their skin-so-soft expedition bug spray.  it's in a green can and it's deet free.  it is also very reasonably priced.    i really do see why no one reads this crap.  just mindless, uninteresting stuff.  i really am more interesting than this.  i often find myself trying to read other people's blogs and sometimes they just suck.  but here i am more boring than any blog i've ever read.  i am a good poet though.  maybe i should just stick to posting poetry.  pick a poem to explain how i'm feeling that day, a haiku maybe.  it would be a neat experiment.  i've got to get some pictures developed.  i have 5 rolls of film at home on my coffee table that i haven't developed b/c i waste my money and am poor.  i'll get my tip share at work tonight from last week so maybe i'll go develop my film tomorrow.  okay, so i'll write a haiku real quick then ease on down the road.  peace out everyone.   one friday in june  exaggerated days roll over stones thrown by someone else's god   jpd

      it's humid and gray here in arkansas today.  it rained a lot last night.  all of my vegetables are going to rot if we don't see some good sunshine soon.  my tomatoes are doing well, but my squash have blossom-end rot which is caused from too much water.  it is partially my fault because i was under the impression that i needed to water every day.  wrong.  i thought since i had planted in containers that they would need to be watered often, but they do not need water every day.  and it's been raining so much here that i probably could get away with not watering at all.  it's been raining at least one day a week for the last couple of months.  anyways, i went and had dinner with my friend last night at a local mexican restaraunt, senior tequila.  it's the best mexican food i've ever had!  anyways, she showed up 45 minutes late which is fine b/c she has a little baby and i just figured she got behind, but while sitting there waiting i almost cried because i wanted a happy hour margarita (2.75 as opposed to 5.75) and it was 6:59 and no one would wait on me, and i kept thinking about how bad it sucked to be sitting in a restaraunt alone waiting on someone you didn't know was coming or not and i have pms.  i was trying to decide if i was mad or not and then she showed up.  of course i can't be mad at marci, she's the best, and she had a good excuse:  she went to the other senior tequila.  haha, it was kind of funny.  the whole thing wouldn't have happened if i had not forgotten my phone at home earlier that day.  then she could have called me and told me what was up.  well when she got there i started quizzing her about her religion.  when we met a couple of years ago, neither one of us was anything but a drunk, so we never really discussed religion.  now marci has become a mother and she feels that she's not living for herself any more.  she feels that she was selfish before and now must focus on raising her son the best way she knows how.  she is a christian now and says she could never have made it through the pregnancy without god.  i don't know.  there are some things i just don't want to go back to.  a good christian would say that all of these thoughts are just satan tricking me, pulling the wool over my eyes so i can no longer see the truth.  i don't know what i believe.  marci is reading a book called the purpose driven life.  i think i'll check it out after she's done.  i'm willing to read anything until i can figure all of this out.  well, i'm off to lunch now so i'll write more later if i get a chance.  peace out.

      what is religion all about and why are we looked down on if we are not a member of a popular one?  i saw a church bilboard the other day and it had this message on it:  "the problem with self-made people is that they often worship their maker".  damn right!  i'm proud of all the things i have accomplished on my own, but i don't see myself as the queen of the world.  i don't see what's wrong with being happy that i am a self-confident, self-sufficient woman who has the ability to make smart decisions.  why do i want to be a part of something that tells me i don't have what it takes to think or make a decision on my own?  in the religion i used to belong to you didn't do anything without first consulting god and waiting for him to give you an answer.  i have found that the answer will come anyways if you are patient and looking for the signs.  i have also found that i can do as well as god in solving my problems.  i think according to christianity this may be a blasphemous thing to say, but i am not denying the existence or power of god, i just believe in myself.  life won't always be the same and i won't always be the same, but now that i know this i will be able to roll with the tide.  i spent a long time trying to get it all together so i could have a life when i've been immersed in the best parts of life all along.  i savor the good with the bad.  sorry for all the rambling, but this is a subject that won't leave me alone lately.  i won't be able to rest until i've found a "religion" to call my own.  i think i lean more toward buddhism than christianity, but i really have a hard time putting a person up on a pedastel as my "leader".  after all, jesus was just a man.  right?

      hi!  i'm back from my long weekend.  it was so nice and relaxing.  i got to see my new-born cousin and i spent a day out on the lake and then i got my hair cut.  fun times.  i got a little sunburnt sunday while we were on the lake, but not too bad.  we fished, but didn't catch anything.  they just weren't biting.  my new job is super easy, but i do a lot of walking!  i wore my pedometer to work friday night and from 4:30 to 11:00 i walked 4.32 miles!  impressive if you ask me!  now i did a lot more walking than the other girls.  they don't mind standing around, but i don't like it.  i prefer to be doing something useful.  they are all teenagers except for me and one other girl who's 23.  one 16, one 17 and one 19.  the 17 year old is actually pretty cool.  she's pretty mature for her age and has been there the longest.  she knows everything about hostessing and i'm sticking with her so i can figure it all out.  if you just stand around and wait on someone to show you what to do, no one ever will.  anyways, i enjoy the job.  the hours are good and the people are nice, even if they are a little immature.  i haven't really spoken to any of the servers yet.  i don't feel like i have anything to say.  i'm sure we'll get around to introducing ourselves at some point.  it doesn't really matter though becaus i'm not there to make new friends, i'm there to make money.  i don't mind making a few new aquaintences though.  well, this is all for the moment.  i'll write more this afternoon is i find anything interesting to write about.  later.

      i'm so dang tired i can't even see straight.  it's like i'm viewing everything through a haze.  i had to work late last night because we were very busy at the restaurant.  we were on a waiting list until 10:00 last night and i ended up working until 10:30.  then of course i was out of gas and had to fill up my tank, then i was hungry so when i got home i had to scrounge up something to eat.  then it took me a little while to fall asleep because i was so wound up.  when i pulled up in the driveway and got out of the car, i could hear dylan howling in the back yard.  i think she was sad and thought i was never coming home.  i hadn't seen her since 7:40 yesterday morning and she was worried about me i guess.  she was so happy to see me last night.  she's still adjusting to me having a second job also.  it's hard on her because she is a spoiled doggy and hates hanging out alone.  she prefers to be either in the house in the air conditioning or out hiking somewhere.  actually, it really doesn't matter what she's doing as long as she's with me.  i love my dog!  i have an awesome picture that i took a while back of her that i'll scan and put up here next week.  anyways, i'm off to run an errand.  i'll try to think of something cool to write about for later.  peace.

      besides therapy, i really need a good name for my blog.  i've had several things up there, but i didn't like any of them.  they were okay for a minute, but not permanantly.  if you have a good suggestion, email me and i'll consider it.  no dirty stuff though because my family reads this.  well, supposedly they do.  anyways, not much time to write today.  got to head off to my second job here in a few.  talk to ya later.

      "good-bye ruby tuesday, who could hang a name on you? when you change with every new day, still i'm gonna miss you...."  the rolling stones rock!  the other song i love by them is paint it black.  don't know why i had that song in my head, maybe because it's tuesay.  do you ever get that enlightened feeling?  you know, like you really know that you're thinking straight and are on a path that leads to exciting places but you're scared to death because you've never had a goal before?  that's how i feel today.  clear headed and hopeful for the future.  in making and sharing my plans to move to montana with family and friends, i have received nothing but 100% support from everyone.  no one has been surprised and most can't believe i've waited until now to do something like this.  it's uplifting to know that i will still have the support of the people i love no matter where i will be.  thanks you guys!  it really makes a difference.   anyways, enough with the sappy stuff.  so i actually accomplished my yard work yesterday and got to have an enjoyable evening hanging out with some friends.  well, i'm off to my tuesday night house cleaning job so i'll write more tomorrow.  bye.  j.

      man am i tired!  this working two jobs thing is kicking my ass!  i'm hoping that i will adjust after another couple of weeks.  i guess i'm just getting old.  i did get to hang out with my little bro this weekend, so that was cool.  other than that, i was completely useless.  oh, well, i'll adjust.  so i watched a totally sick and twisted movie last night.  it's called monster with charlize theron.  dude, if i were her i'd be doing the same damn thing!  although towards the end, she did sorta freak out and shouldn't have killed the last couple of guys.  i think that's why she got caught.  it's just so messed up that we treat people the way we do.  everyone deserves love and respect.  you can't always control your current circumstances, but as long as you're trying it shouldn't matter what's happening on the outside.  we're just not taught to care about other people anymore.  we learn to protecte ourselves at an early age because we're picked on or beaten or whatever.  it does make a difference, everyone needs a break and everyone needs to know that they are not worthless just because they're not multi-millionaires or movie stars or presidents or white-american-christians.  okay, enough of the rant, but ignorance, racisim and hate really bother me.  and we claim to be educated.  please, what a joke.  okay, really, i'll quit now because i'm going home.  i need to work in the yard, but i don't know how far i'll get.  well, i'll see ya'll tomorrow.

      man, i had this whole thing typed out and had to do some work and when i came back to finish it and publish it, everything i had written was gone.  oh well, i guess i wasn't supposed to share that information with the general public, family and friends.  it was kind of interesting yet embarrassing at the same time.    well, i read a really cool book last night.  it was called "for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf".  it is a choreopoem.  i didn't know what a choreopoem was either, but it is a grouping of poems (20 in this one) put together and acted out as if it's a play.  the author is a lady named ntozake shange and it was written in 1974.  i recommend it to everyone.  women and men alike.  men may not understand it as well, but then again, this may shed some light on the mysteries of womanhood.  the poems are all written from different stages of life from teenager to traumatic adult experiences all from the perspective of a black girl.  it's really great because even i could identify with some of the things she was talking about.  makes you see just how similar we all are no matter what color we may be.    i'm finally gaining acknowledgement as a person at my new job.  it always takes a while and i'm not one to go around introducing myself to everyone.  sometimes people just aren't in the mood to talk, so i wait for them to come to me.  one of the other hostesses (also 19 y/o) and i were talking on saturday night.  she stopped the conversation and asked me if my tongue was pierced.  i said yes and she said "i never would have guessed that about you."  i replied "now liz, looks can be deceiving."  she said she new and we proceeded to have a lengthy and enlightening conversation.  basic stuff, just getting to know each other.  i though it was really cool, but i guess everyone there probably has the same impression of me as liz did.  i'm not exactly sure what her perception of me was, but i'm guessing she thought i was a straight-edge.  it's funny how we come to conclusions about people.  i try really hard to reserve judgment of someone until i've gotten to know them a little bit.  now i do judge based on actions.  maybe i shouldn't, but sometimes you just know how someone is strictly because of how they talk, act or treat others.  i guess that's wrong too because they could always be putting on a show or just hiding their real self from others.  i see no need to hide myself.  i want to wear a t-shirt sometimes that says "yeah, that's right, this is me."  know what i mean?  just so people know that i'm for real and i'm not hiding anything for any reason.  i'm not afraid of what they think of me, i'm proud of who i am.  it just sucks that other people are not so open and don't care to get to know someone based entirely on the way they look.  well, i guess that's a good enough rant for today.  i'm gonna go have dinner with my friend so i'm going to hit the road.  have a nice evening!  peace.

      surely we must have set some sort of record for the most rainfall in june ever in the history of arkansas.  i'm starting to feel a little gloomy myself.  i need some sunshine!  it's supposed to be decent on sunday, so maybe the sun will show itself.    so get this.  i'm a recent ani di franco fan.  a good friend of mine turned me on to her newest album, educated guesses.  it was perfect for that moment in my life, you know how that works sometimes.  anyways, i was checking out ani's website today just to see if she was going to be on tour anywhere close anytime soon.  well, she's going to be in eureka springs in september!  i had to do a double take b/c i was sure that it was a misprint, but i called the phone number and it was legit.  i'm excited about it.  ani rocks!    well, i'm getting out of here early and have monday off also so i guess i'll write more on tuesday.  hopefully i'll have something good to write about and hopefully i won't float away in this rainstorm.  later.

      well, i guess i'm not up to par with the writing every day thing.  i have never been able to keep a journal either.  i just can't do it.  don't know why.  well, there's been a little going on lately.  it has rained and rained and rained here!  so far, every day this week.  the only day that weather.com says it might not rain is on sunday which is good b/c i have a family reunion that day.  hmmm, lets see, what else.  i've been throwing/giving stuff away out of my house.  it is so cluttered and full of crap that i can't stand it any more.  i'm losing it.  i have no storage space and there is stuff piled everywhere.  i've gotten rid of furniture, clothes, shoes, books, trash, food and basically anything i don't absolutely have to keep to survive this mean mean world.  i have several more furniture items to get rid of this weekend.  my bro will be here with his truck and i plan on employing it to my use.  i'm sure you're wondering why i'm getting rid of furniture.  the reason is that i have no space.  i have stuff around the entire perimeter of my living room.  i want to rearrange and i can't because all i can do is put stuff back where it was when i first moved in.  i've been in a complete circle and there is no where left to move stuff.  it's bad living in a little one bedroom house with no closets.  you can't switch things out, you are stuck looking at everything all the time.  so i'll remedy the problem by getting rid of the things i don't absolutely need.  doesn't that make perfect sense.  what's going to happen is that i will get rid of something i do need and then i'll be pissed!  i have it all planned out though, so i'll let you know how it all ends up.    the most fun i've had lately is when me and the dog went hiking on saturday.  the weather was really nice and it wasn't raining so it was a very pleasant hike.  that's another thing that's been going on.  my dog dylan has been super needy lately.  i think it's because of my extra job.  me working at hours that i used to spend hanging out with her.  she's at home in the house right now, probably howling and barking and scratching the door waiting for me to get home.  she's crazy.  she loves being in the house, but only with me.  she hates being anywhere by herself.  the reason she's in the house is because when i was leaving home after lunch, she jumped up and put her little paws up on the fence and started whining "mommmaaaaa!!!  don't leave me here!  please, please please!  come back!"  she was not happy that i was going back to work.  the last time she ran away, she exhibited this exact behavior so i was a little worried.  i came back to work for an hour and a half then went back home and let her in.  at least this way i know she won't end up in the pound or lost or dead.  tonight i have to repair the electric fencing so she can't escape.  it shouldn't take long, just some new wire, trimming some bushes, plugging it in and crossing my fingers that it still works.  i'll let you know.  well, i've got to get out of here and rescue my poor sad mistreated (read:  SPOILED!!!) sweet adorable doggy from the unspeakable horrors of the air conditioned house.  peace out.

      well, i really had nothing to say today except crap.  i was just going to gripe about people who aren't like me and that actually goes against what i believe in.  everybody doesn't have to be the same and who am i to say that i'm better than the sixty year old woman with fake boobs and an airbrushed tan?  it's something i could gripe about for a while, but i don't want to be that way.  it's a free country and you are free to look and act however you want as long as it isn't hurtful to others.  those boobs weren't hurting me (well, maybe my eyes) so i guess i'll just let them be.    don't you hate it when you have to check yourself before you turn into an ass like "the others"?  takes you down a peg or two.  i try to regard myself highly because i'm nice and open-minded.  you wouldn't think it, but one of my biggest problems is judging others based on looks.  i'm about as far from being a racist as anyone can get, so i'm not talking about judgement based on color here.  i'm talking about judgement based strictly on how someone portrays themselves with clothes, make-up, hair, etc.  i guess i've just worked so hard to figure out who i am and how to portray myself truthfully that i feel above others in some way.  i know that i'm really who i say i am and sometimes i just look at people and laugh because i think they're trying too hard to be something they're not.  but how do i know that?  maybe that's really them and maybe they've worked just as hard as i have to reach that point in their lives.  i shouldn't judge anyone until i've at least spoken to them and know a little bit about them.  but i guess they could always be lying to me.  oh, well, it's a hopeless situation.  basically just don't judge others unless you want to be judged by them.  looks don't mean anything and everything is not as it seems.  what goes around comes around.  well, i've just learned a good life lesson so i'm gonna go to my other job and try to spread some good karma tonight.  i suggest you all do the same because it's important.  really, it is.  peace everybody.  love, jonelle.

      well, my holiday was nice, how about yours?  i had lunch with the fam for my grandmas birthday and then we had a family reunion.  it was cool, but the weather sure was hot!  i usually enjoy the gatherings of family, eating and chatting.  nothing deep and personal, just the surface stuff.  my whole family now knows that i'm planning on moving to montana, and most of them say to just go now.  i would if i had the money.  that's the point of waiting.  anyways, i've spent my free time today surfing the web looking at tattoos.  my little bro has employed me to draw him a half sleeve.  i'm honored and humbled at the same time.  tattoo artistry is tough.  i've done a couple of sketches, but i can't quite get it right.  i haven't actually spent loads of time on it (like i have loads of time), but i need to put in a couple of hours just brainstorming.  he sent me to a website that has some things he likes just so i can get an idea of what he's looking for.  i actually have a really cool idea, but it's just not there yet.  maybe after he actually gets the tat i'll put a picture up on here so everyone can see it.  maybe i'll jump-start a career as a tattoo artist.  i don't think i actually want to put tattoos on people (i just don't want to touch the places where some people want tattoos, know what i mean?) but i wouldn't mind actually drawing tattoos.  so it's back to being hot and nasty this summer.  last week was actually very nice for june weather.  most days it wasn't above 80.  but then again, it did rain a lot last week.  not so lucky now.  i guess i'll just have to sweat until october.  yuck!  you don't want to do anything but sit in the air-conditioning.  yard work is for the birds and hiking is out of the question unless you want to have a heat stroke.  late evening walks are okay, but i just can't handle the full on heat and humidity.  maybe i'm just a wuss.  i did have a heat stroke out hiking last summer and ever since then, i've not been the same.  i can't handle the heat without getting sick.  my friend shelly and i were out hiking a trail we had never been on before.  we were both in really good shape so we didn't expect to have any trouble.  well, little did we know that the woods surrounding the trail we were hiking had been in a forest fire 3 years before and 3/4 of the trees were no longer in existence.  therefore 3 of the 4.5 miles we hiked had no tree cover and it was the hottest day of the year.  the heat index was 110 and it really got to me.  i couldn't hike more than 10 minutes without getting dizzy and having to sit down and i threw-up towards the end of the trail.  we eventually made it back to the car.  once in the a/c i still couldn't drink anything without being ill.  it's wierd when you heat stroke.  you puke up all your liquids and then the only thing that makes sense is to replace them, right?  well, it's impossible.  no matter how small the sips i took or what i drank (i tried water and gatorade) it made me sick again.  my head was killing me and i was dizzy and i kept nodding off.  i'm suprised i didn't have to go to the hospital.  another mile on that trail and shelly would have had to call an ambulance.  her dog even did better than i did.  i was so embarassed and felt so defeated.  i was in the best shape ever and a little 4.5 mile trail had kicked my ass.  well, we went back last winter and conquered the trail:  4.5 miles in 1.5 hours!  woohoo!  we were so proud, me especially!  now when it's hot outside i just have to take it easy and hike in shaded areas in the morning or evening.  word of wisdom from someone not so wise:  never hike a treeless trail in the summertime!    well, that's my not so exciting story.  hope everyone is staying cool.  i'm off to my yoga class so i'll talk to everyone again later this week.  i'll leave you with a poem in honor of summer.  peace out.  some things never change  sticky heat rolls  down my bare skin pooling onto the seat of the metal folding chair my legs are  stuck to    jpd 7-7-04

      well, i guess i'm off to my second job and then to party down with my friends.&nbsp; i'm kind of hoping we're not too busy tonight b/c that means i'll get off a little early.&nbsp; i'm aiming for 9:30.&nbsp; that's decent.&nbsp; i guess i'll talk to you again next week.&nbsp; have a nice weekend!&nbsp; peace.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  last call  &nbsp;  bright lights&nbsp;cut through the  shadow of last night.&nbsp; empty eyes drinking it in  &nbsp;  jpd 7-16-04

      well, i've set a date for moving.&nbsp; my current goal is to be out of arkansas by october 31st.&nbsp; i think that's pretty reasonable.&nbsp; hopefully i'll have enough money to get there by then.&nbsp; i'm actually planning on flying up to missoula sometime in october to do the job interview/house renting thing.&nbsp; i'm going to start applying for jobs in september and hopefully by the time my plane leaves i'll have a couple of interviews lined up.&nbsp; i don't know, though.&nbsp; i might just load up and go.&nbsp; i guess it depends on how close i can get to having a job without actually being in montana.&nbsp; who knows!&nbsp; it's kind of fun right now because i'm making all sorts of plans, but i can't actually do anything until it's closer to moving time.&nbsp; i've been cleaning out my house for the last couple of months, i guess in preparation for moving.&nbsp; i don't know really, it just started driving me crazy and i just started giving stuff away.&nbsp; i'm going to continue on that path until i'm down to the bare necessities, or whatever i can fit in my car when i move.&nbsp;  &nbsp; okay, enough of that.&nbsp; lets talk about the present.&nbsp; i'm going out for my friends tonight for girls night out.&nbsp; fun times!&nbsp; i'm excited.&nbsp; we only do this once every six months or so because everyone has kids and husbands.&nbsp; yuck!&nbsp; kidding, i'm just not to that place yet.&nbsp; anyways, it's rare that we can all get together at once for a night of blowing off steam.&nbsp; only four of us are getting to go tonight, but four is better than none.&nbsp; well, i may actually have to do some work for a little while so i'll try to write more later this afternoon.&nbsp; hopefully, for your sake,&nbsp;it will be more interesting than this but we&nbsp;may not be so lucky.&nbsp; talk to ya later.&nbsp; jpd.&nbsp;

      well, it looks like i'm going to be moving soon.  yep, i know, it's really scary.  the more i've thought about it, the more i have realized that i gave myself a super comfortable time period in which to be moved.  actually, in march i said a year and now it's july and i've been telling people a year.  what's happening is that i'm saying a year from whenever so that the time never actually arrives.  smart, huh, for someone who doesn't actually want to move.  and for those who haven't heard, i went to the dentist yesterday b/c my tooth has been hurting and it seems i have a cracked tooth and will have to pay $700 to get a crown put on it.  crappy!  i was depressed all day long yesterday.  it seems like such a setback in my moving plan b/c $700 could do a lot.  but then again, if i wait around a year there's no telling what else will pop up that will take my hard-earned, montana-designated money away from me.  i may as well just get as much moolah as i can in my "montana jar" within the next 3 or 4 months and then just hit the road.  makes sense to me.  i don't think i'll ever be completely ready as far as money goes, and the longer i wait, the more i become one of those people who does a lot of talking but never follows through.  now i'm not saying that just because i've said i want to do something and that means i can't change my mind b/c that's not true, but when it gets right down to it if montana is something i want to do then i need to just go ahead and do it.  if i'm planning on going to school up there, i have to live there for a year anyways so i can qualify for in-state tuition (which will save me $4000 dollars a semester!!!) so i may as well be working two jobs up there and paying off the same bills while establishing myself as a resident.  it only makes sense.  i guess i'm just afraid to actually do it.  i haven't thought of it as being close enough to worry about what i will do when the time comes to move.  but i know that montana is where i need to go.  i don't know what i'll find there and i know it's terribly far away from everyone i love, but it's something i have to do.  even if i only find out that it's not right, i still have to do it.  something good will come out of all of this if it's only a life lesson so i guess i'm ready to go.  i can see myself now crying all the way to montana with dylan in the back seat hanging her head out of the window breathing the last of the arkansas air we'll breathe for a while.  i'll be on the phone with everyone telling them i miss them already and when are you gonna come see me, please come soon.  well, i'm going to get on the web and check out the missoula classifieds and see if there's any jobs or houses with my name on them.  i'll keep ya'll posted.  love ya, jonelle.

      damn, i just spent 20 minutes writing this really great entry only to hit the back button after previewing (thinking i was going back to edit) and deleting the whole freakin' thing!&nbsp; it almost seems ridiculous to rewrite what i just wrote.&nbsp; it doesn't seem as cool.&nbsp; oh well.  so my friend carissa told me to check out one of her friends' blogs so i did.&nbsp; it was great!&nbsp; i just love reading other people's blogs.&nbsp; it's funny b/c i told all my friends to go read mine and a couple of them have started their own so it's turning into one giant blog circle.&nbsp; fun times!&nbsp; anyways, on the other blog i was reading, she had this huge long rant about britney spears and her recent engagement, which i think is b.s.,&nbsp;and my friend shelly and&nbsp;i have&nbsp;recently come up with theory about this&nbsp;subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;first let me get the basics straight.&nbsp; britney is engaged to one of her dancers who has an ex and a kid and another on the way, right?&nbsp; well, that just starts off crazy!&nbsp; so how are they going to tell us that dude's pregnant ex is just thrilled that he's now engaged to britney s. and she is left with two kids?&nbsp; yeah right!&nbsp; i know women, and that just ain't how it goes down.&nbsp; anyways, so here's the theory:&nbsp; britney has a one-night-stand with one of her dancers (like that's never happened before?), ends up pregnant, dude's woman is pissed b/c they have a kid together so britney cancels the tour (knee surgery?&nbsp; yeah right!), drops out of sight, pays dude's woman to say that she's his ex, she's pregnant again&nbsp;and she's happy for him (again, yeah right!)&nbsp;and then after britney gives birth, the dancer's "ex" will raise the child as her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;and she'll be a multi-millionaire.&nbsp; now that's a conspiracy for you!&nbsp; sounds like she could run the country!&nbsp; that's a lot of covering up just so nobody finds out your dirty little secret.&nbsp; i'm telling you, she's a politician in the making.  okay, enough crap for today.&nbsp; i guess i'll leave ya'll alone.&nbsp; peace everyone!&nbsp; jpd.

      well, my little bro hooked it up with a title for my blog.&nbsp; he sent me an email saying this:&nbsp;"you are living life on the fringe trying to do something that you may have never thought possible and for some reason i thought of a carpetbagger."&nbsp; i think it's perfect and wonderful!&nbsp; dan, you rule!&nbsp; anyways, it's just been lovely here lately.&nbsp; not sure why, but i sure deserve it.&nbsp; i got a rough start off to the new year back in january and have been struggling ever since.&nbsp; just emotional crap and boy troubles.&nbsp; but when you get involved with a guy, there's bound to be trouble not far behind.&nbsp; unless he's "the one" (which i have thankfully not had the honor of coming across yet, and i say this b/c i'm soooooo not ready to meet him!), then it's just crap waiting to happen.&nbsp; i don't think it has to be crappy, but people are just not&nbsp;down&nbsp;with complete honesty&nbsp;or being up front about their feelings.&nbsp; seems like someone is always trying to make it happen when deep down they know it won't.&nbsp; they don't care because they'd rather be miserable with someone than just plain alone.&nbsp; not me.&nbsp; i'd rather be alone if it's going to suck.&nbsp; i don't&nbsp;need one more failed relationship under my belt.&nbsp; i guess there are times when you learn important things from relationships.&nbsp; like what you don't want.&nbsp; that's important to know, though.&nbsp; okay, i have no clue why i'm blabbing on about relationships.&nbsp; next subject.  &nbsp;  i finally figured out how to get a picture on my profile.&nbsp; i was pumped up about it.&nbsp; i really like the picture.&nbsp; i'm usually not very photogenic and have one eye half closed or it looks like i'm growling or something really wierd like that.&nbsp; this pic my friend marci took of me &amp; her baby.&nbsp; i have a little photo software (nothing special) so i cropped, made it black &amp; white and it turned out great!&nbsp; i had actually just finished hiking, so maybe that's why i look so content.&nbsp; who knows, but it's the best pic of myself that i have right now.&nbsp; well, i guess that's all for now.&nbsp; i'll write more in the next couple of days.&nbsp; hope everyone is well and i'll see ya later.&nbsp; love, jonelle.

       the first thing that pops into your mind is that these two things do  not  go together, right?&nbsp; well at little rock's (apparantly) hottest bar they do.&nbsp; the electric cowboy is the place to be after midnight on a friday night.&nbsp; there was a line out the door.&nbsp; crazy.&nbsp; four huge bars, one&nbsp;in every corner of the open, warehouse-like space.&nbsp; thin, cheap carpet over concrete floors.&nbsp; can't imagine how nasty they are when the lights are on.&nbsp; a dance floor in the center of the room with&nbsp;bar-like table top all the way around the perimeter and bar stools lining the tables.&nbsp; i have never seen so many beer bottles and drinks piled up in my life!&nbsp; apparantly you are not allowed to have drinks on the dance floor and they do not have waitresses to clean the mess up.&nbsp; i wonder how many people actually pick the correct drink back up.&nbsp; it probably doesn't matter.&nbsp; anyways, they play about 15 minutes of country and then 15 minutes of rap/hip-hop/booty shakin' music.&nbsp; while they're playing country, everyone line dances.&nbsp; i do mean everyone.&nbsp; when they switch to hip-hop, they usually keep line dancing for the first song or two then switch to the bump and grind.&nbsp; it's scary!&nbsp; you've got the cowboys shaking it next to the gangsters and the gangsters line dancing next to the cowboys.&nbsp; it's a sight to see!&nbsp; i suggest everyone go at least once just for the show.&nbsp; it was fun because i was with my girlfriends and we all look out for each other.&nbsp; i would  never  go alone, even if it was to meet up with a friend.&nbsp; i don't know about ever going again.&nbsp; it was a little fun, just for the people watching, but the guys are drunk and nasty and will just walk up to you and get all in your face without caring if you want them to or not.&nbsp; i guess good, interesting fun for a group.  hmmmm, let's see, what else.&nbsp; i think i have another cracked tooth.&nbsp; it's very depressing to think about it.&nbsp; i hate that i'll be working two jobs for the next 3.5 months just to pay for two new teeth.&nbsp; i don't know that i'll be able to move in october or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;i want to, but it seems that things keep coming up.&nbsp; i spoke with my friend janet last night and she's having a baby in november.&nbsp; i was there for her last one and she wants me to be there for this one too.&nbsp; it seems that i am a highly sought after birth coach.&nbsp; who knew?&nbsp; anyways, i hate to haul off to montana when i could be there with her for the baby, but if i wait for that then there will be someone else who needs something else from me.&nbsp; i'm not saying anything bad about janet, i would absolutely love to hang around and meet the new baby, but i don't know.&nbsp; so back to the tooth thing, why in the hell are my teeth cracking?&nbsp; i take my vitamins and i eat lots of fruit and veggies, so what gives?&nbsp; all i can figure is that i'm either clenching or grinding my teeth in my sleep and it's causing my teeth to break.&nbsp; is that possible?&nbsp; i've been dealing with a minor case of tmj for the last couple of months, but the dentist figured it's just clenching, not the grinding.&nbsp; but surely just gritting my teeth wouldn't cause them to crack, would it?&nbsp; it's just a little odd to me.&nbsp; something's not right, i think i'll go talk to my herb lady.&nbsp; well, i guess that's all i have to say for now so i'll talk to everyone later.&nbsp; give peace a chance.&nbsp; jonelle.

      i'm feeling a little edgy today.&nbsp; first of all, i'm supposed to have a date tonight, but he hasn't bothered to call and confirm yet and it's already 3:00.&nbsp; what's up with that?&nbsp; i thought for sure he would call last night but he didn't.&nbsp; i'm really not sure what to do.&nbsp; i could call him, but i don't know if i really want to go&nbsp;so&nbsp;i'm going&nbsp;to be childish and leave it up to him.&nbsp; this way if he doesn't call i'll have a reason not to see him any more.&nbsp; if he does then i'll have to decide for myself.&nbsp; damn!&nbsp;   second on my list, my good friend is having lots of life drama.&nbsp; it happens all the time to everyone, but it seems like anything that could go wrong for her has gone wrong this week.&nbsp; i love her and just want her to be happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;it just sucks for her, that's all.&nbsp; life is hard sometimes and it sucks.&nbsp; &nbsp;  anyways, this particular friend and i were having a discussion not so long ago about how we sometimes sabatoge ourselves.&nbsp; ever done that?&nbsp; i know i have.&nbsp; you've decided you want to do something but you haven't yet followed through and somewhere inbetween saying and doing you get stuck in a completely different situation and never get to do what you said you wanted to.&nbsp; it just seems to me like when things like that happen, we may not really want to do that thing we said we wanted to do.&nbsp; if you're willing to let something get in your way when you know it's not smart, then maybe you're actually looking for a way out.&nbsp; does that make any sense?&nbsp; i think so.&nbsp; but i think it's that way all through life.&nbsp; just like me and my date tonight.&nbsp; i'm looking for the easy way out myself.&nbsp; i don't want to hurt his feelings by telling him i don't want to see him anymore, but i really don't even know if he has those kind of feelings for me.&nbsp; we haven't really talked about it.&nbsp; it's actually very complicated and i don't want to get into it on here.&nbsp; basically, i'm looking for the easy way out which is a charactaristic i don't particulary like to have.&nbsp; i am always&nbsp;telling people to&nbsp;speak your mind, no matter what.&nbsp; &nbsp;quit wasting everyone's time and just say what you feel.&nbsp; it's a lot harder, but it's so much better that way.&nbsp; you are being up front and honest, no games.&nbsp; it takes a lot of guts to be honest these days and in the end you are respected for it.&nbsp;   well, this entry is going nowhere else but down so i guess i'll cut myself off.&nbsp; how about this beautiful weather?&nbsp; it's been low to mid 80's all week long and in the 60's every morning when i leave for work.&nbsp; and it's the end of july!&nbsp; such an awesome treat!&nbsp;   now i'm off to find balance and inner strength in my yoga class!&nbsp; namaste.

      this was me in high school according to a quiz i took on the web.&nbsp; it is a pretty accurate description of the way i was:    urlLink    Take the  urlLink What High SchoolStereotype Are You?  quiz.   everyone should go check it out.&nbsp; it's funny.&nbsp; thankfully i made it out alive&nbsp;and&nbsp;am now on a fast-track to hell.&nbsp; i know, i know, i guess that's not funny to some people.&nbsp; well, got some work to do and then to the dentist.&nbsp; will have something new to whine about tomorrow b/c i'm sure my dentist will have very bad news for me.&nbsp; i am keeping my fingers crossed for the best though.&nbsp; peace is having happy teeth.

      well, i am still alive.  bet you were wondering.  here's a quick rundown of my life since last wednesday:  got bit by a fire ant and my foot swelled up really big (some sort of allergic reaction), got stood up for my date (the show was cancelled but he didn't bother to call and let me know), my other job sucked b/c people were just plain crazy this weekend (apparantly it was a blue moon:  two full moons in one month), i watched the entire lord of the rings trilogy on sunday (i know, i'm a nerd), i have gnats in my house and can't get rid of them (i've tried everything i can think of, so i'm going to fred's to get some fly paper), i think i caught a nasty cold, got a nail in my tire & it went flat and i bought a brand new totally awesome sleeping bag.  so i've been real busy at work and haven't had time to write, but i promise i'll get another chance eventually.  i'm about to go home and nurse myself back to health before i get a chance to get very sick.  i'm going to turn down the a/c (because it's hotter than a skeeter in a bug zapper down here in arkansas), work on my bro's tattoo, bake some zucchini, drink some echinachea tea with lemon, take some vitamin C and veg on some tv.  hopefully i will be cured of this terrible cold in a few days.  i'm actually aiming to fix it before it gets worse.  well, peace everbody!
