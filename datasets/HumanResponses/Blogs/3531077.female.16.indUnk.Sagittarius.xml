         Arm in arm, Hand in hand, We fade against the watercolor horizon, Creating our future.   We never really existed, A vast relief.   Life seemed like a fantasy Inspired by love,  Grateful to know only each other, And to be known by one another. Thankful for the horizon, which we fade into  Pleased to be characters made By the mind of a twisted writer… In a world unfamiliar to us, in a book unfamiliar to anyone.  Smiling sleepily, We sail away floating on intensity, and peace,  Beneath a glassy moon, We set off for a world of our own creation.  For a world of our own escape.

      Moths flicker under the golden radiance of the street lamps. Why does it take so long to get back home from here? There is no reason for me to glance here  And there with greedy smiles, but I do. No sarcastic remarks about me hanging my head out of the car window.  calm and wordless we listen to the songs we should be singing together. Lone lyrics, dance through my head. hardly aware of the buzzing traffic that totally surrounds us. Skipping the cracks and counting each yellow line. 26~27~28.  If the world falls from under me, would you be there to catch me? If I could only understand those silent pauses when you wern't singing along. I wonder what you are thinking. I think the world might be falling now. 30~31~32.

      To kiss your lips, to look into your eyes, Those are the things that I want in my life.  You like the fact that we go so well together. You like how I make you feel. You like being Around someone who is so much like you that it Scares you. You like that fact that I am so open With you about everything.  You know what I love about you? I just love how fun you are to be around. How you make me laugh, and bring tears to my eyes. I love that you treat my like I deserve to be treated, Like a queen of course.  I love you for your eyes, for your every single freckle, For the way you tell me how you feel about the subject Even if you do disagree with Why I care or don’t care about it.   I love the way you smile, your laugh, and your playfulness, and you will always be around no matter what.

      Look into my world See through my eyes If you look close enough you’ll see my disguise.  You can see my into my green eyes and You can hear my cheerful and upbeat voice But can you see deeper?  You only see what I want you to Its only because that’s all I’m Trying to do I’m trying to get you to believe That I am someone that is always happy And that I have no problems  I put on a mask so that you don’t see my sadness And so that you don’t see inside, see all of my pain.  Everyone says ‘she really can’t be sad inside There is nothing there that really seems to be hurting her. She can’t have any worries, She can’t have any, and she’s always around her friends.  I don’t lie I am telling you the truth, I need you to be there for me, through thick and thin. And if you are not you are just like one of them.

      I’m invisible if I do not tell you. You talk to me however it suits you,  Haven’t lied but you are not listening!  I need your affection I didn’t think it would affect me. You are speaking to me without a word ever spoken.    I rely on you to want the right things. And you long for the love that I can give you.  Won’t be long now before I have to leave you, Now that we have solved the initial mystery, Couldn’t we be more?  I’m invisible if I do not tell you. You talk to me however it suits you,  Haven’t lied but you are not listening!

      I trust the red setting sun The leafless November trees. On Monday morning I look forward Fearlessly, to Friday’s eve.  But humans are not reliable like The trees, and nature. I wonder if you will come back, I put my trust only in you

      I recall the gentle courtesy in every move you made. For every song of sadness there is another for happiness That was no ordinary day.  This is love every step of the way, so easy to be close To you so hard to turn away, when all the stars and sentimental Songs dissolving today and all that was left was you.  So I loved you for your courage and your gentle touch. And I love you for your laughter, your language, and your love I knew it wasn’t impossible but I loved you just the same.   I tell you that I love you, even if you are far away, Ill tell you how you have changed me as I live from day to day. You help me to accept myself and I wont forget to say,  Love if never wasted no matter how far you are away.

      Soft kisses fall over your body  Like leaves on a fall day  They fall from whom they love most  With out you I’m no longer whole.  Missing you, soon though the emptiness  Subsides, you return, my heart is whole again.

      Everything around me unraveling like a ball of useless unwanted string.  Nothing is right now, nothing since you told me, I knew it was to good to be true.  When you're gone, things are so dark and dismal.  Unable to cope with this fear and pain, I hide.   I cower in the corner, hiding from you and everyone else.  Behind a mask, a fake smile, pretending to be happy, then no one will know, no one will ask.  It's all just a game, but in the end, when all the unending tears are shed.   I know I never really mattered.   You were just a fragment of sadness in my life.   Just pretend, hide behind my mask I will, because you won't ever see thru me.  You will never know.

      Tears one after another slowly  slipping out and down my rosy cheeks.  Your pulling me apart, Apart at the seams like  a child's play thing. Always curious what's inside.  My tiny threads won't  stand much more before  I break. my feelings always  tossed aside, always forgotten, never important or bold enough to really matter.  I never really mattered  did I to you? Just a  pawn in your game.

      Empty and alone, my fear lurks in the shadows, ready to come out at the most inconvenient and unexpected times. I dreampt of happiness and joy but none ever do become real. None really come true.  rain drops fall like the tears down my face. Slow and many but very distinct, very powerful, very there.  Many days I think about how things could have been  and why they aren't now.  My soul feels hollow you're gone. My heart is unable to heal, slowly drowning in the pain. yet you're not there anymore. You left because of pride and jealousy.  My heart aches and yearns for you, but my dreams never  do become reality.  Why hope for more when hoping gets you nowhere.  pain is growing in my world. My fears are coming. I can see them in the shadows.

      As I slowly walk down the middle of the street, stepping on the yellow faded lines that night.  Thinking to myself about how wrong and hurt I always seem to be. I realize I'm not the only one.  My mind races, pulling out old memoires, so vivid. But my mind is on the slight breeze swirling around me.  Why did you have to react like that?  My lonely tears slide gently down my cheeks. It's not the first time you have brought them.  My tears are so much a part of my fear. Why did you hurt me? My pain is not worth you!  I don't want to be closed tightly in your hands, never to be let go.  I want to be held like a butterfly.  Don't break my frigile wings.  I'll never be able to fly again if you do.  Don't hold me, let me spread my beautiful wings and fly away. soon to come back, but first if you can undo your damaging grip.  Let me fly! Let me be free!

       breathing is somthing that you chose to do to keep surviving. seeing into a world where everyone is breathing, and seeing that everyone is surviving better or happier then yourself... seeing that.. but feeling like you have lost your breath... things that once seemed to dull and lifeless, now light up with a birlliant glow. because of that brilliant radience you are swept away.

      Ok first off.. im sorry i haven't written in a while... Just been busy.. With work and stuff... Recap of what has happened while I've been gone... The air show was AWESOME! You don't know how awesome it was!! VIP PASSES BABY!! and work... i am kinda gettin into this work thing.. i like it but then again.. It takes away my life (or i guess the life i never had)....   one of the guys begged me to take his hours on Wednesday..i told him i had to go to church... But what was i supposed to do (from a girls stand point) when  5 gorgeous guys are standing around you being all nice and begging you to take this guys hours so that he can go to Wisconsin with them. . Its hard... and he's a real meany.. But i took em anyways... He owes me.. Big...   anyways... ummmm today i woke up to one of my friends, Cody, calling me to wake me up.. At 9.. lol... After staying up til about 3.. Its kinda hard to wake up.. But i did... and i talked to him a bit.. Mom called... Told me to mow... i started mowing about 11 after fartin around a while... and well... Again.. i broke the lawnmower.. Its been driven only by me mowing the past 2 times mowed.. and the past two times its been broken too.. i totally bent a blade to the point where it wouldn't even run if the blade was moving... It was bad.. So i didn't mow the other half of my FRONT yard... Anyone up to mowing my yard for me? C`mon any one?... noone reads this anyways... Why even ask...  on to later... Anyways.. i had to babysit the little neighbors for a few hours... Peiton and Gage.. Needless to say.. He went next door to jump on the trampoline, and Peiton went to sleep... (it was about 12:30) and it was freezing in their house.. i swear.. Like it was 40 below....(or 65) but still it was cold!.. Gage came home... and he stood by the sofa for an hour watching  The Fairly Odd Parents ...i swear if were gunna watch cartoons it has to be one i CAN watch.. lol... Anyways... So he's standing there.. and i drifted in and out of consciousness (i was sleeping kinda.) anyways... Peiton wakes up... and we sit there for a while til about 3 when her mom and nanah came home... So i went home....   my mom called me... About 3:20... and told me some bad news... Here goes.. Let me see if i can make it thru tellin you a few things about this without crying... my "uncle" mike (he is a super cowboy.. Its his life.. Remember that)went in and talked to my mom today... He told her that he was on 100% disability for at least 60 days... When he was younger(about 23 years ago) he was in a really bad accident ( i think with his horses or something) anyways... He broke his back.. and they ended up having to put a metal rod in his back... Anyways... He came in and told my mom that the reason he is on disability is that his vertebrate are deteriorating... They are to the point where no doctor will even see him for it... If he had surgery, he would be paralyzed.... He had 9 horses... They were sooo awesome.. Pure breeds.... Champion blood.... He sold all but 2 (the ones that his father gave him).. He had been planning on having his nephew come over to teach him how to ride horses, but they haven't been ridden in sooo long that they are very wild... He is thinking about selling his ranch (which he has lived out there for soooo long!) and moving into town where he can build a duplex for handicap people.. Its hard to think that he is getting himself ready to be in a wheel chair... Gone to walmart was hard for him... He wanted to get groceries, but he couldn't get out of the car, it was to painful for him... He is to proud to ride a scooter thing.... Its really really hard for me to see someone sooo full of life like that... i told my mom that since i worked at price cutters id help him get his groceries, or even get them for him....   my heart just hurts... and i called the first person who came to mind.. Will.. and i tried my best to hold back the tears that i sooo badly wanted to let go...(i don't cry.. it shows weakness.. and i don't like showing im weak) but it didn't work.... it wasn't  real  until i said the words to someone.. Like when my mom told me, it didn't mean as much... But... it did... Then i called Amy, my youth minister, and i tried to tell her what i knew about it, trying to push back the tears... and i had to tell her that i wouldn't be at church on Wednesday... (cuz i had to pick up hours for someone).. Needless to say.. She INSISTED on praying for me.. Which is really cool.. Her and her hubby are...and will.. and who knows who else... But prayer is good, even when the inevitable is at hand... But she also gave me her home number to call her whenever i heard ANYTHING...   but then... i went to work... Put on a smile and tried (for even a few hours) to be happy... Which i was.... and what was cool was when will showed up and said hello.. and brought me some way cool stuff... He bought me... The Everlast CD (IN A BUTTERFLY BOX!){cuz i love butterflies}, a Yankee candle, and a candle holder/dish/thing, a 5$ gift certificate to Yankee candle shop, and this really cool card with my name on it and a verse from the bible.... He doesn't have to get me these things... *hint hint* but he insists... So i guess its cool with me... i cant stop it.. So.. *shrug* what can i do? it was awesome tho.. We got to talk for a while... He made me feel better...   then i went home... and ... Eh? Decided to write down my entire boring day... lol... So.. yea..  Currently listening to: Everlast~ 2 Pieces Of Drama  Hungry for: the candy downstairs on the counter...  what the heck is hard.exe? it came up on my computer as not functioning correctly.. i dunno.. so it ended task  Currently (TRYING TO)learn(ing) on guitar: Jimi Hendrix~ Angel  i need to go to bed... i figured out i walked over 7 miles at work today... eek huh? anyways.. im gunna go to bed...   butterfly kisses! ~Ash       "We must love one another or die."~Wystan Hugh Auden

      last night i was in a rush to get someone to go with me to this conagra picnic thing that they were doin today! So that's why i didn't post last night... Plus the fact that i thought about posting.. But about that time it was 2:30 am, which gave me... around.. 4 hours of sleep before i had to get up to go get the door prizes with my dad... So i was up at 6:30 (totally unwillingly i can tell you that!) and took my shower.. and went with him (still half sleeping) to get the prizes! All i can say is DANG! They treat their people good! Some lucky person today walked away with a HUGE soft side pool, a 27 inch plasma TV, a grill, a bunch of great crap! i bet they spent a good 2000 or 3000 dollars on door prizes ALONE! PLUS the FOOD that they had.. holy crap! Ok to start off with... The amount of people that was there was amazing! They gave away 2000 wrist bands for admission and for food.... i can tell you that there was more then that there.. So food was an issue! They pole cooked pork (8 at that!) they had 2500 hamburgers, 2700 hotdogs/brats, chips, rice, tortillas, baked beans, and potato salad. and they also had booths set up for funnel cakes, these fudge puppies (which were Belgian waffles dipped in chocolate), and kettle corn.... OMG! Was the food excellent! They had softball games, soccer games, little kid games (which i won some cool stuff on. Like a bracelet, a crayon bank, a pen, and a seal doll thinger.., and something else...), they had monad air jumping things... and they had a dunk tank, and and and and they had a rock climbing wall.. That was cool!  i wandered around there from 8 til about 2:30...While i was there i got to talk to one of my dads old trainers for work IN SPANISH! and i guess im actually GETTING the language... Like she seemed VERY impressed, and im not just sayin that... i was really nervous talkin to her tho... im not very good at quick thinking in Spanish.. But i don't talk to Spanish speaking people hardly ever.. So i guess it was a cool thing... and the Latino people that were around the area around us... Seemed very impressed too... i was very.... Happy that they could UNDERSTAND me... They told me that i was pretty good... But i was nervous speaking infront of all those people.. But.. Eh? i guess that's what i need... Anyways we left there, went bought some food from the Mennonites(id hate to be one of those women, you have NO self expression!   I'd Die!   and went home. i got ready to go to another day at work(my dad again told me my clothes were to small, yet if he bought me some THAT FIT ME RIGHT he wouldn't have to say a word)... Went to work.. bs'd people for about 6 hours, and screwed off half of it... lol... By the time i was at work i realized im a stupid person who forgot to put on sunscreen today... So my neck is burnt, and better yet.... Better yet! i was wearing a v-neck shirt so i had a V shaped sunburn on my chest and its on the back of my neck too... :( but yea... Work was awesome.. i got to screw off half of the time.. i got to throw milk and sour cream into the trashcompactor that we have... It was AWESOME... lol... Anyways...  My mom, my dad, and i are gone to the airshow tomorrow.. Its gunna be hella cool! I'll get to tour cool planes, and see them... and...  we have VIP seating, VIP parking, VIP food privileges (free food), we get VIP treatment!   its gunna be cool! I really hope i don't get burnt again... :(.. i prolly will!   current website im on(other then this one..) : http://www.epitonic.com/ (its freakin cool!)  Current thought : i need some sleep, and a massage i think.. lol  current song: you've got style ~ athlete  im gunna wake up tomorrow morning.. and have fresh blueberries in blueberry pancakes... mmmmmmmmm.... yummy....  but... yea.. sleep is a good thing... i think im gunna go talk to my pillow for a while... lol... g`night.. to ANYONE who reads this stupid stuff...   Love, and peace! Ash

Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense. --Ralph Waldo Emerson

      i really dont have alot to say tonight....  i had a very VERY uneventful day today... i woke up...  at 8 to the darn phone ringing... it was my mom... "can you get up right now clean the house? all you have to work is 2 hours....and i want you to have some if not all of it done when i get home," i proceded to answer "yes mother....." while i was going back to sleep for another 2 or 3 hours... i dont even set my clock anymore.. its the phone... whenever anyone calls... i wake up.  I got up finally, when my dad told me that they were coming home at 11:45 for lunch... man.. did i get up... i had to get the kitchen looking like i  had  something done... and i had cooked lunch...(noodles and corn and a sandwich) and... eh? i dunno  I kinda thought that i broke my computer internet thinger for about 45 mins today... the internet wouldnt work on my computer... and im not supposed to be on here really.. but what else are you supposed to do when noone else is around? anyways.. so i had to figure out what i needed to do.... and.... me im clueless when it comes to networking... i mean.. yea i am ok at knowing computer stuff... but not networking.. so for 45 mins i was running back and forth from upstairs to the downstairs computer room... i thought(cuz it said a network cable was unplugged) maybe if i unplug the cords to the ethernet thinger(the network box) and the internet... and wait a little bit.. that maybe that would work... it said that the internet was working on the computer downstairs... not upstairs... well i was talking to someone on MSN downstairs.. he was talking me through this ordeal... well i said my good-byes and went upstairs to shut off my computer... and i looked on the screen... AND MY INTERNET WORKED!! i dunno how i did it.. but yup! i fixed it... :D  ummm then i talked to my new youth minister about 1)VBS and helping with that .. maybe it will get me outa the house more... 2) about the new youth room 3) about how i need to go to church almost every time we have a 'meeting' so to speak, if i decide to go on the mission trip.. but yea im metting with her tomorrow at 11 to talk about the new youth room that we quite possibly might be getting built....  got ready for work... went to work.. at work i saw my friends lauren and cody come in... i was surprised to see them... well we got done really really early.. Kevin(one of the managers) even made us do jello... and all that stupid stuff.. the candy the dairy... all the stuff that doesnt need to be done... so he sent 2 of us home at 9...  after that i went to see kelly at work... you know what? KFC floors are really really slippery when you walk on them with the 'wrong' shoes so to speak... she is really racking up the money over there... shes makin good money let me tell you! anyways i get to see her tomorrow!  umm... a week ago i bought a gamecube for   25$   brand new! it was played twice(once with me there to see how it worked) but see he bought an x box right after he bought that.. and he was gunna sell it at a yard sale... he sold it to me instead... lol.. its great!   anyways... umm... new list of good songs.... to add on to the ones that you already know about!   You got style ~ athlete Beautiful~clem snide silence is easy ~ starsailor Dark of the matanee~ franz ferdinand Jerusalem ~ mirah Dont be scared~A.R.E. Weapons Bam thwok ~ pixies The wagon ~ Dinosaur Jr. Prize fighter ~ velvet teen   and anything from: *Dashboard Confessionals *Auf Der Maur *Ben Kweller *Jack Johnson *The Shins *Butterfly Boucher *The Sound and The Fury and anything else that suits my fancy right now  anyways.... now that i have said all that 'not alot of stuff' that i was gunna say... im gunna head to bed... i have a busy day tomorrow! g`night yalls!  song of the moment~ misfit ~elefant  thought of the moment~ i wonder what johnathan said to the floor guy to make him walk out crying!   "All our young lives we search for someone to love, someone who makes us complete. We choose partners and change partners.

      I'M BACK! I am soooo ready to just stay at home from now on! im sick and tired of sitting in a small cab of a pickup for 11 hours... yup.. you heard me right 11 hours! its to long! lol... but it was fun seeing all of my relatives and stuff... i mean... yea it was fun! but holy crap! you would think that cuz it was so cold up ther.. that there would be like NO mosiquitos right? no there were about a jillion... and i think that all of them bit me...  umm...on a sad note... my mom got a phone call on the way up to IOWA (yea the flattest most boringest place on earth).... my great aunt called and told her that my cusin commited suicide.. it was really sad... i didnt get to see the funeral, but my sister went today... but... i guess you had to understand the situation to understand why he did it..  the reason we took this annoyingly long JOURNEY to Iowa was to go to this little gravel pit park, sit in a cold shelterhouse, and look around at people who i had NO idea what-so-ever at who they were.. it was cool to know that, yes, i do have relitives other then the ones that i know of... and i mean it was cool to look through all of the scrap books. They had of all the black and white photos, and actual doccuments that my ancestors used to go across the atlantic ocean from denmark, wedding certificates, deeds to homes(which in 1911 were about 165$). they were really really cool.. and i mean... those papers ARE my history and they tell exactly who i am...i thought they were cool...  i got to see my favorite cuzins... Erik, Tyler, and Jenna... it was soo awesome to see them... but.... i dunno really.... i miss them.. but.. what can i do?   and i got to play guitar for all of the people that ended up at our campsite... (which was about 30 million people.. or i guess it seemed like it walking through it our camper)...they said i was good! i didnt think i was.. but.. i made my cuzin chris almost cry(which is a big thing) when i played stairway to heaven.   ummm.... on june 19th... you would think that it would be in the 60's at night right? like perfect sleeping weather... right? well... in iowa... it was soooooooooo incrediably cold.. 48 degrees...IN OUR CAMPER!!!! i feel sorry for the ppl in tents.. thats all i have to say... its tooo cold for me.. i have got to be hot when i sleep.. my sister was so cold that she went and found a tablecloth to cover up with too.. she expected (like all of us) that it was gunna be warm... ehuh! it was cold... so she only brought her special blanket... nonetheless.. she was cold...  i bought a new cd this weekend... butterfly boucher~flutterby.. it is awesome... i love the lyrics... ill post some later for yalls to read..  Lighter news~i hopefully am getting my fone back.. i have to do 10 good deads for my dad.. and then ill get it back... i mean yea.. i still have to pay for the cell fone bill.. but... yea...  tomorrow i have to wash my car.. and wax it(depending on time)... spend 4 hours cleaning my house... get ready for work... and go to work until 11..:( anyone want to come visit me go head! ill be there!  but... o! i just remembered... heres another one of those things that.. well... uh hum... makes me sound like a flake.. but... ok.. well my dad was washing the camper from all the bugs that hit it... like the front.. well.. ok... he had me go and get something inside... i went inside to get it... came back but decided to go the long way around my moms car... and (granted i was walking/running out there) i smacked my right forarm into her side mirror.... really really hard... i think im gunna get a bruise... :(   and before that..! i had to go get my dog from the boarder(the vet)... cuz we didnt really want to take him along... it wouldnt have been fun! anyways.. on our way back from the vet... he decides that on a straight road that... HEY! LETS VOMIT IN ASHLEYS CAR! well see he likes to sit in the back window where the speakers would be... right? where that stuff that is (that is hard to get stuff out of right) yea... and it took me 5 mins to get home (at least... ) and i pulled into the driveway... let my dog out to see my mom... yelled at my mom...    "CHARLIE JUST BARFED IN MY CAR, AND ITS REALLY GROSS! I DONT WANT TO CLEAN IT UP! WILL YOU? YOU WONT? WHERES THE STUFF TO CLEAN IT OUT? EWWWWWWEEEE!"    it was gross  anyways.... onto more important things... MY SISTER IS GONE FOR 2 WEEKS AND IM SOOOOOO EXCITED! my dad got 3 airshow tix VIP at that... free food... and then there is the picnic for the plant that i get to go to on saturday... with OODLES to mexicanos running around... and i get to listen to MEXICAN music ALLLLLLLLL day.. then go to work.. and listen to elivator music.. how fun! anyways.. its all cool!  song of the moment~soul back by butterfly boucher  My good friend Aaron *sprint* has a $300 cell phone bill... (partially due to me) but is not willing and accepting donations to go twards that... and its not a mixup like mine... his is unfortunately, real... :(  Anyways... gotsta get up rrrly so... im gunna head to bed!   Toodles!  Ash!

      i didnt do JACK all day today! like seriously... i woke up at 11 to my dog barking (and didnt stop barking)at something... needless to say... i woke up angry... i went outside to see what he was barking at, my neighbor was putting the springs on her trampoline... and barney(my dog) was barking at peiton and gage, the kids...  grrr.... i wasnt happy... but... what can i say?!   i made lunch there after.. pasta and some awesome mix of stuff i made... im the greatest cook! lol..   after that... i sat on my bottom, argued with Will... for a LONG time... decided that Tristan and i need to do something pretty soon...   did the dishes, watered some dying plants, fed the dogs, and did some stuff before i had to start getting ready for work... i mean... i had to start getting ready at 3:30.. i always do.. it takes that long for me to become 'pretty' or whatever... i normally work at 5... so.. its a little while... i mean.. i wasnt up that long...   i went to work, hung out there... sacked 2 ppls groceries and went to face... facing is SOOOO easy! i swear... until they all start falling out at you! then its not as fun! lol.... but tonight there were only 2 of us..it seems like us to got more accomplished then... then if the other 4 ppl were helping us too... while we were facing.. i got to know this guy, johnathan, hes pretty cool, other then the fact that he does drugs... but i guess after what this guy has gone through... its the least of his problems... he has gone through his girlfriend almost dying of a meth overdose... his friend, kelly, a guy, he is his girl friends older brother, see... well he had a stillborn kid... he didnt want one at first, but he started warming up to the idea.. and then the chick that was having his kid, basically tried to kill the kid... no joke... it was sad.... and.... i dunno... its sad what he has gone through... but hes a really cool guy... one of the nicer guys that i work with.. the other ones.. well 2 at least... all they talk about is their jet ski`s... im not really into that... so im like.... eeeeh? but its cool... he stands up for what he believes in... and thats cool... but...   then i came home mom naged at me for not doin stuff today.. and i talked to my sis for a while... she talked about her day and her friend that stayed the night... it was cool... i miss spending time with her...   then i played some killer guitar... mastered stairway to heaven and behind blue eyes (the who; not limp bizkit) its awesome... i just sat there for 40 mins (at least) and just jammed out! it was awesome... broke another pick... ill have to look under my bed now for some... lol... anyways... now that you have heard about my boring day!....   The camper still isnt fixed.. its been gone a week and a half and they still havent ORDERED the part... stupid morons! were leaveing for a week CAMPING trip! they just dont get it.. they are stupid faces... but anyways...    "The battles that count aren't the ones for gold medals. The struggles within yourself--the invisible, inevitable battles inside all of us--that's where it's at." - Jesse Owens      Big Apple Heartbreak ~Yellowcard   This can't be home anymore if you think i have not been missing the way she breathes you are mistaken my friend I've falling down So put your mouth on my bloody knees  One night with me and I've broken your trust I hate to be the bond you know is gonna bust Hurting lungs from breathing sighs of disgust This can't be home anymore  Now cold concrete blank walls are Staring into your lonely eyes I duck behind them and hope that you won't cry And ask for answers to why I made you cry  I never wanted us to fade out Resting on a love that fell apart Where are you, I need you You still have my heart  Open up my heart

      Ok if you havent already heard... i had a 606$ cell phone bill... which turned out to be (as of right now) 87. 67 or something like that... see what they had was all of my minutes.. even including my night and weekend and moble to moble mins counted as regular mins... granted i had 2700 minutes.. you could see how quicky it would add up... needless to say.. the parentals were hacked of beyond belief! they went in and basically yelled at the at&t ppl and they changed it... O MY GOSH were my rents pissed at me!  so basically i dunno what all my punishment is yet... i know i have to pay for that bill... which is no biggy for me.. i mean it is.. but... its better then them paying it and i feel guilty... but the internet and phone privlages are as of right now... very very limited! lol....  ANYWAYS! onto important stuff...   ummm ive been on social isolation for the past 3 days and im about to die! ive done nothing but watch tv and play guitar... and clean so my rents arent as mad... but i mean.. im NOT the kind of person to watch tv... i dont hardly watch it at all...   FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! I WATCHED THE REAGAN FUNARAL PROCESSION FOR 45 MINS! TALK ABOUT MIND NUMBING.. I MEAN.. YEA HE WAS A PRESIDENT.. BUT PRESIDENT SCHMESIDENT... HE STILL SUCKED!    he wasnt that good anyways.. yea maybe he gave a whole bunch of money to charities and stuff... but i mean comeon! thats why i think i need to stop watching tv... now i know that what my mom told me was true when i sat and watched tv to much... "tv will rot your brain!" .. it sure does... i mean... nothing productive comes out of sitting on your hinny and staring into a screen watching senseless crap all day! i mean... its just not cool! it just isnt..lol...   so... thats why i tend to like music more... and only the stuff   I   like.. i like most music.... not rap or hip hop or any of that crap! its as bad as tv.. it   WILL   rot your brain and brain wash you at the same time! its like F* this,  im gunna busta cap in yo Ass... lets get some hos! i mean... c`mon ppl.. if thats not brain washing then what is?   i dunno.. anyways  i have to go to this stupid family reunion thinger... i really dont want to go.. but they told me that i have to go see these ppl do more then be dead in a casket.... so whatever i guess... i still dont want to go.. i mean.. how stupid is... each family has to wear matching shirts... WHAT!? i mean no... im not doin it!  i got a new swimmin suit today! its cute except my mom insisted for me to get these HUGE bottoms for it... like half my rear is hangin out of em.. its not cool.. and they are all baggy and they really look stupid... but the top is super cute.. and even better its a bikini! i mean.. its really darling... but.... i still hate the bottoms... and my mom told me that i was cynical about the bottoms... and i guess i am.. but whatever i still hate them!... ill prolly go get the size smaller saturday when i go to work... like after work or maybe before im not sure...  anyways... i think that thats all for now...  I LEARNED THE REST OF STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN.. now onto perfecting it...(i broke my first pic in this process :) )  work is fun when you have fun ppl to work with!  i think my iq dropped from watching so much tv today!  before next tuesday im gettin this red papya color in my hair.. i hope it looks cool! i dont want to go up there looking stupid...   i guess thats it...  XoXo

       PEOPLE WHO ARE OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE AND ARE PERFECTIONISTS DON'T APPLY FOR A JOB AT RAMEYS! FOR THAT FACT AT ANY GROCERY STORE!     grr.... My gosh! today... First day of work... I didn't know WHAT to expect...   this is what I learned:   *bagging groceries is not fun! *you don't put bananas with cold stuff.... It angers ppl *as a minor I CANNOT touch any sort of alcohol.. Otherwise ill get a huge fine! *ppl who work there don't get free food! *carts are very hard to push in mass quantities.. *I hate carts *people like me who are obsessive compulsive shouldn't face (kinda like clean up... Pick up straighten) *my feet hurt  *I look stupid in my 'uniform', and I hope to get a smock soon... *there are a lot of Mexicans who like to look at you in Carthage... :|  my feet hurt really really bad!   I got 6 more hours at least for the rest of the week ontop of what I have right now..  I really dislike atheists... I really try to witness to them.. But when they are smarter then I am... I get lost in what to say... im trying the best I can... That's all that matters.. I mean... O my gosh!  listen to what he says:  The purpose of life is to end (HIM)  says:  I was Christian for most of my life   me:  what made you change your beliefs?   The purpose of life is to end says:  I started thinking too much about the religion   The purpose of life is to end says:  at first I just sort doubted it   The purpose of life is to end says:  then I started thinking about every other religion in the world and about human beings, and I realized exactly why Christianity started   The purpose of life is to end says:  it started for the same reasons that the Greeks believed in their mythology and the reason that Buddhists believe in reincarnation   The purpose of life is to end says:  for one, we have a fear of dying   The purpose of life is to end says:  secondly, we're pattern seeking creatures (thus we refuse to believe that we're just "here" -- we must be special, we think)   The purpose of life is to end says:  and lastly, we like to believe there's somebody watching out for us, that we're not alone here     what am I supposed to say to that??I dunno I feel stupid...    ANYWAYS!  I ran today! Gosh did that feel good to just run by myself... To think and stuff...   I really had a boring day.. Like seriously... I worked forever... And that was about it... 2 guys got caught stealing food... I didn't know about it tho... I mean I was in there and stuff.. But... Eh.. I dunno... So.. ANYONE want to work at rameys with me? lol...   I gotta get up kinda early tomorrow... I picked up someone's hours... So I have to work tomorrow.. Man I wish I didn't...  I HOPEFULLY GET TO PUT RED STREAKS IN MY HAIR! I'LL POST A PIC AS SOON AS I CAN GET ONE...... that is if i get it done today!   im hungry so im gunna go get some food and prolly head to bed...   LOVES! Ash

      Driving home from the movies, my dad calls "Where you at?"  My reply...."We just left the movies!"  "ok... Well I'm sittin on the deck!" he said.  I replied, all giggly, since my mom and my sister were talking about the movie and how it reminds them of things...  "We'll be there in 15 mins.. 15 mins.. Wow! Did I just say 15 mins twice? I'm dumb!... Anyways, we will be home pretty soon!"    This whole 15 mins 15 mins thinger has now become the object of torment for my sister... No wait... My family... They like to remind me     Again and again     how stupid and flaky I really am!   Anyways... Waking up to a weedeater at   9:00   yes   9:00   in the morning is NOT fun at all.... At first I thought it was my dad... See he loves the yard to be perfect... But I knew that he had to have gone to work... NO ONE   NEEDS   to weed eat at 9:00 in the morning EVER... But when I looked out my blinds(purposely shut for the sheer fact that I knew that once.. On a sat.. I would be able to sleep in... My parents.. See...They had pity on me knowing that I had only gotten a few hours of sleep in the past few days...And that the sun comes streaming in through those windows every morning.. It gets kind annoying when all you want is a dark room to sleep in... Anyways! Back to the subject) I think that this SLEEP NAZI was out for me.... I mean... I couldn't hide from this.. this.. this ANNOYING noise... I shut my window above my head...And see I have more then the windows above my bed that are open... And I was not about to get up to shut them... Hence me not being able to escape...  Anyways... So I was up!  getting up knowing that for the next four hours all that you are going to do is clean your house... All by yourself... Its not fun! And my sister was still asleep... And I figured... If I was up... She had to be too...Plus then I can annoy her so I had to get her up... I went in seeing this body all curled up in her covers...And said.."Sam you need to get up!" she turned over to face me... And said.."  ssssnnnnnniiiiiigggggdddddddeeeeeaaaahhhh!"    I didn't quite get what she was trying to say so I asked again....  and she replied(more slow this time)....   "sssssssssssnnnnnnnnnnnniiiiiiiiiiiigggggggddddddddeeeeeaaaaaahhhhh!"   like saying it slower would make me understand... Right... Anyways... When my little sister wakes up... She thinks that she can talk like a normal person... All clear like... Well she cant... Maybe she was speaking Swahili... I'm not sure... The morning communication is not so good...But she told me to go away... And me, knowing that my efforts of trying to get her up had failed, I left, letting my dog in there.. Maybe to get her up that way!...I dunno but I guess what she was   Trying   to tell me was "I'm separate!" again, nothing I quite understood.... So I went to work.... And worked cleaning my house top to bottom... Every nook and crannie... Everything...  after that I decided it was time for me to get out the ol' guitar.... And I mean.. I'm not that bad... But I'm not that good... But.. Its just a habit to play it now... I decided to play some of the stuff that I knew... Like AC/DC, Ben kweller, led zepplin, 3 doors down, faith hill, pink floyd, some scales, some of my own stuff that I wrote, and some other bands and stuff...(which I can't remember right now) and then I pulled up californication by the chili peppers... It was great! I learned it... Like a snap! Anyways... All in this time from about 1 til about 5 I decided to play guitar and work on putting my poetry into a blog so that people who want to read it... Can.... And yea... And I worked on that... And then I went downstairs... Played it for my rents (californication) and then my dad told me that he was going to that fight night thing... The BOXING thing..!   Lucky son of a gun! I swear I would have given anything to see that! But its cool... The ppl he was goin with pulled up in a convertible of some sort.... Dang I wish I would have gone...     So as he drove off to do something fun, this guy comes to our door trying to sell me something... Well more my mom but... I didn't know that there really were door to door salesmen anymore... If even ever... I thought that they were just things that the movie makers made up... Anyways... And I kind found that funny... But yea he just wouldn't let me let him go... He wanted sooo badly to sell me this THING! I dunno even what it was...  we decided to have a girls night out! cuz we all wanted to go to the fight night... But we couldn't so if we couldn't have fun there we would go and make our own... We decided to go and see raising Helen... (great great movie! Man I loved it... Reminded me of sooo many ppl) anyways... But we were hungry and decided to go to taco bell(after much deliberation of course...) I got the best steak enchilada I've ever had.... your right Aaron they are awesome! Its been forever since I had one! And a hard shell taco! The people who work there cant understand anything! I wanted tomatoes on it see cuz they normally don't... I mean yea... And sour cream... And they are stupid... I had to tell them 17 million times what I wanted on the damn taco! But yea.... It was still awesome!   we went to go see raising Helen... Good movie! Made my mom cry :'( but its all cool... I mean... Yea the aunt.... Reminded me of my aunt... It was great! Like seriously... She had the mom hair cut and everything... But yea we left after the movie and  my dad calls..... And that's where I begin to sound flaky! I swear I'm not that bad... Or maybe I am... I dunno..... Man I don't think ill EVER live it down!

      first off.... ok yea... i just got done watching  the 2 most scariest movies in the whole world (other then the shining) yea and im scared sooooooooooooo much and so is brenda.... she came over to see it with me... and im happy that she did too.. becuz i dont think that i could have made it thru that thing without her there to hold my hand.. im such a coward(COWARD POWER.. i guess) o my gosh... you would never understand how much a person can yell at the tv and still not affect the movie... she still went the wrong way! AHHH!! lol.. anyways... yea... u know i really liked the song love song by 311 but yea not anymore... i know that that person knows why and its just not fair for me... i dont like this and i feel like i have to wait.... i do... but that would be stupid of me... it really would... to let my childhood years waiting for something that may not even happen... i dont know...but yea i hate scary movies... and i dont think ill ever watch one again! (not really they are great but right now thats how i feel about them... they both were about like psyco people and like psycologiests.. kinda makes me want to be one... just not with like patients like that in a mental institution.. yea kinda wierd... but yea maybe a child psycologist.... maybe

      sometimes i doubt peoples sincerity... and how they say what they say.... and what they really mean when they say it...  i dont know what to think sometimes when i hear some of the things that i hear come out of peoples mouths.... i try, i really do, to be as genuine and forthcoming as possible... i think people take me and my friendship for granted... i know some people do.. maybe being genuine isnt all its cracked up to be...

       I guess being called a licentious harlot isn't a bad thing... o wait! Yes it is.. Its really horrible....And to that person.. who *uhhhem* insisted on calling me it... Thanks... You know that I don't have much confidence TO STARTOFF with... Let alone with someone calling me a   moralless whore  ... yea let me think.. Me, without morals... Not so much.. But whatever you want to think I guess... That is all I'm gunna say about that... And prolly to that person... That was the WRONG thing to say!   anyways.. On to other things...&nbsp; sorry I haven't posted lately.. Things have been unbelievable crazy....   one of the ladies&nbsp;that thinks that she is boss of everything at work... (when she isn't) is now becoming a boss herself... :( I think that she is severely underqualified for that position... Guess the last place she worked? HARDIES! yea... Like I said.. Severely... And now she is my manager... AND to make it better.. She hates me... Like really really hates me... She thinks I'm LAZY.. So she insists on calling me up to sack(cuz she's a cashier) for every piddle thing... Just cuz she can.. Which is ridiculous.. When the night manager,(higher then her) can tell that she ONLY calls you up to sack.. And its retarded stuff too.. So I'm like whatever... I think I'm gunna try to get a better job.. Maybe at For All Bible... I dunno   ummm.... Not a lot else to say.. I worked from 9 til about 2 at home cleaning my house... It sucked royally! Then I farted around till 3:30... Took a shower got ready for work.... And went.. To a sucky day at work... I don't know tho... It was ok I guess.... I had to interpret a Spanish western union form to a guy who "no hablo igles!" (in English~I don't speak Spanish) so I had to translate EVERYTHING for him... Including what everyone else told me to tell him.. It was a test for me.. Let me tell you... Big Spanish person... yea it was ok..... I just got home a little bit ago... I'm thinkin about a lot... But eh?

         ALRIGHT EVERYONE! JUST SO YOU KNOW! THIS THING IS GUNNA&nbsp; BE REALLY SUPER LONG.. IM GUNNA RECAP FOR ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF.. AND ITS ALOT.. SO JUST SO YOU KNOW...      &nbsp;       *This beast is gunna be&nbsp;HUGE*             first off..  i had a great weekend right off for me.. i had friday saturday Sunday and Monday off.. (the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th) so here's what happened during that weekend.. LOL           Friday:  We went to a youth team building retreat to a cabin on Stockton Lake..It was awesome.. We had about 13 people go.. 10 youth... It was great! We played a lot of games... And we had to make eachothers plates for dinner... It was great! We played ping pong...We had this great heart to heart group sharing session devotional type thinger, its really awesome to find out about people....And played life.. a lot! i was on my own team one time.. (im really lucky at that game) and another time i was on Nates team, we ended up with what 5 kids, 2 yhats, a skunk farm, and a ranch... And like 2 cars.. And we ended up with about 8.7 million dollars on the OLD OLD OLD school like highest paid was 25000.. LOL its was great! Anyways... i had a lot of fun! And and And! 4 people ate an entire box of club crackers in 15 mins! yea..&nbsp; then they started watchin the lost arc or something.. i went to bed soon after they started... LOL          Saturday:  we woke up and played this pass around and catch game.. After an EARLY wake up... After a LATE night.. 6:30 comes real fast when you go to bed at 2:30..&nbsp; anyways.. So after that we have this massive game of War... Alright everyone gets a prize.. Its this play money stuff..The winner got the most and on down the&nbsp;line.... And the loser of the whole game of each&nbsp;group got no money... And had to figure out what they were gunna&nbsp;do to get money...&nbsp;that were supposed to use to pay for stuff during the day.. Like it was 100$ to get a ride on the bus to the beach, 200$ beach entrance... 100$ ride back, 100$ a slice of pizza.. It was rough... i was loser of the group.. My sister was the winner.. We shared our money.. i got some donations.. Not many.. But enough to get by i&nbsp; think... So anyways.. After the beach experience.. (which was fun!) Sam left while we were on the beach.. My rents were staying in our 5th wheel anyways.. And she wanted to stay with them.. So i went with the youth group and Sam went with my rents... So i was gunna have my house to myself.... Anyways...We went to the hella cool hawaiian pizza place.. It was awesome pizza... There we ended up eating how much pizza we wanted... LOL... After that we went home... After filling out these really sweet compliment cards... To each person on the group.. Some ppl put on mine that i speak my mind and Im not afraid to tell anyone and everyone what i think or feel about a subject no matter if IM right or wrong... Anyways... So i went home.. i was gunna stay at home by myself.. But i could just fathom what trouble id get myself into right there.. So i stayed at breandas house..     &nbsp;

      Wow! Boring day...   went shopping today... Again.. at the mall... After a long stupid fight/stupid thing i dunno really even what it was.. lol ok here is some of the fight that we (my dad and i) had...   me ~"I don't have enough clothes!"  him ~"well then go buy some more!"  me ~... Pauses to think...  him ~"get some of YOUR moldy money and go buy you some clothes!"  me ~ thinking...'if i was able to go to the mall and buy clothes then there would be NO problem.. Since i CANT..(cuz you wont let me drive on rangeline!)... and i don't want to buy walmart clothes, im screwed really.. and since you hate going shopping... i cant really buy clothes! .....For-petes-sake.. i have clothes from the 4th grade still.... Its time for me to get NEW clothes!' but im really saying~ "whatever you say, i guess im wrong.."  Him ~ "I'll buy you WORK clothes that's it..."  me ~  thinking ... 'YAY! Now i get to walk around lookin like im WORKING!...'  i just don't think that they get it! i dunno its clothes.. a touchy subject i guess lol... Um anyways here is what i ended up getting... lol... They felt bad after the fight and they said that they were sorry and that i could get whatever i wanted... ;) so i got:   **a pink off the shoulder top with a pretty flower.. **a pink striped skorts thing.. it had a nifty ribbon belt... **black pants with wicked cool big buttons on the front{{for work}}(which are STILL TO BIG! lol) **a white shirt (which is kinda see thru) it has white pinstripes running down it.. Its really pretty... ** a white polo(which is to big for me) **and this hella cool pink shirt... Ok see it has the word rocker all over it.. But In the words its a purple guitar.. Its hella cool.. Like i said....     but that's it.. For now... lol.. im gunna work on a pair of shoes for me.. lol  um ok.. Work was... Amazingly awesome today! it was sooo awesome! Ok the guys that i work with.. Hate the floor guy.. They really don't like him.. Well "someone" put a whole bottle of crisco on the floor right before he came to wash those floors.. .it was really funny.. i don't really know who did it.. But... Eh? Its cool... Jake (the night manager) was mad.. But we brought him some lucky charms gummies.. and it made it ALL BETTER!!  and at work.. Ok... When i got to work...(this is the only part that pissed me off about work today).. Ok i went to help fill milk before we started facing and really "working" today.. Anyways.. So im actually working.. lol.. yea ... Me .. i actually work.. Anyways... So im puttin milk in the shelf sort of thing... Well ok.. This ugly lady came to get milk... and opened the door... Well at that same time i was putting milk in.. and she caught me.. So she told me that the chicken cooler was broken... Well while that was happening... The guys (Tyler, Sam, and kendrick) were clucking like chickens.. REALLY loud too.. i guess they thought that she looked like a freakin HUGE chicken... Honestly.. She kinda did.. lol.. But anyways... So i said... "o... Well..."(and contemplating saying something else.) but she closed the door..  Anyways... So one of the checkers {{I have worked longer there then she has}}(who is staying unnamed) decides to call me up to the front to help sack... Ok? it was cool i guess.... Well there were 3 check stands open and they were all AT LEAST 5 carts deep with groceries... She decides to tell me (infront of everyone there) "When a customer tells you that the freezer is broke you need to tell someone of management right then so that they can get it fixed... it makes us look bad for one of our employees to tell someone 'o well'... When they are trying to help you.." She said this infront of about 20 people..  i couldn't believe the balls she had to say that infront of all those ppl.. i took it tho.... and then after i left to go face... i told Jake.. it pissed me off... i wasn't gunna blow up right there.. But i wont speak to her...The only reason i didn't say anything to her was becuz it would be unprofessional... that and im a bigger person then that.. im just saying.. If you have something like that to say to someone.. Tell them in private... Not infront of a bunch of customers... But its cool... Shes gettin fired anyways... So its all cool...   Um... Not much else happened today.... i watched my play for the first time.. it was cool... im such a dramatic person.. lol.. The role of Chi Chi Vazoom... fit me quite well i think.. lol.."OOOOOOOOOOOYYYYYYYYSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTUUUUSSSSSSS" and "Chi Chi Vazoom A.S." *laughing*... Great stuff...lol i guess you had to see the play to understand...  anyways... um.. yea.. i decided last night that im allergic to my day bed... Like noooo jooooke..

      Run like a race for family When you hear like you're alone The rusted gears of morning To faceless busy phones We gladly run in circles But the shape we meant to make is gone  Love is a tired symphony Tou hum when you're awake Love is a crying baby Mama warned you not to shake Love is the best sensation  Hiding in the lion's mane  So I'll clear the road, the gravel And the thornbush in your path That burns a scented oil That I'll drip into your bath The water's there to warm you And the earth is warmer  When you laugh  Love is a scene I render When you catch me wide awake Love's a dream you enter Though I shake and shake and shake you Love is the best endeavor Waiting in the lion's mane     >>(((Soon to come...the new music playlist of the week!!)))<<

      You know? After further thought of... Why do i get paid SO crappy?... i realized... my store is crappy to their workers... Anyways.. So they decided to make me work tonight at... Guess what hours? 5-11 tonight... it sucked.. it was the first time ever that i didn't get to sit there and watch the fireworks... i went outside and acted like i was getting carts so that i could catch a glimpse of the splendor that IS  all of Fourth of July fireworks... Anyways so it sucked really bad.. But what i think is not cool is that i only get time and a half for that.. The people that have to say there... Inside, not watching the fireworks, should get double time and a half.. But i know im just being greedy... So its all cool...  um anyways... i think im allergic to my daybed in my room... Seriously... i think i am.. i woke up this morning... and my throat hurt... i think im allergic to something on that stupid thing.... my gramma hijacked my bed.. So i had to sleep on that.. that.... thing! Ugh! But i woke up i think at 6:30 by my dad tellin me that i had to shut off my computer becuz of a wicked bad storm that was on its way.. So i shut off the computer... and went back to sleep.... i awoke again at... Eh? Around 9-ISH... We had no power.... So my parents were cooking eggs and toast on our grill outside..and in the cleanup process... i wanted to help my mom put the dishes in the dishwasher... Well i broke one of our FANCY FANCY like 25$ bowls.. i chipped it.. my dad was pissed... i didn't mean to so i went upstairs.. i didn't want to help anymore.. So a while later we decided to get outa the house for a while (since we had NO electricity...) they gave me 5 mins to get ready to go to the mall.. yea.. Like it will take me 5 mins or less to get ready... it AT LEAST takes me 10 mins... So they had to wait on me for a few mins... lol.... i didn't have anything to wear.. and when im rushed i always Question... How i look... So i quick and put on some makeup.... and some clothes... and we were off to the mall....  At the mall... Ok? it was about 11 at this time.. Ok? We went to sears first... Looked at some clothes and CRAP! But ok... Listen to (or rather.. Read this).. Ok the mall doesn't open until about noon ok? So we were wasting time until then... Well while still in sears... Sam wanted to go to Sam goodys ok? and get something for her xbox... Ok... Like i told you before.. The mall doesn't open until noon... So ALL the stores... Other then famous and sears were CLOSED! The gate thingers were still down... yea.. She wanted to walk down to Sam goody (half way down the mall, which is really far) so she got pissed and walked away from me... Eh? Suit-herself i guess then.. i just didn't want to walk that far to walk all the way back...   anyways so we went to famous, looked at duvans. sofas?..(i like them.. They are wicked cool, needless to say.. my father HAD to find something he didn't like about it) and then he bought another bowl to replace the one i broke... lol... I DECIDED TODAY! that i am gunna buy one of those SIRIUS things.. Its only like 150$ for your car...(which is where i wanted to put it anyways.. For my beloved indie rock! lol) but i dunno.. Its the guitar or the SIRIUS thing... So.. Eh? Or an IPOD... im not sure what i want... lol  Anyways... and then i went to Sam goody... and bought 3 new CD's.... Yup.. Three...     iron and wine~ our endless numbered days Hopelessly devoted to you Vol. 4~ compilation CD and the great! Beastie Boys~To the 5 Boroughs     i was proud of myself...i was i was.. and they are ALL awesome! i want to go back soon!   my dad is gunna buy me an amp..   lol.. Just thought id throw that out there while i was thinkin about it.. (if you have an opinion about what kind is best... Post and tell me... Thoughts will be taken with open arms.)  anyways... We went to red hot and blue for lunch.. The best BBQ ever! it was great! that was MY celebration of the fourth!... lol i had a half slab or ribs and fried okra and a salad... it was awesome! i love food.... i think id die if i didn't eat...  full, we left... We went home..  i got ready for the suckiest day of work ever! Honestly... Who works on holidays? Who? Obviously me i guess. it sucked...  But im getting good (kinda) pay for it... and i got to eat my leftovers from lunch.. i was the envy of work.. lol.. i couldn't leave early... But i did get to leave on time.. lol.. my mom wanted me to get bacon (not to fatty tho.. lol {?}why?) and paper towels... Before i left... But i left to go home..   got home and my family was sitting infront of a glowing TV screen.. Watching emril cook some sort of lobster, bacon, clam chowder..... yummmmmmm.... i tell ya!  ummm... So anyways... im gunna get goin to bed... i need some quality sleep... lol....  currently listening to~ iron and wine ~ cinder and smoke... Its trippy cool...  Currently craving ~ peaches; considering that we have FRESH picked ones downstairs.. i think im gunna go get me one of those...  currently reading~ the cover slip thinger (booklet you could call it) for iron and wine  Currently thinking about what i need to do~ i need to go swimming.. Anyone want to go??   Talkin to~ Eli and Mallory  Current song im learing on guitar~ MY OWN!!! IM DOIN MY OWN THING NOW!! ITS SOOOO COOL TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT NOW! i wonder if ill ever be as good as Kaki King.. She's awesome... dunno her? Look her up!  um... my good friend.. Aaron.. Better known as sprint... Decided that he was gunna stand next to an artillery shell (2 feet away) while it exploded... So... Lets all give him sympathy.... For his minor wounds... in his arm... Or think about him... Or not think about him... Or something i guess...  i need to devise a scheme to get the IPOD, and SIRIUS thing, and the guitar...  lol... Ill think of something...  Love, Peace, Fireworks!!

      Here is my   DREAM GUITAR    right here... hers a little bit about it.... Fender re-introduced the Jag-Stang guitar, a collision of contemporary features fused together to create a combination of Jaguar and Mustang. Designed by the late Kurt Cobain and Fender, this instrument and the band Nirvana changed the face of music and have influenced people around the world.

      Ok... i haven't said much lately.. So.. Here goes!  i got up today at... Eh? 7:30 i had to be at work at 9(i didn't make it) but... See my clothes that were supposed to be in the dryer drying... kinda.. Were still in the washer in mid cycle... i forgot to close the lid the night before.. So i had wet clothes... and an hour to wash and dry them... The reason i worked a SUCKY 8 hour shift is cuz one of our guys, Dave, he's really old (late 60's).. and he rides his bike to and from work... Well... He left to go home yesterday.. and kinda.. Got hit by a car... So i had to go in and work for him.. it sucked! Like ROYALLY...  But my mom did bring me El Charros.. So it was ok...    .. umm i have 37 hours that i had to work this week..i was only scheduled for 18... kinda funny how things like that work out...  so there hasn't been much goin with me other then workin... umm here's the update on stuff there....  OUR FLOOR GUY IS CRAZY! i work with a bunch of WACK JOBS... Like hard core wack jobs.. They are fruitier then a freakin celebrity fruit basket! one guy makes bombs, not to blow people up.. But things,(and small animals, ON OCCATION .. Like once or twice... Strictly)... Um... i have some guys that are really good to me... a Russian (which when he yells at his mom on the phone.. Its freaking awesome sounding!)... Um.... a body builder..  and well the floor guy is crazy.. But were not gunna go into why... If i told you then you know why.. But i don't think its cool to post on here.... Just ask me and ill tell yah... umm... and then.... then i have super awesome night managers... and some awesome other NORMAL people there...  well see... Today.. i met crazy headphone guy... Ok here's the low-down... He wears these pair of headphones that you would use for a CD player ok? Well... He wears them EVERYWHERE.... and if your talkin to him.. He picks them up like he's listenin to you and he acts like they have music gone thru em.. But with closer inspection of these wonderful headphones there is NO wire attached to them.. AT all... He talks like boomhower(sp?) on King of the Hill... Like you have NOOOO idea what he's saying.. But you know he's saying something.. .  anyways.. He buys 3 things if icecream and some margarine, but he forgets that he needed some sausage so he left to get it... AND IT TOOK HIM 20 MINS TO ACCOMPLISH THAT....We suspended his order and his ice cream began melting... So we took it back..  He came back with hotdogs and the sausage. He wanted twila (the checker) to holdthem while he went back to get the ice cream.. She refused to hold it for him and told him to get a basket.... He said his hands were full... and he refused to get a basket...(i take it that they deal with him a lot)  he came back up to the register and was ticked so he went to another register and cut infront of people so that he could get his food... Like i said.. wackos!...  Um.... Grammas comin down to see me these next 2 weeks... She is bringing my sister with her... her and tammy are staying here for 2 weeks... im not sure how well i like that...  But its cool... i get to spend (what time i have) with my granny and auntie! lol...  i have to work a bunch of hours this next week (30 to be exact if i don't pick up any...) i have to work the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 8th... 5-11 pm.. Its gunna suck! Im kinda angry cuz i might not get paid holiday pay for the 4th when others will get double time and a half! Its stupid....  we did fireworks tonight.. it was awesome! my neck is burnt... (i think i burnt myself with a punk) but i lit some cool stuff.. it was awesome.. i had sooo much fun! and i didn't realize how many little kids we had in our neighborhood: will, lissa, gage peiton, Blake, Emma, Shelby, Spencer, Kara(she's 13), zack (he's 14), Blake, Jeremy(he's 11), regan... and a bunch of other little kid i cant remember names to.. They are all under like the age of 5...So they ALL wanted to light fireworks with me... it was cool... But *shurgs* whatever makes them happy... i swear we spent over 500$ - 600$ as a neighborhood group... it was awesome...   anyways.... i have to get up and piddle my day away again.. work til noon for my rents cleaning the house... then chill for a little bit (like 3 hours) then get ready for work and work from 5 -11... urgh.... Long long day ahead of me...  currently craving~ sleep! and strawberry banana homemade ice cream that i had earlier!  listenin to~juliette lewis and the licks : shelter your needs  newest great song for me~ anything by kaki king...She's a badass guitar player...   currently reading~ something about the shooting at the ConAgra in KC... Its to bad...  Some guy went in and shot 5 other ppl in the cafeteria and then shot himself... :(  thinkin~ my feet hurt really really bad... i need to start "gellin" or something... and soon... and that i need some sleep...  anyone have the new Beastie Boys CD that wants to.. Help a poor kid out and burn it for me? i dunno... Anyways... Just a thought...  i need to get to sleep.... I've decided what im gunna buy after this summer!   a fender jag stang reissue series guitar.. Its freakin awesome... and at 3 easy payments of 176.66.. ill have it in no time.. psh! yea .. Right no time... lol... But its beautiful! Like.. Its THE guitar...If i can find a good pic of one.. Ill put it on here.. Its .. Awesome....   anyways.. gunna go to bed...  Toodles!
