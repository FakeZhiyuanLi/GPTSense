      Here are the songs:   urlLink Velvet Revolver’s  Slither: How can you go wrong with a band comprised of former Guns ‘n Roses members and a lead singer that doesn’t know what the term “rehab” is.   urlLink The Hive’s  Walk Idiot Walk: Don’t you just want to yell this at the opposing team when they turnover the ball or when you sack the quarterback. Better yet, it brings back the days when we played football at recess and after you scored a touchdown you would announce to the other team, “Winner’s stay. Loser’s walk.” Unfortunately I wound up walking even when I had scored a touchdown.   urlLink Filter’s  Take a Picture: Again, the lyrics are the story behind this selection, though I enjoyed Filter’s second album. I especially enjoy when this song blares after I ran a 75-yard touchdown with  urlLink Thomas Jones .  AC/DC’s Thunder: I am typically not an AC/DC fan. The reason I add this song is for the simple fact that at every Minnesota Viking’s game you hear this song played 75 times throughout the game. I’m looking for a little authenticity therefore AC/DC has to be added.   urlLink Chemical Brother’s  Block Rocking Beat: This is an oldie but a goodie, and it has that hook that I can’t get out of my head. This is also the only reason that I did not put techno music on the regulations list (though I do not believe there are any other techno songs that match the quality of this one).   urlLink Metallica’s  Disappear: Ironic, plus a sound that gets the stadium pumping.  Limp Bizkit’s Nookie: This used to be a fan favorite, and I believe it can still be used for good.  So there are 7 songs that should be included in every football video game. Is this the definitive 7? Perish the thought. These 7 songs represent a further outline in choosing the appropriate music for ESPN NFL 2K5, and should increase the enjoyment of a stellar game. I should mention that  urlLink Austin’s  recommendations are great as well: Yellowcard and the Imperia March ( urlLink Darth Vaders’  Theme). Both are songs that I did not think of but would be great additions.  Finally, for those who are wondering, I will not be  urlLink trading  Marty Booker in my season; I already picked up  urlLink Michael Strahan  from the trading block. And with my current team I went 15-1 and I will be playing the Detroit Lions in the NFC Championship game.

      Yesterday, I focused in on a debate more furious than the Bush v. Kerry campaign:  urlLink ESPN  v.  urlLink EA Sports . There was not a real conclusion but it did bring up an intriguing question: what would the ultimate sports video game soundtrack be compiled of?  Well I’m glad I asked myself that question (ESPN asked a similar question and  urlLink here  is their take on it).  While I was driving home yesterday (only 1 hour and 15 minutes yesterday) I began to think what the ultimate collection would include and whether or not I should have regulations governing my picks.  I considered the following policies (not as clever as  urlLink others  but it will have to do).   The list cannot include country music.  I realize that there are people that listen to country and enjoy football.  But what sport is usually associated with country music?  That’s right… urlLink NASCAR .   Racing is built upon country music and vice versa.  During my country phase in junior high I remember seeing numerous country music videos shot with NASCAR stars or the location of the video was on a racetrack.  I am not against country music, but I do not feel it is the appropriate music for a sports video game.  Personally, I do not want to hear the  urlLink Dixie Chicks  start singing away when  urlLink Marty Booker  scores a 55-yard touchdown.  (On an aside,  urlLink Kid Rock  does not count as country.  Yes, he does have a country twang to him at times and he loves rolling with old school country artists, but for this arguments sake he is defined as (Kid) Rock.  Besides, I don’t think any country artist would have a chance with Pamela.  She has too much of a history including Tommy Lee.  That is definitely anti-country.)  The song must have a great catch and/or hook.  How else can you explain the rise of such wonderful hit as  urlLink Who Let the Dogs Out ,  urlLink Whomp! There It Is , and  urlLink C’Mon ‘N Ride It (the Train)  at sporting events.  Mind you, none of these will be included in my list, but the reason these songs became popular is the simple fact they had a hook that can be played within 20 seconds and give the sensation that you heard the entire song (which you basically had b/c they repeated the same line over and over and over and over and over and over again).  Plus, a great hook makes people, players, coaches pumped for the play that happened or is going to happen.  The song must not have been used by Madden.  This one has thrown kinks into creating the list, because Madden 2003 and Madden 2005 both have songs I would easily put on the list.  But by having the song previously on a game it plays with my mind and takes away my objectivity.   In essence I have been  urlLink conditioned .   So now that I have explained my selection process I will post my song selection on my next post (sorry if this resembles the results show of American Idol…I just want to make sure I present the best songs possible).   All the excitement of the song selection has limited my time on speaking on the Olympics.  This is probably for the best though, because my interest is waning.  I cringe every time I hear about the USA basketball team, and I have seen my 4-year allotment of gymnastics.  I would like to tell you I am intrigued by the Track and Field events but there has been too much drama and not enough big names that I can connect with.  Oh well…Go  urlLink Phelps !

      OK...so I didn't post anything until 2 days after creating my blog. Is this really a crime? Have I wronged people in not sharing my witty banter (of course banter would require additional people communicating between one another, but I think you hear me knocking)? None the less here are my comments on the past couple days.  I have spent most of my free time playing various games on my Xbox with ESPN NFL 2K5 dominating most of my time. I have successfully finished the first half of the season going 7-1 (darn those Bucs) with the Chicago Bears. This is the first year that I have decided to go with a sport genera game and it was not an EA Sports product. I have been an avid supporter of EA since Madden came out with the Super Nintendo, but due to the price ($20) decided to go with ESPN and I have not been disappointed. At first I felt like I was cheating on my girlfriend during high school, a lot of new features that I didn't know existed and the excitement of something new. I thought once the newness wore off that I would get sick of it, but I've played 12 games in a season (4 preseason for those counting) and I have not grown tired of it. The best feature is that I can add my own music tracks to the game which brings me to a question...what is the best music for a football game? Yes, I realize ESPN had a similar article(I will try to find the link and post it for your enjoyment), but I'm asking what song, band, album is the most appropriate for a football game. I am going to mull it over before I come to a conclusion but I would like to hear any ideas.  This is the point in the article I was going to talk about the Olympics, but due to time constraints I will write about my thoughts on that tomorrow. I will touch upon the the USA basketball team, gymnastics, and what I have heard as the lack of interest in it this year. I will also answer what the best mix of music for a football video game is.  Anyway, enjoy the evening and remember to give your support to Paul Hamm. I have a feeling he will do  urlLink well .

      On a whim I thought I would create a blog and see what happens. Now, after reading the previous sentence I realize that I probably started off like the majority of people. So in continuing in the introductory fashion, I will be dutiful in writing numerous posts each week and filling this space with interesting comments concerning sports, politics, and life in general (and probably in that order).  Now that my obligatory opening paragraph is over I will continue with the obligatory 2nd paragraph explaining a little about who I am. Currently, I work for a real estate company in the Twin Cities, and I will be attending graduate school at the  urlLink University of Minnesota  in the   urlLink Human Resource and Industrial Relations  evening program.  For those who do not know what that means...join the crowd. I have been married to my beautiful bride for a little over a year, and we just moved into our new home a few months ago.  So there is the "pertinent" information regarding my life. Besides, by reading through my eventual posts (that will be up practically every other hour as my first paragraph so aptly outlined) you be given an even better picture of who I am and what I am about (to tell the truth, if you are reading this you probably already know me though if you are a complete stranger...all the more power to you).  (On an aside, which I will have often, why do we feel it is mandatory to put complete sentences in parentheses. I have already been guilty of this 3 times and I have written 3 paragraphs (5 including this paragraph and current pretenses). Where did we learn this habit? Was it by instant messaging people and trying to set things off as an aside? is it that previous generations never had asides worth mentioning and all of a sudden we have comedic writers who have wonderful insight that must now be put in an aside to make us realize their additional comments are hilarious? I just put that out here now because my posts will probably be filled with parenthetical asides and I wanted to test the waters.)  Well, I thank you for reading my first post. Any comments on the aside thing would be appreciated. I am positive there will more posts to come (of course...who would say they would put posts up every second and not follow through). Until then....
