      Id Software's Todd Hollenshead has confirmed that Doom 3 has gone gold and been whisked off for duplication. "Yes, this is the official word that DOOM 3 has been code released and has been approved for manufacturing!" Hollenshead wrote in a.plan update this evening.  "Retailers in the States will be allowed to pick up games starting at 12:01 AM on August 3rd. The official street date is actually August 5th in the U.S.A., but some of your favourite stores will probably have it early for those of you who have to have it first," he wrote, before moving onto the subject of international releases, including Europe.  "Internationally, the game will take a few more days to make it to the store shelves. The UK will probably get it first, on or about August 6th. Everywhere else will probably be Friday, August 13th (que Twilight Zone Theme) or close to that date, with just a few exceptions (e.g. Russia and Poland). This isn't because we don't have love for you folks outside the U.S., but the localization and manufacturing process takes a bit longer outside the U.S. where we will have JVC run 24/7 to get the units built. I guess the European manufacturers prefer to give their employees nights and weekends off. Go figure!"  Hollenshead has also promised "preparation tips" in the near future. "In the meantime, I want to see those "DOOM 3 GOLD!!!" threads set new records for swamping message board servers, destroying productivity, and post counts," he added.  get more at www.eurogamer.net :P   urlLink

      Introduction and Breakdown  This guide begins somewhere in the middle of most peoples' journeys in Counter-Strike. Since most of the readers probably are or have been in Counter-Strike (CS for short) clans, you obviously know the basics of how the game is played, so I won't waste time with that. What most people do not know however are some of the finer points of the game.   Through my years spent playing I have seen countless numbers of clans lose matches or break up because of the simple lack of understanding of some of the finer points that bring you success in the game. The basic points such as how to play, the different map types, the controls, etc. are all you need to know how to play on most public servers worldwide. This guide does not focus on public game tactics. From this guide you will learn how to win and succeed as a team and defeat the majority of clans you will ever face in your time in this game. The purpose of this guide is to leave something to the community that will hopefully have a lasting effect on the players and clans to come.   What are the finer points I am talking about? Teamwork, map strategies, coordination, timing, tricks and boosts, intelligent play, working the map, and clan management are the main issues with clans today. It's remarkable how much improvement your clan will show when you master just a few of the finer points. One of the key words that will be emphasized time and again in this guide is efficiency. To win in CS you have to be efficient in every aspect of the game. This includes shooting, moving, communicating, managing, and everything that you do in and out of every match you will ever play in your life. Sound complicated? It is. Is it hard? Very. Is it worth it? If you're a serious or competitive person, the answer is a very resounding yes.   So you want to know what the best tip I can give you on succeeding as a clan? Here you go: If you are efficient, you will win. Being a successful CS clan requires more than just playing in matches and scrimmages. It requires work, and it requires desire. It requires thinking about the scrimmages and the matches. It requires thinking of new strategies and new ways to defend. I cannot tell you everything about CS, and even if I could, I wouldn't because some things are best left to be discovered on your own. You have to always be looking to adapt and evolve, and if you are serious about being a CS clan, then this guide is all you need to get started on your way to success and victory. The rest is up to you!   Breakdown Your success as a CS clan can basically be broken down into two categories: Individual Play and Team Play. Each of these account for roughly 50% of your success in matches, give or take about 15% per situation. Teamwork gets you into the right position to win, but skill is what pushes you over the top. Skill may be what gets you the kills, but if you don't have the teamwork and strategies to get you in the right spot at the right time, you won't even get the chance to pull the trigger. The two co-exist harmoniously, and you cannot succeed without both. The one wildcard factor is intelligence. Skills and teamwork can be taught, but if a player doesn't have intelligence, he isn't going to go very far in a clan. You can teach anyone how to aim, where to shoot, how to fire each gun, and where to sit or stand. You cannot, however, teach someone how to think or how to adapt to every situation. The best CS players in the world are the ones that win with their minds, not their skills alone.   The first part of this guide will cover individual play, focusing on the following: basic gun skills, making the map work for you, playing intelligently, preparing yourself for the competitive mindset, and then some basic tips and tricks to give you an edge over other players.   The second part of the guide is going to cover the basics of competitive play as it relates to the team: moving as a unit, covering all locations and teammates, assigning and understanding roles, reacting and adapting to situations, and most importantly map specific strategies.    Individual Play  The first part of this section is going to focus on outright skill with the guns of CS. Since it would take a great deal of time and space to cover every weapon, I'm only going to cover briefly the ones that are actually useful in competitive CS: the m4a1 (Colt), the AK, the AWP, the MP5, the DE (Deagle/Desert Eagle), the USP, and all three of the grenade weapons. These guns are the most versatile, and therefore most useful guns in the game. The need for versatility comes from the fact that you can never know what is going to happen and what situation is going to come up in a round, and you're going to want the gun that gives you the best chance of survival. Believe it or not, many clans nowadays are leaning away from heavy usage of the AWP because it's not versatile enough on maps such as de_Dust2 or de_Inferno. Each weapon will come with a brief description and notes on how and when it is best used, as well as instructions on how to optimize performance and efficiency of the gun at close range (the distance between the double doors and the terrorist side of the bridge room on de_Aztec, approximately 0-15 feet), medium range (the distance from the terrorist entrance to the hall and the back wall of the hall on de_dust, approximately 30-50 feet), and long range (across the bridge on de_Aztec, approximately 50+ feet). All of the weapon strategies are based on the assumption that you are aiming for the head first, as this is the most efficient way of killing an enemy. This said, we will start off with the game's most versatile gun.   Colt- The Colt is hands down the most often used and most versatile gun in the game. The two modes of fire, despite many myths about them being entirely different, are fairly similar in everything. The only notable difference is that the silenced colt will not kill with one headshot on an opponent with 100 life. It will do somewhere around 97 damage, but it usually does not outright kill them. The colt has a high rate of fire and a deals a high amount of damage. At close range a five shot burst is very effective. Generally the action moves too fast to aim for the head but if you can, you should definitely go for it. If you are sitting at a corner, keep your crosshair at head level. At medium range, start off using a three shot burst aimed at the enemy's head and pull the crosshairs down slightly after the second bullet has gone off. The Colt has no real noticeable recoil within the first two shots. Eventually you should progress to the point where you can use a five shot burst at enemies at medium ranges, but it takes time and practice.   There are two methods of shooting the Colt at long ranges. If you can keep your crosshairs steady while firing, I suggest a two shot burst aimed at the base of the neck or head without adjusting your recoil. If this is difficult for you, try tapping the fire button somewhat slowly instead of burst firing. Fully automatic firing of the Colt is always very tempting because of its high rate of fire and relatively vertical recoil pattern. Plus, it just feels good. However, I never recommend fully automatic as a method of firing though because it will become a habit that is very hard to kick. There are, of course, times when you do it either out of necessity or surprise that are perfectly acceptable though. When should I use the silencer? This is really a matter of choice. The obvious places to use a silencer are when you are concealed somewhere and don't want to be seen. For example, in a dark area where the muzzle flash can alert your enemies as to your location, or when you don't want the enemy to be able to pinpoint your location based on the sound of your gun. But, if you're not good with the silenced version, you can get by without ever silencing your gun. Personally I use the silencer at medium ranges and sometimes at long ranges because I like the recoil of the silenced Colt at medium ranges best. Experiment and find the best places for you to use the silencer. Honestly, the best thing to do is just figure out which you're best at on the particular day you're playing; they aren't that much different. If you copy your un-silenced sounds and renamed them as the silenced and put them in your sounds folder and play like that, you'll find that you really can't tell much of a difference at all. The Colt is probably one of if not the best gun for taking out multiple enemies at once due to its high rate of fire, damage, and accuracy.   AK- The AK is a devastatingly lethal weapon. It is the most powerful of the assault rifles and also the most accurate in terms of the first two shots. While its fully automatic accuracy is not very good at all, its two shot burst is extraordinarily deadly. If you're all about accuracy and efficiency, and you like to pick your enemies off one at a time instead of spraying, go for the AK. The AK is basically the sniper's assault rifle. You should never shoot more than five shots with the AK in a row. For long distances, shoot a 1-2 shot burst, and for mid distances use a 2-5 shot burst depending on the situation. Usually though, three shots are enough to kill just about anyone during a fight in game, and if you have good aim, the AK is a headshot machine. Using the AK is basically about two things and two things only: straight up aim, and reverse-movement timing. Reverse movement is a skill where you strafe one direction, stop and then press the other strafe key the second you let off the first one, thus making the game believe you're standing still for the split second that you can fire off a two shot burst. If you're very good, you can get to where you can reverse strafe multiple enemies to their deaths while getting nothing but headshots because of the false non-movement you trick the game into computing. The AK is not as good at killing multiple enemies at once as the Colt is, but for one-on-one fights it's the better gun because of its higher accuracy and greater damage.   AWP- The AWP is the game's basic one-shot wonder. Many people look down on the gun saying it's only for newbies, or it's only for people with no skill. Well, I'm going to tell you right now that if you are one of those people, you shouldn't even be reading this guide. This guide focuses on getting better, and if you're going to have an attitude like that, you don't want to get better. The AWP is the basis for many, many map-specific strategies. Now, everyone knows how to shoot the AWP: zoom in and click on a target. Not many people are skilled or even familiar with the alternate way of shooting the AWP, which is commonly called "no scoping". No scoping consists of either sitting un-zoomed or using the pistol crosshairs as a reference point and switching to the AWP, and then pressing the zoom key followed in a split second by the fire key. It sounds difficult, but watch good players in match demos (POV only, HLTV doesn't show zoom), or on public games and you will see it done a lot. The benefits of this method are that it allows you to still see the normal speed of action and the normal amount of area, which makes it easier for you to aim up close and move around while aiming. Mastering the AWP is a sure-fire way of providing your team with some seriously clutch kills in matches and you can easily win most if not entire rounds by yourself just from AWPing.   MP5- The MP5 is one of the most cost-effective guns in the game. It is extremely useful for its cost, as it provides a fairly damaging, high rate of fire, automatic weapon. It makes up for its accuracy with the fact that it loses very little while moving, so it is a very versatile attacking weapon in close circumstances. At range, tap the fire button to attack enemies. At mid ranges you can shoot five shot bursts at the neck/head level, and up close you can just spray it. The thing to watch out for, however, is that the MP5 eats through bullets like crazy. Before you know it, your gun is clicking empty so be sure to watch the number of shots you have left at all times. The MP5 is a cheap, efficient way to get some easy kills on enemies at close ranges.   DE- The DE (Desert Eagle) is by far the most powerful pistol, and can be used quite effectively because of its accuracy and ability to pierce through walls. Do not shoot the DE as fast as you possibly can or you will not hit anything unless you're up very close! Leave a little bit of time in between shots instead and your results will skyrocket.   USP- The USP is another great pistol, probably the most versatile of all the pistols in CS. It is fairly damaging, has a low rate of fire, two modes of fire, and a good sized clip for a pistol. You can spam off about five shots before the recoil starts going to hell at medium range. At long range and medium range it is best to leave a little bit of time in between shots. The USP has fairly good jump-shooting accuracy as well.   Glock- Most people hate the Glock because it's so weak. When used in a group of five, however, the Glock is not that bad of a pistol. If you have good aim, the Glock is a very good gun once you can close the distance to medium range. The single fire mode with the Glock straight up sucks. There's no other way to put it. The burst-fire method, however, is very, very useful. It is capable of getting you devastating headshots and doing very significant damage to the enemy at medium to close ranges. Practice using the Glock and you can get pretty good at it! A great tip for Glocking is that if you shoot a single-shot and then right click immediately and shoot another shot of your burst, you won't lose any time in between shots if you click fast enough. Basically you're shooting a four shot burst in a fraction of a second longer than it takes to shoot the normal burst. This is undoubtedly the best method for Glocking. Use your single shot to hit the enemy and freeze them in their tracks (or get a quick headshot) and then switch to burst immediately and aim to kill. The Glock also has pretty good jump-shooting accuracy.   Grenades- There are three different weapons in the grenade class: the Flashbang (FB), high explosive grenade (HE), and the smoke grenade (SG). The HE can cause a maximum of about 96 damage to an opponent, but its blast radius is not that large and is fairly concentrated. Everyone knows what a hand grenade is, and everyone can guess how to use it. The Flashbang is an awesome tool, and in the right hands is the most effective weapon in the game. The FB can render enemies completely useless and defenseless. Find good reflection points off of walls and objects to blind the enemies at strategic locations to kill or pass them by, but watch out for teammates! The FB also makes a different sound from the HE when bouncing off walls so use this to your advantage. The SG is the most underrated weapon in the game. It can effectively shut down an entire team's defenses on its own. Five smoke grenades will limit visibility to about nil, and you could literally moonwalk naked two feet in front of an enemy and he wouldn't have a clue. They are especially effective in neutralizing AWPers and crashing the computers of people with crappy video cards. Anyways, use these in your rushes to provide a clear path through an area so you don't get killed by enemies in strategic locations.   Should I give away the coolest trick in the world with the SG? Alright, I'm feeling nice tonight so you guys are lucky. The SG makes the same sound as the FB does when it bounces off of a wall! "So what? Big deal you ignorant fiend," you may say. Well here's where the trick comes handy. Say the enemy is smart and knows that HEs and FBs make different reflection sounds. The enemy is sitting inside of a door and you know he is but if you rush in, he'll kill you. Throw an SG off the wall, and when he turns to try to avoid it because he thinks it's an FB, run in and kill him! Throw the SG and just keep running so you can utilize it before they realize the feint. This trick works honestly about 75% of the time you do it in matches. The only way to counter this is to look and see if the object is green (SG) or gray (FB), but by the time you do this you'll probably be killed by the rushing smoker anyways.   Working The Map Now that you know how to shoot, it is time to learn how to use the map to your benefit. There are a few little tidbits of information I'm going to give you before we go on to examples. The only guns that can penetrate through objects and hit enemies are the rifles, the Para machine gun, and the DE. Bullets lose a percentage of their lethalness through different types of materials. Bullets traveling through wooden crates will lose a small to fair amount of damage depending on the gun. Bullets traveling through concrete boxes and walls lose roughly half of their deadliness varying on the weapon used. Distance also decreases the damage inflicted by all guns except the AWP. The basic rule of thumb for working a map is that you want to give yourself the best possible shot while making you as hard to hit as possible.   Another key point is to always remember to shoot through boxes and walls that you think your enemy is hiding behind. You may score a good bit of damage or even a kill from a little bit of spamming.   Hiding behind objects is a good way of ambushing your enemy from behind. If they are careless enough to not check behind spots to find you, then you are usually free to give them a quick burst to the back of the skull and send them on their way.   Hiding behind cover and using it to pop out and fire a burst and then hide again is not too difficult of a concept, but many people fail to do this or do it incorrectly (such as only ever coming out of one side of the cover). You think about it beforehand, but when you get in the situation you move out and just stop. And sit there. Like a duck. And get killed… over… and over… and over. So for goodness sake, if you have the chance to hide, do it, and do it correctly!   A harder concept is moving and using cover at the same time. Another basic rule is to not shoot while running. You can shoot while walking, just knock off a shot or two from your normal burst numbers, but do not shoot while running. If even the very first shot hits while you're running, you got lucky. Anything after that is just BS. The best way to think of this is to break moving down into two categories: advancing and attacking.   Advancing: You generally want to throw your FBs and SGs while advancing so as to enable yourself as far an advance as possible before stopping to shoot. Given that the enemy is usually in a set position that is most beneficial to their weapon of choice when you are advancing, you want to change the location that the actual fight will take place in to put them at the greatest disadvantage, i.e. close in on an AWPer as much as possible and keep your distance from an enemy who has a pistol or MP5. Attacking: The best place to stop and attack is naturally behind an object that conceals you from view and offers you protection, but be wary of staying in hiding too long as you give the enemy more time to advance and surround you. Use your HE to finish off weakened enemies, and always aim for the head with your weapons. You want to minimize the attacking time while maximizing the kills. The most successful attack is the one that only kills the enemies guarding your immediate destination before the others can get there to fire a shot. Basically, you want to advance as much as possible and only attack when it will benefit your advancement. Holding an area you've advanced to is much easier than trying to kill someone while running at the same time. Even if you end up scaring an enemy away rather than killing him, that is perfectly fine as long as you make it to your destination. Combine the two so that they fit together flawlessly and flow smoothly and you'll be an expert terrorist in no time.   One of the keys to doing well in CS is playing intelligently. Being able to play intelligently is having the ability to understand what is going on and to be able to predict what kinds of results will come about from the actions. Being able to accurately associate your teammate's location on the radar to their location on the map is a large part of this, but even larger is to find the holes in your team's locations that would allow the enemy to break in. Playing intelligently also involves knowing where the enemy is most likely to be and knowing the best way to dispose of them, preferably before they are able to defend themselves by using Flashbangs or shooting through walls.   Another one of the key elements in learning to play smart involves utilizing your sound. Most people don't play with their sound on loud enough or play without headphones. I will say this once: you will not be good at CS if you do not have either surround sound or headphones. 95% of good CS players use headphones. Now, once you have your headphones, try to play in pubs and use your ears to help you find out where the enemy is and when he's going to pass into your line of sight before it happens. Pubs are the best place to practice sound because basically everyone runs almost all the time in just about every pub in existence. Use this to your advantage! Unfortunately, intelligent play is something that cannot and should not be taught. Learning to play with your brain will breed creativity and an ability to instantly adjust to the situation immediately and effectively. The players that are most feared are the ones who possess a devious cunning as well as skill. The smartest player in the world may very well be able to beat the most skilled player in the world the vast majority of the time. If you are outgunned, outskilled, or outnumbered, you must rely on your brain to win the situation. Learn to rely on your brain and let your skills be just a supplement. Intelligence is basically the teamwork involved when talking about only one player. The brain will get you there, and the skill will finish it off.   If you ask anyone who is a seasoned veteran of competitive CS, they will tell you that you must adopt a totally different mentality to play in a match as opposed to a public server. You need to be infinitely more aware of the situation and you have to make as few mental errors as you possibly can. You need to be able to decide the best methods of attack or defense, and do everything you can to help your team win the round.   How can I make myself change from the pub mentality to that of a match player?   Download demos of matches from tournaments. Watch how they play and the way they act in game. Try to emulate them and use it as a base to build your own style and gameplay. Use the tricks and little things they do in your own game.  Once you have that base, start playing pubs as if it were a match instead of just a pub. Use the tactics you would use in a match in the public servers. As a warning ahead of time, your scores will probably be lower in general than they were before, but that is because you don't have much of a team to rely on. This is a great way of building your abilities, and it is a proven success. When all you know is how to play smart, you will make very few mistakes when it counts.  Play in PUGs (pick-up games) or scrims with your clan as much as possible. The more you are placed in the situations, the more you are forced to adapt to win. Evolution is the key to success in CS, and it only comes with time and practice.    Teamwork   The first rung of climbing the ladder of teamwork to victory starts off with communication and performing as a unit. The ultimate CS team is the one that knows exactly what is going on in each member's mind and knows exactly where they are and what they will do next. Theoretically, the best CS team could only exist if it was one person playing as all five players or a team full of the Psychic Friends Network. However, since perfection does not exist one can only strive to be the best, which is defined as the one closest to perfection. Communication leads to understanding of the situation and the factors involved, which in turn leads to the possibility of reacting as a cohesive unit to the given situation. So, one can say the formulas looks something like this:   Good team communication => Understanding and the possibility of success => Success  Poor communication => Failure   As stated before, success is a two-sided weapon. It requires teamwork and strategy as well as skills. The teamwork lets you avoid failure in the first part of the equation, but it cannot bring success from the second. Skill alone brings the total success from the point achieved through teamwork.   Since CS is a real-time game, good communication is defined as maximizing understanding while minimizing the time it takes to transmit the information. If you spend too much timing getting the point across, it won't appear on screen or on voice communication until you're in the evil fade to black mode. The best way to streamline the amount of information you need to share is to spend a good deal of time before each match defining everything, i.e. saying "Box Strat" takes a lot less time to get across than detailing every part of the strategy during the game. Name and define your positions, strategies, and defensive flexes before the game begins. A lot of times the amount of communication alone can determine five or more rounds easily. If a team knows exactly how to react to a good number of general occurrences, it has a strong chance of being in position to win each round. The less time it takes to get your point across, the more time you have to focus on actually playing and winning the game. So theoretically, a team with great communication has more time per round to win than a team with bad communication, because they have more of it to focus and execute. I bet you wish you were a Psychic Friend now don't you?   Ok, so your team is now able to talk to each other quickly and efficiently, update each other on changes in the situations, and understand what is going on because of this. The next part is being able to function efficiently as one unit. Functioning as a unit basically means that you move together, act together, react together, and turn yourselves into a deadly killing machine. The functionality of a team is kind of an extension of their communication. Being able to function means that everyone knows what to do and performs effectively when communication via team talk or voice communication is not an option, mainly during fights and advancements. The perfectly functional team is the one that does not need to use voice communication or team talk to transmit any information, because that leaves them with the most possible time for actual playing. The Psychic Friends Networks makes yet another point as to why they are the ultimate CS team. Unfortunately, this is a very hard thing to teach to someone because there are an infinite number of situations that could occur. The best way to do this is to teach a basis for a set situation and then forcing the players to learn the different variations to the set based on their own experiences. In case you are still in the dark as to what being a functional team is, here is a list of things that a functional CS clan would do in matches: not run in to each other while running, know when covering a teammate will be necessary ahead of time, move in a way that best covers every possible enemy location while still leaving yourself close enough to provide good concentration fire, knowing your team's strengths and weaknesses and playing the best to exploit them, weaving in and out of friendly locations while advancing, trusting your teammates, and recognizing and using cover effectively to make your advancing move. Remember, it is important to always cover locations that enemies and your teammates might be at all times. Another point is to make sure everyone knows how to use his radar effectively. The combination of radar and knowledge of a map's layout can help you pinpoint where an enemy is when someone on your team goes down.   Roles One of the most important ingredients to CS success is roles. The roles in CS involve a couple of categories complete with their own subcategories. Naturally the best players are able to fill multiple categories in case of any instances that may occur in a match. The main categories can be broken down into these: attacking or defending, reconnaissance (a big word meaning "the guy who sees where the other guy is"), and then the in-game commander. Attacking can be divided into what type of gun you use and what you do in the particular rush, i.e. lead the rush or throw the FBs, etc. Defending is basically if you're in a set position, roaming, and if you are ambushing or in the open. Reconnaissance doesn't really have any real subdivisions and is usually filled as a sub-role of another category. It is usually a good idea to make your reconnaissance based mostly on sound, though, because if you peek too much, you're very likely to get sniped off or prematurely killed and put your team down. The in-game commander is the guy who calls out the strategies, and it's very possible the identity changes whether on defense or offense. Generally though, most clans should have one man calling the strategies. Out of five or more members, you will typically have one person with a particular knack and liking for it. The next step is to decide who is going to fill the roles of what you're trying to accomplish. The three things you have to go by on your choices are the player's experience, strengths and weaknesses, and level of skills.   The second part of the guide is going to cover the basics of competitive play as it relates to the team: moving as a unit, covering all locations and teammates, assigning and understanding roles, reacting and adapting to situations, and most importantly map-specific strategies (which will be added as a separate part of the guide). Generally, when advancing on offense there are three basic methods of advancing: quick, slow, and clearing/securing. When advancing quickly, you basically want to engage the enemies minimally with the focus on getting to your objective as soon as possible. You should still shoot at the enemy, but you shouldn't stop and have an all-out firefight with them, as it sacrifices speed and gives the enemy more time to react and flexibility to your movement. Quick advancement is always done with everyone running. Slow advancement is where the whole group walks and does their best to stay behind cover and out of enemy vision. The purpose of slow advancement is usually to either sneak up on enemies behind their positions or to get as close to their location as possible before hitting it hard with a quick, devastating rush. The clearing/securing method of advancement is generally done prior to or during the planting of the bomb at whichever site you are at. This generally means that everyone not planting the bomb checks all corners and hiding spots in the immediate vicinity of the site, followed by everyone getting in position to defend the site from all possible points of entry. A good rush includes all three methods of advancement. Now when your team is advancing, the best thing to do is have everyone check as many hiding spots as thoroughly as possible, and have the back man in the rush keep an eye on your rear as much as possible. Basically, just check as much as your method of advancement allows, i.e. a quick advance means you check very little where as a secure method means you check everything.   The ability to react and adapt to situations is probably the most defining element of a good, solid clan. The laws of physics can be applied to pretty much everything in real life, even CS. To every action in a match, you have to react to it. Every situation that unfolds gives you a choice of possible ways to adapt to it, each with their own eventual outcomes and consequences. The best way to think of this is to imagine a family tree. At the top, or beginning, you have a couple things you can do. As you move farther down, different groups of choices lead to their own groups of choices. This might seem a little complicated by the description, but rest assured it isn't as complex as it sounds. Anyways, let's say you have the given situation that you're playing as the CTs on de_dust2 and you're guarding bombsite B. If your teammates go down in bombsite A, then that means you are met with a situation you have to adapt to both as a team and as an individual. When this situation comes about, you have the choice to either try to enter the other site from the middle area or from the dark split-level hallway. You can enter the middle area via either the catwalk or the CT spawn and the hall by the catwalk. You have to take into account how many enemies are left, what guns they most likely have, where you think they will be in and around the bombsite, how many teammates you have left and their weapons, and the time you have left to defuse the bomb. The more you play, the more subconscious these decisions will come about. For most people, these come in about a couple of seconds, but as you progress as a clan it will be almost instantaneous. Most of this comes from logic and experience, however.
