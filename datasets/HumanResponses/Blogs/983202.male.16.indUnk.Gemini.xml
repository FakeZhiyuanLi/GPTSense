      GARR!R!!!!!!! Ok, in my german class today we had a sub. Which is pretty cool, he let us have a free period, but then some guy, I'll call him John just so no one yells at me, saw a flyer for the GSU meeting. So, he ripped it down. In seeing this, I said, "hey, I went to that meeting on wednesday" and then an arguement starts. This John guy actually says he "HATES GAYS" he has no problem with lesbians though. He only has a problem with lesbians who are in love, and gay guys. Then this one girl, who I'll call Jane, actually said that she wants put all gay people in concentration camps and basicly have a gay holocaust! Most homophobes I know say they actually aren't homophobes, they say they're ok with people being gay, but they think it's gross. These two people, John and Jane, seriously HATE gay people!!!! What the hell is wrong with people today? Ok, now I need to post lyrics to this one song by one of my top 3 favorite bands: SGR, it's called Hate and Despise: Hate & Despise   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Meet me in the street at 10 o’clock tonight  And I’ll tell you why these things that are going down just ain’t right  I can’t stand to see these people being treated like dogs  Being shut out of clubs like they were some type of hog  You say that packin’ heat makes you feel like the man  Well I’ll tell you right now, I’ll take you with my bare hands  It’s people like you that tear this country apart  And it’s people like me that take your hate to heart  So take my advice and open up your closed eyes  It doesn’t take a big man to hate and despise  Try and see everyone as being equal and free  Just give it a shot and see how easy it can be   Who the hell are you to judge what’s right?  Always trying to start a fight  How do you get to sleep at night  With your mind being shut so tight  You wonder why you’re all alone  Your fascist ways are set in stone  Just follow me I’ll show you brighter days  I’ll find a way to rid you of that   Hate! Hate! Hate!  That’s all you do  Fight! Fight! Fight!  Because you don’t like Jews  Kill ‘em! Kill ‘em!  If they’re black you better hope, hope, hope that they don’t fight back  If I had a darker hue would you hate me too?  You better run, run, run I’ll be coming after you  I’ll hit you, kick you while your down  Run your bigoted ass, out of this town.   Who the hell are you to judge what’s right?  Always trying to start a fight  How do you get to sleep at night  With your mind being shut so tight  You wonder why you’re all alone  Your fascist ways are set in stone  Just follow me I’ll show you brighter days  I’ll find a way to rid you of that   Bang! Bang! Bang!  Better shoot ‘em down  Damn those catholics for polluting this town  Move! Move! Move!  Italians please don’t stay  Can’t stand you or your greasy ways  What’s this I hear? You hate whites that like to fight?  Gays, Czechs, wanting there rights  Chinese, Japanese, all people too  Doesn’t make them any less just because they’re not you   Who the hell are you to judge what’s right?  Always trying to start a fight  How do you get to sleep at night  With your mind being shut so tight  You wonder why you’re all alone  Your fascist ways are set in stone  Just follow me I’ll show you brighter days  I’ll find a way to rid you of that hate   Who the hell are you to judge what’s right?  Always trying to start a fight  How do you get to sleep at night  With your mind being shut so tight  You wonder why you’re all alone  Your fucking ways are set in stone  Put your bats and guns and knives away  Maybe we can all get along someday      My favorite line in that song has to be "Doesn’t make them any less just because they’re not you" Why hate people because they're different? Gay people did NOTHING to hurt John and Jane, they're both just total idiots.   Ok, end rant.

      well, since I'm too lazy to do that project right now, I'm gonna post some lyrics! I just started really getting into this band, The Aquabats, and if you haven't heard them, download Powerded Milkman, Pizza Day, Playdough, or Super Rad. Right now I'm listening to Pizza Day, here are the lyrics:  Well I remember my first day at public school I was very scared of getting pummeled And sure enough I did at first recess I got pegged in the head by a big red ball It stung and my head hung Back to class with a bloody nose And soon it was lunchtime  Mom said I should ask about how poor kids can get fed So I got a book of tickets and a schedule and it read: Monday - Hot Dog, Tuesday - Taco Wednesday - Hamburgers and Chocolate Milk Thursday - Sloppy Joes and burritos in a bag Friday was Pizza Day, the best day of the week All the kids would line up super early just to eat  Monday - Hot Dog, Tuesday - Taco Wednesday - Hamburgers and Chocolate Milk Thursday - Sloppy Joes and burritos in a bag Friday was Pizza Day, the best day of the week It always came with salad and a side of cold green beans  Hooray for Pizza Day Hooray for Pizza Day I miss Pizza Day The best day of the week  Well, I remember my first day in Jr. High I had hairspray in my hair And my pants were way too tight And all the breakers and new wavers And the rockers and the preps Would all be in their places On the front lawn or the steps I hung out with some punker kids Who used to make me laugh I got thrown in the dumpster By some rich kids near the café  As time went on we figured out It was totally uncool To eat the welfare lunch Provided by the school So in poser-punker fashion We just mooched off all the kids And lived off eating candy bars And bags of nacho chips  Monday - Hot Dog, Tuesday - Taco Wednesday - Hamburgers and Chocolate Milk Thursday - Sloppy Joes and burritos in a bag Friday was Pizza Day, the best day of the week It always came with salad and a side of cold green beans  Hooray for Pizza Day Hooray for Pizza Day I miss Pizza Day The best day of the week  Well now I’m out of school And I don’t have a job (You’re a slob!) I just sit around all sweaty and lethargic And I’m just thinking ‘bout where it all went wrong Why I can’t concentrate On anything but reruns I wish I had some more stability I wish I had somebody making lunch for me I guess I miss the seventh grades in life The thought of Pizza Day I thought it was stupid then But I wish I had it now I miss my  Monday - Hot Dog, Tuesday - Taco Wednesday - Hamburgers and Chocolate Milk Thursday - Sloppy Joes and burritos in a bag Friday was Pizza Day, the best day of the week It always came with salad and a side of cold green beans  Hooray for Pizza Day Hooray for Pizza Day I miss Pizza Day The best day of the week!   Too bad the pizza at our school sucks ass... and they have it everyday.

      Well, got back from band practice about an hour ago, fun stuff. It started after the JV show yesturday, we practiced, then we went in Mike's basement and wrote songs.. fun stuff, I acted like such an idiot. Just about everything I said was completely idiotic. I'm used to it now. Then, after we all woke up and ate, we practed, and we ran around outside. Then everyone threw me (literally picked me up and threw me) around. It was fun. Then we drove around in Mike's go-cart and I got soaking wet... It was lots of fun.   Yeah, I'm really tired....

      About the being lonely thing... I probably would have a girlfriend now if I wasn't so picky... you know how it is when there's just one girl and because that girl exists, nobody is good enough.... *sighs* Well, I'm alive and I have friends and I'm not starving.... Life isn't that bad...

      Wow, so I was about to get really excited. They moved this Marching Band competition I was going to help at from Saturday and Sunday to Sunday and Monday. And Biocoogana (my band) was going to play a show then. Just remembered it was moved to sunday....   ugh... something good had better happen soon.

      I realized how amazing Rammstein is yesturday at band practice... Mike Ferroni showed me a video of them playing Ich Will and I freaked out... what an amazing song. I really like Mutter, that's gotta be my favorite so far...  Help! I'm turning into a metalhead! For some odd reason I can STILL recite The Call Of The Zombie from Rob Zombie: When out of the darkness, the zombie did call, true pain and suffering he brought to them all. Away ran the children to hide in their beds, for fear that the devil would chop off their heads! *instert evil girlish demonic laughter*  I've gotta lay off the metal...   By the way, report cards today! So happy! Only totally freaking not. Get ready for this, GPA=1.9.... Ugh... Class Rank=295/371. I hate being such a lazy little idiot.... so... um... There is no possible way I could go to the Ataris concert, one, because it's sold out, two because mommy and daddy aren't too happy about my grades either...  It'll get better... I'm also reminding myself I haven't had a girlfriend since August and I'm so lonely...   So Lonely by Sting. SGR does a great cover of it too....  Well someone told me yesterday That when you throw your love away You act as if you don't care You look as if you're going somewhere  But I just can't convince myself I couldn't live with no one else And I can only play that part And sit and nurse my broken heart  So lonely So lonely So lonely So lonely  Now no one's knocked upon my door For a thousand years or more All made up and nowhere to go Welcome to this one man show  Just take a seat they're always free No surprise no mystery In this theatre that I call my soul I always play the starring role  So lonely So lonely So lonely So lonely  Lonely, I'm so lonely I feel so alone I feel low I feel so Feel so low I feel low, low I feel low, low, low I feel low, low, low I feel low, low, low I feel low, low, low I feel low, low, low Low, I feel low I feel low I feel low I feel so lonely I feel so lonely I feel so lonely, lonely, lonely, lone Lonely, lone I feel so alone, yeah  So lonely

      I'd just like to add that John and Jane are both very nice people, and that other than their extreme homophobia they're nice.  They didn't ask me to say that, I did that myself because I didn't want people thinking John and Jane are jerkfaces...

      Well, it's Monday.... finally.... This weekend was a whole lot of work. If any of you have been to that stadium in Allentown, you'll understand why this was hell, because the stadium is a mountain...          Ok, Saturday: I started out in the ticket booth in the top right. Nobody came so they eventually shut it down... after 3 hours... Kaitlynn came to talk to me a couple times, and then I talked to the security guard a little bit. His name is AJ and he kinda talks funny, he says things like "Are they intamissin'?" and he has the typical white guy cop mustache. OK, after that I hung out at the LVK booth, and I talked to Glen and found out they put "No baggy pants" in the drum corps handbook, meaning I need to go shopping for pants. After THAT I sat with Kaitlynn and talked, she had to run airgrams to the field a couple times, because that's what she was suposed to be doing. She had to leave a bit early, (3:30). Her whole family had to leave which meant there were 4 open spaces. I took her sister Holly's job. I had to run up and down the Allentown hill to give candygrams to the bands. At my dinner break, me and this kid John switched jobs, and I got to hand out flyers to the bands, which involves a lot of sitting and waiting, but at least it wasn't running up and down the hill. Then this guy Floyd moved me to the instant video booth and I helped make tape boxes, put tapes in boxes, and strap names to boxes with another guy named Tyler. That was the best job I had all night, because I didn't have to move around a lot, and I wasn't bored out of my mind. Then I left, and got home around 12.         Next Day: I got there at 9 like Saturday, and nothing much was happening, so I walked around and talked to Glen and the LVK people. Then around 11:38 I got my job. Running airgrams which is what Kaitlynn did on Saturday. That involves running up and down the STAIRS there... which is worse than the hill. So I did that for around  3 hours!!!  then once durring my 3 hours of hell, I was sitting down enjoying the show when I looked up and Kaitlynn was there! She wasn't going to go, but her dad said that they could. So that was nice. So I talked to her for a while. Then we both got reassigned (she didn't have a job then) and her sister Danielle took my job, I kinda made her do that so I could talk to Kaitlynn, the director of YEA! (Ray) kinda guess that after I made Danielle take my job, so he moved Kaitlynn somewhere else so she wouldn't be a distraction. Ted and his mom came down to replace her, and that was cool, Ted's a cool guy. So I had someone to talk to. (By the way, right then I was working at the main ticket booth). So after a couple hours this girl walked by with an Operation Ivy sweatshirt and plaid pants on. So I said "Nice Shirt!" and I told her about meeting Jesse Michaels. So that was cool, and a couple hours later she came down and talked to me for a couple hours. She's a cool person, too bad she lives in another state, as does Kaitlynn. So, she had to go check in with the people she was with for a while, and at about 8:45 they closed the main gate's ticket boothes and such, so me and my dad both didn't have anything to do (He worked in a ticket selling booth for both days all day because they have outlets in them so he can plug his computer up and do work) so we left. I got home really early (around 10:05ish) and I got a good nights sleep.         Today: Well, first I woke up at 7 because all the pillows fell off my bed, so I put them back on and went back to sleep. At around 7:45 my dad woke me up for the Veterns Day parade. So I ate, put on my full band uniform and such and went with my dad and Erin (my sister) to band. We get there around 8:45ish... and we get all ready. Then, at 9:01 Mr. Snydog (I just have to call him that because it's the stupidest nickname I've ever heard for him) told us that the parade was canceled. So, everyone was mad because they could all be sleeping now. I wouldn't have minded doing the parade, it's just a little parade, then I wouldn't have had to wake up for nothing. Then we all went home and I realized that was a keen time to shower, then I sat around in a extra small plain white t-shirt, and green plaid pajamas the whole day and here I am at 9:21... still in an extra small plain white t-shirt and green plaid pajamas. I'm so lazy... but I did practice and do my homework, so it's not that bad... My sister showed me this great site! It's called http://www.evolvefish.com/ and it's got all these neet buttons and pins. Some of them I don't really agree with, a lot of it's darwin, athiest, anti-religion, anti-god stuff, but there's some good stuff there. I ordered 3 buttons, one says "Straight But Not Narrow" which my granny has her purse (I love my family), another one that says "Don't Believe Everything You're Told" and another one that's just a peace sign. I can't wait to get them and put them on my backpack for my german class. And just for general walking around school. I love my backpack, it's got all this liberal propaganda on it. It's good. So, um... it's 9:26 now and I'm strangely tired... so I'm off now, bye.

      Well, I haven't updated this in a while so... here we go:  A guy from drum corps (Andrew) had to stay with us this weekend. His flight was canceled because of the snow, so we took him in. My dad eventually drove him half way home (He lives in Virginia) and he's not back yet, he's staying in a hotel up there. Drum Corps was fun, the music for the show is: Firebird (which is amazing, I photo copied the Marima 2 part from Andrew, so I'm learning both parts from the score music we got), Carnival of the Animals, Ave Maria, and Pines of Rome. For some ungodly reason, whenever I search for any piece of classical music, the filesharing idiots say it's by Mozart of Beethoven. Even Pachebel's Canon in D Major! They said it's by Mozart! But it's Johann Pachebel of course, hence the Pachebel... yeah...  Well, Firebird is soo cool and the Marimba parts sound amazing. Especially with the timpani part... Our timpanist played the contra part on the timpani. It was amazing, he played the melody of Firebird on one timpani, and it right too!  I've been less emo lately, this is a good thing...   I can't wait until March 1st! The Biocoogana set is going to kick ass, they're a great band. I think I'll pee myself or something when they play Receptive View. They have a new song but I haven't heard it really, suposedly it's good. Just look at some of the lyrics to Receptive View. Bite the bullet, hold it back One swift movement turns your view to black Stalking conscience the incision brings  Days progress that reminder stings I know your hurting but you gotta see me through Theres so may people that honestly love you  There's this one part in the song that starts out with just bass, and Steve plays this solo, and it's amazing... you should ALL go to the concert because Biocoogana is so damn good.  Ok, 5 Seconds to Go changed it's name to the LOL's. Just so ya know.  um, there's lots of snow, and I hate snow...

      Ok, well, it's been a couple months since I updated this, I think I'll TRY and get into the habit... ok... a couple things. www.tjmonkeys.com is the funniest site ever. Read Porter's stuff, he freaking rocks. Here's a little sample, because who knows if you'll actually go to the site...  On Baby Doll T-shirts:  I don't like girls in baby doll t-shirts.   Apparently, these girls care about clothes so much, fashion is so important to them...that they're willing to beat up defenseless babies and take their tiny shirts.   It's sick. Sick, sick, sick.   So whenever I see a crying baby with no shirt on, I nod knowingly.   And whenever I see a girl in a baby doll t-shirt, I shake my head in disgust.   I also probably check her out when she's not looking.   by Porter

         ho ho ho! I love Non-Sequitor...   What's new in the life of Brian? Not much, not much at all. I'm just sitting here listening to Russian Christmas Music, and waiting for the band trip, screw spring break, I'm just going to be bored, I want my band trip. Last night I memorized the pit feature in Carnival of the Animals, and I got it up to tempo. I could still use some work on hitting the right notes, and for some reason, there's this pattern that goes 16th16th8th, and the 8th note at the end always sounds cut off. I also need to practice it on a set of vibes, because I really need to work on pedeling... I think today I'll get the pit feature in Firebird down and up to speed, which might be next to impossible, because I go from the meledy to these chords really fast, and it's really hard to hit the right notes.  Well, I think I'm going to be bored out of my skull for spring break, I need a good set of vibes, a 5 1/2 octive marimba... maybe a nice set of orcestra bells, and chimes, just for fun. I could do without chimes, and maybe without the bells, but I would love vibes and a marimba... if anyone wants to, you know, give me a marimba, or a vibraphone for my birthday, I'd love you forever and ever. I wonder if I'd have room.... Also, if you could soundproof my room, I'd dig that too. So then I could practice at 2 in the morning if I wanted. Oh! And I could clean up my room, and move the drum set up there too, so I could practice all day and all night.... I'd be a freakin' god by the end of the year... Now, let's put it this way, if you don't do any of those things for me for my birthday, you'll be contributing to me NOT being amazing, this all rests on your shoulders people!   Remember I said this, and START SAVING!

      Ok, new idea. Doesn't it suck when you get dumped? Especially because when you get dumped, they dumper just goes on their marry little way, life is great and everything's super. But for the dumped, it sucks, especially if you really liked the person. Now, that's not fair, so I propose that after you dump someone, it's legal to bleed them in whatever way you think is appropriate... This would also cut back on meaningless relationships, because people would be so afraid of being bled.. they wouldn't get into relationships they knew they would just leave eventually, it would probably cut down on the divorce rate too... Listen to me people, and we can create a new and better world...

      Alright.... I just got back from my section 'bout 20 minutes ago... has anyone realize how fucking hot it is outside??? It's in the 80's! THE 80's! What happened to the 60's and 70's... That's what spring should be, this is just too hot. Other than that, I'm pretty chill. Just listening to The Commercials, who rock so hard. I went to Nifty Fifty's last night, it was pretty fun... then last night I fell asleep at 3 because it's too hot.... So.. this is a waste of my time, I should be doing homework.

      So, it's a lazy monday morning, and I'm pretty bored. I just did my homework for the day... I can't wait until the band trip to Florida! All I really need to do that's constructive today is practice for a half an hour, I think I'll practice Firebird today.   Ok,  urlLink BROKEN SAINTS!   Dear fucking god almighty... I just saw chapter 23 and wow... words can't describe how freaking amazing it was... They had this intro to the chapter, where they played off of the scene in Donnie Darko when he gets the steak knife and stabs at where Frank is when he's in the bathroom, and it does the ripple thing... which was great, and then the rest of the chapter is just creepy as hell and amazing. I can't wait until they do the DVD package thing...

      So, remember how happy I was? No... not anymore.  It's raining, it feels right it should rain. I don't want to go to Drum Corps with every fiber of my being. There's no one online I can talk to, and the one person I need to talk to isn't home. I need a break.   LFD played at Earthfest, we sucked. Biocoogana played at Earthfest too, and I WAS the crowd, I was the only one skanking... I felt like a jackass but it was still fun. That was the best thing that happened to me all week, and that wasn't even too great. I mean, they played great, but I need more people to bump into when I'm skanking.  So, I think I'm going to runaway... I'm gonna go lock the door to my room, and listen to The Get Up Kids and The Early November, in the dark of course, and knit myself a sweater... then I'll eventually cry myself a real river, and then I'll drown. Super, eh? No, it's not as bad as making me want to die. But I do want a change, a change for the better. For some reason my happiness comes in about 3 weeks to 1 month packages. I guess I've used up my package. I have this feeling that it's going to get worse. I would normally get all emo and stupid to someone privitely, but I just can't find anyone right now. Send me some positive energy people.. I could use it, anything. I mean, it could get a lot worse, and I have a feeling it will get worse. Someone, prove me wrong... Please.   I hate to sound so annoying, I know there are people who are feeling worse than I am. And it's nothing too big on the grand scale of things. It's just many, three or four things combined with who I am. If you knew what was bothering me, you'd probably laugh, and say, cheer up emo kid! And to the other things... We all get bad grades sometimes, everyone's insecure at your age, and sometimes, music just doesn't come together the way you want it to. Well, to one of them, I'm not always insecure, I went a good long month feeling super, and now I'm doubleplusungood. I've felt worse... I don't know, I'm just babbeling for lack of a better outlet. Know what? On second thought, I'll live without the positive energy, there are other people who need it way more than I do. I'm just being emo.  You could... get me really sick so I wouldn't have to go to drum corps.. if you did that you'd be my hero forever.

      So, I'm grounded for the next 4 weeks. I'm failing two classes, so the punnishment, or the consequence rather, is understandable. My birthday was yesturday, so, this computer time is my birthday present. I got a lot of good stuff for my birthday, and at drum corps, I got a cake and everyone sang happy birthday to me, and the new mallets came in. They're really great, the marimba ones are pretty heavy, and the vibe ones are light, but the heads are kinda large. I also got a pair of xylophone mallets I ordered last year. We worked on Ave Maria for mostly all of Saturday, which was great, because it is such a beautiful song. My part is so great, I roll chords with four mallets for just about the whole song, and I have these beautiful 16th note runs at the end. So, that was fun.  I've been reading Les Miz in my spare time. The first day I started reading, I got a couple of great quotes from the Bishop M. Myriel, who is now one of my favorite fictional characters.  "Death belongs to God alone. By what right do men touch that unkown thing?" - page 24 and "Ecclesiastes names thee Almighty; Maccabees names thee creator; the Epistle to Ephesians names thee Liberty; Baruch names thee Immensity; the Psalms name thee Wisdom and Truth; John names thee Light Providence; Leviticus, Holiness; Esdras, Justice; Creation calls thee God; man names thee Father; but Solomon names thee Compassion, and that is the most beautiful of all thy names." page 27.  If you're not religious, that probably means nothing to you, but oh well. I really agree with what the Bishop says here, I like to think that God is compassion.

      I was officially dubbed ungrounded today, which is great. Today I'm gonna head up to Biocoogana practice, haven't been to one of their practices in a while. That should be fun, I need to skank.   Things are looking up and going great.  I'm listening to an MP3 of an LVK run-through, sounds damn nice. I can't wait until it sounds better. The end of Firebird is a trainwreck. The pit needs to look up and/or listen back a lot better. The end of Ave Maria gives me chills everytime I listen to it, sooo  good.  So, what else is there? I read a few books whilst I was grounded. I read Fight Club, which was great, but got me thinking really violently. It's a great book to read to see inside the mind of someone who's very not like me. After that I read Clockwork Orange, which I liked. It took me a chapter or two to understand the slang. That had a less depressing ending, I liked that. After THAT I read Sirens of Titan, which was sad, but still good.  I took my last finals today, Social Studies wasn't too bad, Science... just no... Mr. Doc is a horrible teacher. We didn't learn half the stuff on that test.  I'm gonna miss all the people at school, but I think all the people I actually want to see I will see, and all the people I don't want to see, I won't see, so that's a nice way to look at it. But I won't see the people I want to see as much, which is kinda eh.  I think that's it for now.

      I'm going to see a movie soon, then, next morning, off to drum corps for 5 days, super great.  I leave you with this.   don't break too many hearts. don't take too many arrows in the chest. cry comfortably, let us all know what you're thinking. is there a gesture i could use to clearly express i'm at an utter loss for words? is there a part of you that's torn? that's larger than life? that'll hold on for one more night? i've got a speech to make. followed by a big parade. northside. closed eyes. all charades go on forever. hands tied with fools pride. in a slowly fleeing summer. just throw your hands up at the sky. no use trying to explain this. the clouds are mirrors. i'm disguised. i'm not all that entertaining. the city looks the same until you notice smaller changes. it still knows us all by name. it holds us close to its heart (now repeat) all my hopes are unaligned. this diagnosis is self-designed. northside. closed eyes. all charades go on forever. ands tied with fools pride. in a slowly fleeing summer. empty rooms don't have pictures to talk to. brickwall views demand uninspired afternoons. the days are flooding into months. the nights are staring into centuries. i've got some older pictures of people i see once every couple years. intrigued or unamazed. "you were so much different back in those days."  and now this smile has a bitter curve. now these eyes are unenchanted. and all we see is a faded image of what we used to be. how can we relate when we don't know a thing about each other anymore? is there a gesture i could use to clearly express i'm at an utter loss for words.

      Let's post some useful information for some of my more impulsive friends...    Most of you know what alcohol looks like, how it is packaged, and how it makes you feel. Perhaps something you didn't know is that alcohol is a drug. Its scientific name is ethyl alcohol and it is classified as a depressant, the same drug class as a barbiturate or tranquilizer. Alcohol is unique because it is legal for adults to buy and drink and is widely accepted in our culture. In fact, alcohol is the most popular drug among youth and adults in our country.  Sadly, alcohol is also one of the most deadly drugs available to our youth today. The leading cause of death among teens in this country is alcohol-related traffic accidents. Alcohol also causes heart disease, high blood pressure, liver damage, brain damage, and many other health problems.  Once alcohol is absorbed into the blood stream, it acts upon the central nervous system like a depressant, affecting speech, vision, and coordination. The physical effects of alcohol depend on many factors, including the amount of alcohol consumed over time, the emotional state and body weight of the drinker, the concentration of the drink, and the amount of food in the stomach at the time of consumption.  Smaller doses of alcohol may cause euphoria and a mild relaxed feeling. Intoxication occurs when higher doses are taken. Responses to higher doses of alcohol are varied: it may make some people feel more outgoing and giddy, while others will feel depressed, aggressive, or hostile. Physical responses to increased doses of alcohol include altered perception, impaired judgment, loss of coordination, staggered walk, blurred vision, bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. An overdose of alcohol can cause unconsciousness, respiratory failure, and death.  Alcohol is an addictive drug. The medical term for this addiction is called alcoholism. Research suggests that alcoholism may be a genetic predisposition, and that a child of an alcoholic parent runs many times the risk of becoming an alcoholic. Alcoholism strikes all age groups; about ten percent of the population will develop the disease.     This isn't in the article, but if you are under the age of 18-20, your nervous system isn't fully developed. Drinking alcohol before you're 18-20 can and will perminately fuck your nervous system up. It screws with the coating on the outside of pathways, and perminately effects your judgement.   Tobacco is used in many forms, including cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, and snuff. Cigarettes are the most common type of tobacco used by teens, followed by chewing tobacco and snuff. Studies of school age children indicate that initiation of daily smoking (not occasional use) is highest among junior high school students (about ages 12-14).  Many harmful ingredients in tobacco, such as nicotine, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen cyanide are absorbed into the body through the lungs. Nicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco, is so toxic that it has been used as an insecticide.  Tobacco acts both as a stimulant and a depressant. A beginning smoker will experience euphoria, lightheadedness, giddyness, dizziness, elevated heartbeat and respiration rates, and a tingling sensation in the hands and feet. A chronic smoker will suffer from a diminished sense of smell and taste.  Not everyone who begins smoking will become addicted; however, when users give up smoking, withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, nervousness, sleeplessness, sweating, reduced heart rate and blood pressure, inability to concentrate, compulsive eating, headaches, and irritability can occur. These physical withdrawal symptoms last for about one to three weeks.  Medical problems associated with smoking tobacco are normally the result of long-term use. Some of the many health hazards of tobacco are heart disease, cancer, lung disease, obstructive pulmonary and bronchial disease, gum and jawbone deterioration, gastrointestinal disease, eating disorders, and allergic reactions. The use of smokeless tobacco, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, can be as dangerous as smoking, causing mouth lesions and cancer.    Also, smoking is fucking disgusting, not to mention pointless and stupid.   Methamphetamines    Methamphetamine is sold in pill or powder form, and can be swallowed, inhaled, or injected  Methamphetamines and amphetamines are also highly addictive and dangerous stimulants. Commonly referred to as uppers and speed, these drugs are sold in powder, pill, and capsule forms that can be inhaled through the nose, swallowed, or injected.  Like cocaine and crack, the physical effects of methamphetamines and amphetamines are in creased alertness, euphoria, appetite loss, dilated pupils, elevated heart rate, increased respiration, and elevated body temperature. Prolonged use of these drugs can cause blurred vision, dizziness, loss of coordination, and collapse. An overdose can result in high blood pressure, fever, stroke, and heart failure.  The most popular of the two drugs are methamphetamines, commonly called speed, meth, crank, crystal, or crystal meth or in its smokable form, ice, glass or crystal. Methamphetamines are usually found in powder form in colors ranging from white to tan, and can be swallowed, inhaled through the nose, or injected. It is sold in small plastic or paper packets or plastic bags. The paraphernalia associated with inhaling the drug are razor blades, mirrors, straws, and rolled dollar bills; the paraphernalia associated with injecting the drug include syringes, spoons, and surgical tubing, bandanas, or a belt used to constrict the vein.    Now that's just fucking stupid.   Smoking Cannabis produces almost instant effects, lasting one to four hours. Cannabis makes people relaxed and talkative, but is a depressant, which can make people who are sad feel worse. Sound and colours also become more intense. Users typically report that Cannabis improves self-awareness, relationships with others and makes them more “easy going”, tolerant and understanding. Some users say that it helps them to be creative. In the short term Cannabis hinders concentration and slows reaction times, so is a dangerous drug when using machinery or driving. High doses can cause hallucinations and other sensory problems.Nausea and vomiting can occur, especially if inexperienced users take too much. The effects the following day are often less than after heavy drinking - no headaches or nausea, just a “woolly-head”.  Death is unknown except from accidents.However, 140,000 people are admitted to US hospitals every year because of Cannabis abuse, mainly with mental health problems.That’s one in every 140 users. Physical dependency does not occur, but smoking it in tobacco will of course result in nicotine addiction.  Some brain cell surfaces have receptors that fit THC, which mimics a naturally occurring brain substance called anandamide,   Within minutes of taking Cannabis, these receptors fire up, sending an urgent message to the nucleus of each cell, switching on the genes which tell the cell how to make more receptors.So the first dose may not produce much effect, with few receptors to be activated, but the following ones may be very different.  Now we can see why twins are often similar in their preference for a drug like Cannabis - enjoyment is partly in the genes.Other important factors include the mental state of the person before they take the drug, their expectations and the setting in which the drug is taken.   There have been a number of studies on the longer term effects of Cannabis, some find significant differences, others do not. The trouble is it all depends on what you are looking for.The truth is that long term Cannabis effects are subtle and easily missed – but they are there all the same.In view of the very large numbers of regular Cannabis users, even subtle effects need to be taken seriously.After all, what is the effect of a single cigarette or of smoking for a year?It is the possible cumulative effect in a population of hundreds of thousands of young and older users over a decade or more that requires the closes scrutiny.   Scientists have studied electrical activity in the frontal lobes of the brain in Cannabis users using event-related potential measurements (ERP).You can measure not only patterns of electrical activity in the brain using electrodes placed over the head, but also the speed of brain reactions to - say - a picture or a sound.  Research shows that with increased length of use, Cannabis users are less able to focus attention and filter out irrelevant stimuli, (frontal lobe activity).However with increasing frequency of use there was a growing problem in the parietal area of the brain with slower speed of information processing.  For example, a 35 year old man who had been taking Cannabis every day for eighteen years was monitored during six weeks of withdrawal. Brain event-related potential (ERP) measures of selective attention showed that he had problems filtering out complex irrelevant information. THC is fat soluble and stored widely in the body, taking several weeks to disappear completely, however the changes persisted even when Cannabis levels in the body were undetectable after six weeks of abstinence.  The man was allowed to take some more Cannabis, and his ERPalmost returned to normal.In other words, there is some evidence that people who are regularly stoned, require some THC levels in the brain for “normal” function in some mental tasks. Some problems in thinking may actually improve when a chronic user is slightly under the influence.But effects of Cannabis can last a very long time.  This “recovery” effect when intoxicated is not uncommon.Some musicians report that work they create when drunk or stoned can only be recovered fully when they perform in the same mental state that they were in originally.  There have been many suggestions that schizophrenia could be triggered by use of Cannabis.There is no evidence for this but good reason for the link in people’s minds. Schizophrenia is a condition affecting around 1% of the population in the course of a lifetime, and is usually chronic, treatable but relapsing.However schizophrenia is often confused with drug-induced psychosis. By the law of probabilities the two events sometimes occur more or less at the same time- psychosis and onset of schizophrenia - as one would expect when both drug-taking and schizophrenia are relatively common.  Acute mental illness caused by Cannabis is a common cause of hospital admission.   In many cases it is hard to separate the effects of different drugs that the user has been taking.The combined effect is often an acute psychotic state indistinguishable from many other mental disorders.The diagnosis may only become clear when the person who is unwell reveals the full history of what they have tried and when. The difference from other diagnoses is that drug-induced hallucinations, delusions and distortions disappear with abstinence from drugs.  Cannabis use in pregnancy carries similar risks to smoking tobacco - from the tobacco used. It can also affect male sexual development in some cases (unusual).Cannabis has a depressant effect on the immune system through direct effects on white cells.It can also slow healing.Regular Cannabis smoking is linked to bronchitis and other chest problems, and possibly lung cancer.One to three Cannabis joints a day can cause as much lung damage as smoking five times a many cigarettes.The way smokers inhale increases the effects on the lung.  Cannabis in combination with cocaine causes a particularly high rise in blood pressure and heart rate - typically a rise of 49 beats per minute combined compared to around 30 with either alone.Users taking both before exercising are placing an additional strain on their hearts.   I hope everyone who read this learned something. I hate to be like, "Health class" and everything, but seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you people. You're wasting your already short life on fake happiness that just fucks you in the end. I know you just want to think about the here and now, "Drink and be marry for tomorrow we die" kind of mentality. That's just stupid. I can have lots of fun when I'm not fucked up, how do I know? Because I've had fun. Hiding from your problems through drugs and alcohol isn't solving anything, once you come back down from your high, you're still in the same shit you were in before. Maybe you think there's nothing to do here. Maybe you've got that, "god I hate this stupid suburban town" attitude. Maybe you don't think we have enough freedom? Not really, I live in a nice suburban area. It's also in walking distance of a train... if I got really bored I could always get some friends and take the train to somewhere more fun. Do I need to be stoned to have fun? Not at all. Some people say to me, "Brian, you don't really live." but, is that true? The happiness I have is genuine. The fun I have isn't influenced by chemicals or herbs. I think people just need to face the facts. There is life without alcohol, drugs, and all that other shit. I know some people might have seriously bad lives, and they use alcohol as an escape. Now, I admit, I'd rather they do that than kill themselves, but there are other things you could do. You could run away from home for example. Stay at a friends house. While you're there, write your parents and have a serious discussion. Tell them how you feel. Unless your parents are huge fucking idiots, they might listen. Now, if it's just petty stuff like they won't let you watch tv at 1 in the morning, or they make you eat your vegetables... go fuck yourself, seriously. I'm sure you have a great life, you're just too stupid to understand it. I know this might just be your "teen rebellion" coming out, and it'll pass once you grow up, but I'd like to see you grow up. I don't want to find out you were drunk and then you accidentally fell in a river or something stupid like that.   Have a nice day.

      I still haven't slept.... I'm off to corps, I leave you with this.   The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot by Brand New  If it makes you less sad, I will die by your hand. I hope you find out what you want. I already know what I am. And if it makes you less sad, we'll start talking again. And you can tell me how vile I already know that I am. I'll grow old and start acting my age. I'll be a brand new day in a life that you hate. A crown of gold. A heart that's harder than stone. And it hurts a whole lot, but it's missed when it's gone. Call me a safe bet. I'm betting I'm not. I'm glad that you can forgive. I'm only hoping as time goes, you can forget. If it makes you less sad, I'll move out of the state. You can keep to yourself. I'll keep out of your way. And if it makes you less sad, I'll take your pictures all down. Every picture you paint, I will paint myself out. It's cold as a tomb, and it's dark in your room, when I sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wounds. So call it quits or get a grip. Say you wanted a solution. You just wanted to be missed. Call me a safe bet. I'm betting I'm not. I'm glad that you can forgive. I'm only hoping as time goes, you can forget... You are calm and reposed. Let your beauty unfold. Pale white, like the skin stretched over your bones. Spring keeps you ever close. You are second hand smoke. You are so fragile and thin. Standing trial for your sins. Holding onto yourself the best you can. You are the smell before rain. You are the blood in my veins. Call me a safe bet. I'm betting I'm not. I'm glad that you can forgive. I'm only hoping as time goes, you can forget

      If anyone is reading this at the time I am posting this, there is something fucking wrong with you... go away and keep sleeping you stupid fuck! That's where I would be if I wasn't so filled with insomnia.   Nugggghghhhhh  Fuck, I was going to say something... oh yeah!  Buy me things  like this   urlLink Caffeine SOAP    urlLink ENERGIZING GEL!    urlLink Caffeine GUM!   and that soda that's like... fucking amazing... Phil was drinking it on the bus.. it was a Cola... whatever it was called, get me some of that shit. It's amazing. I took one drink and woke up, and caffeine rarely effects me.

      Yeah, so last night I got off the computer at like, 2:30 something or whatever... I go in my room and watch tv.... for a long time, and I tried to go to sleep, I really did. So then I decided to watch Donnie Darko with director and actors commentary... well, now it's 9:10, and I haven't slept yet... I'm so fucking tired... I really should've slept, but I think I'll go down to the deli for lunch and grab an Amp or something like that... fuck I need money first... Where am I going to find money? I looked in all my pants pockets this morning before the sun came up kind of morning... and I found pencils and tissues... what shit... I should find fucking CASH.   Ok, just found out plans from the Sis. Megan's coming over to pick us up and see Pirates of the Carribean at like, 11:30, so I'll get someone to give me money then, and we'll stop by the Deli and I'll get an amp... SHIT! WE SHOULD GO TO STARBUCKS! That would kick ass... I would have no idea what to get, the only time I ever get a coffee thing is when someone else has it. I think the last time I had a coffee thing was back at the last Bio practice, and Mike had this cold coffee drinky thing.. and before that it was like... last year when Amy let me have some of her... whatever it was... That was all good stuff... I'd be afraid to get like, coffee coffee.... 'cause it's all like, strong and I'd be afraid to fuck it up or something... Anyhoo, I need some caffeine....  Know what's going to be super kick ass? DRUM CORPS TODAY! I swear, the second I set my bed out I'm going out like a fucking light... I hope the Amp or whatever I get is enough to wake me up for POTC... Fuck, why is everything funny when you're tired? I just saw POT in POTC and I actually laughed.... fizuck... Who needs sleep? Pah.

      Ah Brand New... I just went out and bough their new cd, along with The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most by Dashboard Confessional.   "The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot"  If it makes you less sad, I will die by your hand. I hope you find out what you want. I already know what I am. And if it makes you less sad, we'll start talking again. And you can tell me how vile I already know that I am. I'll grow old and start acting my age. I'll be a brand new day in a life that you hate. A crown of gold. A heart that's harder than stone. And it hurts a whole lot, but it's missed when it's gone. Call me a safe bet. I'm betting I'm not. I'm glad that you can forgive. I'm only hoping as time goes, you can forget. If it makes you less sad, I'll move out of the state. You can keep to yourself. I'll keep out of your way. And if it makes you less sad, I'll take your pictures all down. Every picture you paint, I will paint myself out.

I'm only hoping as time goes, you can forget.   I think my favorite part from that is "You are the smell before rain. You are the blood in my veins." Think, the smell before rain... that's beautiful.

      Bright Eyes, just amazing...   A Line Allows Progress, A Circle Does Not  sitting around, no work today try pacing to keep awake laying around, no school today just drink until the clock has circled all the way it is late afternoon as you walk through the rooms of a house that is quiet except for unanswered telephones you stand near the sink while you're mixing a drink you think you don't want to pass out where your roommates will find you again stumble around the neighborhood with nothing to do you're always looking for something to sniff, smoke, or swallow calling over next door to see what they got but you would settle for anything that would make your brain slow down or stop break this circle of thoughts you chase before the catch back up with you and your parents noticied your thinning face, all the weight you lost all the weight you are losing you said, "i'm done feeling like a skeleton no more sleep walking dead" you're going to wake from this coma you're going to crawl from this bed you have made and stop counting on that camera that hangs round your neck because it won't ever remember what you choose to forget as you try to find some source of light try to name one thing you like you used to have such a longer list and light you never had to look for it but now it's so easy to second guess everything you do until all you want is to finish this half empty glass before the ice melts away this feeling used to pass but seems like it's every day and every night now

      Know what? I really don't like it when people have really strict opinions of the world, and they think their opinion is fact. Like, let's say there's someone who says, "Life is horrible, there is no reason for anyone to live." I don't think so, for them, that's how it might be, but life in general can not be horrible. Just the fact that I have a different opinion proves them wrong. Some people might think that all people are manipulative and think very selfishly, and they decide that is fact. I think differently, I think SOME people think that way, but I don't, and lots of people I know don't, therefore proving them wrong. I think that the Hindu story about the 3 blind men and the elephant accurately describes how life is in general. Everyone sees a small piece of the bigger picture. Every thought anyone has thought came from something that's "right".  Like racism, racist people are correct in realizing that yes, the color of their skin IS different. Now, in my opinion, where they went wrong is how they acted on that.  Just thought I'd let that all out.

      Well, recently I've been getting into Brand New, thought I'd just post some lyrics I liked.  The No Seatbelt Song   So, it's sad that doesn't suit you now. And me fresh out of rope... Please ignore this lisp, I never meant to sound like this. So take me and break me and make me strong like you. I'll be forever grateful to this and you. It's only you, beautiful. Or I don't want anyone. If I can choose it's only you. Fix me to a chain around your neck and wear me like a nickel. Even new wine served in old skins will cheapen the taste. I shot the pilot, now I'm begging you to fly this for me. I'm here for you to use, broken and bruised. Do you understand? It's only you, beautiful. Or don't want anyone. If I can choose, it's only you. But how could I miscalculate... perfect eyes will have perfect aim. If I can choose, it's only you. "We're wrecking" and I'm dry like a drum... so fine I'll leave... we're spent... take our time... measured... we slave for days. It's only you, beautiful. Or I don't want anyone. If I can choose. It's only you. But how could I miscalculate... perfect lies from a perfect dame. If I can choose... it's only you.

      Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get — only what you are expecting to give — which is everything. What you will receive in return varies. But it really has no connection with what you give. You give because you love and cannot help giving.  - Katharine Hepburn

      I've been reading Les Misérables again, I found this quote when I was on the bus at corps.  "The day is vulgar," said he, "and only deserves closed shutters. People who are anybody light up their wit when the zenith lights up its stars." -M. Luke Esprit Gillenormand. Page 600.  After spending days in the hot sun, you really start to love the night. Nothing beautiful happens in the heat of the day. Stars are beautiful, a sunset is beautiful. The only exception is a sunrise. Nobody can argue that a blaring hot sun is more beautiful than a sky full of stars.

      Back from another corps weekend... it wasn't too bad, it was pretty fun. Practice today before ensambling was great. One we starting ensambling it all sucked, our last run through was complete shit. But, it happens, I'll just be practicing a lot this week.  In like, 8th grade, Caitlin F. told me about this band, Bright Eyes, so I downloaded some of their stuff, and I was like, yeah this is pretty cool, but didn't listen to it too much. So, recently Vicki's been getting into them, so I pulled out those songs again, and now I love it. There's this one song, "No Lies, Just Love", and the lyrics are amazing.   It was in the march of the winter I turned seventeen That I bought those things I thought I would need And I wrote a letter to my family Said it's not your fault And you've been good to me It's just lately I've been feeling Like I don't belong Like the ground's not mine to walk upon And I've heard that music Echo through the house Where my grandmother drank By herself And I sat watching a flower As it was withering I was embarrassed by its honesty So I'd prefer to be remembered as a smiling face Not this fucking wreck That's taken its place  So please forgive what I have done No you can't stay mad at the setting sun Cause we all get tired, I mean eventually There is nothing left to do but sleep  But spring came bearing sunlight Those persuasive rays So I gave myself a few more days My salvation it came, quite suddenly When Justin spoke very plainly He said "Of course it's your decision, But just so you know, If you decide to leave, Soon I will follow"  I wrote this for a baby Who has yet to be born My brother's first child I hope that womb's not too warm Cause it's cold out here And it'll be quite a shock To breathe this air To discover loss So I'd like to make some changes Before you arive So when your new eyes meet mine They won't see no lies Just love. Just love.  I will be pure No, no, I know I will be pure Like snow, like gold Like snow, like gold Like snow, like snow Like gold, like gold, like gold

      More Brand New that's just amazing...  Guernica  Ever since I was young your word is the word that always won.  Worry and wake the ones you love.  A phone call I'd rather not receive.  Please use my body while I sleep.  My lungs are fresh and yours to keep,  Kept clean and they will let you breathe.   Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry?  I am the watch you always wear but you forget to wind.   Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these,  so I sat alone and waited out the night.  The best part of what has happened was the part I must have missed.  So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around.   I'm not writing my goodbyes.  I submit no excuse.  If this is what I have to do I owe you every day I wake.  If I could I would shrink myself and sink through your skin to your blood cells  and remove whatever makes you hurt but I am too weak to be your cure.   Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry?  I am the watch you always wear but you forget to wind.   Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these,  so I sat alone and waited out the night.  The best part of what has happened was the part I must have missed.  So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around.   I'm not writing my goodbyes.  I'm not letting you check out.  You will beat this starting now and you will always be around.  I'm there to monitor your breathing  I will watch you while you're sleeping.  I will keep you safe and sound.  Does anybody remember back when you were very young.  Did you ever think that you would be this blessed?

      I got back from the shore a while ago, it was fun. Last night we saw this acoustic emo band playing on one of the sidewalks, I got them to play San Dimas Highschool Football Rules by the Ataris, and The Swiss Army Romance by Dashboard Confessional. They're called The Kids Club, check them out.

      "As Lovers Go"  She said, "I've gotta be honest, you're wasteing your time if you're fishing round here." And I said, "You must be mistaken, because I'm not fooling, this feeling is real" She said...She said, "You've gotta be crazy, what do you take me for, some kind of easy mind?" You've got wits...You've got looks, You've got passion but I swear that you've got me all wrong.  all wrong. all wrong. but you got me...  I'll be true, I'll be useful... I'll be cavalier...I'll be yours my dear. and I'll belong to you... if you'll just let me through. This is easy as lovers go, so don't complicate it by hesitating. and this is wonderful as loving goes, This is telling me 'whats the sense in waiting?'  And I said "I've gotta be honest I've been waiting for you all my life." For so long I thought I was asylum bound, but just seeing you makes me think twice. and being with you here makes me sane, I fear I'll go crazy if you leave my side.  You've got wits, You've got looks, You've got passion but are you brave enough to leave with me tonight?  tonight. tonight. but you've got me...  I'll be true, I'll be useful... I'll be cavalier, I'll be yours my dear. and I'll belong to you... If you'll just let me through. This is easy as lovers go, so don't complicate it by hesitating. And this is wonderful as loving goes, this is telling me 'whats the sense in waiting?' This is easy as lovers go, so don't complicate it by hesitating.

      Ok, this is kind of long, but I thought I'd share... This is little piece of Les Miz I thought was sweet... If you aren't emo, or think like an emo kid, you probably won't like this that much.   It starts with the letter the Marius leaves for Cosette under a stone.    Volume IV. Book Fifth.--The End of Which Does Not Resemble the Beginning. Chapter IV. A Heart beneath a Stone  The reduction of the universe to a single being, the expansion of a single being even to God, that is love.  Love is the salutation of the angels to the stars.  How sad is the soul, when it is sad through love!  What a void in the absence of the being who, by herself alone fills the world! Oh! how true it is that the beloved being becomes God. One could comprehend that God might be jealous of this had not God the Father of all evidently made creation for the soul, and the soul for love.  The glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac curtain is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams.  God is behind everything, but everything hides God. Things are black, creatures are opaque. To love a being is to render that being transparent.  Certain thoughts are prayers. There are moments when, whatever the attitude of the body may be, the soul is on its knees.  Parted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices, which possess, however, a reality of their own. They are prevented from seeing each other, they cannot write to each other; they discover a multitude of mysterious means to correspond. They send each other the song of the birds, the perfume of the flowers, the smiles of children, the light of the sun, the sighings of the breeze, the rays of stars, all creation. And why not? All the works of God are made to serve love. Love is sufficiently potent to charge all nature with its messages.  Oh Spring! Thou art a letter that I write to her.  The future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds. Love, that is the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity. In the infinite, the inexhaustible is requisite.  Love participates of the soul itself. It is of the same nature. Like it, it is the divine spark; like it, it is incorruptible, indivisible, imperishable. It is a point of fire that exists within us, which is immortal and infinite, which nothing can confine, and which nothing can extinguish. We feel it burning even to the very marrow of our bones, and we see it beaming in the very depths of heaven.  Oh Love! Adorations! voluptuousness of two minds which understand each other, of two hearts which exchange with each other, of two glances which penetrate each other! You will come to me, will you not, bliss! strolls by twos in the solitudes! Blessed and radiant days! I have sometimes dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves from the lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the destinies of men.  God can add nothing to the happiness of those who love, except to give them endless duration. After a life of love, an eternity of love is, in fact, an augmentation; but to increase in intensity even the ineffable felicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world, is impossible, even to God. God is the plenitude of heaven; love is the plenitude of man.  You look at a star for two reasons, because it is luminous, and because it is impenetrable. You have beside you a sweeter radiance and a greater mystery, woman.  All of us, whoever we may be, have our respirable beings. We lack air and we stifle. Then we die. To die for lack of love is horrible. Suffocation of the soul.  When love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic unity, the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are concerned; they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of the same destiny; they are no longer anything but the two wings of the same spirit. Love, soar.  On the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she walks, you are lost, you love. But one thing remains for you to do: to think of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you.  What love commences can be finished by God alone.  True love is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost or a handkerchief found, and eternity is required for its devotion and its hopes. It is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitely little.  If you are a stone, be adamant; if you are a plant, be the sensitive plant; if you are a man, be love.  Nothing suffices for love. We have happiness, we desire paradise; we possess paradise, we desire heaven.  Oh ye who love each other, all this is contained in love. Understand how to find it there. Love has contemplation as well as heaven, and more than heaven, it has voluptuousness.  "Does she still come to the Luxembourg?" "No, sir." "This is the church where she attends mass, is it not?" "She no longer comes here." "Does she still live in this house?" "She has moved away." "Where has she gone to dwell?"  "She did not say."  What a melancholy thing not to know the address of one's soul!  Love has its childishness, other passions have their pettinesses. Shame on the passions which belittle man! Honor to the one which makes a child of him!  There is one strange thing, do you know it? I dwell in the night. There is a being who carried off my sky when she went away.  Oh! would that we were lying side by side in the same grave, hand in hand, and from time to time, in the darkness, gently caressing a finger,--that would suffice for my eternity!  Ye who suffer because ye love, love yet more. To die of love, is to live in it.  Love. A sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture. There is ecstasy in agony.  Oh joy of the birds! It is because they have nests that they sing.  Love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise.  Deep hearts, sage minds, take life as God has made it; it is a long trial, an incomprehensible preparation for an unknown destiny. This destiny, the true one, begins for a man with the first step inside the tomb. Then something appears to him, and he begins to distinguish the definitive. The definitive, meditate upon that word. The living perceive the infinite; the definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead. In the meanwhile, love and suffer, hope and contemplate. Woe, alas! to him who shall have loved only bodies, forms, appearances! Death will deprive him of all. Try to love souls, you will find them again.  I encountered in the street, a very poor young man who was in love. His hat was old, his coat was worn, his elbows were in holes; water trickled through his shoes, and the stars through his soul.  What a grand thing it is to be loved! What a far grander thing it is to love! The heart becomes heroic, by dint of passion. It is no longer composed of anything but what is pure; it no longer rests on anything that is not elevated and great. An unworthy thought can no more germinate in it, than a nettle on a glacier. The serene and lofty soul, inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions, dominating the clouds and the shades of this world, its follies, its lies, its hatreds, its vanities, its miseries, inhabits the blue of heaven, and no longer feels anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny, as the crests of mountains feel the shocks of earthquake.  If there did not exist some one who loved, the sun would become extinct.    Volume IV. Book Fifth.--The End of Which Does Not Resemble the Beginning. Chapter V. Cosette after the Letter  As Cosette read, she gradually fell into thought. At the very moment when she raised her eyes from the last line of the note-book, the handsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate,-- it was his hour; Cosette thought him hideous.  She resumed her contemplation of the book. It was written in the most charming of chirography, thought Cosette; in the same hand, but with divers inks, sometimes very black, again whitish, as when ink has been added to the inkstand, and consequently on different days. It was, then, a mind which had unfolded itself there, sigh by sigh, irregularly, without order, without choice, without object, hap-hazard. Cosette had never read anything like it. This manuscript, in which she already perceived more light than obscurity, produced upon her the effect of a half-open sanctuary. Each one of these mysterious lines shone before her eyes and inundated her heart with a strange radiance. The education which she had received had always talked to her of the soul, and never of love, very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the flame. This manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealed to her all of love, sorrow, destiny, life, eternity, the beginning, the end. It was as if a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon her a handful of rays of light. In these few lines she felt a passionate, ardent, generous, honest nature, a sacred will, an immense sorrow, and an immense despair, a suffering heart, an ecstasy fully expanded. What was this manuscript? A letter. A letter without name, without address, without date, without signature, pressing and disinterested, an enigma composed of truths, a message of love made to be brought by an angel and read by a virgin, an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth, the love-letter of a phantom to a shade. It was an absent one, tranquil and dejected, who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who sent to the absent love, his lady, the secret of fate, the key of life, love. This had been written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven. These lines, which had fallen one by one on the paper, were what might be called drops of soul.  Now, from whom could these pages come? Who could have penned them?  Cosette did not hesitate a moment. One man only.  He!  Day had dawned once more in her spirit; all had reappeared. She felt an unheard-of joy, and a profound anguish. It was he! he who had written! he was there! it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing! While she was forgetful of him, he had found her again! But had she forgotten him? No, never! She was foolish to have thought so for a single moment. She had always loved him, always adored him. The fire had been smothered, and had smouldered for a time, but she saw all plainly now; it had but made headway, and now it had burst forth afresh, and had inflamed her whole being. This note-book was like a spark which had fallen from that other soul into hers. She felt the conflagration starting up once more.  She imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript: "Oh yes!" said she, "how perfectly I recognize all that! That is what I had already read in his eyes." As she was finishing it for the third time, Lieutenant Theodule passed the gate once more, and rattled his spurs upon the pavement. Cosette was forced to raise her eyes. She thought him insipid, silly, stupid, useless, foppish, displeasing, impertinent, and extremely ugly. The officer thought it his duty to smile at her.  She turned away as in shame and indignation. She would gladly have thrown something at his head.  She fled, re-entered the house, and shut herself up in her chamber to peruse the manuscript once more, to learn it by heart, and to dream. When she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in her bosom.  All was over, Cosette had fallen back into deep, seraphic love. The abyss of Eden had yawned once more.  All day long, Cosette remained in a sort of bewilderment. She scarcely thought, her ideas were in the state of a tangled skein in her brain, she could not manage to conjecture anything, she hoped through a tremor, what? vague things. She dared make herself no promises, and she did not wish to refuse herself anything. Flashes of pallor passed over her countenance, and shivers ran through her frame. It seemed to her, at intervals, that she was entering the land of chimaeras; she said to herself: "Is this reality?" Then she felt of the dear paper within her bosom under her gown, she pressed it to her heart, she felt its angles against her flesh; and if Jean Valjean had seen her at the moment, he would have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy, which overflowed from beneath her eyelids.--"Oh yes!" she thought, "it is certainly he! This comes from him, and is for me!"  And she told herself that an intervention of the angels, a celestial chance, had given him back to her.  Oh transfiguration of love! Oh dreams! That celestial chance, that intervention of the angels, was a pellet of bread tossed by one thief to another thief, from the Charlemagne Courtyard to the Lion's Ditch, over the roofs of La Force.   Volume IV. Book Fifth.--The End of Which Does Not Resemble the Beginning. Chapter VI. Old People are made to go out opportunely  When evening came, Jean Valjean went out; Cosette dressed herself. She arranged her hair in the most becoming manner, and she put on a dress whose bodice had received one snip of the scissors too much, and which, through this slope, permitted a view of the beginning of her throat, and was, as young girls say, "a trifle indecent." It was not in the least indecent, but it was prettier than usual. She made her toilet thus without knowing why she did so.  Did she mean to go out? No.  Was she expecting a visitor? No.  At dusk, she went down to the garden. Toussaint was busy in her kitchen, which opened on the back yard.  She began to stroll about under the trees, thrusting aside the branches from time to time with her hand, because there were some which hung very low.  In this manner she reached the bench.  The stone was still there.  She sat down, and gently laid her white hand on this stone as though she wished to caress and thank it.  All at once, she experienced that indefinable impression which one undergoes when there is some one standing behind one, even when she does not see the person.  She turned her head and rose to her feet.  It was he.  His head was bare. He appeared to have grown thin and pale. His black clothes were hardly discernible. The twilight threw a wan light on his fine brow, and covered his eyes in shadows. Beneath a veil of incomparable sweetness, he had something about him that suggested death and night. His face was illuminated by the light of the dying day, and by the thought of a soul that is taking flight.  He seemed to be not yet a ghost, and he was no longer a man.  He had flung away his hat in the thicket, a few paces distant.  Cosette, though ready to swoon, uttered no cry. She retreated slowly, for she felt herself attracted. He did not stir. By virtue of something ineffable and melancholy which enveloped him, she felt the look in his eyes which she could not see.  Cosette, in her retreat, encountered a tree and leaned against it. Had it not been for this tree, she would have fallen.  Then she heard his voice, that voice which she had really never heard, barely rising above the rustle of the leaves, and murmuring:--  "Pardon me, here I am. My heart is full. I could not live on as I was living, and I have come. Have you read what I placed there on the bench? Do you recognize me at all? Have no fear of me. It is a long time, you remember the day, since you looked at me at the Luxembourg, near the Gladiator. And the day when you passed before me? It was on the 16th of June and the 2d of July. It is nearly a year ago. I have not seen you for a long time. I inquired of the woman who let the chairs, and she told me that she no longer saw you. You lived in the Rue de l'Ouest, on the third floor, in the front apartments of a new house,--you see that I know! I followed you. What else was there for me to do? And then you disappeared. I thought I saw you pass once, while I was reading the newspapers under the arcade of the Odeon. I ran after you. But no. It was a person who had a bonnet like yours. At night I came hither. Do not be afraid, no one sees me. I come to gaze upon your windows near at hand. I walk very softly, so that you may not hear, for you might be alarmed. The other evening I was behind you, you turned round, I fled. Once, I heard you singing. I was happy. Did it affect you because I heard you singing through the shutters? That could not hurt you. No, it is not so? You see, you are my angel! Let me come sometimes; I think that I am going to die. If you only knew! I adore you. Forgive me, I speak to you, but I do not know what I am saying; I may have displeased you; have I displeased you?"  "Oh! my mother!" said she.  And she sank down as though on the point of death.  He grasped her, she fell, he took her in his arms, he pressed her close, without knowing what he was doing. He supported her, though he was tottering himself. It was as though his brain were full of smoke; lightnings darted between his lips; his ideas vanished; it seemed to him that he was accomplishing some religious act, and that he was committing a profanation. Moreover, he had not the least passion for this lovely woman whose force he felt against his breast. He was beside himself with love.  She took his hand and laid it on her heart. He felt the paper there, he stammered:--  "You love me, then?"  She replied in a voice so low that it was no longer anything more than a barely audible breath:--  "Hush! You know it!"  And she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb and intoxicated young man.  He fell upon the bench, and she beside him. They had no words more. The stars were beginning to gleam. How did it come to pass that their lips met? How comes it to pass that the birds sing, that snow melts, that the rose unfolds, that May expands, that the dawn grows white behind the black trees on the shivering crest of the hills?  A kiss, and that was all.  Both started, and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes.  They felt neither the cool night, nor the cold stone, nor the damp earth, nor the wet grass; they looked at each other, and their hearts were full of thoughts. They had clasped hands unconsciously.  She did not ask him, she did not even wonder, how he had entered there, and how he had made his way into the garden. It seemed so simple to her that he should be there!  From time to time, Marius' knee touched Cosette's knee, and both shivered.  At intervals, Cosette stammered a word. Her soul fluttered on her lips like a drop of dew on a flower.  Little by little they began to talk to each other. Effusion followed silence, which is fulness. The night was serene and splendid overhead. These two beings, pure as spirits, told each other everything, their dreams, their intoxications, their ecstasies, their chimaeras, their weaknesses, how they had adored each other from afar, how they had longed for each other, their despair when they had ceased to see each other. They confided to each other in an ideal intimacy, which nothing could augment, their most secret and most mysterious thoughts. They related to each other, with candid faith in their illusions, all that love, youth, and the remains of childhood which still lingered about them, suggested to their minds. Their two hearts poured themselves out into each other in such wise, that at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it was the young man who had the young girl's soul, and the young girl who had the young man's soul. Each became permeated with the other, they were enchanted with each other, they dazzled each other.  When they had finished, when they had told each other everything, she laid her head on his shoulder and asked him:--  "What is your name?"  "My name is Marius," said he. "And yours?"  "My name is Cosette."

      "A Better Place, A Better Time" by Streetlight Manifesto  and so she wakes up in time to break down she left a note up on the dresser and she's right on time you don't know anything right or wrong i say i know and she says so i want to panic but i've had it so i go  (you don't owe anything to anyone)  but don't take your life becuase it's all you've got you'd be better off just up and leaving if you don't think they will stop  and when you wake up, everything is going to be fine i guarantee that you wake in a better place in a better time so you're tired of living and you feel that you might give in well don't it's not your time   flipping through the paper today looking for a specific page don't want to find her full name followed by dates because when i left her alone she made a sound, like a moan "you're known by everyone for everything you've done" fuck buying flowers for graves i'd rather buy you a one way non-stop to anywhere, find anyone do anything, forget and start again, love she said she won't go and that's that it hurts too much to stand by you've got to stop and draw a line and everyone here has to choose a side tonight the moment of truth is haunting you don't forget your family regardless of what you choose to do. you cant decide and they're all screaming "why won't you?" i'll start the engine but i can't take this ride for you i'll draw the bath and i'll load your gun but i hope so hard that you bathe and hunt.  annie's tired of forgetting about today and always planning for tomorrow annie says "the saddest day i came across was when i learned that life goes on without me" annie says "if everyone has someone else, then i ain't got nobody's love to save me" annie says "i think i'll pass away tonight, because it seems i'll never get it right if it's just me"   and when you wake up everything's going to be fine  i guarantee that you'll wake in a better place in a better time.  so you're tired of living and you feel like you might give in, well don't. it's not your time.  annie says she wouldn't mind if they never find a cure for all her problems. annie says as long as she has someone near to make it clear she does not need to solve them "oh this loneliness is killing me it's filling me with anger and resentment i'm turning into someone that i never thought i'd have to be again"   and even if it was i wouldn't let you go you could run run run run but i will follow close someday you will say "that's it, that's all" but i'll be waiting there with open arms to break your fall i know that you think that you are on your own but just know that i am here and i'll lead you home if you let me she said forget me, but i can't.

      I don't want to get my hopes up TOO much, but my parents are thinking of buying me a 4 or more octive, rosewood (or another wood, no synthetic keys) marimba!  If that happened, you have no idea how happy I would be.

      So, I really haven't posted much in a while... What's been happening with me?   Well, thursday night the power went out, around 8. Next morning, power's still out. So I go over to Caitlin’s house for like, the entire day, we watched Fight Club and some of Life As A House. Dan and Vicki were there too. I got back home at like, 10:45ish.  So, today it was pretty boring, we did a stand still (which sucked) and came home. It felt like a giant waste of time. I was also in a pissy mood or something, I was just tired and I hate being hot.   After I came home, I went on the computer and I rented Dark City and The Crow.  Dark City: An amazing movie, nearly identical to The Matrix though... Dark City came out a year before The Matrix... so I REALLY doubt anyone was copying off the other person. Dark City is also like City Of The Lost Children, because they both have societies of pale bald men, and there's someone who doesn't have a soul, and they're trying to understand normal humans. Dark City was a great movie though.  The Crow: Now, I did like this movie. I liked Dark City more... I like movies that aren't so out there and everything just makes perfect sense. It seemed a little too Hollywood. The dialogue was annoying, and at times really corny. The acting was fair, the little girl Sarah wasn't that great. Now you might say, "she's just a kid, what do you expect?" Go see City Of The Lost Children. Those french kid actors are better then lots of AMERICAN ADULT actors. I read in a review that "it's really dark, and that might turn some people off". Now, that's kind of like saying The Ataris are hardcore punk. I mean, The Ataris are PUNK, and I do enjoy them, but they're not hardcore punk. The Crow WAS dark, it was violent too. But I've seen many a darker movie. Like Dark City, and City Of The Lost Children. I'm not a big fan of rock soundtracks in a movie though. I mean, not like Guster in Life As A House, but Nine Inch Nails in this. The Cure song and then the Nine Inch Nails song right after it sounded WAYYY too similar. That bothered me. All in all, it was a good movie, but I really don't see why people are obsessed with it other than they must be giant posers. Yeah, the guy wears make up and plays guitar. The dialogue sucks. The acting isn't that great. Go find a better movie.  This has been "At The Movies with Brian Maher"  Ok, now it's night time, there's that college band competition thing tomorrow. It should be fun.  I'm done now.

      I felt like updating, but not much is happening... at all...  It's too hot and humid to think, Autumn can come ANNNNYYY time now. Stupid heat... ugh.  So... god I'm bored, and tired of the heat. I need something interesting in my life. You, make my life interesting. Whoever you are, make it interesting now.

      Ok, here's a new post... I, again, don't really know what to say, or why I'm posting at all. It'd be easy to think of stuff if all that stuff I've been thinking about is pretty personal. I don't want to go sending my most personal thoughts out on the internet! And chances are that I don't want you to know them anyway.   Let's see... I went to a concert friday night, and it freaking rocked so hard. It was The Format, who were pretty good. The Polysics... oh my god the Polysics. They are the best band, ever. They were SOOOOO amazing. The Exit was after them, and I left the area for that, they kinda sucked. And then, Rx Bandits. They were AMAZING! They didn't stop playing until they finished. They transitioned all the songs into another song. They were so good and I had a great time. I bought a shirt, I think I'll wear it tomorrow.   Ok, what else? I think I'll end with some lyrics   "Again I Go Unnoticed"  So quiet another wasted night, the television steals the conversation exhale, another wasted breath, again it goes unnoticed.  Please tell me you're just feeling tired cause if it's more than that I feeel that I might break out of touch, out of time.  Please send me anything but signals that are mixed casue I can't read your rolling eyes out of touch, are we out of time?   Close lipped another goodnight kiss is robbed of all it's passion, your grip another time, is slack it leaves me feeling empty.  I'll wait until tomorrow maybe you'll feel better then maybe we'll be better then so what's another day when I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you this mood of yours is temporary it seems worth the wait to see your smile again out of the corner of your eye won't be the only way you'll look at me then.

      Alright kiddies, here's an update:   Well, my dad ordered me a 4.3 octive Ross marimba, and I am VERY excited. They first said it would come in a month, therefore coming in November (he ordered it sometime in October) which is one of the reasons we bought that specific model, that and it's the one I liked the best. We found out later that it's not even going to get shipped from Ross to Music123 until December! Then Music123 still has to ship it to us, which will take a while. So, I'm guessing it'll come in Janruary, and if I'm really unlucky, February.   I've been in a really good mood lately, not really sure why but I'm feeling great.   For all you Brian Maher fans (and I know there are like, 5,000 of you out there) come to St. Matt's church in Springfield on November 8th at 7:00. There is going to be one awesome show! The Rising Action, Best Kept Secret, The Emphasis, Marden, and... BIOCOOGANA! But wait! You heard that music god Kris Nolte can't play at the show? He has some very important keyboard parts! How will Biocoogana ever be able to play? What's this you say? Our very own, Brian Maher, can play keyboard? And he already knows one part of one song (and the chords to another song)? Then, I guess BRIAN MAHER WILL BE PLAYING WITH BIOCOOGANA!  Yes, I will be playing keyboard for Biocoogana, November 8th. Kris is suposed to get my the keyboard parts today, and I'm going to work as hard as I can to learn them perfectly.  Ok, I'm done, bye.

      Liebe auf den ersten Blick Uns trennen hundert lange Yahre Ein unsichtbarer Draht und - Klick Am anfang einer neuen Phase Atemlos lieg' ich im Schlummer Eisgekühlt im tiefen Trauma Eingespeichert - meilenweit Kein regenbogen weit und breit   *Küss mich wach Aud meinem eisiegen Schlaf Küss mich waxh Aus dem Dornröschenschlaf Küss mich wach - Küss mich wach - Küss mich wach   Im kalten Schlaf' wart' ich auf dich Ich hab' die Zeit schon längst besiegt Komm her zu mir und wecke mich Da draussen tobt der SonnenKrieg.      Lass mich dein Pirat sein Auf allen sieben Meeren Wir segeln bis zum Horizont Begleiten wird uns nur der Mond Lass mich dein Pilot sein In wolkenlosen Lüften Voll Sehnsucht ruf' ich deinen Namen Wir werfen unser Geld zusammen  Für dich mach' ich verrückte Sachen Ich lege dir die Welt zu Füssen Und hol' für dich den Stern vom Himmel Um dich ein einziges Mal zu küssen   Lass mich dein Pirat sein Durch strassen ohne Ende Wir gehen bis zum Horizont Begleiten wird uns nur der Mond.     Deutsch ist sehr gut.

      Ha, I'm such an idiot... I looked at the bottom of the page on music123 about my marimba, and it says, "Comes with cover and mallets" and here I was thinking I was special or something...

      Another great update!  So, I walk into my house on Tuesday and I see about 3 huge boxes with the word, "Ross" printed on them. Hey, what does Ross make? Well, it wasn't 3 boxes with midgets named Ross in them, I'll tell you that much. IT WAS MY MARIMBA! My dad called and complained about how late it would come when they said it would come earlier. So, not only did I get a marimba, but it came with two pairs of mallets from Innovative Percussion (for all you mallet percussionists, one pair was the Fundamental Series F1's and the others were the Fundamental Series F2's) and a cover, for free!   4.3 octaves, rosewood keys... beautiful full arch resonators. It's a beautiful thing. The sound is PERFECT. It has to be one of the most beautiful things I've heard in my life. Now I know why people like rosewood keys over everthing else.   So, it's tomorrow... Biocoogana featuring Brian Maher on keyboard! You'd all better be there. It's tomorrow at 7PM. at St. Matts in Springfield. The line up is The Rising Action (Dayna's band... yeah Dayna) Biocoogana, Best Kept Secrect, The Emphasis and The Unsinkable Mr. Marden.   You'd better be there!

      "A Drag In D Flat"  If every limb were broken, tires had all worn thin and my toes are all in pieces. Do you know what I would do? I would play can you drag yourself  200 miles  with just your fingernails? A little game that I made up. Do you know that I never ever lose? There is nothing to  keep me from coming back to you cause I can picture all the pictures of you and me on your walls. What would it take to make you mine forever? Just your fingernails, a little game that I made up. Do you know, that I never ever lose? Could I cut out my liver,  make a special potion to close my flat? Three parts my heart. Yeah, you know that I would do it in a second. With just my fingernails, a little game that I made up. Do you know that I never ever lose? With just my fingernails, a little game that I made up. Do you know that I never ever lose? Never lose.  [in the background:] (I am not afraid of what it takes to glue you to my side, Even if it takes a little bleeding, So be it.  And I could go without breathing, And I won't justify it. You just watch me, I've got time to kill)

      I've been listening to Saves The Day for some reason... So I think I'll post the lyrics to the song I'm listening to now.   "Rocks Tonic Juice Magic"  Let me take this awkward saw And run it against your thighs Cut some flesh away I'll carry this piece of you with me Because all I can say tonight is that I hate you But it would be all right If we could see each other sometime If I could somehow make you mine And if not I'll take my spoons And dig out your blue eyes I'll swallow them down to my colon They're gonna burn like hell tonight Cause you're beautiful Just not on the inside Light comes from within Your beaming eyes don't seem so bright Heart is on the floor Why don't you step on it? When I think of all the things you've done Boardwalks and breaking waves Made our Saturdays I'd buy you lemonade right now if you were here Then I'd throw it in your face And I'd listen to you cry I'd remember how I miss our nights under ocean skies You and I are like when fire and the ocean floor collide.

I want to be with you every night, to feel your body pressed against me tight, don't fight your mighty sexuality cause I want to see your lips form the words and say, (Chorus).......    Ahh...

      Here's an update:  For the past few weeks in church, I've been going to this class taught by Tom McDaniel about tranlations of the Bible. It's incredibly interesting. The Bible was originally written in a short hand version of Hebrew that doesn't use vowels or spaces. So a sentence might look like this. ssntncmghtlklkths. That's pretty hard to read, that could say anything! Years later, people wrote in the vowels, the spaces, and the little accents. The accents create a LOT of ambiguity. A small dot could change the meaning of a word from "hate" to "love". Like the one quote from Jesus, Matthew 10:34 "I have come not to bring peace, but a sword". That doesn't make any sense, does it? I mean, think of Matthew 5:9! ANOTHER quote from Jesus saying, "Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the sons of God". Tom McDaniel took away all the vowels and accents and tried to figure it out. He came up with something that makes so much more sense! "I have come not to bring the end, but I have come to (either Make A Change, or Establish A Covenant Community)." Doesn't that fit with the sprit of the "Prince Of Peace" so much better?  Tom McDaniel suggested that there isn't a problem with God. There is a problem with the Bible. What's kind of scary is that people were so more quick to find fault with God than with our modern translation of the Bible! Someone in the class said that we've created a stone Idol of the Bible. People respect the Bible as an object more than the words in it. Everything just makes sense now.  Tom McDaniel told us you really find more out about the opinion of the translator than what was actually written. With so much ambiguity, it's easy to sneak your own ideas in there. If you think Jesus really meant to bring a sword, not peace... you translate it that way.  Another thing that came up is the lexicons people used to translate the Bible. I'll put it to you this way. Think of the English language. A Fag in Englad is a cigarette, but here it's a hurtful word for a gay person. And a long time ago, different words may have meant different things. The modern lexicons have dropped some of the words that may have been used back in Jesus's time. When Jesus was speaking, chances are that he didn't use the same kind of Hebrew that's around today. Tom McDaniel found some older lexicons, and that helped him figure out some different words to make it all make sense.  His website is http://www.ebts.edu/tmcdaniel/mcd.html , I also have a cd with all the files on his site that he gave to us today if you're really interested. I really liked Chapters 30 and 31.     On a completely different note, I saw Springfield's play, "California Suite", and it was incredibly funny! Sue was a hooker who was passed out drunk for the whole thing. Caitlin and I decided we're moving to Springfield.. their acting program is so nice. They have this little theater thing they had the play in. It was so good, and it was only 3 dollars. Next they're going to do the Laramie Project, and I'm DEFINATELY going to see it.

      My sister just told me about this... For all you people who like Lord Of The Rings and like musicals, you'll be the only one's who will understand this.  http://www.geocities.com/epicmusicalparody/index.html  I really think that if Boromir died while singing A Little Fall Of Rain, it would really add to the emotion, but that's just me.  Also, Sam and Frodo singing The Impossible Dream at the end of The Two Towers... I know it would make ME cry.  I do think they should've capitalized a little more on the whole Smeagol/Gollum thing, you know how in Jekal and Hyde they have the same problem. Seriously, they both have their, "fighting with themselves" scenes.

      Oh! I have something interesting to talk about!    Ok, so I go into the bathroom and I'm about to take a shower, so I take off my pants, and realize there's someone on the roof, cleaning out the skylight. Good thing I noticed before I got anymore naked.... don't I feel dumb... I do wish someone had told me about this though...   Man do I EVER feel stupid...

      Ok, the only things going on in my life are PERSONAL things... if I want you to know I'll tell you.    But I can tell you about my day. The people in my school are so rude, they always bump into people and they don't care AT ALL. They suck.  We had a pep rally today, and our class won the Lions cheer. The seniors MIGHT have won (not, we're so good) but come time for the Lions cheer, they spelled out something else, "B-O-N-E-R! BONER!" and were then disqualified for fowl language.  That's it... I mean, there's a WHOLE bunch of other stuff, but I'm sure as hell not going to tell you all about it.

The parents will take it away after that and I'll have to use the family computer.     you are either a record nerd or not a scenester at all. you are the coolest of the bunch. bravo, dude.   This new computer is freaking awesome by the way. It has a burner that is 24 times the speed of my old one, and games actually RUN on it! It's quite the amazing.

      So, maybe you're wondering, "what's happening in the life of Brian?". You probably aren't though. Chances are you couldn't give any less of a fuck what's happening in my life, and you're reading this because: A. I told you to. B. You're incredibly bored C. Both A and B  But since you're here, I'll tell you anyway.   New years was great, I filmed myself being a jackass. No really, it was fun. We watched Boondock Saints and spent the rest of the night saying, "Little fuck" and "Insignificant cunt".   What have I been doing with my life? You might ask. Well, I got a new computer, and I have the internet in my room for a little bit now, so I've been downloading episodes of Family Guy and Futerama. I've also been playing games (Soul Reaver 2 and No One Lives Forever) because now my computer is good enough to play games.   I got some good cds for christmas, and I've been listening to them. Specificly: The Amelie soundtrack Benton Falls: Fighting Starlight The Get Up Kids: Four Minute Mile Dashboard Confessional: The Swiss Army Romance Appleseed Cast: Low Level Owl (volumes 1 and 2) The Weakerthans: Left and Leaving Ska Box Anthology Taking Back Sunday: Tell All Your Friends  I've really been enjoying Benton Falls lately, that's some good stuff.   That's it. I'm probably going to sit on my ass for the rest of break being a huge loser.

      Laetitia, you destroy me, so I can see why I feel so lonely when you and me could be forever perfectly perfect together. I know. Broken down in my dead bedroom, stuttering to pictures of you. I know that you can always see me. I saw you staring through my TV last night. So I'll leave the door open all night, in case you decide you want to stop on by. Because you got to know who's been singing that song on the radio. The one that goes... My friends all call me crazy cause I stay up late anticipating, and planning for the day I sweep you off your feet, I'd never leave you alone. Laetitia, you got my hand shaking, I'm begging you oh baby please stop breaking my heart because I got the feeling that you and I will never really get it on. So I'll leave the door open all night in case you decide you want to stop on by. Because you got to know who's been singing that song on the radio. The one that goes... Girl, come to me. The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need, or I'll be left alone forever with my magazines.

      On Brown Shoes and Black Pants (TJ Monkeys, by Porter)  I just thought you should know, you shouldn't wear brown shoes with black pants. brown shoes used to go out with black pants, and then they broke up, and now it's all awkward. Plus, black pants moved on a lot quicker than brown shoes, and started going out with black shoes, like, the next week.   Brown shoes didn't really get over it for a while. I mean, they sort of had a thing going with khaki pants, but...khaki pants sort of have a thing going with everyone right now, if you know what I mean.   Poor brown shoes. The problem is, there's no one brown shoes are really perfect for. I mean, yes, brown shoes have always felt some chemistry with green pants, but to be honest, green pants are really just hung up on black shoes, too.   Black shoes...they just...have it, you know? All the pants can see themselves with black shoes. It's not black shoes' fault. They're just being who they are, and that's awesome. Hell, brown shoes think black shoes are great. They've been friends for years.   (sigh) Brown shoes just really thought they had something going with black pants. I know, I know, it seems silly. They seemed mismatched right from the start. And they were introduced to each other by white tube socks, so they were already starting off in weird territory.   But it worked, you know? For that night, it...just seemed to work. They were at a bar; it was dark; everything just seemed OK.   But the next morning...everything was different. Brown shoes were all talkative and excited, hopeful that a something new was budding. Black pants just folded up. Brown shoes tried to ignore it at first, passing it off as that awkwardness comes with any first time fashion combination.   But pretty soon it was clear that the interest had waned. Or was never there to begin with.   "Wanna go see a movie with me on Friday?" asked brown shoes, with sheepish optimism. "No, I'm being ironed Friday, I think, or maybe I'm at the cleaners," replied black pants.   It wasn't so much what they said as how they said it, the way black pants avoided looking brown shoes directly in the laces.   And so, over time, without any real clarification, brown shoes got the message. "I wish they would've just said something out right," whimpered brown shoes. And now, when they see black pants with black shoes, they sigh and order another beer. They know it's right. It's a better match. There's no way brown shoes and black pants would've really lasted.   And yet...   (sigh)   Well, brown shoes is doing better now. They're seeing a pair of shorts these days. It's fun. A summer fling. They never really get too close, but maybe that's best. Brown shoes don't need any more heartache. Maybe one day, a pair of pants will come along that really understands brown shoes. Maybe. But brown shoes are getting scuffed. They've needed new soles for a while. It might be pretty much over for brown shoes.   Ah, well. At least, for that one night, brown shoes felt that magical connection that comes along with a perfect clothing match.   Anyway, yeah, brown shoes don't go with black pants. So change one or the other. Yes, it's easier to change the shoes, I know. But maybe, this one time, change the pants, and leave on the brown shoes.   It would mean a lot to me.   I mean, to brown shoes.   (sigh) I mean me.

      hey mike i wish i could help you figure something out but it's been too long since we spoke your sarcasm radiates unhappiness so withdrawn and rooted deep inside are you content at twenty-seven were you hopeful at 17? a void the size of oceans stretches out between us i guess our blood is suppose to be a bridge can you pull yourself up from this self hatred can you pull yourself up frustrations driven you to angry dreams let nebraska disappear in golden flames of grain i know you can't imagine having company right now there's a world of tired faces that understand this pain there's a better life waiting on the outside of these decaying walls your bitterness doesn't surprise me as these pointless days go screaming by rejected sour eyes can't imagine blue skies i wish you could find something to live for besides the agony of bleeding towards the last breath i truly believe that you want more than this (this is killing you) that what you want is very simple somehow so complex to get please don't hate yourself.    Wow, it's been months since I listened to this song, or the Lawrence Arms at all... what a good song.

      in the face of change is when she turned to me and said, "i'm not sure anymore..."  and there amidst the waves and the cloudless skies that blanket the year before i watch my life wash ashore  have you ever been a part of something that you thought would never end? and then of course it did  have you ever felt the weight inside you pulling away inside your skin? and then something had to give  now the lines are drawn is this feeling gone? the best parts of this have come and gone and now that is all this is  with the reasons clear we'll spend another year without direction, full of fear but now things will be different  there's nothing simple when it comes to you and i always something in this everchanging life and it probably always will now that time is getting harder to come by the same arguments are always on our mind we've killed this slowly fading light  now something has kept me here too long and you can't leave me if i'm already gone  make the same mistakes we're always hanging on break the promises we're always leaning on all this time spent waking up now i keep this line open to get this call from you as you speak the words that keep me coming back to you now this time it's all different  now something has kept me here too long and now i'm gone...     Too bad I'm not going to see them, but I'll get over it.

      don't break too many hearts. don't take too many arrows in the chest. cry comfortably, let us all know what you're thinking. is there a gesture i could use to clearly express i'm at an utter loss for words? is there a part of you that's torn? that's larger than life? that'll hold on for one more night? i've got a speech to make. followed by a big parade. northside. closed eyes. all charades go on forever. hands tied with fools pride. in a slowly fleeing summer. just throw your hands up at the sky. no use trying to explain this. the clouds are mirrors. i'm disguised. i'm not all that entertaining. the city looks the same until you notice smaller changes. it still knows us all by name. it holds us close to its heart (now repeat) all my hopes are unaligned. this diagnosis is self-designed. northside. closed eyes. all charades go on forever. ands tied with fools pride. in a slowly fleeing summer. empty rooms don't have pictures to talk to. brickwall views demand uninspired afternoons. the days are flooding into months. the nights are staring into centuries. i've got some older pictures of people i see once every couple years. intrigued or unamazed. "you were so much different back in those days." and now this smile has a bitter curve. now these eyes are unenchanted. and all we see is a faded image of what we used to be. how can we relate when we don't know a thing about each other anymore? is there a gesture i could use to clearly express i'm at an utter loss for words.

      Group seeks monument condemning gay victim Associated Press  LEBANON, Pa. - An antigay group wants to install a monument condemning a gay teenager who killed himself after he was taunted by his peers and whose story became the subject of a documentary.  Fred Phelps, who leads the Topeka, Kan.-based Westboro Baptist Church, has asked the city for permission to install a 6-foot pink granite edifice bearing the name of Jim Wheeler, a 1997 graduate of Cedar Crest High School and the subject of the film Jim in Bold.  The proposed monument would read, in part: "In Loving Memory of Jim Wheeler, Entered Hell November 17, 1997, at age 19, A Suicide Who Defied God's Warning."  In a letter to Lebanon Mayor Robert Anspach and the City Council, Phelps suggested Monument Park, site of a Civil War memorial, or Fisher Park, which has a Vietnam veterans memorial, as suitable sites.  Local officials said they would reject the proposal.  "Mr. Wheeler was a fine resident of Lebanon County and an outstanding citizen. Let me assure you they will have to sue to get it" built, Lebanon County Commissioner Bill Carpenter said.  Shirley Phelps-Roper, Phelps' daughter and a Westboro spokeswoman, has said that the group is ready to sue if its monument is denied.  The group has tried to erect similar monuments in Casper, Wyo.; Boise, Idaho; and Topeka, Kan., to Matthew Shepard, a University of Wyoming student who was murdered in 1998 because he was gay.  In those places, there were parks containing monuments to the Ten Commandments - and Phelps argued that one religious group cannot be denied permission to put up a monument when another was permitted. Those cases are still being fought.  In Lebanon the monuments aren't religious, and that will bolster city officials' arguments in denying the request, city solicitor Scot Feeman said.  "These parks are dedicated solely for war monuments," he said. "What they want to erect is so different, it will probably be denied. It is so easily distinguishable by the courts."  The documentary Jim in Bold has appeared at more than two dozen film festivals on three continents, and its makers hope to turn it into a teaching tool for schools.   That monument has to be one of the most insensitive things I've ever heard of in my life. Who do they think they are, trying to make something like that. Why are they wasting their energy on making something so incredibly hateful? Think about it, let's see what they could use all that time and energy on. Making homes for the homeless maybe? Hateful religion should be an oxymoron. What would Jesus do? Christians should think that more often. The Jesus I'VE read about wouldn't work to condem anyone.  Fred Phelps gives life a bad name.

      So, I was at drum corps this weekend. We got music for the opener and it's some pretty good stuff. I have a good feeling about the pit this year, Tollie has really improved my technique. My air matress sucks, it was totally deflated both nights... I definately need a new one.  I'm gonna practice so much this month, I swear, tomorrow once everyone's awake, I'm getting out the mallets and I'm going to make sure I know every note in the opener perfectly.   I'm pretty tired... yep.  I still have a mark from when Alex slammed my finger in a drawer, thanks Alex, thanks a lot.   No, I'm kidding, I'm fine. It's just a little bruised or something.   So, all in all, my life is pretty good. I'm too happy to be emo.

      Dear Dr. Laura,  Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's law. I have learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend homosexuality, for example, I will simply remind him or her that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.  I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other laws in Leviticus and Exodus and how to best follow them.   When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Leviticus 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this?  I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as stated in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?  I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Leviticus 15:19-24). The problem is, how can I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.  Leviticus 25:44 states that I may buy slaves from the nations that are around us. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify?  I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?  A friend of mine says that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Leviticus 10:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?  Leviticus 20:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?  I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's Word is eternal and unchanging   I'm feeling quite the liberal at the moment.

      Last sunday a nun preached at our church about some artwork she did for the stations of the cross. Since I'm not catholic, I really don't know much about all that, but she mentioned a quote from the book All Quiet On The Western Front, which I thought was totally amazing.  To put it in context, the main character is a german who's around 18 (I haven't read the book, so this is just a rough outline from what I know) and he gets convinced to join the german army in 1914. Right before the quote I'm about to post, he kills someone up close for the first time, and he looks in his pockets and finds his wallet, which has identification and pictures of his family.  "'But now, for the first time, I see you are a man like me. I thought of your hand-grenades, of your bayonet, of your rifle; now I see your wife and your face and our fellowship. Forgive me, comrade. We always see it too late. Why do they never tell us that you are poor devils like us, that your mothers are just as anxious as ours, and that we have the same fear of death, and the same dying and the same agony--Forgive me, comrade; how could you be my enemy?'" Chapter 9, p. 223   After that, durring "concerns and celebrations"(It's where people come up and ask for prayers, talk about something good, etc.) the music director (who's jewish) came up and said that the quote reminded him of a story he heard on CBS back in WWI or WWII. On Christmas, the Germans and the Americans declared a cease fire, and durring that time, they all got together, and they taught each other christmas carols in their different languages. The Americans taught the Germans how to play football, and other things like that. So, after that, they had to go back to fighting again. And according to the music director, they refused to fight after that. They realized that they weren't fighting some nameless faceless "evil" they were fighting real people. After that, their commanders supposedly pulled all the soldiers out and replaced them with new brainwashed people who didn't know about each other. After that, he said, "when will we ever learn". Why can't we ever learn from history?

      Alright, updating the blog. This is the time in the show where if you're not as liberal as me, you just forget I wrote anything.  From  urlLink here   Top twelve reasons homosexual marriage should not be legal:  Top 12 Reasons Homosexual Marriage Should Not Be Legal  1. Homosexuality is not natural, much like eyeglasses, polyester, and birth control.   2.Heterosexual marriages are valid because they produce children. Infertile couples and old people can't legally get married because the world needs more children.   3.Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.   4.Straight marriage will be less meaningful, since Britney Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful.   5.Heterosexual marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are property, blacks can't marry whites, and divorce is illegal.   6.Gay marriage should be decided by people not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of the minorities.   7.Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.   8.Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.   9.Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.   10.Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why single parents are forbidden to raise children.   11.Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven't adapted to cars or longer life spans.   12.Civil unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a "separate but equal" institution is always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as well as separate marriages for gays and lesbians will.     http://www.godhatesshrimp.com/  Think about it.

      This is really important, and I think everyone should read this:  THE INVISIBLE KILLER  Dihydrogen monoxide is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, and kills uncounted thousands of people every year. Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DMHO, but the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure to its solid form causes severe sweating and tissue damage. Symptoms of DMHO ingestion can include excessive sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. for those who have become dependent, DHMO withdrawal means certain death.  Dihydrogen monoxide:   is the major component of acid rain. contributes to the "greenhouse effect." may cause severe burns. contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape. accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals. may cause electrical failures and decrease effectiveness of automobile brakes. has been found in excised fumors of terminal cancer patients.   CONTAMINATION IS REACHING EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS Quantities of dihydrogen monoxide have been found in almost every stream, lake, and reservoir in America today. But the pollution is global, and the contamination has even been cound in Antartic ice. In the midwest alone, DHMO has caused millions of dollars in property damage.  Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:  as an industrial solvent and coolant. in nuclear power plants. in the production of Styrofoam. as a fire retardant. in many forms of cruel animal research. in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical. as an additive in certain "junk-foods" and other food products.  Companies dump waste DHMO into rivers and the ocean, and nothing can be done to stop them because this practice is still legal. The impact on wildlife is extreme, and we cannot afford to ignore it any longer!  THE HORROR MUST BE STOPPED The American government has refused to ban the production, distribution, or use of this damaging chemical due to its "importance to the economic health of this nation." In fact, the navy and other military organizations are conducting experiments with DHMO, and designing multi-billion dollar devices to control and utilize it during warfare situations. Hundreds of military research facilities receive tons of it through a highly sophisticated underground distribution network. Many store large quanities for later use.  IT'S NOT TOO LATE Act NOW to prevent further contamination. Find out more about this dangerous chemical. What you don't know CAN hurt you and others throughout the world.

      Here are two articles I found in the paper this week.    John Grogan | An oasis of sanity on gay marriage  By John Grogan  Inquirer Columnist   I came to the historic riverfront town of New Hope expecting to find Gomorrah on the Delaware, its populace turned to pillars of salt for daring to so brazenly embrace homosexual union.  But on Friday, three days after the Borough Council unanimously voted in favor of gay marriage, all was quiet.  Tourists - the few who were out on this blustery day - strolled the cobblestone lanes. Shoppers browsed. Carpenters hammered. Bakers baked. Waiters waited on lunch customers.  Not a salt pillar in sight.  Up and down the streets, residents and workers reacted the same way to last Tuesday's resolution, which read in part: "Now, be it hereby resolved that the New Hope Borough Council supports the issuance of marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples and calls upon the County of Bucks and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to issue such licenses."  They said it was no big deal.  "To each their own," said P.J. Fischer, 27, a heterosexual who manages the clothing store Savioni. "Shouldn't they have a right to be happy?"  "I don't mind at all," said Kate Hudson, 26, of East Norriton, as she walked out of Starbucks. "I don't feel anyone has a right to tell anyone else how to live their lives."  At Gerenser's Exotic Ice Cream, manager Beau Johnson, 32, shrugged off the controversy. "I'm straight, but I have no problem with it," he said.  A tourist from Virginia added: "There shouldn't be a law against love."  Equal, but not quite  The council's vote came after a gay resident, Stephen Stahl, 54, stood up at Tuesday's council meeting and asked, as he put it, "a simple question: How do you apply for a marriage license?"  The answer, for those who seek to tie the knot with someone of the same sex, is, "You don't."  Despite that, Stahl and his partner of 28 years, Robert Seneca, 48, plan to force the issue today when they will attempt to seek a marriage license at the Bucks County Courthouse.  They know they will be turned away, they told me as we sat in Stahl's cozy writing studio on Main Street.  "It's really not about Robert and me," said Stahl, a playwright. "It's about [gay] people who will follow. In 25 years, we'll all be laughing about this. Things will change."  His partner added: "Just not soon enough."  Marriage, they said, carries certain guaranteed privileges, for instance involving taxes and inheritance and rights of survivorship. Their fight is about equal rights, but something more.  "It's about that word, marriage," Stahl said. "I'm looking for the word."  Stahl is a local Republican committeeman, but he said he would resign the post today in protest of what he sees as his party's radical reactionary swing under President Bush.  A small first step  Before heading out of town, I talked with two council members, Sharyn Keiser, a lesbian who has been in the same relationship for 17 years, and Ed Duffy, who is married. They agreed that little New Hope's journey into this divisive national issue is quixotic, yet worth taking.  "Are we going to turn things around immediately?" Keiser asked. "No. But we're making a statement that will be heard."  As an elected official, Duffy said, he can no longer sit back without insisting that gay couples "be able to enjoy the same rights as everyone else."  As I drove out of town, I found myself agreeing with him. This country was built on a healthy separation of church and state. No religion is forced to recognize, let alone bless, any marital union. The government, on the other hand, has an obligation to offer its legal institutions, including marriage, to all Americans, not just those who fit accepted social mores.  Substitute any other population group for denial - no white-black marriages, no Jewish-Gentile marriages, no native-immigrant marriages - and you have what this is really all about, which is prejudice.  Besides, given the divorce rate and the reckless whimsy with which so many straight couples march down the wedding aisle, homosexuals cannot possibly make a bigger mockery of the institution than we heterosexuals already have.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------     John Grogan | Where's the love? Missing in action  By John Grogan  Inquirer Columnist   Like many of the readers who responded to my Monday column on gay marriage, Bill from Lansdale was in a lather.  If homosexuals are allowed to wed, he argued, "then why not legalize bigamy? After all, it is possible that a man could love more than one woman or a woman more than one man. It's the same as a gay marriage. So we should legalize bigamy."  But Bill was not finished with his loping leaps of logic.  "And what about ménage À trois? Why can't that be legalized, too? After all, isn't that about love?"  From there it was just a hop, jump and a skip to opening the institution of marriage to incest, bestiality and every other deviant act on the books.  In case I might be missing his sarcasm, Bill spelled out his point for me: "A wrong does not make a right."  In Bill's eye and the eyes of many others I heard from, gay marriage is just that: wrong.  James (I'm withholding last names to protect my correspondents from self-humiliation) darkly hypothesized that if gays are allowed to marry, "the human race disappears in two generations. Is that what you want?"  Gosh, no, James. But I'm counting on the 90-odd percent of the population that is heterosexual to do what heterosexuals have always done, regardless of what happens with gays - and that is to keep churning out babies like there is no tomorrow.  The natural order  Wrote another: "Dogs and cats cannot marry; fish and lobsters cannot marry; fathers and sons cannot marry - and two women or two men cannot marry. The reason is simple. Marriage is all about a man and a woman and the natural order of things to continue the species."  That's funny. When former stripper Anna Nicole Smith married billionaire J. Howard Marshall, then 89, in 1994, I don't think perpetuating the species was exactly on her Top 10 list.  The same person, who did not sign his note, added: "This is all about legitimizing and normalizing a behavior that is way outside the natural order of things."  To which I give you the short-lived but highly celebrated marriage of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley.  George from Springfield said the issue of equal rights is a red herring. "It's just a means of camouflaging their real agenda: They want to be treated like normal people, which I don't think they are."  Another caller simply shouted into the phone: "It's abnormal! Government should not recognize abnormality!"  You mean as opposed to normal people like Britney Spears, whose illustrious marriage lasted just long enough for the booze to wear off?  One e-mailer went so far as to suggest that if gays are allowed to marry, then society might as well allow child molesters to marry their young victims, too. Huh?  All right, people. Let's all take a deep breath and step back from the ledge. We're going to get through this.  The sky is not falling  Aren't we all being just a little silly? The "gay equals bigamy equals incest equals the end of the world" argument is the most comical of all.  Gays are not asking for permission to do anything other than what straight people are already able and encouraged to do. They don't want to marry their pets or Rolodex list or nephews. They ask only to be allowed to participate in the same legal union offered to heterosexuals.  How kinky is that? How does it open the door to state sanctioning of illegal sexual acts involving poodles and close blood relatives?  I keep coming back to what Sister Mary Noel taught us in second grade: "Judge people not by who they are, but by what they do."  If same-sex partners want to vow their monogamous love to each other, in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, till death do they part, I ask you: What is the big deal?  Will life as we know it really end?  Holy cow, Martha! Those gay people want to spend the rest of their days just like we are. Into the bunker!  Silly. It's just plain silly.  By inviting gays into the wedding club, society does not need to change the rules of marriage, only the definition of who is allowed to join.

      Well, I'm here in math class and I'm bored enough to post on this.   This weekend should be fun, I'm going with Biocoogana to record... at least for saturday, I'm not so sure about sunday, I'd need a ride, but that's very doubtful.   I don't really feel like saying anything personal, so that's pretty much everything.

      This weekend has been pretty sweet. Yesturday I was with Biocoogana at Dan's House (recording studio) all day. It was awesome, I can't wait to hear all the songs when they're done. Matt just called up to tell me they just finished recording and they're going to start mastering.   You might be thinking, "But Brian, you do EVERYTHING with Biocoogana, why aren't you there now?"  Good question. Go ask Dan why he didn't pick me up and didn't call to tell me he wouldn't pick me up.  But really, it's ok I guess... I'm just going to be really bored all day, because now I have NOTHING to do.   I guess it'll also be a suprise when I hear the finished recordings of the songs tomorrow. I nearly peed my pants when I was listening to Untied in the car with Bob and Steve. It sounded so freaking amazing... when it comes out, all of you had better buy it, because it's amazing.  Well I'm going to sit here for the next 5 hours, and then I'll go to sleep.

      So, I got a lot of sleep, but it was weird. I really didn't feel like being awake, so I went to bed at 11, and then I woke up at 3 and stayed up until 6.. and then I was kind of off and on sleeping until around 11:30. I think I had some weird dreams too, but I totally can't remember.   I got baptised yesturday! Woo! Now, if anyone was planning on killing me but didn't know the right time, they can go right now. It's all good, I'm goin' to heaven! Just so you know, I'm just joking about all that. I did get baptised, but I really don't see that as a reason to go to heaven or whatever. 'Cause then Jewish people wouldn't get into heaven, and that's just weird.   Enough religious stuff, that's boring.  Well, now I'm awake, I should eat something sometime soon.

      ALL RIGHT! New plans... Vicki and Matt and I just saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind... it was incredible, I loved it. It made me feel really emo though...   And tomorrow after I'm done babysitting, I'm going to see Against Me! with Matt.

      Ok... so today just died. Matt doesn't have a ride to movie day, and even if he did he'd have to go home early for dinner... so today's going to be boring and suck. Maybe.. just maybe if we can, we'll see a movie after Matt's done his dinner that's more important than movie day.

      All right... So this week is going to be pretty fun. Yesturday I went to Vicki's with Matt, and we watched Family Guy all day, and a LITTLE bit of City Of The Lost Children. We stopped watching that because we were all falling asleep, and you can't really be falling asleep while watching it. Vicki and Matt always make me do EVERYTHING for them... like yesturday I walked all the way to Pepperoni's in the freezing wind to get them pizza and soda... but, I didn't pay, so I guess that makes up for not paying.   Today, I have a piano lesson, and then I get to go to Vicki's with Matt and have another movie day. Chances are they'll be asking me to walk to Matt's house or something crazy like that.   Tomorrow, I have to watch my little sister all day. I WAS going to go see Against Me! with Matt, but now I can't. I'm just going to be freaking bored all day. UNLESS Matt and Vicki decide to stop by my house... Which won't happen.  Thursday I'm getting baptised, which is going to be pretty sweet. Vicki's coming to watch me get baptised... I wonder what she'll think of my church. Well, that's really all I'm doing on Thursday, but I have to be at church at 5, because I missed the service last sunday where they told the people being baptised how to do it and everything. It'll be over at 8, maybe I'll just get some extra sleep that night.  Friday, another movie day with Vicki and Matt. We'll probably have to rent movies if we watch anything, because pretty soon they'll have seen all the movies I own. And again, I'm pretty sure they'll make me do something ridiculous.. they like that.  Saturday.. I don't know what's happening then... nothing I think.  And that's my week.

      Lynching: An American Tradition Comes to Iraq By Ahmed Nassef  "The events which transpired five thousand years ago, five years ago or five minutes ago, have determined what will happen five minutes from now, five years from now or five thousand years from now. All history is a current event." -- Dr. John Henrik Clarke, African American Historian  Whenever Muslims commit an atrocity against American citizens, we usually receive a lot of mostly anonymous hate mail. Here's one we got this morning in the wake of this week's killing of 4 Americans in Fallujah, Iraq:  "The News today confirmed followers of Islam are Satan's chosen people. What other religion hangs bodies from bridges then tears them apart? Hell has a special place for those people."  The letters we get make sense, since all Muslims--salafi or progressive, secular or Sufi, sunni or shi'i--as well as those in the population who may just "look" Muslim or are particularly adept at speaking Muslim must answer for the actions of any individual Muslim anywhere in the world.  Of course, this kind of thinking is exactly what leads to incidents like the one that took place in Fallujah. For many Iraqis, any American, by virtue of the passport they carry, becomes a walking representative of George Bush's invasion and military occupation of their country. The men who were burned to death and so inhumanely paraded around the streets of Fallujah were no longer humans in the eyes of the mob--they had no loved ones to grieve for them, no children to grow up fatherless without them.  Not long ago, similar scenes were rather regular occurrences in the United States despite having been erased from our collective memory. In fact, considering the sheer regularity and frequency of lynchings in America during the 19th and early 20th centuries, we as Americans should be able to relate rather well to the ugliness in Fallujah.  The American lynching tradition, which killed thousands, typically consisted of the following steps:  - a notice to other whites in neighboring towns, so they could witness the lynching;  - a huge spectacle with thousands watching;  - the burning of the victim, usually a male, at the stake, after first being exposed to hours of wrathful pain, known as "surgery below the belt;" and, as if that wasn't bad enough  - the observers took parts of the mutilated body as souvenirs and took pictures for postcards.  The parallels between what happened in Fallujah and the peculiarities of the American lynching tradition are remarkably striking.  Like their Iraqi counterparts, American lynchers liked to parade the charred corpses of their victims through the main streets of their towns.  One particularly gruesome image from Fallujah was the photo of the American victims being hung from a bridge over the Euphrates. The practice of hanging from bridges was also common in US lynchings:  http://www.muslimwakeup.com/mainarchive/images/fallujahlynching300.jpg  Researchers confirm the symbolic importance of lynching sites and the conscious selection of these sites by perpetrators of extra-legal violence. The dominance of Christian symbology is resurrected in the lynchers' preference for bodies of water, bridges, and landmark trees. Bodies of water are the traditional locations for baptisms; bridges symbolize the most profound rite of passage, the great "crossing over" to death; and trees are the very symbol of life and of Christ's crucifixion. The lynchers sought, in the conscious selection of these sacrificial sites and in their participation in these ritualized murders, their own salvation and passage to a safer place without sin and evil - both of which, in their minds, were physically embodied in the "offending" victim.  However, the similarities end when we consider the specific context of the Iraqi occupation.  The obvious one is that, unlike African Americans who were brought to the US against their will and had at least as much right to be here as their European American lynchers, almost all Americans in Iraq are there as a result of a highly questionable military invasion of a sovereign country.  Of course, most of the Americans that are there would rather not be. If given a choice, most US servicemen and women would eagerly return home to their families.  Which brings us to another disturbing trend--the increasingly common practice of transferring security and military duties to mercenary security services, from the US, as well as from England, South Africa, and Chile. In fact, the victims of Wednesday's attacks in Falluja worked for the same North Carolina firm, Blackwater, that is charged with the personal security detail of US Administrator L. Paul Bremer. Many of these "civilian" security jobs pay more than $15,000 per month--not quite close to the average GI's salary.  So who is responsible?  At one level, the people who partook in the heinousness of parading the bodies and disrespecting the dead are guilty. No matter their level of desperation or anguish, their actions are inexcusable.  But what about the people who, through their policy of hiring mercenaries, are blurring the lines between civilian and combatant, thus further endangering the many civilians who are in Iraq on humanitarian missions or to report the news? What about the people who brought us into this mess through a web of outright lies and half-truths? Are any of them accountable? Will any of them be brought to justice?  http://www.muslimwakeup.com/mainarchive/000680.php#more      People are so stupid... That one thing that one guy said, about Muslims being Satan's children? He must not know much about the history of CHRISTIANITY.

      Know what would be cool? To actually have self confidence... I wish I could just say what I'm thinking and not second guess everything I say. I'd say something, maybe I should, but what if... What if lots of things.. what if it just makes me look like an ass, what if things really ARE the way I think they are... There's nothing worse than being paranoid and then being proven right. Maybe now is the time when I should just grow some balls and say what I want to say, what's the worst that could happen, really. Well, I could find out that I'm right, and then I'd just totally hate myself.  Ugh.

      Four sins past sainthood, It's like I'm dying to forget All the sleepless nights, Lying perfectly alone and still. I can drink 'till victory, I'll drink to the mighty, Drink until I die, Or at least until the sunrise When honesty, As popular as a plague, Comes to remind me The dead's winning the race With me going nowhere. Right down the street, A prostitute is selling The closest thing to love That this country has to offer, And Alachua still sleeps tonight, And Alachua still sleeps tonight, And Alachua still sleeps tonight...  So we fought for the republic While the Catholic sun filled every eye. From the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, We drank to the mighty. We died for oil, We died for borders, Killed for democracy, Still believed every platform. Can you handle the death, Accept what we create together? I still know every politician Is a fucking monster. Culture kills bureaucrats And all other undesireables. History said we died for freedom, But today no justice was served, And America still sleeps tonight, And America still sleeps tonight, And America still sleeps tonight, And I hope it doesn't wake up tomorrow.  So we boasted that we were champions, Each country singing it's own praise. Like a rock thrown into the ocean, Humanity was rising to the top. Two world wars later, Countless "military interventions", We erect monuments to history And give apologies to the dead. All that was fought for the living Is quickly forgotten. We don't remember the dates, We don't remember the reasons. We have no idea what's going on, Building histories of western corporations. It doesn't even turn my stomach To see the pictures of atrocities anymore, Going numb in the new order Of the new century. And Alachua still sleeps tonight, And America still sleeps tonight, And the world still sleeps tonight...  And Alachua still sleeps tonight... And America still sleeps tonight... And the world still sleeps tonight...

      	In front of me a TV game show is playing on MUTE and my head rests on top of my hands, as though I am praying, but I am not; I am rubbing my eyes and trying to wake up, and my hair is brushing the tabletop which is covered in crumbs and I am thinking to myself that, in spite of everything that has happened in my life, I have never lost the sensation of always being on the brink of some magic revelation-that  if only  I would look closely enough at the world, then that magic revelation would be mine- if only  I could wake up just that little bit more...    	And on the TV there were still more birds! Such lovely creatures and I thought that we are so lucky to have the animals. What act of goodness did we as humans once commit to deserve such kindness from God?    	And then there was that same news story again about Superman's dying-except I realized I got the city wrong-he's supposed to die over  Metropolis , not Minneapolis. But I was still sad. I have always liked the idea that there is one person in the world who doesn't do bad things. And that there is one person in the world who is able to fly.    	I don't know what it was about myself that your mother found lovable. I guess whatever it was is not enough to overcome the things she is feeling now.    	Brent said, "Hey-you're always interpreting your dreams. Here's an idea-why not try something else. Why not interpret your everyday life as though  it  were a dream, instead. Say to yourself, 'A plane's flying overhead now- What does this mean? ' Say to yourself, 'It's raining so much lately- What does this mean? ' Say to yourself, 'Today I thought I had rediscovered Laurie-but it turned out it was someone else instead.  What does this mean?'  I think this makes life an easier thing. I really do.    	A week later, around six at night, Dana phoned me up-I'm not hard to reach: my phone number has been the same for almost ten years-and he was obviously at a pay phone, with cars and trucks roaring in the background. 	"It's me," he said. 	"I figured. You okay?" 	A pause. "Absolutely." 	I tried to make conversation and felt vaguely like I was in a quiet room with somebody on terminal life support. "Your wife seems nice," I said. 	"I pray for you," he replied. 	"Oh," I said. "Uh-thanks." 	"I pray for you because you have no faith and hence no soul." 	"Hey Danester-I may be faithless, but I'm not without a soul. I'll thank you not to patronize me, either." 	"God is descending into the suburbs, Scout. We never expected judgment in our time, but it is going to happen." 	"Dana? What's the deal?" 	"The time is coming, Scout. You will not have to live inside linear time anymore; the concept of infinity will cease to be frightening. All secrets will be revealed. There will be great destruction; structures like skyscrapers and multinational corporations will crumble. Your dream life and your real life will fuse. There will be music. Before you turn immaterial, your body will turn itself inside out and fall to the ground and cook like steak on a cheap hibachi and you will be released and you will be judged." 	"Um-Dana... I think I have somebody on call waiting. Can I phone you back?" 	"You may be driving in a car when it happens. YOu may be shopping in a fashionable store. You may be..." 	"Hey Dana. Gotta go.  Caio ." 	And there is Dana.    	Sometimes I want to go to sleep and merge with the foggy world of dreams and not return to this, our real world... Sometimes I just feel that there must be another road that can be walked-away from this person I became-either against my will or by default.    	"Did I ever tell you," I said, "about the time last year in Stanley Park when Mark and I went rollerblading?" 	"No." 	"There was this group of blind people, with white canes and everything-a C.N.I.B. tour or something- and they heard us coming, and they motioned for us to stop, and we did. Then they handed Mark a camera. They asked Mark to take their picture." 	"Blind people?" 	"Exactly. But the strange thing was, they still believed in sight. In pictures. I'm thinking that's not a bad attitude."    	And that is my story until now. Here I now lie, on my stomach, looking out at the dark wet world, pulling the blanket tighter around me, smoking a cigarette, and knowing that this is the end of some aspect of my life, but also a beginning-the beginning of some unkown secret that will reveal itself to me soon. All I need to do is ask and pray.  	I stub out my cigarette, close the tent flaps, and lay back on the ground sheet on top of the soil. I close my eyes and prepare to sleep, but something underneath me nudges my spine. 	I reach my arms out of the flaps, into the rain, and underneath the ground sheet, where I pluck out a small object. I bring it back inside and feel it-it is a spruce pinecone. I smell it, cold and wet, and then hold it up to my cheek. I then stick my arm back outside the tent and plant the cone into the soil, just below the ground sheet.  	Time is how the trees grow. I will fall asleep for a thousand years, and when I wake, a mighty spruce tree will have raised me up high, high into the sky.   -Life After God

      Oh why cant I be what you need  a new improved version of me  but i'm nothing so good  no i'm nothing  just bones, a lonely ghost burning down songs of violence of love and of sorrow  i beg for just one more tomorrow  where you hold me down fold me in  deep deep deep in the heart of your sins   I break in two over you  I break in two  And each piece of me dies  And only you can give the breath of life  But you dont see me, you dont...   here i'm in between darkness and light  bleached and blinded by these nights  where im tossing and tortured til dawn  by you, visions of you then youre gone  the shock lifts the red from my face  when i hear someone's taking my place  how could love be so thoughtless, so cruel  when all, all that i did was for you   i break in two over you  i break in two  and each piece of me dies  and only you can give the breath of life  but you dont see me you dont..   i break in two over you  i break in two  and each piece of me dies  and only you can give the breath of life  but you dont see me you don't...   i break in two over you  i break in two over you, over you  i break in two  i would break in two for you  now you see me  now you don't  now you need me  now you don't    From Autumn to Ashes is amazing...

      Listening to From Autumn To Ashes, I just bought The Fiction We Live, and it's some pretty good stuff. One of my favorite parts on the cd is in Alive Out Of Habit, where the more melodic singer sings, "I said that I don't need you,  BUT I'M A LIAR! I SWEAR I DO! . It's just one of those moments where you're like, "Holy crap yes" Like in Untied by Biocoogana right after they do that, "Once again it's back to nothing at all And nothing's all we've got to hold on to Should I be waiting For what I can't pursue" and Kris is playing the Piano thing and Steve's soloing, and Dan comes in with, "How Can You See!" and then the drums hit and the horns come in and it's like "WHOA". But, of course, you all wouldn't know about that considering you haven't heard the recording of Untied yet... when you do, you'll pee yourself.

      Drum corps today.... ugh... I REALLY don't want to go.    So, I never really made a post about my birthday. It was fun, here's what I got: CDs: Against Me!: As The Eternal Cowboy Planes Mistaken For Stars: Planes Mistaken For Stars Owls: Owls Joan of Arc: A Portable Model Of Bright Eyes and Neva Dinova: One Jug Of Wine, Two Vessels Pedro The Lion: Control New Amsterdams: Never You Mind Movies:  The Princess and the Warrior. Made by the same people who did Run Lola Run, has a lot of the same actors from Run Lola Run too. Very very good movie.  The Believer. I had already seen this, but it's such a great movie. It's about a Jewish Nazi, and it's one of my all time favorites. Lost In Translation. EXTREMELY good. I had heard mixed things about it, but it was very good. You won't really like it if you're too cynical or too "emo" or whatever. All Quiet on the Western Front. I got the book too. I was bored today, so I watched the movie. I really want to read the book now. Very good movie, great acting, good storyline, etc.  I got some clothes and other stuff, but I don't feel like typing about that.   I might be getting my head shaved while I'm at corps too. Andrew Yetter told me last camp if I didn't get my hair cut this week, he would do it. And I decided I didn't want to waste the time/money on getting someone else to cut it some ugly way, so I'll just let him buzz my head. It'll probably look like crap, but I have no one to impress, I really don't care what anyone thinks anymore. It's not like getting an ugly haircut will make any more people not like me.    Well, I'm gonna eat soon, and then go to Auschwitz, I mean drum corps.

      I ordered some stuff from Amazon, and all but two things came yesturday, just thought I should do a post about it.   I got two movies, Mulholland Drive, which I've already seen, and Swimming Pool. Swimming Pool is pretty decent, it was interesting and the ending was kind of suprising and confusing. Mulholland Drive is fucking amazing.  Next, a new pair of headphones, the ones I had before broke after like, a week... these ones should last longer.  And last, I got Death Cab For Cutie: Transatlanticism, and I've gotta say I love it. I think I'll post some lyrics.  "Title and registration"  The glove compartment isn't accurately named And everybody knows it. So I'm proposing a swift orderly change.  Cause behind its door there's nothing to keep my fingers warm And all I find are souvenirs from better times Before the gleam of your taillights fading east To find yourself a better life.  I was searching for some legal document As the rain beat down on the hood When I stumbled upon pictures I tried to forget And that's how this idea was drilled into my head  Cause it's too important To stay the way it's been  There's no blame for how our love did slowly fade And now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all And here I rest where disappointment and regret collide Lying awake at night  There's no blame for how our love did slowly fade And now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all And here I rest where disappointment and regret collide Lying awake at night (up all night) When I'm lying awake at night.

      Five times out of a hundred. Tell me what my odds are, my heart isn't working. Five times out of a hundred. Tell me what my chance is, romance is under rated. Stare on. Don't let a glance be too short. Don't stop. Glances are a playground. Stay around the sound of laughing boys. Walk on around the table making noise. Stare on! Oh no? I wanna turn the bathtub on and watch this house drown from the lawn. I wanna turn this energy on.

      Just finished my 5 page Lobo paper, I'm proud of me.   I got a couple things from Amazon on Tuesday, A Modest Promise: Confessing My Love To The Firing Squad. Great cd, there isn't a song I don't like on it. I also go the movie May, which is fucked up, for serious. It's not too scary, it's just really fucking creepy. It's a great movie though.   So, today was a half day at school because of graduation. After school I went to graduation for my sister, and it was ok. I came home and wrote like a page of the Lobo paper, and then we went to dinner. After THAT, I wrote a little more, and then Erin got some presents and stuff... Then I finished it.  I probably could've said that in a way that didn't sound so stupid, but hey, I'm tired. I can't wait for school to be over. I have no idea what the fuck I'm going to do with my life once school is over, when I'm not at drum corps that is...  Well, I'm off to bed, goodnight.

      I really can't fucking wait until school is over. It's SOOO close!  Well, right now I could be writting the Doyle essays, or working on that 5 page paper due friday, but instead I'm being lazy. Feeling pretty emo for one reason or another, listening to emo (The Commercials: Vince Is Dead. Great song).  TJ Jones is having some kind of party at his house and the cars are parked all the way up my street, it's some crazy shit. I think it's some kind of sports banquet thing, maybe for LAX as they call it.   I'm off.

      So, school is finally over!!! Thank god.    So, let me tell you about my past couple days.   Tuesday: I took my last two finals and then went to Pizza Hut with some friends and slept over at Mike Ferroni's house, and I saw This Is Spinal tap for the first time.   Today, I came back from Mike's and just hung around, then I rented a couple movies. 21 Grams, and God Is Great, and I'm Not.   21 Grams: Really really great movie. It was pretty depressing though. It's written in a really non-linear way, kind of like Memento, only it's a little more random. I think it really works though, and I thought it was very interesting. It had some great acting in it too.  God Is Great, and I'm Not: French movie staring Audrey Tautou (from Amelie). Probably the most realistic romantic movie I've ever seen. Audrey Tautou's character (Michelle) is a huge bitch to her boyfriend, and he tries to be nice but she twists around everything he says. It's a good movie though.   And now I'm sitting here, and I'm really bored.

      I had two of my finals today, LA and Math... They were both fairly easy, I kind of went blank on some of the math problems though.  In the room where my LA final was, there were like, swarms of flying ants, and it was SO fucking gross! You'd look up at the lights and see them all swarming around and shit. One landed on my desk, it was pretty gross.   Since the school year is over, I have all my tv/computer time back... So, I'll be on a lot more now.   So, now that summer vacation is about to start, what the fuck am I going to do with my time??

      I just went out to the movies with some friends and saw Saved!    Saved!: Holy crap, this is one funny freaking movie. It makes fun of the people that I CAN'T STAND, and has a bunch of amazing puns that you kind of have to listen for. For example, this girl (Mary) is waiting for her boyfriend to come out of the house so she can give him a ride to school. So, she gets out of her friend's car and walks up to her boyfriend's house. His parents answer the door and they tell her that they found a gay porn magazine under his bed. When she gets back into the car, her friends ask, "So, is he coming out?"  Woo, that's a good one.  The only problem is we had to drive out to King of Prussia to see it, because it's not showing anywhere around here. From what I heard, it's only really playing there and at the Ritz, I'd say it's worth the trip though.

      I saw two more movies. 13 Conversations About One Thing and Amores Perros.    13 Conversations About One Thing: You might be thinking, what is that one thing? Happiness. And for a movie about happiness, this movie is really depressing. It's one of those movies where if someone asks, "What's it about?" you can't give an answer without giving away the movie. It's a very good movie, one of those movies you have to piece together to find out what's happening, and they show different people's storys and how they all fit together.    Amores Perros (Love's a Bitch): It's a pun because there's a dog in every story in the movie. Same idea as 13 Conversations, only in Spanish and it has a totally different plot. It even has the same "you-see-a-car-crash-and-don't-know-who's-getting-hit-but-find-out-later" thing. Yeah, it's a LOT like 13 Conversations About One Thing. This is also fairly depressing. It's also a really great movie. You need to be really used to watching movies with substance to really appreciate this movie.

      More movie reviews:    House of Sand and Fog: Now here's my kind of movie. It has some great actors in it: Jennifer Connelly, who has been in some of my favorite movies (A Beautiful Mind, Dark City, Requiem For A Dream); Ben Kingsley (Gandhi) , very believable, when you see him at the very end (I don't want to give it away), you'll cry. The Director of Photography who worked on A Beautiful Mind also worked on this movie. So, if you've seen A Beautiful Mind, you know what kinds of amazing shots you can expect. I really loved this movie. It's very emotional, and very moving. I like watching drama's that make me feel something.

      So, I started up my two month subscription to Netflix that my granny got me for Christmas. I already have like, 40 movies set up to watch. I got my first 3 movies on Sunday: Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels; Mystic River; and House of Sand and Fog.   Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels: Had a lot of similarities to Snatch (another movie made by the same people), and that's not a bad thing. It's a funny entertaining movie. It's interesting to watch, I don't know what else to say.  Mystic River: This movie is such a piece of shit. What a waste of 2 and a half hours. I start watching it, and I notice that the dialogue sucked. The begining is just some early character development kind of thing, it shows their childhood etc. I figured that it was just going to suck for that part of the movie. Nope, I was wrong, the dialogue BLOWS throughout the whole movie. I think the acting really suffers, because they don't have much to work with. All the acting seemed really over done and not believable at all. I've seen Sean Penn act in better movies (21 Grams for example), and he should not have won an Oscar for this movie. It's not he's a bad actor, it's just what he was working with makes his acting worse, if that makes any sense. It's an interesting story, but HORRIBLY told. Netflix description of it is, "Three childhood friends, Sean (Kevin Bacon), Dave (Tim Robbins) and Jimmy (Sean Penn) are reunited in Boston 25 years later when they are linked together in the murder investigation of Jimmy's daughter. This taut thriller from director Clint Eastwood won two Oscars (Robbins and Penn) and was nominated for several more in its exploration of human behavior when faced with pain just beneath the surface, justified rage, and scars that never heal." Now, the whole bit about exloration of human behavior shit, that might mean something if this was a true story. It's just a fucking story, it MIGHT have moved me if the script wasn't so aweful. Anyone can make up a story to show anything. I could make a movie about how love is the only thing that matters and make up some fake thing about some situation where that would be the case. But it doesn't mean that could actually happen in real life, and if it can't really happen in real life, then why would it move me? Don't see this movie. I think that it was probably a MUCH better book, and it probably should've stayed that way.

      We had our preview show for LVK this weekend, and we got new uniforms. The corps director and his wife made all of them, which is a ridiculous amount of work. He does so much for the corps. One day he bought the entire corps water ice. There were like, 50 kids in the corps when he did that, and he payed right out of his pocket.    urlLink    New Uniforms&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink    New Uniforms2&nbsp; urlLink

      Boat Trip: I rented this against my better judgement, I have to say. Someone reccommended this, so I decided that I'd watch it. This movie is really freaking bad. The acting is so aweful and the plot is so predictable, but I'm not going to lie, I laughed. There were like, 4 jokes in the movie that had me laughing pretty hard. A lot of the movie is pretty funny, actually. It's not like Dodgeball funny though. This is one of those movies that actually DOES have a plot, so I can give a little description of what it's about. Jerry (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Nick (Horatio Sanz) sign up to go on a cruise. They end up getting in an arguement with the travel agent, so he books them on a gay cruise. Oh, nd by the way, there are lots of boobies.

      Ok, I just watched two movies, they're really similar.   The Virgin Suicides: Set in the 70's, group of sisters, SUPER over protective parents.  Thirteen: Set in modern times, one girl, kind of relaxed single mother.   Now, the problem in both these movies is female teenage angst. The two ways of dealing with it are, being over protective, or not being protective enough. It's really funny I ended up watching these both back to back. It's really two different sides of the story. I think that to an extent, parenting can be to blame in these situations, but to an extent. It's so easy to blame the parents, or blame society, but there's a point when it's actually the child's fault, and there's nothing the parents can do. The problem I found with both these movies is they present a problem, show what not to do, but they don't show what you SHOULD do. I don't really think there's anything someone CAN do in a situation like that. That's a really hard thing to do I can imagine. Just knowing that because you're having a kid you'll have to walk on thin ice through their teenage years and hope the don't kill themselves or have lots of sex or anything else that's irreversible. But back to the blame thing.. You could say in The Virgin Suicides it's the parent's fault for being over protective, and I do think that's a large part of it. And in Thirteen you could blame the mother for not being a good enough role model. And again, I think that's a large part of it. You can't really help what friend's your kid has though, and all those other outside factors that a parent really can't control. Well, they were both good movies. I'd reccommend them to anyone who's not a straight guy.

       urlLink Moore, in bending facts, documents a fantasy   To call Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 a work of fiction is to miss the point. It's a documentary, but whereas most documentaries document the truth, Moore's film is documenting a fantasy.  With his false documentaries, Moore fills a need. His work is there for people immune to evidence and fact. Moore and his audience are there for each other, functioning as a support group that reinforces the willful belief in things that do not exist and are not so.  It's been said (flippantly) that being a member of the radical left is, as with communism and socialism, evidence of a mental illness. But with Fahrenheit 9/11, flippancy isn't called for. We are talking mass delusion here. Millions of people are unable to deal with certain facts - that, say, Bush is a popular, effective, exemplary wartime leader; that his administration, while it may have made some errors, is not the sink of iniquity we saw with Bill Clinton; that the war in Iraq, though fraught with difficulty, is succeeding and will make the world better. Unable to deal with these facts, Moore and others like him create a separate reality, one of shady conspiracies between the Bush family and the Saudis, of deliberate attempts to mislead the American people so the trigger-happy Bush could go to war, of a war the United States, despite victory after victory, is shown to be losing. Alternative reality.  Mind you, these people are not mentally ill because they're leftists; they are leftists because they're miswired from the start. Since Moore and his fans live in an alternate reality, it doesn't matter how many times and by how many insiders and experts their view has been disproved to them.  When the unwell individual isn't able - through legislating, lobbying or voting - to make reality accord with his mental world, this prototype sets off for Hollywood, where there is a sea of others like him, who have studios at their disposal. That's how the public ends up with TV shows such as The West Wing and movies like The American President. Fantasies of the successful liberal presidency.  Except now, with the advent of Michael Moore, the presentation has become more insidious, with this new genre of pseudo-documentary. Unfortunately, the Academy Awards have no such category, so it's likely that Moore again will be a nominee for Best Documentary (though he won't be a shoo-in this time). To accommodate works like Moore's, the Academy should consider creating a new category, perhaps titled "Fantasy Documentary."        Ok, so now people with different opinions are crazy? I don't know, but for some reasons I'd think that someone who can't accept difference at all is a little more crazy than us liberals. I don't think my conservative friends are crazy just because they don't believe what I believe. It's easy to SAY stuff like, "It's been said (flippantly) that being a member of the radical left is, as with communism and socialism, evidence of a mental illness", but where the fuck is the evidence to support that? There is no evidence! Fahrenheit 9/11 could actually BACK UP it's crazy ideas with some kind of vague proof at least. And it's easy to say it's all made up and all fake, but where's the proof? And to say that Michael Moore and other crazy liberals have "who have studios at their disposal" is bullshit. Fahrenheit 9/11 was turned down by a number of movie studios before it went to Lions Gate. What's really funny is saying that Clinton is worse than Bush. Clinton did what plenty of men ALL OVER THE WORLD do. Now, I'm not saying that's right, but it's nothing compared to Bush. Bush cut back on benefits for soldiers and veterans. Bush hasn't exactly been helping the environment either. He's also against gay marriage, which, I admit, can be debated as something that makes Bush a bad president. Bush also started a war with another country and killed innocent people. All of the reasons for having that war are bullshit. People say, "Saddam killed all those Kurds! It's horrible! He deserves to die for that." A couple things, since when have you ever given a fuck about people other than yourself? I agree, it IS horrible, and something SHOULD'VE been done about it. But why Iraq? Look at Africa! Look at the fucking Congo. There's racial violence a hundred times worse than what happened to the Kurds. Why aren't we helping them? Because the Congo doesn't sit on top of the second largest oil supply in the world. WMD's? Don't exist. What about the Osama Saddam connection? Yes, they're both arab, but truthfully, they hated each other. I know people don't like Michael Moore, and I can honestly see why. Just because he believe something different, it doesn't mean he's crazy.

Everything goes so fast and people's mood's change in less than a second. Since I really have no idea what real meth addicts are like, I don't really know if this is "honest" or not. People have compared it to Requiem For A Dream, and they do have a lot of similarities. Spun is a lot more fast paced, and it's less a lot brighter, and generally less depressing. By the end, I definately felt sorry for Nikki and Ross, not everyone else so much. They're so deluded, and they have no judgement at all... There's one scene where they're both in Ross's car and they're saying all these things about how great their life is, but it's not true. It's really pathetic and sad to watch. It's a really good movie, it really stays with you after you watch it too.

      Brazil: This isn't my typical "artsy with no plot" movie. I'm not really sure what to say about it. It's VERY Terry Gilliam. Lots of weird British humor. The story really reminded me of 1984. It's the same kind of distopian society idea. It's really good, very clever. It's not too hard to understand, although it is pretty weird.

      Fahrenheit 9/11: I just saw this tonight at the Ritz.. That is one powerful movie. I'd love to post everything from the movie, but my memory is horrible... And Michael Moore is so much more articulate than me. Go see this movie, if you don't want to cry, and you don't get angry at Bush, you probably don't have a heart. I know it's just liberal propaganda. It's just the truth slanted a certain way, but it's still a piece of the truth, which makes it true. Michael Moore gets you all emotional with people's stories and videos... And it just makes you feel so sad... All these people crying and suffering... And then they show a clip of Bush, and it makes you want to tear his face off. I really think that Bush is just a huge tool. He doesn't really know what he's doing, he's just a big dumb face.  Towards the end, Michael Moore quoted 1984, and the similarities are terrifying... In the begining they told a story of a guy who said something about Bush being an asshole to his friends at the gym, and then they told the FBI... How Hitler Youth is that.

      Sex and Lucia: I rented this because whenever I look for movies, this always comes up as a reccomendation. I really wasn't expecting much, something like a bad Spanish drama without an interesting plot, and also filmed really horribly. But holy shit was I wrong. This movie has everything I look for in movies. The cinematography was amazing, the plot was non-linear (not as confusing or random as Amores Perros or 21 Grams, but still jumps around a bit), it had romance, it had emotion, and something that's creepy and unsettling but not scary. And yeah, it had sex. It's a lot different from other movies with sex though. With other movies it's suposed to be all "erotic" and "steamy" and all that shit. But the sex in this movie felt really romantic and sweet. You could even say it was cute. Maybe that's just me feeling extra emo tonight. It's a great movie though, one of my favorites now.

      Rain: For some reason all the "teenage girl coming of age movies" came like, back to back. This one was different from The Virgin Suicides and Thirteen. It's a LOT more emotional. It moved a LITTLE too slow at times, but I don't think it really took away from the movie. The ending was really powerful, the acting was great. The little girl (Alicia Fulford-Wierzbicki) was just amazing. She didn't really have too much to act with in the beginning, just a lot of monotone angsty preteen stuff, but the ending was just... wow.

      So... um, for those of you who don't know, my grandmother has been in the hospital for the past month. She came back home for a week, but now she's back at the hospital. So, my mom tells me this morning that she's doing worse and she's going to die. She might die today, she might make it to the end of the summer. Either way, I won't be seeing Grandma at Christmas time, or Amanda's Birthday, or anything like that. And all I can do with the knowledge that my grandmother's dying is buy a suit.  fucking cancer.

      The Professional: I saw a little bit of this movie at Matt's house, so I decided to watch the whole thing. It's a great action movie, directed by Luc Besson who directed The Fifth Element, and some other French films. It's a good movie, not much else to say.

      Eddie Izzard: Dress To Kill  Ok, I'm not really sure how to punctuate this, because there has to be a ":" in between "Eddie Izzard" and "Dress To Kill"... but then I can't start the review with a ":". So, I'll just do it this way. Eddie Izzard has to be the funniest stand up comic I've ever seen. I KNOW that someone's going to IM me or something (if anyone actually reads this) and be like, "Oh! But ______ is so funny blah blah blah" Well, I don't care. Eddie Izzard is a transvestite, excuse me, EXECUTIVE transvestite, and the best thing is his show isn't centered around that. He does a couple jokes in the beginning about being a transvestite, and then he moves on. His jokes are so original and intelligent, it's crazy. He talks about European and American history, and even though some of the things he talks about are kind of cliche (Native Americans being in America when the British landed), he says them in ways that are totally different. This is so much better than all the typical comedians, like the gay one who makes the straight jokes, the black one who makes the white jokes, and the female one who makes the male jokes. This is so much better than the dumb comedian who goes, "What about the word _______? [audience laughs] I mean, how did they come up with that? Was someone one day like, 'I think I'll say ______' [audience laughs]. Wouldn't it make more sense if it was _______? I mean really, what's up with that." I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking for something funny.

      So, here's an update:  I'm grounded for two days because I left the doors open in the house before I went to a concert (Blood Brothers) last night. I think it's fucking retarded that I'm getting grounded for that. No one's going to come in the fucking house. But, I didn't argue... he's probably stressed enough with the whole grandmother deal. Besides, where would arguing get me? Nowhere. He's never grounded me before, I kind of think he just wants to see what happens or something. It's probably just him being stressed out. Oh well. The concert was good though.   The Butterfly Effect: Like most people, I was a little worried about seeing Ashton Kutcher in a serious role. But, fuck, he does it amazing. This is one depressing movie. Very emotional... not much more I can say without giving something away. My only problem was with the DVD, it has all these crazy interesting features, but no subtitles. I thought that was just kind of stupid.

      Wow, I can't believe I leave for tour tomorrow. The season went by so fast...  I'm really excited about tour too. I'm looking forward to it a lot more now that I have Lauren. God, she's incredible.&nbsp;I'm still trying to figure out WHY she likes me... she could definately do better than me.  Here's a little piece from her Livejournal:  "right so our show was cancelled today, because it was POURING. im talking like.. MONSOONit was INSANE. we were out practicing in this monsoon, half naked as usual, FREEZING cold, like.. no exaggeration... our lips were turning purple. the flags were completely saturated, so they were impossible to toss... it was wicked fun though.so i leave for tour this wednesday.... ill be gone for like.... ever.....  &nbsp; i really like brian. hes really sweet. i like that."  I have no idea how I can be so lucky right now... tour is like 20 days long, and I really don't want it to end. Even though she lives like, 20 minutes from me, it's still a lot farther away than right next to me on&nbsp;a gym floor. I don't want to lose that.&nbsp;I honestly hate the idea of going weeks without seeing her.   I also hate how I have all these ideas and feelings and shit, but I can't think of how to put them together so they make sense. This&nbsp;whole post&nbsp;doesn't flow at all. Oh well.   Ok, I'm done being emo.

      Waking Life: Now, if you've ever seen one of the movies I like and say, "This doesn't have&nbsp;a plot" you have no idea. This is the epitome of plotless movie. Incredibly interesting, but I don't think I know&nbsp;many other people who would enjoy this movie as much as I did. Seriously, don't watch it because you'll just make fun of me for liking it. It's pretty much animated conversations about existance and dreaming. It's a LOT like Slacker, if you've ever seen it. And, not too suprisingly, it's made by the same guy, Richard Linklater. What DID suprise me though, is he also directed School of Rock. The animation style took a little getting used to, it seemed a lot like it was actually filmed once, but then changed... like, the movements and everything seemed&nbsp;very real... Ok,&nbsp;I just watched the making of, and&nbsp;that is the&nbsp;case. They have this computer program&nbsp;that lets&nbsp;them animate over digital footage.. It's pretty much a philosophy movie, and if that isn't your thing, you'll hate this. I'm specificly thinking about&nbsp;you, Matt Coons, don't see this movie.&nbsp;Well.. it's good, but don't see it.

      Ok, movie update. &nbsp; &nbsp; Euro Trip: I saw this with Mike and Matt, and I'm only putting this in here 'cause those dumb motherfuckers asked me too. What a shitty movie. The really sad thing was Boat Trip, the movie about a gay cruise, had less MALE nudity, and more FEMALE nudity... Euro Trip= waste of time.  &nbsp; Mike's house was fun anyway...&nbsp;I was kind of cranky in the morning though. &nbsp; &nbsp; Pulp Fiction: Pretty good movie. I can tell that a lot of movies got their ideas from this. Too bad I've already seen all of them so it doesn't seem as cool and original as it could. Anyway, it's still really good. &nbsp; &nbsp; Sleepy Hallow: What an incredible collection of great cast and crew. Just a FEW of the amazing actors: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Christopher Walken, and many more. And then director Tim Burton, executive producer Francis Ford Coppla, and the special effects were done by Industrial Light and Magic or whatever the company is called. Incredible stuff, good movie.

      Woo, that was a night for the history books.  So, Mike and Matt pick me up around 8ish to go to Mike's and watch movies. So after they get me, we go to pick up Kyle. Once we got to Kyle, we heard some bubbling noises under the hood of Mike's car, so we went to Kyle's neighbor's house to see if he knew what was wrong. When we went over to get him, he was in his driveway welding. That was a good sign that he'd probably know what to do. It turns out Mike's car overheated, so we left it in the parking lot. So Matt's dad drove us to Mike's, and then we used another car to drive to Blockbuster, where we go Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, and we seriously watched it. Good times. So after that, they played some video games or something until around... 4ish maybe. At around 5:40, Kyle decided to go outside for a morning run, so he went out and started doing laps around Mike's property. After a while, Mike and Matt and I decided to join him. Mike and I were ONLY wearing boxers, and Matt had boxers and a shirt on. So we did a few laps around Mike's property, and Mike and I decided to keep running until a car drove by, and one did. We stood outside for a little, and decided we should go eat breakfast at Tom Jones. Dan left his Confederate States of America hat at Mike's house, so I decided to wear that when I went. So we put some clothes on and drove to Tom Jones, while I looked like a dirty hick. We all had Blue Platter Specials (best fucking deal EVER) and then drove back home, and slept a little.   Fun times.

      Well, I just got back from tour... it was pretty fun. I would do like a whole outline of what happened, but... I really can't remember anything. I'm totally dead right now. Being on a bus for 30 some hours actually went a lot faster than I thought it would, and I only slept like, 5 minutes the first night, and 6 the second night.  Well, that's all for now.
