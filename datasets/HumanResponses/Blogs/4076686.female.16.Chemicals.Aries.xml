      do u gugs know how things sux so much???????????????????????????? i fullly hate it when ppl misrepresent lyrics, its just NOT funni take this example:  *evanescene's  Tourniquet ~  the misrepresented lyrics are "  i may die and im pouring out crimson regrets and betrayal " when the  real  lyrics   are  "   i lay dying and im pouring crimson regret and betryal "   *again, evanescence's  Everybody's Fool  ~ the so-called lyrics are " not for real that   you can save me " when the  real  lyrics are  "   ur not real and u can't save me  "          ok these are all just examples i found cos i happened to look up these lyrics but im just fully pissed that some ppl just dont bother buying the album to get their lyrics right.damnet.i dont mind burning CDs but i dont encourage wrong lyrics. full stop.     from a grumpy  evanescence  fan      [The Family]  rox!
