      On Saturday, my wife (Roseann) and daughter (Becca) and I went to the Fisher Price Toy Museum in East Aurora. It was fun to see their product line through the years and remember, "Hey, I used to have that!" or "I always wanted that..." There was also a gift shop featuring many classic toys (not just Fisher Price) such as the "seal on a stick", whose feet slap on the floor as you walk it, and the wind-up scuba diver.  There was a series of display cases showing Fisher Price's history and product development since the company was founded in 1931. It was particularly interesting to read the sign describing how in 1942 the government forced Fisher Price and other toy manufacturers to stop making toys and use their factories and materials for making supplies for the war effort. It gave me a deeper sense and appreciation for what a desperate time it was, and how determined our country was to defeat the enemy at any cost, that the very nature of our capitalistic free enterprise which we were fighting for would have to be usurped and ostensibly controlled by our government like that. It put me in mind of the Patriot Act, enacted at a very desperate time when our county is (or at least should be) determined to defeat the enemy of domestic terrorism, and how I hear so many people railing against it as though it were stripping us of our very freedoms. "The Practice", otherwise one of my favorite TV shows, made a regular habit of digging at the Patriot Act in its last season, and that is just one example of many critical voices against the legislation.  But I have to wonder... in the years since it was enacted, has anybody actually had any infringements or restrictions on their freedoms as a result? Can I get a show of hands? There seems to be a perception that any further rights of seach or investigation by our intelligence and law enforcement agencies constitutes an Orwellian oppression of human rights. But what is the reality? Who is really losing any possible amount of privacy and freedom?       It seems to me that the only people who could really suffer from the provisions of the Patriot Act are those who are under suspicion for being a danger to our society, or who have already broken the law in some way. Certainly our country provides many rights for suspected and accused criminals until they are proven guilty (and even provides them certain rights after that), but aren't our laws designed more to protect the innocent and law-abiding? Does the law-abiding, non-threatening populace have anything at all to fear as far as losing any freedoms or privacy from the provisions of the Patriot Act? I don't think so. Why are we so quick to cry out against this legislation and to jump to the defense of those who would break the law or conspire to harm the innocent and law-abiding?  Al Qaeda is currently plotting major strikes against our homeland. They are patient, persistent and very determined to do great harm to us. As in 1942, we will need to take some serious measures, measures which may seem in some ways to limit the very freedoms were trying to preserve, in order to preserve them. One suitcase nuke detonating in an American city and I'm quite sure that more of our freedoms will need to be sacrificed and restricted.  Many in the law enforcement community are saying that the Patriot Act has already been very helpful in tracking criminals and terrorist activities. I'm not sure that it's even enough to be as effective as we'll need to be to stop every threat, but in the sense that it is helping at all, I believe that it is a worthwhile ounce of prevention against a megaton of cure. If the kids of 1942 could go without new toys for a while, surely we can allow some of the rights of our suspected criminals to be squeezed a little, no?

      Hey all. I've always been outspoken about various things (for better or worse!), so I figured I'd get in on this blogging thing and let some thoughts spew. I'll probably end up adding some content from things I've already posted to newsgroups or web forums over the years, but I'll try to add some new stuff every few days at least.  First off, a thought that came to me recently, with the elections coming up and hearing the news reports of certain special interest groups "lending their support" to one candidate or another...  I think people in general vote with too much self-interest. The seniors are always pledging support for whoever will give them the most benefits and medical coverage... unions pledge support for whoever will back them, or pledge to pull support from whoever won't back them... etc. What happened to voting for what's best for the  country ?  Granted, if a candidate happened to be an unabashed Nazi proposing to legalize marriage between men and frogs and give heroin out to schoolchildren, but also offered a whopping tax refund to 35 year old musicians named Eric, I'll admit that it would make me think twice.  See what I mean??
