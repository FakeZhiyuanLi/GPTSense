      I'm looking at a Cadillac.  It's a '79.  I think it's black, I'm not sure, I'm sort of colorblind.  I do need a car.  I guess I know it's a bad idea.  But what do I know.  I know that's not a question.   Did I say I'm changing things?  I shouldn't have.  I should keep it to myself.  I see now how I used to get in so much trouble online.  It was the being online.  That & the drunk.  I

      I used to write poetry.  I made a book many years ago, I think it was called 99 Poems.  I know it was a number, I just think it was 99. I've started again, writing them.  I can't tell if it's different now.  It feels good, it feels right, but I can't remember how it felt before.  It's still not perfect. I built a skateboard out of parts from here & there.  Bad parts, but it saves a lot of steps on the way to the bus stop.   Speaking of stop, the concentration is gone.  It's nothing but crunching & grinding & talk of beheading.  No, I don't want to see the video.  I don't want to see ANY of them.   Something's got to change, & that's why I'm changing things.

      It's rubbery, I know. Orange looks good in you.  Just keep quiet & come over here.  Right here.  Sit down.  Now let the orange cone tell you its story.  Listen to the cone.  The traffic slows.  The danger lessens.  Nobody gets close to the cone anymore.  So the cone wanders.  Who can blame it?  If a cone can imitate life, then why wouldn't it?  Life can turn out like cones, cones can turn out like life.  This one is screwed like any human.  Rubber doesn't wear a rubber.  But when in life, do as the living do.  It's ugly on this street.  The potholes, the cracks, the abandoned cars; nobody takes it that seriously, the cone is selling itself short making any effort to be fair.   But now the cars are moving again.  Now the danger is back.  Now the cone must get back to work.

      I did this for years on my own web site.  S.s., d.d.. Bus station, phone, walk, FedEx, lunch, blog.  My day so far.  I found a mirror.  It's the small round convex one that sticks to the large flat truck mirror.  Still in one piece.  Makes a nice reflection.  Objects are closer than they appear.  I spent probably three hours total on the phone with FedEx tech support.  Most of the time I was doing the same things over & over.   I got a message.  I've got to go check something.  Boy, what a mess. Okay, I stand corrected & my baby has come out & given evidence that I exist.  There is no evidence of a correlation between us, but she wouldn't do that anyway.  It's the her show.  I am a bit player at best.  But enough about that.  I found out something neat about WordWeb.  Lunch is over, I've got to go.

      I'm feeling pretty absent today.  Vacated.  I stand for minutes at a time trying to follow one thought through to a sensible conclusion but not knowing what that conclusion is I don't know which direction to think.  This is my lunch break.  I almost never get through it anymore.  Hell, I almost never get one anymore.  I really need to ask for a raise.   A fresh can of Sprite (I obey my thirst) & a still-warm chicken quesadilla from Taco Bell & an air conditioner right over my head; this is the way to go.  All this running around out there in the heat & dust & whatnot is not my idea of the way to go.  But hey, I do what they tell me & ...  I've been expecting the pink slip for the little red Kawasaki I bought last year & I still haven't got it.  I don't know which of the likely hold-ups is responsible.  Did she forget?  Is she too cheap to spring for a stamp?  Did she lose it again?  Did the post office lose it?  Was she lying about finding it?  Maybe she lost my address.  Maybe I should call her again to make sure she has it.  It didn't sound like she was at home when I talked to her on the phone.  & I don't think she has my number.  Wait, her cell phone should have stored it when I called.  Speaking of cell phones... This morning I had to take the bus again, & for some reason it was full.  The first bus, that is: I have to take two to get here.  Anyway, I sat in the back, as I am wont to do, & was reading my library book, "Tu Cinco Sentidos," when the bus came to my first stop.  I got up & told the guy across from me that it was his stop also (I had heard him telling someone he was going to the hospital right there) & I walked down to my next stop.  I went to check what time it was when I realized that the thigh pocket of my Dickies shorts was empty.  I don't usually put my phone in there because it falls out so easily every time I sit down, but I wasn't thinking about it & I checked all the other pockets & sure enough, it was gone.  It is gone.  Somewhere between my house & the second bus stop it fell out of my pocket.  I tried calling it when I got to work, but nobody answers.  I'm hoping it went into some Foothill Transit lost-&-found, but I know the likelihood of that on a full bus is slim.  Hey, it's a free cell phone.  & a prepaid one at that with no kind of ownership or contract issue.  Just go to 7-Eleven & recharge it.  So I figure it's a goner, but I haven't given up entirely on the decency of humans.  There's a chance that the bus line has it, or that someone respectable picked it up, found the 'home' listing in my phone book, & called to leave me a message saying they've got it & I can come get it.  A ransom wouldn't be too bad, as long as it fits the situation.  I'm not paying over $50 to get back a $20 phone.  Its value is in the time it's still got on it, which is somewhere around 70 minutes.  So probably someone will use it up & discard it, maybe not realizing it's the Tracphone which is easy to steal.  Anyway, I'll keep calling it for a while & see what happens.   Well, my break's over.  Back to staring aimlessly at boxes for minutes at a time.  Hasta luego.        I can't believe this was almost 8 years ago.

      There's really only one person likely to read any of this.  Then again, with these automatic search things, you never know.  Here's something for you.       I have to go.  5

      We can't tell the truth, can we?  If everybody knew what we were really thinking we'd have trouble on our hands.  Blood on our hands.  I can't figure out how to put more pictures in here.  My lovely girlfriend has a blog here but you'd never know it.  She's not going to come out & admit I exist.  That would really screw up her options.  If everyone thinks you're available they'll offer you everything.   I'm just sure that, despite her one appearance with me, where there was no danger of interfering with her real life since it's just a bunch of losers I work with, those people have some idea that I might not be on the straight & narrow.  Not on the straight, anyway.  If I was open about my thoughts & feelings they would think I was a pig, & one with no standards at that.  But that's compared to theirs.  I know a couple of those guys at least that don't like the girls for who they are or where they come from or something, or maybe it's just that they're jealous or the girls are useless to them in a personal sense.  Whatever it may be it keeps me in check; I know better than to share my thoughts.  I shouldn't get too chummy with those guys anyway.        Hm, does that do anything?

      I'll get a camper.  I'll put on a motorcycle trailer.  I'll drive to Mexico.  I'll live & travel & learn & grow.  I'll write everything down.  & take pictures.  I'll make a book.  A movie.  A television series.  A revolution.  & maybe achieve my one true goal.   Fred's gone outside again.  I worry about him.

      When I get up in the morning I never know if I'm going to be picked up or if I have to walk a mile to a bus stop or if I'll end up walking all the way.  Ever since my bike got stolen my ability to maneuver around town & otherwise is extremely limited.  Mostly time-wise.  Speaking of time, I don't have it right now like I thought I might.  When the flies land, when the trucks stop, when the fat, self-serving bastard finally chokes on his own gluttony, I will breathe more slowly & not fear while blinking.  I wish I could make this last but the last one won't make five minutes so I'm not making last for anyone or anyone for last.  Diamonds cut clubs.   I don't know how I still haven't seen daylight come through.  I sent the boy away to do this man's job while I do nobody's job.  It's Friday.  I've had it.
