           Heh, I been trying so hard to find this song... It's one of my personal peberet!! It's LEMON TREE by Fool's Garden... this song's lyrics is so meaningful to me... it's about a guy who always been told by his gurlfren that they will be happy .... but never happen... his gurlfren talk about the blue sky but all he sees is only a lemon tree ( plain , sad , nothingness ) ... it's like my life...      Fool's Garden - LEMON TREE     Fool's Garden - Lemon Tree I'm Sitting Here In A Boring Room It's Just Another Rainy Sunday Afternoon I'm Wasting My Time I Got Nothing To Do I'm Hanging Around I'm Waiting For You But Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder  I'm Driving Around I n My Car I'm Driving Too Fast I'm Driving Too Far I'd Like To Change My Point Of View I Feel So Lonely I'm Waiting For You But Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder  I Wonder How I Wonder Why Yesterday You Told Me 'bout The Blue Blue Sky And All That I Can See Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree I'm Turning My Head Up And Down I'm Turning Turning Turning Turning Turning Around And All That I Can See Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree  I'm Sitting Here I Miss The Power I'd Like To Go Out Taking A Shower But There's A Heavy Cloud Inside My Head I Feel So Tired Put Myself Into Bed Where Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder  Isolation - Is Not Good For Me Isolation - I Don't Want To Sit On A Lemon-tree I'm Steppin' Around In A Desert Of Joy Baby Anyhow I'll Get Another Toy And Everything Will Happen - And You'll Wonder  I Wonder How I Wonder Why Yesterday You Told Me 'bout The Blue Blue Sky And All That I Can See Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree I'm Turning Around My Head Up And Down I'm Turning Turning Turning Turning Turning Around And All That I Can See Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree
