      I'm getting my hair cut today. For two weeks now I've been trying to decide what I want to do with my hair. My appointment is in 3 hours and I'm still not sure what I want to do with it. Actually I'm not sure I really want to cut it.  Yesterday I tried to get my husband to tell me not to cut it. When we were making love he kept wrapping my curls around his finger. I asked him if he was okay with me getting it cut and he said, "yeah." I asked him if he was going to miss my long hair. He said, "At least we won't have hair all over the place." Which I interpreted as, "at least there won't be hair in my soup anymore." I asked him if he was disappointed that I hadn't held out for longer hair. He said, "Whatever makes you happy." He was his loving, supportive self, but not one bit helpful.  A month ago I wanted to get it cut, but I talked myself out of it and changed the color instead. Which was a lot harder than I thought it would be. My normal hair color is dark brunette, although in the past I've had various shades red hair, burgundy hair, and when I was young I was blonde. Last month I decided to go blonde again. Why was this such a hard decision to make? I never thought I'd say it but I have become attached to my long hair (no pun intended). On daytime television they show women who have hair that is four or five feet long and when they cut it the women cry and carry on as if they have just lost their dog. I always thought they were weird. Until a year ago, when I was pregnant with my third child, I'd had short hair for 10 years and never had one problem with doing new things to it. Now though I'm scared of losing it. Maybe it's because I've worked so hard to grow it out. Maybe it's because I didn't realize until I'd grown it out that it was curly.  The truth is I'm scared of getting my hair cut. I'm scared of change and yet there is a part of me that is excited about something new and different. I would like to look my age. Older friends of mine say it's a good thing that people think I look younger than I am. But it's a big problem. Last night I was getting some alcohol and three different people at the store had to look at my I.D. to make sure I was old enough to buy it (I've been old enough for 6 years now).  I'm getting it cut today, even if I have to supress the screaming deep down inside of me. Stay tuned for a picture of the new me.
