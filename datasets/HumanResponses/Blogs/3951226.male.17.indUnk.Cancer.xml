      yeah so being totally honest just isnt workin for me.&nbsp; i used to lie all the time, really ALL THE TIME.&nbsp; and why wouldnt i, im so damned good at it, but then i realized that EVERYBODY lies, and that is sucks a big fat one, so i told myself id be totally honest.&nbsp; well, fuck it, ive went about a year like this, and i get stepped on all the time, i hate it.&nbsp; i got blamed for the first car accident even though the other guy ran a red light, lisa still lies to me (im sure), vicky is always acting retarded, i lost all my family, lisa's mom doesnt trust me for shit.&nbsp; i thought, if i always tell the truth, people will stop assuming im a liar like everyone else.&nbsp; that shit doesnt work, i tell the truth, i get shit on, my concious is no cleaner than it once was, but now i have all this bullshit for no reason.&nbsp; fuck it, maybe ill just start lying again.&nbsp;  grr.... I CANT DO IT!!!! i wish i could, i really do, but i HATE lying, i hate it, i hate it, i hate it.&nbsp; nobody has even lied to me today, im just still really angry that lisa's mom doesnt trust me.&nbsp; you would think the car accident (the one i caused) would make her not trust me, but no, you know what does it? lisa said this "yeah i think i like him" and ever since then im a hormone crazed, untrustworthy, nothing with a penis.&nbsp; in maria's eyes anyway.&nbsp; im not gonna start lying, i pray to God that lisa will stop lying to me, but i cant be like that anymroe, i cant lie to people who dont deserve it.&nbsp; beleive me, im still a good liar, but i feel bad afterwards, only because i expect&nbsp;honestly from other people.&nbsp;  alright, fuck&nbsp;it, i will not become a liar like i once was, but i&nbsp;will bring some of that asshole back.&nbsp; im so tired&nbsp;of being nice, its as effective as being honest, really.&nbsp; i can&nbsp;fabricate specific&nbsp;emotions in the average person, with&nbsp;certain actions. at one point in my life, not so long ago, i&nbsp;was a manipulative, lying,&nbsp;ASSHOLE.&nbsp; said whatever i wanted, whenever, didnt&nbsp;worry&nbsp;about&nbsp;offending anybody. im going to bring some of that&nbsp;back, not going to lie,&nbsp;lay off the manipulation, but i&nbsp;will be blunt, and&nbsp;anybody gets there feelings hurt FUCK IT, i dont care&nbsp;anymroe.&nbsp; nice guys suck, i know, im one&nbsp;of them.&nbsp;  all in all,&nbsp;the universe doesnt give breaks, atleast not to me,&nbsp;and im sick of it!!! (my dearest love is the&nbsp;only break ive gotten in years, shes a gift, really; and shes a pathelogical liar, it makes me sad really.)&nbsp;

      well...lisa has always told me multiple times before to start a diary.&nbsp; i never liked the idea, but now, ive got nothing better to do, so i might as well.&nbsp; yes...i have a website, but the server space is getting slim and the bandwidth limit sucks a lot so, i can use this just to type away whatever i want.&nbsp; i wonder if i can use pictures?&nbsp; i dont really care, im going to use this for my own personal use, i wonder if after a while ill notice how much i have changed, or if i change at all.&nbsp; oh itll be fun, i hope.&nbsp;  with the intent that nobody, cept maybe lisa or the doctor (in case i ever lose my mind), will read this i will use it to vent away my frustrations.&nbsp; well, to tell you the truth i only have one frustration.&nbsp; my mother in law is making it very difficult for me to see my wife (ok, ok, were only seventeen and the marriage isnt legal yet, or public for that matter) but i stll love lisa, with all my heart.&nbsp; we had a bit of an argument today, not really an argument seeing as how we werent arguing.&nbsp; problem is, i called her a liar, for like the fourth time ever, and it really hurt her feelings.&nbsp; but i didnt want to hurt her feelings, i just got mad cause SHE LIED TO ME.&nbsp; thus making her a liar.&nbsp; well, i put my foot in my mouth a few times, eventually leading to her crying, and my re-confessing my undying love for her.&nbsp; i come to learn that she doesnt even beleive i love her.&nbsp; she thinks im just talking out of my ass for no apparent reason, other than to entertain myself, and simply for the sake of lying.&nbsp; i wish she would just beleive me.&nbsp; ive never loved some one so much, and somehow i dont trust her any farther than i can throw her.&nbsp; ok, i dont distrust her that much, its just, i catch her lying so much, that i dont know when shes telling the truth anymore, i mean, if it ever came down to something important i dont even know if she loves me enough to do the right thing (i don tknow what im referring to here, but basically shes so hard to trust)&nbsp; I guess its partially my fault, seeing as how i dont trust anybody, but i try so ver yvery hard to trust her, and it just doesnt work when she lies about the stupidest things, geez, seriously, if she lies about the bullshit i dont care about, then is she even telling the truth when she says she wants to marry me.&nbsp; i firmly beleive she loves me, but can she really tolerate me for the rest of her life.&nbsp; i know ill never leave her, ill always love her, and im ready to get married now, but she says the same thing, i just dont beleive she means half of it.&nbsp; sure she loves me, eventually SHELL LEAVE ME, and i dont htink she really wants to marry me now.&nbsp; the only reason i think this is that she says these little things like "i dont know why i love you" and "i missed my cat more than i missed you" OH THAT PISSED ME OFF.&nbsp; honestly, love me for the sake of loving, but dont question yourself, if you question yourself about love, then it isnt really true.&nbsp; ugh!!!&nbsp; i guess i beleive a little too much in the subconcious, in my brain i dont doubt what i beleive to be true, i dont doubt tha ti love lisa, i dont doubt that i want to marry her, i dont doubt that i want to see her, and waiting for anything more than it takes to think about it means that you dont really want it, thats what i beleive. whew, this sure was a lot, see, i couldnt put this all on my site, but i need to get it off my chest, i love her so much, but she lies to me all the time, and for some reason doesnt beleive that i love her.&nbsp; she thinks i lie, even though ive never lied to her, while at the same time gets offended when i call her a liar even though she has lied to me, told me she LIES to me, told me she wont stop, and will probably continue lying to me.&nbsp; how could i love someone so amazingly difficult?&nbsp; well, it doesnt really matter, i love her no matter what, i fell in love with her instantly, i beleive our souls belong together and everything on the outside is just extra....to deal with, or indulge in.&nbsp;  alright, all in all, very frustrated, yet madly in love.&nbsp;

      its been a while, havent felt the need to vent recently, but i thought i should put down how things are going. My darling has gotten all better, apologized for what she had done. Turns out, her life is remarkbly similar to mine, the sad part about that is that she had no idea. she had hte idea that her life was so much more complicated, that she had been through hell, and i was walking on sunshine. Well i kinda broke down in front of her, first i yelled at her, then i told her all the shit i been through, then almsot started crying, then she cryed, then she apologized, i slowly whispered "youre not the only one" we sat together for awhile, weve been great ever since. i asked why she treated me the way she did, she said "thats the way ive been treated and thats just what i think is the norm" then i told her "its not the norm, you know how much it hurts, why hurt me, have i ever hurt you" A while later, we were done, and like i said, all better. shes treats me better now. that day may have helped, but it wouldnt have been any different if it wasnt for her new medication. not sure what it is, she doesnt know, but its working. shes never felt happier, and i hope i make her feel happy too, so im sure shes feeling better than ever and im really glad. so shes happy, she treats me good now, im happy (like i used to be) and were doing great!!! i always loved her, and i knew we'd get through it, now that we're good im thrilled.  oh, and we started school today, seniors.  im excited, shes afraid.  i think shes sad about graduation, she wants her dad to be there.  she doesnt share with me the way she used to, i think it bothers her more that ive gone through the same shit, but handle it better.  i want my mom at graduation, oh so much, but i cant do anything about it, so im going to be happy for the people who CAN show up.  be happy with what you have, not sad with what you had.  simple as that, i mourn, but theres a point when you need to stop dwelling, everyone dies, much as it hurts  WHATEVER...point is, shes afraid, not only cause of that, but doesnt think she can handle being a senior, shes afraid she wont be able to survive in the real world.  she failed one class, and got a c in chemistry.  she's not as smart as she used to be, im sure, (when i didnt know her i mean)  cause she says she never studied, and she always did good, shes having trouble coping with the fact that shes going to have to try harder now to get the same results as before.  i promised to help her with her school work, i hope she comes to me, i hope she tries.  bad habit of quiting before she begins.  also afraid of failure.  all and all, it sounds like shes got problems but she doesnt.  shes just afraid of dissapointment, thats it, however, tht spans into other things, and thats why she gets mad at herself.  its ok though, she is really smart, smarter then the average seventeen year old, and im sure when the time comes shell be able to handle herself alright.
