      I am utterly disgusted at this supposed Summer. The forecast for last weekend was really good, but it was just that horrible misty rain that hangs in the air and makes it ridiculously hard to dry the 500 tonnes of clothes you have to wash. I did attempt to battle the misty rain. Shockingly enough it was futile. It conspired with low pressure to give me really bad sinus pain AND get me wet, even though no rain appeared to be falling at the time. Grrr!

      Gah! My mother is clearly preparing for my move to another country. She rang me late last night when I was asleep to ask me a series of questions she could have asked me in the morning. When I previously lived in Germany she used to call between 2 and 3am, as she claimed it was the only time I was in, which led to her being convinced I was dead when I was out a couple of nights in a row (there was no answering machine). I can see her now, when I move to New York, before she goes to work she'll ring me, just to be sure to get me in the middle of the night.  And (is this a feature of all mothers?) there's always the implication that its MY fault that she has to ring me up in the middle of the night to ask me something mundane.  hmm this give me an idea, what if I ring CTP up at all sorts of hours, maybe he wouldn't want me as a mother anymore and would stop annoying me. I wouldn't even have to plan it. I could just ring him up after my mother calls me.  Hmmmm... beard stroking...

      Ahh despite not being hungover I'm still hoping this day will end quickly. Its lunchtime on Friday Hooray. OK I'm working tomorrow, but still. Less than two weeks left in this place. Double Hooray!  Any of you propaganda press contributors out there be sure to work on your submissions at the weekend because the deadline is next Wednesday and my hired goons need the work before I go to Amerikay and leave them unemployed so they will be quite happy to do overtime in order to help me finish the paper on time. Phew that was a long sentence. Note the complete lack of punctuation too... see I'm not on editing duty so I can flaunt the rules of English grammar... I also flaunt the rules of taste and decency, but that's usually whilst editing the paper

      Ah yes last night was a work night out and I did NOT get hammered (for once). So my mind is as clear as a crystal clear thing this morning. And I get to laugh at everyone else pretending not to have hangovers this morning. Oh the humanity!

      well kids I'm very busy at the moment preparing for the Propaganda Press to go global and the fact that our publishing office is moving to New York. To say nothing of the confounded maternity suit that that git CTP keeps going on about. I am not his mother...  have never had any relations, sexual or otherwise, with his father Caddicus Rasputin Powers, except for the fact that he worships me as the vast media giant he will never be.  Have work to do kids... Dictatorships don't run themselve you know. Turn your back for a minute and you've got a democracy on your hands. Tsk

      well I've had a great time since my last post. Had my medical which was all grand. Went to Tullamore. The party on Friday was great fun. So many people showed up and I got great presents. I think I should have faked leaving the country long ago in order to get such great presents and then refuse to give them back of course!! I didn't get too tearful on Friday and held my composure til that Kate bitch started crying - damn her! got home around after 4am due to complete lack of taxis. Also Jack, I never got to say goodbye to you as you ran away to drink in the gaiety before I saw you!!  On saturday I went out to dinner with Aoife, Sand and Gav and got more great presents, I sound so materialistic - dinner was lovely too.  Then we went back home to eat icecream and play Simpsons cluedo, which I shockingly lost. For most of yeaterday I had a family day. Dinner with the parents and John and Uta and another game of simpsons cluedo, which I lost again. I think the game is jinxed. Also went to see King Arthur last night. Not able to get the Monty Python version out of my head. I think Clive Owen was miscast as Arthur, but the film had some redeeming features that make it not as bad as the reviews made out. I particularly liked the fight on ice. Different from the usual battle scenes. And I did especially appreciate the performance of the aptly named Sir Notappearinginthisfilm. Anyway the last few days have been mainly ones of goodbyes, which is, of course, sad, but I know I'll get to see everyone at Christmas which isn't too far away.  Also last night it pissed rain, which was a nice reminder of the wonderful weather I will be missing... bring on the snow!  I'm heading off tomorrow and I don't imagine I'll make a post before I get to Binghamton. So the next post will be Wednesday at the earliest I'd say. I've still a few people to see this evening, but everyone take care and stay in touch (everyone, but Caddy Powers Jr, of course!)

      Gah! I didn't think that post about my visa had gone up at all. Stupid internet cafe computers. Anyway since last Friday I've had my leaving drinks from work and moved all my stuff from my flat to my parents house. I still have no idea how I accumulated all this crap and yet it all seems to precious to throw out. I have been as ruthless as I can be and have not divested myself of at least six black sacks of stuff and it still doesn't all fit in my bedroom!  I've also had contact with my new family from the University's family friendship programme. OK they're not really my new family, but it's helpful to annoy my actual family with this. Anyway they seem lovely. Today I have been attempting to start packing, in an effort to see if everything I propose to bring will fit in the suitcase. It hasn't been toobad really, but I know I haven't remembered everything  Tomorrow I plan to have my medical and then go to Tullamore to see my friend Louise and her daughter Sibeal. I'll be back on Friday in plenty of time for the party.   In relation to Friday I have decided that its m party and I'll bling if I want to! Also there may be crying... 'll be emotional, there'll be alcohol... its bound to happen.  See you all then!

      Well my visa is all sorted now. I had a fairly hectic morning trying to get to the embassy. The visa requires you to have a pre-paid swiftpost envelope and despite trying to get one at two different locations yesterday - one of them being the GPO - I had to wait until the post office round the corner from me opened at 9 this morning to get one before getting to the embassy at 9.50. Of course the PO didn't bother to open until after 9 and then didn't have any left and suggested I go to the next nearest post office in Harolds Cross - so I ran until I got there - and as I'm sure you're aware its really really humid in Dublin at the moment. Anyway I finally got an envelope at there and then had to flag down a taxi - which seemed to take for ever. So by the time I got to the embassy I had sweat out all the fluids in my body!! What a lovely image.  Everyone at the embassy was lovely and it all went grand from there - was home by 12. So glad that's over.  I also finished work yesterday and everyone was so lovely and I got lovely gifts. We're having drinks tonight because a leprosy sufferer is finishing today also.  I must go and get food now.

      Well I spent a lovely long weekend in Northern Ireland with my friends. It was really relaxed and chilled, which is what I really need at the moment; everything else is so hectic. It was great to sit around, watch tv and chat. I also may have forced everyone to watch Dog Soldiers. so that was great - obviously!  Now I'm back in work for my last week - well actually three days. I have loads to do before finished here. Today has been crazy. Even more crazied up by the fact that there is no one to replace me and so I can't start my work transfer/training in.  My visa interview is on Friday so hopefully that will all go well or else this might not be my last week at work!  Also for all you PP readers out there, everything is so hectic this week I think it might be the end of the week before the August edition is published

      Okay, now the main reason (besides alcohol) for starting the blog was as an easy way for people to follow my exploits once I bugger off to Glasgow at the end of the Summer.  However my little Glasgow Odyssey has already started long before September since I have to get prepared and all that.  Here is what I learned about Glasgow so far:  1:\ There is a conspiracy to prevent Irish people from finding anything in Glasgow - as there appears to be some sort of blacklist against selling maps of Glasgow. At one point after asking at the counter for one, I was asked would a map of Edinburgh do instead. Aggghhh. How silly of me, I had obviously forgotten that all Scottish cities were identical and therefore all I needed was a map of a completely different Scottish city instead. It's like going to Limerick and getting a map of Dublin (instead of the body armor you need to protect yourself).  2:\ I will be living in the "West End" of Glasgow. It appears to be a "Temple Bar / Ranalagh five to ten years ago" type of environment. Loads of 2nd hand bookstores, lots of restaurants and pubs and 3 colleges all within. This probably means that everyone I meet in there will probably be just like me (well not as handsome obviously). Go middle class snobs!  3:\ Living among middle class slobs may be a good thing as I can't understand the Scottish accident. Screw it, I can't even make out what some Scots write. I was on a discussion board (re: Glasgow's interesting locations) and many wrote phonetically. Couldn't understand a word. It took me five minutes to work out "Ah" was "I". I'm screwed.  4:\ Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds will be playing there in November. And I have tickets. Wooooooo.  5:\ Glasgow has the highest living standards in the UK but the lowest health levels. The culture of deep frying Mars bars could possibly be to blame ...  6:\ I am going to the city with the 2nd largest amount of shops in the UK (after London) but will have no money. Man, how cruel.  7:\ Calling some Scots "British", can lead to diplomatic problems. Who knew?  8:\ The first thing the vast majority of people say once they here I am going to be living there is "Cool, now I have a place to stay when Celtic play."  9:\ The 3rd most common is "Don't wear Green in Govan or near Ranger areas.  10:\ The 2nd most common is "Don't go to Govan". But why, didn't the fine street bard Rab C Nesbit hail from there. Oh, I see ...

      Okay now somebody is taking the piss.  According to  urlLink Joe Conason  over in Salon (sorry you need to sit through one of their internet ads in order to be allowed to read - natch); two groups who support Bush (Citizens for a Sound Economy and Oregon Family Council) have been actively aiding Ralph Nader to be put on the ballot in Oregon in order to take wind out of John Kerry's bid there.  Yes, that's right, we have not only "Democrats for Bush" but also Republicans for Nader (well at least until just before November).  Further proof how out of the times I am since I believe that Republicans for Kerry is the only way to go (see earlier post).

      It seem that the right wing punditry (as well as the mainstream press) in the states seem to be parroting back the Bush-line that the White House staff never actually said there was a link between Al-Qaeda and Sadam.   urlLink Alternet  and  urlLink Ted Rall  have good articles on this  The strongest memory I have of the Bush tactic of imply but don't say directly was the  urlLink 2003 State of the Union  address:   "Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans -- this time armed by Saddam Hussein. It would take one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known. We will do everything in our power to make sure that that day never comes. (Applause.)"   Of course this does not say that Saddam was involved in Sept. 11th but it is quite clear what Bush wanted people to think and more importantly to feel about Saddam. In combination with Bush's entire cabinet appearing week in and week out saying equally charged statements, it is not surprising that by the time of the Iraq invasion over two thirds of Americans polled believed that Saddam had been proven to be involved in Sept. 11th.   The reason the 2003 State of the Union sticks in mind is that the next morning I was having a discussion with an American over it and he said that although not a Bush supporter that hw was quite impressed by the level of intelligence information that Bush had given. I replied, that from books, articles etc on the subject that I had read, some of the intelligence sounded out of date and/or misleading and in one or two places just sounded plain wrong.  Back in 2003 this was not the most easy stance to take. How times change ...

      Checking out "Aint It Cool News" when I came across  urlLink this .  Seems to be some sort of weird ass stop motion film in which two WW2 robots who think that they are human and we [humanity] are the robots (voiced by Jack Black and John C Reilly) go after Hitler. Of course Hitler killing himself causes problems and the two Automatons are sent to the bottom of the sea.  Cut to present day and Hitler (voiced by John Cleese) and Mussolini (voiced by The Italian stallion himself Sly Stalone) are back. Only they have repented and want to put on a version of You're a good man Charlie Brown. Guess it's time for the Automatons to come out of retirement.   I have a feeling this film is too good to be true (Stalone as Mussolini is the best casting since Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis got the parts of Elvis and JFK). Even if it true, despite the voices being in the can, probably is years away. Sigh

      As my close friends will tell you, I have more then a soft spot when it comes to the work of the greatest comedian who ever lived. Bill Hicks to the uninformed.  I was going through Amazon and suddenly was curious to check if there was another Bill Hicks biography released recently (Louieman had told me there had been but I think he may have been referring to the Cynthia True book).  Anyway I saw a CD, "The Perfect Gig". I didn't have that one,  urlLink so I got the details up . It was a music CD. Oh joy, I thought, it must be Bill performing his music. Perhaps it is the Marblehead Johnson CD only repackaged and named.  Then I saw the From the Artist column and he described how the gig went in 2001. Err but Bill was in his cold cold grave by then.  Turns out there is another Bill Hicks out there. He has been releasing music for years now. From reading some of his comments he seems nice enough but ....  He is evil, evil I tell you. The album sells because many stupid Bill Hicks fans (wow I never thought I would say that) just block buy a load off CDs of Amazon without checking into them first. Okay so he's not evil but I thought the attention grabbing post may prevent people from foolishly buying this by mistake. Unless of course you think you like the sound of the senior Bill, in which case buy away.

      Goddamn marketing,  I am sick and tired of that stupid Dennys add that uses Joyce. It's like those gits who use editing + CG to use dead celebrities to hock their wares.  I plan to go back in time and convince Joyce to make every character in Ulysses a vegetarian just to fuck with the company.  Plan is somewhat dependent on a major breakthrough in time travel though. Hmmm, perhaps I should just dress up as Joyce's ghost and try to scare the advertisers into repenting.  Maybe I shouldn't have watched Scooby Doo as a child.

      Found  urlLink this site  on the internet this morning. It seems to be run by someone who is a Kerry supporter but claims that this did not bias his results. It is a breakdown, state by state of the electoral college vote in USA as shown by opinion polls.  Hmmm, Kerry seems to have a clear margin but that is dependent upon quite a number of swing states which are "barely Kerry".  Also there is an excel spreadsheet on the site that allows you to see what would happen if certain states change sides. Haven't had too much time to look at it so I'm not sure yet how accurate it is but my initial scan picked up no major flaws.  Fun for a rainy days afternoon (if you are a very boring person like me).

      Maybe I'm becoming paranoid, but I am having more and more doubts concerning my wife. I suspect she is having an affair with a member of some Rock and/or Roll band. My first clue was the following thing she said when leaving the other day:  Elaineman: See you Caddy, I'm off to see my hot new boyfriend. He's in a band you know.  Apparently he is the girly one from some band "JJ7Can't be bothered remembering the rest of the name". This is quite an achievement as the band apparently even has a female member.  Damn it, why couldn't she date Lemmy from Motherhead. I always wanted to die whilst fighting over a women with Lemmy.  Darn it.  P.S. Actually the dream was to die fighting over a ho with Lemmy, but I didn't really want to face the small ball of fire that is Elaineman by saying that.

      Wow, according to the  urlLink NY Times  (you need to register to read this, but hey the price tag is $0.00) it seems like old Ralph Nader is picking Peter Miguel Camejo, a member of the green party, as his number two.  He even says he would accept running under the Green banner.  Of course as the article points out, the greens are divided on Nader (those who like him because they think he is the best candidate for their cause Vs those who don't want to endorse him because they think Bush is the worst candidate for their cause). Still, currently, it seems like the Greens are standing by their decision not to back Nader this time round and I see little reason why this should change.  Have to say I'm glad of this as I would have to be on the "lets all vote for John [Please think of me as JFK] Kerry just to get rid of Georgie" team. And that is something Nader could influence, at least according to those at  urlLink Don't Vote Ralph  (and with a name like that, they can't be biased - can they?).  UPDATE Okay, okay so I know that I'm taking this publicity stunt a bit too seriously. The green party already has a Pres candidate, David Cobb.  Also Ralph does have the Populist Party, which seems to be a party of one man though.  Apparently it is still a very contentious issue amongst many of the Greens in the US of A that Cobb isn't taking a more Nader like approach.

      Thought I'd end the night by trying to set up a counter movement for Zell Miller's "Democrats for Bush".  All Republicans I implore you for your own good to vote Kerry come November (or at the very least stay home and don't vote at all).  Why would you do that to your beloved Pres?  If Bush wins in 2004, then who will stop Hillary Clinton in 2008? Are you really that sure you can pull someone out of your hat to take out a Clinton?  Personally I never cared much for the Clintons and therefore would rather Kerry wins this time round and therefore preventing Hillary running till at least 2012, and hopefully by than the Dems will have found someone else

      I was going to put this in as an update to the previous post but I just thought I'd transcibe this short article from the Eye (1103) in full. I had intended to find an online source for this but I got sick of reading about terrorists and particularly of looking up sites that seem to lack any kind of rational judgement on the issue (from both sides of the spectrum).   US President George Bush is attracting support from unusual quarters in his bid to beat John Kerry to the White House this autumn.  Joinging the neo-con chorus rooting for Dubya is none other than the Abu Hafs al Masri Brigade, one of the shadowy groups that claims responsibility for the Madrid bombings.  "It is not possible to find a leader more foolish than you [Bush], who deals with matters by force rather then with wisdom," said a statement sent by the group to a London-based Arabic newspaper. "Kerry will kill our nation while it sleeps because he and the Democrats have the cunning to embellish blasphemy and present it to the Arab and Muslim nation as civilization ... Because of this we desire you [Bush] to be elected"   Pity the Eye didn't say the name of the Arabic paper so I could check into it (not really sure how I would check it if it is in Arabic though).  As I said using such a quote in an argument would normally be too low for me, but hey they started it.

      This is an old one but I think kind of funny (not funny ha ha, but funny a in weird / sick).  Seems that right wing pundits in America think that  urlLink Al Qaeda loves the democrats . Okay. Hmmm. Yes those wacky fundamentalists would really love the secular, pro-feminism etc etc party (well they are compared to the current Neo-Con Republicans).  It reminds me of the  urlLink Tom Tomorrow cartoon  in which he has a debate by those wondering how they should vote if were to be another terrorist attack in the USA. Or if none occur. However in my mind, if their is another terrorist attack in America then Bush is guarantee to win and most likely by a landslide (unless it is categorically his fault and the media have a video tape showing he is the cause - in which case Bush is not guaranteed to win but probably still will thanks to stupid opponent, complacent media and stuffed election boxes)   But in fact didn't the people responsible for the Spanish train bombing (which the American right wing media claimed caused the "surrender" of Spain at the election held a few days after) release an open letter in some London Islamic publication claiming that they viewed John Kerry as the great threat to their cause because he would cause the Islamic nations to be destroyed as they slumber while on the other hand they felt George W. was the greatest thing since sliced bread since he was giving them their Holy War. Unfortunately I am in "work" now so I can't pull out my backlog of Private Eye (Where I think I read about it). I'll see if I can find a link online to confirm this stories existence.  Of course it doesn't really make a difference as it could all be bullshit or even reverse psychology (I have to throw Ann Coulter a bone every so often - innuendo unintended) but ultimately come November Americans should make their vote up depending on which leader they think is the right one and not on what they perceive the terrorists want.  However some biased pundit saying "hey terrorists want Kerry to win because errr because Bush could beat Saddam" etc is pathetic.  P.S. Just quickly re-read my post and must say that it feels odd describing anyone as thinking that John "Hey I have the same initials as Jack Kennedy" Kerry as a threat.

      Weird thing happened,  My old Vice-Principal rang me yesterday. Haven't spoken to him since leaving school all those years ago. In fact it could well have been many years before that when I spoke my last words to him. Lack of trouble and sporting interest kept us on different paths.  Anyway he rings me and says his team is short cricket players and could I help. This is odd as I have never even watched a game of cricket let alone played one. Actually that isn't true, once I sort of looked at a cricket game in order to get to the cricket club's bar but I swear I didn't pay attention.  Therefore I had to decline, when he asked was I sure that I couldn't play the game since he had a distinct memory of me playing on the team back in school. "Maybe you should try Jimmyman" I said "he plays" I offered wondering had he confused me with the poor bastard who had to deal with me for a friend me during our six years in secondary education. "I know that" he sort of sounded like he thought I was speaking down to him "are you really sure you've never played?". "Positive, I don't even know how". In fact I don't even really remember what a criketball looks like but I didn't mention that at the time.  So ended our conversation. Weird. Boring, yes - but still weird.

      Damn, so I got drunk and was tricked by a friend into starting a blog.  I then got even more drunk and wrote in load of posts to make it appear that I am prolific. Screw it I don't even know what prolific means. Or if I'm spelling it right.  Besides since I set it up that no-one should notice me until I want them to, it does -with hindsight - seem foolish that I spent last night writing everything that came to mind.  Ah well some things have annoyed me today even if I am only up. Might as well keep blogging.

      An open letter to  urlLink The Skate Pope   Come on dude, you’re such a hypocrite. Jesus was obviously a BMXer (your mortal enemy as a skater). Let’s face it, look at the greatest Jesus movie ever made “ET: The Extraterrestrial”. It taught us that He, who came to this world with a message of peace, died and was reborn again, automatically sided with BMXheads over skateboarders. Pity that Jesus was horribly disfigured by the time of that movie (and seemed to have a Moses sized Speech impediment).  Either become a BMXer or lose the title of Pope.

Please people in the Republic of Ireland, let's do all we can to prevent Irish unification.  Why you ask?  As my best friend Nugeman would say "It may sound good in principle, but seriously do you want Ian Paisley TD"  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooo!

      If I ruled the world, and we all pray that someday I shall, the first thing I would do is force you all to worship Natalie Portman as your God-Queen. The second would be to (shock Gasp Horror he’s a leftie) to nationalise one or two key areas that are of absolute importance to the state. Surprising on my list would be lawyers. Yes that’s right lawyers.  So why is it of supreme importance to get rid of free market principles in law. Well to me equality under the law is fundamentally important in a democracy. Without it, democracies are doomed to corrupt. If an individual can finance a case beyond that of the state (imagine something on the lines of OJ, or Ken Lay if the fucker ever went to trial - the bastard) then he is above the law. If on the other hand the state or any other defendant is able to outspend an individual then that to is a violation of equality under the law.  Now this isn’t just another I hate rich people speech (although I do hate rich people, and poor people for that matter and even well off people – fuck it I hate everyone), because I know people of my own means (not rich but above average on the wealth scale) who did it. When I say “means” I of course mean Family means. In essence the daddies solicitor. I remember my eighteenth year on this worthless rock of a planet and some of my friends who knew better got themselves into trouble over a very stupid but still illegal affair. No one was hurt or robbed but it was still chargeable. Had they gone in without good solicitors / lawyers then there was a good chance they would have gotten a record and would have gotten at least one fired and screwed another’s college chances abroad.  The case never reached the court. Quashed / settled out of court because of who they know. I’m not actually sure of the exact details (I don’t speak lawyer) but it was all legal and all of it done without any mention of arrest going on a record that could effect business or college career. And these people, trust me, are not on the upper tier of society. But that’s how it works but not for those on the other side of the average income line.  Yes I know this nationalisation of law would cause problems in backlogs etc (I’m an idea man only) and I accept that. But screw it; democracy as far as I am concerned is doomed without doing without it.  Besides can you imagine the Tribunals in Ireland if all the Lawyers involved were being paid a flat rate each day? “Sir I suggest a lengthy investigation at the tax payer’s expense with myself getting at least sixteen weeks holiday a year. This case could go on years ….. What do you mean I get paid exactly the same per day regardless of what case I am on and I have set holidays … Screw it on second thoughts all the politicians are obviously guilty.” Perfect.

      Now that I think about it (and by think I mean steal an idea from Aunty Helpful Dictator – one of my fathers enemies who I suspect is my mother) isn’t Mark Sloane always guilty of entrapment in essentially every episode of Diagnosis murder. It must be brilliant for those criminals. “Damn, I was on the verge of being tracked down by forensic evidence and the eventual witness who comes forward but fortunately some old cook doctor picked on some sentence I misspoke and figured out I was the killer but lacking proof force me into revealing myself with an elaborate hoax. If it wasn’t for that I would have gone to jail for sure”.   Damn you Mark “Dick Van Usurping Bastard” Sloane

      Everyone has one. Even Celibates. It’s the music that comes to your ears every time you think of sex (or are in the middle of the process). Mine is the theme to the Magic Roundabout. Then again the Murder She Wrote music comes up quite often to (but I think that’s because I am thinking of Jessica).

      I think I am once again going to try to watch the last episode of the Prisoner. I love it, but boy howdy I still don’t think I fully have it.  It’s a challenge. Ladies, imagine an eight foot cock and you’ll get the amount of drugs I would be required to do in order to fully get myself around this doozie of an episode. Unfortunately bar the black stuff, I am a tee-totaler. Bloody parents instilling me with a fear of drugs, I’ll have to kick them the next time I’m over (or at least when I eventually figure out who my mother is).

      Damn I failed, I tried to resist my manly nature of creating what I think would be my all time super band ….  Drums: Keith Moon. Like I need a reason. Guitars: Joey Santiago and Pete Townsend. Neither are the best guitarists of all time but I am of the opinion that you need people who can function within a ban structure thereby ruling out Hendrix and his ilk. Bass Guitar: Kim Deal. I just love chicks on bass Violins: John Cale and Warren Ellis. I have an odd fondness for violins within bands. Weird I know but these two guys can rock with the best of them on those babies. Piano/Keyboard/Organ: Hmmm not sure about this one. My heart says Dr John, but I don’t think he fits the band dynamic. Oddly I think I need John Cale here. Making him the rare position that he has to be cloned for the ultimate band. That’s the problem when you’re so damn talented. Vocals: P.J. Harvey. Voice just sends a shiver down my spine.  Writing Credits: All good bands need great music: Lou Reed and Nick Cave shall do nicely for me. Of course neither working together at the same time as they will just explode.

      As those who know me well, I always had a soft spot for Jessica Fletcher. I also have grown a worrying hatred for Dick Van Dyke since “Diagnosis Murder” often replaces our Jess (you usurping Bastard). However I have grown very worried by the number of people who believe that she is somehow evil. The theory goes that Jessica Fletcher is a psycho-killing granny (which goes to show how little they know since she and her late husband Frank had no Grandchildren) who kills around the country (and occasionally in England and even more rarer in some other exotic country like Ireland in that quality TV movie that was great and portrayed us Irish in a really non-stereotypical way) and then frames others for her crimes. Allow me to dispel the rumour.  In fact Jessica Fletcher goes around the country finding murders and framing whoever the first poor sod she can make confess, sending innocent men, women and vulcans (in the lesser known Murder She Wrote – Star Trek cross over) to jail and presumably in some states to the death sentence also allowing murdering psychos to go free. All this in order to gain publicity to sell her shitty sub par Agatha Christie novels.  So you see, Jessica Fletcher is not evil. And is very sexy. There I said it.

      Finishing off the last of my lucozade supplies today before permanently giving up. This is my last source of caffeinated “goodness” and in the end I can’t say I’m too sorry to see it go. Why is it going? Well GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) are evil. This wasn’t exactly a revelation to me either, but it’s just getting hard to ignore the facts. According to the Eye (No 1108) GSK is being sued in America for prescribing children anti-depressants it knew was dangerous. What a bunch of Bastards.  The only problem is that due to my extremely sensitive taste buds, I am only left now drinking Water or Guinness (or maybe Cobra is in an Indian restaurant). I am beginning to worry about my need for the black stuff to now finish any assignment (including writing this very post).  Well now you’ve learned some useless fact about me and a somewhat less useless fact about GSK and it’s stuck in your brain forever now. Bwahhahaha.

      If this is the first post you are reading here I advise to start somewhere else as I am not my chirpy self by the end of this piece. I am coming to the terms with the fact that I am lame. That I am no longer (and in all likelihood never was) cool was a pain. However discovering I have crossed over into actually being lame sucked.  I don’t know when it first happened but it came crystal clear to me Saturday a week ago when watching the Pixies play in Phoenix Park.  The day started slowly. Group of friends and yours truly made our way by bus (how I hate buses – I’ll probably bitch about it later). Eventually I and my best friend, the all and powerful Nugeman, were separated because we had the ability to walk faster then a snail. Got to the gig at the end of Groove Armada (Shake Your Ass of the Stage Assholes). Sat on the grass and listened to the average “The Thrills”. They were all right but I was a tad bored as the Nugeman was in a mellow mood and seemed to want to lay in the sun which I hate (I’ll bitch about that later too). Eventually the Pixies seemed ready to loom. Nugeman led me through the crowd to get a half decent spot. I would have been happy about twice the distance away but to Nugeman’s credit he was adapt at slipping by crowds. So there I stood in a good spot. Probably one of the best spots outside of moshland. Pixies came on and I suddenly felt very self-conscious and sober. I couldn’t sing along with bone machine (1st song) and didn’t even jump up and down. 2nd song. Made an effort to be bouncy and jump around a lot. Landed on some poor tarts feet. I’m heavy (damn you Guinness and my own unhealthy lifestyle) so I have to feel sorry for her. Stopped jumping just as Nugeman jumped forward into those who were partying ahead of us. Bar a fleeting glance of him a few songs later, I was alone.  A great gig was in front of me but I felt very awkward. My arms were trapped by those around me and the guy in front’s head kept bobbing in such a way that it permanently became a threat to breaking my nose. Suddenly the crowd beside me tried some serious moshing. I saw girls running from the carnage crying (or laughing, the female mind is so hard to read), and suddenly I had been propped as the shield to separate norms from moshers.  Near me was this forty odd year old. Now I don't mean forty year old as in age; although he was in his forties. I mean forty year old in mind. 40 as in those very lame people who only seem capable of discussing about schools in their area / rise in crime [I know it is amazing I could tell this by a glance, but hey I'm that observant]. Yet strangely as we were hit and pushed by a crowd of underage morons and junkies who I had mistaken for gays (hey the heroin chic they had looked kinda camp till the violent behaviour) I grew a self deluded bond with the bastard. Two last normals in a sea of idiots. It was then I realise I was like one of the parents who had been roped into brining little Johnny and his delinquent friends to the concert and realise he hated everyone there. I was suddenly as lame as a parent of a fourteen year old. Bollocks.  My paranoia increased. By the time of Vamos (my least favourite Pixies song of all time) I was on the verge of being convinced that I was surrounded by Shawn of the Dead like zombies. Claustrophobia hit and I struggled to get out of the crowd.  Listen to the rest of the gig from the back behind the crowd plus left at the very moment Pixies stopped playing. Walking back depressed on a Sunny Evening I was suddenly shouted at by a complete stranger “Hey Mr sunglasses [What he called me due to my need to wear glasses to prevent hay fever] wear a smile”. No you fuck I won’t, I’m suddenly lame and been yelled at by idiot strangers who suddenly feel morally superior to me.

      Wow, this is of course one of those unfortunate coincidence things, right?  Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani [terrorist] arrest is announced just before Kerry's speech. It's weird, of course, because  The New Republic  actually said it would happen weeks ago. It seems that for some reason, the Bush side of the force had asked for  urlLink extra vigilance  in policing [and reporting of the policing] of HVT [High Valued Targets] for the start of the democratic nominations. Hmmm, almost makes you believe in the theory that Bin Ladin is being kept on ice for November. Almost ...  What strikes me though is that [if we assume that the Bush admin did set this up] no-one in the White House really seems to think that anyone in America is capable of remembering reports from a couple of weeks before [or capable of reading them, we probably should assume]. However so far I don't think any of the major networks have commented on this surprising twist [leaving it to the internet moaners to bring it up] so maybe they have a point.

       urlLink Andrew Sullivan , for those not in the know, is a prominent Right-Wing pundit - a right hate peddler in the Clinton days apparently but has, in fairness, being quite balanced since GWB took over. At least balance in comparison to the rest of the increasingly partisan political commentary&nbsp;in America.&nbsp;   However as a Log-Cabin Republican [Gay Republican],&nbsp;Sullivan has been left in a bit of a weird place. Does he support Bush [and therefore the main protagonist in removing his rights currently] or go with Kerry [and -ye gads- be forced to vote Democrat]? Due to&nbsp;the fact that Kerry will have two Republican houses to deal with, Sullivan makes the -probably valid- point that Kerry may end up being fiscally more conservative then Bush; who spends like there is no tomorrow [although that could be because he knows something we don't know]. So that is another point against the big Dubya. Only defense seems to keep Sullivan hanging around [God only knows why as I would have thought that was Bushes weakest point].   Anyway the reason I mention this is that Sullivan's site now has a little Donkey [I pretty sure it wasn't there before]&nbsp;peering out over the logo for the Daily Dish. Has Bush lost a fairly prominent pundit or is Sullivan just trying to annoy the number of conservative writers who have chided him recently for expressing doubts on Bush? Interesting ... or maybe not. Anyway I thought it rather fascinating so now it is stuck in your brain.    Oh well, two posts regarding homosexuality in a row ... I better quit now before that Catholic Church comes after me&nbsp;

      Okay so by now I'm assuming everyone knows the publicity grabbing news that the Simpsons is going to out a character in January. Of course this is just an attempt to get foolish people to start arguing on who it will be and I shouldn't really join in ... but ... what the heck.   The most obvious choice is Smithers (but perhaps a tad too obvious) probably followed by Patti or Principal Skinner. However I for one think Groundskeeper Willie would be an amusing choice - either that or Grandpa.   Dosen't matter because come January, Homer is going to be marrying him / her [which probably means the he, the kids and Marge are safe].   The full list of [prominent] suspects I would say are:   Smithers  Skinner  Comic-Book Guy [yuck]  Lenny and Carl [they would be perfect for each other]  Patti  Grandpa  Kurt Van Houten [I don't think so]  Chief Wiggum [Poor Ralph and Sarah]   Oh well go to the  urlLink Simpson Archive  and look up their FAQs which includes their  urlLink Homosexual References  in the Simpsons and make up your own mind.

      Well nothing interesting is happening to me currently and I have not yet descended to the level of my new contributors [give it time]; I guess I'll have to talk about the something happening out there in the big bad world.   Here's a nice little story from Alternet that is both amusing and informative. It is an article exposing the  urlLink hypocrisy of the Black Conservative  movement in the US of A. Essentially going over the money behind the organizations.   The amusing part however is the 'Wizard Of Oz'&nbsp;styled revealing of the real controls behind the groups. When [conservative African-American group] Project-21's spokesperson failed to show for an interview on CSPAN recently, it seems the companies director had to fill in. Guess what ethnicity he was?   Unfortunately I'm currently having a weird flashback sensation since I know I've read about prominent Conservative African-American groups being primarily controlled by Caucasian men. However I can't quite remember where I read it now? Darn!

      So back from vacation and the new recruit here in Caddy Powers Vs The World&nbsp;has insulted me .... hmmmm .... I could of course just delete the post or even edit it so that it is nice to me ... but ... I think her insult shows the pettiness of my mother's inability to accept me as her son so I shall leave it there untouched.   As for vacation, well essentially two things were done ... Fishing and Shooting [I'll not mention the drinking as I know you take that as a given].   Fishing was pretty good this year; in the sense that there was no fish. You see I love the boat trip but I hate dealing with the fish / hooks etc. Fortunately the fish weren't biting. I caught the one fish I needed to ensure that I did not have to buy a round of beer [last person with a fish in gets that honour]. Poor Willman however got no fish at all! This led to the lawyer-type argument of whether or not he had to buy the round [he wasn't the last to catch one]. Unfortunately for Willman, I had brought this point up two years ago and he himself had quite firmly told me that it didn't count. So Willman had to buy the round and take the jeers. Oh well, but he is now expecting his first son / daughter in a few months so it's not all bad.   Shooting the next day. I did well for the doubles [launching two clay pidgeons at the same time] but could not hit anything when they did singles. It was embarrassing. At one point I thought they were going to attempt to launch a barn in the hope that I could it the broad side of it.Oh well. I figured out in the last round what I was doing wrong and scored a few points. I lost quite significantly. Willman one by quite&nbsp;a bit.   One bad point to the vacation, my bloody father took his annual hunting tour this year and stayed only a few hundred metres down the road from me. GRRRRR.   Oh well, back to work [and I'm bloody knackered by the whole weekend].

      Almost forgot, it's ten years since Blair took the reigns (of labour). Of course way back then I probably was a bit less of a political junkie -&nbsp;what with still being a kid and all; however I actually ended up watching Blair accepting the leadership due to feeling incredibly lazy with the TV remote control. Now Blair was not my favorite person in the Labour leadership competition. I'd love to claim it was because I could foresee the future and the Iraq mess but it was actually more of the case that he was the guy I didn't know who beat out the people who I actually heard of (making me feel a tad ignorant). I made a note that I just didn't like this Blair guy. Oh well, at least I can now say in all honest that I was a Blair hater from&nbsp;day one.   From my irrational Blair dislike came a far more rational dislike for the "New" Labour party. It had a certain&nbsp;opportunistic sleeze that, at that time, reminded me of how a door-to-door salesman sells his wears. All around me though, everyone was treating New Labour as the saviours of Britain who could do no wrong and would solve all problems. I merely shrugged and said that in time they would&nbsp;be as bad as the Tories. How right I was.   Or to be more accurate&nbsp;how lucky I was on one guess. In truth, I relied on the simple&nbsp;fact that sooner or later all [or at least the vast majority] of prominent&nbsp;politicians end up corrupt and hated. Tony stayed in power too long. Had he gotten out even a couple of years ago,&nbsp;he probably would have many more admirers. For vanities sake, there may be something in having a leadership cap like the eight years maximum an American president like Bill Clinton can serve.   For the record, my other prophecies of the Tory party restructuring themselves [and destroying New Labour once the electorate 'forgot' about the Major / Thatcher years and the shine wore of N. Lab] has yet to happen. Unfortunately thanks to the Lib Dems being completely incapable of building on the anti Labour and Tory sentiment; it is probably only a matter of time before that eventually becomes true.   Oh well, Happy anniversary Mr. Blair

      Imagine you are on a plane and there are 14 Arab men surrounding you all acting suspiciously. They all seem to be signaling each other, passing baggage and taking an unusually large amount of toilet breaks! At one point seven of them even stand in unison! Shock horror!   Okay, so perhaps on a plane you could allow yourself to be panicked. When you find out afterwards that the men were musicians with no criminal records and not on the F.B.I's terrorist lists you would then feel a bit stupid, wouldn't you.   Or would you, like Annie Jacobsen, write an  urlLink article  in&nbsp;nail-bitingly pointless&nbsp;&nbsp;detail which uses this "incident" as proof that racial profiling is needed. Let's face it, terrorists could never be anyone but&nbsp;Arab groups&nbsp;such as the I.R.A [the Irish Republican Arabs] and there is no such thing as&nbsp;white/black Muslims, let alone a Muslim extremist.   I love her last line (and remember she is talking about -innocent- men who have been detained and questioned due to their excessive toilet breaks):    So the question is... Do I think these men were musicians? I'll let you decide. But I wonder, if 19 terrorists can learn to fly airplanes into buildings, couldn't 14 terrorists learn to play instruments?    What's worse the "incident of passengers who freaked on the plane because of the colour of the other passengers skin" seems to be receiving a lot of attention and praise in the U S of A. Now I can understand why this story strikes accord emotionally with people [it is unfortunately quite easy to panic post Sept. 11] but surely this story is a warning against jumping on our base instincts and not as proof that terrorists are hiding everywhere [look out they're right behind you as you are reading this].

      Another issue with the foreign students in the building. One Spanish girl came up to the counter yesterday and asked me where the toilets were. I gave directions in what I thought were the simplest way. Maybe I mumbled a bit, I don't know. Anyway, she looks at me a if I have three heads, goes back to her two friends -who burst into laughter. She then proceeds to do an impression of me (I think - she was speaking in Spanish) while laughing and pointing at me. All this around six feet from my counter. Talk about&nbsp;a blow to the ego  &nbsp;  Unable to yell at her or use my karate chop action (Hiyaaa!) for fear of causing an incident, I am left only with the manly option of bitching about her behind her back.

      A weird story from Australia's  urlLink Syney Morning Hearld . In if they claim that there are witnesses to&nbsp;Iyad Allawi, the new Iraqi Prime Minister, executing 6 prisoners just days before taking power. Now this story could well be bogus, but you have to wonder why a paper makes such a libel ridden claim if it is a fake. Even if you do find the main claim dubious, the fact that Allawi is not that nice a guy does seem to be evident. &nbsp; Iraq being freed from the butcher of Baghdad only be handed over to well a lesser butcher of Baghdad. Who could have possibly forseen that? Still at least he only seems to be killing terrorists, so there is no need to panic.

      According to Aint-It-Cool-News, Dreamworks have beaten out New Line Cinema for the rights to a live action version of  urlLink Transformers . Drat. Not only do I have a strange fondness of New Line&nbsp;at the moment (largely thanks to the  Lord of the Rings  trilogy), but I also have utter contempt for the works of Dreamworks. I don't know what it is about the company but every time I see one of their movies I come out feeling very bored (excluding perhaps  Ants  and&nbsp; Catch me if you Can  where I came out feeling only mildly bored).  &nbsp;  Sigh. Well, here's hoping that Dreamworks gets one&nbsp;film right. &nbsp; I'll also just assume that they're doing a version of the original cartoon and not the cruddy Armada knock-offs. &nbsp; Autobots transform and roll out.

      Ahhhhhhh the fun of monitoring a building in U.C.D. Particularly one full of foreign students aged 12-16. &nbsp; So far it hasn't been too bad, but there was one tosser who really stood out this morning. Inside the building on a&nbsp;sunny&nbsp;(but not that sunny)&nbsp;day and he is wearing sun-glasses. Big ass sunglasses. For a second I was afraid he had a black eye or something and was hiding it. However as soon a he started walking I realised my mistake. He had a "strut" that could only be a result of a appearing on the new MTV show "Pimp my Strut Up". &nbsp; If preformed by most people, I'd assume that they were spoofing Snoop Doggy. But this guy had to look cool. So decked out in his sporty summer gear he strut up and down the corridor with his "C.H.I.Ps style sunglasses" covering half his face looking like some freekish cross between a middle class Italian Momma's boy and Momar: King of all the Pimps. &nbsp; The only redeaming factor of this fashion consious victim was that from the uncovered half of his face it would appear that the glasses were a small mercy for the rest of us.

      Okay, Jack Black in King Kong I can take. I was at first a bit dubious at the casting but upon&nbsp;hearing Peter Jackson discusing the reasoning behind the move I warmed up to the idea.

      Reading through leftie-internet magazine Salon today.  Three articles that are of strange interest. The first two are on Fahrenheit 9/11.  The first of these is a reporter getting  urlLink four US soldiers  to comment on F9/11 (since Moore claims it is getting a great response from army audiences). These army boys aren't nearly as responsive to the "truth" as Moore would indicate. The second is a similar, but not quite as good, article about the  urlLink possible negative effects  the film could have on the populations reaction to the US military.  It's not that I want to insult people in the military (as they are risking lives etc + can beat me up with ease) but I'm not going to put them up on a pedestal and worship them either. However this concern over the military reaction does seem to be a big deal to our American cousins. Besides it is always nice to hear some other perspective on things.  Finally, and off topic for the last two, is a transcript one of the Salon people had with  urlLink Ralph "They're All Out To Get Me" Nader . Maybe my prejudices are coming out again, but he really is getting more and more paranoid sounding.

      Just re-read my Fahrenheit 9/11 interview and realised that I was a bit cruel - I forgot to mention any good points about the film. Since I've ranted enough about it I'll just list a few here rather then give a second (positive) review:  - Brilliant choice of Music (really highlights humour) - Some excellent editing which gets across some good points / laughs (The cut from Prince Bandar describing Bin Ladin to ... I won't spoil it for you is hilarious) - The "success" of the war in Afghanistan is really put into perspective. Great fodder against those who think of him as the war president. - Some very emotional scenes, most obviously the mother of the soldier who died in Iraq (although at the point where she broke down crying felt a tad voyeuristic for me) - Despite the fact that I was familiar with most of the news footage, the clips were very well chosen to give those who do not spend a lot of time going through the news a different perspective then what is often reported.  There can't say fairer then that.

      Never one to flee from controversy,  urlLink Ted Rall's  latest comic points out that the New England Journal of Medicine reported that 14% of American soldiers that they interviewed [for a paper on the effects of the war on soldiers] claim to have been responsible for death of a Civilian Non-Combatant.  Here's a  urlLink link  to the report itself (go to page 6 for the easy to read table of questions answered) if you doubt the legitimacy of comic strip inspired news stories.  Now as Rall's strip point out if we took this 14% figure and applied it to the whole US army in Iraq [145,000] then that means they've killed at least 20,300.  Of course the figure of 14% could be an exaggeration. The marines in the New England experiment had a figure of 28%, most likely since they would have been in more combat / front lines. It is not implausible that the Psychology team specifically picked groups of soldiers who would receive a large amount of combat + therefore had larger figures on average.  Still it seems very hard not to link these results with the Bush Admin. decision not to list the death of enemy combatants or civilians. It also gives credit to those supporters of  urlLink Iraq Body Count  which often gets criticized for putting their figure as [at time of writing] between 11,164 and 13,118 mark. Because lets face it, even if the mechanism they use to record figures has been accused of skewing them up (as often reported); the fact that they only count figures of direct deaths and of those they can find reports of in at least two trusted sources probably means their figures are woefully low compared to the truth.

      So saw the new(ish) Michael Moore film on Sunday.  First off, damn you UGC - you may have a decent selection of movies but you are terrible cinema [the movie was stopped at least five times due to technical difficulties].  So how was the film, you ask. Good, but somewhat pointless for a European audience. Two reaons for this. First bar the footage Moore films himself; most people in Europe [particularly those on the left] will have seen the news footage already as it is more available over here. The only pieces I really don't remember seeing at all was the heart breaking moment when Al Gore has to turn down those wishing to raise objections to the Florida election [because they couldn't get  ONE  senator to sign their petitions] and the interview of Bush when he is on vacation and points out what you can do with telephones and faxes. I almost forgot the bit with him describing his dog digging in the dirt is new to me too (or my brain erased it from my mind to remove the embarrasement).  The second reason the film is somewhat wasted to the European audience is that it is essentially trying to convince swing voters in America to vote against Bush. European [in this case Irish] audiences probably will find less people on the fence about Dubya.   On a personal level I had mixed feelings about it. I personally would have liked a film that concentrated more on the Florida debacle [yes I know it is essentially irrelvant to the topic of the film but I'm one of those odd people who think winning democratic elections by -entirely exposed- fraudulent means is a bit of a sore point and go on about it]. Since Moore choose to focus on Iraq (which I acknowledge is a better choice of subject for his purposes despite my own preferences) I also thought it would have been nice if he had spent a little more time showing that many people around the world were telling the Bush admin. before the war what problems they would face in Iraq. Although he did include footage of the Bush admins original position with Iraq and WMDs (which did a 180 when they wanted the war) which is always funny.  The film also could have been a bit more structured in its approach. I found it very difficult to remember a lot of what happened during the middle of the film upon leaving the cinema. Also I guess I would prefer a film that affected me slightly more intellectually then emotionally (although, once again, I understand that this is a far more effective means of creating anti-Bush propaganda -and I use the term propaganda in its best possible sense here-)  One final point: despite being less liberal with facts in this film, I notice that Moore, at times, opens up valid arguments with rather loose introductions. Considering the amount of people who spend their entire day trying to discredit him (i.e. people like  urlLink Moorewatch ) you would think he would be a bit less sloppy. For example; when raising the issue of the pipeline in Afghanistan, Moore correctly states the importance it had to the Bush administration and its backers. However in introducing this issue Moore, by implication, overplays Bushes role in the initiation of talks with the Taliban and downplays (scratch that, ignores) Clinton's role. Pointing out the democrats role in the beginning of the negotiotiations or just stating that the Bush admin re-started that talks hardly weakens Moores point. Instead his critics will (and have) dissected his first (unimportant) line to discredit his overall correct point that Bush did have other agendas in Afghanistan.  Since Moore is aware of these critics, one has to wonder why these sloppy lines were included. Could it be that he needs these critic's attacks in order to appear to remain radical to his core audience? Who knows?   I'm of the opinion that Mickael Moore was better in his TV Nation stint where he could raise issues that people need to look at rather then being the one to actual explore them in depth. Unfortunately no-one else who can get the same attention is doing it. In all honesty how many people have heard of The Control Room compared to Fahrenheit 9/11. So I guess it is only right that Moore is the one to release this film.  Therefore though it annoys me that he has, for many, become the benchmark standard of a progressive [that's American for leftie]; I certainly can't complain that Moore is ruffling the Bushes feathers.  Overall Rating: For me 7/10 but I say that for most people it is probably somewhere around 8.5/10

      There is an old urban legend of the dangers of picking up hot women (and presumably men) in bars only to be drugged and have your kidneys (or some other organ) removed.  Here is the  urlLink exact opposite story . A religious cult in Aussieland has been accused of faking evidence in order to donate their kidneys to complete strangers (in Australia tries to limit donations to family members only - in order to combat the black market trade in organs).  Okay bar the possibility that members of the cult are being coerced into this (which I guess could be a distinct possibility since it's a cult and all); should people really be prevented from doing unbelievably generous things?

      Howard Dean gives a right verbal smackdown to Ralph Nader according to  urlLink Salon . Good on you Deanie.  To me what is most interesting is that Nader seems to be gaining a large martyr complex. I can't remember where but I'm pretty sure he was moaning that Michael Moore didn't invite him to the Fahrenheit 9/11 premiere in the states a while back.  Come on Raplhie, can't you at least guess at why some on the left / progressive side are really not that pleased with you.

      Just finished reading  The Naked Politician  by Katie Hannon. Not great, not terrible but then again not exactly my area of interest.  It was a book on the lives of TDs in Ireland (and on the of chance that there is a non-Irish person reading this - a TD is an Irish minister, you know a politician ... duh).  One chapter, The Parish Pump, does stick out though. It details out some of the whining requests are national politicians often deal with. These include Ruairi Quinn being asked to get someone's nephew out of a family burial plot and a woman ringing to ask a [unnamed] TD, who she felt looked nice on TV, to help her out when her car broke down!  Weirdest of all, I thought was this:   "More recently, the same secretary [who dealt with the car troubles caller] was contacted by a constituent in search of elephant manure. She had a problem with wild cats and was told that spreading elephant turds on the lawn would keep them at bay. On this occasion, the TD was able to help. Negotiations were opened with Dublin Zoo and the deal was done. The lady got her dung. We will never know for sure if the TD got her vote" [p66]    Spreading elephant dung on your lawn will keep cats away! Who would have thunk it?  Anyway I will ask you to insert your own politician / shit joke as I can't be bothered to think of one.

      You know when your trouble in a political election when commentators start talking about who will be running next time.  Although it is careful to point out that the dems are still taking this election seriously,  urlLink The New York Times  is already talking about Clinton Vs Edwards for leadership of the Democrats in 2008.  Poor Kerry.

      I was reading this article on line from the  urlLink New York Times  (you must register - for free - to read) this mourning - which claims that Republican strategists claim that the reason Kerry took so long to name (the seemingly obvious choice) of Edwards; was that he really wanted their John McCain - which has taken on new relevance with the announcement of Edwards as VP choice.  Therefore, to the Bush people, the VP slot has gone to Kerry's number 2 choice.  Not only is this view sure to appear in the "liberal" media's editorials over the next few weeks in order to weaken the impact of Edwards ... but McCain is being trotted out to speak in favour for Bush over the next few weeks.  Come on, who are they fooling? What did you buy him off with - we know he hates Bush even if he is unquestionably loyal to the party?    Oh well, at least Edwards has made be excited again with the Democrats. Yipppe.   P.S. This McCain strategy seems similar to the Republican pundits assertion that  urlLink Bill Clinton is secretly against Kerry  because he wants Hillary to win in 2008. If only they keep on saying that, I want more " urlLink Republicans for Kerry "

      Now I've  urlLink posted  before about the positive of having Republicans for Kerry (in order to ensure that Hillary does not run in 2008).  Now come on think about it: Kerry / Edwards.  8 Years of Kerry followed by 8 years of Edwards (and if Kerry wins that is not impossible) may be a high price but that is 16 years before Hillary can run.  By then lets jut hope she is past it or has been driven out of politics.  Do it, vote Kerry / Edwards (or don't vote at all if you can't support the donkey) my Republican brothers and sisters.  Every vote for him is a vote against Hillary '08

      They knew that Kerry was going to nominate the VP today ... so the New York Post took a wild stab in the dark and guessed.  Then they put the guess on the front page as fact.  But as  urlLink MSNBC  shows, they didn't go for John Edwards  Now if you are going to make up front page news, you'd think they would go with someone more realistic then Gephardt!

      Looking through some sites trying to see just how good the Westend of Glasgow is for drinking pits. Being that it is Glasgow, I'm assuming quite good.  However two names struck me. The first is the Jedi Bar (in fairness quite a stroll from my dwellings). The other is the Aragon (also quite a stroll from my dwellings).  I never knew drinking pits could double for Nerd Holes. I have only found one reference for the Jedi Bar (which is a good sign that it is either a dive or is long gone) but the Aragon has generally gotten  urlLink good vibes  going about it.  I bet if I made a joke to the barstaff about it being called the "Strider" I will surely get a free pint as no-one before me could possibly have thought of something so funny.

      Yippe, just about half an hour before it's quitting time.  Ten hours babysitting a damn near empty building. Fun, fun, fun.  It is amazing how difficult it is to remain sane without any real activity. Actually that is somewhat less then true as I find it very easy to do sod all; but others can't take the pressure of doing nothing hour after hour and eventually snap. But regardless of my superhuman ability to do nothing, today was exceptionable long and boring as Sunday shifts are not the norm.

      So Brando has left the building.  RIP  Here is a good  urlLink article  in Salon (yes you have to watch their stupid ads to get in but it's worth it) compiling quotes of many peoples first impressions of Brando. Michael Canes and Tennessee Williams stick out.   Michael Caine, actor "Director problem"   "Sidney Furie, who had directed me in 'Ipcress,' was also working at Universal on a picture called 'The Appaloosa,' a western starring Marlon Brando. Sidney came to my dressing room one day almost in tears with horror stories at how badly things were going over on his set. The main problem seemed to be that Brando would not take him seriously.   "I had some free time so I went back with Sidney to the set and met Brando, who was sitting on a horse at the time. We said hello and then Brando asked me what I thought of Sidney as a director. I told him that I thought he was excellent, and Brando said, in front of Sidney, 'I don't think he can direct traffic.'   "Sid just stood there terribly hurt, and I found myself saying, 'It's a western -- there isn't any traffic.' This got a slightly tense laugh after a moment while everybody waited to see if Marlon laughed, which he did and things lightened up a bit." (Hollywood, 1966)   [from "What's It All About?: An Autobiography," by Michael Caine (Turtle Bay Books/Random House, 1992]       Tennessee Williams, playwright  "Household repairs, magnificent reading"   "I first met Marlon Brando in 1947 when I was casting 'Streetcar.' I had very little money at the time and was living simply in a broken-down house near Provincetown [Mass.]. I had a houseful of people, the plumbing was flooded, and someone had blown the light fuse. Someone said a kid named Brando was down on the beach and looked good. He arrived at dusk, wearing Levi's, took one look at the confusion around him, and set to work. First he stuck his hand into the overflowing toilet bowl and unclogged the drain, then he tackled the fuses. Within an hour, everything worked. You'd think he had spent his entire antecedent life repairing drains. Then he read the script aloud, just as he played it. It was the most magnificent reading I ever heard, and he had the part [of Stanley Kowalski] immediately. He stayed the night, slept curled up with an old quilt in the center of the floor."

      Almost forgot to talk about the Saddam footage.  Man, two - completely unserious - points. First, this guy should have lost the uniform years ago, he looks way cooler in civilians. Second, balls of steel. Mass murder he maybe, but he's certainly planning to go down with some jabs at his opponents.  One point Saddam raised is he is still the legitimate ruler of Iraq as the war that toppled him was illegal. Okay, he may have a slight point there. Then again was his coup really all that legal either? So does illegally removing an illegal leader work? Do two illegals cancel each other out? Who knows?  Also if they bring Saddam up on charges of killing Kurds and Iranians using chemical weapons, are we going to see any US officials called to the stand? Go on George, deport your Dad for and have his ass sent over to Iraq.  Finally as interesting a trial as this will be, how public should it be? Fundamentalists can easily re-write there relationship with old Madd As and make him a martyr. Sigh, why can't trials of war criminals be as simple as they were in the good old days.

      I saw  Matchstick Men  last night on DVD. For those who don't know, it is a Ridley Scott movie starring Nicholas Cage as a neurotic (to say the least) Con Man.  It wasn't very good. Now I could go into all that is wrong about this film specifically; however I think what became evident to me was a consistent flaw in Con Movies ...  They are so bloody obvious. Within ten minutes of watching Matchstick Men, I could tell you the ending. Same is true of  Nine Queens  etc etc all the way back to  The Sting  (I can't think of any con films before that of note - at least not right now).  The problem with all these films is that you know it is about con-artists therefore you know the film is going to try to trick you. Therefore you look out for it. Unfortunately few film makers try to anticipate this simple fact.  Real life cons mutate over time, adding in new layers to try to lure people in. For example, I recently checked out a web-site of a company which was offering a special deal on cruises for a friend. It was really a telephone con gig. Normally the person involved would have just hung up on the gits but they were told that the company was legitimate and they could check out there web site. Of course anyone can set up a relatively convincing looking web-site. However for many it can be enough to lure them in on one of the oldest cons in the book.  Con films just don't do that. It is always the last thing you should expect and therefore the first thing you guess. Sigh.

      Those wacky  urlLink left wingers over in Alternet  have been pointing out how coverage of John Kerry in 2000, when he was considered for the VP spot, is completely different then the media commentary he is getting now. back then he was seen as a way of bring charm and personality to the Gore ticket. Now it is said he needs charm and personality brought to his ticket.  Hmmm, John Kerry both charismatic and good looking. I can believe the first, I suppose. As for the 2nd, Kerry's looks range from good to butt ugly depending on the camera angle used (or so it appears to me).  Maybe they just took more flattering pictures 4 yrs ago.  Okay, so I don't like Kerry; however this is another example of how if you repeat the same thing over and over again [in this case Bush is the common as salt kind of Guy and Kerry is a snob when in fact they're both snobs] people will believe it.  It's like the Bush is funnier then Gore (I mean ha, ha funny not weird). If that is so then I would love to have seen Bush on Futurama. Twice. Al Gore kicked ass. The line that went something like "That would lead to the destruction of the space-time continuum and as an environmentalism - I'm against that" was hysterical. As was his declaration of being against environmental pollution and evil wizards in his 2nd guest spot. At least Tony "Yes Sir" Blair got a line of the Simpsons. Just not a very good one.

      So Republican Jack Ryan has a liking for sex clubs and people watching him as he is doing the business. Pity for him him wife, Jerri Lynn Ryan (7 of 9 from Star Trek / that Russian chick from Dark Skies), didn't go in for it and is now divorcing him.  Personally the news doesn't bother me. She seems to hold nothing against him and he didn't have affairs etc etc. So he's a bit hypocritical, what politician isn't.  However one thing is being over looked in all this. Won't somebody please think of the Trekkies! Those poor guys are probably high tailing it down to the local sex club in the hope that another Star Trek baby has a husband who is just as kinky as Jack Ryan.  Come on Jack, don't get their hopes up - it's not like they have anything else to live for.

      Yesterday I was given the opportunity of watching a DVD of Shrek 2.  Hmm now something stopped me. And this time it wasn't just my frustrating honesty, I really just didn't feel like watching Shrek 2.  Now I wan't a huge fan of the first, but I got to admit the positive reviews of the film + of the character of Puss in Boots had created a little excitement within me about seeing this.  That excitement is now dead. Everytime I turn on the TV I see the same stupid Shrek 2 ads. I swear if I here "I'm a stallion" one more time I am going to get a shotgun and kill every talking donkey / horse in Ireland.  Everytime I look at a bustop I see a poster of one of those CG characters staring back at me. Or some git telling me they poisoned someone (stupid hygiene and so forth).  Everytime I'm in a shop I see another poster of ... Screw it, you get the idea.  Shrek 2 has broken all kinds of Box Office records in the states. Could it possibly because we have all been brainwashed by millions spent on advertising? In fact what is the last blockbuster you can think of that didn't have an odd $30 million behind its advertising.  In Ireland that's probably Intermission, and lets face it - it had the home crowd advantage. Apart from that all I can think of is "My Big Fat [not so great] Greek Wedding". And even that received alot of media attention half way through its run.  Damn advertising. And damn lack of successful films that succeed without huge advertising. And damn Shrek 2 for taking the piss at how much ads a film can produce.

      Oh here are things I was meant to mention in the week but just couldn't be bothered to.  1.\ I mentioned earlier about the  urlLink disgraceful casting of the Green Lantern  and said that it couldn't possibly be true. Now according to  urlLink Ain't It Cool News , it isn't. They say that despite their first story that the film has not being green lit [pun not intended] and Jack Black is not in as GL in a screw ball comedy version of the comic superhero. Actually what they claim is that the negative reaction their story caused made the studio axe it. Initially I thought this was self hype ['even when we are wrong we are still right'], but there maybe some truth to the claim. It appears that Jack Black was approached about the idea according to urlLink  Cinescape , but he turned it down because there was no script. Seems that Time Warner did have a mind to turn GL into a farce. Oh well, good news for GL fans bad news for Jack Black fans [no-one with any credibility should even consider doing something like a mad cap GL film dammit]. Oh yeah I almost forgot, changing the GL powers so that they are now Nanite technology. WTF. That is pretty much as bad as the screwball comedy. Then again, I am somewhat emotional about the overuse of bloody nanites - stupid little SOBs.  2.\ Not only have the Bush Admin being asking foreign govertments to  urlLink arrest high profile terrorists  during the Democratic Parties Convention, but it also seems that the month before the election is going to be national preparedness against terrorists month [or some similarly stupid title]. Of course none of that is going to be used to the advantage of Bush - who is only holding ground with Kerry thanks to the American public's view that he is doing a better job on the war on terror then Kerry would. This all comes from Bob Harris over on  urlLink This Modern World  [guest blogging for Dan Perkins aka Tom Tomorrow]. He also has a delightful picture of Bush playing rugby from Bushes Yale yearbook - ouch the poor git he is punching. Okay it is a cheap shot but hey - screw it I'm pissed off today - I'm going to be partisan without the apology today. NOTE Here is a  urlLink direct link  to the story (on Alternet) in case you don't want to go through all that Tom Tomorrow stuff [shame on you].  3.\ I read an article in the Irish independent [hey it was a one time deal, it was free, the computer was down and there was nothing else to do in the office] and they had an article on the guy who came up with the foreign students program to Ireland. Normally I don't have a problem but with those couple of very annoying experiences of mocking students in with me this year, I have to say I felt like I wanted to give him the old Karate Chop Action [heeeyaaa].

Have barely ate this week, everyday has been annoyingly stressful both during and after work and I can't sleep with the bloody heat during the week + had no sleep during  the weekend before due to having two friends back from the Albion Side. Okay the last one wasn't so bad, but still ... Grrrr. Oh wait, is that the annoying rolling sound of skateboarders I hear [for those of you that are not aware one of the few annoying things my -normally- stress free job requires of me is to chase those little gits away; this makes them not my most favourite people in the world].

      Okay you all know about the Nigeria Scam. The victim gets an e-mail informing them that they have been selected to filter out money from Nigeria and will get a very large fee in return. Of course the scammers put a bit more effort to make it sound more realistic then my quick little condensed version [but not much more]. Eventually the poor sod who is greedy enough to fall for this has to pay a small transaction fee in order to get the money through [small in relation to the millions that are coming ... large by most other standards] and strangely never hear back fro the banks in Nigeria.  However here is a  urlLink nice variation of the same trick . The variation is that the scammers are pretending to be the chairman of a group set up in Nigeria in order to track down the nasty con-men. They have now recovered millions which they need to distribute back ... I'm sure you can see where this is going. Nice idea, but can anyone really be dumb enough to fall for the same trick twice [since the scam seems to be designed only to effect people already conned].  PS  To hear the tales of one of the poor unfortunates conned by the original scammers go to the  urlLink Landover Baptist Church website .

In fact there have been some rumours that this MA is in fact my mother [and not so frequent poster here at Caddy Powers vs The World] AHD. This is of course one of those unconfirmed type rumours; but it is quite probably true.  Either way my mother is flying of to American in a week or so.  Was I invited to the going away doo? No. Was I consulted on would I like to go to the States with my mum? No.  Sometimes AHD can be so cruel [Sob].

      I've an idea for some fun: Let's try to represent a very dodgy part of American history [the internment of Japanese Americans] as a necessary and fundamentally correct procedure and use it to justify the implementation of a similar wave of dodgy behavior [the internment of Arab Americans].  Oh wait,  urlLink Michelle Malkin  has beaten me to it. Darn, I was looking forward to that!  UPDATE Here is another  urlLink link  that shows off some of Michelle's personality in a little more light [from the leftie site Media Matters - run by David Brock who I am a tad suspicious off; although I like the site]. I personally like the quote about removing a former Japanese internment victim from the Bush Admin; as his past experience may cloud his judgement over what needs to be done today. Err ... um ... okay.

      Ugggh, I was hoping for an easy day today as I have alot of personal stuff to get done. This of course was a stupid thing to think as this morning I've been running around like a little piggy set on fire.  Of course my job has made me more susceptible to feeling hard done by when actually faced with work; however please believe me when I say I was being over-worked.  Even better was that there was a group of repeat students on the steps of my building waiting for their exams. There was actually a problem with their room which required me to repeatedly run between my building and another neighboring building to get keys etc to sort out the room. There I was running - like Small Ball of Fire after Orlando Bloom - trying to sort something out for them; and they think it is a funny joke. Urrgh, if I wasn't a staff member [and therefore unable to commit violence against students] it would have been karate chop action time [Heeeyaaaa!].  Still things have tarted to quiet down allowing me to get some posts in.

      Right after  urlLink This Modern World ,  urlLink Tom the Dancing Bug  and  urlLink Ted Rall ;  urlLink The Boondocks  is without doubt my favorite comic strip (currently running - otherwise the Far Side would have to be in there). Okay so it is not exactly my favorite ... but it's up there.  Therefore I let out a little whooop when I heard that Cartoon Network want to make it into a  urlLink half hour TV show . Hopefully it works out, gets made, is half decent and doesn't end up getting cancelled real quick like Dilbert.  Arrggghhh, the show Dilbert still brings pain to me. Not due to the quality or anything [I thought it was passable enough] but because one time I was ill with a minor fever and a lot of medication and I was watching an episode [about Dilbert creating the world's most popular painting - a blue duck] when during the title credits I figured out the meaning of life. I felt pretty smug about myself and watched the episode and then promtly forgot about the MoL. Agggghhhh. Those title credits still haunt [and mock] me to this very day.

      Good old Trent Lott and his words of wisdom. According to the old dear we should not  urlLink switch horses mid stream  [in reference to voting in Kerry during the War on Terror].  Maybe he has forgotten where he last heard that expression. Wasn't it the campaign slogan in  Wag the Dog  [which both Dustin Hoffman and Denis Leary's characters found so pathetic].

      Okay, now I was going to just respond to my doubtful mother however I also wanted to include a link, so I decide just to post a new topic. Okay according to my mother [see comments to last post] I merely imagined the whole ending of Ulysses 31 [with suspision like that no wonder she does not believe I'm her soon]. She then goes into some weird rant of Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors.  First of, the 'bad planet' is named Saw Boss [it could be one word - I don't know]. According to J. Michael Straczynski, one of the main writers of the show,  the series was cancelled - so he must have missed the wedding episode. As for Jayce creating the planets, well she is half right. It was Audric, Jayce's father, who accidently created the Monster Vines when a solar flare errupted as he was creating a new planet to erradicate world hunger. So as you can see my Mother's fantasies about cartoons are a bit off.  As for Ulysses 31, here is  urlLink a script of the last episode . If that is not enough, but the bloody series on DVD [they've just released it] and you'll see that I and that boreish man [I mentioned in the last post] were right.  P.S. Jayce marrying Saw Boss, couldn't you have been more realistic and have He-Man marry Man-At-Arms?

      Far be it from me to disagree with my mother, but I can, at last, confirm that she is wrong ... at least about the French animated TV series  Ulysses 31 . She claimed that it just went on for ever in her childhood, repeating itself without end. A friend of hers, who is as lazy as he is stupid, claimed there was a last episode and that he vaguely recalled seeing it twice whilst a child. Since the show is being repeated ad nauseum on Fox Kids, I tried to keep an eye out for this so-called last episode [I could have checked on the internet of course, but that would have been too easy]. As Fox Kids begain to endlessly repeat the show, each cycle through I failed to see a last episode - and I begain to suspect that my mom's friend was either deluded or a liar.  However last night I saw it. It seems old Ulysses does get to the Kingdom of Hades; the place where Zeus said his crew would be free [in the boringly titled episode  The Kingdom of Hades ].  The episode resolves around the fact that it seems that while old Ulysses, the kids and No-No can get home, the crew of the Odyssey have to stay as citizens of Hades. Of course Ulysses ain't going to stand for that.  Oh well, enough for that trip down memory lane and back to work where I am still currently as sick as a dog. This summer has been rather harsh to me illnesswise as I think I've been down and out every second weekend. Sigh.
