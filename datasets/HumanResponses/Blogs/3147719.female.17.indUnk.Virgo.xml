      Last Monday, we had a JOHO class (information technology class), and Mr. Tanabe told us to make our own home pages. The aim of doing that is to let other students know our character and to learn how to make home pages through a trial and error process. I decided to introduce my hobbies, especially NAIL ART! I can't clearly remember when I started to take an interest in nail art, but I think it was more than five years ago. Because I had liked art since I had been three or four years old, I soon got crazy about nail art at the moment I saw it on a magazine!  Today, I had one day off!!!!!!! It was anniversary of the founding of a school! I wanted to go somewhere, but I decided to stay home because I was a little tired. I don't know why, but I feel very exhausted lately. Because of much homework??

      Last Thursday, Mr. Kringle told us to blog every week. So I started to blog for the first time. I've already got my homepage with a diary section, but I rarely write the diary...(^_^;) Well, this page is really PINK. I think everybody knows that I LOVE pink. It took more than three hours to change colors and settings in this page! It was fun, though...  Oh...It's already been a week since school started. Yesterday, I had two chemistry classes and two math classes. Since I chose  2 rui  (the course in which students mainly learn math and science subjects), my class schedule is so hard!!(x_x) I have math and science subjects every day except Friday.  Today, I went shopping to Yokohama (without doing my homework...). And I found stores had changed a lot since I had gone there two months ago. My favorite store (Mini Plaza) was closed down (T_T), and a new store called IT'S DEMO opened where Mini Plaza used to be. IT'S DEMO sells similar goods to what Mini Plaza sold, so I wasn't really shocked. Also, it had lucky bags in celebration of the opening of the store! Most stores sell lucky bags on New Year's Day in Japan, and women run around the awfully crowded shopping area with many lucky bags. (Sometimes I see men who have many heavy bags. Maybe they are told to do so by their girlfriends or wives... Poor men...) Anyway, I like lucky bags because I don't know what is in them until I open them. I think they are attractive to both men and women! Why do only women get crazy about them...??

      My mother has been sick since she had a operation for cervix cancer last year. It was an early stage of cancer, but she suffers the aftereffects of the operation even now. Symptoms of menopause appeared at once after she took of her uterus. Headache, Backache, sickness... and depression. I was so surprised and felt relieved a little to know that great many people in Japan are suffering from depression these days. What on Earth causes depression?? I think there are many reasons, and they are all different for different people. But anyway, my mother is getting well. She says that she feels better and refreshed when talking with me. I think it is really important to support depressed people in many ways...

      Mid-term tests are coming in a week!! We (nirui students) have math III, math C, physics, chemistry IB, chemistry II, and English tests!!!! I am really panicked now...  These days, I am reading "Genji Monogatari" ("Tale of Genji"), and I really love this story. Genji Monogatari is a story written by Murasaki Shikibu (a female servant of the royal court) in the early 11th century. It is one of the earliest novels in Japan and is sometimes said to be the oldest novel in the world! It tells the story of the a fictional character, named Hikaru Genji. He is a handsome son of the Japanese emperor, who is delegated to civilian life for political reasons and begins a career as an imperial officer. The tale concentrates in his romantic life and gives an impressive portrait of the customs of the time. Also, an important part of the book is waka (poetry) which is very hard to understand. Because the culture in the 11th century is really different from now, reading an annotated version which I am reading now is quite common. I often think classical Japanese literature is so impressive and good for us because we can learn the Japanese spirit which we are forgetting these days...

      Tomorrow, my HAPPY Golden Week starts!!! Hooray!!! Why did we have school today?? Golden Week　GENERALLY　starts on April 29th, I think. Almost everybody in Japan were enjoying their holidays while we were studying at school todayl!! That's not fair!!! ...Anyway, I am really happy now. I don't have school any more (till next Thursday)! I can relax at home, go shopping, and... do a lot of homework... Well, actually, I can't relax during holidays because I have MANY things to do! Also, I have to practice riding a bicycle because we are going CYCLING in Hokkaido! I have tried many times before, but I have never been able to ride a bicycle...

      Final tests are coming in a week(+_+)!!!!!!! I am totally exhausted from studying (I have 11 subjects to study!!). I have no time, but I did nail art a little today because I wanted to relax. I often do nail art (or play with nail polish?) during vacation because it really makes me feel better! I don't remember exactly when I started to buy nail polish and other nail art goods. Maybe more than five years ago?! Nail art has become very popular in Japan these days, but still, many people think we shouldn't do it. When I used black nail polish last summer, my mother complained about the color. Are black nails strange??? Well, maybe... they seem unhealthy. But... I NEED(?) to coordinate the color of nails with my clothes; That's my policy. No matter what anyone tells me, I never change my idea! I think a nail artist is a good career for me... &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Hey! Why have I been so busy these days?????????? I'm almost dying!!!!!!!!!! I think teachers have given us too much homework!!!!!!!! ...and too many tests. I wish I could go to beautiful and comfortable Hokkaido again!! How many of you like blogging???? I really LOVE blogging because I like using computers. If I had a lot of free time, I could spend hours and hours on my computer!!!!!!!! Especially, I like surfing websites and making my own homepage. Using computer sometimes makes me feel sick though. (I have a chronic headache because I have poor eyesight...)

      Yesterday, I came back home from five-day trip with a lot of souvenirs. I was so tired that I slept more than twelve hours!! What I was so surprised was the temperature in Hokkaido. It was high like that in Tokyo though it was less humid. Fortunately, it was sunny every day except the first day. So we(2nd group) could ride bicycles on the last day of the trip. I heard 1st group couldn't ride bicycles... I really enjoyed every moment in the trip. We played cards every day in the bus, talked a lot in the hotels every night(We stayed up late at night...), and ate ice cream!! I wish I could go to Hokkaido again... I wanted to go to Hakodate and Sapporo!! Maybe I can go there after I became a university students...
