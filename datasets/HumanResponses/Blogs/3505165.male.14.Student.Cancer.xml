      Freedom- the ability to do what you want, when you want. But are we really free?  Of course not.........dont be silly. If we were free would we have any laws. Would we have to have prisons. Would we have any government at all.  To be totally free, we would have to rid ourselves of all establishments of government, which is an anarchy.  Now i dont know about you guys out there, but I personally prefer to have it so that a killer can  NOT  come into my house at night and kill me.  Sooooooooooo............I guess what I'm really trying to say is:  "All you poser anarchists out there are really annoying and have no idea what you are saying."

      I had a Physical today. Lots of fun; nurses attaching things to my arms, doctor hitting my knees with his thingy, and shining lights into my eyes.  When we get screened for scoliosis in school each year, they always say that I have it and suggest that I have my doctor look at it. Well, this time, the doctor told me to do all the regular stuff (bend down, touch your toes, stand up straight and spin around in circles) and he said that I have mild scoliosis but it is due to the fact that one of my legs is shorter than the other. Then he called my dad in, and was pointing out how my hips are tilted, and the line at the fold of skin at the bottom of my knee-pit (that's the back of your knee for those of you without my specialized vocabulary) is at slightly different heights on each leg becuase of the difference in lengths.  Well, now at least I can say that I am one of the few people I know that has legs of different lengths.   I FEEL SOOOO SPECIAL   This is "Different-Leg-Length Boy" signing off.

      I had Summer Baseball practice today, for 2 hours. It was so pointless, becuase I got the ball probably only 2 times that entire scrimmage. And then I stuck out every single time I got up to bat, which was only twice, and that is pretty sad, because we were facing a thirteen-year old team.  And i missed the fake, 8th grade girls softball all-star game.  *Tears and sadness*  I really felt bad for Chris today, and I've decided that Kelly is on my list of people who I strongly dislike, for the time being. She just should not have said yes if she did not like him in the first place.   Arrrrgggghhhhhh!!!!!!!   Oh and Chris and I have only told one person who Conor likes. But it was not even really my fault. Chris was really the one who told Maria.  Okay fine, so it was partly my fault, but that doesn't really matter.  Don't get lost now.

      The 8th Grade Social was last night.  It was pretty fun. It was cool seeing all the girls wearing nice dresses and things and all the boys wearing nice shirts. And I got a lot of practice doing my Chris/Indianna Jones/Harrison Ford half-smiley thing. I think i look pretty good doing it. Hahaha.  Loula and the other peoples kept trying to get me and Lindsay to dance together, and when we finally were, Mr. Phelan came over and told us that we needed to separate a little and not be so close to each other.  They had free slush, I only had 5 of them.  At the end, as the last songs were playing, some of the girls started crying. But by the time we were heading out, I think pretty much every single girl was in tears. Brianna was practically hysterical. When I first saw and heard her crying, I thought she was just pretending becuase she was just bawling. Then she came over and gave me a hug and said that she would really miss me, and I realized that she as acutally seriously crying.  I really just dont understand girls. When we were standing outside, me and ian and billy were standing together, surrounded by all these crying girls, and we were just talking about how we would be seeing each other in two whole days. I can sort of understand it if people start crying on Wednesday, when some people are actually going away, adn we might never really see them again, but not on a Friday when we still have 3 days of school left.  But, girls are just like that. Sometimes I just do something that I find totally fine, and then I realize that girls want to be doing something else instead. Like, I think it was the last song, and they announced that if you still wanted a slush you should go and get one, so I asked Lindsay if she wanted a slush, and she was said sure. So when went and got slush (I got two) and were eating them and I then Lindsay said something like, "Peter, can we please just finish this last dance. I'm a girl and care about this mushy stuff."  and i didnt even realize that a girl would want to do that, probably partly bucause I really like slush and and wouldnt miss a chance to get some more for free.  Now this might make no sense to anyone, bucause I just went back and read it and it barely makes sense to me, but I think you might sort of get what I am talking about.  This is Chicken Man, signing off.  ps. All the girls looked really pretty in dresses, except for the weird uglyish ones, but I wont get into that.  pps. Michelle invented the best dance move ever, the "Daddy, where are you" move.  ppps. Oh and Chris came up with one of the worst dance things ever, you all stand in a line and turn your arms around each other.  pppps. Congo lines are fun, especially during songs that shouldnt have them in the first place  ppppps. Lindsay looked really pretty in her skirt and shirt.

      Hey guys,  Well school gets out in.....uhhh........oh yeah.... 6 and a half days!!!!!!!!!!   yay!!!!!!!!  I can not wait until summer, I am so bored of school. But then again, I always am so I guess that's no big change.  If you could be any condiment in the world what would it be?????  hmmm.... I think I'd choose guacomole, 'cause I'm probably the least likely to get eatin that way.  If you could be any meat dish, what would it be?  I would be a hot dog, becuase who knows what really in it.  If you could be any amount of money what would it be?  $42.00

      Ronald Reagan died this weekend.  I was driving in my car with my dad to Luke's house to hang out and we were listenting to a thing about him on NPR. It was many different sound clips of him, making speeches, making announcements and whatnot.  And all through the whole saddening, tear-bringing thing, the only thing I could think about was about how long they must of had this ready for when he finally kicked the bucket.  Now, does being so, well, I don't really know......I guess.......cynical, make me a bad person. Maybe being so cynical is just my way of overcoming the sadness that I should be feeling since of of our most famous presidents has just died. Or maybe the sadness just doesn't affect me because I wasn't alive while he was president.  I remember seeing footage of JFK's assassination, and remember thinking how sad it must of been to be alive for that. That's one of those events where you will always remember what was happening that day when you found out.  Like, I can't really remember what happened for the first part of the day, but I can recall like it was yesterday what happened on 9/11 when we found out about the terrorist attacks. There were rumors going through the school that something had happened in New York, because I guess that some teachers had let it slip, or had shown their students what was happening on TV. But at the very end of the day in homeroom, I remember they made a short, puzzling announcement to the effect of:  "Earlier today some planes crashed into buildings in New York and Washington D.C."  And that was pretty much it. They gave us no information, absolutely nothing besides the facts that some planes had crashed. That pretty much left us to make our own ideas. I can remember Jimmy Fahey saying on the bus that it was probably some terrorists who hated the U.S., and I was saying that he was wrong and that it would turn out to be some crazy Americans who didn't like the government or something.  I don't really think that any of us understood the full extent of what had happened that day until we got home and just sat there, in front of the TV, for hours, just watching the news coverage.  They kept showing the planes crashing into the towers again and again, non-stop, just imprinting it into your brain.  The next day in Writing class, I remember that Ms. Connell made us write in our journals our reactions to what had happened the day before. All I was able to write was pretty much the fact that 2 planes had crashed into the World Trade Towers, one into the Pentagon, and one that might of been on it's way to the White House or Camp David. But I distinctly rememeber that Harry Edwards wrote a poem about it. I can't remember how any of it went except for the very last two lines. But those lines will probably stick with me for the rest of my life. It went:    Yesterday there was no fun, Yesterday was 9-1-1     I don't know why it was that that snagged in my brain, but it was, and that it was I will always remember.

      What is the point of school?  Okay fine.....I can sort of see that school is supposed to teach you stuff that you can learn later on, but I learn practically nothing in the majority of my classes. For instance, who didn't already know that volcanoes spew out lava, which is pretty much the extent of what Ms. Bertrand teaches us. That class is soooooooo boring. And what about math class; they claim that they level the classes, but it is really just split into the stupid kids, adn everyone else. Why not just have an actual class with actual smart kids who actually know stuff. Mrs. Mikels has to give me these stupid worksheets so that "I am challenged in class."  Sorry about my ranting but I would just like to point out the fact that  I HAVE LEARNED PRACTICALLY NOTHING IN MANY OF MY CLASSES AND IT'S BORING AS HECK .    p.s. how come we are the only class who hasn't even gotten to the point in Root's where his leg gets cut off. We never really watch it anymore.
