      Today is my last post for the next three weeks, I am going to the Upper Peninsula.  Time for beer bashes, pontune rides, lake livin, and just plain summer fun.  I will be driving most of the way and the drive can take anywhere from eight and a half to 11 hours.  I will be able to drive all the time up there because I am the only one underage besides my sister and she is staying down here to work.  She is so poor she even owes me money.  The sad thing is, I can't even pay attention.  Today all I get to do is pack and maybe put away groceries if I'm lucky.  I am going to RC sports to buy a new stringing kit for my stick because I need something to do for three weeks, and is going to take a full day for me to string it.  I have been listening to a lot of music I usually would make fun of.  I kinda like country now.  My favorite country song is "Cause the Chicks Dig it".  I also like "Hell Ya", "Redneck Woman", "Beer for my Horses", and "If you Ever Stop Loving me".  I've had nothing else to do all summer except junior golf.  I am fifteen and I have to golf with, like, 12-year-olds.  At least I get to hang out with one of my best friends, Jake.  Jake is probably the only friend I have who my parents or my sister doesn't make fun of or say they are a bad influance.  He is also the only friend I have that is almost exactly like me.  We both play sports.  We are golf buddies and I got him to try lacrosse and he got me to try hockey.  They are very similar.  We also both have older sisters who we dispize.  Our sisters are also kinda friends.  My sis is a church lady and so is his.  That is why my sis thinks Jake is "good people".  I have a couple of friends who are really nice to me and some who i could do without.  I have one friend who is a real hard ass.  His name is Ben and he can be an on and off friend.  When we are one on one or with some of my other close friends we are really tight.  Any other time...he gets pissy.  My old best friend, Eric, was one of the nicest people I know.  Keyword...WAS.  He started hanging out with some real tards.  This one kid Tony really gives me a hard time.  Eric and I started hanging out less, then we stopped talking on the phone, then he changed his AIM name and never told me.  Now we have verbal battles in the middle of classes.  I still try to talk to the old Eric every once in a while, but he is almost gone.  That is about it for today's sob story.  I tried to give you enough to last for three weeks, but I'm not sure.  Maybe next time I'll talk about my friends who are girls...not girlfriends (I'm a loser).  Now the Rachels and Christene won't feel left out.  I can't forget Kelley either.

      I had a blog on blogeasy, but my comp screwed up every time i signed in.  This is my first blog in a while, but I'm sure it will be a smooth ride.  My life can be interesting at some points, and sometimes it isn't.  I play JV lacrosse for my high school and next year i will most likely make varsity because my postition (defense) will be needed.  Follow my life as I walk through the halls of Davison High School and battle with depression, weight loss, girls, and homework.  Right now it is the summer and I am leaving in three days to spend a few weeks up at my cabin on Lake Gogebic.  There are some nice places to eat *cough* and drink *cough*.  I have my driving permit so i can drive with a parent.  That makes me the designated driver.  I might post tommorow and then I'm off.  See you in 3 weeks.

      My trip to the U.P. was pretty uneventful.  There were a couple of cool things, though.  I got to drive on the way up there but my mom was freaking out because she was falling asleep and the over 21 driver cant fall asleep.  She got some coffee and took over.  I only got to drive for about three hours.  We also got some really good pasties from this place around the Seiney Strech.  My mom likes hers with lots of vegetables.  I just got mine with meat'n'taters...  While we were up there out neighbors, who actually own the country club down here, had a surprise party.  The Minto family was having a surprise party for the husband, Mike.  He was turning fifty.  My family are close friends with there family and we went.  They are on the other side of the lake and it was going to be a boat tour, so we drive our ghetto boat.  It is a 20 foot pontune boat that only has a seat for the driver so we have to bring plastic chairs on.  It is a lot of boat to be pushed by a 28 horse motor.  It takes a good 1/2 hour to go the three miles acrosse the lake.  The party at the house was very fun.  I started out with Mike getting home from Brook Trout fishing (which was a set up).  We had drinks and apatizers for like 20 mins and then we got on the boats and headed north for the Hoop'n'Holler.  Our boat was the first off the dock, and there were about five there.  We were going full tilt because we knew everyone would catch up to us.  When they did one of the people had a really big speed boat.  We got caught in its wake and it drove our front under.  We got to the Hoop and found out that one of our pontunes was leaking.  I chose to stay and my parents and our guests went back home.  Everyone else went to sandy beach.  It is the only public sandy place on the lake that isn't a campground.  We then left to go to a bar just off the lake that is called the Locker Room.  We had to dock somewhere and walk like 5 blocks to the bar.  Everyone was whining the whole time.  I found it refreshing.  The Locker Room is some crappy little sports bar, but the pool was free and so was the popcorn.  I got the jukebox to play for free and we played some drinking songs and a few other things.  Eventually some friends of my mom's handed me a beer, a cigarette, and put a big uncle sam hat on me and took a picture.  That went over well.  *rolls eyes*.  We eventually went back to the house and my parens and our guests were waiting there (they took a car).  The party was VERY nice.  When we go there after the tour I look around and said, "There are a lotta pretty women here..."  The oldest Minto child is a girl who is like 22.  Her name is Mandi.  She seemed to have brought a couple of her friends along with her.  I spent most of my time with them.  We talked about how highschool has changed and she noticed the sandals I was wearing.  They are the filp=flops with a strap instead of that toe thing.  They are black maroon and gold and say cardinals highschool on them.  She was ranting about how the cardinal shop never hooked them up with cool stuff like that.  I actually got them at wal-mart for like 7 bucks.  We got a new boat the next day.  It was another 20 footer, same brand, but it had seats.  It had a rear entry with built-in ladder, a tow cable for tubing, and a 50 horse/4-stroke/Merc that is really fast for a pontune that size.  We can pull a tuber but not a skier, the motor isn't THAT strong.  My grandparents came up and some meanial stuff happened.  My mom and I were alone for the last week because my dad obviously has to work.  On his last night here we went out ith his buddies on our boat.  Dad got smashed and we all laghed because he could barely stand up.  He also had a loss of short term memory.  He was fine the next day and flew out at about 11.  The trip home was about the same as the way up.  Now I'm getting ready to go hang out with one of my friends.  If one of my friends is readying this, call me when I get home.  I have a lot of summer to make up for.  Thanks for reading!  Mood-figity Music-vh1 cntry music (channel 114 on charter digital)

      Hi everybody.  I'm sorry about the long wait.  I forgot I was keeping a blog.  I also was debating whether to use this or a Live Journal.  You obviously can see what I wanted to choose.  I was talking to a friend the other day I haven't seen or talked to in a while.  Her name is Kelley.  She was telling me about this nice guys finish last thing her boyfriend sent her.  I read over it and it sounded a lot like me.  I showed it to a few other friends and they said it hit the nail on the head.  All of it except this part about being the guy who is the designated driver and not taking advatage of girls at the door, cause I'm only 15 and can't drive by myself yet.  The link to it is:  urlLink http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~jenf/writing/rant04.html .  One part sounds a lot like something that happened about a month ago.  If you are a close friend, you know which part.  Well, that is it for now.  If I post tommorow it will probably be about my schedual and back to school stuff.  TTYL
