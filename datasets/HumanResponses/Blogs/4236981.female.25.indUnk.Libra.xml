      I was asked a couple days ago about some advice on love. Being a married woman, I was ezpected to know what love is. But the truth is, I don't think I myself understand what love is. Oh, I've been told by my parents what love is supposed to be, but I still don't think I fully understand what love is. If you're a Christian, you learned in church, love your neighbor as yourself. How can you love your neighbor when you don't love yourself?? How can you fully understand what love is when you don't love yourself?? It says in the Bible "Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, etc. etc." Until you can accept who you are as a human, and as a child of Christ, I don't think any of us can understand the true meaning of love. I've always been told that love is a choice that you make each day. Its not a warm, fuzzy feeling. Its not just an emotion or anything like that junk. Its a conscious choice that is made each day when you wake up. A choice that means you are going to give 110% to do whatever necessary to make others feel accepted unconditionally.

      I've heard it said that beauty is only skin deep.  A lot of single guys, when "hunting" for women look at the looks first.  They think "she's cute" and so they go to talk to her.  For women its different.  Looks is not the most important agenda on the list.  Women are more mentally/emotionally based, so they look for things like humor, honesty, reliability.  Things like that.  I know for myself.  Looks wasn't the first thing that attracted me to my husband.  The first thing that attracted me to him was his personality.  So, then, when it comes to a long-term relationship, or even marriage, should looks really matter?  It says in the Bible "Your looks should not come from outward adornment such as the wearing of gold jewelry & fine clothes.  Instead, it should be that of your inner self, a gentle and quiet spirit which is of great worth in God's sight."  If we, as women, live according to that passage for beauty, then our personality and good features should shine through and attract people, right??? Now, that doesn't mean that you should look shabby every day of the week!!! lol  But by letting your inner beauty shine through, you'll want to keep yourself nice looking, presentable, and approachable on the outside as well.  And, I've recently realized, once you have a man, that doesn't mean you don't have anyone to impress anymore.  You should want to keep looking good for your mate, not get lazy or so "comfortable" with each other that you don't care what the other person looks like.

      Depression seems to be a big thing in my life right now.  If I'm not the one depressed, then its one of my co-workers, or others dear to me that are depressed. I grew up with depression.  I figure it started when I was pretty young, probably Grade 3, when I started going to a private Bergthaler school.  I was in the minority group (one that didn't go to that kind of church). So a lot of people knew each other, but I was an outsider to begin with.  The girls were okay with me, but the boys were cruel.  They would call me names, and when I would walk down the hall, they would move as far over to the other side of the hall as they could, so they didn't have to walk by me.  That was a real blow to my self esteem.  You'd think it would just be a phase that boys go through, but no, it continued on through high school.  In grade 7, I met my best friend.  I formed my own little group of those that weren't popular with any of the other groups.  Through school I sunk deeper into my depression.  I knew I was depressed, but I hid it very well.  Those around me had no idea that I was depressed.  I was one of those people that put on a happy face when around other people, while I was crying inside.  Finally, in Grade 10, my depression got too much for me to contain, and it started to show in my schoolwork and in my mood.  I tried killing myself several times.  Once was by overdosing on Aspirin.  I was sick as hell, but no one found out.  I also tried slitting my wrists a few times, but that didn't work.  In my Grade 12 year, I finally had some counselling.  I went to Christian Counselling Services where a psychiatrist put me on different anti-depressants.  Nothing really helped me.  I just kept going through life wallowing in my depression.  I think that's why I had some really bad relationships.  A lot of guys prey on girls wanting to be accepted so badly, they'll do almost anything.  I hated who I was, and everything about myself.  So I attracted the types of guys that thought I'd be willing to have sex with them.  i was depressed, not stupid, so those relationships ended.  Then, one day I met the guy I thought I was going to marry.  Things were going awesome, and he loved me for me!!! I ended up royally screwing up that relationship.  So much so that we ended up breaking up and going our separate ways.  So I went through more of life, and it brought me to another man, a man that had same interests as me.  He also dealt with depression, so he knew what I was going through.  He ended up being the man that I married.  Through all of this, my depression lessened, almost subsided, but recently stuff has been happening that has brought my depression back.  I try to hide it, and I do a good job of hiding it.  The reason I hide it is because I have a family now.  I don't just have a husband, but I also have a beautiful daughter who's the joy of my life.  I have to be strong for them.  I have to be strong so I can keep this family together.  It drains me, though.  Knowing that my depression is still lurking in the shadows, waiting for me to get extremely stressed out, waiting for me to trip up so it can rear up its ugly head.  I honestly hope that day never comes.
