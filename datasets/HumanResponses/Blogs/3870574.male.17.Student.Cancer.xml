						     Oscar winning film maker Michael Moore is not patriotic. While talking to Lila Lipscomb in Fahrenheit 9/11, he talks about how great America is. At the end of the movie, he talks about the selflessness of our troops even though early in the movie, Moore makes fun of our young guys playing songs like "Let the Bodies Hit the Floor" in their tanks while they put their life on the line.  To further demonstrate his patriotism, he posts this on his website:  "The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not "insurgents" or "terrorists" or "The Enemy." They are the REVOLUTION, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow -- and they will win."  http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?messageDate=2004-04-14  Some support of our country, Mike.  As for United Nations help?  "There is a lot of talk amongst Bush's opponents that we should turn this war over to the United Nations. Why should the other countries of this world, countries who tried to talk us out of this folly, now have to clean up our mess? I oppose the U.N. or anyone else risking the lives of their citizens to extract us from our debacle. I'm sorry, but the majority of Americans supported this war once it began and, sadly, that majority must now sacrifice their children until enough blood has been let that maybe -- just maybe -- God and the Iraqi people will forgive us in the end. "  It is a sad day in American politics that when your level of political "dissent" reaches as far as predicting and wanting the enemy of our soldiers to win. The worst part? Michael Moore is not off base in the eyes of the Democratic Party and many of their members. Hate our President Mike, but don't hate our troops.

						     I did not what this title be deceptive. The truth is that John Kerry has no vision for America. I challenge anyone reading this post to find his vision. While reading  John Kerry on the Issues  on his personal website, I came across something that is very disturbing.  Let me quote John Kerry's stances on the issues:  John Kerry on the Issues   Economy:  "John Kerry has the courage to roll back Bush’s tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans so we can invest in education and healthcare."   College Affordability:  "While George Bush gives tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans..."  "John Kerry has the courage to take on Bush’s tax cuts for the wealthy so we can invest in education."   Education:  "John Kerry believes that we need to invest in our schools instead of giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans."   Health Care:  "George Bush has chosen to lavish tax cuts upon the wealthiest..."   Homeland Security:  "John Kerry has the courage to roll back George Bush’s tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans so we can invest in homeland security."   National Service:  "Whether it is protecting America from the threats of terrorism or addressing the problems we have at home, America's new challenges will not be met by the same old answers of big government or big tax cuts for the wealthy."  Kerry's vision? The only one that I can see is a promise to raise our taxes and take money out of the pockets of the middle class, working Americans.

						     I'll give some of you some of the reasons why I feel that John Forbes Kerry is bad for America based on my research on him.On key votes, John Kerry has sided with Senator Ted Kennedy 94% of the time.      Kerry has voted against a balanced budget amendment at least five times. Fiscally responsible? Kerry voted against President Bush's tax cuts which Alan Greenspan claimed to have pulled the economy out of the recession. "The first priority is the economy of our nation. And when you have a downturn in the economy, the last thing you do is raise taxes or cut spending. We shouldn't do either We need to maintain a course that hopefully will stimulate the economy...No, we should not raise taxes, but we have to put everything on the table to take a look at why we have this structural problem today... you don't want to raise taxes" (John Kerry on NBC's "Meet The Press," September 2, 2001)       Then, in April 2002, Kerry said he wanted a larger tax cut and was "not in favor of" a repeal. CNN's Tucker Carlson: "Senator Kerry...[many Democrats] [g]et a lot of political mileage out of criticizing [President Bush's tax cut], but nobody has the courage to say repeal it. Are you for repealing it?" Kerry: "It is not a question of courage... And it's not an issues right now. We passed appropriately a tax cut as a stimulus, some $40 billion. Many of us thought it should have even maybe been a little bit larger this last year...[T]he next tax cut doesn't take effect until 2004. If we can grow the economy enough between now and then, if we have sensible policies in place and make good choices, who knows what our choices will be. So it's simply not a ripe issues right now. And I'm not in favor of turning around and repealing it." (CNN's "Crossfire," April 16, 2002)      Eight months later? NBC's Tim Russert: "Senator...should we freeze or roll back the Bush tax cut?" Kerry: "Well, I wouldn't take away from people who've already been given their tax cut...What I would not do is give any new Bush tax cuts..." Russert: "So the tax cut that's scheduled to be implemented in the ocming years...." Kerry: "No new tax cut under the Bush plan...It doesn't make economic sense." Russert: "Now, this is a change, because let me show you what you said in September 2001 when I asked you the very same question." (NBC's "Meet The Press," December 1, 2002)      Kerry claims to want to make this a clean campaign, but in a statement he said on June 19th, 2003, he said that President Bush "misled every one of us." (Ron Fournier, "Kerry Says Bush Mislead Americans On War." The Associated Press, 6/19/03)      Four days days earlier?George Stephanopoulos: "People are really upset that they feel misled by President Bush on this issue of weapons of mass destruction. I know you said you're agnostic about whether or not he misled the public on weapons of mass destruction. But do you have a hunch on whether you think they hyped the intelligence?"John Kerry: "George, again, I think it would be irresponsible of me at this point to draw conclusions prior to all the evidence being on the table. What I know is we have to get that evidence. We have to have an investigation to know to a certainty whether or not it was hype, whether we were misled..." (ABC's "This Week," (6/15/03)        Kerry has voted for at seven major reductions in Defense and Military spending, neccessary for our national security.         In 1996 - Introduced bill to slash Defense Department Funding by $6.5 billion      In 1995 - Voted to feeze defense spending for seven years, slashing over $34 billion from Defense.         Fiscal 1996 Budget Resolution - Defense Freeze. "Harkin, D-Iowa, amendment to freeze defense spending for the next seven years. In 1993 - Introduced plan to cut numerous defense programs, including:          Cut the number of Navy submarines and their crews.      Reduce the number of light infantry units in the Army down to one.      Reduce tactical fighter wings in the Air Force.      Terminate the Navy's coastal mine-hunting ship program.       Force the retirement of no less than 60,000 members of the Armed Forces in one year         Military hardware he felt we nolong need since the "cold war" is past. The money would be better spent on "social" programs. These weapons are now the core of our military might:          The F-16 Fighting Falcons      B-1B's, B-2As, F-15 and F-16s       M1 Abrams      Patriot Missile      AH-64 Apache Helicoptor      Tomahawk Cruise Missile      Aegis Air-Defense Crusier         While running for Congress in 1972, Kerry promised to cut Defense Spending. "On what he'll do if he's elected to Congress," Kerry said he would 'bring a different kind og message to the president." He said he would, "Vote against military appropriations." (Candidate's For Congress Capture Campus in Andover," Lawrence [MA] Eagle-Tribune, 4/21/72)        I leave with this.        "So you can look at all the potential threats of the world, and when you add the expenditures of all our allies to the United States of America, you have to stop and say to yourself, 'What is it that we are really preparing for in a post-cold-war world?"-Senator John Kerry, Congressional Record, 5/15/96, p. S5061)        That makes me feel warm, how about you?

						     I have talked at lengths about why John Kerry is bad for America. I feel compelled that right now I should lay out a case for why the President is better than John Kerry.      Faith      President Bush is a man of great faith. He was a former alcoholic that seeked God to help reform his life. He pulled himself up by the bootstraps with his faith giving him strength. As a Christian, George W. Bush represents the Judeo-Christian values that the majority of Americans hold, and represents the history of what this country was founded on. All though President Bush is a man of faith, he knows the value of being "strong in faith and secular in politics". His faith gives him the strength and moral conviction to do what is right for the country.  With his proposed faith-based initiatives, it gives children to go to community centers where the church is the only place where there is the only safe haven.           Economy:           The economy has been through some tough times.After inheriting an economy that was slumping near the end of the Clinton Adminstration, President Bush was handed the tragedy of the September 11th attacks on our nation, which deeply hurt American businesses and American confidence dramatically. Furthermore, the high-profile corporate scandals of Enron and WorldCom compounded to the problem by weaking confidence in our nations CEO's. Americans were wary of buying stocks of companies in fear that they were "cooking the books".           The President sprung to action and cut the nations taxes so that the money would not be with the government; it would be the with the people that know what is best for that money...the American people.       GDP grew by more than 5 percent over the last three quarters, the fastest rate of growth in nearly two decades.       Productivity grew at the fastest 3-year rate in more than 50 years.       In terms of creating jobs, it could not be any stronger. The tax cuts have put more money in the pockets of our small businesses so that they can buy more equipment and hire more workers.       Since last August, over 1.4 million new jobs have been created.       The unemployment rate has fallen from 6.3 to 5.6 percent, below the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.       This job growth is widespread – employment over the last year was up in 44 of the 50 states, and the unemployment rate was down in 46 of the 50 states.      This job growth is widespread – employment over the last year was up in 44 of the 50 states, and the unemployment rate was down in 46 of the 50 states.      This job growth is widespread – employment over the last year was up in 44 of the 50 states, and the unemployment rate was down in 46 of the 50 states.       Homeland and National Security:      The highest priority of President Bush is to keep Americans safe. He is decisive in his actions. He has the moral clarity to differenciate the difference between good and evil. He has the courage to stand up to dictators, despots, terrorists and tell them that America will respond to attacks on our country and we will take the fight to them. He believes in the philosophy of going after the terrorists before they come here.      He has created many new measures to make it harder for terrorists to attack on the homeland. With the Passage of the USA Patriot Act, inter-agency communication is improved. President Bush has created a number of new agencies that make it faster and easier for our border agents and airport screeners to identify known terrorists.      Furthermore, with the creation of the Homeland Security Department, we now have an agency that is totally focused on preventing and protecting the American homeland from terrorist attacks.       Iraq       President Bush was given a choice. He was to take the word of the CIA to defend America, or take the word of Saddam Hussein. Given that choice, he will defend America every time. With the liberation of Iraq and Afghanistan, 50 million oppressed people now have the taste of freedom.      Even though there is more work to be done in Iraq, we are getting the job done right. President Bush does not believe that running away would be sending the correct message to the terrorists or to the world. America will not waver in the face of terror. We will stand up even when our "allies" will not. Eventually, our strength and resolution will bring them to our side.      We should not have to ask the United Nations, France and Germany permission to defend America.       Our servicemen and women represent the best America has. I deeply thank the brave servicemen that risk their lives so that we will be safe and that the Iraqi people will be free.

						     It is obvious that John Kerry is ashamed of being a liberal today. As the the most liberal Senator in the United States Senate, his voting records tells the American people what he does not want them to know. He stands for higher taxes; against the protection of pregnant women. (Laci Peterson Law) He is for sending our troops to Iraq but against giving them the proper equipment to fight the insurgents in Iraq. He is for the Patriot Act, and now he is against it. Why can't John Kerry tell the truth to the American people on the issues he stands for? Is he embarrassed of his voting record or does he not want to give the American people the whole story?       Secondly, when John Kerry spoke the Democratic National Convention, he was trying to display a more centrist, more moderate viewpoint. Clearly from the reactions in the crowd, the Democratic Party is far from being moderate. They cheered the most when John Kerry made his digs at the President and his cabinet. He pledged that "As president, that is my first pledge to you tonight: as president I will restore trust and credibility to the White House", only to go on to say, "I want to address these next words directly to President Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division"      Furthermore, Kerry goes on to say:      "I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war. I will have a vice president who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws. I will have a secretary of defense who will listen to the best advice of the military leaders. And I will appoint an attorney general who will uphold the Constitution of the United States."          No angry division, Mr. Kerry? How can you, in the course of one speech, flip-flop on your statements? Especially in a speech of this magnitude? The President mislead us into war just as much as you did, Mr. Kerry, and unlike the Senator from Massachusetts, President Bush has a clear and concise view of what he plans to do to protect America. Bush states that he was tired playing defense and he wanted to go on the offensive on these terrorists. (Stated before the 9/11 attacks as chronicled by the 9/11 Commission Final Report.) Bush believes that to defend America we must bog the terrorists by making them move constantly so they cannot plot to murder Americans. President Bush believes that we should not have to get United Nations to get consent to protect our country. President Bush, as did John Edwards did at one point, believed that if we had to defend America without the help with some of our allies, that we will do so.      President Bush is proud of his faith, values and conservatism. John Kerry cannot decide if he is proud to be a liberal. He was a hawk at the beginning of the war. Prior to the re-invention convention, he had to adjust to a more anti-war stance to become the Democrats choice to run for President, and now, at the time where he speaks to the country, he comes to the center and tries to have it both ways. Mr. Kerry, it will not work. The American people see a straight shooter in President Bush. They see you as someone who says what is politically expedient. And in November, it will show as President Bush will have "four more years". For you Mr. Kerry, no "help is on the way".
