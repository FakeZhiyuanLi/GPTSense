      Is it me, or does it seem that family is sometimes impossible to get along with.&nbsp; I have spent the last week (or so) with my family for my grandfather's funeral.&nbsp; Some of the time it's not too bad, but other times it just way too much.&nbsp; My mom acting like I'm still 9 years old, trying to get me to do this or that in the same manner as when I was a kid.&nbsp; My sister trying to mimic what she's doing, but adding a ton of 'tude on top of that.&nbsp; Argh!&nbsp; It just seems too much.&nbsp; I find myself trying to slip back into the person I was when I was in highschool, a person that would just erupt at my family whenever something happened that I didn't like.&nbsp; But I have changed since then, and I don't want to be that person.&nbsp; I find myself reciprocating some of those attitudes, and I just really don't like it.&nbsp; Can I help it?&nbsp; I really don't know.&nbsp; I really want to, but I&nbsp; don't know how sometimes.&nbsp; Add, on top of that, a bunch of family members that try to bait me to conflict with them over matters of faith.&nbsp; How can I overcome this and be a light to them?&nbsp; How can I be the person I know myself to be, and yet deal with the challenges that come from just being a family?&nbsp; I don't know if I will ever find out....   Wow, it never ceases to suprise me how much better I feel after I get something out, even though I may not know to whom I am letting it go.&nbsp; Sometimes life can just get a little overwhelming, but there is always hope.&nbsp; While I have been here with my family, every time I get irritated or annoyed, I step away and just start praying.&nbsp; I pray that I will change, have more patience with my family, that I would learn to love them for who they are, even if they don't live up to the expectations I have for them.&nbsp; Sometimes this is not an easy thing to do.&nbsp; I want them to be something that they may never be...I can never make someone change; rather, change comes from the Father, and I have to be willing to let him do his job.&nbsp; This also is not easily done, I like to interfere when I shouldn't.&nbsp;   On a little lighter note, I have been taking a class through  urlLink VBI , which has been great!&nbsp; It's a class on biblical interpretation.&nbsp; Before I started this course, I would read scripture and be like, "I think this is what it's saying."&nbsp; And it usually was what I really wanted to hear.&nbsp; I have learned how to stop reading it once, then try to figure it out.&nbsp; Rather, I read it, re-read it, and really try to figure out what's going on in the text, like use of repitious phrases and things like that.&nbsp; It is really coold to sit with a passage and relate it to the references of other scripture, and also to the other texts by that author.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; Speaking of which, I have some work I need to get done, so....

      On my mind a lot lately has been my immediate future; primarily how soon I am going to get through school, what school I am going to finish my degree through, and other such things.&nbsp; I really want to finish my degree (something new if anyone knows me), mainly so I can move on to the things that I really want to do.&nbsp; But I am hindered by how I am going to finish that degree: what school will accept me, how I am going to finance it, how long it will take, and how I will pay for rent and other bills.&nbsp; I know I have no chance of getting any academic scholarships, and I have no idea what kind of financial aid I could get (my guess is not enough to really make it possible). &nbsp; The other option is to go VBI.&nbsp; The problem with this is that I might not actually have a degree when I get done with the work.&nbsp; There are some seminaries that are willing to take the work from VBI, and then admit those students for MDiv work, but I would only be marketable to Vineyard churches.&nbsp; Am I going to be in ministry the rest of my life?&nbsp; I would love to say yes, but nothing is written in stone.&nbsp; I know that God has called me into full-time ministry, this has been reaffirmed to me countless times over the last month or so, but it really is a trust issue as to if He will provide me with a job in that are for the rest of my life, and that I shouldn't get educated in another area 'just in case.'&nbsp; Argg!&nbsp; How do I know?&nbsp; It really is a chance to demonstrat great faith...but what if I'm wrong?

       urlLink   So I was on my way home from Church on Sunday, minding my own business, and I almost got in a hug accident!  I was on a two lane road, and there was a slow moving tracker in front of me.  After a little traffic had built up behind me, he pulled over to the shoulder of the road, and signaled for me to go around.  About three cars back a large truck decided he didn't want to wait, and tried to pass all of us (no passing zone) at the same time I was going around the tractor.  He comes barreling up the shoulder, blowing his horn.  We both come up to the same traffic light about 30 seconds later, he's going straight and I'm turning, and he rolls down his window and starts yelling at me about how I'm lucky he has his family with him or he would get out and...well you get the point.  It's always interesting to me that when people are doing something that they're not supposed to do, they get even more angry if something unexpected comes.

      So I have been looking for a job for the last month or so, and as soon as I came back from SOS, I was offered a job at Shar Music Products, working in their call center.  Remember how mom always says not to sit by the phone and wait for someone to call?  Well that's exactly what I do, and I get paid for it too!  It is like the coolest thing ever!  Aside from that, the people that I work with are waky crazy, so I fit in pretty well...Oh!  And there's no uniforms either, so it's come comfortable.  Anyway, yeah, it's pretty neat.

      I am sitting at work yet again, and have nothing to do, so I thought I would add an entry. This morning I met with a friend and we discussed school, and what he's doing to go back and get a degree. We both have a desire to enter ministry, and we both want to get done with our BA's as quickly as possible. It is interesting how the same kind of situation can be solved so differently for different people. He is able to start this year, and will be going to EMU, while I am still looking at where I want to go, and cannot start until Sept '05 at the earliest.  I am a little discouraged by having to wait, but I see things God is doing in my life that necessitate that waiting.  Some of the prayer team members at my church prayed over me a couple weeks ago, and while doing so, Cliff said that he had a sense that I am a jumper, and that God wants to show me how to walk with Him.  That could not have been clearer.  Ever since I can remember, I get excited about things, and I jump right in, not looking back, and not holding anything back.  This usually ends up okay, but I can see the danger ahead if I keep doing that.  So I see that He is showing me right now how to be patient (oh why did I ever pray for patience when I was younger), and that He is going to provide, and going to meet everything I need.   I also see some brokenness from my past that I still need to deal with.  I have learned what is meant by 'baggage' and I know I have a lot.  I definitely want to get rid of some of it, and that's going to take time.  There is some of it I need to be free from before I can move on in life, and I see this time it's going to take me to get back in school, and then to finish school, aiding in that process.  I am very thankful for the people God has brought into my life to help hold me accountable to things, and also to encourage and spur me on toward these goals.

      I am sitting here trying to write a paper for the VBI class I am taking, and it dawns on me that I really have no idea what they are looking for. In the past, while I was actually in the 'traditional' school, I could always figure out what the prof wanted, and be able to regurgitate something he'd said sometime during the semester, and usually do okay with whatever assignment they had me working on. Now, however, I am forced to really think about what is going on, I have no opinion by that person that will be doing the grading, no idea of what is expected. The assignment details are ambigous at best, with no real guidelines for what the assignment should look like, and it leaves me questioning if I should be writting a sermon, or a litterary response. It is at least a little assuring to me to think that no matter what happend with this paper, I have at least learned something through the reading.  However, the question still remains if I will be able to complete a degree at a university that will be grading my academic performance, not just whether I can write about something that I have intermediate knoweldge of with some experience. I have contemplated doing some writting when I get out of school, something of a 'second job,' but that seems so different than what I am currently being asked to do. The assignment is to "comment on four texts [assinged] and so that you've learned something of interpretation." How ambiguous is that? I feel like I am being asked to interpret the scripture and then am being graded on if the person evaluating is judging my interpretation for accurateness. After putting it out, it does make sense. We need someone to check us as we interpret scripture to make sure we're not completely off our rockers (like the snake handlers of WV). So I guess I don't really have a problem with the assignment (other than not knowing what they are really looking for), but it is just difficult. I don't like to be wrong, and in this assignment see a great risk of being told that I didn't quite get it. Chalk this up to a growing experience, dive head in, and see what's going happen.
