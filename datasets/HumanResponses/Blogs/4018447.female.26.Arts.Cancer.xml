      Paul, Riley and I had a nice weekend. Yesterday we went up to Bellevue to see Corey and Dan's new place. It is a big condo in the Renton Highlands. Her parents were over this way so we all went down to the Bellevue Arts and Crafts fair.   While there I completely mastered the art of breastfeeding Riley while walking with her in the sling. I love it! I don't even think anyone really knew what I was doing. Corey's dad even asked if she was sleeping.&nbsp; So cool! I do need a new sling though. I think I am going to make one myself.   Today we all went to church. It was our seminarian, Kahn's, last day. So we went downstairs for doughnuts after mass. Then we came home and Riley was asleep so we did some marathon cleaning.   Robbin stopped by to say hi and reminded me of the heart fabric that she made Riley's curtains out of. (she gave me the excess). So I made Riley some cute pants. They are a little big and long now but she has a lot of room to grow into them.

      YAY! We are refinancing our home! I just finished up my first week as a real time graphic designer too. Working at Trinity Lutheran College is really great. I love the fact that I have my own office. I put in a work order to have it painted and have some extra junk hauled out of there! So I can personalize it as I please.   On another note. I can't stand Keith the Freecycle South King County moderator. He is so annoying! It is like he only owns the group to rule over people to build his own ego it is so annoying.   Paul, Riley and I went to the Lincoln Park wading pool after work today. It got up to 92 degrees today so it was nice to get our feet wet. Riley really likes wading pools. We just walked around with her. Then we went and had dinner at Spuds and walked along Alki.

      Friday the thirteenth! I forget to post for weeks and I remember on friday the thirteenth.   Can I just say I am so sick of people being so against breastfeeding!!! What is wrong with doing something that my body is meant to do? I hate how formula companies have put the idea in people's minds that it is this amazingly great thing. UGH!
