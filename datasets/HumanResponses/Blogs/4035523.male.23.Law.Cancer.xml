          Having a personal website-like just like what I have is as simple as registering to yahoo mail :) go to www.blogger.com, create your own blog (it really becomes yourpersonal website) and start to pour your ideas. It is really as simpleas 1, 2, 3 steps :))   Remember, it is just like creating a new acount in Yahoo :)) I thinkit will be easy to follow the 'wizard' in creating a blog.btw, People, usually call the blog as an online diary. Someday, blogwill become an amazing phenomenon, just like e-mail nowadays. peoplewill no more ask only your email, but also your blog when you meet newguys. Instead of just saying 'send me an email' you will also say,"drop by my blong and leave your message there" :) Isn's it cool huh?   give a try , it's fun and 'great' :)
