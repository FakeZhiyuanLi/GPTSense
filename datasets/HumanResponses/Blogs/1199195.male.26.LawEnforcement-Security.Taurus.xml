          A bee, doing bee things. Took this on that same trip to Los Angeles as the city shot in the previous entry.   I'm having a litle issue lately where I put things on the roofs of cars, only to forget them and have them fall off and smash or fly off into oblivion while driving. How, you ask, can one put something on the roof of a car and forget about it in the scant seconds it takes to get in? Your guess is as good as mine. I'm now on cell phone number 3 on account of this flaw. Several years ago, my gf and I were contemplating getting cell phones. I told her she didn't need one, that she'd just lose it. I know I told her that because I've heard it every day since I lost the last phone. lol. I'm pretty sure it was a victim of the roof, but I can't say for certain. About a week ago I was at an accident and when I was getting back into the car I put some things on the roof as my hands were full. I then went ahead and drove off, phone still on the roof, wondering where it could possibly be. I feared the roof had claimed it, so I drove back to the spot where I'd been parked, and just as I turned into the parking lot, off it flew, my precious phone. It got wedged between the roof and the lights, which had cradled it gently until I turned the corner.   About a week after that, hands full once again while climbing into a car at work, I put a PBT (portable breath test) on the roof and drove away. It went flying off at about 40mph, crashing to the ground, case flying open, batteries and parts everywhere. lol. This was bad, cos it wasn't even my stuff on the roof. It was a 200 dollar device that belonged to my employer. So, doing what any guy would do, I jammed the batteries back in, duct taped it up, and off I went. It still turned on, but being that I wasn't boozed up, I had no way of determining if it still worked. I intended to leave a note or something about breaking it, but forgot about the whole thing until a day or two later when my supervisor called and asked if I'd smashed it up. Oh yeah, PS, I broke it. He was trying to use it on someone and didn't seem pleased. lol. Oh well.  So, the roof seems to have claimed my cell phone too, which isn't so bad because my dad has 2, and he gave me his Nextel to replace mine, cos he never uses is, but what a pain in the nuts it is not having any numbers in it. I had about 140 direct connect numbers in there, plus a ton of regular phone numbers too. Now when I get to work every day, I have to re-store everyone that I'm going to be working with. It has the same phone numbers assigned to it, so that's a plus. Anyway, the roof. Watch that shit. It'll claim a phone or other pricey electronic device like *that*.   Want to hear something strange and random? The very next night after that gun incident in the previous entry, I was on a traffic stop at my other department, where I'd pulled a car full of hoofties in a no-passing zone and was talking to them. I had 2 other officers there w/me cos there were 5 of them in the car, all moving around and reaching under the seats and whatnot when I first pulled up. Anyway, as I was talking to them, one of them asked me, "Officer, can I go get a smoke off my sister? She's right behind your cars." There were 3 of our cars there, and I hadn't even noticed that someone had pulled up behind the last one. I said no and told him to stay there, and walked back to the car that had pulled up. The driver looked kind of familiar, and I asked him his name. When he said it, I realized it was the guy from the day before, one of the two who went into the bathroom to ditch the gun. Oddly, he was following that first car, they were all going somewhere together, and I happened to be right there at that time to see them passing where they weren't supposed to.   Being that there was a stolen handgun in the car the day before, as soon as he said his name, I drew my weapon and got everybody out of the car. There was nothing on them or in the car itself, but I was able to talk to the guy and get some information on who was in the car the day before. How random was that though? I was only on that shift because I switched with someone else. And then for me to be right there, in that one spot, at that very moment. Very random, very random.

      My old journal site (In The Wire) is apparently dead, which brings me here. Maybe another time I'll explain what this is all about, but in the mean time, I'm just going to pick up right where I left off, with an entry I meant to post the other day. First, a random picture from my  site , a shot of downtown Los Angeles from the Disney Concert hall.        Today was pretty interesting. A couple of firsts for me. One, I spooked some thugs who dumped a stolen pistol, which I recovered, and two, I arrested a husband and wife simultaneously. And for the second time in my career, I was referred to as "Dick Tracy" by a drunk guy (the husband), this time for an on-view arrest I made when I found him urinating all over a car in the middle of a restaurant's parking lot. lol. Thank you. *bowing* Thank you. Yes, it's true, my detective skillz are off tha chain.   The first thing though, this was a little unsettling. I was driving through a big shopping center, your typical Old Navy/Michaels/Bed Bath & Beyond/Best Buy/Staples, etc., when I saw a blue car parked a ways out in the lot with a guy squatting at the passenger side door, doing something to the lock. I rolled over that way, and saw 2 other guys in a red car right next to it with a female driver. He walked into Old Navy, and the red car drove over about 6 rows and parked. About 10 minutes later, he walked out of Old Navy, back to where the blue car was and started looking around, like he didn't know the red car had moved. He spotted it, and walked over and also got in. The 4 of them sat there for about 30 minutes, and just to see these people made me suspicious, cos they weren't exactly dressed like they shopped at Old Navy, i.e. they looked pretty gangsta, and they were just sitting in the car. Plus, I've seen it enough times to know when someone's waiting for me to leave. I contemplated going up to talk to them, but didn't.  Anyway, after 30 minutes, the girl got out and I saw she was in a Best Buy uniform, leaning into the window talking to the 3 gangbangers. Then the rest of them got out, and they all went into Best Buy, but before she did this, she put on the 4-way flashers. In a parking spot. I went over on the sly and saw that the keys were out and it was unlocked, but didn't see anything of interest from the outside. After maybe 15 minutes, the guys walked out and got into the blue car they were originally in, which again made me even more suspicious, because what was up w/all the car-switching? They drove off, and I thought the girl was still in the store, so I had someone else come up and sit on the car so I didn't lose it, and I went into the store to talk to this employee. The manager said the girl had been off work for about an hour, and did just come in w/the 3 thugs, one of which was her husband (according to her). Someone said she was in the breakroom and went to check, but said she was gone, and had left the building but not through the front door, which was highly unusual. Hmm. I got her info from the manager and went back outside. I waited about 20 minutes to see if she'd come back. Then a call came over the radio that Best Buy had located a loaded handgun in their men's room. Hmm. I was still there, so I went, and sure enough, an employee had pulled a paper towel out of the holder in the men's room and out fell this .22 LR handgun, one in the pipe, hammer cocked. Instead of not touching it, some Best Buy genius who was in the military took the liberty of unloading it for me, not by removing the magazine, but by racking the slide and chambering every round until it was empty, thus getting his fingerprints all over the gun. Luckily, he hadn't been able to figure out how to drop the magazine, which means the last person to touch the mag is the person who inserted it into the gun, so there's a chance for prints there.   They reviewed tape from a camera right outside the men's, and sure enough there was thug nation, one of them keeping a watch while the other went in to ditch the heater. Turns out the gun was stolen. The suspect was the owner's son, who told his dad he sold it to a black female for drugs. In an odd twist, this guy hung himself 2 weeks ago, so he won't be telling me anything useful. I collected this up and went back outside to find the car still there, flashing away. Now obviously the 2 are related, the car and this guy w/the gun, so I decided to look in the car for any useful info, i.e. names, etc. Apparently the girl uses 3 last names and is renting a U-Haul next week for something. I took some random phone numbers written on slips of paper with just an initial next to it, or just a first name, or a nickname or whatever, along w/something that showed her current address. I wasn't sure I'd be able to wait until someone came back for the car, but I didn't want to miss it, being that we were dealing with people who bring loaded stolen guns into Best Buy. That was the odd part of it. All these Saturday afternoon shoppers, fancy people in SUVs buying trendy stuff at Old Navy, moms and kids, and here I'm playing this cat-and-mouse game with people who were (unbeknownst to me) armed. That's part of what I love about the job though; How it all goes down on the sly right under that surface layer of what's "normal". You know, they're buying Old Navy ringer T's for 3 for 10 bucks, and then there's me in the same place, with this hinky business going on in the lot.   Anyway, I didn't want to miss whoever came back for the car because I really didn't appreciate that shit. I go to that Best Buy. My gf and family go to that Old Navy, and I don't want gangbangers thinking they can mix around with normal people and go about their business in there like that. So, I thought about it for a few minutes and while I was at the red car, I pulled 2 fuses from under the dash, one that disabled most of the rear lights and one for the left headlight, almost ensuring the car would get pulled over if anyone tried to move it, I would overhear it on the radio, and be able to tell that officer to detain the occupants. *shrugs* I don't know. Think what you will on that. It seemed right at the time, and I'm still comfortable with it now. It's not something I do every day, and I'm talking about people who carry stolen handguns in a place like somewhere you regularly shop yourself or with your family.   Then as I'm out there, another call came over the radio that Best Buy has more info, so I went back in. The girl apparently called and said that they "might" find a gun in the bathroom, and that the person who put it there was sending someone to pick it up. The manager was talking to her as I stood there. I wrote him 2 notes. One, "Don't tell her I'm here", and two, "Try to get them to come back." He played the whole thing down like everything was ok, just come back, get the car and stuff, etc. He said she said she was on the way back up for the car. So, another 20 minutes or so of sitting in the lot, and the girl came back, driven by her parents (who I later found out had a dead tag on their Buick that was on a Honda years ago, but that's neither here nor there). The girl said that the owner of the blue car, the registration of which I'd luckily written down earlier, was her friend, and she didn't know the other 2, but one of them had the gun.   As they sat in her car, the 2 she didn't know started arguing because they were concerned that I would stop them, being that I was obvisouly watching them. She stated that the one w/the gun made a comment that if I stopped him, it would be his second gun charge. I'm actually of the opinion that the owner of the other car is her boyfriend, although she's actually married to someone else, which is why she told the employees he was her husband, cos he's always there when she's at work. So she's whacking this black guy, the thug gangster, while her husband sits at home in the trailer park they live in. The owner of the blue car, the boyfriend, has 17 pages of drug and gun charges, fleeing and eluding, resisting arrest, aggravated assault, removing VINs from a car so it couldn't be traced, carrying a gun w/out a permit, carrying a gun as a convicted felon, etc. Nice guy. I think it was actually him w/the gat, cos he's no stranger to all this, and for not knowing anything or any one, she knew an awful lot. I would have loved to have stopped them and caught someone with it, but honestly I'm sort of glad I didn't go up to the car. A .22 LR can go right through a vest because the round is small and some travel at an incredible velocity that would tear right through.   Anyway, she said she'd get back to me if she could figure out the guy's name. I won't hold my breath. The manager said these guys are always there when she's there, so I'm sure I'll see them around. The next thing is to send the gun to the State Police crime lab, which conveniently is aout 10 minutes from our station, where they'll not only process it for fingerprints, but also fire it and do a ballistics test to see if it's been used as a murder weapon and possibly match up the bullet with bullets found in a body or what have you. Apparently that info gets entered into some national computer system where it can be matched up with recovered bullets from another crime if it's been used. I thought that was pretty cool. So, apparently I had the block a little too hot for them and they dumped the piece. Better than them keeping it, I guess.   As far as the husband and wife tandem drunk duo, I was driving behind a restaurant at around 1030pm, when I saw a car pull to a stop, and a guy get out and start peeing on a car as I drove by. I smiled, and did a u-turn. Thankfully he'd turned away by the time I walked up so I wouldn't have his junk staring me in the face. "How's it goin?" I asked. He said he was fine. I asked what he was doing peeing on a car in a parking lot, and he said, "Pissing. This is America. Is it against the law to piss?" lol. I'll tell ya what, I love a drunk with an attitude. They generally end up in the back of my car faster than me ordering up a cheesesteak on the Sheetz touch-screen. He yelled about his rights for a few minutes and got back into the car. His wife was driving, and there was an empty beer can in the back seat. When I asked how many he had, he said 5. When I asked her, she said 3 at the same time that he said "none". I had her come out of the car and talk to me. She said he'd had 12 or 15, and she'd had a "few more" than 3. I ran her through some field sobriety tests, which she failed, and I hooked her up for DUI. She told me that I would be "shocked" when we got to the DUI center because she wasn't drunk. She later blew a .147, which isn't astronomical, but she was definitely drunk. A-screw you, lady. Before we left she said, "I want my keys, but DON'T go in my purse!" I looked in the bag, being that it was hers and she was being arrested, but didn't see anything, however I was rather suspicious.   Her husband decided to get out on his own and yell at me some more about how this was America, how the laws of nature (i.e. urinating) were above the laws of man (i.e. don't pee in the parking lot), how I pissed, how my partner pissed, how God pissed. I took him into custody, at which time he went on to say that he was going to tell the judge that he wasn't the only one who pissed. That I did it, that the judge did it. Yeah. Thank you, doctor. What a dildo. I told him he had a pretty open & shut case against me. lol. He then congratulated me on being a hero for arresting him, which I thanked him for. Always nice to get a compliment. At the station he went on to shoot his mouth off more at me, and at my partner, whose name he kept severely mispronouncing, which seemed highly amusing at the time. After a while I just referred to him as the wrong name too. lol. Somehow it went from being an Italian name to a French name. Drunk people do this a lot. They'll come to the office sober to complain that they didn't receive a warm welcome, and say a name of someone who doesn't even work there. lol.   Anyway, he got tough right before I took him home and stood up and asked me what else I wanted to charge him with. I said, "I don't know, what else would you like to be charged with?" "Well  YOU'RE  the law, you tell me", he replied. I said, "Pal, until they make being an asshole illegal, I can't charge you for that. My hands are tied. *shrugs*" lol. He didn't seem to appreciate that. When we dropped him off, he got to his porch, and exercising another one of his God-given rights, the right to do whatever you want on your own property (which does not exist), flipped us off and said "fuck" about 60 times. As he fished around his wife's purse for the keys, a roach fell out onto the porch, which I picked up. Normally I don't bother with weed, but he was such a dick. He yelled "fuck you" some more, and my partner made kissy noises at him as I wished him "sweet dreams" and waved. lol. And to think they pay me for this.   I then had the pleasure of taking his wife for an intoxylizer test, where she persisted at being a bitch and telling me how stupid I, along with the rest of my department was, how I was a little kid, how I was not a man. I'm pretty good at back-and-forth drunk banter, so eventually she shut up. On the way out she kept saying, "I don't want you to touch me", even though I wasn't. Finally I just told her, "Honey, your skanky ass is the last thing I want to touch." She shut up after that, got in the car and looked out the window. I don't know why I get so nasty w/people sometimes. Well, I do. You can only handle someone talking shit to you for about an hour straight before you start saying things back. So, it's good times as usual. Sweet dreams, kids. *kissy noises*
