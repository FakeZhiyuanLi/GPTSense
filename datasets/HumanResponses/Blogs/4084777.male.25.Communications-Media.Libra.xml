      Yes, I am a Bengali, I know... But I found this on the interweb and it is really funny, I'm posting it here as well. Damn amazingly written!  "The Travails of Single South Indian men of conservative upbringing" or "Why we don't get any..."   Yet another action packed weekend in Mumbai, full of fun, frolic and introspection. I have learnt many things. For example having money when none of your friends have any is as good as not having any. And after spending  much time in movie theatres, cafes and restaurants I have gathered many insights into the endless monotony that is the love life of south Indian men. What I have unearthed is most disheartening. Disheartening because comprehension of these truths will not change our status anytime soon. However there is also cause for joy. We never stood a chance anyway. What loads the dice against virile, gallant, well educated, good looking, sincere mallus and tams? (Kandus were once among us, but Bangalore has changed all that.)  Our futures are shot to hell as soon as our parents bestow upon us names that are anything but alluring. I cannot imagine a more foolproof way of making sure the child remains single till classified advertisements or that maternal uncle in San Francisco thinks otherwise. Name him "Parthasarathy Venkatachalapthy" and his inherent capability to combat celibacy is obliterated before he could even talk. He will grow to be known as Partha. Before he knows, his smart, seductively named northy classmates start calling him Paratha. No woman in their right minds will go anyway near poor Parthasarathy. His investment banking job doesn't help either. His employer loves him though. He has no personal life you see. By this time the Sanjay Singhs and Bobby Khans from  his class have small businesses of their own and spend 60% of their lives in discos and pubs. The remaining 40% is spent coochicooing with leather and denim clad muses in their penthouse flats on Nepean Sea Road. Business is safely in the hands of the Mallu manager. After all with a name like Blossom Babykutty he cant use his 30000 salary anywhere. Blossom gave up on society when in school they automatically enrolled him for Cookery Classes. Along with all the girls.  Yes my dear reader, nomenclature is the first nail in a coffin of neglect and hormonal pandemonium. In a kinder world they would just name the poor southern male child and throw him off the balcony. "Yes appa we have named him Goundamani..." THUD. Life would have been less kinder to him anyway.If all the women the Upadhyays, Kumars, Pintos and, god forbid, the Sens and Roys in the world have met were distributed amongst the Arunkumars, Vadukuts and Chandramogans we would all be merry casanovas with 3 to 4 pretty things at each arm. But alas it is not to be. Of course the south Indian women have no such issues. They have names which are like sweet poetry to the ravenous northie hormone tanks. Picture this: "Welcome, and this is my family. This is my daughter Poorni (what a sweet name!!) and my son Ponnalagusamy (er.. hello..).." Cyanide would not be fast enough for poor Samy. Nothing Samy does will help him. He can pump iron, drive fast cars and wear snazzy clothes, but against a braindead dude called Arjun Singhania he has as much chance of getting any as a Benedictine Monk in a Saharan Seminary.  Couple this with the other failures that have plagued our existence. Any attempt at spiking hair with gel fails miserably. In an hour I have a crown of greasy, smelly fibrous mush. My night ends there. However the northy just  has to scream "Wakaw!!!" and you have to peel the women off him to let him breathe. In a disco while we can manage the medium hip shake with neck  curls, once the Bhangra starts pumping we are as fluid as cement and gravel in a mixer. Karan Kapoor or Jatin Thapar in the low cut jeans with chaddi strap showing and  see through shirt throws his elbows perfectly, the cynosure of all attention.  The women love a man who digs pasta and fondue. But why do they not see the  simple pleasures of curd rice and coconut chutney? When poor Senthilnathan opens his tiffin box in the office lunch room his female coworkers just dissappear  when they see the tamarind rice and poppadums. The have all rematerialised around Bobby Singh who has ordered in Pizza and Garlic bread. (And they have the gall to talk of foreign origin.)  How can a man like me brought up in roomy lungis and oversized polyester shirts ever walk the walk in painted on jeans (that makes a big impression)  and neon yellow rib hugging t shirts? All I can do is don my worn "comfort fit" jeans and floral shirt. Which is pretty low on the "Look at me lady" scale, just above fig leaf skirt and feather headgear a la caveman, and a mite below Khakhi Shirt over a red t shirt and baggy khakhi pants and white trainers a  la Rajni in "Badsha".  Sociologically too the tam or mallu man is severely sidelined. An average tam stud stays in a house with, on average, three grandparents, three sets of uncles and aunts, and over 10 children. Not the ideal atmosphere for some intimacy and some full throated "WHOSE YOUR DADDY!!!" at the 3 in the  morning. The mallu guy of course is almost always in the gulf working alone on some onshore oil rig in the desert. Rheumatic elbows me thinks.  Alas dear friends we are not just meant to set the nights on fire. We are just not built to be "The Ladies Man". The black man has hip hop, the white man  has rock, the southie guy only has idlis and tomato rasam or an NRI account in South Indian Bank Ernakulam Branch. Alas as our destiny was determined in one fell swoop by our nomenclature, so will our future be. A nice arranged  little love story. But the agony of course does not end there. On the first night,  as the stud sits on his bed finally within touching distance and whispers his sweet desires into her delectable ear, she blushes, turns around and  whispers back "But amma has said only on second saturdays..."

      Why the hell does my life go through crisis situations every second day. Everything is a crisis for me. Friends, family, job, sex (or no sex) and god knows what else. I just work myself up into states of utter paranoia until I can get my hands on a drink of some sort. Now there is this issue with a job!  Really, I should not publicise this across the world, but after I sent a phone out with a billion and one private messages, who cares about this. Basically put, I have a potential job offer, in fact two.  But, the crisis is that I am very happy with my current job. Do I need a new job? No, I do not, but I would be stupid to turn the job down. The first offer is one from TV which I will not take up. Why? I don't like TV as a medium, heck I love writing and I guess it is something I am rather good at, or so I think. The second one is where the confusion sets in. The offer, (but it is not on paper as yet, so I should not get too far ahead of myself) is to finally free myself from business reporting and get into political journalism. This is what I guess I was destined for, and what I must do. Political Journalism is where it is at, and magazines, fun as they might be is not what I really want to do in the long term.  I want back in a daily.  I spent two long and painful years, (yes, they were rewarding at another level) at the Hindustan Times. But, I loved being in the loop all the time, following the news, running around, getting pages made, that was fun. Ok, I really did not like the 50-days without a break job (I worked seven Sundays in a row) but then again I was sent off to Germany on an awesome junket and went to China twice. That was really good fun. Of course, I was a Buiness Reporter then as well, and now I want a change. I started as a Business Reporter because both CS and ASG started as political reporters, and now CS is half (maybe 75%) a politician himself. Yes, maybe politicing is something I have even considered for the long-term. This country could use someone like me, or so I think. Business reportage is fun, but it isn't the scene. I mean, what power does some silly double-MBA CEO of some company sitting out in Gurgaon really have on the country's future. Whereas some criminal eighth-pass Member of Parliament sitting in jail in Bihar could make or break the government. Ironic isn't it. And these guys are far more colourful - no golf but shooting protected wildlife or maybe some members of some other caste, thats their game. Not that I want to do any of that. I want to change that. We need to progress from being a tribal society who go around killing each other to a progressive one. And maybe I can do that. But that is still a long way away. But if that stupid dream in the sky has to have any chance of coming to fruition I have to change jobs now. And there is the problem. I like my current job, my bosses are really nice and honest, unlike previous bosses I have worked with. The job is easy, but gets me to work hard. I have learnt to write better and reasearch more.  Do I need to change? Should I change now or later? Ihave no clue. I need to work this one out a bit more. Lets see, tomorrow is when I meet the guy for the job, lets see how it goes.

      There was this woman in my life. Lets call her 'The Bitch' - I don't want to get into any further trouble. I loved her, no actually I was infatuated to the point of obssession with her. I had my heart out in my hand and this woman crushed it. I was used and abused and god knows what else. But in a weird sort of way, and I am not being masochistic here, I deserved it.  I needed a lesson about women and how they can be. And the ones I should avoid. Its not as if I have not been in love before her or for that matter since. Why does she still play on my mind. I think it is because she called me yesterday. In fact, I hate the bitch from the bottom of my heart, but I will not be vindictive, even though I guess I can. Am I over her? I guess. Putting down my thoughts for everyone to read, and not under any illusions to who I am, heck that helps. I guess. Anyway, this is off my chest now, and I need to move on and I have moved on. There is someone else I love, but of course there are committment issues on my side. So lets see where the hell I end up in six months time....

      "To committ or not to committ?" Man, Hamlet just had to decide whether to be or not - well there was Ophelia - but his is the ultimate existential question. Mine is a bit more real life.  Simple, cutting out the crap. There is this woman who I really like, love even, and I do not want to lose her to some other guy. So far, so good. But her parents want her to get married. Now she is not the type of girl to say no to Mummy and Daddy - so I am the one who has to make a call. "But I don't wanna get married." No I don't. I love her, but I do not think that I am ready for marriage. I don't earn enough and the very idea of marriage is too hairy. My parents marriage broke down. My friend Bobby saw his seven year relationship and subsequent engagement break. Teevee Superstar, my buddy, big-time TV anchor saw his wife dump him (but, knowing her that was coming ten miles away) and my current boss is on his THIRD marriage and he is all of 45. True, five of six instances don't make for the norm, but, man these blowouts happened to people I know rather well. Heck, it happened to the people who concieved me. So, do I love her enough to marry her? Yes, I do, but not today or tomorrow. Maybe, when I am 28 or 29 but not now. But, will I become old all by myself if I don't decide anything now, well, thats a risk I just have to take. I won't do what ASG (my step-dad) did and marry a readymade family when he is 45 (bless him!), but I will get married to a woman I love, maybe. Or I could do the Indian thing and ask Mom to find me someone.  About this girl. Well, I am resigned to losing her, and anyway we are much too close friends to get married. But, the one thing I have learnt is to never say never. Lets see what happens tomorrow.

      Kind of strange why I started doing LSD.  Lysergic Acid Di-ethylamide also known as 'acid'. But you folks aren't stupid, eh, you know all about that I guess. In case you do want want to know more - you should check out this website - www.erowid.org - detailed info about all sorts of psychedelia. Anyway, back to the point. I was around 21 when I dropped my first ever stamp. I was never forced to do it. I thought and I thought again before I dropped. But having been brought up on a steady diet of 60's and 70's rock and roll - music influenced by LSD - I thought that I would understand where the music was coming from if I dropped acid.  But, I was listening to hardcore psychedelic trance at the time. I popped my first ever trip at my friend Hairy D's (well he does have hair sprouting from his houlders) place. His (then) girlfriend and another friend (lets see what can I call him without being sued, nothing actually, so I'll just use initials) VS were there as well. If I remember correctly, I must have done one-third of a stamp called 'Hoffmann'. The stamp was named after Albert Hoffmann, the Swiss pharmacist who accidentally discovered the drug and on a package of 5x5 stamps you had a cartoon of Dr Hoffmann trying to ride his cycle home after becoming the first person to consume the substance.  What he had done that day was about 25-50 times more than what I had just done, yet the images in my head were spectacular. Of course, like an idiot the next day I thought that LSD is no big deal and decided to go to work. Some idiot was playing 'Backstreet Boys' or something else pretty loudly in office (it was a rather empty day) and I freaked out. Therein lay the rub. There were not too many people I could have spoken to. Mobile phones were still rather expensive, and I didn't have one, so forget my friends. I couldn't have spoken to family and everyone else of my friends were sleeping. Not good. Anyway, thanks to rather fortuious circumstances I survived without jumping off the the building - I guess that was because I worked in the basement. Anyway, that was my first trip. There were several more to follow. The reason I am writing this is because I recently had my nth trip. I even lost count. But I did it yesterday after six months and the time before that was on New Years. Before that I had quit acid for over a year, sticking only to cocaine. Now that is having expensive tastes. But after that first trip, I started doing this substance at a frantic pace. In the six months that followed I was doing acid every second weekend, if not every weekend. It was fun, a small little stamp and you were flying, seeing the music make shapes in your head and having surreal out-of-body experiences.  Then there was Goa 2000-01. Those eight-nine days could fill up a 300-page non-fiction book. That is if I remember anything. Every night my body was fuelled by a manic cocktail of LSD, Ecstasy and god knows what else. I was processing so many chemicals thre were times my brain used to forget where the hell I was. I used to wake up in the morning next to strange people, that is if I ever slept. There was a party on the morning of the first. All I remember is going to that party after a nice lunch and then popping some pill called 'Euro'. HD walked up to me after I had popped and told me that I should have only done half because it was very strong - but it was way too late. Boom! I have no recollection of the next five-six hours. The first memory I have of that day is some seven hours later when I was talking to Mr Sood. That time was a blast.  I kind of slowed down a bit after that. I knew that since I had a regular job and that getting busted would have meant too many red faces, it was too dangerous to continue. But, that was just slowing down. I did end up doing all sorts of drugs after that - Keta, Smack and I almost shot myself up with Heroin. Of course, the smoking was on before acid and never really did slow down even after I took it easy on the other substances. Substance Abuse? No. Drugs made me happy for the moment, and frankly they are mis-understood. Yes, anything in excess is bad, but by keeping them illegal what purpose do you serve. Don't kids want to do drugs more because they're illegal? Hey, thats why I started smoking marijuana.  Anyway, my tirade for legalisation will come later. My last acid trip was like a reintroduction to the stuff. I think I ended up doing a rather large dose because the guy who gave us the stuff was tripping so hard. My friend who took us there sindhi dude was tripping so hard, and he had to DJ. If we were sober his DJ session would have been termed a joke or worse, but this time I had no bloody clue what the hell was going on. Those were a kick-ass six to seven hours. The dirve back in the morning was hilarious because I had no idea where the hell I going and somehow we ended up at the flower market in Mehrauli trying to work out what the hell was going on. Anyway, thats enough for now. I had fun with LSD - I don't condone drug use - but its not as screwed up as the government makes it out to be.

      Here I am sitting at Avantika's house sitting getting bored. Avatika meanwhile is having a three-way conversation with the Vedu's (ver 2.1 and 2.2) and talking about 'killing people'. People on painkillers sometimes have no idea what the frigg they are talking about.  I'll leave the more philosophical ones for later.  And her course is over and its her birthday in two days.

      Yes, the rains have finally after one month of waiting finally cast the sun out of the lives of us Delhi-ites for some time at least. OK, I know my grammar makes no sense over here - but hear me out anyway. I was coming back from the Oberoi today and it took me one and a half friggin' hours. OK, 75 minutes but that is still way too long for a ride that should take 20-25 minutes at the most.  Delhi sort of seems to slow down dramatically when it rains, unlike Bombay it does not shut down, but the slow-down is rather bad in itself. It might as well shut-down for all I care. And it is not as if the authorities did not know about the chaos. They had a whole month more to prepare. And they still screwed up. The Panchukian Road and Mandir Marg crossing is a holy mess, with one foot deep water making it nearly impassable. Bajaj Auto have made a lot of money from duping auto-rickshaw wallahs (who in turn dupe us, the consumers) but they have never ever put any money back into R&D on the three wheeler. Three inches of water and the scooter stalls, and guess who gets wet. I love the rains when I am home, not when I am travelling.  This is just a rant I needed to get rid off.

      Gwenyth Paltrow and Huey Lewis sag  Cruisin'  a rather mellow and nice romantic duet. However, getting to the point, last night I got a very strange message from a friend (or so-called friend) who accused me of bitching about her. Whats very strange, is that though I am a Grade-A bitch, I do it rather 0openly, and remember about it. This one totally caught me off guard. It is not as if I was caught in the act, the problem is that I never did or said anything about this chick even though I now believe I had ample reason to. There is a limit to being muddle-headed - believing what other people tell you without doing even a cursory check to see if that is true is not being a good journalist, or a non-idiotic human being for that matter. Heck, hunbdreds of people have started rumours about me, I have usually gone to the source and asked them about it. If they squirm and shuffle, then well, they did say something - if it was said in vindictiveness or with malice intended - then there is nothing much I can do. However, and here is where this incident is weird - this time I think someone has said stuff to piss someone off against me. I bitch about generalities - there are very very few people I bitch about. OK - so I make the comment that TeeVee Superstar can be stuffy at times, Boss can be pompous (there I said it), Vedu 2.1 is plain weird, and so on. Come to think of it, what this girl is even accusing me off is banality. Anyway, this being a truly 'WTF?' moment in my life, I still am working out where on hell that message came from last night. Anyway, if the person involved bothers to read this - then chill out. I never said anything, so chill.  Edited : Aug 03 1803  I finally persuaded a common friend to speak to the person who accused me of the above heinous crime. Well, it turns outthat 'The Bitch' (read below) had gotten to her as well. Now, I am not being vindictive, and this poor girl is being torn apart by two different people, but at least she should have heard me out first. Anyway, alls well that ends well. Thanks a ton to 'common friend'. I guess she will see the irony in this whenever she reads this. But, I hope that is not the ending I wish for 'The Bitch'. Now, I want to go with daggers drawn and all, and this woman is asking for trouble, but I will desist. My revenge will not be taken by me, but by other forces. Life has other means of settling things down - Entropy continues to increase but the amount of energy in the universe is always constant. Until you play with quantum mechanics and anti-matter and all that stuff - but the amount of matter will still always remain more or less constant - I think!  Or so the now chastened Stephen hawking is saying!

      I have rather lucky when it comes to car crashes. Given the amount of times I have driven with huge amounts of alcohol or other narcotics in my system - I should very honestly be dead. But, I guess my training and just sheer experience has helped me. OK, I should not talk too soon. I've had the occasion fender-bender and body scratch. But being in India, getting the quick paint-job or repair is very cheap. My mom's old Maruti 800 went through a lot of trauma, but I was a young hardly experienced driver then. I once fell asleep at the wheel and hit the central verge. Then there was a tractor that reversed into me. Damage, too much damage. But, the two times I ever came close to death were both rather scary incidents. The first time was when I was with my friend Bobby on the way to Manali. We had just left Delhi and were at the twon of Sonepat going at a fairly rapid clip. Suddenly a truck decides to reverse straight into the path of Bob's Honda City, quick swerve onto the central verge and i thought we were goners. Thankfully, nothing happened to either the car or to the passengers, but the front left tyre which took the entire load of the accident was busted. Bobby of course, has gone on to have several other incidents - This brings up the major issue of him being a decent driver. But, thats just Bobby. Now, the other time, I almost killed three other people. Maithreyee (then of FE now of CNBC), Bijoy Kumar Y (BS Motoring) and Dilip Moitra (Deccen Herald). Driving an Accent CRDi, which a bloody good car, from Mumbai to Goa, I was having a jolly good time on the road just outside Chiplun. This was the summer of 2002, if I am correct. Twisty, good road was just meant for me, the car was squealing with delight everytime I threw it into a turn. This had one major downside - I got bloody overconfident.  So coming into a sharp 90-degree righthander I threw the car into the turn at a rather stupid 80k's. This meant that I had major understeer, which is a problem with the Accent, but the tyres had been grippy earlier, just now they gave up. The front left tyre struck gravel and lost all traction - the car pivoted on that tyre, pulled a neat 180, as I was desperately trying to control steering, hands gripping the wheel tightly and pumping the brakes like a man possessed. I was shitting bricks. Anyway, I'm alive and guilt-free as I write this. The only damage sustained was a cracked sidewall on the tyre (and my ego). Maithreyee - if I remember correctly went kinda like "Lets do this again!" I couldn't talk or drive for the next ten minutes. But Bijoy made sure that I did to get my confidence back. Dilip on the other hand kept on saying rather nasty things - I never responded - but I joined BT I found out that he was asked to leave BT in rather acrimonious circumstances. I was not too surprised. Since then, there have never been any major experiences - touchwood. I am a bit more careful on the road, but I am a rather good driver if I say so myself. Anyway I just had to share this - before the tale becomes more romantic!

      I passed out for 15 hours last night. FIFTEEN HOURS!!!! What is wrong with me? I'm growing old, very old. OK, there was a tremendous amount of undigested alcohol inside me and the wine I drank that afternoon plus the joint with friends when we were watching the Sri lankan's whip India all over the field in the match.  Thank God I fell asleep though. I couldn't have watched India choke [AGAIN!!!] in a major tournament final. End result of this tournament - we lost more than we won. We even lost to Pakistan - so what was the point. Talking about Pakistanis - Javed Miandad is being made into a hero over here. Why I have no idea, but Zee News has decided to get him here for some obscure marketing purpose. That guy hates Indians from the bottom of his heart. Why bring him to India? Read Suhel Seth's column in the Asian Age today and hurt as it might admitting to the fact that it was good, it really was good. Anyway - I am still too zoned out to write anything of any sense, so I'll take your leave.

      Last night was TeeVee Superstar's 30th birthday - well there were no strippers coming out of birthday cakes and all given that we are all respectable journalists and all. Plus there were some cute chicks there as well. Anyway, frighteningly for me, my (very hairy!) boobs were the star of the show - that stupid home video of our escapades in Italia - starring US and a almost naked me (in boxers only) was screened. Why I have no idea, but I guess it was a way for TeeVee ol' chap to distract attention from the fact that he now crossed a boundary into a dangerous territory - the THIRTIES.  Thats why, in my consideration I bought him a pack of 'Thirty Plus' - you know the stuff that Jeetendra used to try to sell us. The stuff that gives you that additional spurt of energy when you 'really really' need it. Then again as TeeVee reminded us there is always Viagra. That said, I am not getting any younger. Damn! I'll be 26 in two months time - and the talk (well, rather the idea) of settling down has been swirling in my head. As one would say in Hindi -  Kya Karoon Ab?  Getting married as I have said before is a very very hairy thought - and its a no way Jose scene as of now! Theres that and there is now the requirement to buy a bloody car. I need one - so after a lot of consideration - which includes - price, fuel economy and ability to park easily - I have solidified my choice on the WagonR LXi. As of now that is! Chalo, now lets watch the cricket match and see how the Indians fare! We might just win.
