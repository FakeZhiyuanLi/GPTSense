      I have been listening to my chemical romance a lot lately. i really don't know what to write about because nothings happened besides me watching movies and listening to music. for 2 days thats all i've done such excitement. i feel alone so much lately its scary i'm starting to feel like i used to before november. but theres something i do to make me feel better and it might sound like it wouldn't help but its the only thing that keeps me from screaming my head off. i do what i always do when i feel bad and it always helps. i never had this before november so i'm still curious how i made it through the night every night. i hope i will never lose what helps me because if i did i couldn't imagine living anymore there would be nothing for me. my friends are all leaving to do their own thing for a while and i'm here. but i still have the most important thing in my life and the knowledge my friends will return. without friends you have nothing. but i still feel alone a lot of the time but its because i am alone all the time i have nothing to do i'm just locked in my room laying on the floor trying to keep my sanity of what i've lost many years ago. come to think of it i used to be completly insane not giving a flying fuck about anything or anybody i would live for myself and nobody else and everybody could die for all i cared. but actually i wanted to die i really did i wanted a release from the lonleyness that consumed my brain. but i was too afraid to do it myself thats why i used to never&nbsp;care if i died now i understand. i wanted to be set free i wanted peace in my life from all the thoughts running around telling me how much of a worthless piece of shit i was. then she came.. the one to set me free but not in the way i imagined.. she set my heart free to think for me and lock away all the thoughts that burned my sanity. i developed a sense of sanity again.. i care now about my life but for her and our futures together that we promised to have. she is all i think about i cry out her name in my sleep when i feel hopeless and she gives me hope a hope for life. i still couldn't give a fuck what people think about me. she is the one i think about when i feel alone just thinking about her brings a smile to my face. i love her so deeply and completly. i will do anything and everything for her untill the day i die in her arms. the past of my mind has been almost completly erased thanks to her all i think about now is the future with her and the people who invelop our lives like our friends. (especially ashley, you know you are fucking awesome cuz, i love you! thanks for everything.) laters

      There is seriously nothing to do around here, i think i'm gonna start writing a short film today just a few to get practice for when i want to make a real movie. being a writer director has been something i've wanted since 8th grade. i always thought i had to do it alone and i worried about if i could do it but now that i have jessica with me and she wants to do the same thing i do it gives me more hope and inspiration to make a movie. i think we can become big but we don't really care about that we just want to make movies for fun but if we can make money from it it would definitly be a bonus. anybody who would want to participate in it can talk to either me or jessica and we'll see what we can do. but today i'm just gonna write for practice we probably wont even use it. she is so awesome i love her so much she will come up with such great ideas that are so funny its incredible. see ya in the movies. later

      I have a feeling the titles will keep being song titles from songs i'd be listening to at that moment. I'm getting used to being alone in my room again after a while of going insane like i was in a padded cell i really wanted to just break everything in my room just to get out all this emotion out of me. I began thinking today about why do our emotions drive everything we do? when we get depressed it controls everything we do same with angar, happiness, fear. everything is driven by how we feel but is that what makes us human? we can't live without feeling something and acting upon it but will there be a way to overcome it and do what our brain tells us not our genes and dna. but does our genes tell our brains what to think? i dunno i don't quite understand genetics at all. we are ruled by our emotions and its done well for us especially when you find that special person the one the person who makes your emotions go crazy to the point where you forget about emotion and reason you follow your heart and its done good by me cause my emotions go crazy when i'm around jessica like she hotwires me. The main emotion that goes off around her is intense happiness kinda like when you hmm i'm gonna be sitting here all day thinking about something to put it too but theres nothing that i know of that could match the happiness that i get around her but others occur at the exact same time but i'm not gonna get in detail about those. ha i think i'm getting a pattern of opening with a song title and ending with the greatest thing thats ever happened to me and thats my other half my life my woman. till next time, laters

      Don't mind the title its this song I'm listening to right now from "My Chemical Romance". They are so awesome they are like a mix of the used and afi. I was at record and tape traders and I got them, "Blindside", and "Velvet Revolver" cds. My grandma is making me nervous when she's driving like I usually never care about whats gonna happen next I live in the moment cause you never know what will happen in the future so why worry about whats not there?? but she makes me thing an accident is so close cause she is so nervous all the time driving i swear she's gonna have a heartattack driving.&nbsp; Yesterday like I said I felt like shit but I was just really lonely and one person made me feel better and she has no idea she did it cause she didn't do anything but call me and that made me feel better I swear if I didn't have jessica I think I'd be dead right now cause all this shit going on around here is making me insane and I'll think about ending it but I think about her and I feel good. She always makes me feel good even when she dosen't realize she's doing it. My band have a name now its MAWB if you care to know what that stands for leave a comment... yea I could say it here but it's funner to make you wonder and ask hahaha. laters

      This is a new thing for me to put things out like this I probably will never get too personal there are a couple of people and I mean like 2 people who I can be completly myself and tell them anything and they know who they are, they know who I am.. I have been feeling so shitty today for some reason just like I'm worthless and so egh depressing. Jessica might fix this blog cause I have no idea what I'm doing she'll make it look so prettyful cause she is so amazing and awesome and I am in love with her. I know I'm gonna talk a lot about her cause she is such a big part of my life.
