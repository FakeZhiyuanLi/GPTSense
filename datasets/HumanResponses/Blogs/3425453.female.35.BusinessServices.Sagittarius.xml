      One more major thing to tell you!  Late Saturday night, I got a call from my old roommate from back home.  Let me fill you in on the history on me and him.  He was my roommate for about 2 years, starting back in the beginning of 1999.  Just friends, strictly platonic for the entire time he lived there.  Well about a week before he moved out, we went out one night to a local bar.  After many drinks, the last song was a slow one, so we danced.  For the first time, I definitely was feeling some sort of "feeling" as we danced.  So to make a long story short, we ended up kissing in my car.  Yeah, I liked it.  But when we got home I kind of freaked out a little, because it all came out of no where.  So I acted like nothing happened.  We have kissed one other time about 6 months later, and flirted on occassion.  But really nothing else ever happened.  A little over a year ago I went over to his house to watch a movie.  I was hoping he would kiss me again, but he didn't.  Turns out about a week later he got back with his ex gf, so nothing more happened.  Now I have moved away and he is single again.  So he calls me Saturday night and tells me that he wishes I never moved.  Also said that he regrets that he didnt say or do more when i was at his house that time.  He said he wanted to kiss me, but wasn't sure how I would feel about it.  I told him I wish he had.  So then we talked about how both of us are interested in seeing what could happen here.  So, he said he would try to plan a weekend to come down here for a visit.  He also said he would call me on Sunday.  Well, Sunday came and went with no phone call.  So did Monday and most of Tuesday.  So finally, I just went ahead and called him, thinking maybe since he had been drinking that he forgot that hwe said he would call (yeah, I know....I am weak!).  So I call, and left a message on his home phone.  Now it's Wednesday night and I STILL haven't heard back from him!  Geez, men really irritate me!  Why go through all that on Saturday to not call me again after that!  Was it just alcohol-induced confidence that made him call?  I think of all the guys I know, he should be comfortable enough with me to talk like normal people, sober.  This is the guy that has seen me first thing in the morning, late night drunk, laying on the couch with the flu, with hair color in my hair, and when I get home from the gym.  He has seen me at my worst.  I was so impressed that after all that, he still wanted to pursue something romantic.  Now I am just not impressed.  Why bother?

      Well, already I am slacking.  Let me fill ya in on my weekend and week so far.  Saturday night I went out with my friend Elaine.  We went downtown and hit the bars.  I have a theory about barhopping.  I have always found that when you switch places more than twice trying to have fun, you are trying too hard.  We just could not find the place to be!  We went from place to place to place.  All in all, I think we went into like 6 bars, didn't get downtown until around 9:45, and I was home by midnight.  Friday night was definitely more fun.    Somewhere in the middle of all this barhopping I did see something new.  We were walking past a place called the Cattle Company with a rainbow over it.  Yes, it's called the "Rainbow Cattle Company".  It's a gay country-western bar!  I HAD to go in and see this for myself, so in we went.  I have been to my share of country bars, but ya just don't see guy-guy couples 2-stepping back home!  When I moved to Austin, all my friends thought I would meet a cowboy.  i tried to explain that Austin is the exception to the stereotype in TX.  Not many "cowboys" in Austin.  Well, Saturday night I got to see them.  Yep, lots of gay men in cowboy hats, tight wrangler jeans, and big belt buckles!  I love it!  At the age of 35, I am glad I can still find new things to see and experience.  Sunday not too much happened.  I had planned to go to the pool, but it was overcast most of the day.  I was starting the South Beach diet on Monday, so did some meal planning and grocery shopping to prepare.  Other than that, just watched Sopranos.  Poor Adriana!  I feel for that girl, not an easy life being the girlfriend of a mob guy, then on top of it, she gets beat up, choked, and threatened by the FBI.  Now she is dead.  I am keeping up hope that since they didn't show it onscreen that maybe she is really not dead, and will reappear during sometime next season, since it is also the last season.  I just think Tony acted like it didn't happen.  Whereas in past weeks he seemed to genuinely care for the girl.  So either he is really cold and heartless, or something is not right.    Oh, I did get a phone call Sunday night from the guy I gave my number to on Friday.  I didn't answer because I was watching Sopranos, but I did return his call on Tuesday night.

      Hey, thanks for visiting my very first entry!  I guess I will start off by telling you a little about myself.  I am a 35 year old single woman.  I am often mistaken for someone in their late 20's.  I don't date men my own age very often, and have found that they seem to just keep getting younger.  I have some great friends and a pretty active social life.  It's not as busy since I recently moved, but its getting better.  I grew up in Maryland, just outside of Washington, DC, and I have recently moved to Texas.  I grew tired of the lame-ass dating scene in DC and decided it was timeto try a new place.  On this Blog, you will hear a lot about my dating adventures, and stories about me and my friends.  Some pretty funny stuff happens to us, and I think a lot of people will relate.  So girls, I hope you will find that you relate to me, and guys, I hope this might help you understand women better.  Let me start off my telling you about today.  Nothing overly exciting so far.  My friend E and I went to Baja Fresh for lunch.  I had it in my mind that I was going to get my 2nd tatoo today.  We walked down from the restaurant to the tatoo parlour over by UT, and I described to the guy what I wanted.  Apparently he has to design it for me.  So I had to leave him a $20 deposit, and I have an appointment for this Thursday evening to go in and see what he came up with, and get it done if I approve.  I decided I wanted a pair of wings and a halo.  I think it sounds cute, and spiritual at the same time.  Plus I like the irony of a good (angel) vs. bad (tatoo).  Kinda like sweet on the inside but with a little bit of a bad girl edge.  Anyway, spent the rest of the afternoon reading and did a little shopping.  Tonight I am going out downtown with E.  She is as crazy as me and I am sure I will have some godo stories for you tomorrow.  Stay tuned!  -SS
