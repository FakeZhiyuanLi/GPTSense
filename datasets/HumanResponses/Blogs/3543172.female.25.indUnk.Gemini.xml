       Hello to all of you, salut à toutes :-)   First off, thanks to all of you who came for the  Movie & Martini extravaganza @ Kim`s . It was COOL. & Kim, thanks for having us. :-)  You Rock!!  I  loved  the videos. They really hit home on how women are so so so negatively portrayed in the ads.  As objects (and not subjects) of our own destiny.... The impact on us is phenomenal. 3000 ads viewed daily. In the next 10 years, you'll be seeing about ten million nine hundred thousand ads. 10,950,000. Most of them, i guess, women.    To continue our discussion on media & women, let's bring magazines to our next meeting. I'd suggested males mags but let's do that another time. I'll get a movie about that another time.   For now, let's stick to women's & girls to keep the impact going.  WHERE: Royal Oak, Laurier street (between King Edward & Cumberland street)  Time: Same as usual 7:30  What you need: 1 magazine. Yourself.    ;-) See you tuesday. Anne-Sophie

      Bonjour les petites madames,  This time, I am all inviting you to the Collection, Tuesday, June 15, 7:30pm.  For the last few weeks, we have had a lot of fun discussing women issues, relationships, the impact of media, women role models, etc. But this time, I would like to propose something a little different.  First:  Each one of you should bring a baby or kid picture of yourself. Then, you need to present us a passion that you have, a book that you read, or an activity that you do and that the other girls don't really know about.  I think it would be a great way to solidify our bonds =)  By the way, the Collection manager told us he would do any Martini we want, who knows, we might even be able to negotiate a discount hihi!  Hope to see you all Tuesday and tonight (Friday) at our little potluck party.

      Salut!  Here's the update on this week's going ons for tuesday june 22nd.   1) To log on to your account, www.blogger.com then loging with name & password. I sent you all an invite, if you need one again email me cynsophie@yahoo.ca   2)Some of us are going to the golf shooting range at 6 (Jackie, Shoshannah, April, Anne-Sophie, Cynthia, the Swinging Sistahs). If you want to go, email we'll get organized.   WHERE: Rockliffe driving range to shoot a bucket of balls. A free expert giving us tips. It is very cheap $10 for 115 balls (so you share a bucket) and $2 to get clubs. (so $6 each)    3)  7:30  at Apryl's place. She couldn't post her message, so here it is for her.   Hey everyone!  As you know, I've invited y'all to my place for next Tuesday's meeting.  I actually live just in front of Jodi and Kim's place, so it's easy to find.  The address is 283 MacLaren St., and the apt. and buzzer # is 205.  I'm planning to make sangria (with white wine), but feel free to bring whatever you like.   There has been bits and pieces of discussion around Sex and the City and whether or not it can be read as a feminist show.  I would like to show a few clips from the show and hopefully delve deeper into the discussion.  I'm planning to also post some articles on our blog (if I can figure out how to do so).  I've also been reading a lot about Showtime's new series called The L Word, which is a show about a group of lesbians.  I've downloaded a few episodes, and I think it would be interesting to watch some clips and compare the female friendships and love relationships to those of SATC.   I think it would also be very interesting to hear why everyone has joined this group, and what each woman hopes to gain/contribute or discuss in future meetings.  Hope everyone can make it for some sangria and some Sexy conversation!!!     4) New Invitees:   I've added Rebecca & Sabine to join us. So please include them in your emails. They're 2 really awesome girls with great head on their shoulders, mucho pizzaz & style, fab ideas and great life experiences... amongst other things. So Welcome to you both, look forward to seeing you soon.:)     THAT'S IT FOR ME TODAY! Can't wait to go golfing. At least this time, my brother won't be there to hit me in the head with his golf club like he did 12 years ago, the bastard! ;)   Anne-Sophie.

      Hello ladies!  I'm looking forward to the collection tomorrow night and seeing some more baby pics.  Anne-Sophie, you are so cute!  You've hardly changed.  Well, I'd like to extend an invitation to the group to come to my home, perhaps for our June 22nd meeting?  I'd be happy to make sangria for everyone and come up with a topic as well.  We can stay here for a couple of hours and then head out, depending on what everyone wants to do.  Vincent has no problem making himself scarce for the evening :)  We can discuss it at tomorrow's meeting!  See you then.  xo Apryl

      Hey ladies!  I just wanted to post a link to a website that contains a lot of discussion on "The L Word".  This should give everyone some background information on the show, its plot and the characters.  Here is the link: www.afterellen.com/TV/thelword/firstseason/html  If it doesn't allow you to click on it you should be able to copy and paste the url.  See everyone on Tuesday!

      Hi guys,  Sorry for the short notice, but I got quite a good idea for this week.  Let's meet and do a little Tarot, palm reading, ouija and intuition card session!  April said we can do it at her place... (Thanks April) she will send the indications to get there soon.  So bring all the spiritual stuff you have home... I will try to bring a few candles and tea so we can create a relaxing ambiance... You are welcome to bring anything you would like!  See you tomorrow!  Cynthia

      Salut à toutes! Hello!  This tuesday, i would like to talk about sports. Not like the guys tho, unless you want to. Personally, I like to keep my body busy with loads of activities (walk, blade, cycle, run, swim, softball, yoga, etc..) Keeps it and my brain happy. i thought it would be cool to talk about how we all compose with the daily realitiy of physical activity, what makes us feel good and why.   Since we`re talking about that and since I LOVE gelato, what do you say we all get some ice cream, have a chat while we`re there and then decide if we want to just go for a walk after that or if it`s crappy, we`ll relocate to an indoor location, maybe the Manx or the Pump.  So we`ll meet up at PURE GELATO on Elgin Street. I`ll have my cell if need be: 371-6352 @ 7:30 for ice cream, and probably move out of there by about 8:15 @ the latest.  See you then! Don`t wear lipschtick, we're licking some ice cream.....   Anne-Sophie.
