       today we all went to the stream again...it seems like we practically live there. anyway, it was fun, especially when my flip-flop floated downstream to the deep part and j had to swim to get it for me! we had to walk through a field of stinging nettles on the way home...that was two hours ago and my legs are still in agony...it can't be a good thing. we made a friend! dave! some 'skater' we met as he cycled past the stream. he can't really skate, and he has the scrawniest legs...you could snap them...it's weird! anyway we had a five minute conversation with him and then he cycled off into the village. tomorrow grandma arrives...great. tomorrow me, j, sara and meg might  be going to the cinema, but i have no idea what we're going to see. i'm starving to death! i'm so hungry...

       ok, i know my life is starting to sound like it revolves around the weather, but-shocking-today it was sunny! woo! we didn't go to the stream though, cos no-one could really be bothered. so we rented out some films from good old dillons or one stop or whatever they call it these days. we watched underworld and session 9. session 9 is rubbish, hard to understand and people hack eachothers eyes out (or so i heard-i was hiding behind a cushion) it was meant to be a psychological thriller...it didn't float my boat if i'm honest. second film, underworld, was good. vampires and werewolves and stuff...anyway, my day was better than yesterday even though i'm bored now. and i'm 'talking' to andrew on msn who seems about as cheerful as dung beetle. ah well. better go and get some chocolate...

       my sunburn is stinging so bad...i'm kinda glad its not sunny today. we're going to the stream again, we were meant to be swimming in it today-no way. i have 3 bruises from last time, when i fell in. there is no chance i'm swimming in there. if it brightens up, i might dare to dip my toe in, but the memories of falling flat on my face while sara practically falls off the bridge because of laughing at me, and j and meg screaming away like hyenas. ah well. spoke to dad...new plan, grandma arrives on friday. great. and she's taking me to see the god damn lion king musical and then she's taking me to madame toussauds. great. so anyway it's nice and cold so of course, we are going to go and sit out in it. our logic is amazing. when its sunny, we sit there looking bored. when its cold, we go and paddle in the stream. our intellect knows no boundries. i'm going to go and get a wooly jumper and brave the weather.

       cheered up considerably now. my burnt meal has made me realise light-heartedness is the way forward. i'm in a really sarcastic mood now. my parents are listening to some classic 60s cd and it's made me look at life differently. who am i kidding...life still sucks. ah well, my new, refreshed point of view is guiding me towards the tv...

       i'm bored, people! i swear i'm more bored now. this is sooo boring! have you ever noticed that just the word 'bored' makes you feel even more bored than you already are? it's an evil word. i even typed in www.bored.com to see if it would help me escape this boredom but no, nobody can stop me being as bored as i am now. there are 2 people on msn-2! it's silly. nowhere to go, no-one to talk to and nothing to do. i feel like a tinned pickle.

       i'm sitting here, completely bored, NOTHING to do. i want to know why my life is so boring. well, today is particularly boring cos i haven't been out all day and i'm just stuck in this stupid house with nothing to do and no humans to talk to except my parents...but they don't count cos my mum's glued to the computer, trying to fix some error thingy, and my dad's...somewhere...(not sure...havent seen him in a while...) it's dark, it's grey...it's britain in july...and i am soooo bored i think i just might curl up and die. advantages of curling up and dying: -the boredom will stop -i find out what happens after death -i get missed by a few people -i get on the local news (?) -people will remember me as the girl who died of boredom -i'll be kinda famous -i don't have to eat, sleep or bother doing anything disadvantages of curling up and dying: -i die (obvious, yet important) -people miss me (hopefully) -no more life...bye bye life, boring or not -i'll never get older -i'll never do what i want to do in my life -never get married -never have kids i've decided i won't die just yet. but i'm warning you people, if i get any more bored than i am now it's over. i will sit in a corner and die, with a note in my hand saying 'im bored'. grr. i'm so bored! if boredom was a physical action, it would be hitting your head against a brick wall over and over until you die

       i've been looking at the weather forecast for the area, and it isn't looking good. cloudy, grey, warm-ish but quite cold...there's no way i'll be swimming in that stream tomoorow like we planned. thursday looks good though...well, if you call 23 degrees 'hot'...but it's the hottest it's going to be for like, a month. so i think we'll be taking advantage of it while it lasts. tomorrow we're going to the stream again, with swimming stuff just incase 20 degrees is warm (we must be mad) i dont intend to fall in again...infact, this time i might stay out of the water with sara...or at least paddle in the middle rather than going under the bridge where it's deep. this time i'm bringing spare clothes, incase i do fall in again (i hope i dont) all i have really done today is go on and offline, waiting for there to be someone interesting to talk to. but obviously everyone else in the world is having a fun holiday instead of being stuck at home. why does everyone seem to have better things to do than to get online and talk to me?! ah well, tomorrow we're going to the damn stream again, and we'll probably keep going there throughout this week until it gets boring. i've got to admit, the stream is fun. well, apart from when some old guy and his stupid staffie called smudge came over the bridge. that stupid dog ate all our raspberry cookies. and it ripped j's magazine. if people are going to let their dogs off their leads in public places, they should at least be trained. why do people feel the need to let their untrained dogs torment youngsters? lol. it's just silly. train your dogs, people! i mean, i like dogs and everything, they're lovely animals, but if they jump at you and bark and snarl and eat your reading material and your lunch, it isn't fair! do you see me doing that? no! because i am trained...well, just taught good old fashioned manners, but it's all the same. if i went round eating people's belongings and growling at them, not only would i be locked up in some padded cell (which would actually be quite fun) but i would also be stared at in disgust! i would be named a complete freak, and it's the same with dogs. if you're going to keep a pet, train the thing before you let it loose on innocent by-standers. being mauled by some crazy, out of control hairball is not my idea of fun. there's a difference between a friendly animal and a down-right crazy animal. that's my rant for the day anyway. lol.

       just spoken to dad. she arrives tuesday and leaves saturday. i can not and will not stay at home next week. that's it, i'm going to live outside and at other people's houses. the reasons for hating this woman are as follows: -she sticks her great big hairy nose in where it's not wanted -she's impolite and has no manners -if she's left alone in the house she'll look through your room, searching high and low for incriminating evidence and/or anything she'd like to steal -she throws things at the cats...in the past this has included handbags, stones, food and mugs of tea -she is just plain ugly -she has disgusting eating habits and table manners -she smells like 'old woman' -she says i'm good enough to eat and tries to hug me -she wears weird old lady clothes -she doesn't appreciate the term 'privacy' -she likes nothing about you, and she lets you know it -she is queen of her world, and nobody else is good enough -she thinks i'm 4 years old -she treats me like i'm 4 years old -she's nasty -she can't miss her god damn soaps...if you come between her and her precious soap operas, you're dead -she eats a lot those are the problems i have with my grandma. and no, i'm not being picky just because i don't like her, the fact she smells like an old woman is not my problem, and it really is a design fault. i have a really fun week ahead...which reminds me, i have to buy a lock for my door so she can't get in and rummage through my stuff.

       discovered my arms got all sunburnt yesterday...it was 'fun' trying to sleep lastnight when every time i rolled over my arms stung like mad...i swear half my skin peeled off onto the sheets...nice. so anyway, today it's nice and dull and boring and grey and british...and this morning i got woken up by some stupid dog howling in a garden somewhere, which set off the whole town's dogs, so by the time i'd got out of bed there were at least 5 or 6 dogs howling and barking. i came downstairs to be greeted by the news that good old grandma's coming to stay for a week-oh, the fun. she arrives tomorrow or tuesday so i'm staying out with meg, j and sara all day every day. that woman is pure evil. i am not staying in a house with her all week, and then having visits to the occasional garden center. nope, that is not my fate. no way. i'm going to enjoy that week. i'm determined. so anyway, expect a lot of angry, grandmother-hating, stressed out blogs in the next week cos she's going to be here and she's going to be driving me crazy. grr. phrase for the day: I'M BURNT, TIRED AND BORED AND SOME STUPID OLD WOMAN IS COMING TO LIVE IN MY HOUSE FOR A WEEK...I'M NOT HAPPY!

       good god. what a day. i can hardly type cos of the fact i'm freezing cold and recovering from being absolutely terrified. today me, meg, j and sara went to the stream again...we went in, fully prepared-trousers rolled up and sarongs fluttering in the breeze. me and j were the first to go in, and the freezing water made our feet numb! then meg went in. sara wisely refused. we paddled around for a bit then we ate our picnic consisting of sweets, biscuits, crisps and a single, useless chicken sandwich, hand-prepared by my very own mother. after that we went in the stream again, which was knee-high, and guess who had to fall in? me. so then on our wet, depressed and generally boring way back, walking along the roadside, j in a skirt and a white, soggy top, which looked see-through because of the water, we look down at the ground as we walk, having abandoned meg and sara to pick out thistles and glass from meg's feet. whilst looking at the crickets and grass-hoppers, i spot a grass-snake, slithering nearer and nearer towards us. we screamed and ran along the road until we got worn out. then a beaten up old red car beeped us, and went up towards a lay-by to stop. we were terrified, and ran the other way until we realised it had gone. we calmly walked up, only to find the same red car slowing towards us. it stopped and we suddenly realised it was only j's brothers, laughing at us being so scared. we walked home, wet and terrified, as they beeped us one last time for another laugh. i got in, soaked and miserable, and wrote this blog as soon as i could. i'm getting my dinner, then i'm having a long, warm bath. phrase for the day- THE COUNTRYSIDE TAKES NO PRISONERS!

       hi this is my first entry and i'm doing it cos jade persuaded me to so sorry if its really awful. today i am the most bored person alive and i'm waiting until meg finishes work so me, jade, meg and sara can go to the woods with a picnic trying to spook ourselves with horror stories and the fact that everytime we go down there we hear whistling following us. i try to be logical about it but i really do think there's something going on down there. apparently someone died. and this time we're going to have some bloke called ralph palmer following us cos we sat in his bird hut. seriously, we sat in a dead guy's bird watching hut and didn't read the sign til we were all inside, making ourselves at home. 'this birdwatching hut is in memory of ralph palmer, who made many contributions to the nature reserve and who enjoyed frequent visits to the area. he was found here.' very comforting to know that a dead body was found in the bird hut you've just gone and sat in. then we sat on philip clarke's bench, but by then we couldn't be bothered anymore. ralph and phil obviously do some late night drinking by the lake when death gets tough. phrase for the day- WE CAN'T WIN!

        i haven't been on blogger for a while so i decided to make an effort and write something about something. i haven't written something about anything in 10 days...long time. tonight meg, sara and j are coming over for a sleepover at my house which should be a laugh. yesterday we went shopping, which was fun. no more swimming in streams at the moment, the weather has gone wrong. i think it is due to a hurricaine thingy but i don't know. i was up at 7.33am. i am tired. i think i might go back to bed.

       i have endured 5 days of my evil grandma. she insulted my friends, watched me as i ate, told me how to use an iron when i already can, ate things noisily, was nasty all the time, was nosey, looked around my room uninvited and went through my drawers and my wardrobe. i am so glad she's gone. she left this morning at 10am. my mum's taken her back and my dad's at work so i have the house to myself all day. at 12 i'm calling on sara...don't really know what we're going to do today. yesterday we stayed at meg's and watched 'thirteen ghosts' which wasn't scary in the least. ah well. it was funny when a lawyer got chopped in half...not that i like that sort of thing. charlotte and fran come back from germany on wednesday apparently. i have some new shoes, they're stripey. my dad got them for me when we went to cambridge on sunday with grandma. i could've hit her. glad i didn't though. she would've gone crazy. anyway, apparently i don't eat enough and i should clear my plate every mealtime. apparently i'm too skinny. well at least i'm not a fat old lady. anyway, she can jump off a cliff before i ever take any notice of her. she reckons i have eating problems? she should try to look at herself as she eats and see if she can stomach it. it's horrible. you can hear it churning around in her mouth like a washing machine, just like when my dad eats, which is also a disgusting experiance. i'm glad he only eats late at night when i'm watching tv. he thinks i turn up the volume to aid his deafness, but i turn up the volume to try and block the sound of food slopping around, and that horrible noise when he clicks the roof of his mouth with his tongue. this is worse with noisier foods, like toast, but he manages it with anything. when he eats egg i get suicidal. and he talks with his mouth full. and he has a dodgy jaw which snaps and clicks continuously while he eats. it makes me feel sick and to say it puts me off my food is an under statement. all this adds up to make meal times more of an endurance test, and so me and my mum eat separately from him while he's still at work. but now, during the holidays, with the exception of today, he's always home. and him and grandma put together makes me finish my meal as soon as i can. you can tell they're mother and son, i'll put it that way.
