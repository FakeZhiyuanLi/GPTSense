      alright, i kno i've been neglecting you guys...and im sorry about that.  for those of you who dont know, i lost the drum major position at my school...so i'm just sorta dealin w/that.  other than that, my life's been pretty much straightforward, school, homework, brian, blue devils.  so yeah...later.

      so yeah...done w/my ap exams, which is a very good thing.  now, in history, all we're doing is watching movies and playing really fun games, and in environmental science we're designing a sustainably developed city, which is actually a really cool project.  we've got the concert coming up on tuesday, which should be very interesting, as i will not be able to leave the stage at all.  o boy!  alrighty then...n e wayz...have practice on saturday, and we'll probably get more drill sheets, which will be a very good thing!

      so yeah...i've been looking around, and trying to figure out if im gonna stay w/xanga or not.  the thing is, im really comfortable w/xanga, and i feel a weird sort of loyalty to it, but more importantly, i dont wanna leave whoever actually reads this hanging.  but i've already got blog people waiting for entries, and all my school friends are on live journal.  so i think im just gonna write all of my entries on xanga, and copy them to all 3 of my journals, so all the groups can sorta be a part of that...so yeah...just thought i'd let you in on the loop, even though you probably dont care.

      sorry that it's been a while guys. so...where were we? well, i got out of school, which definetly takes a big load off for a while, except that i've got calculus homework over the summer. but that's all right. now i just have blue devils, and of course, spend time with friends. and bf. wow...brian's been really great these past weeks...he's just kept me somewhat sane, and shown me the light at the end of the tunnel.  we had our first performances this past weekend, and though the scores may not have reflected what we wanted them to, we all felt pretty darn good about those shows. we've got a long way to go, but at least we have somewhere to go. i'm doing what i love, and it's great.
