      A while back, I decided to say "To Hell with a sprained foot, I'm gonna go make a Jackass of myself!" So, I called up one of my buddies and we went to Warner Robins in his little white Dakota Sport.  Things started innocently enough. We went to a Music Store; he bought a copy of STYX-THE GREATEST HITS, and I bowed before a large PINK FLOYD: THE WALL poster. I tried to convince the clerk, a middle-aged woman who, in my diagnosis, has taken far too much acid for one person, to give the poster to me. She kindly refused, but said that if I come back in a few weeks, she always gives away posters that she has taken down. So there is hope.  We got back into the truck, and we started cranking "Mr. Roboto" as loud as it could go. We were singing along, getting VERY into the song. So much so that I have blown my voice and still have a ringing in my ears. We cruised around for about three hours, singing along with "Mr. Roboto" and "Renegade." We had the two on infinite loop.  We came upon a Krystal's, where a gaggle of girls were hanging out. We started dancing and singing to them. Imagine if you will: A good fourteen girls outside a Krystal's being danced at by a mechanic in a ball cap, and an Elvis impersonator in an ill-fitting, unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt on top of another shirt. The girls stared at us, and started dancing to "Mr. Roboto." We, of course, saw the opportunity, and pulled into the parking lot. They all yelped, in an odd sort of panic, and jumped into their vehicles, and sped off into the night. I can't really imagine why. My buddy and I are harmless goofballs. Well, I often get mistaken for a guy in my thirties, so they probably thought we were two perverted old guys, looking for "innocent" teenage girls. Note the quotation marks surrounding the word 'innocent' Not that I'm cynical or anything.  We continued cruising, and came upon a school bus full of Houston County cheerleaders. I started belting out "Desperado" to them, which was still at top-volume. "THE JIG IS UP, THE NEWS IS OUT, THEY'VE FINALLY FOUND ME! YOU RENEGADE YOU HAD IT MADE!" etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.  Their windows were down, so they could hear it, full blast. They all pointed and stared. Finally, we lost track of the bus. So, what's the next logical thing to do? It is, of course, to go to the Kay-Bee Toys in the mall, and buy a Ringo action figure, from YELLOW SUBMARINE. And that's just what we did. I accused him of being jealous of my Ringo, of course. He said he was not, and my retort was "Who wouldn't be?"   He pointed at the little clerk girl. So, I dove to the counter, and launched into it: "Hi. I'm Trevor Mullis. Excuse me, but, would you, or would you not be jealous of this Ringo-Action-Figure?" Her reaction was a confounded: "What's a Ringo?"  So, I, of course, launched into a history of the Beatles, and YELLOW SUBMARINE. After explaining it all, she said, tragically: "No, I don't think I'd be jealous." I slammed my head on the counter, paid for the Ringo, refused a bag, and left, holding Ringo triumphantly over my head.  After that, we continued Cruising With Styx. We came upon a playground where a couple was obviously having a Big Romantic Moment. The guy was on his knees, in front of the girl, who was sitting on the Merry-Go-Round. We started being loud, jumping around, sliding down slides, playing around. We figured that would make the moment all the more romantic. No, it did not, apparently, as they quickly left after our arrival.  By this time, my vocal chords were long-since-dead, but I still continued to sing with Styx, ignoring the pain. We drove through the Walmart parking lot, singing at the top of our lungs ("DOMO ARIGATO, MR. ROBOTO!") and got quite a bit of applause and laughs from other teens in their respective vehicles.   Finally, we went to Target, where I accused the Talking Hulk doll of being Satan incarnate, and running away, when it said to me "HULK SMASH!" It got the clerks' attentions. So, we quickly left.  So endeth the great adventure.

      Have you ever thought about what a strange word "Such" is? I have. Many a night, I find myself saying it, very slowly; sounding it out. It sounds especially strange that way. I wonder who came up with it, and why.  Another oddity in the English language is the phrase "My very soul." What does that mean? Your soul is very what? Very tall? Very delicious? Very self-conscious? This is the stuff that keeps me up night. That, and drinking far too many caffeinated products. Go figure.

      July 1, 2004: 3:43 PM Wow. Summer vacation is nearly over, for those still in school that is. What with me being a high school graduate and whatnot, I don't really have to worry about school this upcoming year. Hahaha! Gonna be a college dropout, yeah yeah yeah! Well, maybe not. But probably.  All the years that I was in school, graduation and its aftermath were supposed to have been life altering occurrences. I halfway expected to be able to fly. Alas, that did not occur, so I learned about three days after graduation. Limped away with only a skinned knee luckily.   Don't really have any more to say right now. Well, I could write about why my sister shoved a tampon up my nose the other night, but I shall leave that for another time.
