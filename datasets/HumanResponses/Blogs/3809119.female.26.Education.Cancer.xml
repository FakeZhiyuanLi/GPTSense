       urlLink     Yesterday I took my younger sister Natalie to Canada's Wonderland.&nbsp; I had not been in probably 5 years and she hadn't been in a few years either so we were both really excited.&nbsp; The day got off to a rough start when I was on the 400 highway and noticed the low gas light on.&nbsp; With some trouble and a lot of anxiety, we managed to find a gas station in some town&nbsp;I've never heard of.&nbsp; There wasn't another cut off for quite some time, so if I hadn't noticed the light when I did we could have been stranded on the highway.&nbsp; ANyway, we filled up the van with gas and carried on to Wonderland.&nbsp; We got there just after opening and were on our first ride by 10:30ish.&nbsp; THe line-ups were pretty short 15-20 minutes max.&nbsp; In one case we were able to walk right onto the ride.&nbsp; We did 5 rollercoasters in our first 2 1/2 hours there.&nbsp; It's funny how when you're a kid the rides seem so scary - but as you grow older the thrill of them kind of is gone.&nbsp; They're still lots of fun though - just not terrifying.&nbsp; After five roller coasters I was feeling a bit queazy ( I guess motion sickness comes with getting&nbsp;older too)&nbsp;&nbsp;and wanted a break from the coasters for a few minutes so we were going to go on the go-carts.&nbsp; Just a few minutes before our turn to go, it started to rain ... and rain ... and rain...&nbsp;&nbsp; They closed the go-cart ride because of&nbsp; the "dangerous road conditions."&nbsp; We thought we'd wait out the rain.&nbsp; So we waited ... and waited ... and waited, all the while getting more and more wet.&nbsp; We waited under the awning of a game, then we dashed through the rain and stood behind the door of a store, then we went in the store and looked around for quite awhile - and decided to split a huge funnel cake for lunch.&nbsp; Then we waited in line for an indoor ride (a haunted mansion thing) - thinking that since it was inside it would be running.&nbsp; We were waiting for several minutes before we realized the line wasn't moving because that ride too had been shut down.&nbsp; We decided to wait out the rain anyway.&nbsp; We were probably waiting in that line for close to an hour.&nbsp; Unfortunately it just kept raining harder and harder and there was no sign of any of the rides re-opening in the near future.&nbsp; We were wet, cold and miserable.&nbsp; It was thundering and lightning and it was becoming clear that the day was shot.&nbsp; It started raining at 1:05 and when it was still raining after 3:00 with the sky still looking dark and the storm intensifying we decided to leave.&nbsp; There was so much rain on the grounds in some spots that it wasn't draining right so I had water literally up to between my ankles and knees (and honestly I'm not exagerating).&nbsp; We left very disapointed.&nbsp; We hadn't even got to try the newer coasters -all the ones we did first were the classics that we've been on lots before.&nbsp; I felt&nbsp;really bad for Natalie because when I picked her up in the morning she was bouncing all over the place with excitement.&nbsp; (I felt bad for myself too).   Anyway, after wonderland we decided to go shopping in K-W - figured we might as well do something fun since our day was ruined.&nbsp; Natty bought a cute tank top and a belt (which kind of made&nbsp;up for the failed trip)&nbsp;and I bought some hangers.&nbsp; Natty had wanted to get fries with gravy at Wonderland so we had fries with gravy for supper at the food court in the mall.&nbsp; Then we surprised my sister and brother-in-law in Elmira and visited them for awhile before heading home.&nbsp;   I guess the worst part of the day was that Wonderland does not give refunds (even though they shut down the rides) - so we paid for a full day but got only 2 1/2 hours.&nbsp; Unfortunately I probably won't get back this season but for Natty's sake I really hope she's able to go again and finish off what we started yesterday.

       urlLink     urlLink      Well, I return to the blogging world with some good news this Thursday evening.  As some of you know, I had an interview today for two full-time, permanent French teaching positions, one in Dundalk and the other in Maxwell. I did not feel that the interview went as well as I would have hoped.  I guess I was somewhat out of practice and I thought I was jumping all over the place with some of my answers.  The panel of interviewers included two principals (Jan Powell and Oscar Burnside) and a Vice Principal (Carole Burgess). The interview lasted aproximately 25 minutes.  About an hour ago I received an important phone call.  Mr Burnside called, saying "... how would you like to join us at Osprey (in Maxwell) ..." Obviously I accepted the position.  I'm officially an "internal" member of the Bluewater District School Board now.  All I can say is "Praise God!"

      As most of you know I'm working at Talisman this summer.  I work in the Golf Clubhouse reserving tee-off times, giving people their "Green Fees" and selling merchandise basically.  Seems easy enough.  I had two days of "training" and then last night I was on my own.  I was responsible for closing down the store at the end of the night - with no help.  What a disaster!  There are a gazilion responsibilities at the end of the day (and I'd only watched someone close once) so I really had no idea what I was doing.  I couldn't get my cash to  balance and had no idea how to fix the problem (supossedly the bookeeper doesn't like it when we don't find and solve the problem ourselves). I finally just handed in the huge mistake with a note saying that I was "new." I have a ring of keys with a ton of diff. keys on them and couldn't find the right one to lock the door so I had to call a porter to come help me lock up.  I should have ended my shift at 8:00pm, instead I was there until 9:50.  Not fun. I was hoping for a stress-free job this summer. A break from teaching  ... something I could go in and work for 8 hours then forget about when I got home.  After my training days I thought that might happen.  Definitely won't be if I'm closing everynight though(and it looks like I will be).    I guess I should be thankful that God provided me with a job this summer and stop complaining.  I'll try ... but I still don't think I'll ever like closing up ... too many responsibilities and too little training.

       urlLink    Creation Calls&nbsp; urlLink     After reading various other people's blogs and really enjoying the discussions and issues raised on them, I decided to start one myself. I know the title is kind of cheezy - I have Dave to thank for that - but it does suit me somewhat though because I do love gardening!  There's something about being outside and working in the yard that draws me closer to God.  As a kid I couldn't figure out how people could be excited about nature.  I found it boring and I guess I took it for granted. Now that I'm a bit older I appreciate it more.  I really don't understand how someone could believe that the earth was a result of evolution.  Just being outside and looking at the perfection of how nature works and the flawless design is proof of God's creation.
