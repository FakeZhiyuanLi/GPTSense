						   The more I here about Iraq on the news, the more upset I get about the US being there.  The latest polls show the the Majority of Americas believe that our government never should have gotten involved in Iraq.  I personally oppose the way the Bush Administration entered Iraq and how they have handled situations over their since the war ended.  I see our administration as arrogant and isolating itself frrom our world friends like France and Germany.  Our administration wants the world to go by international laws but that they shouldn't pertain to them.  With Iraq & Afghanistan, they have circumvented United Nation Laws and International Torture Laws, but we expect other countries to comply.  The Bush Administation has made our country look like an aggressive imperialist country again.  To answer the blog title question, has America been succeesful in Iraq, I would say yes but....  This country has been successful at a high cost.  The adminstration has circumvented international torture laws, lied to the American public and we have lost way too many troops in so-called post-Iraq War time frame.  However since are troops are their, we need to finish the job.  Otherwise that country will fall into a major civil war.  This blog contains my opinions and information I have read via the internet, radio, newspaper...... Matt J

						   I was reading a blog entry on another personal website that I found quite interesting.&nbsp; The guy was mentioning that many of the blogs he has read from other young gay men's personal websites seem to have a common theme.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a few&nbsp;gay men seem to drink a lot, do drugs, often can be promiscous&nbsp;&amp; have a bit of a self-esteem problem.&nbsp; Like this guy wrote in his blog that I was reading, part of this is due to the fact they are young, however a large can be related to gay men on an average not being excepted by their families.&nbsp; Many gay men turn to drugs and alcohol because their families are either mean, absent or not wanting anything to do with them.&nbsp; Society has gotten better at excepting gays &amp; why not.&nbsp; Were not perverts, we are everyday people who are trying to make something of ourselves and our lives.&nbsp; We want good friends, families who will except us for who we really are and that special MR Right.&nbsp; Do gay men think about getting married, yes we do.&nbsp; We are searching for that special guy that we can share our lives together and become an official couple.&nbsp; However, we (gay men) first need to be happy with ourselves before we can want or expect others to like us.&nbsp; Be happy with who you are, the real you.&nbsp; If your putting on a fake front, your not going to be happy.&nbsp; Life is too short to be miserable, live life in a constructive, happy, upbeat manner.&nbsp; If you don't know how to live life&nbsp;like that, find out.&nbsp; I have my bad days like most, but have learned a lot about myself over the last year or so.&nbsp; Sooner or later that special someone will come by.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am much more aware of myself now to tackle a solid, good relationship then I was a a couple years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some thoughts I have been meandering about for a day or two.

						   The Bush Adminstration's Marriage Protection Amendment in my eyes is a farse.  This is a way for Bush to insert his anti-gay agenda into the constitution.  The US Constitution and marriage are to me very sacred documents/institutions.  The US Constitution has stood up against discrimination.  Why would someone want to alter it to promote hatred and discrimination?  Bush promoted Marriage Protection Amendment would prohibit gays from getting married, civil unioned or granted any of the rights of marriage.  We (gay population) are being purposely singled out and told you can't have this right because of who you are.  Just because I am a gay man who is naturally attracted to men, doesn't make me a better or a worse person than anyone else.  When I fall head over heels for that special guy, I will want to get married.  Shouldn't I have that right.  I see all the the happiness and benefits of marriage from my family.  I want that for myself too.  This week Congress more than likely will vote on this matter, please stand up and let Bush & your Congressmen/women know that you are against inserting discrimination into the US Constitution.  Here's a sample letter format that you can use (from MoveOn.org) to let your family and friends know about this upcoming historical vote & hopefully to rally them to stand up for equality in America:  ----------------------------------------  Subject: Please help right away -- we've got to stick together  Dear friend,   Congress is about to vote on amending the U.S. Constitution to deny marriage equality to same-sex couples.   Never before has our Constitution been amended to take away anyone's rights. Yet our Senators will vote on this amendment in the next 48 hours.   It's urgent that we speak up now. This hateful divisiveness has no place in America. Please join me in saying so, at:    urlLink http://www.moveon.org/unitednotdivided /   Equality in marriage is the civil rights issue of our generation. We can't let anyone, or any group, be singled out for discrimination based on who they are or who they love.   Thank you.   ---------------------------------------  Let's make the USA a United place not a divided place.  Please stand up for equality in this great country of ours. Matt J
