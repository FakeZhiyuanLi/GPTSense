      It's been a fairly average evening. I'm having a bbq tomorrow (WOOO!) they're one of my most favourite things to do, I dunno who's gonna come I think it's just gonna be a few people I except...Neal, Linny and myself I think, I wanna call for Bethan at some time but I'm too scared to at the moment cos I havent spoke to her too much and she's like one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen and I expect I'll just blush around her constantly but if I see her in town or something I'll ask her to hang out with us or something, I'll hint about it next time she comes on or something but I doubt she gives a shit...

       Turns out I wont be going out tonight. Everyone wants to do something, people just don't wanna hang out any more and just wonder round town talking to people, hanging out on the field, playing a bit of football, laying around and talking and stuff. No one can be bothered.

       Decided to start a blog last night but it kept going all wierd and wasnt doing what I wanted it too, it seems to be working now though.   Just woke up now, my sleeps been all funny recently because of the summer holidays. I've got no reason to go to bed at any specific times at the moment so I seem to be having like this whole&nbsp;6 hours sleep/6 hours of awake going on. I'll be sleeping all day and&nbsp;up till 4 one night and the next I'll be awake all day and&nbsp;in bed at half 6, it's kinda funny really.   My internet does this thing around 12ish all night long where it just disconnects you every 10 seconds, VERY annoying. I think it's to stop people taking advantage of the 'anytime' deal where they could just leave it on all night downloading. It's bad because theres nothing to do at 2 in the morning apart from come online, most of the channels end or either just go onto some crappy shopping thing.   Going out tonight, not sure where too...probably just around town or something. I'm hoping I'll run into someone but I'll see how that   goes.... I need money! I always get hungry when I'm in town and have like a pound or something on me and can never afford a pizza or a kebab or whatever or even just some chips, so I usually go hungry.   I can't stay in town too late because I don't have a car and I've gotta get my parents to pick me up. I would take the shortcut and go down the river but theres no way in hell I'm going down the river by myself in the dark, I'll get raped the shit out of or something. Everytime I seem to walk downtown in the evening someone will want a fight with me for no reason at all or I'll get chased and no one believes me that it happens either and the other day I had to walk home cos everyone went out even though they knew I needed a lift and I got chased all the way down the common. I can't believe people who are 17 are still chasing and starting on people, You would have thought they'd have grown out of the habbit really at around the age of 12 but meh.   My gran is coming round later to pick up some washing because our washing machine is broken, it's good to see them but I owe them some money and I'm supposed to go round and do some jobs but I get uncomfortable when I'm there for a while and I get quite tired. I might go on Sunday with mum but I know they're gonna try and drag me down today, I don't wanna go though..   I better go get breakfast and shower.

       I havent posted anything in a while, I kinda forgot about this thing....   I've decidedto buy a camera, from my video camera it's gotten me into photography quite alot and I've decided to get a good one, I've seen the one I wan't and I've just gotta get the money together now (difficult when you don't have a job).   I havent been upto much this holiday really. I ordered from iron on transfer paper to make some t-shirts or something, I'm probably gonna make a TD one since I've only even seen two to buy and they are crummy.   Found out about a show the spree might be doing with thir October tour, Hannah who I met briefly at the Shepherds Bush show owns an estate and she's booked them in to play in a tiny old church there, fits about 100 people she said and us board members will be on the guest list, I'm going to see if I can organise a photo pass for then so I can get in and take photographs which should be good because I'm putting together a portfolio to help me get a job in that sort of area.   I've decided in my year out I might take on a photography/graphic design course for AS at the local college, I'd have to organise it soon though, or maybe just a beginners course or something and go onto to do it at university...I haven't decided yet.

       OK well another average day today. I was gonna go out this evening but people was tired, I'm going camping tomorrow night and having a bbq but I'll go out in the day time and hang around for a bit with people.   I've had a wierd headache today, it's been going on and off all day at wierd times and it's been pissing me off but it's gone off now which is good.   Talking to someone for a good few hours today which was good, she was asking me alot of questions because she wanted to get to know me better or something, and she said I was cute and things like that a few times which was good, I sorta hinted at the idea of hanging out but very vaguely and didn't really say much at all, haha. Oh well, I'm hoping to hang out at least once before this holiday is over, I'd like to get to know her alot more.   I've got the house to myself for most of tomorrow until early eveningish around half 6. If I would have known earlier I could have organised something round here but I'm just gonna go out instead and save the hastle.   I'm getting broadband next week which should be exciting and very handy since I've finally got a decent internet speed which I'm very much looking foreward too, for downloads and being able to watch streaming movies and stuff etc..   I've spent most of my day sleeping and doing the collage artwork for Helen for the happy august forum swap thing..I'll be getting mine on Monday hopefully if it's sent on time, I have no idea who got me but I'm looking foreward to getting it and finding out who it's from.   I'm getting quite into photography, Helen has given me some tips for beginners and recomended some early cameras to start off with, there are a few on ebay and theres one going quite cheap but it's got a day to go yet. Dad seems quite keen on me getting interested in something like that and he might help to pay for such a thing if it isnt too expensive, it's under £10 for the camera at the moment and it usually goes for around £70/90 so I'll keep a watch on it and see how it goes...
