      I have a cold, and I HATE it! arrgghh...I mean, I work in a call center, and I talk to Americans having problems with their Web Hosting accounts...and it's soooo hard to talk when you have a stuffed nose...I can imaging myself sounding like a   ngongo    over the phone...no wonder the customers have difficulty understanding what the heck I'm saying...  It's a good thing it isn't that cold here in the office. I also noticed that they pulled up the blinds on the window so that we can see rge lights outside the building, which is pretty cool. Looking forward to the sunrise later on...still working on the vampire shift on 9pm till 6am...  Can't think of anything more to say...will update this blog later...

      I've been reading friends' blogs and almost all of them have one thing in common: "Imelda" reviews.  I have heard of the movie from friends, and now I've been reading about it non stop! It's a good thing that it's my rest day tonight and on Friday. I am definitely going to watch that movie this week, hopefully tonight. I'd LOVE to see her fabulous wardrobe...  Sad to say I was not accepted to the position I applied for. That's strike 2 for me! I applied for QA Analyst, and then Tier 2, and I got busted. I can hear my friend saying "YOU SHOULD HAVE FREAKIN' ACCEPTED THE POSITION WHEN IT WAS OFFERED TO YOU!" over and over and over and over...I mean it's like an echo! sheeesh...But hey, no hard feelings. If it's not meant to be, then it's not! hehehe...It doesn't affect me that much. Just the thought that it was offered to me makes me proud they considered me for the position...  In a few more minutes, I'll be logging off! YAHOO! No more American customers screaming in my ears! God this job is TIRING! I mean, u have to listen, and then think, and then type, ALL AT THE SAME TIME. And NO, they don't pay us enough. I know call center representatives have a higher basic pay than most corporate jobs (especially on the entry level), but it is NOT enough. Working in the graveyard shift for 6 months is causing my body to slowly deteriorate. Everyone tells me I'm so skinny...sigh. I know I've written this down before, but I'm going to say it again. I NEED TO BE IN THE MORNING SHIFT!!! (how i wish my supervisor can read this...hahaha!)  Hmmm...I think I'm stressed out. Thank goodness I have officially logged out, and it is now officially my rest day...I survived another 3 days in this forsaken job...  I guess I'm in a bad mood...time to de-stress...Runescape.com here I come!

      I've noticed that in the last couple of days, my humongous appetite has returned. My shift starts at 9pm, and I usually have dinner before I go to work. But by 9:30pm, I'd be hungry as a horse, and I would usually ask anyone on the floor who would go on break to buy me something. I'd have my lunch at around 1:30 am with my honey and then when I'd accompany him outside the building for his smoke, I'd end up going to Ministop for dessert. Sigh. But I haven't gain weight yet, and I am still underweight. I badly need to get off this damn graveyard shift for a few months...  It's ironic that I had just applied for a position here at work that I once turned down. They offered me a position in the Strike Team, who handles supervisor calls and escalations. Being in the first batch in this account (EarthLink Web Hosting), I was in the list for the second batch of Tier 2 people. I turned it down coz I didn't feel like doing extra work with no extra pay. But after I applied for a QA Analyst position and got turned down, I realized that being a Tier 2 makes a difference. One of our new QA Analysts used to be in the Strike Team. Another Strike Team member got promoted to being a trainer. Sigh. I have not yet been interviewed for the position, but I hope that I will get accepted.   My supervisor has given me my 5th month evaluation. Although my performance stats stink, I was assured that I will be regularized. harharhar.  Not much to do here on weekends. Trying to play Runescape but my pc gets slow and it's hard to minimize the window when a call suddenly comes in. Sigh. I'm getting addicted to that freaking game.

      I got chewed out by my supervisor just now. I got a whooping zero on my QA for "professional conduct". Sigh. Apparently, I gave out the wrong answer. I admit I said the wrong thing, though I don't know why I said it. I guess I misunderstood the question. I felt really bad about it, coz I know my supervisor was very disappointed. I just helped my team's QA score to go down to 68%.  &nbsp;  I thought this week was gonna be good, coz my first QA score was 100. Then, I got a wonderful zero. Sigh.  &nbsp;  But then, I admitted my fault and I apologized to my sup. He's a good sup, and I understand he's just trying to handle the team well. I promised I'd do better next time. Sigh.  &nbsp;  I felt like I was a child again, being reprimanded for failing an exam. Sigh. Speaking of family, it's my dad's 47th bday today. Happy birthday dad.  &nbsp;  It's another cold Sunday night here in the office. It's raining outside, and the gloominess of the weather reflects how I am feeling right now. I feel really down though. All these sadness makes me really hungry.&nbsp;

      Somebody actually commented that I have no updates on my blog...(u know who u are!)DUH! Been busy! hehehe...actually, just lazy...and we've been getting a LOT of calls lately that I can hardly take the time to swallow my own saliva...i know that's totally gross but it's true.  Hmm...let's see...My friends (Nell and Eva) and I watched "Mean Girls" last Friday. Cool clothes. Lindsay Lohan was a BABE! God she's so sexy. I felt like I was a guy when I saw her. DAMN! But then, the leading man was oh-so-sexy too...sigh...The movie was short, so we watched it twice...harharhar!  After the movie, Eva went home and Nell treated me to dinner at Teriyaki Boy. Yum.  Planning on getting a tattoo this Friday. Still looking for a design...gonna place it on my lower back.  Can't think of anything more to add...pretty boring this week, mostly work. Gotta go, my break is almost over...ciao

      I didn't go to work last night. Back hurts, and I was so damn sleepy. I think I must've slept for 13 hours last night.   This morning, I woke up at 4am and then couldn't go back to sleep. So I went to the mall, bought some bathing stuff, and went to the salon for my nails. I had only planned on having my nails done, but I ended up with a haircut and hot oil. Talk about unplanned spending!  But the results were nice. My hair was softer (everybody sing!  'sumusunod...sa galaw mo sumusunod, sa galaw mo' ...) and it has more body now...nails looks nice too...they look like human nails now...sigh  Hardly have any calls tonight, it's still a holiday in the US. Good for us...  I am sooo sleepy I think I'll doze off while I'm waiting for a call to come in...sigh...i wanna go back to bed!

      Yesterday, Friday July 2, I watched Spiderman 2 with my friends from my previous job. I waited for them to finish their shift at 3pm and then headed off to Greenbelt 3 for some serious movie watching session and having our long overdue reunion.  * People who have NOT watched Spiderman 2, PLEASE don't read this! *  The movie was...ok I guess. It still had that "wow" factor for the stunts, but I found myself liking the first movie though. What I liked about the second one was the part when his true identity was revealed to his best friends (including MJ) and a few people that he saved on the train. I also liked the ending when MJ chose Peter Parker over her fiance, accepting him for who he was because she loved him like hell. Now, that my dear friends, is LOVE. It's hard to accept a person for who they really are, I mean REALLY accept them, the whole package. Trust me, I've been there...hehehe...  After the movie, the whole tropa headed off to Kroko Grill for some serious bonding sessions. My good friend "N" told us this really disgusting story about her ex bf.   Last week, Sykes held its annual Global Picnic. Around 4,000 Sykes employees headed off to Subic to relax and have fun, for FREE. Her ex bf "J" was there also, along with the rest of our tropa. It was an overnight thing, so there was a lot of drinking on the night they arrived. Stashed, our friend "M" went to their designated bedroom. When she opened the door, she saw "J" in bed with one of their team mates (and she's a team manager for crying our loud). The disgusting thing about it was that they were naked, and my friend "M" almost kicked their asses off the bed (I wish she did tho).  I bet u guys are thinking, hey they're EXS already...I know that, but the thing is he still calls my friend "N" and texts her and tells her he loves her and yes, they STILL go out sometimes. It appears that the girl he slept with on that night (the team manager) said that it was my friend "N" who was chasing this guy "j"...WHAT THE..?! He's the one who keeps texting and calling my friend! And he has the BALLS to do that in our tropa's bedroom! I mean, we accepted this guy into our tropa and he even broke "N"'s heart...and then this? Why can't he pig out in another room? Did he really wanted the tropa to see them together like that?  When I heard the story, I was angry at "J" and the team manager. My friend does not deserve that. I know how she feels, I really do. I wanted to hug her and tell evrything will be alright, but the truth is she won't be for a while. She is hurt, and will be till the wound heals.   I know I shouldn;t be putting stories like this on a blog, but hey I just want to share this story because it really affected me. Sigh.   disgusting...

      Been reading friends' blogs lately, and a new movie is on everyone's lips (or blogs for that matter):  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .  Again, I am curious why this is such a hit right now. Better grab a copy of the movie. Wait, is it showing yet? Or did I miss it (again, just like  Imelda ).  I think I have seen the preview before, starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. I better research on this one. (and hopefully NOT miss it).  I've been feeling down for some time now, so I've been quiet. But things are now starting to look up, and maybe I can go back to my old noisy cheerful crazy self. Cheers!

      I went to SM North Edsa last Friday for the sale. I was there before 10am, and waited for the stores to open. A lot of people were already there, waiting for the opening of the sale. I wasn't really planning on buying clothes, but I passed by  Kamiseta  and there were sooo many people that I decided to see what the heck was going on.  It turned out that they had a 50% discount on all the items, and I mean ALL. People were yanking blouses from their hangers like peeling thorns stuck in your pants. In 20 minutes, most of the clothes were gone. The ones left were those in ridiculous sizes (extra small and extra large). I managed to dig up 2 blouses that were nice and simple, and for half the price! haha!  Next stop,  Penshoppe  just across  Kamis eta. I had this stupid smile on my face when I left  Kamiseta . hehe...I got a cologne from Penshoppe, the one that smelled like pears. Yummy.  Bought  Cosmo  next, and then earrings and then 6 pairs of socks. And then stuff for the bathroom (body scrub, etc). Next was the bookstore. Browsed thru the Anne Rice books and bought a thin paperback by a Filipino author.  No boyfriend since Birth  by Claire Betita is funny and realistic. I found myself reading it thrice in one day. Plus points: only costs P150.  Final stop was the supermarket. Sigh. I was VERY tired when I got home, and I had fever the next morning. Sheesh. And so I didn't go to work Saturday night.  I am so lazy to go to work. It's a Sunday, it's raining, and I have to work nights. Life indeed sucks.  It is so cold in this freaking office that I have so many things wrapped around my body. Jacket, with hood on my head, thick blue blanket from my office friend...I look like a freaking burger! Should've bought a thick jacket...sigh...the pains of not having enough money...so much to buy, so little money...again, life indeed sucks.

      I'm sleepy. I got home at around 9:30am and fell asleep at around 11am. Woke up at 6pm, when my boyfriend came home. Sooooo sleepy and soooooo lazy to go to work. Sigh.  It's a good thing that we don't have a lot of calls coming in tonight. I am sooooo not in the mood.  I finished Memnoch this morning when I got home. The ending sucks.  Bitin! Bad trip!   And so I have finished the fifth book in the series. Time to get the sixth! I think the title is  The Vampire Armand . Creeps. I don't like Armand at all...Louis is ok, but I love, love, love, love Lestat. The second book,  The Vampire Lestat , is one of my favorites. I read it several times already.  Wolfkiller...     I am sooooo looking forward to Friday. It's pay day and there's a 3-day sale in SM North Edsa! WAHOOO! SALE SALE SALE! I love SALES! I'm going to get new socks, new pants, new blouse, new jacket, new bag...sigh. If only I have the money for all those...I'll probably just get the socks and blouse. Another sigh.  I really like this new template. So feminine! =) hehehe...

      I just finished another grueling Monday night shift working in a call center. Since it's a Monday, tons of calls came in, and tons of stress added to my already decaying sleep-lacking body. Total of 51 calls. Sigh.  So here I am sitting in front of my pc at work, waiting for my boyfriend's first break at 7:45. I decided to wait for him and have breakfast together. It's his first day on the morning shift (6am-3pm). I miss him a lot coz our skeds are always conflicting with each other. Imagine, my shift ends at 6am and his shift starts at 6am. Sigh.  I just heard that our schedule shift will be postponed. The Workforce department are going to adjust the priority numbers given to us. I really, really, really, really, REALLY hope I get the freaking morning shift.  Updates on Memnoch: I still haven't finished it. I read a little yesterday morning when I got home. Lestat is back on Earth. Dora has the veil and has gone nuts (to my opinion anyways). I hope to finish it before my rest day on Thursday. It's almost a week now and I haven't finished it yet! That book is driving me crazy, seriously.  On my personal life: I had a dream about my brothers. I have two: one is 11 years old and the other one is 3 years old. The last time I saw them was in June when my paternal grandmother died. Haven't seen them since. Haven't gone home. I'm still in bad terms with my parents. I know they haven't forgiven me for what I did, maybe they never will. It's sad sometimes thinking about it. I mean, if you guys know how close my mom and I were, you'd get sad too. People always thought we were sisters: we'd go shopping together, go to parties together, share gossips with one another over foot spas, grocery shopping every weekend, and back up one another against "enemies". Back in high school, we wore matching black and white clothes for my school's Parent Day. Cool huh? Since that "fight", things were never the same. My mom ignores me when I'm in the house, we don't talk anymore...I don't even feel like she wants to see me in her house. Oh well, such is life. As they say, you can't have everything.  So I made a choice and yes, I'm sticking to that choice. I chose to be here, and here I intend to stay. I just wish that things would get ACCEPTED soon...  I think I need to sleep, I'm getting emotional again. I always have this phase every month. Maybe it's one of those girl things. Hmmm...too early for that, but what the heck...better early than none at all...does that make sense people? Maybe not. My brain is not working anymore. Gotta go...  au revoir...

      I am currently reading the fifith book of the Vampire Chronicles by  urlLink Anne Rice . Now I'm a fast reader and I can usually finish a book in a day if I want to. It is now the third day, and I have yet to finish it! I've only got 200 more pages to go, but I have to stop now and then because it gives me a headache.  Let me try to explain. Anne Rice's character, my beloved Lestat, is being convinced by the devil himself, Memnoch the Fallen Archangel, to assist him to win the battle with God. Rice describes Lestat's journey with Memnoch as the devil showed him Heaven, explained Creation, argued that the battle with God needs to end. It's a headache! I mean, I enjoy the story, but a million questions pop up in my head! I know it's fiction, but it's hard to convince myself that it's not real! Sigh...  I envy Lestat. I wish I could talk to God, like he did. I want to ask him WHY. If He knew all the things that are going to happen, WHY did he let evil crawl on Earth? WHY did He let mankind suffer? All these things, God tried to explain as BEAUTY, as the beauty that lies in the Natural. Hmm...I find myself confused like Lestat. If ever the things Rice said were true...what the heck am I saying?! Damn! Sigh. I'm getting another headache.  I thought  Queen of the Damned  was the best in the Vampire Chronicles...but now, I think Memnoch is more intense, more...scary. I actually find myself sleeping with the lights on last Thursday night.  I love Anne Rice, and I love vampires...my dad used to say I'm abnormal...  I went to National Bookstore, and I actually saw that they had stocks of the ENTIRE Mayfair Witches series! DAMN! Wish they'd still be there on my payday next Friday...harharhar!

      Instead of watching "Imelda", we watched iRobot last Thursday night. It was great! Will Smith is still, to my opinion, one of THE sexiest guy in the planet. His black leather Chuck Taylor shoes inspired me to FINALLY buy my own pair of chuckies. I didn't get the leather ones, though I did try a pair. The original ones are much more comfortable. So we went shopping the day after watching the movie, feeling confident that my ATM is full...and guess what? After shopping for a pair of shoes and undies, I only had 9oo pesos left to spend till the next pay day. Godd luck to me...  The movie was cool. I really love, love and love Will Smith's car. Sooooooo cool. But the concept of robots taking over the world (ala Matrix) really scares the shit out of me. If I'm still alive when robots become a household appliance, I am not going to get one. So many things can go wrong with machines, and I wouldn't risk the safety of my family just for the convenience of it.  Things at work are not going well. My team's QA scores are so disappointing, it's depressing to even talk about. The main reason for our low QA scores is our QA analyst for the month. If he's the QA analyst, don't expect to pass...  On a positive note, I am now a regular employee. Woohoo! Extra pay!  Another negative thing at work. Agents with stats that stink are gonna be separated from the rest of the team. A total of 18 agents will be taken out (like thorns...hehe), and they will be closely monitored by 2 supervisors and several members of the Strike Team (Level 2 agents or Tier2). Agents will be there for 2 weeks, and if their stats improve (AHT and QA scores...sorry for the terms to those who are not call center agents), they will go back to their ordinary schedules. Those 18 agents will be on the 10pm-7am Sat Sun rest day sked...sigh. I can feel that I am one of those agents. Godd luck to me. Hopefully, I will get the morning shift on our next sked shift, which is on Aug 15. Sigh. I chose the 7am-4pm sked. Praying that I get it...I've been on the graveyard shift for 6 months. I WANT TO BE NORMAL!!!  So now my break is over and I need to go back to my  beloved  EarthLink customers. NOT!  Farewell...
