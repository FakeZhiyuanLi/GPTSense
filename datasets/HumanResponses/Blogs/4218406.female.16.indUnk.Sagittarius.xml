         Okay, not a ton to write about, but I might as well get the past few days out of the way.    Everything's cleared up. And I mean -EVERYTHING-. That's pretty awesome and stuff. The only thing I'm sort of regretting is that, since I got all mad and confused, I sort of let loose on people and may have been a -tad- mean. Not uber psycho-bitch like or anything, but the meanest I've been in a while, I think. But as long as everything's all good and fixed. Plus, I think I had -pretty- good reasoning.    I was going through all of my comics last night. I've come to conclude that, if I had the heart to sell all of them, I'd be -SO- rich. I started re-reading the Spawn series, which is purely amazing. I think it should be a ton bigger than it currently is.    I seem to have gotten a new roleplaying buddy, hehe. That'll be pretty fun, considering I kind of quit the only source of roleplaying I had. I was looking to contact some of my old friends to see if they were up for some e-mail rping, but it seems as thought I already found someone! Looking forward to that..    Currently, there are over 16 people at my house. Normally, that would probably mean an orgy; but nope! Erik is holding some poker tournament for funds for my brother's college/wrestling career or something.. I'm not really sure. Regardless, there are quite a few people I know and/or have seen before, so I guess it isn't -TOO- uncomfortable. That also doesn't mean that I want to go up there or anything. They're eating my delicious food! I HAVE TO PEE! Argh.

             So after my little rant thing yesterday, I was getting a little fed up. I sort of flipped out and blocked pretty much everyone because I didn't want to have to keep trying to fix it to no avail. But... They person that played as "Fred" sent me a couple e-mails, and actually let me plead my case. This finally ended in "Fred" believing my side of the story, but haha... He started believing a little too late, don't you say?        "Fred" talked to one of the people who blocked me (I'd consider him a pretty damn good friend, but I just don't know after all of that.) and got him to unblock me, and unban me from the forum; yeah, he banned me from a forum over it. I still haven't talked to him yet, mind you; and I figure I'm going to have a -really- hard time not yelling his ass off. Just.. The fact that he didn't even come to me about it, you know? If you have a problem or hear something that is about me, I'd expect you to come and hear what I have to say before taking any action/hating me.        Even though everything seems as though it's all good and well, I'm still not completely on stable ground with everyone. Though some things have been a tad reinforced.. Fred is going to start coming to me about things, and I'm going to start telling him what I'm thinking/feeling/needing to get out. As for the person who posed as "Jhem"... I'm not sure what to say.        That's it for now, I guess. =P

         You know what I -really- love? Let me explain it..        So.. You've known someone for a pretty long time, right? (Let's call him Fred.) And they start talking to someone else that you may or may not know. (We'll call this person Jhem.) Fred and Jhem start talking for about five minutes, when Jhem decides to say something about you. (It can be true.. But in this case, it's really not.) So Fred, who just met Jhem five minutes ago, hears this and -believes- it. Why? Maybe it has to do with Jhem knowing you, or maybe it has to do with them wanting to learn more about you. Hell if I know.         So Fred, with his newly discovered information, (Which is a pretty dirty piece of information, mind you.) decides he'll tell -everyone- you've ever talked to that he knows about it. So now everyone that you have -ever- talked to believes something that Jhem made up. This little bit of false information ends in terrible collisions and problems within your friendships, and basically ends up with you 1.) Pissed off at both Jhem, Fred, and everyone that believed it and, 2.) Scrambling throughout your life, trying to figure out a way to make it better.        So one of the ways you try to make it better is via telling the truth. On a normal basis, said solution would probably have worked, but Fred and Jhem milked it for -all- it was worth. It didn't work; no one would believe you.        Another solution you tried was trying to ignore the problem. Not the best solution, mind you. Ignoring the problem didn't do -anything- because, well, people are bringing it up all the time now.        So as a final solution, you tried talking to Fred, who can't keep his fat mouth shut, and apparently doesn't realize the hell he's created for you. You try to tell Fred that what he's been saying isn't true, but he just goes on blabbering about how "it's okay, I just thought it would have been better if -you- told me, rather than me hearing it from some other source. I forgive you." That would have been a nice thing to say if it were true but, one again, in this case: it's not.        So now you're trapped in the hell that Fred and Jhem had created for you, struggling to get people to believe -you- and not those two. It's very suprising when it seems as though people you've known forever believe it from them and not you. -VERY- suprising.          ---// Ooo.. I'm done venting. I sort of feel better now. I just have to get a good solution to this problem. At least the only person I -REALLY- care about believes me. Or.. I think so, at least. //---

         I have a lot to say this time, so buckle your seatbelts. ;)    So.. Pretty much everyone I talk to is starting to get on my nerves/piss me off in some way or another/ or -they- have the problem with me. For instance: Every ex I've -ever- had is trying to get back together with me, or is just being really, awkwardly nice. That both pisses me off and puts me in a weird position. For one.. It's done and through.. I'm not really one of the people that goes back after something like that (I'm sure I'll end up bringing the "Rob Catastrophe" at some point or another within this blog.) and sure as hell not by them being creepilishiously nice to me. It's sweet and all that they still care and all, but what matters is that they hurt me before, and lost all trust that I ever had in them. ^^;    I'm always at a loss for words in those sorts of situations, too. Or.. Any situation for that matter. I guess I sort of have a problem with words, and getting things to come out the way that I meant them to? Don't take that the wrong way, though.. I can have a pretty in-depth conversation with someone if the time is right.. It's just I don't really want to have to deal with the past right now, I suppose; what's done is done, and I don't really want to go back to see "what could have happened."    As for what's been going on today: Chelsea was over (second day in a row) and stayed for the majority of the day. I mean... I didn't even say good-bye to her, but she left around 10 pm, I believe. I pretty much played Xbox and tried to slip away from her as much as possible throughout the day, until my brother offered to take me to the batting cages. One of my -favorite- things to do is to go to the batting cages.. Give me a good bat and a few tokens, and I'll be happy for the rest of the day. (Well, not in the case of today. =P)    School's coming up pretty soon... Don't know the exact date, though. Regardless, I think I'm ready to tackle this year. I just want to get through it so that the Summer can come around; I actually have something to look forward to. ^^    -kthxbye         "People always expect other to entertain them. They feel obligated to be active in each other's presence and constantly talk. If you can enjoy a comfortable silence with somebody, then you know there's something amazing between the two of you. "

         First entries are always the sucky part. I could introduce myself, go straight into the part of what I've been doing within the past few days, or I could just talk about how much first entries are the sux. Sooo.. I'll do all of them. ^_^    I made the blog because I.. Have this weird obsession with telling people about my life and to prove how truly boring it is. That, and I wanted to comment on  urlLink Ken's  blog, because he's the best. You also can't forget the part where I have no life, so blogging would -completely- take up part of the endless amount of free time that I have; that's always good, eh?    As for what's been going on in my life at this point, there's not much. Yesterday I enrolled in school and took a tour around the building.. It's -really- old, but that's a good thing for me.. I like older things; I guess they just make me feel more comfortable, *shrug*.    The other day, my brother ended up sending me to the hospital. (I'm fine, by the way. =P) So.. To make up for that, and to be a complete kiss-ass, he took me to see Chronicles of Riddick. (At the dollar theater; he's too cheap to take me to see Napoleon Dynomite.) Before the movie, on the other hand, he took me to Trading Zone. For those of you who don't know what that is.. It's basically a place where you can trade in videogames, cds, and movies and such.. He ended up getting Rainbow Six 3 (Xbox) for me.. So that was pretty cool.    I loves my Ken. ^_^
