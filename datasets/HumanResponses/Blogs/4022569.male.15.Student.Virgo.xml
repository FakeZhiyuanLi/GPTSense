      For to long we talked on the phone. I know I need you cause the loneliness is gone. You know I'm sitting here alone, And I don't want you to go.  Please don't hang up the phone. Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone. Our minds collide, natural tendencies grow. Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone.  I want you sow bad but I cant have you. IM not there's anything I can do. You have no idea what I'm going through. Is the a way to make it work on my own?  Please don't hang up the phone. Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone. Our minds collide, natural tendencies grow. Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone.  Alone, alone, Alone, alo------ne, Alone  Please don't hang up the phone. Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone. Our minds collide, natural tendencies grow. Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone.  For to long we talked on the phone. I know I need you cause the loneliness is gone. Please don't hang up the phone. Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone.

       Only five miles from home now,   Tryin' to forget about,    The love I'm wishin' I coulda' done without.   It's hard to say I'll be ok,   The truth is I'm reelin' of all this pain and I know why.      'Cause sometimes we all need a little love life.      All our hearts go through joy and strife.    But,   I wanna be your shining light!   Be the first star you see at night!   Just say that you'll be my love life!       Kept prayin I didn't need you.   Kept hoping I was right.   I wish you knew you're still my mind.   I guess it's something you left behind.   maybe we're meant to be this time.      'Cause sometimes we all need a little love life. All our hearts go through joy and strife. But, I wanna be your shining light! Be the first star you see at night! Just say that you'll be my love life!       Ohhhhh love life, a little love li----ife       Maybe someday I'll see,    That you were just playin' me,   This won't last,   It's over its passed,    And I placed last,       'Cause sometimes we all need a little love life.   All our hearts go through joy and strife.    But I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time!   Known you weren't going to love me right!   That's why this my love life my love life!       Ohhhhh love life, a little love li----ife

      Verse 1:  I found it, We're Changing. I've seen you, You're breaking. Not that I've never seen it before. It's just I have never seen it close so many doors.  Verse 2:  It's morning, The day is calling. I'm empty, And loveless. Can't take back what I said. There are so many doubts in my head.  Chorus:  Lately its not hard to find, memories you left behind. For that ten thousand years I have been look for love that was true. Lately I've lost you.  Bridge:  Looking around, Trying to count, People I need. I found out, Beyond a shadow of doubt, There's only one I couldn't live without!  REPEAT CHORUS 2X  Close:  Lately, I found I, I'm breaking.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night&nbsp;I was up until about 3:00 AM searching for an entry level record company.&nbsp;I found one called Octone records. They handle acts like maroon&nbsp;5 and some others that&nbsp;I have never heard of.&nbsp;Though officially maroon&nbsp;5 is singed with J-Records, they started at Octone Records.&nbsp;I read their article on what they want to include in your demo package. That includes, a CD/tape/vhs, influences, contact info, a list of songs on the CD/tape/vhs. I hope to someday soon send in a demo.&nbsp;If it works out great! If not it's still fun to to have tried.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also&nbsp;I went looking for information on how a recording contract works.&nbsp;I found an article&nbsp; written by&nbsp;an entertainment attorney on some of the technicalities of a contract. All&nbsp;I know is there is a lot to know about&nbsp;how contracts work. Stuff like&nbsp;recoupment, royalty points, and some&nbsp;incumbent collateral thing that involved a lot of other enormous words.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Ok, so right now, because of my parents divorce we are building a new house. Here are&nbsp;the top 10 favorite things about the house.    It is back on the other side of town where most of my friends are.  Its got vaulted ceilings.  I&nbsp;get my&nbsp;own room downstairs.  I get my own bathroom.  The kitchen has a big island in the center.   The has a big island in the center.  the deck is two feet bigger than it was supposed to be (thanks to a lack of math skills by the deck builder).  My&nbsp;bathroom will have a jacuzzi tub, and a separate shower.  Its wired for in wall stereo throughout the whole house.  As it&nbsp;stands right now we are going to have a hot tub in the basement.   Kramer, out!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Last night and into the morning was the cast party for our summer theatre production of "Get Smart." The first part of it was lame. Chase busting out his much over done paino songs, and me doing the same on our guitar. I think&nbsp;he and&nbsp;I do that because we know we can preform those songs the best.&nbsp;Then&nbsp;the party moved to Craig Bailey's (a friend of Chase). Eventually that turned into a movie marathon upstairs and a&nbsp;DDR party downstairs.&nbsp;I havenever palyed DDR before so it was only a matter of time before&nbsp;I found how incredibly addicting that game is. Between games of DDR&nbsp;I would randomly stroll up to the kitchen only to find so suttly ass girl&nbsp;taking of her clothes. Unfortunately she had a crush on me which is just sad.&nbsp;It's kinda of funny because she told she had a crush on me&nbsp;two nights before.&nbsp;I didnt want to hurt her feelings so i just changed the subject (Somthing about me wanting another Cherry Coke).&nbsp;I got away from that without hurting anyone. As far as the cast party goes it was one of the best&nbsp;I have ever been to. Even though Chase and&nbsp;I ended up going home because we were very tired and we knew there was no way we were going to beat "Crazy Asian Kyle" at DDR&nbsp;    &nbsp;  Kramer, Out!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                Hokay. So here's da' deal. My mom likes to yell for no apparent reason....A lot...And yeah. So anyway today chase and I were moving things around the house to help get unpacked. Moving is not fun...At all, so of course we complain. And today that toilet over flowed and the rug got wet. I was not informed of this. My mom told me to pick up the rug, I said its just wet from the shower. RESULT: EXPLOSION! Chase came up stairs to defend me because mom didn't tell me got dirty water from the toilet. And then a huge argument ensued that resulted in chase leaving and then mom ranting about how much everyone sucks and then she turned on me for a second. I decided to go look for recording equipment online to keep out of my moms hair.            The rest of the day went as follows. We went over to Craig's to watch Resident Evil which was a relatively good movie. After hanging out there I had a bunch of people to bring home so we went to Weeza's to split them up into smaller groups. We left after about a half an hour to bring nick home and then head home our selves. Now before leaving Weeza's we decided that chase would drive because he's 18 and it was past curfew. So of course we get pulled over for careless driving right in front of my house. But, thanks to god I was not driving, or I would have gotten the 94 dollar ticket, and an 88 dollar curfew ticket. We haven't told my mom about it yet we thought that was the last thing she needed today. And that leads me right up to this post. So....dat's it....No more.  Kramer, Out!

      Today I was asked to babysit two kids of a friends of my moms. I have never babysat before. I now realize why they call it babysitting. There are the youngsters who normally go to bed well before their parents get home. The sitting comes into play after bedtime. Basically after putting them to bed I grabbed a soda and some other snacks out of the fridge, and told the kids if they needed anything that I would be downstairs. I headed down to watch TV, drink, eat (and be marry) and got paid to do it. I was there from about eight to a bit after twelve, and walked away with three crisp twenties in my back pocket ( that is about $15 an hour in comparison to hy-vee $5.75 an hour) . All in all I don't think I'll mind the next time I get called to babysit by them.  Kramer, Out!

      I woke up this morning knowing it was going to be another day of moving things from one place to another place where they are still in the way. Then my moms phone rang and chase picked it up to run it out to mom. The phone call remained a mystery to chase and I. All we knew was that it was a hell of a lot of bad news. When mom finally told us the bad news. I couldn't believe what I heard. My sister in-law has condition with eyes that at some point here retina may detach and if not treated before it separates she will be blind. Prior to this phone I didn't have a clue she had any eye problems. All these images of heather walking down the street with a blind person's cane. I think things will be ok and they will be able to treat it at the hospital. Right now I know I should be crying but I'm not because I when I cry that means its hopeless. What I'm saying is that if heather is still seeing light in her tunnel then why should the light at the end of the tunnel already be out? All in all I didn't see it coming and ironically someone I'm sure someone can see the way out.

      I really didn't do much today that was interesting, I woke up to find one of the builders in my house. Boy will I be glad when they are not allowed in anymore. Anyway I read a note that said I needed black pants for my show choir retreat tomorrow and told my mom about it and I went to go get pants, but of course we left the store with a lot of other items. I came home ate and got tons of other things unpacked. Then after hanging around my house for awhile Sean came over with Allison and we pretty much drove around and listened to show tunes. I know I know, it sounds boring but it's really fun. We just listened to Little shop of horrors and its was very strange that I could still remember a lot of the choreography, I remember sitting in green room playing cards trying to figure out why the intercom wouldn't work. If your are not in theatre you are missing out. There is such a rush when you make your first entrance, or delivering the punch-line. The shows make all the work worth it. I truly honestly pray to god our theatre department continues to thrive and keep its reputation as the best drama department in town.

      I know its hard for people to really grasp a concept. The truth is that concepts are easy to grasp. What is hard is to grasp one concept the same way. I really don't mind things the way they are. So why am I so worried about changing them.

      Ok this is very simple you see. In more recent posts I have mentioned my attraction to my best friend Lydia. Well that should have been simple enough. She had said she had a crush on me before, and when flirting began to move to a bit more obvious level I had to wonder does she like me then I realized you can't ask that question if you don't like them thus I succumb to that fact that I was yet again smitten with some hidden, one-sided romance with my best friend. There's nothing wrong with her she's gorgeous, smart, an awesome listener, and talker, and loads of fun just to be with. Ok so this is the part that should be simple. Lydia's X boyfriend has lied to her, numerous things she told him not to (i.e. drugs,and alcohol) broken up with her multiple times causing her to call me late at night crying. And all those times I thought to my self, "The difference between him and me is that I could actually love you." I can't see What it is about him, But if it's just the fact that she's already comfortable with him that's a lame reason. I don't what to do cause this time it's not as easy as the first. I fall asleep thinking of her. I wake just find my self tangled up in thoughts about her and I wonder if she's waking up then too.  Moral: Behind every  simple attraction  there is a complicated relationship.  Kramer, Out!

       This proves it! I am a loser! The last girlfriend I had was in the fifth grade and lasted a total of a week. Now I like to obsess over girls I can't have. Writing songs, and relating anything that could be related to her to her. And everyone says that's really sweet but if that's so I must be A: ugly, B: naive C: in need of lower standards, or D: all of the above.
