        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I was at Utica Square last night, like every Thursday night, and it was mucho fun!&nbsp; Like at first things went kinda slow, but then everyone split from each other, I went somewhere with Patrick, and then Candace, Jackie, and Callie went somewhere else, later on I find out they were trying to find us.. but anyway, back to Patrick.&nbsp; We went into a lot of different stores, held hands, you know.. that kinda stuff.&nbsp; Then we walked to someplace.. I don't even know where, and&nbsp;we kissed, then we walked back to everyone else.&nbsp; I met, er.. Katy?&nbsp; Patrick's like old lover or something, I dunno what she was, but I met her.&nbsp; She said she just wanted to meet Patrick's girlfriend, and I have no idea when I became that, I don't remember these simple words, "Wanna go out with me?"&nbsp; Never, never do I remember hearing, or reading them.&nbsp; But if I'm his girlfriend then like, what happened between me and Jake, and Candace and Jake, and Madison and Jake is kinda.. BLEH!&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Hahaha, only funny thing at Utica Square though was that, a couple of us had to kiss another girl >.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I had Jackie over to spend the night, we swam and I figured out how long I can hold my breath.&nbsp; 1 minute, 30 seconds.. Yeah, that's right, I can hold my breath for that long.&nbsp; Haha, but that's really all that I have to tell..&nbsp; I'll chat ya up later!

I think we are kinda something, but I'm not sure!&nbsp; Anyway, after that Madison, Candace, and I got pizza, ate it all.. we were way beyond hungry.&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So to break this down, sweet and short, I had a kick ass couple of days.&nbsp; I'll chat ya up later!

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp;today went by pretty slow for me.&nbsp; Woke up at around 9:00 to do my hair, makeup, clothes, then I went to church to acolyte.&nbsp; Haha, I learned a new trick: "How to sleep with my eyes open."&nbsp; I did that while the guy was giving a sermon.&nbsp; Btw, his sermon was completely pointless, like, I didn't know where he was going with it.&nbsp; Anyway, after that I came home and sat on the couch and like passed out.&nbsp; I was soooo way beyond tired.&nbsp; Madison and I tried to go to sleep at like 12:30, but then we wanted popsicles, so we got those, and then we were wired.&nbsp; Like it just came out of nowhere.&nbsp; We threw beeny-babies at my door to try to get it shut, and the next morning my mom walked upstairs and was like, "What the hell?&nbsp; Why are here beeny-babies in the hall?"&nbsp; Haha, it was so funny.&nbsp; And then Madison wrestled with me because she wanted me to go get more popsicles right after I had just come back from downstairs because I got a cup of water.&nbsp; She kept tickling and pinching me with her feet until either:     A.) Shut the door    B.) Got popsicles    C.) Shut the door and got popsicles    it was a very eventful night because we kept laughing and stuff, but anyway.. what to post.    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I had Otter (Michael) and Candace over today to swim with me and Mads.&nbsp; Much fun.&nbsp; Otter leaves for camp tomorrow, so sad.&nbsp; Almost all of Mads' other best friends are leaving for camp, while mine are staying in town!!&nbsp; Haha, in her face!&nbsp; But yeah.. We tried to get Otter to play spoons, its sooo funny how we play.&nbsp; I'll be sitting behind Otter, he will hit Candace on the head with a spoon, and then candace will be like, "1... 2... 3...[bam!]"&nbsp; And I would be the one to hit him on the head with a spoon so it would hurt.&nbsp; We also&nbsp;got into a water fight with the hose at first, and water balloons, and then we all jumped in the pool.&nbsp; It was so much fun.&nbsp; And then Madison had this horrible craving for corndogs, so my mom was going to the store to get some stuff and she got her corndogs.&nbsp; There was originally 24, there is now like 10.. all because of her. &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So anyway, that was pretty much my day.&nbsp; Who knows, there might be more tonight.&nbsp; Madison is staying the night again for the 13th time in a row, and Candace might be staying the night too, but who knows.&nbsp; This is gonna be some party :P&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll chat ya up later!

         So, I don't know what exactly I'm doing here, but my friend JJ got me interested in this whole site thingy.&nbsp; Anyways, I'm Caitlin, also known as Landian, Fishy, or Minow.&nbsp; Er, I'm a 14 year old girl who currently lives in Oklahoma, at least the last time I checked I did.&nbsp; I have 2 older brothers, Matt (20 years of age) and John (17 years&nbsp; of age), and most of the time I can't stand either of them!&nbsp; Well, I'm thinkin I'm going to post a picture on my next post because this computer won't let me, since it's stupid and a piece of crap!!!&nbsp; ANYWAYS!&nbsp; There is absolutely nothing to post in this thing right now.&nbsp; Nothing important has happened to me lately.&nbsp; Well actually, come to think of it, something has.  &nbsp;          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Ok, so like, one of my good 'ol friends Jake R. was at Utica Square when I went with Mads, and I hadn't seen him in FOREVER!&nbsp; No joke, almost 6 years, and I saw Murray, or.. yeah, something like that.&nbsp; I don't remember his name or how to spell it.&nbsp; Utica Square is officially the place to be on Thursday&nbsp;nights.&nbsp; I'm going everytime now, at least when I can make it!&nbsp; It's so much fun, haha I got home and&nbsp;I had dirt in my hair from when Jake&nbsp;tackled me, and me and JJ were laying in the&nbsp;grass.&nbsp; OOO!&nbsp;&nbsp; And I saw Papi, Pat, Patrick S.&nbsp;whatever you want to call him, there!&nbsp; But I didn't get to talk to him because, well... I don't&nbsp;know?&nbsp; And one more thing, I think all the Carver/Booker T. Washington people are warming up to me.&nbsp; They used to think I was a bitch because at Kelsey's party I was way WAY tired, like I could barely stand up, and I felt sick, and i was FREEZING!&nbsp;&nbsp; And at the Carver Prom, my stomach was killing me because of cramps, so I didn't want to dance or do anything, and when Eric kept forcing me to dance I got pissy.&nbsp; So to all the Carver/Booker T. Washington people, you know I'm not usually like that, I swear.&nbsp; You guys just caught me on bad nights. &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, so maybe I didn have alot to say.&nbsp; I'm just one of those unpredictable girls most of the time that will suddenly think of something to say, and say it!&nbsp; Muahahaha!&nbsp; >=D&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I am evil.. evil fairy princess.&nbsp; Lolz, anyways... I'll chat ya up later!
