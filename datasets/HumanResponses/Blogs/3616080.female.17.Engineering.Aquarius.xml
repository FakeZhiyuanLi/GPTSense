        WWAAAAAAA!!! I'll be gone after 9 days from now! I haven't entirely packed the bag(s)yet. I'm going to miss home badly, especially when knowing I wouldn't be able to watch KONSERT AKADEMI FANTASIA anymore! This week is the last chance for me to win two tickets to the concert~ I really want those tickets! I've never been to any concerts before, and this is the first local concert I'd like to experience. But well, if it's fated that I'm not going to the concert this Saturday, I just have to accept it. =( Sad though. Anyway, Grace came back on Sunday. She called me on Monday night, while I was stuffing my stomach with the usual amount of fats. She did ask me out, but my mom wouldn't let me ride with friends who drive. This rule sucks. Until I get my own licence and until I turn 20++, I'm not allowed to ride with friends. Grace met up with Khairi and Archana at the usual place, Sunway Pyramid. Khairi told me. He tells me everything! Even the unimportant things. =) I feel honoured because not everyone would tell me EVERYTHING~ I feel like those stuffs people keep filling me in are making me more lively- you know, since I'm quite dull and all. They accompany me a lot. I found friends through the internet, and most of them still keep in touch with me. We share loads of freaking crazy stuffs, especially jokes. Okay, enough. I MISS GRACE!!! I want to meet her before she goes to Australia! Tommorow's her last day! ;(

        I watched TV the whole day through today. Couldn't stop thinking about tonight's Akademi Fantasia's Concert. Well, the elimination was a real sad time. Especially when Edlin was actually improving her vocal on stage tonight. And the most touching part was, Anding actually said " I sayang you..." Aaahhh... So sweet!!! And really touching too. Anding really cried like crazy just now. I know how terrible it feels like when you lose someone special to you. (tsk tsk) I want to watch tommorow's Imbasan Akademi Fantasia. Hope the hours tick quickly. I'm keen to watch the students this monday. They're so talented, really have the spirit of Akademi Fantasia, and they're far better of than the first season's students. Seriously. Here I enclose Edlin's picture from the second week's concert.

        Last few days, absolutely nothing special happened. I downloaded a few songs, and have been playing online games as often as possible. Last night, I chat with a few people on msn. Xiong Ie reminded me there's a match last night. Thank God he did, or else my eyes would be wide open the whole night in bed. I watched the match in my parents' room. Portugal vs. England. Of course I have my faith on England, man, who wouldn't? Good thing I didn't have my "money" on the team. The first half was kind of interesting, Owen scored his first and last goal in this season's EURO at the 3rd minute. The next half was thrilling. Portugal managed to score their revenge goal by Postiga. Figo didn't score any, 3 times, he failed to score. Guess the ball just wouldn't bow to him. Anyway, they were given 30 minutes of extra time. Ended up each team scored a goal. The most sucky part was Beckham's penalty kick. I knew he shouldn't be given the chance! He stinks~ The ball didn't like him either. Portugal scored 6 penalties, England 5. I know nobody's interested in my updates. I'm just reporting for my blog. I have another 14 days till I go to UTP. Feel sad, and I'm a bit nervous too. I'll be missing the tv, formula one especially, and AKADEMI FANTASIA 2!!! I really want to watch tv! Guess this is why they said I have to sacrifice a lot in life to achieve success. Didn't know tv was one of it! I wonder how I would live without watching my line-ups and must-watch-events! I swear, I'll buy a big screen tv once I'm successful in the future!!! Big screen, with sound system surrounding my living room, and a cozy Ossim massage chair. AAAHHH... How beautiful life is~

        Last night I went to bed after watching DIARI AKADEMI FANTASIA at half past midnight. I lied on the bed for about 30 minutes, then got up and turned on the computer again. Listened to a few songs, went back to bed at 1.30 am, and lied on the bed, tossing and turning around for quite a long time. I guess I must have blacked out around 3. My mom woke me up early today. 11 in the morning. Yesterday I told her I wanted to go to Subang Parade today, so she woke me up. Didn't wake up straight away after her first call, instead, I closed my eyes till she called for the hundredth time. Sleepily, I sat up at the edge of the bed, walked to my mom's bathroom (my toothbrush is there- don't ask why). Yada3, then showered at my room, got ready, yelled at my sis a few times, she didn't wake up, then waited for her downstairs. Today, we had lunch at the "Syed Restaurant". My mom and I ordered BRIYANI BUKHARA AYAM each, my dad and sis ordered BRIYANI DAGING each, and guess what? None of us finished our meals except my mom~ I bet she won't be having dinner tonight. From SYED, we went off to SUBANG PARADE. I thought we were just browsing stuffs, coz my mom said so. Turned out, she bought me a set of crimson coloured single bedsheet at the PARKSON GRAND, and a pair of slippers with patterns of red flowers for me to bring to UTP (UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY PETRONAS- *TORONTO*, PERAK).  After we shopped, we went to see a show at the groundfloor. Today, they're having the "ORANG ASLI"(MALAYSIAN NATIVES) show. We watched the "TARIAN SEWANG"(TRADITIONAL MALAYSIAN NATIVES' DANCE). Then we walked around the groundfloor, browsing for nice clothes, and of course, didn't buy any. We went straight home, watched CSI for one hour, then I came upstairs, writing- or shall I say typing this blog. I'm listening to FUEL'S FALLS ON ME right now. Cool song. I'm going to download more songs. Tonight I'm going to watch KONSERT AKADEMI FANTASIA 2!!! Hope the best "LADY" wins~ ahahhaha...

        I wanna start from last night. I went to bed early after chatting with Eja and Afi- both didn't have fun stuffs to talk bout. I was darn bored since last night! Have nothing fun to do, went to bed as early as 1 am, but ended up sleeping after 3. Know why? My parents' room was steaming hot!!! This week I've been sleeping with my mom, coz my dad went to Penang, he just came back just now, around 6 pm... The cleaner came early this morning, lucky me I didn't have to wake up and open the door for her. My sis did- I think. My sis took my phone today, coz her's is still under the oOOoOoRT'S EXPRESS at the time square's theme park. The customer service staffs couldn't find it I guess. This morning was cool. My parents' windows were open, and the cold breeze of morning rain blew in... It was so comfy, I didn't wanna wake up till noon. As usual, woke up, went downstairs, turned on the TV, the fan, sat on the couch, flipped through the channels, and went back upstairs, made the bed, peed, pood, brushed my teeth, washed my face, went back downstairs, do the laundry, washed the dishes, the unitar called, said they're offering me a place there, I said "I already get another offer, and I'm accepting it, thank you." Then my mom came home, we watched the bloody TV, Hayyan came by with her gorgeous friend, talked, watched THE BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL, then they went home, I kept on stuck in front of the TV, watching boring stuffs, abang Helmi called, said he's done filling in my petronas contract forms, and that I could go claim them this weekend. Then my dad came home, he brought stuffs from Penang, I didn't bother to look, went upstairs, get online, and here I am writing my blog. Toninght, wanna watch same old boring shows, and go to bed late, I think, and start tommorow with the same old boring routine of mine. Care to cheer me up? Anybody? Please? Naahh... forget it. I'm pathetic~

(",) i met a lot of new faces, different kind of individuals, from various states, from different part of the world, (iran, yaman, turkmenistan, mozambique, vietnam, pakistan, thailand, indonesia, egypt, s.africa,&nbsp;etc...) and tell you what... by the end of the first week, i've talked to most of the international students in&nbsp;our batch... i had a wonderful week... i was the scriptwriter for our platoon E's phantomime, and i was the background voice of the goat... it was cool... i helped direct the phantomime too... actually, we totally were out of ideas for the story line... it was supposed to be a disaster, until our beloved facilitator and media advisor, MR WAN ABDUL HALIM budge in and help us with our story line... we&nbsp;(khairi- platoon leader, akmal- prop, moses-&nbsp;media director, hafiz- supposed to be my assistant, aini- another last minute assistant, abang halim, and me) spent the wednesday night planning the phantomime for the malam seri kenangan(MSK)... we stayed in the bilik jubah at the main hall till 2.15 am... crazy, huh? but we managed to finish it up by that very night... of course, the next day, everyone came to the hall with tired eyes... but it was worth it... know why? though we didnt have time to practice for the phantomime, after being scolded by the medtech people on friday, (coz our rehearsal sucked) we had about&nbsp;3 hours to practice and prepare for the evening's show... since everyone was so co-operative, we managed to prepare the props as well as practiced within 3 hours  ONLY ... and that evening, our play was a blast!!! we managed to get the audience laugh and enjoy our phantomime, although it was kind of a havoc backstage... everyone was satisfied... i announce our special thanks to abang halim (for the story line), abang aizat (for helping us practice in the multipurpose hall- behind main hall), and kak adlin (for accompanying me when i was alone with the guys)... after MSK, we had sports day on saturday... i played badminton at first, but had to give it up coz i wasnt feeling very well... forced to ask for reserved player... felt real bad for that... i felt like i'm a hypocrit or something... well, that night however, we had the MAS closing ceremony... it was real sad to have the week pass by so quickly and yet so enjoyable... we felt like we want the MAS to go on forever!!! but we have to start studying as well... or else, we'll never graduate! the facilitators said we're the best batch they've ever conduct- though we bet they say that everytime... they performed Dungga together on stage... and they sang for us "love united"... really touching~ i felt like crying!!! that night we have lots of photo shots... that was the last time we met abang halim... he's graduating next month... he must be really excited... oh yeah.. he's a mechanical engineering student as well....     the second week comes... which is the first week of lecture... have to admit, damn tiring, especially we have to choose our own lab and tutorial classes... our schedule is packed, but i managed to have free periods to relax and do some revisions... rizzat and i planned to go back to kl together... he said his other guy friends also planned to go back to kl together... so i asked the other kl girls, wether they want to go back to kl together... so we all decided to go home together... the guys are really caring... they bought the tickets for us... looked after us although it's just a few hours... i appreciate it... i got to know a few more guys... though not everyone, but they're easy to get along with... we started the journey at 7 p.m, arrived at pudu at 9.30 p.m (imagine how fast the bus driver was), mun and i went to the putra station, met mazreen out of nowhere, then we took the ktm from kl central... mazreen and i went back to subang jaya, mun to kepong(her house's in selayang)... the guys? they decided to have dinner first... they planned to go back to utp by bus, but mun and i are going home at 10 a.m. today, (sunday 25th july) by car... mun's coming to subang jaya... we'll go to utp from here... that's all for now... DUNGGA~     p/s: "ARE YOU HOT???!!!"

        I'm so sad! The day has come for me to leave. Tommorow evening, I would wave and kiss goodbye to my precious hometown. *tsk* Tonight is the last night I'm online before I go to Perak. To those who read this blog, I want to say that I'm so sorry if I ever offended you, and that I'll miss all of those who've been in my life, lightened up my days, and chanted jokes to make me smile and laugh. Thanks for everything, and hope to see all of you after my mission has completed! I did mention I wanted to post a picture, sorry, I forgot. I decided not to, since I'm lazy now. I've packed my stuffs, my luggage is totally full and can't fit anything else! It feels like I'm moving out forever! It's just so sad! I wish I don't have to go so far from home. I wish UTP was just in Putrajaya like Hanim thought it is. I'm going to miss Hanim so much! And I'm going to miss my family. Now my mom wouldn't have anyone to scold. I wonder how her days would be like without me around to come up with trouble. I wonder how would she do the laundry alone, and how would she watch the Bold and the Beautiful without me. I'm going to miss doing stuffs with my mom. I'm going to miss teasing my sister and pissing her off. I'm going to miss using my brother's computer late at night. I'm going to miss not opening the door for both my father and brother when they come home. That's all I guess. Till then!

        I'll be gone in 5 days~ I've been counting down the days since last month!!! This is so damn freaky. I haven't been to any place far from home, my favourite tv, Subang Jaya, Sunway Pyramid... KLCC!!! GOD!!! I've never been far from my family for more than 3 days~ I've never not-watch tv for more than 12 HOURS!!! The worst part is, I DON'T WANT TO MISS WATCHING AKADEMI FANTASIA 2!!! Before this, I was excited I'm finally going to university! But now, it's totally different!!! I feel like I'm still not ready for it~ I feel like I want to stay home forever! =(  EURO 2004'S FINAL IS IN 20 minutes from the second I typed "20". PORTUGAL vs. GREECE. Guess I'm going for Portugal. They did bring the English team down on the quaterfinals. Should be a great game tonight. I blacked out during the Formula One race just now!!! I cant believe it! I've never done that before! I'd watch the whole race till the end! Damn it~ I heard Button didn't make it to the podium. My bro dozed off too! He just watched the ending. Frustrating man. Actually, this afternoon my mom thought she wanted to go for grocery shopping at Giant, but cancelled at the last minute. I'm lazy to change. I want to sleep in my jeans tonight. Oh wait. I'm not going to sleep before the game ends. HAAHHA. I'm posting an image of the university I'm going to. UTP, TORONTO, PERAK. =P
