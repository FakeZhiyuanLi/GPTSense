        Public service announcement:  Before reading this article please determine whether or not you support Bush. If you do, run away far from this blog because you  will  be highly offended. If not read on and swig a beer because the truth will be told. Frankly I don't support any politician, I just like to ridicule the bad ones.   Yesterday I was aimlessly browsing the web, because I really have nothing better to do at work, and discovered the background information for Bush's plan to finish liberating Iraq (and gain a few votes in the mean time). Now my first question was, "Why is Bush reporting this from  urlLink Carlisle, PA ?" Does he need to go on the drag strip in order to gain the confidence to report this bauble of a plan.   My next observation from this plan was, "Why didn't he think of a plan when he first invaded Iraq?" Chicken before the egg syndrome, I suppose. Shouldn't the long term plan be thought out prior to the start of a any war meant to liberate a country of mass destruction?   Here are the steps mentioned previously with my own personal dialogue:    1. Handing over authority to a sovereign Iraqi government   Nice idea but we saw what happened the first time   2. Establishing security   As in social security, cause otherwise they don't know the meaning of the word. How do you establish security in a desert with no borders?   3. Continuing to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure   No comment.   4. Encouraging more international support   Yeah, from like France or maybe North Korea. They all hate us let's just get used to it.   5. Moving toward a national election in Iraq that "will bring forward new leaders empowered by the Iraqi people."   Didn't they just assassinate the leader elected? Maybe Bush should run for that election.   Well besides the fact that these steps sound more like a prayer than a strategic plan, I don't think they will influence the structure of Iraq, Bush's re-election, or the will to stop smoking.   South Jersey Girl signing off, possibly forever if the FCC sees this :) Free speech forever baby!

      Bear with me on this folks. This is the first official blog I have ever written and I hope it will be "all it can be" or "an army of one" whatever is better these days.  Now back to business. Dentists are the devil. Unfortunately I graced the office of a local dentist for the first time in 2 years yesterday, my mistake. After graduating college your teeth become less of a priority (usually food and alcohol still take precedence).  Well, after telling me that I need braces (duh) and  urlLink tooth bleaching/whitening  (which is the basic reason I came to the dentist) he squashed what was left of my ego with the fact that I have 6-8 cavities. How does someone suddenly get that many cavities?! I brush, floss and brush again, as much as recommended by the  urlLink ADA , but it is still not enough. What does a Jersey girl have to do. Please no Jersey jokes, I've heard them all.   Up to the age of 20 I had one cavity. Just one and now I find out my family has a history of bad teeth (not like the British) as in root canals, cavities and the need for extra fluoride washes, fun.   Well the moral of the story kids is you can exercise and eat a balanced meal everyday but the dentist is still going to get you. I will soon have a new beautiful smile, like I needed it any better, for just under $5,000. Isn't America great.

       Well, I finally ended my long torture as an editorial assitant for a two-bit marketing company. I do have to say that my lay-off was expected and welcomed. You see for the past few months my former employer had taken business speak to a new level. Not only was the company "in a transition" but it was also going down hill. We were supposed to "be a team player" which meant buying into a false hope. It really does remind me of that Dave & Busters commercial where the guy is stuck in perpetual business speak and nothing is ever a concrete response. I didn't believe I would ever live in that kind of world but I have survived.   Now my days are full of running, working my part-time job from hell, re-learning my 7th grade algebra (for the GRE), and entertaining my pomeranian Ibby. Life is better but not quite fulfilled. The job market in Philly sucks and I don't particularly like the idea of underachieving. I want to work, not hard but just enough to give myself a sense of confidence again. I've plotted and planned every facet of my life until now, and this lifestyle is a bit uncomfortable. I can't decide what I want to be when I grow up, or in other words what the world will let me become. This sounds very abstract but true. I am sure there are plenty of people out there that are redefining their role in society for the umpteenth time as well. Professional pole vaulting  is a good idea but only if I grow 4 more inches tall. What is a petite blondish farm girl to do.   Anyway, conclusion of this post is "Never say Die".

      I am studying to take the GRE this month, which means taking that expensive Kaplan prep class. I believe that the class does help, a little, but am left with the feeling that I could have taken this test better in 7th grade. Why do they give me math I didn't learn in college? English majors don't need math, we need to read detailed novels and come up with worthless explanations of what the author should have meant. All this to get a  urlLink Masters degree  in Journalism. This blog should be my test, scored by how many view it (SEX, SEX , SEX). Now that should increase my score a little.  On another note,  urlLink Comedy Central finally dumps "The Man Show".  What a relief, ever since Jimmy and Adam left the show it has been nothing but a graphic mouthpiece for losers without girlfriends. The fear factor guy may be hot but he is not hot enough to carry the show. That said, watch the Chappelle Show, it's funnier and much better written.

      It's official, I have stepped into the 20th century of cars. Friday I made the purchase of a chili pepper red  urlLink 1998 Jeep Cherokee Sport Classic.   Not only does it drive smoother and faster than my 1987 Chevy Blazer, may it rest in peace, but it has so many cool gadgets I've never experienced, for instance, no chirping noises from the back, cruise control that doesn't decelerate on hills,  190 HP vs. 100 HP, and last but not least a stereo that plays CDs. Amazing huh. In addition, now I have the ability to conquer those elusive parking lot curbs!  In other news I just read today that Dave Chappelle is going to play Rick James in an upcoming autobiographical movie  urlLink "Memoirs of a Super Freak".  It is amazing how they come up with these things. Personally, I think Dave Chappelle has a great impersonation of Rick James but he is a bit too skinny. Maybe they'll use Eddie Murphy's brother in the story line.

      Anyone would think that having a job that requires nothing of you all day is a wonderful opportunity. That was, at first, my line of thought and then, as the months passed, I began to realize how crippling boredom really is. It sucks away any motivation for  urlLink job searching ,  urlLink computer games ,  urlLink blog writing , and  urlLink laughing at all my working friends . All the joys of life are just taken away. I crave a new job with responsibilities and meaning. No more two hour lunches or solitaire for this non-working editorial assistant.   Now I do want my readers to understand that the reason for my boredom is not laziness. Apparently, that might sound more believable but the real reason is I was suckered into a company on the down-hill. Unfortunately, the "down-sizing" company will not admit its defeat and quietly sink into oblivion. No, it has taken business speak to a new level. The very few employees still hanging on, waiting/begging for the ax, are condemned to mindless days of no work and little else to do but lose our minds. That, my friends, is the reason for the birth of this blog.

      How many times have you seen a girl in the gym with two 3lb weights doing dumbbell curls, the anorexic cardio girl on the stairmaster, or the girl in the weight room reading  urlLink  Shape Magazine   as she lifts the 45lb bar off the bench (okay maybe reading and benching does take  some  talent). But my point is that there are so many women/girls out there that don't have a clue how to lift weights and are more concerned with the term getting "toned". Let me tell you right now, and listen carefully stripper girl in the pink jumpsuit, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS GETTING TONED. You either lift and lose body fat increasing lean muscle mass or you break down muscle mass replacing it with air (like everyone's favorite supermodel  urlLink Gisele Budchen ).   My first and foremost pet-peeve is magazines that support the myth "if women lift weights they will look like the Incredible Hulk". If you believe this myth put down the tofu and start reading    urlLink Muscle & Fitness Hers   or   urlLink Oxygen    Magazine . These will cure you of that horrible myth.   Another widespread rumor women have implanted themselves with is that doing 3hours of Cardio (i.e. elliptical machine, stairmaster, and treadmill) will make you look like Cindy Crawford. Point A is that if you are not already Cindy Crawford, you will never look like Cindy Crawford, no one has a personal airbrusher 24 hours a day.   Secondly, cardio is not the end all of fitness. Women that do cardio only burn calories while they are on the machine, once you step off the machine you're done. Women who lift weights burn calories and fat while lifting and then thereafter because of the  urlLink breakdown and build-up of muscle . Hence they will loose body fat more quickly than those simply doing cardio.   Alright, I think this completes my rant for today. Look for my next article criticizing the carb counters.

      Hi everyone in blog-land. Just a quick service announcement about blogs for those new to view. This site is meant as my writing outlet. I know there are others out there, besides my cherished friends and family, that like to read my blog as well; however, please keep in mind that there are two sides to a story and this is just mine. There is always someone that is going to disagree with me or what I say, I am not totally oblivious to that. But I am going to say one thing, comments are just comments nothing more or less. If for some reason a random reader hates what I am writing, turn off your computer or go to another less subjective site. I hear Hillary Duff has a site or perhaps Clear Channel would be the place to go. In other words, bitching me out via comment will only drive me to write more controversially, I kid you not. This site is not for the weak at heart.   Thank you to all my wonderful friends who appreciate my writing. So to name a few friends: my hubby Jeff, Kelli & Mike, Alex, Chrissy & Matt & Brandon (our youngest viewer), Johnny Blaze, Aisha & Tim, Bess & Jason, Scoot, Stephanie, Emerson, Steven, and Daniel. Special thanks to Ibby the wonderpup and easy going Oliver.

      I really need to write a book. I have had so many "after school" jobs that have involved multiple scenarios of harrassment. You know the standard unwelcome jokes, the teasing about ethnicity or religion. The kind of harrassment everyone thinks is legal because no one will ever tell. Fortunately, I now am an angry 24 year old with a college degree and a rough couple of months and I'm not going to take it anymore. Recently, I was harrassed, jokingly and prankingly, by a co-worker/supervisor of mine. I heard the old jokes, how many doors have you knocked on, referring to my chosen religion and was also bombarded by a verbal assault from a customer because this co-worker/supervisor "wanted to see a fight". I couldn't believe I acted like the standard victim, not wanting to lose my job and playing the "it could have been my fault" card. Let me tell everyone now, that this type of harrassment is never the victim's fault. I know this now and hope this helps to heal the emotional wound set in. I still feel angry, insulted, and put down but I am not going to let this co-worker/supervisor hurt my self-esteem anymore.   I guess these are the things you learn as you grow older. That, along with taxes and the worth (or lack there of) of a college degree in a slow economy. My parents never prepared me for this kind of situation (they could never have known) but I hope to take something away from it myself.   On a less serious note, "Go Eagles". That chant always brings a tear to my eye, (from hysterical laughter).

      The word "retarded" has become extremely controversial lately. Hillary Duff and even Howard Stern have been bombarded by the Council for the mentally retarded people, or whatever they call themselves. Of course, H.S. ignored that message in all its uselessness. But now even my good friend (let's call her A) has been scolded in a local newspaper through a letter of complaint,by a former supervisor (we'll call her C), for using the word in casual conversation, not even in a meeting or formal setting (Of course no real names or initials were used here or in the newspaper). But on a personal note, I think bitching to a newspaper about the use and context of one word is positively absolutely retarded. It's called a job, get one.  However, I feel the need to put this issue to rest, therefore, I checked the Webster's Dictionary, as I often do by my contract as an english major, and the word retard means " to hinder, delay, or slow progress of" or retarded means "slowed or delayed in development, esp. mentally". Notice the dictionary only states "especially" mentally not "specifically" mentally, there is a difference. And so technically, the word retard or retarded does not specifically refer to the mentally handicapped. I could just casually say, "that car looks retarded" or "that car looks slow or delayed in its development" by which not referring to the mentally handicapped at all. I am only referring to the finished look or speed of the car. Same goes for a sentence or a person but keep in mind that I am not calling them mentally handicapped because that is not the definition of the word.   After all, a word is only a reference if someone makes the connection, meaning I am not forcing them to, nor do I care. Logically, attracting more attention to the word or subject causes it to spread that connection and twists the meaning. If only people read their dictionaries before becoming so adament in their accusations, (now I am referring to C). My only advice is no one likes a tattle tale.    Endnote, Why does any of this matter when there are people and animals starving on the streets in Philadelphia! Get a hobby C!  For those interested, here is the letter written by C in a local newspaper:  The first time my mother heard me use "retarded" to mean "stupid" (probably when I was around 8), she explained why that word was so hurtful and added that if a parent of someone with mental retardation had overheard me, he/she would have felt like crying. I never used it again.   I was shocked and saddened when I recently heard an adult in a professional situation call something "retarded." Children need to be taught to understand the significance of their words; adults should know better.   To use "retarded" interchangeably with "stupid" is to deny all the positive qualities that people with mental retardation can undoubtedly offer. When I heard that adult use "retarded" like that, anything else that person had to offer quickly went by the wayside.   -No changes or additions were made to this article prior to posting.

      Summer is here! Okay maybe I am a little late with this but I have been through a lot in the past few months. I actually had the chance to experience the wonderful weather while running early Thursday morning down Kelly Drive. Please keep in mind that early for the unemployed is before noon. I suppose unemployment can be enjoyable, at times. The wind was in my hair, the sun was in my face and unfortunately so were the twenty or so guys and their lewd comments every quarter mile. But I didn't care yesterday because life was perfect.   In addition to my new found running routine, I have gained a new reading hobby as well. Here are a few choice books recommended by South jersey Girl: "In Her Shoes", "Good in Bed", and "Sappho's Leap". The last book is not recommended for children, grandparents, fraternity boys, or staunchy people. Although, I do believe everyone should partake in all of the new Jennifer Weiner books, criers beware. She has vibrant characters and a cute dog, usually named Nifkin. If anyone has any suggestions for summer reading feel free to comment here or e-mail me.  Of course, an age old tradition of summer for me is the Jersey shore. Today I am on my way to OC and maybe Sea Isle for a little tryst. No one knows beaches like Jersey. And there is no question that Mack and Manco's pizza is also a staple food for many jerseyans. If you didn't know this, here are a few simple rules, for shoobies, to follow while visiting NJ this summer:  1. Please don't feed the tourists, they are an angry lot 2. For gods sake, Watch the Tramcar Please 3. Sea gulls were there first, don't piss them off 4. Wearing a ruffled skirt and tank top does not make you an individual 5. Boys: avoid the girls in costume hanging from swings (objects in mirror may appear prettier than they truly are) 6. Do not sit on the steps leading to the beach, you will be stepped on 7. Watch for projectile pooh, a sea gull never forgets  That is all for now. I will update these rules as needed throughout the summer.

      Tanning has become a real phenomenon in Philadelphia. The strangest people are very concerned in the darkness of their skin and glow of their wrinkles. The grandmothers have come out to haunt tanning salons near you. Not only is Philadelphia a well-known fat ugly city but we have those same fat ugly people with an extreme change of color during the summer months. News Flash to those select rude ugly women in south Philly (you know who I am talking about), it doesn't help. If you have an ugly face, body and especially personality tanning will not cure you, neither will therapy. Please jump off a rock and die.   I take this tone only because of being scorned in my new part-time job as a tanning salon girl. Women are the strangest creatures when it comes to tanning. They will bite your head off for lack of towels, lack of time, abundence of minute computer errors, and of course uncontrollable machine malfunctions set them off into homocidal tizzys. The tan is the most holiest form of self worship. I only wish I could list those whom I have hated. The regulars that bitch and moan and yell from the next room "What am I supposed to do",  my response, "Get your fat ass in the machine". Aaaahhh that felt good.   Anyway, as far as I am concerned I'd rather bake in the sun, in Florida, for free than tan in a salon ever again after this job.
