      Fridays are funny. At some point, unbeknownst me to me, Friday became a psuedo-holiday as evidenced by the phrase 'Happy Friday'. So how did I spend my happy Friday. An 11 hr shift @ Kaplan, followed by drinks (or rather, drink) with some of the other Kaplanites.  The upside, I got to see my colleagues in a new light, and my manager may not be the crapweasel I thought he was. The downside, looking like a pus cuz I had to leave early.  And i got caught in the rain. Hard. And just think, I get to work Saturday too ______________________________________________   Greatest Songs Ever:  the Prodigy - Smack My Bitch Up; Alana Davis - 32 Flavors

      My official first real post. Can you feel the electricity in the air.     I don't really have much to say right now. I'm home sweating my ass off. And thanks to oh so timely Parkchester renovations, I won't have AC until next week, which means in the meantime, not only do i get to sweat it out, I have no choice but to take a bath. As opposed to a shower, how dare you think that of me. So here I am, in the greatest city in the world, slowly melting like a big ole' chocolate chip. Its gonna be a long summer  _______________________________________________     Greatest Songs Ever..right now  -  Seven Mary Three - Punch In and  Out; JC Chasez - Some Girls (Dance With Women)

      So I've established that this works. I'm going to spend some time tweaking the design because, well, I'm a tweaker. Anyone seen my html book around....

      Testes..testes..one..two..uh..three?  Now that I have that taken care of, its time to get down to business. I have no business starting a blog, nothing of interest to say, and no real time to dedicate to this. This might be interesting

      I had a most profound experience this morning. After years of cruel hateful comments, I must now admit that Usher happens to be the fucking man. I caught him in Bryant Park this morning before work, and damn. He's like the Michael Jackon of my generation. Ya know..without the pedophilia thing. And the nose thing. Oh well, there's still time.  After work, chilled with Martine and Juan at Mojo on the lower east side. If you're going to go to any type of eatery with a pair of foodies, prepare to bring your A-game. So Juan and I are going to collaborate on a project via email. Might work out for the best. I'm more intellect and dry humor, and Juan's all dripping wet emotion..wait, that sounds bad  Gah..looking forward to another 11 hr shift @ kaplan. As Emily noted, I'm not so much selling my soul by the hour, as I am whoring myself. Which almost makes it worthwhile.

       Just got home from Mike's and tired as hell. Juan and I tossed around movie ideas. I think it helps to talk about it to keep me motivated. I've been stuck in the development stage for quite some time now. I've finally got down to the essence of the story. Twenty-something indifference. I guess it does goood to bounce ideas off of someone. It adds another layer of realness. And additional commitment. As Nietzsche said "<>One person seeks a midwife for his thoughts; the other, someone he can assist. Here is the origin of a good conversation". Amen brother.    ______________________________________________     Greatest Song Ever -  Sinead O'Conner - Nothing Compares 2 U

      Eyes...red...with rage. SO i get my phone bill, and its like 200 bucks. Guess i forgot to pay last month. Opps. So I, being the concerned consumer that I, take a moment to review my bill. And there's a 60 dollar charge for text messages. So I contact the tmobile customer service line. Not only did catherine zeta jones douglas not pick up, but I was sassed. By a customer service rep. Me..its like the usual fucker, fuckee relationship got all mixed up. I asked about the charge, and she explained that i has received a 1000 messages. I said hell no. She said it may be from AIM. I ask to be told where it says that each AIM transaction is a message. She says i should have received it. I again ask where, and this POS rep has the nerve to get smart. as did her manager.  So fine, i'll pay the bill. With a memo stating "kiss my ass". and i'll write the national HQ. Just to see if i can get cathy to write back.  I also ordered the Drop back today. I tried it my way, and it didn't work So now its Lisa's way.  Hopefully the bag queen will have provided proper counsel.  And tomorrow's my play date with LB. Hummus and a flick. MMmm MMM  Oh yeah, and  urlLink Rick James died  of...natural causes? Its so anti-climax. Like..he should have od'd on something crazy. Like cheeseballs (thats cocaine and cheese), or a combination of flinstones chewables, redbull, and 'ludes.  Oh well, James Brown is still around to do some crazy shit...and he will. Trust me. Oh but he will _______________________________________________

      So..I my Manhattan Portage bag came today. It sucks as. I ordered it against the advice of Lisa, and it bit me in ass. Hard. And left a mark. That shit's going back ASAP. Hopefully overstock will still have  urlLink this  item in stock. Whats not to love. Its big. Has lots of pockets, and says 'drop' for no good reason  And for my Freudian slip of the week. i walked up to Sarah in Acadamics to ask her a quick question about the SAT. Instead, what comes out of my mouth is "sarah, i've got a quickee for ya'. No harm done, and she laughed it off..just a little too long for my tastes. _______________________________________________  Greatest Song Ever:  Sonic Youth - Teenage Riot
