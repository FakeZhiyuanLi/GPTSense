       16 more days to go...  16 more stressful days that is. Need ideas to what I can continue to do while facing this constant thing called boredom. The good thing is that I have a window seat facing the others while my back is against the window. Looking at the list, I found  urlLink Yahoo! Games  friendly enough, reading other blogs was good, browsing  urlLink English tabloids  are also quite a good remedy for boredom. What else?   SOS - some of you experienced surfers at work out there, do send to me some of your good stuff to my  urlLink email  or post a comment with your recommendations. It's all in good faith for passing time.    Sometime later in the day, managed to stumble across this handy  urlLink Yeti-lympics  website. Check it out, runs with just your normal flash plug-in.  Very much later in the day (dusk). Saw a colleague get the sack for being an imbecile. Now how in the world does one define that? Do you have some kind of moron testing device. EH! EH! What about some super bergman, johari window, 360 degree feedback? EH! EH! No sir-ree, right here, in our own backyard, we use the method of go fish. Here's a guy, who's promised a guaranteed sale since we are supposedly so good, so great, so famous, etc. And then he's promised a full suite of software and applications. Oh my gosh, you can even take it off the shelf and sell. Jangan main-main... Handal ni.   Fast forward 6 months from that dreadful day he accepted the offer, he's been kicked around left, right and centre. Even better yet, there was no completed software. No powerpoint, no presentation, no flyer, no leaflet, zip, nothing, the big zero factor was all. And they expected him to sell a friggin stealth software for RM25K. No documentation, no design specs, no manuals, once again I saw him hit that big ZERO! For crying out loud, how much longer will our damn so called information super highway going to ruin the lives of innocent graduates. Wasting millions of valid money handed by the government, only to land in the hands of these *C-Class Personnel earning fat cat salaries.   Your day will come, and when it does, there will be no one for you to stand behind and go finger pointing.  YOU F*****G BASTARDS!!!  You know who you are.  * So called  Chief  officers entrusted in developing our local talents .

       The End is the Beginning is the End  Just like before, and after going through the storm, everything seems calm and serene once more. All in all, life has always been moving in its own circles. I read a book once that spoke of life and a journey that has alredy been decided on. Though on your path, it may seem like it was your destiny to walk those steps, but for someone else it may just seem coincidental. And how close are ties between coincidence and luck? Do you in any way believe that coincidence could have always meant that you were supposed to find what you were looking for? Is it not a state or fact that seems rather too planned to be called accidental?   This is to where some people would believe and call this karma, while from the words of Paulo Coelho, this is called  'Muktab' .  Now it would be baseless for me to tell you the entire story and the way it should end. But if you're where I am and are searching for the answers, do check out the few top novels that have always been favourites for enlightening the soul and easing the mind of today's wretched chaos and confusion.   1) Paulo Coelho 'The Alchemist'. 2) Milan Kundera 'The unbearable lightness of being'. 3) Victor Hugo 'Les Miserables'.

       The End Complete  Finally, that darn letter has left my hands and into the rightful owners. Whatever happens from here on, is another journey through this never ending quest to fulfill that pyramid of needs. How ironic it must seem that so many people learned the basic theories without knowing where the data samples were collected from. I bet most of you never knew that many these theories were done in Western and American cultures, and not at all in Eastern cultures. Do we as asians actually know where we stand? Do we actually understand the concepts of the high-context and low-context meaning of these tests? Are we left in a globalized world where we are led by our so called gurus ( mostly our local apeks ) who studied the Western cultures?   What happened to the adopt, adapt and invent marketing approach? We are supposed to be heading upwards by fortifying our pillars of foundation built on our intrinsic and rich cultures. But look at where we are, today. Spiritually, we do not know who we are and what we want. Mentally we are weak and still carrying the stigma of living under the shadow of cultural imperialism.  And what's worst, the guardians who were hoped to have travelled miles overseas to acquire their knowledge to educate us end up eating us, just like that similar proverb of  'harapkan pagar, pagar pulak makan padi' .   Moral of the story,  'orang yang mengumpan, orang pertama masuk ke neraka' . He who lures and snares, is the first to have bought a one-way ticket to hell.

       Starry eyed surprise or sunset eyes?  Once again it's looking very much like it's heading back to the drawing board. Oh what a lovely time to once more be looking at the stars and chilling out while others prepare for tomorrow's day in the office. Here I am searching the web at what un-Godly hour scouring for a new place to call work. And what better place to start than going through  urlLink monster.com.sg ,  urlLink jobstreet.com.my  and  urlLink jobsdb.com.my .... Here in M'sia, the employment and unemployment handling is rather hostile and has always been like a nauseating experience that you just wished you could throw up. Tip of advice, stay cool and be focussed! Don't let those darn prigs get to you and have things their way. Go ahead and read more about some resignation  urlLink do's and don'ts .   While the topic is on employment, why not hop over to  urlLink this website  and find out what's new in resignation letters. Or if you like, then just goggle a search on resignation letters and you will find a couple of interesting results that will surely amaze and delight you. Pretty neat stuff if you're walking the plank!   Remember - Don't ever let them break you!

       Numero uno again?  Funny, recently I remember that the IKEA number one became the world's richest man, overtaking the owner of that software giant. But now, a month later and this? M'sians have the most sex under the sheets but get the least sleep? Gosh look at  urlLink these stuff , tell me that those scandinavian furnitures don't come complete with spycams, tracking and gprs devices. Changing matresses meant having more sex? And look at those tiny figures coming from the world's most populous place.... 80% of the time they prefer to do it outside the bedroom, did they also forget to mention outside of the country and into yours as well?  Man, somebody better stay off those furniture. If you asked me it looks more like a conspiracy between the top two. One makes furniture while the other provides the PR.

       The Beginning  Greetings, netizens! If for some reason you were expecting something pleasant, something sweet and something more decent, let me usher you by saying that this is not the place. The reason you are here, is because you are curious, or because you know me, or who needs a damn explanation or reason to surf the web.   You are here because you believe in your freedom to search and discover. From the luxury of your home or from a coffeehouse with wi-fi, or like me doing it at the expense of my professional time, just to have my personal time to stare at that box that we have becomed so accustomed to. And that you believe, that in so many ways you should be free to surf where ever and when ever you wish to.... No one should stop you from doing so, hence you are welcomed to stay and free to leave.

       Ouch that oughta hurt!  Ohh, this is one straight out of the a certain beer ad being played in local cinemas.  urlLink Bride flees with dowry on big day , and to think that we lived in an age where matchmaking by elders were not in practice anymore. Even our local  urlLink women organisation  is busy trying to keep up with the pace. Yea, right! Why look so far when all there is to it is six degrees of separation. By the way, did I mention that I have a second, third, fourth, fifth life? And I have friends...  Moving on to F1, it's almost unbelievable to hear this guy and his arrogance. Oh my friend of a  Butang , don't go quoting stuff prematurely " If I win the championship I don't mind if I haven't won a race ". Don't go shooting yourself on the foot when we know that you have a better engine now. Elementary dude, we all saw this familiar scene happen to the iceman last season, and at least he won a couple or more races while pushing the great man to the end. With that in mind, we'll wait till the end of today's qualifying to determine who's at the front row of things.  And finally, some people do blog in mysterious places. At the rate Becks is going, soon he'll run out of skin to advertise. This time around, his contemporary piece of artwork is called " urlLink  In the face of adversity  ". Yup, it's an adverse decision alright to finally hardcode the two most prized girls under your skin. Tattoos really do have its pros and cons.

       Friday flicks   While the football season has all but one more to go, for me it was more of catching the perfect slumber while the heavy and sudden downpour made snuggling under the sheets an art form. Not having to be bothered by the sound of an alarm clock is by far one of the ups of waiting for the next job to start. While there is so much catching up to be done, there's nothing better than giving a poor man his slumber to begin with. Continuing with the catch up, I finally had the time to watch Taxi 1,2, and 3, on DVD of course. Man for those of you who love cars but have not watched any Taxi series, boy oh boy, you don't know what you're missing!  With the European GP coming up this weekend, there is still so much more to life other than football. By the way, Carlsberg has a Euro 2000  500ml  green label that's available during the coming Euro football month. I reckon it's to keep the missus happier singing along to just one larger can! *wink*wink*  A lot more catching ups to be done, but for now, it's preparation time for my journey north to the beach, and snorkeling my lungs out! Ahem, not to mention researching on the culture and their rather unusual lifestyle.  Adieu fellow M'sians.

       Vincenzo has left the building!  Finally, it feels so much like the way it should, and it's good to see that while so many others are still struggling to keep abreast their balance of sanity, I'll be making my exit in style.   Suddenly, it's that feeling of being almost weightless, basking in the window seat for the last time. As the glaring morning sun shines in all its glory and as I catch a glimpse of it reflecting off the passing cars, I'm reminded by the sound of passion growing from within. That glorious tune sung by many to accompany the left boot of good ol' Jonny!    Swing low, Sweet Chariot Comin' for to carry me home Swing low, sweet chariot Comin' for to carry me home!   When once was dark, now I see. A guide to the visage to my tangled past. And as I proceed, fear but all subsides. The ' maktub ' of my life set out to be. Free for the moment.   I am happy, I am happy.

       Going, going, gone...  Heard it on the radio yesterday evening that Houllier was on the verge of leaving the  urlLink Reds . Couple of hours into the night and it was finally official. About time too, as the show was beginning to dull most fans. For now it'll be more speculation on who's going to sit at the helm.  While back here in Pleasantville, Boredom KL, my window seat is finally up for grabs. As pity restless souls waiting to claim my prize of the coolest spot in the office as well as a free-for-all ticket to a no-holds-barred experienced of surfing anything, I was already on my way exiting the place for the second last time. Soon it'll be forgotten (right about once the money is in), and clearer skies will be in my view.  A smile appears thinking back as to how the end was worth enduring. Day by day it felt like forever. But the process has to be learnt, it's part of modern day life (trials & tribulations), in a modern day struggle for a modern a day man.   No fairy tale ending here folks, just a rather boring tale, told by a bittersweet bloke.

       Mondays are boring  Coming back to the reality of a slow moving day in the office, even waking from bed is slower than usual. But who can blame those who filled their weekend watching the biggest anti-climax to the football season ending of an FA cup. Lucky for me, as a neutral I didn't have to put myself through the torment of enduring the whole ordeal.   Channel switching has become a norm in our lives and it was a life saver watching the remaining bit of the F1 qualifiers. It was something new, in a race track where M.Shumey has dominated over the years, and to see him qualify fourth fastest meant that the possibilities of a new winner was highly on the cards. Knowing that the Monaco Grand Prix has never been a high speed over-taking track is all the more a reason to start finger crossing and hoping.   Race day Sunday  Chips and drinks all happily placed beside the remote, it was going to be an eventful 2 hours of fast moving F1 action. Other than the delayed start, the race got on to the opposite of Saturday's FA cup final. Even in the first few laps there was drama coming from the BAR of Sato as he jumped from 8th to 4th on the grid through a perfect start, only to watch in agony as his V10 Honda engine blew up in smoke. The incident caused a dramatic accident that saw a Sauber slam the back and leap over the slowing McLaren of Coulthard.  Further as the race developed, a second high-speed crash occured in the tunnel where the 2nd place runner Alonso, in dramatic style lost control and slammed into the tunnel walls at high speed. All in his bid to go around the back-marker of Williams R.Shumey. As the car skidded on its wrecked body, the interesting thing to note was the flailing right hand of Alonso gesturing sign language to the passing Williams.  A few laps after driving under the race limit behind the Safety Car, and at almost the identical place in the tunnel, who could have imagined the crash of Ralf's big brother Michael. As the countless replays showed, M.Shumey had a tyre lock up and swung to the right only to be nudged by the trailing Williams of Montoya. Deliberate or accidental, who knows?  And as the race reached its climax, who would have thought that the Renault of Trulli and the BAR Honda of Button was pushing to the very limit of the Monaco GP. Between the two, a first ever F1 victory. And in the final lap, only a mere tenth of a second separated the dueling two. But in the end it wasn't a day to be for the Honda driver as Trulli courageously hung on for his first ever GP win. Barichello followed in a distant third while Montoya finished a step behind in fourth.   In six days time, one can only hope that the European GP would be as exciting as this. By the looks of it, Nurburgring is almost a home GP for the Shumey brothers, I wouldn't bet against the elder brother taking it from start to finish. Though, Murphy's Law applied, who knows what could unfold this Sunday.

       Good morning Black Friday!  Sorry to disappoint, but the sad thing about trying to script up anything M'sian is that before commencement, by hook or by crook something or somehow will cause a delay, reschedule, or permanent abandonment of the project. For now it seems that even the name cannot be decided on. Those days it was more famously put as technical errors ( car broke down, printer out of ink, dog ate my project, etc ). I'm shocked at how soon the name had changed to  Glorious Guru  (Guru Gemilang) instead. Gosh, my flame of excitement has somewhat dimmed. It's not as though creativity comes on a schedule, and while waiting and lagging for a simple decision to be made, I think I'm this close to losing it.  Do you see the trend? It's always so nice to hear of new and improved ideas. But how often do we fill our glasses with good old enthusiasm only to carry it up so high before letting it drop and break like always. There's no wonder as to why over the years that our culture has somewhat turned to 'Don't care' or  tidak apa .  How often have you in your lifetime or as a kid remember trying out for: 1) Badminton - Bringing your racquet only to be told to stand in the sun and wait for someone to bring the shuttle. 2) Football - But was sent to the wrong field, or told to come at the wrong time, or made to sit as a goalie. 3) Talk/seminar - And was drilled by some attendant at the frontdesk. Eg: Why are you here? Who sent you here? Mana  pass ? 4) Day trip - No drinks, no food, all DIY.  5) Signing for any service - After the long wait for your number to be called.  Counter clerk:  Alamak! This one looks like a mistake. Encik, you queued in the wrong lane-lah.... Aisey-man, your one is over to the other lane  kat sana .  You:  Arr...arr, eh, b-b-but...thank you. (  !#$%^^!  )  How much pun can one take? It's only a matter of time before anyone would be influenced by our culture. Hence, even a foreigner in M'sia knows and behaves the same as a local while on the road, shopping, eating, and so on. They ( the source ) ignorantly call it culture-lah. I call it the wrong strategy applied to the education system.   Cumbersome and worrying times  If something is not done immediately, we have only ourselves to blame for this degrading and decaying society. At some point in time, each individual will have to perform his or her duty in order to better the situation. Saying "They can, I also can-lah" doesn't help improve the situation. And waiting for the source to start implementing a campaign is too tedious a process and way too slow for the message to reach us, the receivers. Even if it did reach, the inconsistency is by far more damaging than not seeing or knowing the campaign all together.  Many children are left in despair and dispirited after going through a rough experience. While many young adults find the shocking reality a reverse culture shock after returning from overseas. Many have left and we can't blame them, nor should we envy them. But for those who have decided to stay, what can we do?

       Happening Thursday    The Monaco Grand Prix   Remembering that the countdown is still on and down to the final bend where after this coming weekend, it's the clear straight run to the home stretch! Woo hoo, and in time for the Monaco Grand Prix. Will it be six in a row for the Ferrari frontman? Or could some dark horse break the streak of the  scuderia ? Will the silver-arrowed iceman finally cometh and land a podium finish? Check your local listings at the  urlLink Formula1  website.    Rumours of a HK Porn VCD?   Moving on, I've found out the gist behind the HK actress porn video that's been surfacing in the past week was actually a well kept secret of more than 10 years. Apparently the rape was for some retribution by some serious thugs. Nothing new there folks. Sorry to disappoint.    Continuing to DVD   BTW, the DVD box set ver-9 trilogy of both Matrix and LOTR ( bootleg versions I was told ) have been released not too long ago. Includes extra footage, interviews and other usual scripts and stunts.     What's new for fans of the KOP   Keeping up this short and blurpy spurts of two-liners are the post season scrap, er, i mean wrap of the EPL. As usual, the NATO theory is being adopted by the media on the have beens and could have of the Reds. What's there to debate after it's all said and done. Have that feeling that we are all in for another camouflaging season where nothing ever changes. Just hanging heads of faithful supporters walking on and singing the song of a lark, with hopes in our hearts that we will never walk alone!    TAK NAK Campaign   Saw in the  *humpday  papers, a local  guru  talking about the strategies behind the Tak Nak campaign. Sounds promising as usual, but then again, how do you maintain a PR campaign utilising the media in trying so desperately to influence the already foreseeable voices of majority? Ever heard of IMC? It's the integrated bit of marketing communcation that keeps the gist and substance of messages (verbal/non-verbal/written) unified and consistent. The keyword is 'consistent'.  Eg:- Role models (smokers) = Confused students looking at TAK NAK ads. *humpday - the middle working day of the week, where after lunch is downhill towards Friday and the weekend!    Super Guru   Talking about gurus and what a super guru would mean, I'm also interested in starting my daily comic script on the  Lifestyles of Super Guru!  First, I'll need my  crazy-mat-super-hero  of a Spawn-freak  (pronounced  Spunnt  by our yellow haired nightmarket traders) to draw me up a Super Guru wearing her super outfit, hopefully red thongs under that modified see thru hybrid-sarung and kebaya ( ones seen in the recent fashion week ). While not forgetting the retractable rattan ( rotan ) that is customizable for pointing, scratching, caning, and using as a radio antennae ( adjustable add-on kit for cars sold separately ). Then I'll need some promo items done by my ever dependable folks down at Pointsign advertising. We'll work out the profit sharings later, dude!  And on my part, I'll bring along the gist of it, the environment, the settings and drawback, etc and give life to the characters of modern day Ahmed (noble 2nd royalty trained to take up politics), Ah Tuck (math wizard and uncouth riceboy-cum-daily-nose picker from Perak) and Mohan (son of a humble semi-pro football stringer). All senior 2 pupils from SM Bukit Bintang. A boys school - rivals to the LaSalle Brothers school, and a short distance to Assunta Convent school. Not so far away, lies the ever influence of globalisation and capitalism. The meeting place every Friday where the window opens for students to meet while waiting for approximately 2 hours for their ride home. A social melting pot of cultures. A first peek to maturity.   All the more a reason to look forward to Friday!   The gurus  Cik Hamimah  =  Petite and soft spoken Geography-Science teacher Mr Ham C.F   =  Curriculum and faithful fan of the 60s badminton team of M'sian. Mr P. Kumar  =  The suspicious and cynical scrooge En Zam       =  Semi-bald, semi-charmed kinda life Mrs. Rossy   =  Headmistress where the only thing rosy about her is her name Ms Ling      =  Our young superguru in the making! (this one's for MGS fans)   Continued hopefully in the next few days ... +Disclaimer: names are 100% fictional and is in no way representations to any person or persons.

       And the Marquis lives… along with Leopold  Welcome to the escapism world of autoerotic asphyxiation or hypoxyphilia, made popular by the daemonic writer himself, the Marquis de Sade. In years to come his lustful poetry would be infamously known to the world as  Sadism  or to those of you so called goodie-two-shoes who didn’t know, it’s those porno acts of domination that play in your mind while trying ever so desperately to erase. Vestal virgins, this is neither the time nor place for your inquisitive nature. Humankind has strange habits and behaviour, and since the days of the Marquis, through scholarly and by law, the *mens rea is far greater than the **actus reus. Where then do we as humans stand when none can deny at least having one lustful thought of dominance?   Are we criminals to a crime in our thick skulls? What if the action was acted out, and the dominated was mindful of being a masochist? To those who don’t know,  masochism  is the state of being willingly dominated or completely submissive. It was coined after another so called insane writer who authored the book Venus in Furs, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. The last name would be later infamously known as masoch-ism. Back here in M’sia, we now have the  urlLink first ever death by murder through the combined acts of Sado-Masochism . Big words and by a case worth following as the nation slowly unveils more and more sadistic and masochistic acts that turned sour.   An article in theSun today, was on the opinion of legalizing prostitution in order to satisfy the urges of those in need of fornication. Looking back at how our neighbours have both legalized the act, it has indeed kept sex crimes and the widespread of aids lower. The benefits are truly there, but can our culture of being highly religious in nature give in to this once never imaginable thought of legal sex workers? Can we stomach the thought of aiding a poor unfortunate soul in wishing to take up a profession of being a professional of the trade down south only because it kept rice in the bowl? Will there be double standards and cynicism for those involved directly and indirectly in the trade? Will it only open the door to a widespread mushrooming of the illegal trade, due to the cheaper and even more easily accessible resource compared to the legalized? Think, think!  Research our culture, legal system, beliefs, and the trade before jumping to conclusions. Bear in mind though, every second wasted breed new born Marquis’ and Leopolds’.     *mens rea - guilty mind **actus reus - guilty action or action of the thing

       Fear is how I fall  After taking time off during the weekend, office life is back to the usual boring shit and never the slightest cool. I guess that's why we slave our arses during the best times of the day only to appreciate life more. But is it too late? I was looking out the window week in and week out counting down the days to my departure. No normal person who was forced to walk out on his job can stay calm and cool plus standing proud to say that this shit feels good. It's bad enough pondering going through a small office where you see that same dumbass perpetrator to your crime. Day one, is good for him and bad for you. Your distraught brings you no good at all.   Finding out that the more you struggle equals sinking faster and deeper. Deeper and deeper into this plight of avarice. A good representation would be of imagining what's it like being in quicksand. When first plunging into the pit, you panic and your brain starts to issue red alert signals throughout your body. Your vision is immediately impaired, and all other senses heighten. You start to confuse the realism in your brain with the surrounding in a nano second. Your body moves in hectic motions trying to grasp anything for a lifeline. Only to be pulled deeper as you fight to separate the reality from the myth - all this while sinking and still sinking.   Finally, the adrenalin expires and your exhaustion creeps in. Your muscles have burnt as much glucose and protein imaginable. You begin to surrender the fight, when you realise that it can't get any deeper, and that the sinking feeling is only as bad as the way you forcefully struggled ( or so you imagined ). Sighing and resigned you bravely reopen your eyes, this time to find that the world is so different from down low. As you feel the remains of what's left of your adrenalin flowing through your veins, you start to feel a natural high. Your senses seem more like normal, you start to enjoy the warmth of the pit, the floating feeling of a buoy and that idiology of being stranded in the middle of nowhere seems so welcoming. A feeling that many pay to feel or enjoy through tobacco addiction or a nudge above - hash. What once was defined and controllable becomes the great unknown. But you like it - the other choices would be to go insane or turn psychotic. For those who have done without, that's divine and I  tabit  (salute) your mettle.  Continuing from the first paragraph, the sooner you recover, the sooner you'll enjoy the view. Your courage and temperament will lift you higher and way above those cowardly perpetrators to your crime. Whichever day you begin to do this, you'll wipe the smiles of their faces and chances are that by now, they are dying in guilt while swallowing all the bullshit that came out through their teeth.   Stress is the key to evolution, understanding it is vital. Some perform miracles when in that state. Others run and cover under the blanket. Experiencing it can be damaging - both mentally and physically. But coming out of it makes you ever stronger. The main ingredient is knowing that stress resides in every humankind, just don't ever let it be your distress. I need not spell out those names of heros turn overnight villains. That's the job of journalists and magazine writers to expose. But I do know corporate arses, and these goons would sell their mother for less than a dime if they could. No reason for us to hate them, pity would do fine.

       S.E. Impian  Another weekend past and what a memorable week it has been. After performing a successful sprint up and down the NKVE in my silver  impian , it's easy to see why some people rate the car so highly. Make no mistake, there was a full trunk load of stuff in the boot, and for a 1.6 sedan the ride was relatively silent and powerful enough. Not to mention trying your very best to keep the car under the speed limit, while your foot sinks into that ever so responsive throttle control. The in-car entertainment was noteworthy as the sound could still be heard with enough crisp, while only beginning to fade after moving a notch above the 110kmh mark. And to think that from its size and built one would easily be deceived that its another gasoline guzzler, much to my amazement the impian did a remarkable distance of 350km at an average of 120kmh/3rpm, and only consumed an approximate of RM30 worth of gas. ( That's about 23 litres of gas. ) Much has improved and the Mistubishi valve timing-i engine was a few notches above the older versions found in earlier Proton models. Something good that has long been expected of Proton. Other plus points include the  urlLink  Lotus   tuned ride and handling, limited edition 16" rims with 205/50 tyres that grips the road with ease, while the MacPherson struts keeps the car from floating and bouncing.   One of the really negative things about the impian was the practicality of its headlamps. The design looks good and appealing but does not come with the required distance of a normal headlamp. The drive down at night was almost an eyesore of trying to catch the view ahead. Especially when all this time you noticed that the roads in Klang-Valley are nicely lit up. While driving it was evident that the lights of the impian at a 110kmh shined a mere give and take distance of 5 metres. A horrid sight, which is hoped that Proton will voluntarily make some adjustments without payment. Secondly, while the simple interior design is very much welcomed and bears so much resemblance of a continental car, the tilted air-cond vents in the middle are a notch too selfish, not even a Beemer would leave its front passenger grasping for air in the hot sunny afternoon. Driving all around in the day time meant that other passengers were given a free ride in my moving sauna, not forgetting that the SE came with leather seats.   All in all, the car can easily be given a rating 7 out of 10 for its superb ride and handling, cost-efficiency and its powerful drive. It's also a value-for-money buy that's 20K lesser than other cars in its class. However, because of its rather low budget interior and lack of key features such as SRS airbags and ABS, it misses out on that winning punch. Potential buyers should check out the  urlLink idiosyncracies  of the impian and its  urlLink price .

       A view to a kill  Looking out of my window seat and staring at the D'sara highway that leads to the city, one has to wonder how being a victim in the rat race means nothing to the overall life-cycle of the city. Even if a few good men decided to try and change the  status quo , the maze that we have come to know would not augur a sight of the telling labyrinths that has kept all entrapped in this game of a race. But why should it, when we are merely pawns in this cruel game.   If anyone thinks that they could challenge the system, then you can face it head on with all consequences kept in view or you can just leave and not tarry. Whatever your decision, the one thing that is for certain is that somebody is bound to replace you. So many have fallen and so many have disperse. Yet, it is no wonder how many others have sat in my same view only to ponder the exact same thoughts that I am going through. Could it be a cycle that bears no evolution and is fueled by humankind's desire and greed for wealth and satisfaction. Probably so.  Coming to the point, then it would be easier to think that it is the way of the world, the unspoken reality that has overcome the individual self when trying to weigh what is right and what is wrong. But did we not have enough primary education to suffice this disaster of losing control of the child within? For the record let's dub this child within the 'self'. And the external behaviour that everyone comes in contact with as the 'person'.   Do we know exactly who the person is that we show to the world? And not a mirror of what people want or expect us to be? Or are we led to believe that our cognition, action and behaviour are actually a reflection of the self within? Think for a moment. Take your time and think real hard. For the point that I will make warrants no answer, simply a mere reflection of what has become our culture, and probably yours.   Coming towards the end of looking out of this window seat ( approximately another 8 days to go ), and while I ponder the frayed ends of my very sanity, I have come no closer to where I was before and where I stand today. How could this be, I thought to myself? Are we not the people who are famed for  'service with a smile' , a caring and a sharing culture? When so many that have been here testify to the very facts that we are well and truly humble and modest. Please, stop the flattery.   It's going no where, especially not when it's a mere superficial and cover to the insidious beast that has come to erode the self like an eperdemic. Slowly but surely we have forgotten our roots. Then the question of  'who are we?' , must once more come to mind and stand firm. Like a beacon that will carry us through the darkness of globalisation. Like the bark of a star who will always seem visible in the bleak and cold dark night. Behind the pretenders and above the minds of those rain clouds, it never seizes to shine. Yet, we know they were always there, and yet we blame them for not shining through.   Such is the shame that has polluted the minds and hearts of the culture that we see today. We know or fail to let die the memory of what is right and wrong. I dare not speak of it as our conscience, for if the self warrants not the actions of the person, what conscience are we talking about anyway? That we would care for those who are weaker than us. Do we not owe a duty of care, make that a legal cuty of care to our loved ones, family, friends, neighbours, in short every other living being that we have met?   Then why would the person before me, and after me sit and ponder the very same raiders of our rice bowl. Daylight robbers of what we so frequently see in the corporate world that binds the street urchin and the kingpin in this global village.  On one hand lies the victims of this sad creation, and the other the blurred vision of victors of our destiny,  (tepuk dada tanya selera) . Is our society to conceal and carry on without the dignity of even trying to help our immediate neighbours. Are we only practitioners of our beliefs, applicable only when we are safe to practice this believe, and hypocrites when the situation summons to test that belief?  I do not know what is right or wrong. That is for the master and creator that lies in the self of each individual to decide. Not me, I'm just another victim of this rat race. Pondering whose shared realities that we as denizens of the Klang-Valley have come to know.

       The Countdown continues  And soon it's down to the last double digit of 10. By tomorrow, things will look ever so close to the end. Other than making a nuisance of myself, the office life could have never have felt better. Free  el cheapo  coffee, free internet and gaming station, free paper to waste and of course, many other personnel for me to annoy. Oh yes! That and the very fact that my bosses are being sued for an unfair dismissal of the earlier mention sacking of someone for being an imbecile. That's right, there was never a case and finally, some goon is going to pay dearly for the personal screw up.   It's beautiful, when so called literate a***holes with  el cheapo  college degrees sit at the helm, one can only expect holigan-like behaviour and unruly conduct. Best part is that the show that will soon take off will once more showcase the very worse in M'sian barbarians at action. These corporate apemen sometimes make the whole organisation look so crappy. Imagine, they call themselves part of a company that doesn't even acknowledge their existence in being even an agent, left alone an extension of the company. For a small tiny rat like company, what amazes one most is the way these goons seem to fool our local people in believing who they are. How can that be?  I'm glad that I still believe in the system, or what else is left of it. A long, long time ago, we produced qualified professionals that were accredited from the UK. Teachers who had the guts to tell wealthy parents of young and naughty kids to stay away from vices and illegal activity. Nurses who believed in efficiency. People who believed that being M'sian meant being part of a country that would boast of nothing more than the very palm oil that we produce, rice and rubber that we exported and the very same football team that could whip the likes of any team in our glorious Merdeka Stadium! A badminton team that need not psyche themselves after a single point and throw the game after one controversial line call.   No, no, and no, I still do not wish to think that the blame is on globalisation, or an technology, or some lame excuse like that. No, the pillar of what we believe in is our life line. Who was it that made believe that being American meant being free? Did they also tell you that free men were never ever equal? Why should we trade a life that is rich with a diverse culture for one that is rather simulated? And why should we disregard our past of being the centre of Asian voyage, in control of the flow of trade way back in the 16th and 17th century? I failed to let die the richness of my forefathers without even trying to reason what is my very own right. I'm not buying that crap that Magellan made a mistake when he made his way to the shores of what today is known as Praia Lane.   We are no pushovers! And I stand proof that the remnants of the past will never die. We can only be pushed, as far as we allow them to push us.   By the way, Malacca is still a damn nice place to visit, just in case you didn't know.

       The winds are blowing East again  Finally, a challenge to the ever dominating existence of Ferrari and M. Shumey. At the start of this season, it was looking more and more like one-way traffic to another one-sided F1 affair. Got to hand it to the maestro for being that good! And with the luck of Kimi, Montoya and R.Shumey it looked ever so much that it was going to be another Ferrari year. But like Murphy's Law where anything that can happen, usually does, we now got an unsual spice to the already perplexed mix. Out of no where zooms in Honda and that cocky English driver, Button. An unlikely hero to an already dulled crowd of enthusiasts. Though the fact of the matter is that for at least the previous race, the first 9 laps were as exciting as ever. As the gallery anxiously awaited that moment to where M.Shumey would pull out from his bag of tricks yet another breath-taking manouevre to sling past Button. Though in the end it only took a pitstop to change the leading standings, dare I say at least there was 9 laps of excitement. Not to mention a certain Montoya who could have spoild it for Shumey if he had managed to pass on the outside in the early stages.   But that's Formula 1. Anything that can happen, usually does! And I'll be hoping for another challenge to Ferrari, irregardless where it's coming from. I do hope that Button pushes Shumey all the way, and while he is being darn right irritating, shouldn't some pretender to the throne step up and take the fight a step higher? If only Mr. Williams could have kept Hill or Villenueve, we might be seeing someone rough it out with Ferrari. Looking back again, I don't think anyone could ever get bigger than the name Williams itself. Think about it, El Leone  (Mansell)  took so many years to finally be champion, and after that he made his exit. Then again, was it truly his decision? Then came his successor Hill. That guy really gave Shumey a run for his money and snatched a season. But what happened to him the following year? The same as El Leone. And in walks Hill's successor in the form of a certain Jacques Villenueve. Now that wasn't so long ago, and I'm sure those who watched would have recalled Shumey trying to muscle Villenueve towards the end, only to fail and see the title land in hands of Villenueve. My million dollar question is, why oh why change a winning team?   I mean, if ever someone could take the challenge to Ferrari, then it must be of either McLaren or Williams. These two teams have the big budgets to at least come close to Ferrari. But where are they today? Underperforming and overrated seems more like it. For the sport, for the records and for heaven's sake.... Can the real slim shady please stand up? And please put each one of your hands on that steering wheel and let fly with pedal to the metal! Fingers crossed that Honda with Button, will make it ever so impossible for Shumey to make it five straight wins. Sorry Zain, my money is on that Vtec shit.

       From the ashes of Vitruvius  Day 15 - and counting down the remaining 14 more days to go. Not surprisingly, the initial stages of leaving a job are one of the most stressful of an individual's life. That and amongst other devastating moments like the feeling of estrangement or going through a separation. Here's some help that I've found over at  urlLink careerbuilder.com  on a similar situation. Looking at being  urlLink burnout  and thinking about it, ever wondered what would happen when you meet the ultimate mutha of a boss that is going through a separation, has been estranged and is pressured ( from similar prigs above ) to fire anyone who's sinking his boat. Sure as hell know a brace of them! Advice to you, if you know that your boss is a prig and chances are that he is struggling to keep his sanity, leave and go find a better job! Not worth the hassle and problems going through that sort of hell. You spend enough of your solid and fruitful time of your life at work, it might as well be inducive enough for you to not get deranged.  The beauty of all this is that even while they expect you to leave, and are trying to make you push that red button, all you really need is a pair of headphones. Heck, if all that you have is earphones then by all means bring it on! It helps a lot when you start getting headshots and going on a roll. Muahahha.... (cracking of knuckles) Downloaded Tribes2 only to see that the dang 3D card on this old piece of junk doesn't support the game. What a bummer. Anyways, Unreal 2004 looks ever as tempting. Can't wait to start applying those decals of a certain group of annoying prigs. Muahahaha...  And with a good set of headphones, you can with ease download loads of audio and video for your entertainment pleasure. Those goons in seeing you handle the situation so well will boil inside and eventually blow up. Now, isn't that the joys of working for a dotCON company using a T3 line? It sure is my friends, it sure is.

       The saga continues....  The midday break will signify the march and stroll into the 15 remaining days left in this miserable environment. From the outlook and the cowardice of some so called experienced personnel who supposedly thought of themselves being at the macho end of things, seem all too obvious now that they knew nothing of the playing field. And now the entrusted seems all too capricious of the law, which ironically is the very same law that they flaunted with in the very beginning. How foolish are some who think that the tides will always remain high without ever turning ebb?   A pity, a pity. Alas, I knew this situation all too well. Some years back I remember sitting with  urlLink zain  and having a fag by the staircase leading up to the damn incubator that brought us nothing but shame in this so called dotCON dream. A reality show about young men being conned into accepting fake jobs in trying to build dotcoms that could challenge the west and equal the playing field. 4 drastic years from that ill-fated days of a smooth talking-bullshitting CEO and this! Funny, though their names change, they still look the same to me. With that talk about "How's the DB?" Get real dudes, what DB are you talking about? Even better, which century are you still stuck in? Sadly, I feel the pain of the government when it was declared that we are not innovative enough.   Innovate, innovate, innovate. Well, what's there to expect when it always end at R&C... Research & Copy.  urlLink More...

       The Mac turns 20  This week marks the  urlLink 20th birthday  of the pioneer to the personal computer, the  urlLink Macintosh Apple . Not many in this part of the world where piracy roams heavenly free, do really care about the Mac. Ask many new blood joining the workforce and they go, “Mac what? You mean you want to have a bite at McDonalds?” though it was the Mac that first introduced the pc to the lives of millions.    Think different  In many ways, the Mac has and always will be a machine that is built by enthusiast for the enthusiast. It’s something like choosing between a copy and the real thing. Mac innovations most probably remembered would be that of the GUI (short for graphical user interface) and the introduction of a mouse. Innovations were part of a driving factor that followed the Apple Macintosh.   Macintosh Test Drive  Even till today, the Mac with all its dual power is still one of the most design driven machines ever created. Think of how the iMac and eMac of today’s computing world clears the clutter of desk space. Even when the iPod was out, it showcased something trendy and unique with a library of affordable music – played on the iTunes player of course.   All in all, I’m glad to be a proud owner of a G4 dual powerMac. Interested to test drive a Mac? Visit MacStudio at Level 1, Ikano Power Centre, Mutiara D’sara, PJ, if you are in the Klang-Valley. Sorry folks, I only know KL locations.

       Czech Football anyone?  Now that most of the favourite teams are out, the most outstanding team to amaze every spectator with their never say die attitude and with a brand of progressive football has got to be the Czech Republic. Looking at the character they showed in the group stages and even with a comprehensive win over the Danes, the team is looking more and more like a championship winning team. Backed with the European Footballer of the Year Pavel Nedved, and with Liverpool players of Baros and Smicer, things are looking really promising.    Czech v Portugal  If there was ever a time, in all of the promising youth team that won the World Youth Cup of 89 and 91, the famously dubbed Golden Generation of Portuguese Football, then that time would be now for these ailing stars to perform. Many moons have passed, many, many moons, more than a decade to say the least, since promising the world so much and delivering nothing. After getting off to the worse possible start of losing to the Greeks, the team almost miraculously picked up the pieces and stitched their way back in it. That was evident when they beat their archrivals Spain.   The remaining obstacles  As every tale must have its twists and turns, it is now up to the men in orange and a Cinderella team that could ring the spoils on the Czechs or Portuguese. The prize for victory though, is something of a dream final ( or sought of since France and England are out ) that now looks promising for a toast to football. Two teams playing like there is no tomorrow. Both these teams playing for pride, honour and country, and the past anguish of all the heartaches and heartbreaks. For the victor, it is about seizing the moment for a place in history, all for many years to come as their names echoes in time.   Here on earth  BTW, for those of you who do not know, then let me introduce to you how beautiful the world looks through the UNIX driven 10.3.3 Panther. Words are truly a waste.

       What a double blow  Two mornings ago and it was a bitter heartache as millions of English foootball fans must have drown their sorrow in yet another penalty shoot-out. A game that promised  explosives and it delivered nothing short of high voltage energy. The game went down the wire and all the way to the shoot-out where in bizarre circumstances, though it seems to happen a lot in frequent years (since the 1990 World Cup I believe) that England go out based on luck. The whole ordeal meant that one of the most passionately supported teams in the world was leaving. But they gave their all...  Early this morning, not the same shall I say about the French team. Now these bunch of athletes are good, they are also in their prime (maybe Zizou is a little over peaked) but that is fine, what I'm saying is that they are good players. Class acts on the club scene. Many have won honours and accolades over and over again. But when it comes to living up to standard that people have now come to expect, they dissapoint you! What is this, are we to hope that you play better as an underdog? Seriously someone has to question their mettle. This bunch gave 50%, that too is overrated. Now they are going home.   Portugal v Czech Republic  It is now hoped that the host nation Portugal will meet the current in form team of Czech Republic. Centrestage, floodgates on, fingers crossed, please let there be a good ball game to watch.  COME ON !

       The world through higher resolution  Years ago, when I first started working, I stared deeply into the screens of those who had G3s. A few months later, G4s arrived in M'sia and the art team were the first on the list in getting straight to the distributor. The curious minds watched in awe at the display that would captivate more believers. I recall having first seen an Apple pc way back in my primary school days. I remember walking after school (SRK BB) to the Hospital where my mum worked, Assunta PJ, and they had their entire administration floor running on the early versions of Apple pcs'. Back then, MS was not even a buzz word. I remember during that time  karateka  was the in-thing and pc games were beginning to blossom.  Moving forward to the evolution of the Apple pc, my second hand at it was during college days where the entire computer room was filled with 7200s'. By that time a decade had passed and the world had come to know of the rise of the MS Brand. In a couple more years to come, that brand would eventually buy over the Apple. Distasteful as it was, there was no denying the changing of the guard. To some it was the end, for many others, it was a different beginning. Apple begin launching trendy and marketable pcs once more. The G4 soon followed suites of MS converted software that was capable of running on the Apple. Pricing was competitive and the Mac was once more placed as the branded computer (which is how it should always be).   From that time on, I have been anxiously awaiting the day I can rest my hands on an Apple keyboard and mouse. Ahh... and today is finally that day. After years and years of waiting, I'll be leaving my somewhat modified box for one that is ever ready to rock-n-roll. Finally, the word virus can be used only when I catch a bug and need to see a medical doctor. For the love of my ailing eye sight and clearer displays, the Apple is like the Ferrari of the computing world. Many do not know of its power (unless you are not into designing). That is why many do not know how to control it. For those who can tame the beast, it is like riding the numero uno...   In time I'll be saying  M-M-Mmicro  what?

       Mind blowing…  Who ever thought that the Sarah Brightman concert would have been another one of those boring classical sit and clap show piece must be way head over heels rueing the missed opportunity. The new age classical songstress dazzled the crowd with a collection of hits and performance that has left me in awe, till today.  Make no mistake, I’ve been to the local tea party scenes of our local bands, and I’ve also been to the Bon Jovi live in Shah Alam, Mr. Big live in Stadium Merdeka, twice to Scorpions live in Merdeka and Bukit Jalil, and even the recent Linkin Park live in Stadium Merdeka, KL. To my amazement, all those past experiences were without a shadow of a doubt half as entertaining as this one. The choreography, dancers and the band were far too good at pleasing the crowd that it left all in the stadium believers.    Standing Ovation  If thinking about the elevation and stage props, swings and all are too good to be true, wait till you actually hear her sing. Yes, that woman can really sing! And she’s not even close to being fat. At the age of 44, gosh, she could easily outfox most of our local foxy-ladies. That put aside, the fact of the matter is that her singing was precise and to the exact notes that you hear on her albums. My full and complete applause and standing ovation goes out to her!   That crystalline sound of her voice – certainly left me an already diehard fan with a memorable day in my personal history. The infusion of pop meets classical is something that many have tried before, but all seemed to fail – probably due to the lack of a solid and beautiful voice. What more when many of them lack the stage expertise of being entertainers...  A lesson should be learned from that day, and that would be to perfect the standard of our showmanship. Take it from someone who earns his ringgit. We pay our very ringgit to see a class act, and the least we expect to see is an act! Not some few blokes jumping around, or some band standing stiff like a log ( kayu ), or some fella moving like a squid ( sotong ). We want showmanship, go get yourself a choreographer and figure that out!

       So little time, so much to do  To a sports freak, what could be worse than missing the US Open Golf and Euro 2004 Soccer? To my disbelieve, that would be missing the  urlLink Indianapolis  Grand Prix, F1 that is. But since it's almost a forgone conclusion of the  tifosi  running away with a win, what's there to actually miss? Sour as a grape it may sound, I can assure you that I've never seen an F1 as boring as this season. The changing of all those rules simply played into the hands of the champs. Other teams look like they are well and truly behind schedule in adapting to even last year's changes. One can only imagine what's in store next season? Yawn....

       Antennae for cheap, do they actually exist?  The advertisement and article that mentioned the RM3.90 antennae found in our local electronic dealer sure got my heart jumping. I've been waiting and waiting for that darn cable tv to air live football and instead, all I get to watch is a talk show with live results on most days over our third channel. What is this about? We pay our hard earned money and what do we get? Not only disappointment, but the sheer agony of seeing them try to increase the subscription rate. Very good, like always, go ahead and blame the consumer for your lack of sales.    Back to the cheap antennae, ever wonder what happened to all of them? Been heading to different outlets on different days only to find their sales person go:   Day 1  Me: Excuse me, I was looking for your promotional antennae. Eh, really need to catch up with the big games. Salesman: Oh, the RM3.90 or RM9.90 one. Abang cari yang mana satu (which one)? Me: I was thinking I might need both, but nevermind why not show me the cheaper one. Salesman: Good choice, good choice. Every customer seems to want that.  Tapi , it's very much still blurry if you asked me.  Me: (Getting annoyed) Ok, then what about the other one? Salesman: That one out of stock.  Habis . Me: (Getting really annoyed) Ok, then give me the cheaper one.  Salesman: (shakes his head) Oh, that one also just only finished.  Me: What!? After all that talk you're saying you don't have one? Salesman: Abang try tomorrow. At the moment it sells like goreng pisang (fried fritters). Me: What about other outlets?  Salesman: Sorry la, all out. Me: (already frustrated)Ok, ok...   Day 2 - A different outlet  Salesman: Welcome boss, looking for what device? Me: Your antennae, the one on promotion. Salesman: Aww, that one, satu M'sia tak ada stock. (One whole Malaysia has no stock). Me: Good, good. Thank you. (Walks away happily knowing that I'll NEVER give my business to these half-past-six traders.)  That's it. No more heading to this misleading and cheap local products. They should see their strategy and compare it with that of a sidewalk trader. Even our local nightmarkets offer more variety than these bunch of jokers. For one, it is misleading to claim to have offered something that has no stock. And furthermore, it is ethically wrong to lie to your customer that one whole country has no stock available. What kind of invitation to treat is this anyway?   Hypermarts, why didn't I?  So I flip through the week's flyers from our local hypermarts and there you go, for slightly more, you get different models of an indoor antennae. Living not too far from Tesco, I decided to after dinner drive there and get myself one. Fair enough, they have different choices for the different quality antennaes. Needed just a normal one for this Euro season and M'sian idol.  Happily reached home and plugged the thing in. In no time I was being warped back to the old days where reception was blurry, and where the pictures become almost unwatchable once a bird lands on your antennae. But at least, there's picture and the sound is clear. That's lively enough and what can one expect, it's this or nothing at all.    Idol Part II  Antennae checked and just in time for the start of M'sian Idol part ii. This time, the venue had moved to Kuching, Sarawak. As usual, the Willy Hungs wannabies are flooding the participation lists. One after another contestants were sieved and as the show progress, more and more talented individuals begin to emerge. Throughly, I shit you not, talented individuals were beginning to show. This is good, this is what many have come to expect of what you can get when you have exposure and then nurture it. Not the same can be said about one really mentally unbalanced individual though. Half of my laughter and entertainment on an RM17 antennae now looked justifiable.    The other half  Mentioned earlier, the antennae was for Euro2004 and M'sian Idol. Now watching or rather listening to the telecast and it definitely feels good to be up to date with information. Feels real good....

       The spy cloak  Now looking at this  urlLink article  and the date that the initial invention was started way back in 1977, we can somehow get the idea as to how close Predator, MGS and Harry Porter got to presenting the idea. Even the visual effects look so much the same. But coming to where plans are on the way in developing see through walls, now that's a little too revealing for most of us normal folks.  I remember seeing a movie with one of the skinnier Wayan brothers in them,  urlLink Senseless  if any of you recall. And this loser of a geek had the worse of life until he decided to partake in an unsual experiment. Cutting to the chase, he volunteered to be the scapegoat. Nicely he injects himself with this blue liquid and begins to find that the experiment hyped up all his senses. In a couple of trademark Wayans twisting and screaming, he gathers himself and begans to take the added advantage as a cool gift.  Cutting back to the point that I was going to make, in this show he liked this girl a lot and with his new found super senses, he decided to spy on her from outside the toilet. At first he could hear conversations, ahh.... sweet and lovely, and all too lovely as he could even sense fragrances of other girls doing their make up in front of the sinks. Even the sound of lips being creamed with seducive lipstick was not to be missed.   So nice yet, before he could tell, other smells started to twitch his nostrils. His super senses was beginning to capture all those shitty stuff that we don't need to know. But wait, how do you turn that off? Well, of course you can't, not unless if the human body came with a battery and adapter, you probably could shut down. So the poor fella begins to even hear sounds as from where the smell came from, complete with sounds of things dropping into something like a pot of water. Pot, nay, go figure that out yourself.  The point is, there are things that all of us do that are done in privacy. That's life, that's part of being human. Take that away or start spying on that, and it'll only turn your sanity around. 360, in all dimensions possible.

       Anti climax  Looks like the perennial under achievers proved their mettle once more. This time, at home and in front of a sell out crowd of some fifty five thousand fans. If you are unsure of what upset this is, then think not of other than Euro 2004 and the host nation. I mean, how often have we seen them lose in humiliating defeats. Home and away, I wonder if it's some kind of a disease or something like that?   And then there was the M.Schumey show...  He's good, no doubting that but did anyone also notice how great his team is? The set up and that willingness to succeed is truly a passion. And it was very evident to watch how a Ferrari 3 and 5 could result to a Ferrari 1, 2. That's amazing. Hats off. It's a pity I wasn't born a  tifosi .   And on that very same day...  Zizou double snatches victory from the jaws of defeat. As expected, the team that was put together to hope not to lose, and at the same time can't possibly win has got off to the worse possible start. Though it looked very much like it was their's all along. Funny how every now and then we are reminded again and again how the ball is round and that anything can happen. Including the breaking of so many hearts...  Well done Zizou, thou truly is a master class!

       Yup, what a Heboh  Yes, I think that it's about time that our local media covers more local acts, and promote better advertisements, plays, events, and so on. I even notice serious heads turning when I mentioned ‘ Crumbs ’ by Disagree, a local KL act to friends who thought that it was some International band. Even noticed how the ex ' Akademi Fantasia ’ contestants are placing a standard for our local Willy Hungs to follow.   And that might just do the trick. It’s high time we let our young and talented shine or at least receive the right exposure and instead of walking around in complexes or being introverts and staying indoors sitting in front of the pc. Now I know that many would disagree, but sooner or later, you have to admit that nothing beats breathing a breath of fresh air. A rightful balance is what we’re asking for. If that’s not too much to ask.  Now, back to the healthy competition between  urlLink Fantasy Academy  and  urlLink M’sian Idol . Watched it yesterday on 8tv, and it was worth the laugh. The different talents, cultures, voices make this country unique. Sometimes, even we forget how blessed this space on earth is and take for granted that it can be replicated or simulated elsewhere. Though for now, all we hear are laughs, I’m sure that the result of these opportunities will result in a better and more presentable, showcase material winner.   So let’s be critiques, but let’s also be positive critiques.

       Updates, updates and more updates  Thursdays and everything seems so much like you just can't wait to pack your stuff and relax for the weekend. But not without sharing some interesting facts that happened over the week.    Venus has come and gone...  For those of you who don't read the papers, don't watch the news, don't read anything and don't have friends, let me so proudly tell you that you missed the aphrodite of your life. Chances are, you'll be long gone, dusted and how do I say it, six feet under before you next see another event like that. Thankfully though, you can still  urlLink catch a glimpse of that tiny speck making her way across the glorious rays of the sun .     Malaccan food...  Interesting to note that people way back then during the early days of fusion between the Chinese from China and the Malaccan Malays filled their hot sunny days with loads of cool coconut milk beverages of cendol and bubur cha cha. Though I'm not too sure myself what was used for ice, but I guess that's what makes filling up the imagination worth the while. What's more interesting to note is that how come so little people today find it so hard to figure out the best spot in Malacca to find the original bubur cha cha or even cendol?  urlLink This website  might probably do justice to those of you who don't know what Malaccan food is all about.   We won't settle for a draw, we'll beat them!  My, my, if i had a penny for every time I heard someone saying that I'll probably be rich, famous and a proud owner of a bunch of overrated and overpaid so-called stars. But wait, the secret weapon will only be unveiled hours before the game, keeping us all in suspense for the  super XI  that will march and vanquish all in its path. Now I'm a neutral and a fan of the beautiful game, and for all that it's worth, I honestly do believe that with the form of Henry and his muskateer friends, plus not forgetting the brilliance of a fading star, my money is still on  les bleus  to nick this one!    urlLink  More horses to the V10  ... I think I'll settle by the tele to the sight and sound of my favourite V10 engine this weekend, and not too mention the added horses tweaked into the revised Honda engine. As usual, I hope for the day that one of the two BAR drivers catch a first win, but it's funny how one can't drive as well as he talks, while the other is happier if the cockpit came with a mouse, keyboard and probably soundblasters instead! But, if there was ever a time to win, then doing it here in Montreal, in the very track named after Gilles Villenueve ( father of Jacques ), would definitely be it. Hopefully a win would spur him out of retirement and back into a race car and to winning ways. Two thumbs up to that happening. Fortunately, not the same can be said about our very own local bullockcart driver....    Say you, say me, say it together.... naturally  Finally, what could be more complete than our very own local deejays together with the real M'sian idol veejays giving a demo in search for the ultimate shower idol! Wow, and suddenly my drive to work has been filled with so much laughter once more, you just can wait to actually get a chance to see these people performing. Who knows, amongst the tempest sea of Will Hungs', we might just get one decent and not so bad an  idle  idol.

       Up and over the humpday  The weekend is the motivator and goal to life in any new organization. With more and more companies today implementing firewalls, watchdogs and filtering of all emails, why even bother to lift a finger to do anything other than the task assigned. What a boring life, sad but through. Luckily for me, a long, long time ago an old friend thought me his much anticipated wait for the humpday. And he being a real sleepy and hungry dude, I noticed that he always looked forward to the lunchbreak every Wednesday.   I thought that there was a special menu in Cyberjaya each Wednesday. Others thought that his personal life took a special twist every Wednesday morning. All of us was way wrong! Turns out, one fine day he spoke of how he froze his ass in the States for his degree. And being a bookworm and not coming from a rich family, he worked part-time as a librarian in the university. From then, he always waited for the mid of the week to pass before he could finally put his studies aside and work the weekends ( there's some ruling that says students can't be too engrossed in working or something like that ). Why the afternoon meant more was simply because it was the climb to the peak of the hump and by the time you are through eating, you'll be satisfied and heading for the weekend in due time.  Simple logic that works for many people. Even one as bored and as unsure of what to write on this Humpday. Probably that's why when a holiday falls on Wednesday, you hardly feel like you turned in a week's work.

       Black Monday  After being away for ten days, I was extremely sadden to say that I’m back to work and fully operational. And right from the start of the day, the darkness of a black Monday could have been felt deep down my bones. Just two days ago I was on the wane while my sorry bottom was tiring up on the eight hour bus ride home, only to discover that the realism of having only one day of rest, that being a Sunday and all – was excruciating!    Though the initial idea as to why I did it in the first place was still in tact, the break was meant to forgive and forget the previous working life I had. No mistakes made, the journey did help do just that. But now, a new chapter opens up and it’s a new beginning to the day I can hit retirement, yea that big double 5.   Kids reading this, though luck pals, life is almost, I said almost, all about the money!

       Oh my KL, the jam, the headaches, the pollution, the what!?  Yup, the one week dream is over. Bouncing from Langkawi to Satun Thailand and back again, has been an absolute blast. There are many things about our neighbours that remind us how much we've changed over the last 50 years or so, and how our marriage of cultures have diversified the people of the Malay archipelago in our country.   Looking at the way their people communicate, being myself a non-speaking Thai or Hokkien, it is very much alienating an experience as anyone can ever get. But then again, what amazes me most is the fact that they (the Thais) keep looking at us as though we are one of them. And luckily for us, one of my buddies could speak hokkien and mandarin, breaking the communication barrier.   Another interesting fact about them is that they are never bothered about us, though Satun is very much a Muslim majority state or region, their views on life are very much different from ours.   Here's a comparison list. 1. There's no preference on which religious background you come from in Thailand. 2. If you're a foreigner, any thai would fleece you. 3. Females there are very open minded to what's taboo here. 4. They are proud of what they have and boast that nothing has changed. 5. Because they are proud of their heritage, you can see that their beaches, land, etc are way cleaner than back here.

       Long time coming...  But it's finally here. After years of relying on the web from office, I'm finally with broadband. I know, I know, by right it should have been there a long, long time ago. But like they say, better late than never! Suddenly it feels like I'm at office even being at home.    Faster connection is definitely better  There are like a hundred and one things that you can do. Stream video, download stuff, compile music with iTunes, share files, etc. Maybe I can even start Warcraft sessions once more on Battlenet. Who knows?   What a weekend to look forward to  No F1, no projects, football is at a standstill. Smooth relaxing times with broadband and muh-babey quicksilver.

       NO satisfaction!  Seems like the RM100mil project for the anti-smoking campaign has not been able to deliver the results that mattered and instead have brought up cries of dissatisfaction from healthcare NGOs, according to  urlLink an article from theStar  today. One of the outlined dissatisfaction was the fact that the private company which has been entrusted to liaise with NGOs have not even contacted them yet.   Question, someone has been expecting a private company to contact the NGOs and report what? That after successfully villifying smokers that they (smokers) are now required to visit your organisations seeking help for quitting the habit? Get real!  Now, now. Why am I not surprised? Time and time again all that has been seen from public events on issues such as anti-smoking, anti-abortion, etc have focussed more on the negative instead of the positive. I do know that it is by all means easier to speak of the negative effects, for example that smoking has on both smokers as well as second-hand smokers. But almost all of us have someone dear to us who smokes? Do they deserve to be villified over and over again through advertising that's primitive, the bullet theory approach?   People are not animals. It is assumed that being the only species of mammal with not just intelligence, but also with emotions we would know how to deal with proper theories that do not even speak of villifying another being. It is already the 21st century, hello, wake up dudes.   Try another approach. Try being different. How about showing people how caring you are even if they smoke, but when you wanted to proposed something, their poor health stopped them. Why not inspire them to dig deep within themselves to want their health, life, passion, or reason for living a smoke-free life? Children love their parents regardless if they smoke or do not. Simple as that.  Make believe that smokers are not far from being able to swim in the bluest crystal clear seas, or climb the Kinabalu with their family and friends, or simply last the distance while playing badminton with their kids. Do that, give them a reason to believe! A reason for you in their world!   I come from the public relations, and hitting out at people's negative can be acceptable in military set-ups, not in daily person to person and friends to family environments.  If results are to come, then someone better start sharing this world. Even if that meant sharing it with smokers, dropouts, addicts, HIV infected, etc people. At the end of the day, we all have our problems, don't need anyone else villifying us for those problems.

      TGI FRIDAY! I've waited the whole week to finally see the weekend again. Boy oh boy, does it feel ever so good to know that the weekend is another 9 hours away. Considering that it's already there once I leave my office.  Don't look at me, but that's the culture that I've seen.  Cool ain't it?  MOVING ON The Copa America Final seem very much like the way it should be. Headlines for the match:  BRAZIL V ARGENTINA, or CLASH OF THE TITANS, now that sounds more like the balance of footballing power is back to normal again. Unlike the Euro tourney were we had Greek v Portugal, only to find the Greeks emerging as the champs. Translated into latin American, that would be something like 'Modest Venezuela beats the mighty Uruguays'...

       urlLink  iPOD – therefore I am    Now, hear ye! This little cigarette box size machine is no pushover at all. In almost a couple of years, the disk size of this micro-mini toys have gotten larger and larger to a point where it’s even greater than my 3kg notebook. Shelled in an assortment of colours and a really cool click wheel, the iPOD is turning out to be a handy way to boost your daily fashion repertoire. String it, pocket it, heck weighing just 5.6 ounces you could carry it in the palm of your hands. New versions of the iPOD cost $299 for the 20Gig and $399 for the 40Gig.  &nbsp;   urlLink  Big names bring big fame    In KL-city, the iPOD has not really reached the full frontal exposure yet. However, do expect it to bloom really soon. Imagine the people who have joined in the hot couture of being spotted with a cool iPOD; fashion great Lagerfeld, actress Gwyneth Paltrow, &nbsp;and almost every musician is behind this latest Apple revolution. Having already obtained my G4 Quicksilver, I’ll probably throw in the iPOD in my wishlist come this X’mas. Cheers!

       Under the weather  It was almost perfect. Had it planned the whole week as every aching limb on my body was desiring for the rainy weather to give me a peaceful slumber. It was pouring even on Friday evening that caused all sorts of jams throughout the city. The least I thought that would be visible was showers of blessings during the weekend. Instead, all I've got was a headache no thanks to the heat and humidity.   Somehow, someway, I get the feeling it's going to pour tomorrow afternoon.

       Blame it on the weatherman  Inaccurate weather reporters should be shot. Period. We want technology to be part of our lives. We want to be technology driven (or that's what I read about). When it matters most and comes to creating or using systems to better our lives, somehow, we fall ever so short.  Wondering people might not know this but, let me so happy to tell you a little greography of my hometown.   To everyone in who has lived here, it has come to our understanding that the weather is  panas dan lembab  or hot and humid.  The local climate is equatorial and characterised by the annual southwest (April to October) and northeast (October to February) monsoons, see  urlLink wikipedia . We have constant rainfalls, though our skies are not as grey as the UK, but we do have flash floods. Before I start to whine and croak, it's not something new that we are unaware of, though I reserve my comments for those behind the high-tech gadgets monitoring the weather.  Yesterday, in the heart of the city, the after office hour jam was at almost a complete standstill.  urlLink Flash floods  caused most of the motorist (including myself here) to end up in a inch-by-inch crawl. Amazing how some people never estimate the situation before hand. Every rainy day and it's the same outcome. Rain is equivalent to floods and that is equivalent to jams.  Let's summarise that last sentence, shall we.  *Rain = Flood = Jam . How difficult was that? Even a toddler can pick that up. Duh?! Seriously, I didn't buy a car to shove in a jam and let its shelf life depreciate sooner by constant overheating. Nor did I buy a car to sit in the middle of the largest parking lot from Klang to KL city. Plus, we are charged to endure this shit almost every other day with the countless tolls that we have.   On a lighter side, the hectic standstill did bring the best out of man and beast. Yup, apparently some 'carefree bachelors' were seen basking by the river banks along the Klang river. In this weather, of course they would be none other than our local playboys  urlLink the buaya tembaga (Crocodylus porosus) .

       T.G.I.Friday!  Is it just me or is everyone else moving in different paces? Gosh, with nights like these, shouldn't someone move the office hours later a little... Dang, fellas who have your own business, commiserate a bit-lah with us 'poor work-around-the-clock for stingy bosses' folks. Not only is the weather killing us during the nights, it rains right about 3pm when it's that time of the day that your eyelids seem to weigh a ton!   Damnit! Can't wait for the weekend to chill, hang out and get my default hours of sleep.   Adrian Newey to leave McLaren  Now this is news. Having spent all his days as an F-1 engineer specializing in aerodynamics, the sudden decision to leave the sport seems very much like what happened to Mika some years ago. Now, now, all too familiar here. Just when McLaren starts picking up the pieces, there goes another star? What the heck? Come on man, don't quit on us believers. We are dying now thinking that there's more to F1 than the  tifosi .  I cannot imagine. Or rather not want to imagine that the competition is getting smaller and smaller to the brink of diminishing.     urlLink Go read it here at bbc .

       Over the humpday  Good thing that the humpday is finally over. Earlier it appeared in one of the major press that if the drought continued, we would be running out of good clean water. Turns out that a week after I've read that, here we are under the glorious weather. It's as gloomy as it can get. What's worse, some of us have to wake up early in the mornings.   Wonders of technology  Ever wondered how things keep on getting smaller and smaller? Those days there was talk of this zip drive dominating the industry. Look at where they are today, hardly hear of their name being spoken of. It's as though, in such a short period of time, we have managed to not only use a USB port but create drives the size of a thumb. Soon we might even see smaller and weirder stuff in the computer world. Cheers to the interesting future we have in store...

       Monday blues are black  Tried ever so hard to not be feeling the effects of Black Monday, but sad to say I failed so horribly. Especially yesterday when there was almost a complete failure to do anything. From the moment I woke up, there was this sort of dark gloomy feeling hanging all over my head.   Time and time again, even with modified routines and modern day management, nothing seems to beat the Monday blues away. One makes no difference in this fight to liven up the situation. Been there, done that. Luckily for me, I wasn't the only nut falling asleep in the afternoon. Had noticed many others dozing off before me.  The worrying thing though, is the fact that so many people have trouble going through this day of the week, but somehow no one seems to be able to offer a solution. On the road, office, restaurants, etc almost everyone on this day acts mysteriously restless. Perhaps it's a semi-work day where your body is at work, while your soul is asleep at home.  BTW, it only happens when you start working. Shucks!

       The Saviola show  Two years ago,  urlLink Argentina bowed out  of the most prestigeous football tournament in an absolute disaster. No thanks to head coach Marcelo Bielsa for trying to turn the most beautiful attacking teams into a European based defensive team. The mistake of playing only one attacker of either Batigol or Crespo proved ever so wrong. What's worse, the coach never even thought of including the altar boy assasin. For the fans, it was agony.    Skim forward 2 years   urlLink Copa America . Same senario, same coach but with different heads. This time though, history could have repeated itself, but to the slice of luck that made head coach Bielsa include star striker  urlLink Javier Saviola . The little altar assasin took a while to get into stride, but in a 15-minute blitz, Ecuador was very much done and dusted. Argentina made belittle the South American neighbours in style. For a country with so much attacking flair and prowess, I most certainly hope to see more fireworks such as the 6-1 thrashing of Ecuador.    urlLink Ralf for Toyota   Not a toyol? Oh my goodness, why oh why? That one aim, one goal thing looks more like a modest cry from a non-profit organisation. Then again, I'm no genius of the sport. Who knows, maybe Ralf might turn the team into a championship winning team and out rival his elder brother? For all we know the rising star out of Japan might not even be Sato, but Toyota. Then again, maybe not.

       More football?  The champions of Europe have been crowned and decided. Immediately after that, the focus is now on South America with the Copa America. Gosh, to think that after a long nine months of pure footballing madness, one would be very much tired of it, these players are back to their kicking best again. No wonder some of them like Becks complained about the fitness level. Not to mention the few poor players who have collapsed and are now resting in peace. My question is why does sports have to hide behind the cover of currency and drive talented sportmen to a point of make or break? On that note, I see poor restless souls caught up in our footballing politics hungry for nourishment, but sadly, more money is being funneled to the canaries of Norwich. I do like the thought of them, but I also do prefer the thought of a resurgence in our football team.   This love  Every now and then, someone must come along my path and shackle me out of my skin with talk of mediocracy. Not meritocracy, mediocracy. Being too mediocre and probably benign. They want hardcore, grinding and not to mention bombastic words every time I sit and write. Well, breaking the cardinal sin of being taught most of the communication subjects and having sat through classes in the past like professional and technical writing, fear not believers, the only place I will bend the rules and allow jargon to waltz its way in my jurisdiction shall be here! Hence the new about. Besides committing such a sin would only make me feel as stupid as all those who think that being bombastic is all about the game... no, no, how wrong can you get!   Say you, say me, say it together...  There was a time, a time long, long ago that I believe hearing how people said "I love you" would put a smile on the faces of most bystanders. It would be even more remarkable to see elderly couples like veteran lovebirds walking hand in hand still chipping away at the same sunset or sunrise (though probably with thick glasses and glaucoma like eyes). You get my drift. Today however, I fear my drift is long gone. If what I've read in yesterday's papers was true, then the poor chap who defended his and his fiancee's honour of sticking to his guns by holding on to a prayer, must have died a martyr of today's modern day love story? If only those jokers look at themselves today. Hiding away and trembling in fear of facing the music. You don't sound so macho now do you! They couldn't even give two poor souls their break of saying "I love you". Cut some slack dudes, if you are so pissed with your pathetic bottom of the barrel life, go  play fish  or  drop that the bar of soap  with your boxing buddies instead of taking the lives of innocent people.    Bombastic, I do not have to  Wait, now you just wait and see. Good to note that this blog is very much only a fragment of my imagination. How relevant it is none of you can ever tell. And neither shall I. To me, that's one of the most beautiful facts of blogging. As I proceed in the next coming days, unless I begin to not recall what has been interpreted and integrated in my blackbox, my imperious wrath stands ready. The conjuring is complete.

       Disturbing times...  Seemingly today's trends of crime and vices are far beyond believe. To think that almost everyone that I've come across seem to have or know of a relative or friend that have been either waylaid or rob by a snatch thief. What is wrong with these modern day thieves anyway?   Pausing a second to think, what further shocked me was when I discovered that some people get the kicks out of seeing or knowing of a person's suffering. I cannot imagine someone sending and forwarding a video or streaming movie or some thing like that showing the beheading of a hostage. I'm not so sure for I deleted the mail thinking that it was junk.   Only to later discover that some fellas in my office with their speakers on were blasting the inhumane acts aloud. My, my... what kind of world is this turning to anyway? I never thought this kind of stuff is funny, and I still don't!   On one hand, we have M'sians who don't seem to give two bits a rats ass to watching a poor lady get robbed by a snatch thief, while on my other hand, even the corporate white collared dudes are amazed and thrilled by watching videos of execution. That applies to the young ladies watching as well. Gosh.... I don't think they even deserve to be called ladies or gents.   I feel like an alien today. Currently out of words and completely flabbergasted by the acts of some people I have come and forced to call colleagues.

       All hail the kings of Europe!  Zeus must be watching and smiling from above. It's almost a remake of the majestic performance that the Greeks put in on the very first day of the tournament. On a day like yesterday, one has to salute the Greeks for being the better team. They proved to the world that in Europe today, they are truly the best! Unlike the big 5. Shame on all of them for promising so much but never delivering. They got all our hopes dashed.

       9 out of 10 wins  As mentioned before, it is definitely a good time to be a part of the  tifosi . The winning machine and its driver are unrivalled and unmatched for the rest of the field. Never before since Freddie Spencer won both the 250cc and 500cc crown have I ever read or seen a feat so remarkable. In years to come, the records held my M Shumey might seem more and more an anstonishing feat and might take decades to be broken. Believe it, as it took almost half a century before Schumacher broke Fangio's records. My numbers may need correction but I'm sure you get my point.   Fedex Delivers again  After two rain breaks and only slightly over 2 and the half hours of pure hard-hitting tennis, Federer retained the Wimbledon Open title today by winning 4-6, 7-5, 7-6, 6-4. Unlike the earlier F1 telecast of a pure demonstration of tactics and supremacy, this one saw two equals throwing the best they had at each other. It was no easy task too, as Roddick threw everything he had against the Swiss. The decisive factor though, was what has now become a trademark of Federer's game, as the Swiss picked himself up from a set down to raise the level of tennis to over-power Roddick.  urlLink More...    Portugal v Greece  Big Phil may have renewed his contract and vowed to carry on as head coach of the Portuguese team, but we all know that what really matters is winning the game that is about to start an hour from now. The statistics also favour the host nation and a sizeable amount of fans will be backing their team all the way. Especially when a tournament like this has to be decided, the help of 55 thousand cheering fans does seem like there's an extra man on the field. All the best and may the best team win! What a way it has been to a normally morose and dull  Black Monday .

       Up and Running   Phew!  Finally got the whole blog running again. Could hardly imagine how complicated this new new design was to twist and tweak. Thankfully though, there was enough time for me to  urlLink witness the whopping of Serena Williams  in one of the most awesome and devastating tennis displays ever. Maria Sharapova, the new Russian pin-up girl, who since qualifying for a grand slam tournament meant that she officially had dethroned glamour girl Kournikova (in terms of tennis achievements). Looks cast aside, she really gave the world number one an  ass-whopping  with some superb backhands and lobs. Brilliant! Now let's hope that the men singles will be another brilliant display as well.  urlLink Wimbledon  truly brings out the best and the beast!    The Final fling for Figo and gang  Could this finally be the long awaited trophy that has been promised from the dawn of this golden generation of Portuguese players? Sure couldn't imagine the heartbreaks of them feeling twice shy after being bitten once. Considering that there are quite a number of the Portuguese following here in Malaysia as well. Very much similar to the celebrations found in that of  urlLink Goa, India .   Here we go again  Topping the news with weird and really awkward stories. If you haven't checked out the story on M'sian firemen, by all means make your way to the BBC website.  urlLink Click this link . It's almost an interesting prospect to think of that if a country like M'sia, could have a PR agency backing them, then they are doing a sort of weird job in giving us international coverage by rather different publicity and headlines. On the brighter side, it's at least an honour to say that our news are definitely not of disasters or chaos.    Formula 1 update  Pedal to the medal and it's going to be full throttle racing tomorrow as Alonso leads M.Shumacher in tomorrow's French Grand Prix of Magny-Cours. Do also look who's behind on the 2nd row of the grid, it's none other than Coulthard and Button. Well, well, well, the new chassis or engine might just throw a couple or two surprises tomorrow. At least it sure has today, or yesterday to where I'm blogging.   Hit it off like this, oh baby!  Yup, listening to my little baby spin up lovely tracks on iTunes is truly a pampering treat. Two thumbs up as I crank this baby up! Though I'm still lacking a whole lot for a wish list. One can only imagine how suffering it is to have to wait for an Apple monitor. No fairy god-mothers here, boo hoo...

       Euro2004 guessing game  Well who would have thought of it in the beginning? The minnows of the European football world has gone against all grain and prevail victorious. The only remaining hurdle remains like a simple task that they had earlier accomplished in the very first day and game of the tournament itself. The beginning is the end is the beginning? Definitely there must be another twist in the tale.... Watch this space for more.   Jumping bejesus  The mac is alive and kicking. The more you play around with the OS X Panther and the more you realise that there are a whole lot of things that could be done. For instance, with the stability of the UNIX system, there's hardly any crashes. Only one if I recall, and that was due to the silly fact that I tried my very best to load my old win32 address book in my mac. The silly thing purged into entourage and got it all shitty. But that too, was controlable as you can easily quit it without disturbing the life of other programs. Stable to say the very least.   Wish list  All I need now to complete my work from home setup would be for a colour printer, scanner and of course one those cool new displays. At the rate I'm going, I am not too sure on whether I might have to end up dieting for one month. Beauty does play its tricks on you.

       One foot in the final  I cannot imagine that the final is turning out more and more like I first imagined. No big teams. All upsets. In the end we are left to watch the in teams at the moment do battle it out on the field. Portugal is already in. Guess as much tonight the Czechs will end the fairy tale run of the Greeks. Though another twist in the tale wouldn't hurt anyone....   Wimbledon and still no Brit winner  Unfortunately, those who are always there at Henman Hill or some name like that must live to fight another day. Sad to say, the Henmania will have to wait yet another year to see him or any Brit winning Wimbledon. Somehow, and in someway, one has to really ponder the quote by one of the greatest modern day tennis players,  Pistol Pete , and his infamous "When I'm done with".  Obviously many at the post game conference were left pissed.   A different view  Make no mistake, the mac is a damn superb pc. After a week of using it, I'm just wondering why in the world I didn't get one earlier. You can't imagine how much more soothing the Internet is through a mac. Firstly, what's a virus to the computer. Then you don't have to worry about using your modem to download bugs and patches. But what I love most would be the fact that the time and space you roam in seems so different than before. It looks like I might have found my realm of reality to dwell in.... Not all who wander are lost, seems ever so true.

       Liver Pregnancy  This here is really weird. Considering it's the 14th case in the whole world, it surely is one rather eerie and disturbing image of a tiny foetes that was growing in the liver. Check it out at  urlLink ChinaDaily here . Don't worry, they have news even in English.   China News  The news from mainland doesn't seem too bad at all. Even their website looks rather impressive. Check out  urlLink Chinadaily.com.cn  if you haven't, will ya? It even covers news about foreign countries and one that I was reading which was on  urlLink Nairobi . You know, our local  urlLink Reshmonu  was singing  Straight from Kenya with the underground noise ... By the looks of it, they are almost or who knows already leveled the deficit with us.

       Way to go dude!   urlLink Apple's doing a Microsoft on Real Networks . How one can only imagine those poor fellas at Real Networks must be kicking themselves in the butt for revealing that they had broke the code too early. A couple of weeks ago Real Media announced the breakthrough which enables  urlLink realmedia formats to be played on the iPOD  as well. Considering that the iPOD is somewhat of a standalone monopoly of the music entertain technology, who can blame them for releasing such scathing remarks.    Realmedia for clones?  Now that Real Network might be sued and banned from touching anything Apple, they could in turn start looking for alternatives. It could well be a blessing in disguise as many other look-a-like clones are beginning to appear in the market. As always, when it comes to value for money, there's no better place to dominate than in Asia, especially here in M'sia where bargaining for the most optimum buy is a way of life.

       Boringgg...  Sometimes life can truly be a bore. You begin to realise that life becomes boring once you had surfed your heart out at work and by the time you're home, looking at the nice pc that you have doesn't even move you. Who can blame you when you have office mates sending stuff like  urlLink this one  out.    Tak cukup daging  Not enough 'char siew' is what I've been hearing these last few weeks. Well, well, well, suddenly it seems like people are beginning to realise that beauty is only skin deep. Including many of our so called K-economy business and even down to the individuals. By the way, lee your 'char siew' would be spelled 'cashew' like how you corrected me that day.
