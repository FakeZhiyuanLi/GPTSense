       Hi, I'm JX:  govenor of Pentabyte City.  Pentabyte is a developing city in the secretly located C3 state (known only to those VIP) where people will come to enjoy the blessing we call entertainment. Entertainment isn't all there is to it. Theat Pentagon is about fun, entertainment, ruggedness, the great life as i put it, and business. And don't underestimate the business part. Our city is based on the needs of the citizens. Since the citizens have no need for oblivious human needs our capabilities exceed those of other cities full of artificial humanoids. If you do not recognize the city or me through their writing I can further make it familiar to you. Remember Toy Town. Yes. And that young mayor Jerel Hall (This is personal stuff only I would know: a childhood to kidhood to manhood type of thing). That's me. Toy Town was full of real toy stars featuring Woody, Spider Man, Scott Steiner, Hulk Hogan. It was a real action city, and an exciting one at that. The city had moved to a new location and still was a big hit. After a while we lost Woody. No one knows the true story, not even I of all. Anyway another super star disappeared. After years I figured it was time for everyone to move on. I felt it had gotten too comfortable for them as huge stars to live for so long in one setting. Everyone one night left for good.  It was pretty cool while it lasted. We had a lot of excitement back when. We had Woody as govenor, and me as President. The WCW and WWF shows were big. The double TKO fights were remarkably for the history books. To the last days I was a big part of the formerly Crown Boas. There was a lot built, but not a lot to build on. As I had read in the bible and heard so many time thou shalt give up all childish things. I figured it was time to grow and let the action figures go.  Now there is a chance to start a new in my room. I am in college and get business and networking knowledge to be successful not only in my own business, but also to build upon a new city I recently (August 18th) enthusiastically named Pentabyte. This city speaking from a visionary point of view is going to be the most popular city ever built. It most likely will not remain at its current location in specific Plainfield, New Jersey. This place urges competition, lends opportunity and financial prosperity and enjoyment. As govenor I am happy to say that I can run a capitalist city the right way. Even though Toy Town was a great city it had very little order. There were many wars, destruction, mayhem many sometimes gang and drug related. There were no permanent officers or police. Basically the citizens were the police coming from such heroic backgrounds. But now I don't have those stars in my city. These people now are starting out normal and rocking their way to the top of the business and superstar world. Now there are only a couple of buildings for essential things such as technology, clothing, housing, business and fan stores( especially fan stores). Rest assured there will be much more.
