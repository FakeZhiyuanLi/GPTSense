      Alright, signed up with PhotoBucket.com and now have a pic on my profile and the nifty one above ^_^. My horse is fine :D. He'll be alright. Just have to give him some penacillin (gawd I can't spell) and drain the wound periodically. My step-dads dog got sick but she's alright now, I think anywayz. Other then that theres not much to say. I've recently become very involved in Astrology and learning as much about it as possible.       The Zodiac is truley facinating, AND I LOVE THE SYMBOLS, lol. This isn't the order of the wheel but the order of the Zodiac:   Aries  The Ram   Tarus  The Bull   Gemini  The Twins (MY SIGN!!! ^_^)   Cancer  The Crab   Leo  The Lion (Boyfriends sign!)   Libra  The Scales of Justice   Virgo  The Virgin   Scorpio  The Scorpian   Sagittarius  The Archer   Capricorn  The Goat   Aquarius  The Water Carrier   Pisces  The Fishes    I love the signs. Did you know Zodiac means Little Animals? I find that interesting ^_^ Didn't know that till recently. And that Aquarius is an Air sign not water ^_^ Thats new to me too. And that scorpio is Water :P CRAZY lol.

      I'm new to the whole concept of blogs. But I'm looking for something to use as a public online journal so I suppose this would be the place, no? The only disappointment I've had so far is that the site doesn't support uploading pictures. You have to use an outside account for storing pictures. PhotoBucket.com does just that but they're only accepting new accounts during a few hours in the afternoon so I'll have to hop online tommorow and set it up so I can add a profile pic to my blog among others. Anywho, I'll figure it all out. Well, its getting late, I better get off. I have to take a horse to the vet early in the mornin'. Poor thing. We spent $2,400 for this 4yr old whom I love ta death and named Alexander the Great ^_^, but yeah, he was sick when he got here, scrawny, bug eaten, headshy and halfdead. He was totally neglected. We had to spend a bunch of money in getting a rotten tooth removed from his mouth and now some of the bacterria from that thing made this big huge gross thing that ruptured under his neck. Anyway its WAY GROSS. Ick, ick, ick. We had to doctor it and drain it. I came like SOOOOO close to barfing my guts out from just the smell much less getting the puss on me. EWWWWWWWWW. Anywhoz, REAL NASTY SUBJECT sorry if I tramutized anyone. But we have to take him into the vets. At first we thought it might be strangles but after looking at it its not. Well gotta go. laterz.     If you want to see a pic of me go  here .
