       5/15/04: I started this blog so that I could express my opinions on controversial matters, without spewing it out to a whole list of email recipients who may or may not want to be involved. Instead of sending a lengthy reply to emails, I can just post my opinion here, and send a link by email. If people want to read it, they can, and if they don’t, I won’t be cluttering up their mailbox. I decided to do this, because I wrote a sarcastic reply to an email that was sent to Dawn’s and my main email address, and since Dawn sends most of the emails, some recipients assumed she had written the sarcastic reply, and she was very upset by the flaming emails we received that were apparently directed at her, not me. My first rant is vaguely related to the subject of the email thread that started it all. Please bear in mind that I’m about ¾ serious. If what I’m about to say turns out to be completely baseless, I will have harmed nobody but myself. But if there’s even a slim chance I’m on the right track, then some if it may be important. So here goes: It is my opinion that The United States is standing on a dangerous threshold. We are using the September 11 attacks as an excuse to use any means we want to bully the rest of the world, and even our own citizens, around. Iraq had very little if anything to do with the attacks, yet the administration bent all the facts to the breaking point or beyond to get us in there. [Standard disclaimer: this is not a defense of the despicable Saddam Hussein. The WORLD is a better place without him (though Iraq apparently is not, as yet)]. I agree that to force Saddam Hussein from power, the threat of force and ability to use force as a last resort was necessary, but we were a long way from a last resort. The administration has set a dangerous precedent by attacking another country before they had directly attacked us. Yes, at the time, most of us, myself included believed that they were a real threat, but they had not actually done anything to the USA. The administration must have had some powerful motivation, more than just the desire to help the poor Iraqis, to want in there so bad. That motivation could be oil- not that we would steal Iraq’s oil, but possibly to stabilize the region, thus assuring our continued access to the oil, and maybe to send a powerful message to OPEC and scaring them some by having a presence in the region. And I thought one of the big lessons we learned from our recent military adventures was always to have an exit strategy? It looks to me like we’re stuck with Iraq for at least the next 5 years! It seems to me that there is a real possibility that this whole situation could lead us down the road to fascism, whether intentionally or not. A large part of the world sees the US as increasingly belligerent, thus they become more hostile to us, which justifies us in becoming even more belligerent, and so on. The danger arises from the fact that there is now no other superpower to keep us cautious. We have the power to do as we please in the world, and it seems that increasingly we are finding justification to do so, and throwing away our own civil rights in the process. I may be crazy, I hope I am. But I think a lot of people are walking around thinking similar thoughts, and are afraid to believe it could be true.  It’s not so much that I think that’s what IS happening, as that I’m afraid it COULD happen, because all the elements are in place: we have an enemy to focus our hate upon, the USA-PATRIOT act to shut up dissidents with, economic stagnation here in the Homeland (that term struck me as a poor choice right from the start- it sounds too much like Fatherland), and nobody to stop us. But I started having these thoughts about the time Bush started beating the Iraq war drums, and I haven’t seen any evidence since then that convinces me it’s NOT happening. Here’s why I felt I had to subject you to my opinion. Sometimes I think about how difficult it must have been for ordinary Germans to carry on day-to-day under the Nazi regime. Most of them (I hope) must have hated the Nazis, but felt powerless to do anything to stop them. It must have weighed heavy on their conscience afterward that they allowed the Nazis to rise to power, and didn’t oppose them early on when they could have. If my fears prove true that we are in the beginning of a similar transition, I want to go on record as being against it, while I still have the nerve to say it. Then I won’t be able to chicken out later when it gets really bad. At this point, there doesn’t seem to be much else I can do to prevent what I fear may be happening, except vote for Kerry (that is, against Bush) and hope enough other people do the same to make it  harder for Bush to steal the election this time. I will close this screed with another statement that I want on record, so I can say I told you so: I won’t be the slightest bit surprised if Osama Bin Laden is captured in, say Mid-September to Late October, COINCIDENTALLY just in time to boost Bush’s approval rating for the election. If that does happen, please apply some skepticism.      Jeff's Rant  eggy99@comcast.net
