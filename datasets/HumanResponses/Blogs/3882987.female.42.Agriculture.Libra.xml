       urlLink    I had to make the 1/2 hour trek to town to get the boys ID's for their flight next month.  While there I thought I'd take some photos.  Here is one of our areas largest employers along with Hurd windows and Weathershield.  Ever wonder where your pizza comes from?  Well here it is.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Like my dogs, I teach my goat tricks to keep their minds entertained and sharp.  Here Richard is doing the goatie version of "sit up" and yes that is a dog cookie...he loves them!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Tex&nbsp; urlLink    First photo was taken this late morning when I took a walk up to the watering hole. On the edge of the hayfield are these round bales from last week's haying. My dog, full of energy, is always ahead of me sniffing out new trails.

      Welcome to my photo blog.  I've seen other photo blogs and was intriqued with the new "hello" picture adder so thought I'd try it out with this blog.  What I plan to do is since I am constantly taking photographs, I will share my favorites of the day here with you.  I'd love to hear any comments/questions or queries you may have.    The cameras I use are a Canon T50 with a Kiron 80-200mm lens.  I use almost exclusively Fuji 100 film.  The other camera is a Kodak EasyShare CX4200 digital my brother gave me when he upgraded.  It is a great little camera for those looking for one but for more advanced photographers it has its limits.  Here is a little insight about me.  I am 42, married with two teenage sons.  We live on a farm in NW/central Wisconsin where our main crop is hay and this year, corn.  I raise horses, cattle and angora rabbits and we have the usual slew of critters from cats and dogs to a goat and a guinea pig.  I am not a professional photographer.  I have loved shooting pictures for as long as I can remember and once in awhile I get what I consider a good one.  I've entered them in online contests and have won but they are usually prizeless which is ok.  I have also hung photos at our local gallery.  If I ever sold one I think I'd fall over dead, lol.  Anyway, I hope you enjoy what I have here...
