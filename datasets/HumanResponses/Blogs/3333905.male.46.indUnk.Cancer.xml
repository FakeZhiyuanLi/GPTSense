      Cali is a two-year old McNab mixed breed adopted from the Mendocino Humane Society. Cali is a skilled climber with cat-like agility and a terrier's rambunctuous personality. He can jump 5 feet in the air to grab a stick or frisbee. He has one big problem - Cali is a scariedy-dog. He is afraid of plastic bags, remote controls, propane tanks, boxes, or anything that makes noise. He is easily startled and inappropriately protective. Cali lives with his humans, a feral cat named Aggie and his best friend Winnifred, a nine year old Cocker-Spaniel mix.

      Cali's most recent journey was to the Mendocino National Forest. Cali loves the cool water of the Eel River. Take Highway 101 to Road 162 for a beautiful drive along the Middle Fork of the Eel River. Past Covelo, drive 16 miles to the Eel River Campground or if you like more privacy turn left at the Ranger Station on M1 to undeveloped campgrounds and off-the-road sites. The developed campground fills up on the weekends and sites are not particulary private. The Eel River campground does however have some sites with a view of the river and there is a river access trail on the South side of the campground.   There are other options for wading and swimming as well. Across from the Ranger Station is a small grassy parking area leading to a trail. This is a quick walk from the campground or use it as a quick stop to have a picnic. The access off that trail is well used but walk to most Northern point for the very best shady spot.   Cali loves Skinny Dip Hole. From the Ranger Station drive north on M1 a few minutes and on the left you will see a trailhead. The trail to Skinny Dip is about 1/2 mile long and steep in one place so make sure that you pack what you will need so that you don't have to walk back. This river spot is breathtaking. It is large with two swimming holes and rushing whitewater at the bend of the river. Bring an umbrella if you want shade though! And Cali saw a rattler the last visit so be sure to keep an eye on canines and kids!

       You know  CALI like in California. I have had to repeat this phrase over and over since I named my dog Cali, yes  really , as in California. My Dad still insists on calling the dog Collie. He wanted me to name him Terwilliger, after a street in Portland. Sit Terwilliger, come Terwilliger...just couldn't see it.   Moving is a big deal. Moving across country is a nightmare. Having arrived as a new settler to California from my home state of Florida, my German Shepherd dog of ten years promptly expired. I grieved for six months until one day my boyfriend, tired of my crying spells BUT supportive, drove me out Highway 20 to the Mendocino County Humane Society. There were three litters of puppies and seven adult dogs. We spent an afternoon crawling into the kennels when the staff wasn't looking and fondling all the dogs. One black and white puppy appealed to me. He was more "attentive" than his litter mates, easy to handle and had great markings. But I wasn't ready to buy. Besides my boyfriend thought we shouldn't do something on a  whim .  He  was eyeing a sand colored female lab mix in another litter.   It worked! My mind wasn't on my lost German Shepherd anymore. I was thinking about this new puppy. What would he be like? I wanted a female dog. Should I get this one even though he's a male? In the next three weeks we "visited" the puppies every four or five days. It became a pastime: watching for new dogs, ones that were coming out of quarantine and once in a while petting some cats too. Look at how large this one has gotten! What kind of a mix do you think this one is? My favorite continued to be the black and white. He and his litter mates had come down with kennel cough so the drama of his recovery compelled us to come back as well. On the afternoon he was finally "cleared" we finally left the Humane Society with a puppy.  I came up with a list of dozens of dog names, went to all those dog sites on the web and reviewed names until my eyes watered with fatigue. There were mens names, Indian names, weather names, place names, etc. on the list. I would email my boyfriend names and when he came home at the end of the day, we would look at the list and say the names, over and over...here Cheyenne, sit Dakota, come Zephyr. One day I was talking to a friend about my new puppy and my old dog and I found myself saying..."not my Florida dog, my California dog." This is typical of me and the result of over-education, generate lots of activity and finally having not worked it out intellectually in a moment of conversation have the AHA! "That's it, Cali! He's our little California dog." Not too original but easy to say.
