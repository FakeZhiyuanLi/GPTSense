       I am sitting here listening to a burned copy of Paul Oakenfold in Havana Cuba.  I have no idea when it was recorded but I know prior to 1999.  (I love how the 9 dips below the line) It brings back so many memories.  I miss that feeling of acceptance I used to find at early raves.  Complete and unadulturated acceptance.  There weren't any ulterior motives and very few judgements being passed.  Of course, it may have all been side effects of the party favors, but it was one of the happiest times in my life thus far.  Even with all the drama that existed between my mate and I, those moments on the dance floor, with colored lights washing over me and my eyes closed to the entire world, seeing only with my ears... that was heaven.  I came closer to my inner light in those seconds.. closer than I have been since.        My love for this style of music is so complete its difficult to explain or understand.  I find myself in it.  It can bring me to tears and back to ecstacy .... *sigh*

       So amazing... yesterday my post was successful after all. Sometimes I feel compelled to write but nothing flows. So I sit and force thoughts out and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I once read that if you are trying to write free flow that even when you are stumped as to what to write you should just continue to write, even if it is the same word over and over again, as eventually something will come.       But that is not what I am doing now.       I was extended a job offer this morning. Actually that is more like:   I WAS EXTENDED A JOB OFFER THIS MORNING!!!!       I am so happy... this is the beginning of so many things. I was beginning to doubt my desirability on the job market and really feel like the light at the end of the tunnel is rapidly moving further away. Right now, at this moment in time, it is hard for me to visualize a time when life will be easier and not so drama-ridden. When I will be single and I don't have to tip toe around my own home. When I will have a home. I have been searching in the wrong places, I think it is time for me to start building that home around me instead of waiting for a place to open up and take me in. Fayetteville may or may not be the best testing grounds for this theory but beggars can't be choosers, as the saying goes. :)       Now the issue becomes what to do with Kate for the next week until she goes to her grandmothers and then how to work out the vehicle arrangement. I am ecstatic inside but the rational part of my brain is still worried about all the details. Details, details, details... its all about the details.       *giggly*

       I missed your voice on the line last night.        Its true, I have a crush.  A million mile away crush and completely unrequited but its true.  For now it provides that rose shade that allows me to continue through the madness.  I suppose that alone is enough for it to be ok.        I am waiting to hear back about this position I have interviewed for.  I am very nervous.  This could change so much.  I have decided if this position doesn't pan out then I will be packing my bags and heading elsewhere.  Probably back out West.   Which wouldn't be such a bad fate after all, but I had hoped to stay here and feel semi-stable for the first time in years!  My fingers are crossed, my prayers offered and now all I have left is waiting.

       Sometimes when I am driving with the windows down, cool night air in my hair and the perfect song on the radio, I forget who I am.  I forget where I am... that this is not Arizona, that it is Fayetteville, NC.  I forget that my marriage is in shambles, I forget that I have failed in so many ways.  For those moments I am a perfect being of light.  There was never any other way I was supposed to be.        --I love it when life flows so smoothly from one moment to the next, with such ease and grace that there is no doubt a god exists and that at this very moment he (or she) is smiling at you.  Whether it is all a matter of timing or simply a state of mind, life can be so beautiful.        --Tonight on the way home I saw a woman and a young girl digging with sticks.  I saw two men talking by the tailgate of their truck.  I saw a young man and young woman enter a house unter the light of a streetlamp.  I saw a group of young men walking home with a basketball.  Each of them struck me with their beauty.  I felt some form of love for each and every one of them just for being.  Without knowing who or what they are in their day to day lives, they were perfect in my eyes and awoke in me a desire to be better than I am.        --I wonder where we come from.  When we have left our parents and our teachers and our friends behind, when we are all alone and still evolving, where do we grow from?  What pushes us to grow when no pressure is exerted from the outside?

       There was a lot of thought put into that title.  I was curious about revenge proverbs and in my research I found many interesting things:        "Revenge is a much more punctual paymaster than gratitude."  Charles Caleb Colton      "Since we cannot match it let us take our revenge by abusing it."  Michel de Montaigne         "And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe"  Bible         "Our sense of revenge is as exact as our mathematical faculty, and until both terms of the equations are satisfied we can not get over the sense of something left undone"  Unknown       "It is a revenge the devil sometimes takes upon the virtuous, that he entraps them by the force of the very passion they have suppressed and think themselves superior to."  George Santayan       "Revenge... is like a rolling stone, which, when a man hath forced up a hill, will return upon him with a greater violence, and break those bones whose sinews gave it motion."  Albert Schweitzer       "Revenge is often like biting a dog because the dog bit you."  Austin O'Malley       And what brought all this about?  I watched Secret Window last night, with Johnny Depp.  What a fucked up movie.  Of course, it is based off a Stephen King novel so that explains a lot.  The humor and story were actually not too bad and the ending was somewhat predictable; overall it wasn't a terrible movie, but not fantastic either.  All the same, the idea of killing your wife after they have left you is a little ... twisted.  There are times that I am not entirely sure my husband may not eventually contemplate similar actions... altho I have not left him for another man.  I suppose in all of us, there is a small, secret part that occasionally fantasizes about killing someone who has severely wronged you.        Anyways. I am off to a church to see about their pre-school program.  Honestly I think the church may be a little out of the way to make it a viable option but I will check it out anyway.  It will be nice to just get out and do something.  Doctors appointment this afternoon where I am already pretty sure what they will tell me but I have to go all the same.  And.... Dun-dun-Dun!  I have an interview tomorrow!  So.. this week is the most eventful week that I have had since I left Arizona.  AND!!! I am making arrangements to send my darling daughter to her grandmothers for a couple weeks at the end of August.... how I will miss her.. but it will be nice too, to have a break. :)       So now.. out the door.

      She is a bit touched I think.  That is the most interesting thing about my weekend I think, and that should speak volumes about the quality of my weekend. BORING.  Today, however, starting right around midnight, was a pretty interesting day so far. I logged onto Yahoo Chat for the first time ever and engaged in witty repartee with unattractive people like myself until the wee hours of the morning. I went into the Boston channel in search of a fella with a Boston accent * I am determined that my next relationship, if ever, will be with a Boston accent. * Instead I wound up speaking to an Irish accent living in Boston. Go figure. And while the Irish accent was pleasant to listen to... I still prefer the Boston accent. With the missing r's and everything. What can I say, I'm a sucker for it.  And today.. the woman that my darling husband practically chased out of the house with his rudeness called me up and said she would like to get together and chat and have our daughters play together again. Which positively thrilled me. I would love nothing more than a friend for Kate, a friend for me and the possiblity of creating a network here that I can depend on. Which would probably scare the hell out of the to-be-ex... but that's part of the point.  Still... the job search continues... rather fruitlessly I might add, but I am keeping my fingers crossed. Saying my prayers, all that. I am halfway considering going to the strip club here in town and applying as a waitress.. simply because I know they will hire me!  *sigh*  I need to save me ...

      And I thought they only had these on LJ.. *contented little sigh*  Wackiness: 38/100 Rationality: 56/100 Constructiveness: 40/100 Leadership: 38/100  You are an SRDF--Sober Rational Destructive Follower. This makes you a font of knowledge.  You are cool, analytical, intelligent and completely unfunny. Sometimes you slice through conversation with a cutting observation that causes silence and sidelong glances. You make a strong and lasting impression on everyone you meet, the quality of which depends more on their personality than yours.  You may feel persecuted, as you can become a target for fun. Still, you are focused enough on your work and secure enough in your abilities not to worry overly.  You are productive and invaluable to those you work for. You are loyal, steadfast, and conscientious. Your grooming is impeccable. You are in good shape.  You are kind of a tool, but you get things done. You are probably a week away from snapping.  Addendum, 2004/07/19: this fits me 99%, there is a slight inaccuracy however. We are not necessarily completely unfunny. If we have a sense of humor (I do) it surfaces on the occasion with well-timed, completely dry, very sarcastic, wit. - Chase   urlLink  Take the quiz HERE

       There are some days when reality seems just a little too surreal to be reality. Take today for instance... my daughter calls to me from the living room "Sorry Mom, for throwing your movie!" She has thrown my DVD at the wall... when asked why she threw it in the first place she replies that she is practicing throwing her hover-disc. She doesn't have a hover-disc. She's never had a hover-disc. I sent her to her room for a little while but my heart wasn't in it. How in the world do they come up with things?       My husband is off his rocker. He comes home this morning and announces that he has been listening to a CD and has realized all His forgotten priorities. And Whala! Everything that has gone on the last several weeks is instantly forgotten. Suddenly He is requesting I attend counselling again and sign up for babysitting services through the military and telling me He loves me and kissing me on the cheek when He leaves. Holding hands and shit. Where in the world is this coming from? Have I falled asleep and slept through a time warp? I don't get it and I am beyond objecting to it because at this point I am willing to tolerate a little hand holding if it gets me through the next month with minimal bullshit.       My little prayer of the day. And everyday. Please God, get me out of this house before I become as psycho as my husband is. Please.

       I love Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Some of their songs give me this feeling of..   We are destined to fail from the onset and knowing this from the beginning, we struggle on anyways.    I mean, take this lyric:      I got dosed by you and    Closer than most to you and    What am I supposed to do    Take it away I never had it anyway    Take it away and everything will be okay        Maybe it resonates differently in me that others but I think not.  Hopelessness and despair are in right now.  Hell, they have been in for ages, it seems.  As long as I can remember, granted I am young yet.        So. I am out tonight doing laundry and sweating my ass off  (which is good because I am on my period and feeling snack-ish.  I probably gained 15 pounds today alone!) and I get the urge to post to my blog.  I think, hey, there is that whole email thing you can do... I want to give it a try.  So I connect to the web on my cell phone and go into Messaging.  Damnit, I am limited in the number of characters I can transmit.  So this bums me out but I half expected as much.  So I think from now on, posts on the go will be reminders to myself to extrapolate at a later time.  I should have done that this time but I was so bummed I couldn't even think.  Yes, my blog means that much to me.        And, what, you may ask, was so important that the simple inability to post it drove all sense out of my head???  Actually it was about Men & Motorcycles.  Or, Boys & their Toys.  Whichever you prefer.  No clever alliteration for Crotch Rocket.. bummer.  Anyways.. I am seeing many girls riding around on the backs of bikes lately.  This always causes a twinge of jealousy to shoot through me.  Which is strange because I am terrified by the idea of being on a bike.  I don't really even want to date someone who has one... I guess I just want to be the type of girl who attracts those kind of individuals.  But is that really a type?  I don't know.  I wasn't all that impressed when my husband took me for a ride in our dating period.  More like scared shitless, desperate for the ride to be over.  My grandpa used to take me for long, slow rides on the back of his cruiser.. But I liked those rides.  He felt safe and stable.  Husband just felt reckless.  Anyways.. this is a lot of type devoted to such a silly subject.  I will stop rambling now.  I need to retire eventually tonight and I could sit here and contemplate the contradictory nature of me for hours.  Days even.        So adieu.

      Or something like that.   From this point forward in my journal any use of "He" with the capital 'H' will refer to my husband.  Any other forms of "he" will simply refer to whomever I am speaking about at that time.   Now that that is settled...  HE  dumped out all his alcohol this morning.  This is a fairly common occurance.  He will get piss drunk and storm around the house in His inebriated fog and curse at me and tell what a worthless individual I am.  Last night He wanted to know what I felt my purpose was.  I have developed my own methods for dealing with this.. primarily to keep silent and not make eye contact.. similar to how you handle a wild dog I suspect.  Sometimes He backs off, sometimes it seems to enrage Him more.  Last night it seemed to do both.  He stormed out of the kitchen yelling that He hated me, screamed "I hope you fucking die, WHORE!" and locked Himself in the computer room.  About 30 minutes later He emerged and left the house.  I halfway contemplated calling the police and reporting Him for drunken driving.  But honestly, I think I halfway wished He would get pulled over and stuck in the tank for the night or even, God forgive me, that He might just wrap the God-damned car around a lamp post and all my problems would be solved.  I know its terrible but I can't help it sometimes.  Anyways, the booze is gone this morning so I guess there isn't much chance of that.  He apologized in his fucked up way... "I'm sorry for what I said, I didn't mean to hurt you but its all true."  I don't even think about it anymore.  It the same shit, different time of day.  Morning, noon, night; it's all the same.  Nothing ever changes and nothing ever will.  It doesn't matter what the circumstance, the result is always the same.  I have to get out of here.  Period.   Not much else to report elsewhere.  This journal will be terribly self-centered but so what.  I am so tired of being told that I am too selfish.  Somebody show me one person who will look out for me so I can stop being so damn selfish and I'll show them someone who will eventually stab me anywhere they can to hurt me.  You can't trust a god-damned person in this world to forever be what they present themselves as.

       Or not.       I am not entirely sure who I am writing this for.  I am not telling anyone about it.  At least not yet.  There are things I wish to say that I don't always want other people to know about.  Or at least I want to seriously restrict the access to the deepest darkest parts of me.  But then I go and do something silly like, post those same thoughts on the internet where every stranger and their brother can go and find me.  I guess maybe it is a cry in the night for someone, anyone who can truely get me.  I could never look someone in the face and tell them every single thing I would write anonymously in a blog.  And so I exist, day to day, in all my interactions, convinced that no one will ever truely know me.  That I can never honestly trust someone who says they love me because deep down, I know they really wouldn't if they could just see all the craziness that burns inside me.        Right now I am somewhat trapped in a very unhappy marriage.  I have slowly surrenderred control of my existence until I have come to this point.  I am not sure how to get it back and I am terrified because I don't know what to do once I do.  What if I fail?  I suppose that is the timeless question that haunts every one of us at some point or another, but regardless, it is paralyzing.  Not to mention, I am stuck in a small two-bit military town that sucks for work and sucks even more for good people to hang out with.  I had a brief fling with another military man/boy a few weeks ago after I realized my marriage was over.  I began sleeping on the couch and I just want that tiny feeling of control and satisfaction that always accompanies sex.  Instead it made me feel even more out of control and worthless and all those other fun feelings when it ended.  Even in looking back I'm only sorry it ended the way it did... I wish I had been the one to grow tired of it first.        I guess in a way I am shutting down emotionally.  I can't handle all that I am feeling right now and I am just tired of trying to sort it all out.  So I'll bottle it all up, become as cynical and hard as I ever was, and deal with it all at my own pace once I have established myself in other realms.  Meaning, once I have work and some idea of how in the hell I am going to get out of this marriage.  Because that's all I really want right now.  To be independent and single.  I mean... there are other things that have to be considered... Some people would call me selfish because I don't appear to be considering my daughter too much in this decision.  All I have to say is, in order to be a good mother, sometimes I have to make decisions for me that may not appear to have much to do with her.  Right now I know I am not providing the kind of care she needs and deserves and is even used to.  I hate the person I have become.  The only way I see to find the me I know I am is to get back out on my own and take control of my life back.        So maybe this is the exploration into that process.  Maybe it's just an online journal for me to vent in.  Whatever.  Either way, in a year, I'd like to look back over it and congratulate myself with how far I have come.  I'd like to think that in a year the overly pink background I chose will reflect a more parallel image of my attitude instead of being the farthest opposite I could find.  If anyone finds me here and follows me through my trials, I hope they like what they see.  If not.. I'm sure they'll drop off eventually anyways.
