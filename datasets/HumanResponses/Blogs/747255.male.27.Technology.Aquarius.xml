						   With my warm friend on my lap I sit upon my throne contemplating being.  From this cold, damp fixture I can look over every one of my subjects.  My kingdom is vast with borders afar.  I feel regal. But I feel the end is near.  I have poured out all that was within me for my throne.  None but I will ensure my purity so I must see to it alone.  I've but recently knighted a subject, Sir Whipple; purveyor of fine linens.  His gentle sheets shall see my end.   [Written 12/25/2003 8:05PM]

						   Everyone wants to be famous.  Or everyone wants to be a writer.  I know, we all want to be rich.  Perhaps everyone wants to be a famous writer named Rich.  That can't be right. No. A rich famous writer. That's it.  I guess it's a good thing we can't all have what we want.   Like what you want. Want what you can. Have what's left.

						   I have to say I agree with you  About telling the future of air  That it's going to do  What it's going to do  Wherever I am when I'm there.   But pretending I know  There is no chance of rain;  No way it is going to snow  It confuses my brain  And eases the pain  Of going where I have to go.

      My recruiter told me to stay out of trouble.&nbsp; I was shipping out to basic training in two weeks, and all of the paperwork was done; if I got so much as a speeding ticket, it would screw everything up.&nbsp; I figured I was a pretty easygoing fellow, so staying out of trouble should be easy, right?   I tried to have some last minute fun, went crazy and saw some concerts with my friends.&nbsp; Saw Elvis Costello with the Crash Test Dummies, Huey Lewis and the News, and even Kenny Loggins (thanks to the State Fair).&nbsp; That was great.&nbsp; The last weekend before I was to leave, my oldest friend, Brian,&nbsp;came up with tickets to Jesus Christ Superstar.&nbsp; Hot dog!   Now,&nbsp;Brian and I had known each other since at least seventh grade, when we sat next to each other in band.&nbsp; In all that time, he never expressed any desire to learn to drive or to saddle himself with the expense and bother of owning a car.&nbsp; Until now.&nbsp; We were going to travel across town to Gammage Auditorium to see Jesus Christ Superstar in his brand new - to him - 1978 Honda Civic.&nbsp; He had, inevitably, dubbed it "The Beast."   I lived in my parents' house in the extreme northwest of Phoenix, and Arizona State University is in Tempe, located to the southeast of Phoenix.&nbsp; About 40 miles in The Beast.   We made it, and parked, and waded through the picket lines.&nbsp; About four nuns were marching with signs that said "Don't Make Fun of My Lord" or "The Savior Isn't Silly" in front of the theater.&nbsp; A couple of fundamentalist types were standing off to one side smoldering at the Catholics for trumping their own demonstration.&nbsp; It made me nervous, and I planned to head for exits on the other side of the theater if they started rioting.   The show was great, though they went a little overboard with camp during&nbsp;Herod's scene.&nbsp; Herod was dancing around in a leather S&M suit, smacking his butt and vamping around Jesus, who stood stoically at center stage.&nbsp; We were discussing the possibility that if the picketing nuns had actually seen the show, they might have appreciated knowing that it wasn't Jesus that gets made fun of,&nbsp;but this conversation died a quick death when we got to The Beast.   The Beast had developed a problem while we were enjoying the show: three flat tires.&nbsp; One of them was the spare.&nbsp; After a bit of head scratching, we decided to limp the aged monster across the street to a filling station and try to inflate them.&nbsp; Our plan was to see how far we could get before they went flat again, thinking we could leapfrog across town from air pump to air pump.&nbsp; The only danger there was in running out of quarters.   Alas, after filling them up, they were flat again after half a block.&nbsp; We debated turning around to go back to the filling station when I recognized the neighborhood we were in, and suggested that we stop at Bronwyn's place.&nbsp; Bronwyn (or "Bronnie-poo", if you prefer) was my former roommate.&nbsp; He had returned from his summer in South Africa to attend ASU, and had set himself up in a tiny little one-bedroom place not far from the campus.&nbsp; We invaded his house, and tried to phone Brian's dad to come and rescue us.&nbsp; No answer.   "It's alright," said Bronwyn.&nbsp; "I'm borrowing a car for the summer.&nbsp; I'll just run you back to Glendale, and you can come pick up The Beast tomorrow."&nbsp; Brilliant!   So, we piled into a tiny little two-door contraption belonging to one of Bronwyn's classmates, an exchange student from Bangladesh named Anwar.&nbsp; Anwar had left the car, but no insurance or registration documents, apparently, which we learned as we cruised down the I-10 out of Tempe.   "Well," I said, "just don't get pulled over, because I can't afford any trouble this close to shipping out."   Brian was dejected.&nbsp; His "new" car was a bust, and he was fuming over the possible costs of getting it repaired and back to our side of town.&nbsp; As he fumed, he smoked Camel after Camel, flicking the ashes carelessly&nbsp;out the sunroof.&nbsp; Most of them made it out of the car, but I had to duck a few stray cinders that blew back into the microscopic back seat, where I had folded myself.   We were cruising down the road, laughing at our own absurdity, when I began to choke on smoke.&nbsp; It didn't smell like cigarettes, though.&nbsp; I looked down, and saw that it was pouring out from UNDER the driver's seat.   Bronwyn noticed it at about the same time, and began furiously changing lanes, trying to get to the side of the road.&nbsp; We careened through eight lanes of traffic, screaming as smoked poured out the windows.&nbsp; The car finally stopped, and Bronwyn and Brian leapt from the car like it was about to explode, leaving me stuck in the back.&nbsp; I frantically reached around looking for the latch that would release me from the charbroiler I was trapped in, and realized that there was no way out.&nbsp; I heard yelling from outside the car, and heard Brian fumbling around, trying to rescue me.&nbsp; I slipped, and landed head first on the floor of the car, which was littered with papers, and came eye to flame with the smoldering upholstery.   Then I saw salvation: a water bottle!   I unscrewed the cap, and tried to dump the contents on the glowing edges of the carpet, but couldn't fit the bottle under the seat. I tried pouring the water into my hand, but there just wasn't enough room for manueverability. Somehow, though, I managed to soak some of the papers and stifle the flames. The thick, plastic-smelling reek began to clear, and Brian finally managed to work the latch and hauled me out by the ankles into the relatively fresh air along the side of the highway.   We sat on the berm looking down at the car for a long time, making sure the smoke didn't start up again, and watching for emergency vehicles. Four cops passed us, and didn't notice three smoke-streaked college guys with panic-stricken eyes sitting there on the side of the highway.   Then, I guess since these tragedies happen in threes, Brian asked, "Where are my keys?" After a brief search of the car, he looked down at the road... And saw there, eight feet down in the only sewer grate for ten miles, the glint of metal from his keys.   By the time we got to his place, we were dirty and desperate. We only wanted a drink, and a soft couch to collapse into. I figured I'd stay on the couch and call my folks in the morning.   Except that we couldn't get into the house. Brian's parents were gone, the house was dark, and not one car sat in the driveway. We just looked at each other for a long&nbsp;minute.&nbsp; Both of us were probably thinking the same thing: This will be funny in a few years.   In the end, we didn't get caught breaking into his house, which was a good thing, since I was supposed to be staying out of trouble.

      I'd had&nbsp;a terrible year.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It would have made a great country song if I had changed the details.&nbsp;&nbsp;My girlfriend completed a rather drawn-out breaking up process, my roommate went&nbsp;home to South Africa, I lost a great job, and my Datsun's transmission failed on the way home from Tucson (where the now-ex-girlfriend had given me the boot).&nbsp; I ended up&nbsp;moving back into my parents' house, which had shrunk in the 9 months since I had moved out, and walking the five miles to work at the Wards department store in the mall. &nbsp; Things dragged on, and steadily drifted downward from there over the summer.&nbsp; I had a&nbsp;brief affair with a girl I didn't like, which alienated&nbsp;my best friend because he DID like her.&nbsp; My parents anxiously brooded off-stage, hoping I would pull my head out and grow up.&nbsp; Basically, I&nbsp;could do nothing right, and wasn't sure&nbsp;how to turn&nbsp;it all&nbsp;around. &nbsp;  I still had my dignity, though.&nbsp; Well, maybe not.&nbsp; But, as the&nbsp;song says, Ob-la-di Ob-la-da... and something about a bra.&nbsp; I mustered what professionalism I had, and tried to&nbsp;figure out how I was going to pay for another semester of school&nbsp;by working in housewares.&nbsp; The job itself wasn't bad. &nbsp;It was a step and a half up from the bottom-feeding drudgery of telemarketing, or the series of grocery stores I had&nbsp;been working&nbsp;at for seven summers, and I was able to deal with people cheerfully day after day.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, I&nbsp;became the "problem" guy, which didn't mean that I was causing trouble.&nbsp; Any customer that&nbsp;one of my co-workers couldn't handle would be thrust my way as though I had some imaginary authority.&nbsp; If I may brag a little, I was good at it.  &nbsp;  One lady, for example,&nbsp;was&nbsp; a regular problem; she would bring in all of the&nbsp;junk mail she got every two weeks like clockwork.&nbsp; Because she had a store card,&nbsp;a large portion of that mail&nbsp;was from Wards, and she seemed to think that we were personally stuffing all of&nbsp;the envelopes there in our housewares department and sending them to her as some kind of personal attack.&nbsp;  &nbsp; She was wheelchair bound, immensely fat, and&nbsp;also a&nbsp;victim of throat cancer - which had left her with one of those voice boxes that generates a horrible&nbsp;mockery of human speech.&nbsp; Her husband acted the part of the tall, gaunt, and silent&nbsp;valet who propelled her wherever she wanted to go under a fusillade of unintelligible, computer-generated barks from the voice box.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever was at the counter when she arrived would be met with his blank, fishy stare and her robotic tirade compounded by the added assault of stacks of unopened fliers, circulars, coupon books, pre-approved applications, and full-color advertisements being hurled at the counter top.&nbsp; Ivariably, they sent for me, because I could understand her.&nbsp;  One afternoon, while helping two flamboyant homosexual men in matching ruffled leisure suits select throw pillows for their couch, I heard&nbsp;the bi-weekly cyber-attack starting up&nbsp;on Michelle, our newest employee.&nbsp; "Chintz!" I said, tossing an armful of pillows at the indecisive couple, and whirled to Michelle's rescue, leaving them to argue in lisping Spanish over magenta versus burgundy.  &nbsp;  "NGET&nbsp;UZ OVF YERR GODDAMNG NGAILING LISZT!" &nbsp;I heard, followed by the soft thump of mail on formica.  &nbsp;  "Let me help you, Mrs. Foster," I said, smoothly.&nbsp; She wouldn't be happy until I&nbsp;"called corporate" and set them straight.&nbsp; I dialled Gary, the owner of the tobacco shop next door, and told him in no uncertain terms that if he didn't remove Mrs. Foster from our mailing list, I would testify in court that he&nbsp;wore women's undergarments and abuse&nbsp;zoo animals.&nbsp; Or something like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Foster nodded solemnly and eyed a pile of toaster ovens.  &nbsp;  Meanwhile, a man had wandered over from the&nbsp;lighting department&nbsp;with a set of almost-matching lamp shades.&nbsp; I tried to ignore&nbsp;the brewing storm&nbsp;as Michelle began to argue with him about the price that came up on the register.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had my hands full appeasing the Robot Queen. &nbsp;  "You got the cyber-twins over there?" Gary was asking on the phone.  &nbsp;  "Yes, sir," I replied in my sternest tone, "And if you don't stop sending them our fliers,&nbsp;we will lose their business forever!"&nbsp; (They had never bought a single thing from us that I was aware of.)  &nbsp;  "Hee hee, thanks for the warning!" Gary said.&nbsp; "I'll take my break&nbsp;before they get here!&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't feel right selling her all those&nbsp;cigarettes!"  &nbsp;  "But the sign says '20% off', and it's sitting there with these shades," the man was&nbsp;insisting to Michelle.  &nbsp;  "Well, it's ringing up at $10 each, that must be the sale price," Michelle said.&nbsp; She was casting me anguished looks, begging to be bailed out.&nbsp; &nbsp;  I hung up the phone, and turned&nbsp;back to the Fosters.&nbsp; "If you get any more mail from them, you let ME know," I told them, and sympathetically dumped their&nbsp;letters into the trash bin.&nbsp; They rolled away,&nbsp;satisfied until the next mail delivery. &nbsp; "Help me get rid of this guy," Michelle whispered at me behind her hand. &nbsp; "Why&nbsp;don't you just give him the discount?" I asked.&nbsp; "It's only two bucks." &nbsp; She paled at the suggestion.&nbsp; "Not on MY&nbsp;account!&nbsp; Won't they fire me for that?" &nbsp; Not wanting to argue in front of him, I turned to the man with the shades.&nbsp; "Where&nbsp;was the sign, sir?"&nbsp; He showed me; it wasn't supposed to be there.&nbsp; It wasn't even one of our signs; some&nbsp;joker had brought it over from one of the other stores.&nbsp; This guy didn't care about that, though.&nbsp; He by-God wanted those lampshades, and he by-God wanted a deal!&nbsp; I just wanted him to go&nbsp;away. &nbsp; So, I logged in on a register, rang him up - with the discount - and took his money.&nbsp; "You have a nice day, sir," I said, as sincerely as I ever say it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just between us, whenever I say the word "sir", it has a special meaning in my mind; an acronym suggesting a profane act combined with&nbsp;criticism of the mental capacity of the one being "sirred."&nbsp; Unless,&nbsp;of course, I respect you. &nbsp; The man smiled, and cocked his head to one side.&nbsp; "You know," he said, "that showed a great deal of professionalism and leadership.&nbsp; Have you ever considered a career in the military?"&nbsp; I demurred, without laughing.&nbsp;He handed me a business card.&nbsp; "I'm an Air Force recruiter down at the Processing station in downtown Phoenix.&nbsp; Give me a call sometime, and&nbsp;we can talk about getting you out of retail."&nbsp; I politely tucked the card into my breast pocket. &nbsp; Dad picked me up from work that night, and asked how my day went.&nbsp; I was dying for a cigarette - nasty habit I had picked up in my wild days of&nbsp;bachelor living - but didn't want him to know I had ever so much as seen one lit.&nbsp; I reflexively brush the breast pocket of my shirt, where my smokes had formerly resided, and remembered the card. &nbsp; "I was offered a job in the Air Force," I said, laughing. &nbsp; Dad didn't laugh. &nbsp; Coming Soon: How Did&nbsp;THAT Happen, part 2:&nbsp; Off to Basic Military Training

      Anyone who spent any time in the mid-90's in Monterey, California, may remember the reputation of Bruce Archer. He was generally well-liked by everyone, but he did have one little personality quirk: in a squadron of 700+ college-age military trainees, he was a notorious drinker.   The vast majority of our student body liked to party, but he stood out. When other people would go to the bars in town, they would usually order a beer. Sometimes a pint. Bruce would order a pitcher. Then he would ask whoever he was with, "Do you want one, too?"   Generally speaking, he didn't let this habit affect his Air Force career. Okay, it would be more accurate to say he didn't let the Air Force interfere with his drinking career. You could guarantee that every night, from Friday to Sunday, he was going to be publicly intoxicated. Holidays and "Blood Days" - we were given a day off from class if we donated to the periodic blood drives - would allow him to extend his drinking time further into the week.   The collection of Drunken Archer stories grew over his vast tenure at DLI, especially when he was rolled back. Usually people were only rolled back for academic reasons; if they couldn't keep up, they would get transferred into a class that was two months or more behind theirs in the program. Bruce was rolled back because he had an un-descended testicle that the USAF had decided  must  be removed. This extended his stay at DLI by almost a year after recovery time,  convalescent leave, and finding him an open seat in a new class in his language.   Meanwhile, his adventures continued. His favorite trick was to get himself obliterated, and then evacuate himself in some inappropriate place. When Bruce was drunk, he would piss and crap  anywhere, as the spirit moved him. Pun intended. His squad-mates complained to him frequently about not urinating in the flight laundry room. James went so far as to ask him to use the washing machine, as it was easier to clean than the dryer. This led to a knock on James' door in the middle of the night: it was Bruce, asking for some laundry soap so he could "flush."   Perhaps his greatest moment came when he was staggering up the hill from the Enlisted Club one Saturday night, and felt his bowels beginning to move. He was on the tennis courts, about half-way up to the squadron from the E-Club; he couldn't go back there, since they had just closed. He didn't think he'd make it up the hill, and he didn't fancy squatting there in the open on a moonlit night. So he did what anyone in his position would have done; he snuck into one of the front yards of the officers' quarters that bordered the tennis courts.   As he did his business behind a bush under the picture window, he noticed that the car parked out front looked familiar, and he squinted at the name on the mailbox: Guillanara. He realized with glee that he was shitting in the Air Force commander's yard! He proudly told a captivated audience this tale while sitting on my couch at a party sometime later, and then promptly fell into a deep sleep. We, of course, rolled him outside to keep him from taking a dump in our oven, or someplace even worse.   Then there was the incident with his roommate, Morgan Waldo. Morgan was a good guy, originally. I have to admit that I started him on his slide into sadistic cruelty by stealing his girlfriend, or so he believed. He was even more crushed when I married her, but it wasn't me that pushed him over the edge!   One weekend, just before the monthly Monday morning inspection, Waldo was livid. It was Sunday night, and Archer was still, typically, MIA, presumably at the Mucky Duck, or Characters.&nbsp; Waldo had to clean the whole room by himself. Okay, he didn't HAVE to, but he thought he'd fail the inspection if Bruce's junk was scattered all over the place.   About 3am, Archer was poured out of a cab, and the dorm guard on duty rousted Joe, the flight commander, and another poor sap - both were volunteer student leaders, I must point out - to drag Bruce down the hall to his room. As they did so, he woke up, and began flailing about. He only settled down after bouncing his head off the laundry room doorknob.   They pounded on his door, waking Waldo, who had only just gotten to bed after cleaning, sweeping, and re-waxing the floor of the room. They all dumped Archer on his bed (the bottom bunk, fortunately) and Waldo attempted to get back to sleep. Just as he drifted off, he heard something, and turned on the light.   He saw Archer standing in the middle of the room, spraying copious amounts of urine all over their shoes, which Morgan had lined up neatly along the wall under the window. Waldo launched out of the top bunk, pummelled Bruce on the back, and shoved him toward the door, shrieking "No, you stupid bastard! Get out of here to do that!"   So, Archer opened the door to the room and gamely obliged by whizzing out into the hallway. He finished as Waldo danced a jig of rage behind him, and then lay back down to sleep - on his desk.   The desks were side by side against the wall, so while Bruce was trying to rest his banged-up head on his desk, his feet were on Waldo's. The problem here was that Waldo had a shelf unit on his desk, which was loaded with books and language tapes, knick knacks and CDs, and other neatly tidied junk that tends to accumulate on such shelves. Bruce kicked the whole mess onto the floor.   Hearing the crash, Waldo rushed back into the room from the hallway, where he had been frantically mopping up piss with a pair of socks. He screamed again, heaved Bruce from the  desktop, and threw him onto his own bed, from which he did not budge for three and one half hours.   Those hours involved Waldo with reassembling his desk shelf, and re-shelving all of his stuff; cleaning urine out of his shoes; re-mopping, re-waxing, and re-buffing the floor of both his room, and the entire length of the hallway. (He would have only done the pissy places, but his screaming had awakened his squad leader, who assigned him the whole hallway as "punishment for causing a disturbance.")   At 0649, Waldo finally finished cleaning, and went to try to shower and get ready for the inspection. Alas, the cleaning detail had already finished cleaning them, and he was kept out. Thus, he stood inspection in an unkempt, unshaven, and smelly state, having been spattered with urine, sweat, and floor wax during the night.   As TSgt Beale was writing up Waldo's inspection paperwork, Archer came staggering out, clutching his head. It had swollen so badly that you could see straight into his ear while looking  him in the eye.   "Airman Archer," said TSgt Beale, "Are you alright?"   "No, sir," replied Archer. "I think I hit my head last night." He looked every inch the victim of some horrible assault.   "You'd better get to sick call, right away!"   Waldo watched him leave through a gauntlet of sympathy for his wounds, and slowly ground his teeth at the injustice - sick call got Archer out of the inspection.   Two days later, Waldo was volunteering to become a student leader. Asked why he wanted to be one, he said simply, "Revenge."

      (all names have been changed to protect the guilty)   The Smoke Deck was the center point of social life for everyone in the squadron at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA.  Even people who didn't smoke would go there as soon as their duties for the day were done just to put in an appearance. Some were fresh out of Basic Training, and glad to spend their 20 minutes of freedom outside; some were "sharking", which involved circling amongst the newbies, looking for one that would be easily wowed by the "seniority" of someone who had been there for as much as three weeks already. I know of several young men who got their first dates this way.  I was one of those who went to smoke. I had never been more than a pack-a-week kind of guy, but just being able to go out and have a smoke after eight weeks of stress and mind games was a temptation that I couldn't even think of resisting.  It was October, a month after I had arrived at DLI, and I was lighting up a couple of stogies to celebrate being allowed to wear civilian clothes again. I was relishing my flannel shirt and Detroit Tigers baseball cap (I've always been a big Magnum PI fan), and I had on a pair of jeans that seemed much looser than they had last time they were worn, four months before.  Bert came up to me, took the cigar I offered, and said, "I got someone who wants to meet you."  Then she stepped out from behind him.  "Hey, aren't you the guy that can put a quarter up his nose?" she said.  "Got a quarter?" I replied dashingly.  She laughed, and to make a long story short, by February we had decided to get married.  Of course, most of our friends were scandalized. After all, DLI technically stands for "Defense Language Institute", but in the Training Command it was also known as the "Defense LOVE Institute". Our squadron had the highest marriage rate in the service, and Goodfellow, where we all had to go for our follow-on training, had the highest divorce rate. The odds for a marriage like ours were not good.  Maybe that explains why I was more nervous about telling people about the wedding than I had been proposing.  Most people who heard would offer flaccid congratulations before moving on to more interesting subjects, and most of my close friends seemed worried when I told them.  But not Glenn.  He became visibly excited at the prospect, and his first words were, "Can I throw the Bachelor Party?" So I said, sure.  When the big night arrived, we borrowed my fiancee's Saturn, and swung by the liquor store on our way to the motel where the festivities would be held.  Glenn had outdone himself.  He'd secured a suite under the name "Nick Nefsik" (Arabic for "F*** yourself") which had a kitchenette, and a balcony overlooking the Chinese restaurant behind the motel.  People started to show up, and we all started to get blasted and watch porn. A typical night, for most of the guys, and a bit boring.  Then someone suggested getting a stripper. Everyone ponied up a few bucks, and Don Law (whom everyone called "Dong") went to work with the phone book.  She showed up about half an hour later with her bouncer, a beefy, sullen woman that stood in the corner of the room watching us watch her friend, and the fun really started. At least, until there was a knock on the door.  Apparently, there was an Air Force girl in the room next door with her boyfriend, an Army sergeant. I probably don't need to point out that their relationship was not legal, but I will.  They didn't let that stop them, though. They were so upset about all the noise coming from our room, that they came over to do something about it.   First, the guy came to the door and demanded to know who the "ranking NCO" was at the party.  Dong explained that there wasn't an NCO in charge of Bachelor Parties, but that the stripper would be leaving before 10:30pm.  All we asked was a little patience.  The guy seemed to agree, and left.  The Stripper was quite good. She zeroed in on the Bachelor (me, of course) and did a very naughty dance, which I wasn't able to fully appreciate because I had misplaced my glasses, and was totally obliterated. When she was done with that, she made a little pitch about needing extra money to play a game called "Feed the Kitty", after which everyone bolted from the hotel to find the nearest cash machine. This was fortunate for most of them.  While we waited for the bank roll patrol to return, the Stripper disappeared into the bathroom (where my roommate turned out to be hiding in the tub), and a few of the guys had gone out on the balcony for a smoke.  Fred Kreigler was by the window staring myopically at the porno on the TV, when there was a knock on the window behind him.  There were about a dozen guys in the room, and I was by the wall dividing the bedroom area from the kitchenette when Fred pulled back the curtain to see a grinning death's head with a chin divot and a hair-line that was retreating like a Redskin's defensive line.   "IT'S SERGEANT KNIGHT!!!!!" he shouted... and mayhem ensued.  I don't know who opened the door, because Kreigler swore later that it wasn't him. Maybe TSgt Knight really was the supernatural being we all thought he was.  That night he burst through the door, and grabbed as many people by the back of the shirt as he could reach. The stampede flowed by me in my place against the wall, and I stared stupidly into the panicked faces of my companions followed swiftly by the leering, gleeful face of retribution.  When the dust settled, there were about six of us left in the room with TSgt Knight, wholooked around the room, smirking and braying threats into our faces.  The Incarnation of Death was turning to each of us and trying to find out from us who had escaped off the balcony.  "So, who booked the room?" he shouted. "I want to know who 'Nick Nefsik' is."  We were trying to make it look like we couldn't remember, but we were really just trying to figure out who we would have to turn in. I remember reluctantly giving Glenn's name, but tried to make it sound better by pointing out that he hadn't bought alcohol for anyone but me.  After much soul-thrashing, we managed to come out with only five names of people we were pretty sure he'd already seen. He had to be satisfied with that.  Then it occurred to our Ranking NCO that one of our drunken runners might have gotten hurt diving off that balcony, so he sent someone around to see. Sure enough, he came back with Dong draped across his back. Dong looked around the room blearily, whether through pain, inebriation, or both. He looked hard at TSgt Knight for a few seconds, then burst out, "Who invited THIS asshole?"    We all froze, and our blood ran cold as the smile of the Grinch crept across his malignant mug.  TSgt Knight leaned back, took a deep breath (as we held ours)... and laughed!  "You're alright, then, Airman Law?"  In the end, it turned out pretty well. Nobody got into too much hot water, though a few of the people there had been student leaders, and had their positions of responsibility taken away. The two underaged guys (including my roommate) were put back "on phase", which meant they had to keep a curfew and stay in uniform all the time.   Most importanly, my wedding went on as planned.  My lovely, new bride was mad that I had worried her so much, but I was forgiven for not actually causing any damage to either our plans or her car.  Fortunately, I had been able to convince our apprehender that I should stay at the motel that night, since I was unable to drive it.  Glenn showed up after everyone had been dragged off, and he helped me clean up the room.  "I'm sorry your Bachelor Party got busted," he said.  "I'm sorry I ratted you out," I said.  "That's alright. Everyone knew I'd set it up; someone would have told on me," he forgave me.  "Where were you, anyway?" I asked. "How did you get away?"  "Well, when everyone else was going off the balcony, me and Duke hopped over the dividing wall to the balcony of the room next door. We lit up a couple of smokes, and just watched.  TSgt Knight didn't notice us, so we slid down the drain pipe. I've been at another party down at the other end of the motel."  Typical Glenn!  And the chick that turned us in? We made sure everyone knew she and her boyfriend had made the call to TSgt Knight... including her husband.

						   I've been thinking about this one for a little while and I don't really see why not. Maybe it would make some people more comfortable if it was called something other than marriage.  urlLink Today President Bush called for an amendment to the Constitution to protect the sanctity of marriage.   The wording of "sanctity of marriage" doesn't really work for me. I can't find a quote directly attributable to Bush using that wording but his  urlLink press secretary said exactly that.  It's the definition of  urlLink sanctity  that bothers me. It means "holiness" and I don't think it's our governments job to create law based on a religious belief. Every religion in the country doesn't feel the same way about homosexuality.  Anyway, that's semantics... not what I really wanted to post right now.  I haven't heard a good argument against same-sex marriage. I understand that some people don't agree with that lifestyle. I understand what the Bible says about homosexuality. I also understand that people can make their own choices about how they want to live their lives.  While forming an opinion on this issue I was thinking about the gay people I know. One of them had a really hard time figuring out what to do with himself. He grew up in a Christian home where it was taught that homosexuality was wrong but he had these feelings. He tried to be straight for a really long time. He fought with his head what his body was telling him. Now he's openly gay and is probably happier for it. Anyway, what I'm getting at is that I think homosexuality is a natural phenomenon. I think for the most part it's not some artificial choice people make for some outside reason. I really feel that their chemistry tells them who they are. I don't think people should fight that so much. If you feel gay, be gay. Whatever.  So with the understanding that homosexuality exists and will forever exist we move on. Gays and lesbians fall in love just the same as the rest of us. I don't think our government should penalize them because they can't or won't understand that. If two gay guys want to live together and merge their lives into one I think they should be entitled to everything my wife and I are entitled to. I think they should file taxes the same way we do. I think they should be able to get family health insurance at the same saving we do. I think the state should license, join, anul, dissolve this union the same way they do with a straight couple.  What social purpose does it serve to ban these people from signing a contract to merge? Your religious preferences have no place in this debate at all. You can't argue for the protection of your children either. Gays will exist whether they marry or not. In this country that boasts so loudly about our freedom, why are we only going to stand up for the freedoms of the countrymen we agree with?  I support gay marriage even if I don't feel gay. I support flag burning, even if I think you're opinions are ridiculous. I support free speech even if I hate what you say.

						   One down, one to go... and then some...  Tonight I turned in one of two term papers due this quarter. He was looking for 12 pages but there was just no way I can put together that much on home network security without putting together 50 pages. This topic is either an essay or a book now that I think a little more about it than I did when I picked the topic.  I was in the middle of a fight with a Linksys 802.11b wireless router that wasn't performing as expected so the topic was fresh on my mind. The problem I was having with the router... Well, I could leave the thing wide open with all the default factory settings (read come and abuse me) and it worked flawlessly. But as soon as I started using WEP or WPA or MAC filtering I would have to reset the thing several times a day just to connect to it. No good. I called Linksys tech support a couple of times. It met my expectations... some non-technical phone jockey flipping through flow charts. No good. I'm sure that type of "tech support" is fine for problems that are not related to a product failure or firmware flaw... but I wouldn't know from personal experience since I don't pick up the phone until it's at that level. Anyway, Linksys told me the router was bad and needed to be replaced. Since it was still under warranty I went through the RMA process and decided to have one cross shipped. At least that way I could still fight with what I had while I waited for the replacement. When the replacement finally arrived (2 days late) I was excited to be back up and running without problems. That fire was quickly snuffed out by the flood of crap from the Linksys product line I was using. I had the thing plugged in for about 2 minutes before I started having problems. It now sits in a box or something... somewhere... I don't care... It doesn't work. Chuck it for all I care. Donate it to AmVets... tax deduction... yippie... how much is blue crap worth these days? I went to Circuit City and bought a 802.11g Microsoft router. I never thought I'd buy a MS router but it was a decent deal with decent features so I thought I'd try it. It works very well... I set it up and only had one glitch... I had used channel 2 originally but it seems one of my cordless phones didn't play well on 2 so I moved it up to 11 and it hasn't missed a beat yet. There's only one thing I don't like about it... the web interface for configuration. It's ok but too Microsoft. I think they should have built two interfaces... one for the everyday home user who wants a wizard for everything and a second for me and all the other geekoids who like to know exactly how everything is set up and change one little tiny piece of it  for whatever reason.... Maybe in a firmware update... Maybe in a dream...

						   Is the republican national commitee running scared?  urlLink CNN.com - RNC�tells TV stations not to run anti-Bush ads - Mar 6, 2004   The RNC may be right and MoveOn.org may be wrong. I don't know. But if the current administration had any ground to stand on for this issue they probably would just come out and stand on that very ground and fight back.  Too tired I guess to write much more about it right now. I've been sitting here staring at the screen for about 5 minutes trying to put words together but it just isn't happening.

						   I am.... so bored.  Sitting here at work with no real tasks to do. Sure there are a couple of things that could be done, but if I did them then I'd REALLY have nothing to do. I'm not sure what's worse... Having nagging tasks that I don't really care to do or having nothing at all.  It's not really going to be a great week for me. It feels like Monday because I took yesterday off to celebrate my daughter's 3rd birthday. My parents are in town, too... all the more reason to stay home. We always have fun, usually going out to eat. So I'm already nearly 2 days into the week. I have two term papers due by the tenth and I haven't really started writing either of them. I've written an outline (sort of) for one of them and I'm not even sure what topic I picked on the other... Wren and Bernini I think. I also have a short quiz to do online and probably homework from the class that I accidently skipped last night because I didn't realize it was Monday. It didn't even hit me that I missed the class untill this afternoon.  I'm not really interested in anything I'm currently involved with outside of my home-life. We're building a new house but it's not started yet. I can't wait until that gets going... it will give me something to look at other than the news. I'll be getting a new camera soon so I can take higher quality pics of the new place under construction. The digital camera I have now has got to be about 5 years old. It takes just OK pictures and it's too slow. I really don't need a new camera. It may not even be fulfilling to get a new one but I feel like I have a good excuse so I might as well get one and see if it makes me smile.  The weather channel says it's 70 outside right now. At least it's cloudy so I don't feel so bad.  Gil just asked me how to deal with stupidity. Now that's a tough question. At this point in my career I try to seek out the ones I already know aren't stupid and we work things that way. If I can't find that I just let stupidity run its course. I don't care enough to put the effort into chasing down crap anymore. Since it doesn't get me anywhere why waste the time and energy just to make it look like I'm trying really hard?  I left the car with my parents today so they'll be picking me up soon. Guess I'll start the 10 minute walk to the visitor center.

						   When we move from Odenton to New Market (both in Maryland) this coming fall there are some things I'm going to miss... mostly being just about 7 minutes from work... But there is one thing that I will not miss at all.  Tonight there is a helicopter orbiting at between 1000 and 1500 feet around what seems to be the east side of Fort George G. Meade. Actually, tonight it looked like there may have been 2 out there for a little while but there's so much air traffic out here it's hard to tell. But right now there is just one. I don't know exactly what the operation is. This all really started back a few months ago when all those flights from London and Paris were cancelled due to some terrorist threat. It seemed that every time there was a flight that had been delayed into the Washington D.C. area (BWI, IAD, or DCA) one of these helicopters would do the orbit for an hour or so. Could be a coincidence... who knows. Anyway, In our first house we lived pretty close (a few hundred yards) from a neighborhood frequently visited by the county police with lights and sirens on... I know what a police helicopter looks like and I know what they look like when they're searching for someone or something on the ground. They orbit at a much lower altitude than these guys are and they usually have a pretty bright light shining down on the ground. I know they have newer technology than a big light but they still used the lights pretty often in the old hood. They would also stay in a generally small area and do a search pattern until they decided they weren't going to find anything or they ran out of fuel. These guys hover at one spot at the east end of Fort Meade for several minutes and then move to a spot at the south end and stay there for several minutes and then they sort of run around the west and north ends (what seems like for less time) and start the whole routine over. The first time I noticed them out there they had a spot light on but they weren't scanning the gound beneath the chopper but they had the light shining several miles out as if they were scanning the horizon. Acting more like a light house than searching for anything really...  Anyway I don't know if they're guarding the Fort from some threats or if it's just an exercise or what... but I won't miss hearing it.  Thinking about this reminded me of the couple of days right after 9/11 when all commercial air traffic and general aviation was grounded. We were still hearing aircraft, but not at all what we were used to. Fighters were doing orbits around DC and Baltimore and since we sit right in the middle they often would pass right overhead. They flew day and night and at times it was frightening. We'd be laying in bed sleeping and then suddenly we'd hear the thunder of an Air Force fighter zipping past. Sometimes it would sound like a formation of them going over and other times it would sound like they were going back and forth right over our house. They're so loud it sounded like something was going to crash into the house. Adding on to that, when air traffic did start moving again the pattern at BWI seemed to have changed. Instead of being in the arrival path we started seeing departures fly over our house... a much different experience because it looked to us like the planes were going the wrong way (since we were used to them decending and heading toward the airport... It looked like they were still decending but not toward the airport...)  Anyway, we're a little more paranoid than most people we know. We're actually the only ones we know that have emergency stuff ready to go. We have a couple large duffel bags and a box of stuff that would only take us a minute to load into the Jeep and hit the road. We have food, utensils, cooking equipment, fuel, heat, sleeping bags, toys for our daughter, water... radios, batteries, lights... basically everything we'd need to head for the hills for several days and not rely on anyone else. We try not to let the Jeep get too low on gas so we don't have to worry about filling up if we need to leave in a hurry. We have a .45 ACP pistol and ammo ready to go... I'd really like to get a rifle that would be a little more practical. The pistol is no Desert Eagle... it's not very well balanced... there's no porting or anything like that. It's labelled as a compact. Basically, it's difficult to handle. I'd rather take off with a .22 LR and a couple thousand rounds. At least with that I can fire ten rounds really quick at whatever and then switch magazines. In the time it takes to fire those 10 rounds I'd probably only be able to squeeze off about 3 with the .45 with the same accuracy.  Anyway, the new place is far enough away from everything that we shouldn't see this kind of activity with regard to the helicopters....

						   Have you ever tried to chase down your past only to find out nothing was what it seemed. Or maybe it seemed like nothing to you but to others it was something more? Last week I sent an e-mail to a singer who performed at a youth camp I went to in 1987 or 1988... I was basically just trying to find out if he was the performer or if it had been someone else. Anyway, I wasn't quite sure of his response. I wasn't sure if he was just being sarcastic or was sincerely bitter. If he is bitter about whatever happened that summer (which I've sent another e-mail tonight trying to find out) it just adds another log to the burning pile of distrust and doubt that's accumulated around me regarding the church.  I really don't know what to think anymore. I hardly know myself. I don't have any burning desire ... well... for anything. I think back to my teen years (I'm just 27 so it's not like it should be so foggy) and remember (barely) some of the things I used to do. I'm not sure what really compelled me to do the things I did regarding the church. I was probably labeled a fanatic by most people who chose not to associate with me (most). I wore t-shirts with Christian messages... Carried a bible... Talked about Jesus and salvation and grace and forgiveness... on and on. But thinking back on it I can't really say it was religious conviction that led me. Peer pressure and fear is really what it seems like from this angle. I went to church on Sundays and Wednesdays (Baptist). Some of the most beautiful girls I've ever known were members of the church I went to so that was a plus... And maybe being churchy was what I thought they wanted in a guy so that's what I wanted to be. I remember a retreat we went to one summer... There was some big exercise we did regarding death and final judgment. I ended up in hell. Most of the kids in there didn't think much about it but it really bothered me. I ended up sobbing like a baby about the whole thing and by the end of the night I felt like the ministry was what I wanted to do with my life. I can't explain why and I don't remember anyone ever asking either. I read about the catholic church during the renaissance. The church controlled everything.... Who got to learn how to read... What they read (bible)... and on and on. And I think about the bible. How has the bible changed over time. Who decided how things would be interpreted. Who decided what parts stayed and what parts went? Man, of course. But the faithful tell me that these people were inspired by God and acted on His will. But they all thought they were inspired by God and acting on His will... Back in January Pat Robertson said  urlLink "I really believe I'm hearing from the Lord it's going to be like a blowout election in 2004. It's shaping up that way."   In case you didn't know he's talking about Bush winning in a landslide... God told him that. I don't know.  I don't go to church anymore. I still feel like I'd eventually like to find a church to go to and be comfortable in, but I don't know why really. For friends? I don't need church to have friends. Besides, I like to watch R-rated movies. I like to drink beer and wine... rarely to a drunken state but I like to drink. I like to discuss things that some people in the church would rather not. I don't need friends from church for all that. You don't have to be a churchgoer to be a good person. The only thing you have to be, to be a good person, is a good person.  Sure, our nations laws may be based on judeo-christian tradition but are they not also common sense? Or do they seem like common sense to me because I was raised in a Christian church? Likewise, does Catholic tradition seem strange to me because I was raised differently. I think so. I think Catholics interpret some of the things the bible says very strangely. But they think the same about Baptists. But I digress... Really though, don't all religions teach that it's basically wrong to kill and steal and do bad things? I mean, they're BAD things...  So Jesus is the redeemer and God knows everything... I am given a decision to make, the outcome of which defines the destiny of my soul. Do I accept Jesus as the Redeemer? Does God know what decision I will make? If I don't know the decision I will make until it is made, is it still free will? Maybe I just won't decide. But to be indecisive is to have decided not to believe. So when one decides not to follow Jesus and they keep with that decision until death the soul is condemned to hell. How? Does God create for the sake of creating? I don't like to grill a steak just to chuck it in the garbage without eating it.  Would God create all things in 6 days, rest on the 7th, and continue to rest forever more? I've done such things, though not on quite such a grand scale. I could name a dozen unfinished projects right now.  Is there a God? A Creator? There will never be an answer. A scientist, by proving through experimentation that there is no God, will probably at the same time prove himself to be God. Also disproving the omniscience of God.  And yet, after all this rambling, I'm no closer to knowing who I am, what I believe, or where I am going.

						   So I managed to finish another term paper. I came in a smidge shy of the 5-8 page mark... but the topic  was  quite dry. I could have written a dozen or so pages of encyclopedia derived facts and figures but that's not what the professor was looking for. She wanted analysis and thought... So I analyzed and thought my way through 6 pages, including title... and the last page was half bibliography. Oh well... I think I could still pull an A in the class. Final is coming next week... can'tcomplain much about open book open notes... it's just that there are 3 books and no notes... why didn't anybody send me notes? hmmm....

						   Wow... two school related posts in a row. I feel like a real student or something. Not that I've set foot in a classroom or anything like that, but that's the only it's going to get done.  I've spent a big chunk of today trying to write my term paper (due in 3 days... love to procrastinate) for my arts literature and music class. It's regarding the Baroque architecture of Christopher Wren and Francesco Borromini. Hey, wake up... you've only read the topic.. you're not the one sitting here trying to find something interesting to write about it. I just finished a quiz for the same class... Got them all right... that was a relief... After taking the quiz I decided to look over the term paper requirements one more time (just for kicks I guess...) and what I had originally remembered saying 10-12 pages in length was only 5-8 pages. That makes my life a whole lot easier. I guess my other class this quarter that required a term paper had 10-12 pages... and I only wrote 6 or 7 for that... I'm not overly concerned though. I really only need a B in my classes... my company reimburses me 100% if I get an A or B... that's incentive enough.. I don't need to spend $3000 of my own money just for school. Of course, defining "my own money" is interesting enough... Originally that money was just $1200. Thank Montgomery for the G.I. Bill. I never thought I was going to use it.... Eh... boring writing here too. Not that it matters how boring this is... nobody is reading it. I'll probably come back to this at the end of the year and delete it... Maybe I'll write something more interesting some day.

It's on the TV right now and, frankly, I'd rather go to the nearest Karoke bar and listen to locals... even drunk locals sing songs they hardly know the words to.  Anyway. Something else that bothers me is fat people who used to be super-fat and dieted for a while and now think they're thin... even though they're still fat.  I'm done now.

This is an 11-year-old girl asking for more MODEST clothing. Something makes me think she wasn't looking for sex appeal in modest clothing; probably quite the opposite I'd imagine was on her mind. What business does a preteen girl have trying to be sexy anyway? None... that's Ella's point isn't it?

						   I took today off because my daughter's daycare was closed. It's Dawn's daughter's graduation from 5th grade. We never had graduation until high school. Fifth grade graduation seems over done.  Anyway, I've learned a very important lesson today. Soft Scrub is foamy. It may not seem foamy when used properly but when you put it in the dishwasher it foams up pretty good. There are a couple of rust stains on the inside of the dishwasher left behind by a cookie sheet and I was cleaning them up with soft scrub with bleach. When I finished I started the dishwasher up with a full load. Looked just like it does in the movies... Water and foam slowly creeping across the kitchen floor. Dripping into the basement below...  I'm stupid. Luckily I was able to suck all the foam out of the dishwasher with my shop vac.

						   A couple of nights ago I had another dream in which I can fly. I think I was out in front of our house but I don't remember anything else about the setting of the dream. It was different than other flying dreams I've had over the last few years though. Usually when I fly I control my altitude by taking deep breaths. The deeper I breath the higher I go. And every other time I've had dreams where I could fly I was always in a Superman-like position; head first, prone, perhaps an arm out front to lead the way. But this time I was in sort of a seated position which seems awkward to me. I controlled my position and movement more through leaning forward and backward, left and right. I felt like I didn't have quite as much control over my movement but my altitude was much easier to maintain. I wasn't flying for any particular purpose that I can remember. In the past I have flown from the doors of the building I work in to my car or some other location. I'm not sure I have it logged in here anywhere but a couple of years ago I had a flying dream where I left work and took to the air to find my car. I looked down in the parking lot and instead of seeing cars zipping out of the gates I saw many brightly colored llamas filing neatly out of the lots. They threaded their way neatly and courteously through the rows and aisles of the parking lots. No, I don't smoke, inject, or snort anything or pop any pills. This stuff is all natural. I'm just that strange. I had once written a poem about flying in my dreams but it got locked away in a zip file to which I forgot the password... along with several others I thought I'd never want anyone to see.  That brings on another thought though. Why wouldn't I want someone to see them. Really. I used to write stuff in high school all the time. I had two whole comp books full of them by the end of my senior year. I'm too stupid to save stuff like that though. The only thing remaining from my high school years is my letter jacket (the ugliest thing you could ever imagine) and my yearbooks. I don't wear the jacket because it's so ugly and my arms are about two inches longer now than they were in school. I don't look at the yearbooks because I don't really have a good reason to. I only had about two friends. The rest were girlfriends and girls I wanted to date but could either never get up the nerve to ask or just never had the right timing. All I ever did looking back at them was wonder why I dated the ones I did and why I never dated the ones I didn't.  The point is I used to write poems and share them with Kris. Any other day I could have told you her last name but for some reason I can't come up with it right now. Starts with a K or a hard C. Kurth. That's it. Kristina Kurth. Anyway, I used to show them to her and she was mildly amused. Most of them were goofy, but they all meant something to me. Should have saved them. Maybe then I could remember who I was then.  I know for sure though that I never had dreams in which I could fly. I like these dreams and I hope they keep coming back.

						   This is my fourth Father's Day since our daughter, Lauren, was born. Today has been the best so far. Lauren woke me up this morning around 8 or so, bursting into the room yelling "Happy Father's Day, Daddy!" Then she told me she drew some hearts for me and had a card. "Daddy, you have to come down and see your card, now!" It was one of those pop-up cards like a kids book where the animals move when you turn the pages. It was a bear giving me a hug.  We're also in the middle of a move right now so there are boxes all over the place. Angie didn't have a chance to get some wrapping paper for my gifts so early this morning she decided she'd put my presents in a box and decorate the box. She drew hearts and flowers and Lauren colored them in. Lauren also drew a picture of me and her holding hands. Best wrapping paper ever.  Best Father's Day presents ever, too. I've been wanting an electric shaver again for the last couple of years but I just haven't felt like spending the money on it. Last time I bought one I didn't really like the way it worked. That may have been a birthday present actually. It was a Norelco with the Nivea goop dispenser. Just made for a messy shave... and it didn't shave close enough without the goop. I don't like the rotary systems. My first shaver ever was a Braun back in 1994. I think it was a gift my mom bought for me before my senior year in high school since I needed to start shaving almost every day. That thing came in handy during basic training the next summer! So they got me the Braun shaver that has that cleans itself with some alcohol based cleaner. I shaved with it this morning already. Yup, I like it. Actually, I hadn't shaven since Thursday night with hopes that I was getting this shaver today. I hinted that I would like to get it and it worked.  I've also been wanting to get some nice beer mugs too. You know the kind. Big heavy glass mugs with a handle big enough to lift with a full fist. The kind you don't store in the cupboard but in the freezer. I'm not sure why I haven't ever just gone out and bought these but I just never did. So she got them for me for Father's Day and they're perfect! They're being washed now and I will be trying them out this afternoon.  Best Father's Day Ever... and it's not even 10 am yet. We're off to Bob Evans for breakfast...

						   I love getting the mail. I never get anything worthwhile but, still, for some reason the adventure of opening up that box to see what's inside is exciting.  Today was a great mail day. I opened up the box and found three envelopes of nearly equal size and a&nbsp;oversized circular with ads from various local retailers. I found out I can have carpet installed tomorrow and a sunroom added on by next Saturday! Why do they send these ads to people in apartments? To taunt us, that's why.  On to the envelopes. I typically sort my mail in order of least credible to most credible and then from most relevant to least relevant.  So usually the bills are the most credible and most relevant. Not my choice but society seems to think that's the way it should be. Anything mortgage related that's not from my mortgage company goes to the bottom of the heap and is generally ignored all together.  Today's heap&nbsp;started with a confirmation notice from the post office. We recently moved and put a forward order in so we continue to receive the rest of the heap. Next was an envelope that wasn't marked indicating its business in my mailbox. I opened it and found it may have belonged at the bottom of the heap. It turns out that if I scratched the five boxes on the card inside that I could win a 13 inch TV, a DVD player, or $750 in cash! Would you believe my luck that I scratched and won $750? Me either. But if you check your mailbox you probably did too. I read the fine print just enough to confirm it was bogus. I think it was some sort of time share sales gimmick. I remember seeing something about 90 minute sales seminar. Must have been time share.  The last envelope, and the most disappointing, was from  urlLink The American Poets Society . Several weeks ago I came across their web site while doing a search for something else. While there I submitted a silly free verse  urlLink poem  I wrote shortly after I bought my first laptop. In the envelope was a letter saying they wanted to publish my poem in their next anthology which is due to go to press in the next six weeks. I was pretty excited. So I read a little more. It sounded legitimate but it seemed like they wanted me to buy a copy of the anthology while confirming&nbsp; the text was correct and that I was indeed the author. The more I thought about it the more I questioned how real it was.  I did some searching on Google and found a couple of pages that made me decide to just toss the thing in the shredder.  What a disappointment to think for one moment that I was being published and the next to discover it was all a scam! Of course, I can't complain much... I didn't lose any money in the deal.   urlLink http://www.complaints.com/directory/2004/june/9/14.htm    urlLink http://www.complaints.com/directory/2004/june/4/24.htm    urlLink http://www.eliteskills.com/writing_scams/victimview/55

						   Today is officially our fourteenth day in the apartment. It's going alright. The a/c doesn't blow (or rather, blows) in Lauren's room which is probably attributable to a giant hair ball in the ductwork. The woman that lived there before us was incredibly hairy. She may be the missing link. She lived there for four years and never bothered to pour draino down the sinks. Took a double shot to make them drain right. It's a little smaller than we're used to and it's on the third floor, but we're managing. My neighbors subscribe to the Baltimore Sun. Or at least the Sun thinks they do. There were 14 newspapers piled up in front of their door today. There's also a flyer from the apartment management on the door. That's from July 2nd. I don't think anyone is dead in there. The usual apartment smell lurks in the stairway but nothing hinting of a human body decaying. Maybe they've been dead for so long that the stink has gone away or just blended in with the rest of the strange smells one finds in an apartment building. Maybe the guy fell into the refrigerator and couldn't get the door open. Fourteen newspapers. If the resident is on vacation do you think he's really going to come back and read all of his newspapers that are piling up in the hallway with their little orange and yellow bags? I've been contemplating taking last Sunday's paper since Sunday. I want the circulars. I'm a circular junky; have been since I was a kid. Even if I'm not shopping for something I can easily sit back with the Sunday paper and read circulars from Radio Shack, Best Buy, CompUSA, Circuit City, and Sears. I always find something I like in one of those. Anything with electronics, tools, gadgets, or men's clothing I'll read. This morning as I stumbled my way down to the parking lot I noticed today's paper wasn't in the pile with the rest. It must have slid off the top of the heap because it was laying on the first step on the way down to ground level. I could see the picture of the front page through the plastic. It's Michael Phelps, the Maryland swimmer who's going to Athens. Now, this paper is just going to go to waste anyway. Either one of the other neighbors is going to get tired of stepping over the pile and throw them all away or the owner is going to come back and do the same because who wants to read two weeks worth of papers in one sitting. So the paper becomes mine. I really only want it for the funnies and the crossword puzzle. Maybe I should have liberated Monday's paper instead. The Monday crossword I can always finish.

						   Well, I shouldn't be sleepy smurf today... went back to sleep at 3:25 or so and woke up at 6:30. Realized I forgot to put my jeans in the drier last night so I'm waiting for them to finish now. It was such a wimpy storm though... it had started raining pretty hard a little while before the strike and I remember we both woke up... Angie looked over at me and asked if windows were open on anything... nope... and then a few minutes or something later KA-BOOM!!!! I think the flash and boom were so big it interrupted time or something. We both sprung up from the bed without bending at the waist! I ran to the window to make sure nothing blew up or was on fire and Ang went and grabbed Lauren. The next step would usually be head to the basement and check the weather from there but as we're in a 3rd floor apartment....  But since I was looking out the window I realized there was virtually no wind and no other lightning... a stray bolt I guess... but it was friggin huge. I wonder what it hit. Haven't been outside to look around yet. Every damn alarm in the parking lot was chirping, beeping, wailing, whatever... It looked like a carnival with all the lights. I sure could use a funnel cake about now.

						   Yup... that's me.  Here we were getting finished with dinner and getting Lauren ready for her shower and bed time routine and the weather radio alert starts to sound. I walked over to the desk where the radio sits and start listening to the alert... "Sever Thunderstorm Watch for Anne Arundel County..." "Gee, hon, looks like we're in for some rain and storms." So I go on with the shower. As we're finishing up the alert sounds again. "Severe Thunderstorm Warning ... places in the path of this storm are ... BWI ... Fort Meade ... Odenton ... " OK... we're right in the path of this thing. So I did my usual; I opened up the weather channel site and the NOAA site so I can look at the radar data to see how close it was and how bad it will really be. Yup... we're going to get creamed. It was a huge line of red returns on the radar stretching from York, PA all the way down to what looked like Quantico, VA. Everybody's getting creamed. About that time I start to hear the thunder. I love thunderstorms. My dad and I used to watch them roll across Tampa Bay when I lived in Florida. It was always a great show. So I always like to watch the storms roll in. I opened up the sliding glass door and screen and walked out onto the balcony. A nice wall cloud just passed over head. The storm was coming from behind us so I'd have to make do with watching it slip away to the southeast. The rain had just begun to sprinkle a little when I walked out on the balcony but it very quickly turned into a massive downpour with about 40 mile per hour winds. It was a great storm. I could feel alternating puffs of warm and cool air make their way onto the balcony. What an event of nature. I'm loving this! As the rate of rainfall reached its apex I glanced down at the cars in the parking lot. The Jeep is getting cleaned again. Good. I was a little tired of seeing the same mud on the sides. CRAP! I don't remember opening the sunroof today! *DASH DASH DASH DASH* It's only about 20 feet from the entrance to our building to where the Jeep is parked today. I'm drenched. Ang asks if it was wet inside like somehow the torrential downpour avoided the Jeep somehow. I turned to show her my rear end, soaked from where I sat on the drivers seat while closing the roof. The cup holders are now swimming pools for mosquito larvae and the center console CD holder is filled deep enough to hold Jaws himself.  I am King Moron. This is the second time I've done this in 3 weeks.
