      Well this is my new blog since I took down herzblut. I may go back once I get a new hard drive. It's just a matter of time for me to wait to get one. I'll buy one, maybe later! As of now I have no real use! I just need an old hard drive or something. I can see if there is a spare 2 gb hard drive anywhere. However no more hosting, since I'm gonna start using OpenBSD....  Well more later...

      Warping away into nothingness Watching the rose go through it's time Waiting for my rose to find it's roots  Life is but a rose So beautiful, yet so hard to grasp It has many faces all mine are dreadful  It is not my time When will it be my time? Waiting for the rose to change Waiting for the beauty to show  All I see is the thorns pierce through me the touch of pain as it destroys me slowly.  As revelations come and go lifes true eyes show. Life is not yours to have

      Man everyone now a days are depressed. It's like a friggin trend. It doesn't do shit, it just makes you feel worst. But depression has it's benefits I guess.  1. When I'm depressed I think a lot. This is a mixed blessing, as it may lead to good thoughts or just thoughts on why I shouldn't kill myself. It's just like that. When I'm depressed I seclude myself. Doesn't matter what anyone else says, only thing that matters is what I'm thinking. 2. It brings you close to people. No one likes being alone, unless you totally antisocial and wanted everyone dead, but that's a different story. You find people to be there that you thought didn't care.  3. It makes you observe your view of everything. For example, I came to the conclusion that there is no God, for if there was a God that only wanted good, then he would have not created me. Therefore, God is not an option for me, but you do become more spiritual and see more to this lifetime then afterlife. This may differ you may be closer to God, but for me it was further. 4. It made me more compassionate toward animals. Sure not all of them are great, but no one/thing's life should be taken from them/it. Everything has a natural right to live, and it is only up to them to make a decision if they want to kill themselves or not. No i'm not a vegetarian, but when you do eat meat, don't waste it, after all an animal did give it's life to feed you. Enough of my antiwasting ramp. 5. Some of the best works come out during depression, so write a lot. You'll get some good stuff out. Or I did in my case. Just write a lot and edit it later. 6. This is not really something you get out of depression but something to help it. Especially if your depressed about a girl, just watch a comedy, like American Pie. (Just rerun the Shannon Elizabeth sequence a couple times :p) Just watch a lot of comedies, it'll help you out of it. Or it did for me anyways. 7. Pain does seem real at this point, more real then anything else, but don't kill yourself. Life the first Noble Truth of Buddhism, Life is Suffering. It's ok to punch walls and do damage to yourself, that's nonlethal, if your totally depressed and find none of my information useful, either get help, or go ahead and kill yourself (Your choice there) 8. There is no #8  Well just some shit I've noticed when I was out of it. Hopefully someone will make use of it. And Connie, this is me, not you so it may differ. :p

      Girls are so hard to understand, man it's like we males need to like act like ones to find out how they act. For girls, its easy for them to be like males, since males make everything. LOL! not trying to be sexist but it's true. Girls need to tell us males what they like and stuff, we can't figure it out. It's like hell trying to know a girl, another hell trying to figure out what she likes, and a third hell just to talk about the stuff they like.  :-/ Man life has so much I don't understand and never will.

      Man I just remembered something I wanted to post. Friday when Amanda and me went out to eat we got stuck in the theater parking space, or she did anyways. Come on now anyone could have gotten stuck, how can anyone park in that angle?  Anyways, after many tries to get out and sitting there for a few minutes, we got out using mad geometry skillz. :p Maybe I shouldn't have laughed, but it was just so cute to see her that way, I couldn't help it. :(  Anyways, we parked up higher. Damn I should of taken pictures, and oh yea... not even a scratch. :p  Man I feel bad, might be why she wasn't talking to me. *sigh* This stuff is so complex, why can't I simply be a rock. Rocks have such a better time don't have to worry about shit... or maybe they do...but other wise they don't have much to worry about...  Well i'm becoming an addict and net gone morrow, gonna cry :(

      Hmm...well I thought I type some random stuff into my blog so here it is. Lets talk about Shrek 2, I loved it! So what if it's a kids movie, it was great. Man the whole Ponicco wearing thongs part, that was great. Laughed my ass off! And Puss in Boots, he's so cute,  man I feel like a lil girl right now 8-), but it was funny.  It was a great sequel better then the Matrix sequels that made no sense. Just a lot of fucked up shit. But I recomend everyone to see this movie, so what you waiting for...go see it, now! I order you! :)

      Well five more days till I go to India, man I'm gonna be bored there. This will likely be my last post as my dad's gonna cancel my net morrow. Good riddence, Comcast is beginning to get on my nerves not letting me have multiple computers on my network. The bastards! Any yes I did try everything, even changed my router, to no avail.  I went to a "party" last night with parents, man I was bored as fuck, all the dad's looked the friggin same, come on can't you come up with a new fashion trend? But my dad was not part of that so I'm happy, were always out of the norm.  My cuz's dad was like we all need to move to India, hell no! I'm not moving there now, after all that I've accomplished. Screw that! Life's a bore!   Well this post is out of the norm as well since I usually write when I'm fucking depressed! I should eat and do my portfolio.....ummm....shit!  Anyways will write later and add more pictures, fuck yea! Man I fucking curse a fucking lot. :p It just lets out the fucking pressure. LOL

      Life is really starting to get to me, it's fucking hell. Every small thing doesn't make sense. How can i conseive of reality, everything looks so true, so real, except there is something missing.  There is something missing from me. Something trying to get in, something I always seem to block.  My mom is constantly pissed off at me, and most people are as they have someone to turn to, and I have no one.  I am alone in my mind, friends will be there but it doesn;t matter, i'm alone in my mind, alone in the darkness, alone with the anger, alone with the impulse that drives me ever closer to self-destruction.  Pain doesn't seem to matter anymore to me. It;s something more real then anything else. I can count on pain to be there, when I can't count on others.  I no longer or ever care that I go to college or die before I go, death is more real to me, simply stop exisiting. There is no place to go just cease to be.  I have no raison d'etre and it will be that way for the rest of my life. I see people all around me enjoying being, while the only thing I see of myself, is craving to end this enjoyment. I want to bring evil to the world, want to make everyone suffer the way I am suffering.  FUCK YOU ALL! FUCK YOU ALL TO FUCKING HELL, FUCKING ASSHOLES!

      Sorry about the last post not being complete. I was in Hong Kong when I wrote it as I was in transit to Singapore.  Anyways I'm in singapore right now and they have better keyboards at their free internet terminals then did Hong kong.  Anyways, like I was saying man there are a shit load of indians here it;s friggin annoying. They're everywhere! It's not even one or two, more like 10-20! I hate my race, damn bastards. Anyways I'm at a free net terminal in terminal 1. LOL! like that makes a difference. Anyways the plane ride was not as crampt as i thought it would. It was ok i guess.  I need to buy some sunglasses by the time i leave. Need em for the heat in india.  It's so nice to have net even for few minutes. I tried to connect to the wifi here but found out it was for pay. GAY!  Anyways I'm standing here writing this. I haven't gotten into a fight with parents yet and they are letting me go on my own tours. Man i guess i'm grown in their eyes. Anyawys, i got pictures and i'll try to upload them as soon as possible. I've been doing nothing more then shooting pics. Some are nice others are crappy oh well. Sinapore airport is nice has many of these unusual osaises, will put pics later.  I'm already missing my friends right now. They seems so far away! Sucks! But I gotta get gifts for them all.  Well that's all for now, i'll come and write more as stuff comes to my head. i got a long wait ahead so might as well. more later

That plane ride was figgin long and with so many indians, man it was like all of india was on teh god damn plane.  Anyways, we are currently in Hong Kong waiting as our plane gets ready to go to Singapore in like an hour.

I'll try to edit these as much as possible as I want to put them into one, and maybe have like a small manifesto of some sort.  Anyways a list of somethings to do over at India and after I get back: Take lots of pictures Meditate a lot Gain weight Try to go to gym Practice driving Climb up to tariputi English AP Hw Biology AP Hw Develop my website Start writing prompts for Berkeley Sleep a lot Read a lot I'm running out of stuff to do....add stuff later lol.

      I'm already missing everyone, it's starting to hurt. It's like i'm all alone again. This bites! I feel like a whole part of my life is missing, gone from view, it's over. I know I'll see most of my junior friends again next year, but it's just that the end is so near, it's like everyone is gonna go their seperate ways and I'll be there alone in a whole world. It is what is scaring the shit out of me!  It's just being alone!  And next year, everyone will be so busy, different classes and shit, not being able to do a lot of things. Man it's killing me! Fuck, and I don't want to go to India now, last 2 summers were so fulfilling meeting so many new people, it was great.  Basically I hate saying goodbye. I don't like saying it, and it is just that it is so final! I didn't even feel like then when I left El Dorado behind. It's just I want to accomplish so much and it feels so far and distant now. I'm just going to miss everyone!   All of a sudden I feel so alone....I hate ends...

Ah well, friends are friends for life.  Noor, Cecilia, Stephanie, Thuyet, Jason, Fabian, and me went to see Shrek 2 and went out to eat at I love Teriyaki, forgot the damn pictures, and hella took out the camera too. I'm a fucking idiot! It was fun though. The waitress asked where Amanda was, lol, we do go there often though. Laughed seeing Shrek again, Ponicco rocks :p "I'm a real boy!" And Puss in Boots, man that was so cute, almost wanted to buy a cat.  Took my Physics and Math finals today, I have a feeling I did not do so well. There is no point in me going to class morrow. Nothing to do there!  Man I'm gonna miss everyone! :( And well this means I'm a senior now, lol, or almost.  Well all I want to write for now. Maybe more later.

      Well I did it I stayed up for about 28 hours, not bad. Next time when I don't have finals to worry about I'm gonna try to stay awake for 2 days, possibly during Relay For Life.  Man stupid ass finals. I made hella stupid mistakes in physics, which is gay, and finally , I did ok in math. Stupid parabola's and shitz.  Seems Amanda's mom gave her a scare last night, just as my dad gave me a scare, opened the door real fast to my room and made me have an adreniline rush, I was more awake then shit. Damn parents, don't understand, we kids don't do stuff in advance. :p She also stayed awake the entire night, but for work purposes. I on the otherhand being a freak of nature stayed up, doing nothing, not even really studying. But got some good pics though, guess the night was good for something.  Well times a ticking, running out, just a few more days and I'm out of here. God save me, I don't want to go. :( Want to have a free summer, ah well, I guess I'll take a lot of pictures and meditate a lot.  Well I gotta take a dump :p well not really, just wanted to end this post funny. LOL! I'm a freak!

      Well I got my net back and I promised myself I'd be online sparingly. This means no more being on for hours on end. I'm gonna set myself a limit. And since i found out how to manipulate myself so i can change I am gonna do this.  Anways, SBC Yahoo is a bitch for multiple computers. Can't have internet hosting anymore. What a bitch! But I'm gonna install OpenBSD on my box to store my code and private stuff. you know just for safe keeps as a server. Was thinking about FreeBSD 4.10, but then thought it'd be better if I used a secure OS just for the hell of having a secure system.

What not! Got a bunch of pics, yay! And i guess that's pretty much it. But I had fun and got to miss school, a big plus! &nbsp; Anyways, i'll post the pics as soon as i'm back in the country and have a decent net connection. i better be off now, as this net is getting slower by the second and people are wanting of a net connection. i'll writer asap. Ohh... I can writer without looking at the keyboard or the screen. :p This is fun! Anyayws better be off.

       Another kick ass song :) Ill Nino - Cleansing  From guilt to dust You think that I don't want to hate you I know that I never did like you This is not another passing phrase But I can see your face But when shit will finally break me Persistent in trying to get me El fuego que quema adentro Gets to my head  Stay away I never want to see your face Forget my name There's nothing you can do or say Stay away I never want to see your face Forget my name There's nothing you can do or say  You think that you're so much like me But you will not ever remind me Of everything that I cannot embrace But I can see your face I'm trying not to remember I'm trying not to point the finger El fuego que quemo adentro Gets to my head  Stay away I never want to see your face Forget my name There's nothing you can do or say Stay away I never want to see your face Forget my name There's nothing you can do or say  I think I kind of hate you I never really liked you I think I kind of hate you I never really liked you This is not a passing phrase I think I kind of hate you I never really liked you I think I kind of hate you I never really liked you This is not a passing phrase  Stay away I never want to see your face Forget my name There's nothing you can do or say Stay away I never want to see your face Forget my name There's nothing you can do or say

      Ok I read in this book if you want to improve something you have to set goals and keep thinking of them and your mind will formulate for you that which you desire.  So here are my long term and short term goals, enjoy being bored :-)  Long Term: Gain Weight, work out, straight A's in school, SAT I & II prep. Build vocabulary Practice Guitar everyday  Short Term: Learn Calculus, German, Finish Summer HW by Aug 18, Gain weight  Well i'm a boring guy, leave me the f alone ;) And here are the lyrics to Ill Nino - This Time's For Real. Kick ass song :)    Why do you tell me all these lies?  I just want to live my life  I don't want to leave my dreams behind  Tell me  Why am I only getting older?  My patience getting shorter  I'm running out of time  And I hope that I get what I wanted   This time's for real  Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?   This time's for real  Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?   Why do you make me feel denied?  Always pushing me aside  You do not decide what's wrong or right  Tell me  Why am I feeling so much pressure?  Am I searching for the answer?  I'm running out of time  And I hope that I get what I wanted   This time's for real  Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?   This time's for real  Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?   This time's for real  Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?   This time's for real  Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?   Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?

      Ill Nino -This Time's For Real kick ass song. :)  Well I talked to Andrew today, friggin didn't regonize his voice. Fuck I guess he's friggin different and I'm still the same old shitty me. I so need to start truely gaining weight and going to the gym or something. Damn! ;-  Well I keep doing push ups and sit ups at random times through out the day. And specifically before I sleep. For example, last night I did 55 push ups and 105 sit ups before sleep. Not much of an accomplishment for others but it's a damn big acheivement for me. :) After all i'm just a fat person who has flabby arms, ok maybe not fat :-) but i'm so friggin out of shape i'd probaly pass out if I ran 10 yards. :-)  Well gonna meet Andrew on Sat or Sun. For the rest of the week my goal is to gain at least 2 pounds and to keep doing push ups and sit ups, along with meditation. :) Shit my mind is so full of thoughts if I close my eyes all I see is an endless film running in my mind without a stop. Try concentrating on your breath when that's going through your mind. It makes you want pop corn. Haha!  Mmm.....popcorn.....

      Today started out bad, but it has gotten better. Day started at around 8 when I set the alarm to. When I didn't get up my mom nagged at me until I finally gave in and got up at around 9:30.  I started getting ready and left with the gifts at around 10:55. When I got there Jason, Douglas and Mark were already there. Finally a few minutes after me Alex showed up. And a short while after Sam, Connie and Mylien. A few minutes after that Lauren showed up.  We went to eat. And after that Lauren and Sam left, as well as Jason and Doug. The rest of us went to see a Harold & Kumar go to white castle. It was a good movie funny yet stupid. It's a comedy why would one expect. After that we went to Fry's and did a couple of circles there. For an hour or so. After that we went to Petco. Then Half Priced Books. I was bored out of my mind and so took my leave then.  Then in my military fashion I left to home.  It's odd how aware one is when their back is straight. It's almost like I was a spy looking around. When I got home I played my guitar for a few minutes around 20 :p and then went to the bank to deposit some money and do the laundry.  Then I came here. Sat around for a few minutes and then picked up the laundry and then came here to write this.  Love is hard to do, I have to completely change myself. This life of me is just too mundane and crappy. Need to do something new and unusual. Just out of the ordinary.  Crossed legged doesn;t hurt no more. Just feels wierd.

      I feel this is going to be one long ass post so bare with me....  There is something inside me that is thriving wanting to get out, something. A feeling! It has to be something good a new energy it's making me more useful.  I saw the Bourne Supremacy and Bourne Identity on video. Good movies now I have to read the books. These are the books I want to read in the following order: Bourne Identity Bourne Supremacy Bourne Ultimatum Crying of Lot 49 (Because of the reference Justin Frankel used for WASTE)  There are many things I need to do starting this month. 1. Start my weight gain plan. 2. Start working out 3. Start work on summer hw 4. Start work on SAT 5. Start work on crypto program 6. Start work on some research papers 7. Start work on learning effective communication (i.e. Talking clear) 8. Start learning French again from the beginning, need to be fluent 9. Start work on learning German 10. Start learning Calculus and other high end math. (Why? Well because) 11. Start working on reading a lot 12. Stop going on computer for more then 3 hours (even that is too much) 13. Start meditation again 14. Start learning about business, investing and etc. (Why? Need to make $$$) 15. Start being more effective at what I do 16. Start being more focused and concentrated 17. Start learning matial arts (Akido, Kung Fu, etc.) 18. Start learning cryptography 19. Start writing a lot 20. Start learning guitar and bass once I get it  This is all in no particular order.  In the future I would like to learn these languages fluently. Some may be ones I know somewhat:  French (fluency) German Spanish Russian Telugu Hindi Japanese Chinese (Mandarin)  Why do I want to do this stuff? Because if 96% of my mind is unused then I think that is a lot of unused potential needing to be exploited. Therefore I want to learn the damn things. And plus it'll help me if I ever travel to Europe which I hope to do.
