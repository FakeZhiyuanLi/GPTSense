      I've been reading  urlLink Operation Terra  Book 2. I finished Book 1 about 3 weeks ago. They aren't long books, just a lot to absorb. I placed the link to the website for this book because I want other people's opinions (not that anyone will read this but if they do...) because I have mixed feelings about it.   A lot of what the book says resonates with me but some of it I'm afraid to believe. There will always be a skeptic side of me no matter how much I'm into metaphysical stuff.    According to the book our current reality is going through the process of splitting. The book separates the human population into two groups, Service to Others (STO) and Service to Self (STS). This makes quite a bit of sense to me. I see it all the time. The book also says that the change is starting to accelerate and we might notice extremes of both polarities (positive and negative). The united States is a prime example of that. I consider the Gay Marriage movement to be a very positive thing (more on this in another post) but it has created some very negative response. San Jose just voted to give the same rights to gay city workers who have been married in San Francisco as straight married couples.  Now there is a small group that wants to recall everyone who supported this. Our president wants to amend the constitution to ban gay marriage. We have large groups of people getting more and more into spirituality and choosing peace, but it seems there are just as many people who are choosing the opposite path.   The thing I like most about this book is that it says to respond to the chaos around us by finding comfort within. Don't identify with all of this chaos because soon (relatively) we will be separated from it. Apparently we will be increasing our vibration, but it seems to me they have hinted that we might have to leave our bodies. I don't how this will work. There's a lot they talk about that is quite outside my realm of experience.   Anyway, please check out some of the messages on the website for Operation Terra and tell me what you think!

      To avenge the recent prisoner abuse, al-Qaida associates  urlLink beheaded  an American. This has suddenly turned my husband against the Iraqis after being somewhat supportive of them in his feelings against this war. He says "Fuck the Iraqis, I don't want them beheading a fellow American who was over there just trying to help rebuild." I don't know what to think. In a way I can't blame them for wanting to retaliate when they're already pissed off at us to begin with and couldn't care less which American they killed. But at the same time, I keep thinking, don't you want peace? Don't you want to get your life back to normal? I have no idea what the US is going to do about this. I have no idea what they should do. The government has made such a mess over there that they really can't leave without doing something to fix it but the Iraqis want us out of there pronto. Will any other countries help them out? Will they ever have peace? What's going to happen in the next 20 years? Does it even matter? Half of me is concerned but the other half says, "This isn't really effecting me, so who cares?" I hate being Gemini sometimes. It makes it really easy to see both sides but impossible to know which is the right one. Maybe its because there is no right side.

      So many people want to be God's voice, telling others how God feels about them. "God hates fags! God hates abortion! God hates you!" Then there are those so called christians who say things like "I will pray you get hit by a train." How can these people call themselves christian? I would  so  like to talk to one of these idiots and ask them how they can call themselves christian when they pray for harm or death to come upon a person? How can people call themselves pro-life if they believe in war? How can anyone say they know what God thinks or feels?   If God really didn't want us to do those things that are considered evil, we wouldn't be able to. God would never have given us free will. We would be living just as the other animals do. But there's a reason we don't. And I don't think it's so God can test us to see if we really love Him/Her. To me it makes more sense that God created us all (in His/Her image) so that God can experience physical reality in all of its various forms through us. God created good and evil so that we can choose which one we want to experience. I can't even call it evil. I agree with the Operation Terra books that our population is split by those who are inclined towards STS and those inclined toward STO.

      I'm going to start trying for a kid fairly soon, but in order to do that I have to give up pot for a little while. The problem is I really like pot   and I don't want to give it up forever. It's so hard to convince myself when is a good time though. I had said to myslef that I would quit on July 6th. When that day came I convinced myself that I should wait until the end of this cycle. But is that a good idea? Will I convince myself of another reason to not quit? Why is it so damn hard?

      It's friday already?! Thank God! Well, after going to the doctor's office tuesday, I had to get blood drawn wednesday to get    all    the tests done. When I told my husband about it and included that I'll be getting a cholesterol test, he had the gall to tell me that I'm no youngster anymore. Gee, thanks for rubbing it in, honey! You're really one to talk. But alas, he does go to his appointments and gets his blood tests done regularly.  I recently got back in touch with my friend,  urlLink Stacee ,  whom I went to boarding school with in 9th grade. She told me that when my husband and I decide to start trying for a kid, she'll make us a sling. She's such a sweetheart.

      Well, it seems CommentThis! has decided to go on the fritz. So screw them, I'm not using them anymore. Unfortunately my comments got deleted! :o(   Anyway...Why is it so hard to remember temping in the morning? I put the thermometer right next to my head next to the bed. I even put up a neon sign that says "Remember to Temp" but did I remember this morning? Noooo. I ended up temping an hour after I got up. But I was being really lazy this morning and hadn't moved in that hour, so maybe I was still ok.   I have a doctor's appointment today. It's my first time seeing this doctor. She's a substitute for the one I had signed up for originally. Apparently the other doc is only taking new HIV patients. Does it count if my husband has it? I almost asked, but...I didn't. I don't know why. I'm still kinda curious.  I'll have enough questions for the doc when I get there. I've been saving up symptoms to talk about. Let's see, there's my psoriasis, ADD, anxiety/depression, IBS, baby-making, mold health risks, ummm, that's all I can think of. I'll make sure the doctor earns her paycheck today *smirk*.

      I've decided to finally join the ranks of women using blogs to stay sane in the quest for baby-making.  Even though my husband and I haven't officially started trying yet, we've already had to deal with some infertility issues. The fact is my husband is technically infertile because he has HIV. We live in the state of California and it is against the law in this state to impregnate a woman using sperm from a man who has tested positive for HIV.  So, they're telling me I can't have my husband's child. I can either travel to a different state or country, spending way too much money on traveling expenses as well as the cost for a sperm cleaning, IVF procedure, testing the embryo, then testing myself, or we can go with a sperm donor, saving thousands of dollars. Hmmm, what do you think? Hubby and I have decided that we'll go with the donor. Now, we have to decide where we'll get the donor sperm, if we want it to be from someone we know or not, will we do it at home or at the doctor's office, blah blah blah. So, for now, I'm just practicing temping and procrastinating a bit. Besides, we need a car.

      The donor responded today and he has turned me down. He was quite nice about it. However, I wasn't prepared for how I sad I would feel. I guess it's because this made the possibility so real. It would be one less expense. But it wasn't meant to be. I really do not look forward to the selection process when it comes time. I have a hard enough time buying shoes because I can't decide. How the hell am I going to choose one sperm donor over another? None of them are my husband. He definitely doesn't want to use a known donor. Even though I haven't even started to ttc, I sure do know how much it hurts to have fertility doors slammed in your face. I often wish I didn't want to become a mother so badly. I wish it didn't hurt so much when I am forced to consider the possibility that this may take a long time. Knowing ahead of time really doesn't do a damn thing to make it any better.

      I just sent a questionnaire to a man who is offering to donate sperm for free. I was skeptical at first, I mean why would someone want to accept   all   of the costs (shipping and everything). I looked over this guy's  urlLink website  and he seems to have been very thorough. He has given a lot of information about himself. It would be such a Godsend to be able to get the sperm free of cost.  It also helps that the donor posted pictures of himself as a baby and kid. He doesn't look a lot like my husband, but he kind of looks like a mix between us. Besides, he has the important characteristics. I am really excited but nervous to hear back from this guy. His questionnaire was pretty detailed. I almost felt like I was applying for college again. I did like the fact that he is willing to be an open donor and meet with the kid once their 18 if they so desire. But he otherwise wants no contact and that's how I'd prefer it. He has provided sperm to several other women, so there is a small concern of half-siblings inbreeding without knowing it, but the donor suggests being open about the origins of the child so when the time comes, they can be sure their future partner isn't of the same genes. He is keeping confidential files of whom he has donated to (I guess) so this info can be found later if necessary.  I am so jealous of all the women who are in the process of ttc right now. I sooo want to start! Even my husband is baby dreaming now. He gets a goofy smile on his face when he sees a kid do something cute. My tummy is full of butterflies at the thought of having a baby!   Now, I'm not so sure I want a car after all. Gas prices are soaring right now in California, and San Francisco (my home town) has the highest in the state! It's amazing that Californians have to pay more for gas when we're closer to the refineries than the people of Utah or Colorado.  I'd like to look into getting a gas/electric hybrid car, but I'd need a good loan and payment plan. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that having filed bankruptcy last year. Thank God we're back on track financially. It helps that hubby and I both have jobs we like. I'm hoping that since I work in such a small office when I do have a baby, I'll be able to bring it with me. I plan to breast feed for at least a year. I have plenty of motivation: I want bigger boobs without surgery! ;o) Not that that's my primary reason, but it's sure a nice side-benefit.

      I have made a huge discovery. God's name is Murphy. You know all that talk about Murphy's Law? Well, apparently, that's the way the world really works, so God's name must be Murphy. Think about it: When you want your period to show up, it doesn't. When you don't want it to, it does.  You're not ready for kids, you get pregnant. You're dying to have kids, you have fertility problems. You get a dog so it can play with all the other dogs at the local park, your dog hates other dogs. I'm seeing a pattern here. But seriously, why does it have to be so difficult to conceive for the women who want children most?   *sigh* Life hasn't been easy for my blog buddies.  It seems like they get kicked in the teeth at every turn and there's not a damn thing any one of us can do about it. Fuck!

      I got my blood work results back on Wednesday. Everything's great. No anemia, high good cholesterol, low bad cholesterol, still HIV-, have never been exposed to either type of hepatitis. So I got a clean bill of health. Now I need to go to the gynecologist to double check everything is doing well in that neighborhood. I was a bit relieved but not all that worried to begin with. My husband was especially relieved. Whenever I get tested he has trouble sleeping the few nights before. I asked him if he'd rather I not tell him before I get the test done and he told me he'd prefer to know about the test before hand. So, what can you do?  Yesterday I spent some time looking at sperm donors at a few different banks and wrote down my favorites' donor numbers. When I get the chance (probably this weekend) I want to show my husband the donors short profiles offered free on the websites. One thing that has me a bit uneasy is that I heard on a donor insem. board that it can cost up to $1000 a cycle for this. I can't afford that much. I was thinking $500 per cycle max. There is an antiviral gel called  urlLink Pre-fix Invisible Condom   that says it is effective against HIV as well as herpes which it advertises its use for. Many people caution against using this gel because it can't guarantee 100% protection from HIV. But condoms can't either. It says the effectiveness is over 99.9% but they legally can't say 100% effective against HIV. This would be the complete answer to our prayers. My husband isn't completely comfortable using the gel, though. I have given him all the information I have about costs, etc. so now he just needs to think seriously about it. I have no idea what he'll decide but I'm at the point where I'm ok with any decision. I just want to have a baby. If he's ok with a donor and would prefer that than I'm ok with it too. I have to admit that I'd be ecstatic if he decided to go with the gel.   I have researched the ingredients they talk about on the website and they really have been proven effective in real scientific studies. Here's an excerpt from the FAQ section of Freedom Antiviral's website :   What ingredients are in Pre-Fix? We have carefully researched every available substance that is being tested for anti-viral lubricants to prevent STD transmission.  It turns out that the most powerful of these are naturally occurring in certain plants.  Our proprietary formulation includes  active antimicrobial ingredients refined from 17 natural sources, in a water based gel.  Our formulation also includes several substances that prevent skin irritation.  This is very important as irritation of the epithelium lining of the vagina plays a key role in STD transmission.  Substances that are highly anti-microbial can loose their effectiveness or even promote STD transmission if they irritate the skin.  This has proven to be the case with the antimicrobial Nonoxyl 9 - it irritates the skin and so does not lessen STD transmission.  For this reason our formulations include no substances that irritate the skin of the penis or vaginal lining - specifically we do not use Sodium Lauryl Sulphate or SLS.   Our key ingredients have been clinically proven, in human trials, to lessen or prevent STD transmission.  They key here is human trials, as humans have much more vigorous and potentially more skin damaging sex than do animals.  Some of the active ingredients include:  sulphated polysacharides clinically proven to prevent STD transmission when formulated in an sexual lubricant  saponins clinically proven to prevent STD transmission when formulated in an sexual lubricant  cellulose acetate phtlalate clinically proven to prevent STD transmission when formulated in an sexual lubricant  thermoreversible gel clinically proven to prevent STD transmission when formulated in an sexual lubricant  Bioflavanoids clinically proven antiviral to STDs  Polyphenols clinically proven antiviral to STDs  Apigenin clinically proven antiviral to STDs  Quercetin clinically proven antiviral to STDs  Terpene oxides clinically proven antiviral to STDs  Polysacharides clinically proven antiviral to STDs  Immune boosters clinically proven to boost immunity to STDs  Several natural skin anti-irritants to prevent irritation to the vaginal lining  How does Freedom Lubricant work? The active ingredients in Fix-It prevent virus transmission in several ways.  Some directly kill viruses, some envelop them to prevent it from replicating, some attach to receptors on the virus to prevent it from replicating, and some stimulate an immune response in the body to destroy the virus.     Other products under development rely on just one mode of preventing virus transmission. Some of the more successful antimicrobial lubricants being researched use sulphated polysacharides or cellulose acetate phtlalate to encapsulate viruses and so prevent the viruses from having any effect.  We have incorporated all of the best currently available technologies into one product, thus preventing transmission in several ways at once.  We have been very careful to avoid any antimicrobial substance that has the potential to irritant the skin in the vaginal lining.   Fix-It also contains ingredients to reduce skin irritation, and promote a natural antiviral response from the body.   It sounds like it's got real promise. I'm not really scared. Maybe I should be but I have very strong faith (not blind faith, mind you) that everything's going to turn out alright. Some way or another.

      Well, I thought I had gotten through all 3 of my "shit happens in threes" thing. But I guess my lunch flying all over my shoes and pants doesn't count as a separate incident. I was afraid of this. As it turns out, when I got home I managed to break our light switch so we can't turn on the light in the living room. Great, huh? That sure put me in a good mood. Not.

      Man, what a fucked up morning I had! First, I woke up at about 4 am cramping for seemingly no reason. I got up and peed to relieve some of the tension, put on my heating pad and went back to sleep. When I got up at the regular time (6-ish) and went to the bathroom again I found I was blood-soaked even though I was fresh when I went to bed the night before. So that's what all the cramping was about. My uterus was having a blood party. I managed to forget about that until I'm almost to work and feel something dripping on my leg. But it's cold, not warm. I look down and my entire lunch (which happened to be soup) was no longer in the tupperware container but in the plastic grocery bag soaking my breakfast. When I looked at the container to see if the lid wasn't closed all the way, the wind blew the bag just right so the soup blew out of the bag and onto my pants and shoes. Then I saw that the lid to my lunch was useless. It had a nice little hole in the top. I wish so badly that I could hold my composure in situations like this, but I couldn't help it. I started crying. I mean, of ALL days, this has to happen on day 2 of my period and a Monday. It felt like a truly Garfield-worthy Monday. Well, those things tend to happen to me in three's so at least I got it all out of the way in the morning. The rest of the day has been pretty uneventful for which I'm glad. I'm ready to go home though. I'm tired.

      I had the brilliant idea of having Duncan Holly Biomedical Inc. wash DH's sperm and then send it back to us so we can do the IUI ourselves using the Freedom Antiviral Invisible condom as back up. Then I read the fine print that says they will only ship the washed sperm to participating IVF clinics because The Center for Disease Control does not believe it has proven safe enough. What would prove safe enough is beyond me. Here's an excerpt from thebody.com about sperm washing:     "Italian doctors have successfully performed nearly 2000 IUIs without any reported  urlLink seroconversions . Although this technique is widely used in Europe, especially Italy and Spain, the CDC does not recommend IUI of women with washed sperm from men infected with HIV. This position followed a single case report of HIV transmission to a woman who underwent IUI from her HIV-positive husband in 1990. This led the American Society of Reproductive Medicine to advise against the provision of assisted reproductive technology services to HIV-infected individuals. To date, this is the only documented case of HIV seroconversion following insemination and is presumed to be a result of inadequate washing. In Europe, washed IUI is usually tested for HIV using PCR technology, but this is not routinely done in the United States. This further step essentially eliminates the possibility of HIV transmission to the woman."     So, I am very frustrated and angry that instead of implementing a relatively simple procedure to make sure sperm washing is safe for IUI, they just ban it all together. WHY??????!!!!!!!!  It breaks my heart. My husband is more OK with using a donor than I am. Not that I'm not OK with it, but I would much rather use his sperm than anyone else's. But then what if sperm turns out to be useless anyway? What if his sperm is completely immotile? Then we will have wasted all that time energy and money. Women whose husbands have azoospermia don't have any choice at all, so I guess I can't complain all that much. Wait. Yes I can! This is my blog! Ha!   Anyhoo... In July DH and I are going to a big family reunion of his in Indiana. DH said he has a cousin that looks remarkably like him and maybe he'd be willing to be a donor. Who knows though because they haven't talked for years.   "Hey there cuz, nice to see you again. By the way, feel like donating some sperm?"  Yeah. Kinda weird. But if he and his cousin are OK with it, then so am I (unless cuz is butt ugly or something).  It would save us a lot of money though. Probably a few hundred per cycle. I don't even dare get hopeful though. I've found that whenever I get excited about something and I'm really looking forward to it I end up getting disappointed. I once read this and loved it immediately: "It's better to be a pessimist because you either get what you expect or you're pleasantly surprised."

      After hearing about this  urlLink college student  on the news I wanted to kill that bitch.  The anger that I felt was almost surprising. How could she be so fucking stupid???!!! Anyone who has taken a sex ed class in California (she's from San Francisco) knows that if you have a baby you don't want or can't keep, you can bring it to the fucking hospital without getting in trouble! You don't have to give them your name or any other kind of information. How dare she kill that baby?! I have absolutely no sympathy for that girl. Even my husband was pissed. He was saying we could have taken care of that baby. I still can't stop thinking about it (obviously). I just don't understand. There is too much information and support available to do something so selfish and stupid and just plain fucking wrong!  OK, I think I got that out of my system.

      I went to Texas for a week to help take care of my sister's mom (SM) after major back surgery. While I was there we had a discussion about having kids. She feels DH and I are no where near ready to have kids any time soon. I was very hurt and angry by that at the time because she has no idea what my day to day life is like. After I calmed down and thought it over, I could see where she's coming from but I still disagree with her on many issues. One is whether I should go off my meds before getting pregnant and for how long. I have done research that shows there are no known occurrences of birth defects or damage caused by prozac or wellbutrin which are what I'm on. If I do decide to go off meds I don't think I should need to wait a whole year before getting pregnant. She said that was to have a 0% chance of having birth defects and I told her there was never 0% chance. Then she got mad and said "I meant from medication!" To me what difference does it make? I can't understand stopping taking chemicals that are helpful when chemicals in foods continue to be ignored. Plus, she's against smoking pot (even just a little) when she, as an former coke addict, now takes Adderall (which only has mixed amphetamine salts as it's ingredient), celexa (an anti-depressant), and Ambien (sleeping pills) on a regular basis. Um, thank you very much but I'm gonna stick with pot. I'm not going to smoke it while pregnant and for that I absolutely will go through a cleansing period to get it out of my system.   But as we were talking, she brought up the idea of adoption. I'm not against adoption by any means. Hell, I was adopted! But I'm just so afraid that the combination of DH's age, our age difference, his HIV, and his criminal background will make it close to impossible to adopt. I would have better luck adopting on my own. But I'm not going to divorce my husband. Duh. Although SM sure seemed to be trying to convince me that that's what I should do. Just because she can't keep a marriage doesn't mean I have to get divorced too. Ok, I know that was rude. I was just sooo frustrated when we were talking. I came home thinking a lot about adoption and maybe we shouldn't be bringing more children into this world when there are so many that already need homes. But the thing that kills me is that they make these poor little things wait so long to be matched with parents sometimes. If we end up finding an agency that will help us, I'd like to try to adopt a kid rather than a baby. The babies always find homes and I'm almost 25 so I have a bit of time on the biological clock for getting pregnant. I was thinking it'd be great to adopt a kid between 3 and 10 (I'd like to get them before the reach middle school).  I'm intimidated by the adoption process. If we do adopt, we probably have to move first where that wouldn't be necessary right away if we got pregnant. There are a lot of other costs to factor in. Oy. This is a scary journey sometimes. But it means so much to me.

      I've decided to switch back to CommentThis because I like their smileys better and their over-all presentation. Plus it seems like they've got their shit back together. When I get paid I'll go ahead and send a donation to help the guy keep this service running. You can't expect people to do all of this for free all of the time and still pay their bills. I love free stuff and will always try to find it, but I also believe that if you can offord to pay something (even just a little) you should. When you can afford it of course :o) I've saved the comments that were on HaloScan and will eventually paste them into CommentThis comments.

      I went to San Diego the other weekend and visited my family and my best friend (BF). I got to see my niece for the first time. She's 8 weeks old, well now 8 1/2. She's so adorable. The only thing that kind of bugged me was that my brother and SIL wouldn't let me hold the baby because I have a cold sore. I had washed my hands before going over there and offered to wash my hands again plus assured them I wouldn't kiss the baby. But they still weren't comfortable with it. It made me sad. I didn't have a fever or cough or runny nose and the sore was mostly healed, just a scab left. I figured my brother would understand since he gets them too, but I guess one should never under estimate a new father. Perhaps this is a little bitter of me but when my SIL was emphatically insisting I'll be a good mother some day (she and my brother do know our situation) I couldn't help but think "But not good enough to hold your baby." It just makes me kind of sad that I don't live closer and therefore can't spend much time with them. My niece is going to grow up knowing my little sister better than me. I hope that's not always the case.   When I spent time with BF she kept telling me she couldn't wait until I became pregnant so she can be "Crazy Auntie". She's a nurse and I told her that the only people besides hospital staff I want in the room are her and my husband. I figured she would be able to watch out for me with a professional eye. She was honored that I asked. :o) I am also looking forward to having kids, but I wonder when we will actually be able to start trying, realistically. I really want to get a car first, but with today's gas prices being so high and on the rise, I keep wondering if it's worth it. There are lots of mothers in this city that get by fine without a car. *Sigh* I wish I knew what the best thing to do is.

      Well, as cool as it is that Blogger has their own comment system now, it's frustrating that I can't get my old comments back up. I don't know if I'll be able to or not so if you don't see your previous comments on here I'm sorry, I tried...

      I have a dear friend I met through an e-mail group. She lives about 2.5 hours north of me. After years of mental and physical abuse this woman's husband has filed for divorce at the promptings of his daughter. He has told my friend (JA) that if she gets a lawyer he will make her life hell. She had tried to get a lawyer anyway because she needs the alimony as she is disabled and has no job right now. She has not been able to find a shelter to take her in because she has no children and she is on medication which they will not distribute to her and will not allow her to keep it to take it herself. So she has been forced to stay at the house where her soon to be ex can come and go as he pleases. A week from last Friday he returned home and raped her. He tied her ankles and wrists to the bed posts spread-eagle. He used nail clippers on her genitals and when she was screaming too loud he switched to a razor blade. She spent that weekend in the hospital and has been trying to find out if she can leave town before the court date. I'm trying to get her to come down here to San Francisco where she'll be far enough away from that bastard and safe. She'll be able to start her life over. The police have told her they can't protect her from this man, so what is she supposed to do? I know this post isn't very coherent, but it makes me so incredibly mad that there are such sickos out there. JA has been beaten down so much that she can barely fight back anymore. All she has to eat is peanut butter and crackers. Ugh, I hope she'll be able to come down this weekend or next week. The sooner the better.

      I found a sperm bank that's located right here in The City. That will make such a huge difference in cost. Shipping charges alone would have cost around $100 more or less. Plus this bank will release the sperm directly to us instead of requiring that a physician do the insemination. I have already found the perfect donor there and it's not even a highly requested donor. We're supposed to choose a few more in case our first choice in unavailable but I have found that the characteristics I'm looking for differ from the average. Most women are looking for medium-sized men with fairly athletic if not slim builds. I'm looking for a man with a large build because my husband is a big guy. He's 5'11" and weighs 220 - all muscle. My own birthfather is 6' 5" and weighs over 300 lbs. - mostly muscle (but a nice big belly). I think it would seem kind of funny if we ended up having a shrimp of a boy. Now a girl can go either way. I'm 5'4 and around 120 lbs and my birthmother is 4'10" and pretty petite as well. I seem to have gotten my birthmom's upper body and birthdad's lower body. Tiny shoulders and boobs (barely an A cup) and nice big birthing hips as my grandma liked to say. My (adoptive)parents liked to tease me about being pear shaped when I was in high school. So, these hips better pay off and make child bearing easy or I'll be pissed.  Just kidding. I just better be able to get pregnant at all. Or else I'll really be pissed.

      I was hoping we'd be able to start ttc this year. But it looks like that's not going to happen. With all that has been going on this year... My good friend's wedding is this Saturday and she would have put a hurtin' on me if I got pregnant before then since she paid for our bridesmaid dresses. You gotta love her for that (paying for the dresses I mean).  Then we have to pay $700+ for our trip to Indiana for DH's family reunion. Then we get a 2 month break before we go to my dad's wedding in October. The dress my dad's fiancee picked out is beautiful too. It's strapless but has enough elastic to stay on even with me not having any boobs to hold it up. But anyway, I could try to squeeze in ttc but I really don't want to. I want to be able to go out with my best friend and have a couple of drinks with her, maybe go dancing or something. Smoke a couple of forbidden cigarettes. I need to get this stuff out of my system once and for all before I really start ttc. DH thinks we can sign up with the sperm bank at the beginning of next year. It will cost $150 to set up our account with the bank. If we decide to use an Identity Release donor, it will cost $210 for a standard ICI vial and $245 for a prepared IUI vial. If we use an anonymous donor it will cost $185 for ICI and $215 for IUI. If we want to use their photo matching service, that will cost $45. I really don't know how important the photo matching service is. I guess that's one of the things I'll have to talk to them about when we do sign up. I found a donor that in my opinion is quite ideal. But the problem is the ethnic background of this donor is German and Irish. My husband really doesn't know if he has those ethnicities in his ancestry but he does know he is part Serbian and part Italian so he wants me to look for people with those ethnic backgrounds. My problem is that the ones I have found like that usually have the wrong height, weight, hair texture (it HAS to be straight as both mine and DH's is very straight)or bloodtype. I learned that (especially if you're an O blood type) if the baby you're carrying has a different blood type than yours you'll more likely miscarry because your baby's blood is attacking your blood. That's why you can't get blood transfusions from the wrong type. I'd be willing to bet that IF doctors most of the time don't even think to consider blood type as a factor. If you have AB blood it would matter so much because you can take blood from any type. A types and B types are not as much at risk but still are. Weird, huh? But I digress...I wish this could be a spontaneous surprise. Or at least I wish this could be as easy as it was for my Bro and SIL. You know, have a few tumbles in the hay, complain about being tired all the time and end up with a healthy baby at the end of 9 months. My brother complained about having to deal with his MIL for 3 weeks after the baby was born. I thought to myself "Count your blessings big brother, you'd be glad for it if you'd been trying for years rather than um, no effort at all. Oh hell, I sound so bitter. I'm really not though. Jealous, though, very much so. But why should I be? They were much more ready for kids. They certainly have the money for it. My brother writes computer programs for the Navy. They got a letter from good ole President Georgey congratulating them on their baby. Not that DH and I don't have the money because we do. And we pay more in rent than Bro and SIL do. I'm just tired of waiting! I want to be able to hop in the sack and come out a month later saying I'm pregnant. Surprise! But no. I'm not going to tell my family when we're officially trying though. It would drive me crazy if they kept asking me "Any luck yet?"

       urlLink    On June 12th two of my close friends got married. I like to say I was responsible for hooking them up but it really took a bit of a group effort. However, I was the one who officially introduced them and the one who exchanged their phone numbers for them. So I'm gonna take the credit ;o)  One of the funnest parts of the day, though, was when two other close friends of ours got engaged at the reception! That's them in the picture. Instead of tossing the boquet over her head, the bride turned around and threw it directly at our friend. That's when our friend's boyfirend was given the microphone by the DJ and he proceded to share with everyone the myth of a woman being a bride's maid 3 times before getting engaged. The story goes that the woman will then be destined to be an "old maid".  So to prevent that from happeneing, he proposed to her. It was sooo cute. Up until then I had managed to keep my eyes pretty dry, but I lost it then. It was so hard to keep the plan a secret from her. People kept bumbling and saying revealing things to her but luckily she never caught on. Just this past weekend she asked me if I'd be her Maid of Honor. Of course I said yes. I told her, "I'm, well, honored!" :oD     I wonder if I'll be pregnant at her wedding. DH and I have talked about it and decided that we really don't need a car right away. The city is small enough (7 square miles) that we can walk, take public transit, a taxi, or an ambulance as the case may be. I'll have strollers and baby slings so that won't be a problem. I'm so ready to start ttc. I've got a serious case of baby fever. I really can't wait much longer. In fact, July 6th will be the start of my cleansing period to get all the toxins out of my system. Every time I look at the clinic's registration form I get all goose-bumpy. Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby... OK I'll stop now.   &nbsp; urlLink

      Early tomorrow morning we leave for Indiana and my husband's family reunion. He hasn't seen any of them in about 15 years. So needless to say, I haven't met any of them yet. He does, however, talk to his dad and e-mail his sister on a regular basis. I've also spoken to various family members on the phone. They felt they had to meet me somehow before we got married. :o)  I don't feel especially excited about this trip, which is a good thing because whenever I do something always seems to go wrong. And I can't seem to help it when I'm excited about a trip. But then I always end up forgetting to bring something, or I leave something behind. It's quite annoying. I am looking forward to this trip, though, don't get me wrong. But it's not exactly the same thing as spending a weekend with your friends from college. It will help for me to be the calm one because my husband hates flying to begin with. He is claustrophobic and gets anxiety attacks. He doesn't drink, so that's not an option on the plane, and he doesn't want to get valium from his doctor, so I think I'll bring my lavender oil. It really seems to help him. It's typically used in aromatherapy as a relaxant and pain reliever. I personally think it works mostly as a placebo, but hey, if it works I'll use it.    I'll have my child-hood stuffed dog with me like I always do when I travel. His name is Chris Dog. My favorite aunt gave him to me when I was 6 or 7. :o) My older sister also got one that year but didn't play with it like I played with mine. She still has it though and when I saw it a few years ago, I was amazed at the difference. I thought "So that's what he looked like when I first got him." My closest friend in Northern California, we'll call her KK, also has a teddy bear she's had since she was a baby. Her uncle gave it to her and kept one just like it at his house. He's dying of emphysema and lung cancer so when she went down to see him after her engagement he gave her the twin teddy bear. The difference between her bear and it's twin are unbelievable. She's had that bear a lot longer than I've had my dog though. That's one of the things we bonded over when we met in college. Our stuffed animals and our love for funky nail polish colors. :op   KK will be taking care of our live dog, Bren, for us while we're in Indiana. In fact here's a picture of Bren:  urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink    Isn't she precious?

      Today is my 2 year wedding anniversary. It's weird because on one hand it feels like the time has flown by. On the other hand, it feels like it's been longer than 2 years. But then that's because it kind of has been longer than that. As of my birthday I had been living with my hubby for 5 years and we started dating 5 1/2 years ago. I remember when I first fell in love with him. I decided that I didn't care if our relationship worked out or not, I just wanted to have his baby. I knew he would make a good dad and I could just tell that our genes would go well together. That was the hardest thing for me to get over when we found out about DH's HIV. I knew it would take a really long time for us to be able to afford an IVF procedure that would allow us to use his sperm, and frankly we didn't (and still don't) have the luxury of waiting 5 or 10 years. It still makes me sad once in awhile, even though I have processed the emotions to their fullest extent. If I have one child by sperm donor, I don't think I'll want to have another using my husband's sperm even if we could afford it because I'm afraid that my husband might favor that child over the first child. Plus, I have absolutely no full-blood siblings. I have 2 half-sisters and cousins who I was raised with as siblings though. I think it would be nice for my kids to be full-blood siblings. My point here?  None what so ever.

      Most Fridays are. This one most certainly isn't. Today I was laid off from work. &nbsp;I was told that they need someone with more experience and who can get more work done.&nbsp; I'm not going to make excuses for myself. I'm defintiely not the world's best employee. But I gotta say, I didn't see this coming.&nbsp; Man I feel like such a fucking loser. The last job I had I was fired after only 2 months because I couldn't work fast enough. This job I was only at for 7 months.&nbsp; The job before that I had for almost 2.5 years but quit because I was being asked to take on more responsibility than I had experience for and when I asked for help I was given none. Then I found out a few months after quitting that they were going to fire me anyway.&nbsp; Even though I don't have a perfect work ethic, I think I have a pretty good one.&nbsp; Thank GOD we are finally not in the red financially. Otherwise I'd be having a nervous breakdown.&nbsp; I think I have to come to terms with the fact that I'm good as a receptionist, but not at much else. I need to go back to school so I can learn how to do tech support, but until then... The lady who hired me at this last place really liked me, I could tell. She said if their new receptionist doesn't work out, she'd love to have me in that position. She also said she would talk to her friend who runs a temp/employment agency to see if she can help me out. I really appreciate it but it still hurts, ya know? My husband came over to my work when he got off so he could help me pack my shit up.&nbsp; So now, here I am unemployed again. Fuck I'm depressed.&nbsp; Seriously, why is it that everytime life seems to be getting back on track something happens to fuck it up?

       Well, Indiana was interesting. The night before we left, DH got a call from his sister, TW. TW was really upset because of a phone call she received from their cousin. This cousin had just heard that DH would be at the family reunion (which TW organized) and was very upset because her children would be there and she felt they would be at risk being in the vicinity of DH because of his HIV. TW was aghast at this but asked (to see what she'd say) what she thought TW should do. Cousin said that TW should disinvite DH!! TW then said "He's my brother for God's sake!!! You wouldn't do that to your own brother!" To which Cousin replied "Yes I would." So TW told her, "I always knew you'd sell out your family, I just didn't know what it would take." Anyway, there was more to the conversation but I can't remember it all. DH was trying to act like he wasn't upset, but I could tell he was. When we got to Indiana, we had a great time seeing TW, her kids and DH &amp; TW's dad, NR. TW didn't want to go to the reunion at all but had to drop off some food, plus NR wanted (and needed, really) to see his brother who is getting pretty old, so I went with them while DH stayed behind at the hotel because he didn't want to cause a scene. The bitch cousin wouldn't even talk to me when I got there, but I was introduced to everyone else. They all were nice and equally mad at Bitch Cousin. They kept asking where DH was and all his other cousins' kids were asking where he was. Many of them decided to go to our hotel later on to see DH. When we got back from the reunion I told DH what happened. He was visibly upset and started to cry a bit. It was so hard to handle. He didn't want to see his other family members because he lumped them all together. Luckily I managed to talk him into going out to see them after awhile. It took some doing though. I didn't want to see him hate his whole family for what one bitch did. Granted, it was frustrating that they didn't make a bigger deal out of it and publicly shame that cousin, but I guess that's not how things are done in Indiana. As soon as I get the address for this cousin I'm going to send her a lovely card.     In other news, my friend from boarding school,   urlLink  Stacee   , is pregnant with her 5th kid. I should be happy for her. I'm having a hard time with that. Damn it,  I  want to be pregnant. I guess some people are just meant to have a lot of babies. I've never wanted a lot of babies. I just want the process to not be so hard. I know, fruitless wishes. The thing is, though, is that I thought I had really come to grips with my situation and accepted it, but still, everytime I hear about a friend or family member getting pregnant the easy way I get a twinge of jealousy. And I'm so not a jealous person, either, so this is a weird feeling for me.   Maybe if I just print out all the paperwork and fill it out, the ball will start rolling, so to speak.

      I received a call from someone at  urlLink  Ciber, Inc.   for a full time receptionist position here in their San Francisco office. The had seen my listing on  urlLink  Monster.com   and called my cell phone # to ask me to send my resume. I got an e-mail back today asking me to meet with them at 10 am Monday. Before I even received the e-mail I called them back to follow-up. The same guy I spoke to said I'd probably be meeting with three different people. That's cool with me. I just hope I get the job. This would be perfect for me. I have plenty of receptionist experience. I like doing that. Plus, since this is a software and other computer technologies company I can learn more about the field I'd actually like to go in. Plus they said they reimburse for college tuition. We've also found a roomate to move in. A much nicer (and cleaner cut) guy than the last one. And he'll be paying 43% of the rent which will make a HUGE difference for us. We'll actually be able to realistically get a car. Which means DH is much more comfortable with starting to ttc.  Thank you, friends, for your comforting comments. Sometimes it's hard not to feel down in the dumps when things like that happen at first. But, me being a gemini, I actually thrive on change. So I really believe that this is a good thing. My life just might be taking a real direction instead of me just staring at the map trying to decide which way to go.

      You are so sweet Monique!! I can't even tell you how much it means to me to have the support of my Blog Buddies. You guys are so awesome. I'm sure many women in our blog circles will agree that without the support of you guys, We wouldn't be able to hold up to the shit that keeps being piled upon us. I don't know about anyone else, but I need you ladies to help me stay sane. Regardless of whether you're reading my blog or I'm reading yours. I feel so good when something good happens to one of you, as if it were happening to me personally. And when something bad happens, I hurt right along with you ladies to the point where I cry. Now, don't misunderstand me, I'm not a martyr in any way shape or form. In fact, they drive me crazy. I am, however, an Empath, and I can physically feel what most of you are going through. I can tell you that if I don't shield myself properly, the emotions I experience can be pretty fucked up. Nothing that's new to me, but sooo intense.... That's why I have to take meds. I was diagnosed with ADD (Attention deficit Disorder), not to be confused with ADHD which adds the hyperactive component to it. This happened right before my sophomore year of highschool. But widely, I always knew that there was more to no the the ADD. I was raised Catholic, but my grandparents were into the more mystical side of Catholicism. They would have prayer meetings every Saturday night where they would sing cool songs and the would speak in tongues as they hypnotized you into laying quietly on the ground as you where being filled with the "Holy Spirit". I don't exactly what they did but I was always a very spiritual child and I truly felt closer to God when they would have their prayer meetings. The funny things is I never understood Catholic Mass. One of the main things I remember is not being able to eat breakfast before Sunday Mass. I asked my grandma why ad she said that it was because we had to keep our mind on God, not food. But I couldn't help but think that I would have a much easier time thinking about God rather than food if my tummy were full.  But anyway........I think most women are empathic to a degree. But it is SUCH a weird experience when I feel someone's pain or joy with something I've never gone through before. It brings a whole new meaning to put yourself in someone else's shoes.

      Well, I got the job. It's pretty cool too. I'm still kinda feeling my way around and learning everything. The people here are really nice. I'm just trying to find out exactly what's exceptable to wear on Friday's because I've gotten conflicting answers. Supposedly I'll have it explained to me today once and for all by the Ultimate Authority, the VP. I think I'm supposed to not wear t-shirts or something but jeans are ok. So I;ll just have to go out ang get me some polo shirts or something. That way I have the best of both worlds. Comfy, yet nice enough to wear at the reception desk. AF is due any minute now. What a great way to start a new job, huh? But, it's better to get it over with now I suppose.  Our new roomate is really cool. I've invited him to join me and my friends a couple of times and we all had a good time. We went to a karaoke club and our roomate (RM) got pretty toasted along with my two other friends we were with. I was the designated driver this time so we wouldn't have to take a $60 cab ride. When I dropped RM off at our house he almost went up the wrong set of stairs. LOL oh that was fun. Then I continued to drive to KS and AK's apartment so I could get my own buzz. Luckily they had plenty of malibu in the fridge.  I think I finally went to bed at 6 am.  :oP
