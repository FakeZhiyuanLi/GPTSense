      Continuing from where I left off on my immigration theme ... here's my mom's story (lovedonnaz, you'll just have to wait :-) ...  In the mid 1700's my mother's (father's) ancestors emigrated from England to the United States, settling in Virginia, then moving to Illinois. There, they founded the " urlLink Gideon Blackburn College ." After bouncing around for about 100 years between Illinois (funnily enough, my parrothead hubby from Illinois went to school with a couple of Blackburns :-), Virginia and Kansas, my great grandfather married one of the daughters of the founder of the famous "Lilly" drug company. After seeing ads everywhere for a " urlLink free land grab " in Canada, in 1901 my great Grandfather emigrated (with the help of his wife's family) to Southern Alberta. Fishburne to be exact. This land is still held in the family and lies sheltered in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, very close to  urlLink Waterton National Park . (This is the homestead I spoke of in my last post.)  My grandfather (who was English Protestant) met and fell in love with an Irish Catholic girl from London, Ontario.  Eventually, to the chagrin of both their families, they married anyway.  Both families promptly disowned them.  When my mom was 3 years old, her mother died due to complications giving birth to my aunt.  Needless to say, the rest hits a bit too close to home to talk about here.  But suffice it to say, that I am extremely proud of my family and my heritage, and continue to be amazed at how many people don't know their heritage.  Shame on all of us for not sharing these things and letting history get lost in the dust of the past.  There are so many things we can learn from our ancestors, and I think one of them is carrying on a legacy.  Legacies are always something to be proud of and shouldn't be ignored.  If you are interested, you could check out  urlLink this link .  Maybe you will discover a link to your past that you never knew existed.  Happy hunting :-)  After saying all this, I find it almost eerie that I married a man from the same region of Illinois that my forebears lived in years ago.  And now, he is going through immigration himself.  How uncanny that history seems to repeat itself.  Coming soon ... the story of how a parrothead came to become a Canuck-ish hockey fan.  Stay tuned :-)

      In tribute to my friends and family in Alberta (new and old) and to give the FLAMES a boost tomorrow night, I post my tribute to my home province.  This song (called "Land of Dreams"), I wrote and recorded in Calgary in 1988.  Actually (to be honest), I wrote the lyric, and a gifted songwriter in Calgary (Dean Miles) wrote the music & supplied all the instrumental (plus the harmonies, along with myself).   The day I was inspired to write this song I was in Mountain View, Alberta, standing in the farmyard of my Great-Grandfather's original homestead.  It was a day in early summer, and when I looked to the west, I could see the foothills extending into the Canadian Rockies.  In the foreground, I could see a church, tiny, white and sun-drenched, framed by the light green of a ripe hay field.  And oh, the immense silence and power of it.  "Land of Dreams" is the song that was the product of that day and is dedicated to all of the weary travellers who have made this province their home, and any others who may join us in the years to come.  Not only is it appropriate for Calgarians, or even Albertans ... it's appropriate for any Canadian, or anyone who has seen the majestic beauty of the praires as they meet the Rocky Mountains.  Long live my home and long live the spirit that dwells there :-)  I love it and I always will ...  Before you click on the link to this song, please be patient.  It is a big file and may take a minute or two to load.   urlLink VegasBaby, copyright 1989.

      At work today the subject of immigration came up.  Everyone I work with (with the exception of myself and one other) are first generation Canadians.  These great people had intriguing and (in some cases), sad stories to tell.  It started me thinking about my own roots and my families' history in Canada.  Allow me to share with you my dad's families story.  (Let me interject here and say that I have always found it fascinating to learn peoples' history.  How they came to be where they are today, and the sacrifices and heartache that accompanied their choice to immigrate to another country.  Far, far away from their family, their birthplace, their home, and everything they love and draw comfort from.  So here's what I know about my dad's family ...)  My grandfather's family emigrated to Canada from Germany in the late 1800's.  My grandmother's family were of German stock that ended up settling in southern Russia.  They were very wealthy, had servants (or serfs) and lived in a grand house.  My grandmother's father's brother left for Canada in the early 1900's and settled a claim in northern Saskatchewan.  Over the next few years he did everything he could to entice his brother to follow in his footsteps.  Being that my grandmother's family were happy and comfortable farming their land, they always said no.  Then, at the close of World War I, there was extreme danger in the Russian homeland.  Millions of Russian peasants came home from war to drought and starvation, and took exception to the lucky few that weren't suffering.  So, at the  urlLink brink of civil war , my grandmother's family fled Russia on a boat bound for England, leaving behind all of their wealth and bringing only what they could carry.  Eventually, they ended up in northern Saskatchewan, until tragedy struck again.  This time in the form of a  urlLink worldwide plague , in which my grandmother's mother was taken, leaving my grandmother (who was 9 at the time) with no other choice but to quit school and care for her four younger siblings.  A year or so later, my grandmother's father decided to take a trip to  urlLink Mexico , bringing his young children along.  While there, tragedy struck once again.  Somehow (through illness or accident), my Great-Grandfather died, leaving his young family (the youngest being 4 years old) all alone and stranded, thousands of miles from anyone who knew or cared what happened to them.  My grandmother, being the eldest, took charge.  She took the only option open to them at the time ... they hopped freight trains.  From Mexico to Northern Saskatchewan.  On their own.  Amazing.  It was in Mexico that my grandmother met my grandfather, so all things being equal, I guess it was fate.  But still ...  Can any of us even begin to understand what that must have been like?  I don't think so.  But even up to the moment that my grandmother passed away, the most singular event in her life, above and beyond all of the other hardships she suffered, was the loss of her mother at such a young age.  Here's to all immigrants ... past, present and future.  Let them be welcomed into their new home.  And let them know suffering no more.

      I have a confession to make.  Hubby and I have recently started playing online poker.  At  urlLink The Gaming Club .  We started playing for free, but recently started playing on the "money" tables.  In tournaments.  Our best finish is 4th place (out of over 1,000), our worst was much lower.  Now I KNOW I heard a few *gasps* of horror out there, but before anybody starts panicking, let me explain.  Our poker interest was piqued one Sunday night at midnight.  We were about to shut the t.v. off and go to bed when   urlLink The World Poker Tour   happened to come on the channel we were watching.  Hosted by Vince Van Patten, Mike Sexton and Shana Hiatt ... and I thought to myself, "Self?  How unwholesome could this game be?  With Vince Van Patten at the helm?"  And with the first hand of  No Limit Texas Hold 'Em  poker, we were mesmerized.  For those of you unfamiliar with this particular game of poker, it's  urlLink pretty simple .  Two players post a "blind" bet, after which every player is dealt 2 cards face down.  There is a round of betting.  Then (those that haven't folded) see three more cards dealt face up.  These cards are called the "Flop" and all players use them to build on what they've got in their hand (called the "Hole" cards).  There is another round of betting, at the end of which the remaining players view the next card, called the "Turn."  There is more betting, followed by one last card being added to the community cards, which is called the "River," at which point there is a round of final betting.  Finally the player with the best combination of "Hole" and "Board" (the table) cards, wins the pot.  As I said, we have graduated to money tournaments ... approximately 8 so far.  Our first tournament we came in 7th out of approximately 700 players.  We won 107USD.  Our fourth-last tournament we came in 4th place out of over 1,000 players and won 180USD.  And finally, our second last tournament we placed in the top 100 out of 8,000 players and won 88USD.  In all we have staked 17USD of our own money, the rest of the time we have been winning or playing off our winnings.  And we're having a blast.  If I've piqued anybody else's interest out there, we'll maybe meet you one night across the green felt ;-)  If not, that's okay too.  In the meantime, tonight the "World Series of Poker" is on t.v., and if hubby and I can find the broadcast, we'll be watching.   Kewl Poker Terms:   American Airlines  -- A pair of Aces.  Big Slick  -- A King and an Ace.  Broomcorn's Uncle  -- Someone who keeps anteing up until he goes broke.  Draw Dead  -- Trying to make a hand that, even if successful, will not win the pot (e.g. drawing to make a flush when your opponent has a full house).  Gut Shot  -- To draw an inside straight.  Limper  -- The first to call a bet.  Maniac  -- An overly aggressive player, who usually ends up losing. But beware those who just pretend to be maniacs: their wild play is a ploy to confuse.  Railbird  -- A non-playing spectator who enjoys watching the action.  Sitting on the Button  -- Having the dealer's position where you bet last.  The Flop  -- First three common cards in games such as Texas hold 'em.  Walking Sticks  -- A pair of sevens.

        Flames still have a ways to go ... but started out in an awesome fashion in the first of this 7-game series.  The difference in the game was a few things ... Calgary had a longer rest between series ... which arguably, could have been a detriment.  Tonight it didn't seem to be.  Other, more obvious factors, were Calgary's ferocious forechecking, their refusal to give up their own zone, the Lightning's obstinate insistence on trying to make the "pretty pass" (even though time and again Calgary stole the puck and, at least once, was able to capitalize) compounded by the fact that Tampa SEEMED to overlook the Flames and what it took to get them this far.  The next game will be tougher and I'm sure that Tampa won't make the same mistake of overlooking the Flames twice.  The new (yet-to-be-determined) factor, will be if Calgary continues to rise above it all and play with the heart that has gotten them this far.   GO FLAMES GO!!!!

      So yesterday being a civic holiday in Canada (thanks to Queen Victoria), hubby and I decided to be REALLY lazy.  We spent the ENTIRE day in bed … reading.  No really.  Both of us were reading books written by  urlLink Diana Gabaldon .  I was re-reading the third in the series listed below, and hubby was reading “The Fiery Cross.”  Even though these books are “Stephen-King-thick,” they are (like King’s work), incredibly worth the time you will need to invest to read them.  They are full of history (concentrated initially around Culloden), humor, pathos, and characters that draw you right in.  Here are the books (in order):  Outlander Dragonfly in Amber Voyager Drums of Autumn The Fiery Cross  I discovered Outlander one rainy Sunday afternoon in 1991 while visiting my parents, when, in utter boredom I sauntered off to the local corner store in the hope of finding SOMETHING to read.  Being that I was going to be doing my shopping at a 7-Eleven on a Sunday afternoon, and also due to the fact that the 7-Eleven was the ONLY place in this small Canadian prairie town of 6,000 that a book could even be purchased, I wasn’t expecting much.  Maybe a dime store detective novel or western at best, but fully expecting that all I would find would be a road map of the local area.  Instead, to my absolute surprise, I stumbled across “Outlander.”  A new novel by a (then unknown) author that would find me sitting down to read and absolutely forgetting where, or who, or even WHEN I was.  For several hours.  So for any of you out there that love to read, and for all of you out there that love to read historical fiction, and most especially those of you that are transported by excellence in writing, I highly recommend  urlLink these books .  And …    GO FLAMES GO!!!

      Something I have long been passionate about is animal cruelty.  I don't agree with PETA and never will.  I also eat meat, so I'm a bit of a hypocrite.  I admit it.  However, when it comes to animals that humans have gone out of their way to domesticate and enlist trust, it horrifies me to the point of tears when I hear about some crap-for-brains asshole beating on a trusting, domesticated animal for laughs.  Or for sport.  Or just because they can.  Or because they're sick and twisted.  I don't know, it just makes me cry.  It turns my stomach, and I truly believe that ANYONE capable of this kind of act needs to be watched.  Dealt with severely.  And I'm telling you right now, that if I happened across some happy asshole beating on ANY animal, I would "get medieval on their ass."  (Disregarding the fact that I couldn't fight my way out of a wet paper bag, it would be ON baby!)  And ESPECIALLY if ANYONE chose to hurt either of our cats.  I would (and I had to think about this a long time, but ultimately), I would die for them.  Seriously.  If it came down to it, I would.   Anyway, I read a story yesterday in the local paper that brought it home to me (once again) and has occupied my mind ever since.  The funny thing is, the second I read this story I flashed back to a couple months ago when hubby and I went to see "Bubba Ho Tep" at the University of Victoria movie theatre.  As we were leaving we saw a whole "herd" of rabbits grazing.  I was all "Aww, look at the sweet little bunnies."  Hubby said, "I would be concerned that some idiot might decide to hurt them."  I was horrified at the thought, and hoped and prayed that the unthinkable would never happen.  So when I read  urlLink this   I was in tears.  Literally.  This was a domesticated rabbit that was "left" on the campus grounds.  That was easily caught, held, and beat to death.  I will say here and truly believe, that even children nowadays have a voice to call for help.  There are 1-800 numbers out the a** for these children (thankfully), but animals have not, nor will ever, have a "voice."  All they can do is pray that they will not become victim to that kind of violence.  They are forever and always at the mercy of humans.  It breaks my heart to say, but this incident is a small one in the whole scheme of things in this world of ours.  We have all heard the stories and seen the pictures.  You know what I'm saying, and you've heard about it too.   urlLink Go here   This has become a flashpoint concern for the experts that have come to believe that behaviours like this are a sure sign of psychopaths or worse.  And I truly believe that crimes like these need to be taken a HELL of a lot more seriously than they are today.  Inroads have been made, and I don't dispute that, but the maximum sentence for the psycho mentioned here is a $2,000.00 fine and six months in jail.  I would prefer that this a**hole's sentence was something like this ...  Let's let him go home and get comfy watching t.v. one night.  At home.  Where he feels safe.  And secure.  And then let's have two dudes sneak into his apartment, have one of them hold him down, and have the other one beat the crap out of him.  Until he's unconscious.  Because even THAT will be better than the sentence he gave that poor, defenceless animal.  THAT would be true justice.

       To my buddy  urlLink Ted , thanks for the awesomely gentlemanly display of sportsmanship and true friendship.  You rock bud!  Thanks for the fun :-)  I only wish that tonight's game might have been the Stanley Cup Final.  Because both the Flames AND the Sharks deserved it.  Both lovedonnaz and I hope that you will join us in cheering for the Flames over whoever they play ... because we all know that Calgary has come the longest way of either Philadelphia or Tampa Bay.  That said ... YAY!!!!  I have been told by many people in my lifetime that I take hockey (and the Calgary Flames) waaaaaay too seriously.  I can't help my heart and I can't help my passion.  And the best part of this win tonight, is that Calgary didn't just do it for Calgary ... they did it for all Canadians.  Not only has it been 10 years since a Canadian team has been to the final (and let's face it, hockey is to Canadians as baseball is to Americans), but it's been 15 years since Calgary played in the Cup finals.  As I've said before, Canadians live and breathe hockey from the day they're born.  This Stanley Cup thing is a matter of national pride.  Besides which, who else knows how to make ice like WE do?  That's why Salt Lake City asked Canadians to pour both their hockey AND curling ice for them.  Maybe the ice tonight was the difference?  Who knows?  Or maybe it was the IMMENSE heart that Calgary played with.  Or maybe the Saddledome guys in charge of the ice, buried a loonie at centre ice?  Who knows?  LOL.  But no-one can argue that Calgary's played their hearts out so far.  The Sharks played very hard, but the difference in tonight's game (no argument) was Kiprusoff.  All hockey fans know that if you combine a hard-working team, an unfathomable amount of heart, speedy forwards, conscientious defensemen and an unSTOPpable goal-tender ... you have the ingredients for a Stanley Cup Champion.  I am happy tonight and wish that hubby and I could be "Rockin' on Electric Avenue" in Calgary with the rest of the "C" of Red.  As it is, we'll just have to celebrate here in our own way.  Flames ... you've had my heart since you moved from Atlanta ... you own it today.  :-)  To all my friends that read my posts, I promise (once the playoffs are over, of course) that I will write about something besides the Calgary Flames and hockey.  After all, the CFL is starting soon, right?  (Go Calgary Stampeders ... ROFL!)  But for now, you'll all just have to bear with me.  And now, all I have to say is ...   GOOOOO FLAMES GOOOOOOO!

         Flames captain celebrates after scoring short-handed goal.   Game 5 in the "Shark Tank" was everything Calgary Flames fans wanted and more, winning the game 3-0.  The most amazing thing was that not only did they score that all-important first goal (which of course ended up being the winning goal), but it was scored on a San Jose power play.  Man!  I mean, the Flames are having a crap-DOODLE of a time scoring with one EXTRA dude on the ice (so far they've scored like, twice out of approximately 178 chances), but when they're DOWN one dude, watch out!  Unbelievable!  Anyway, the first scoring play started with Calgary killing a penalty, when Jarome Iginla intercepted a cross-ice pass at the Flames blueline and with two Sharks draped all over him, hauled them both along on his way to the net and the first goal of the game (at 6:27 of the first period).  Then only minutes later (at 8:29) another breakaway advantage was capitalized when Marcus Nilson shook off a major hook around the neck and passed off to Ville Niemenen, who threw the puck by Nabokov to make it 2-0.  So tonight is the sixth game of this 7 game series.  And if Calgary wins ... but OH YEAH.  OH NO.  They're playing at home in the Saddledome.  Yikes!  Unless they can break this "at home jinx" that has a strong hold on them, we'll all be watching a game 7 in San Jose on Friday.  In my home town of Calgary, this is what they call a barn-burner.  And tonight, at 6pm PST, you will find hubby and myself firmly in place in front of the t.v.  Maybe we'll meet you there?  Cheers all.

        Okay, so yesterday's game was ... I don't know, disappointing?  I hope tonight the Flames that I know & love will show up at the "Shark Tank."  I mean, let's face it, even if they lose this series they've had a great run & went further than anybody ever thought they would.  I agree with what  urlLink Eric Francis of the "Calgary Sun"  had to say about sitting Chris Simon, too.  And that's all I have to say about that.  So now I gotta go get into my "dress reds" and keep the faith alive.

      Good day, eh?  Well, it’s 3 hours to game time (Flames-Sharks) and I had to make my timely tribute to my Calgary Flames.  Why do I say “had to?”  For a couple reasons: 1.  I am highly superstitious when it comes to sports (that was hard for me to say because I’m superstitious about SAYING I’m superstitious), and since I started paying tribute at the beginning, I must continue or … well, YOU know; 2.  I was a cheerleader in high school (yeah, I REALLY was), and totally believe in always supporting your team to the best of your ability; and 3.  I am savouring every aspect of the journey to the utmost because eventually, no matter what, this fun will all come to an end.     GO FLAMES GO!

      Okay, eh.  I said I'd be back and here I am.  I've been meaning to post about this for quite some time (while I was still a contributor to my  urlLink hubbies  blog, that is), and now that the  urlLink nomination date  for "Greatest Canadian" is upon us, I had to get off my can and just DO it.  Coming from my beautiful homeland that I love so very dearly (and that for some reason unfathomable to me) is steeped in overwhelming humility,  urlLink Terry Fox  absolutely warmed my soul.  Terry Fox changed all that.  And that is one of the reasons I love him so.    urlLink Unbelievable!   This young man, who lost his leg 6 inches above the knee at 18 to bone cancer united a country that SO badly needed it.  Provided Canadians with a true identity for (arguably) the first time in our country's history.  Cancer is such an unbelievably unforgiving disease, and he understood all too well what it cost him and the millions of others that suffer from it.  The difference between him and the multitudes (not to belittle their experience, everyone deals with this disease in their own way), was that he stood up and said "No."  I will not allow this to go on for one more day without trying to DO something about it.  He watched little children, dying and suffering all around him while he was going through his treatment) and absolutely couldn't stand by.  He decided that he would run across the second largest country in the world (second to Russia), and try to raise money for cancer research.  On one good leg and one prothesis.  He called it his "Marathon of Hope."  He said that his goal was to have every Canadian pledge $1.00 to the cause.  He trained for 9 months to prepare himself (running over 3,100 miles), then attempted to generate media interest which he didn't succeed at.  Undaunted, on April 12, 1980 he dipped his artificial leg in the Atlantic ocean off the coast of Newfoundland, and began his journey.  He ran an average of 26 miles a day.  For 143 days.  That is the equivalent of running the  urlLink Boston Marathon  daily.  The only thing that stopped him from completing his goal was a phone call he received from his doctor on September 1st.   urlLink He had cancer again .  This time in his lungs.  On June 28, 1981, Terry  urlLink lost his fight with cancer .  His death marked the first (and only) time I heard about the death of someone on the radio, and wept.  This story DOES have a happy ending.  Every year since his death, there has been a nationwide "Terry Fox Run," the funds of which all go to cancer research.  To date, he (and his memory) have raised more than $340 million dollars.  And that is why he is my nomination for "The Greatest Canadian."

      For my first “real” post on my beautiful new blog, I MUST thank my incredible  urlLink hubby  for creating it for me.  Didn’t he do an awesome job?  And am I a lucky girl or what?  I have to say though, I'm going to have to find a better time to post.  This is really not the best time in the world that I could pick and really not conducive to creative thought (I think you can all guess where I am).  I will also have to work on thinking up interesting, thought-provoking, or merely google-ish titles, because right now I totally SUCK at it.     Thanks  urlLink Kim , for the link to  urlLink creamed peas . What an AWESOME idea! Well, maybe not if you're on the receiving end, but ...  The idea is, if you have a beef with someone, send an email to Jennie and tell her all about it.  Blow off some steam and REALLY let whoever pissed you off have it.  If you include their email address, she'll even forward it on to them.  I read her "Best of" and found them to be fascinating.  There's one I read in " urlLink Confessions " (one of her archives) that totally made chills run down my back.  I'm gonna get the heck outta here right now, but I'll be back later.  Ciao for now, brown cow.

        In the towns of  urlLink Bény-sur-Mer  and  urlLink Cintheaux in Normandy are Canadian war cemeteries, holding the bodies of about 5,000 Canadians killed liberating the region from Nazis.  The cemeteries are immaculately kept.  Perfect rows.  Perfectly tended grass.  Perfect flowers.  Perfectly peaceful.  On each gravestone, you see the name of the Canadian who lies beneath, his decorations, regiment and rank.  On some, you see a message from family:  "We will always miss our dear boy," or "You gave your life so that the world would be free."  Most graves are filled by men who were 24, 22, 19 and 18 years old.  There are four graves in Cintheaux occupied by 17-year olds, and three by soldiers who never saw their 17th birthdays.  The youngest was Gérard Doré from Roberval, Quebec ... he was 16 years, 11 months old when he died fighting in the uniform of our country in that faraway land.   At this year's June 6 D-Day commemorations at the Cintheaux cemetery, the mayor spoke to Canadian cadets, telling them Canadians were a noble people, and that France would never forget them.  At the Abbaye d'Ardenne, where 20 Canadians were murdered by the SS, a memorial service included a man who witnessed the execution.  He said Canadians had given their lives so that people like him could live in freedom and prosperity.  In a tiny village, next to the abbey, another mayor ended his remarks with words from the bottom of his heart:   "Vive le Canada."   Every year in Normandy near a D-Day anniversary, more Canadian flags fly than can be seen in Ottawa on Canada Day.  Big flags and small, not just on flagpoles at city halls, but on private homes, grown into the grass, painted on crosswalks.  Of course, the outpouring of love isn't for anything  we've  done; it's for those Canadians of another generation.  Some lie in those peaceful spots in Bény and Cintheaux.  The ones who landed on Juno Beach:  it's far from our nation's shores, but it could not be more Canadian, because it holds the blood of our fathers and grandfathers.  When the people of Normandy see Canadians today, they see those young men who first charged the shore - who had been told not to stop no matter who fell beside them, be it brother or best friend.  They see us as the liberators of their land.  They honour our past by knowing it.  And when a small town mayor in France delivers a stirring and heartfelt  "Vive le Canada,"  it is our duty to make sure the Canada in his mind didn't die 60 years ago.  God Bless our land, our people and our history.  Everyone have an amazing (and safe) Canada Day.  Eh?

      First I would like to apologize to any of my regular readers if I insulted them with my post yesterday.  That was never my intention ... however I may have voiced my opinion too fiercely due to high emotion.  And if I have turned them off of seeing this movie more than they felt before, I am sorry ... because my intention was to do the total opposite.  I was only trying to say that this issue is much too important to close your eyes to and not go and see.  There is far too much at stake.  If you go and come away still feeling the same, at least you have heard the other side.  The side that is clearly on the record but not as widely reported as it should be.  However, the reason for this post today is not really meant to rehash yesterdays' ... it is to talk about hubby's new job.  No, not the  urlLink one he wrote about  a couple weeks ago ... his new job.  His first job of which I refer to, was a crapdoodle mess right from the start.  First of all, the dude that hired him was the owner of this particular chain of restaurants, not the manager.  The manager was on his honeymoon in Europe, the owner lives in Ottawa.  So the manager arrived back from holiday to find not only hubby as a new employee, but three others, when all he had needed in the first place was a dishwasher.  So hubby shows up for his first shift, no one introduces him, he doesn't have an employee number to clock in with, and the main kitchen oven isn't working.  So the manager clocked him in with his own employee number and told hubby he would assign him one to clock out with.  Then they put him to work running up and down stairs to the secondary oven.  That is mostly what he did that first night.  When he went to clock out the manager was "supposedly" interviewing someone and couldn't be interrupted, so another employee wrote down hubby's hours on a post-it and said he would make sure that things were cleared up.  No paperwork was done and they didn't take down his social insurance number.  The second night he was to work, they called him a half hour before to tell him that since the oven still wasn't working, there was no reason for him to come in but to come in for his Friday noon to nine shift.  On that Friday he took the bus and arrived a half hour early.  He wanted to straighten everything out and get an employee number and his paperwork started.  The manager greets him at the door and tells him that he tried to call that morning to tell him they didn't need him after all.  The manager told him that the owner hired people that he had no place to put.  Hubby came to see me at my office to tell me, and as you can imagine he was quite upset.  As was I.  What a shitty first experience working in Canada!  I was indignant on his behalf and swore we would at least get the wage owed to him, and also told him that since he hadn't wanted to work in restaurants again that it was a blessing in disguise.  Especially to work for one as messed up as that one apparently is.  On a brighter note, he just got back from his second job, which is going very well.  It is only part time (with some graveyard shifts) to start, and is not what he wants to do for the rest of his life, but it is a start.  And that's what matters.  So we are moving forward and life is good.  I hope you are all having an excellent Tuesday and I hope this post finds everyone well.

        urlLink Hubby  and I went to see  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  on Saturday night along with half of Victoria and after viewing the pictures on the 9/11 link, most of the United States.  We arrived for the 7:15pm show at 6:15 and were going to run out & get a quick bite to eat after we bought our ticket but were advised that the line was already forming and that we may just want to get in it.  The line, I mean.  Eventually we were allowed into the theatre, which was packed to the rafters.  Seriously.  And it was also  very  hot in there, which marks the first time I've ever watched a movie in a theatre and not left feeling like a popsicle.  But I digress.  Up until now I have hesitated to write about dubya.  For a couple of reasons.  The biggest one was that I figure hubby and I have mostly the same regular readers, and since hubby writes about the subject often, felt I better find other things to write about.   And let me interject here and say that the reason he writes about dub is not because he is no longer a patriot ... if anything, he loves his country even more than he did before he moved here.  No, the reason he writes about this is because dub has broken his heart.  He has transformed America into a country he no longer recognizes, and terrorizes the people of it on a daily basis.   The second reason I have hesitated to bring this up was out of pure cowardice.  It wasn't huge and it wasn't in the front of my mind ... but in my subconscious mind where all nightmares dwell, I was afraid.  Through the Patriot Act we know that he is spying on whoever he wants to in America, and most likely that extends into Canada.  Especially when your American husband keeps saying things about you that you don't like.  After seeing this documentary however, I wanted to try to say something of what I feel, and here it is.  Even if you think that Mr. Moore is full of horse hooey and that his assertions against Bush are worse, you still must go.  Because we all must see the true face of the man that governs America.  If you believe as I do that a true leader is made up of strength, integrity, wisdom, justice, compassion and humility, and that they must continually strive to be the best of all of those at all times, you will see how far short he falls of the mark.  Without any help at all from Moore or anyone.  And this is what I saw ... your typical spoiled brat rich kid who got everything handed to him all of his life and who perceives all but his own social class as worthless, annoying rabble that he would rather ignore but cannot, as he needs at least  some  of their votes.  The one who cheated in school rather than study and work hard.  The one who had his rich daddy buy his way out of combat duty in Vietnam.  The one who always believed that friendships with people in the right places beat having to work for anything, ever.  But mostly you will see a conceited, childish, arrogant fop who relies on bullies and mouthing platitudes to keep people in line.  He is a disgusting joke.  And after seeing how hard his party and his big-shot friends tried to stop anyone ever seeing this and didn't, and after seeing the pictures of the millions of people that stood in line to see it, it hit me.  Dubya may be watching all of us, but now  we're  all watching him right back.  And I think he has a hell of a lot more to be afraid of than we do.  Because unlike him we have nothing to hide, and now the world will know him for who he is.

        When we finally reached the lake on that long-ago day, we all dropped packs, shoes & socks on the ground, and waded into the lake.  I was beyond hot but my feet were the worst … sweaty, dusty and dirty, sick of being cramped and confined inside my well-used running shoes and just plain sore.  They were so hot that I could’ve sworn I heard PHTTT when they hit the water.  After a short respite, we were all put into groups of 8 and told to make a lean-to and get it all set up for the night.  I remember our “Bushman” helping all of us out.  A lot.  Our group chose a spot right at the tree line to the right of the glacier and made our bed cozy with our groundsheets and sleeping bags.  After some debate we decided to make one big group bed.  Our reasoning being that if a bear came in the middle of the night and we were each zipped into our own sleeping bag, he may be able to sneak away with one of us without the rest being any the wiser.  You know, the equivalent of you or me grabbing a “pigs-in-a-blanket” off an appetizer plate.  Even in sleep we figured there was probably safety in numbers.  While we had been busy with lean-to building, the councilors, CIT’s and Dave the Bushman had been busy creating a fire pit, getting the fire started and stripping branches for roasting sticks.  A few of us set off to explore the glacier more thoroughly and intimately (like by sliding down from the top on our butts), but finding it full of dirt and consisting of icy granules, decided one intimate encounter was enough for us.  So back we ran through the gathering twilight to the fireside, pleasant company, and food.  By the time we had finished supper, transferred all remaining edibles into two emptied out packs and Dave the Bushman returned from whichever spruce tree he had hauled them up into, it was full dark.  We all gathered close around the roaring fire while billions of stars sparkled and blazed seemingly inches above our heads and yelled the “I hate rabbits!” charm every time the wood smoke poured in your direction.  Someone brought out a guitar and one of the CIT’s filled a big black pot with popcorn kernels.  She counted them all as they went in, then set the pot over the fire and listened for the corresponding !POP! from the pot so that we would know when it was done and not burn it.  We sang and ate popcorn and drank the night in.  The clean, fragrant scent of the piney forest, the crackling and snapping of our hungry fire, the sight of little red sparks flying through the air, and all around us feeling the awesome stillness of the wilderness.   Finally we retired to our lean-to for the night, all of us experiencing some level of fear.  Especially once we were all settled into our scented shelters and the talk had ended.  Now we could hear a million sounds, all of them causing our scalps to crinkle.  Eventually we did all drift off, but it seems to me we did have a visitor of the bear persuasion come sniffing around our campsite with curious, flared nostrils.  Or not, my memory could be faulty.  What makes me think this happened is an incredibly overpowering memory of wishing that I had not chosen to be brave and volunteer to sleep in the mouth of the lean-to instead of safely tucked away in the back.  Heaven knows, once a bear chewed through one or two of the outside sleepers, he would definitely be too full to explore further inside.  We woke all in one piece the next morning to the smell of eggs and toast and as a result, were easily persuaded to quickly pack up then pull our shelter down.  The walk down was much quicker but no less painful.  As anyone knows who has ever hiked in their lifetime, the going down the mountain is almost more painful and more work than the walking up ever was.  And being relatively young, there was more than a little bit of grumbling.  But the views were amazing, there of course remained those same obstacles to overcome as we had on the way up, and it was yet another beautiful day.  So all in all we were quite the cheerful bunch singing our way down to the boat dock and drinking in all there was to see.

      Overnight to Crypt Lake   Phase I  Overnight hikes at camp involved much preparation and pre-planning.  First the trail had to be chosen, then the Park Rangers’ Office contacted so that we could let them know our plans.  (For safety's sake, all hikers should be sure to do so.)  Besides the obvious safety reasons, there's always the possibility that, due to unusually high bear activity, you may not receive permission at all for that particular trail.  So now with all the red tape behind us, we may move on to   Phase II  Neatly pack your backpack with all necessities ... extra socks, long pants, lightweight jacket, toiletries, camera, sleeping bag and ground sheet.  Experience taught us never to skimp on must-haves, but to leave unnecessary weight at camp.  The next rendezvous point was the dining hall to begin   Phase III  With everyone already heavily burdened, food had to be shared out to carry.  No one was exempt.  The two things I remember being the least popular were the eggs (which were broken into empty bleach bottle-shaped containers, of which there were two or three and that were not only heavy but sloshed unpleasantly with every step), and the frying pans.  And now, on to the bus!   The Hike    The hike to Crypt Lake starts with a water taxi ride  urlLink Waterton Shoreline Cruise Co.  at the townsite marina to the trailhead across the lake.  The distance from the trailhead to the lake & back is 11 miles and includes an elevation gain of 2300 feet.  Park Rangers will tell you to plan on 4 hours one way, but I'm thinking it probably took us over 5.  The first couple of miles are inside dense woods and lots of switchbacks.  Along this part of the trail we saw several chipmunks, marmots & birds, but thanks to singing the whole way up and the whole way back, we did not see a bear on the trail.  At the end of the two miles, the scenery very abruptly changes to paths worn down into sheer rock and shade is scarce.  It also steepens quite noticeably here, and switchbacks mostly end.  It is in this stretch that we saw the first (of two) waterfalls ...   This one was relatively near the path, and being that it was an extremely warm day we stopped here to wade for a bit and get a drink.  Right before the terrain sharply changes yet again at about mile 4, you are treated to the second waterfall ...   This one comes from the lake itself, and feeds out of the cliff through an underground river or stream.  Most of the rest of the hike is spent in the glaring sun, walking on switchback paths the goats have carved through shale over a foot deep.  This part gave me vertigo and I was afraid I would just pitch over the side ... especially with the pendulum effect of my pack.  Somehow we made it through to the next obstacle.  This comes in the form of a naturally formed, 100 foot long tunnel   that is relatively large at this end, but abruptly narrows down, and on top of that, must be reached by an iron ladder screwed into the vertical side of the mountain.  Getting onto the ladder is not difficult, but in order to step off into the tunnel you must cross over a foot of open air.   If you fall here you will not reach the ground for several days.  Approximately.  As I said, the tunnel narrows at the other end, so much so that we were forced to take our packs off & push or pull them through.  Upon emerging from the tunnel we climbed over and around a ledge. On one side is a sheer rock face going up, on the other side is another sheer rock face going down! A steel cable is bolted into the rock face for you to hold on to.   A short walk later, and you will be treated to a gorgeous view of a pristine alpine lake.  (To be continued tomorrow ...)

        When I was in Junior High School my mom signed me up to attend Canyon Church Camp in Waterton, Alberta ... a camp my mom herself enjoyed as a young girl.  I had always loved the mountains before this, but after experiencing them the way I was lucky enough to in Waterton, they became so much more to me.  Due to its location and the fact that funds seemed to be tight at this camp, they spent little to no money on extras and just focussed on the free stuff right in our backyard.  Which meant that hiking was  HUGE .  Hiking, singing, vespers, eating, chores, crafts, exercise ... and because wildlife figures so prominently in this park, survival education.  Every year an expert was hired and given the title of "Bushman."  Whatever hikes we went on he was always along, and when we did overnight hikes he was the one that hauled our packs of food high into the trees so that the bears couldn't reach them.   Every day started early with calisthenics and exercises, then morning vespers where we would just sit in one of the millions of breathtakingly beautiful spots and get a little closer to God.  Our councillors would pick a different spot every day, sometimes getting us up at dawn and hiking the "Bears Hump" or "Goat Ridge."  At least one day of camp two or three cabins would be allowed to hike over to a closeby natural waterfall in "Red Rock Canyon" where we rode the smooth, slippery rock or jumped from a nearby cliff into the pool.  Owing to the fact that all of the lakes and streams of Waterton are glacial runoff, noone stayed in the water long, but we had a great time regardless.  The day always ended in evening vespers in our little outdoor chapel in the woods ... just benches really, formed in the same pattern as they are in church, but our walls were the towering evergreen and fir trees and our cathedral ceiling was the glorious red, orange and pink staining an early evening sky.  Then away we would go to the evening campfire which was deeper in the woods and close to one of the many rivers that flow around.  Once the fire was lit we would sing every song we knew ... from rowdy camp songs like "Alice's Camel" and "He Jumped from 40,000 Feet Forgot to Pull the Cord," to rollicking spirituals like "Dem Bones" to softly melodic folk songs.  We always finished up the night with  The Bugle Song  ...   Day is done, gone the sun From the hills from the lakes from the skies. All is well, safely rest God is nigh, All is blessed.  And on our walk back to our cabin on more than one occasion, bears were spotted.  Because of the profusion of Grizzlies, Black & Brown bears, and because of their keen sense of smell, no one was allowed to keep anything in the cabin that had an odour.  That included cough candies, or even gum.  One night a grizzly came hooting outside our door scaring us all spitless, and it wasn't until the next day that we found out one of the girls had contraband in the form of lifesavers in her suitcase.  In fact, the first year I attended camp they had a snack hut that sold little goodies like chips & pop, but the next year it was gone because it was inciting all the local bears to riot.  This post is getting long so I will finish this tomorrow, as there is one very special hike in particular I wanted to share with you.  Have an excellent day, eh?

      Hello all and long time no see, eh?  I have been remiss in my posting of late and am feeling crappy about it, but I just won't have time today to do more than be a big fat cheater ... once again.  So I'm  really ,  really  sorry and I will try to improve tomorrow, but for today, this is it.  I decided to post a few of my favourite Mark Twain quotes (which, by the way, is what makes me a B.F.C.), not only because it's quicker and easier than thinking and writing for myself, but also because I have been subjected to more political correctness today than any one sane person should have to endure.  Which made me think of Mark Twain.  Because hey baby, he said it like it was.  He called 'em as he saw 'em.   And that, my friends, is so utterly refreshing in these days of double-talk and tripping over your tongue to phrase everything as blandly as possible so as not to offend anyone.  So I'm warning you, if you are P.C. in the slightest don't read one more word.  If you're not, let's go ...  Be careful about reading health books. You may die of a misprint.   Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.   I didn't attend the funeral, but I sent a nice letter saying that I approved of it.   I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me, I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him to a quiet place and kill him.   I was gratified to be able to answer promptly. I said I don't know.   If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you. This is the principal difference between a dog and a man.   In Paris they simply stared when I spoke to them in French; I never did succeed in making those idiots understand their language.   It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly American criminal class except Congress.   It is better to deserve honors and not have them than to have them and not to deserve them.   It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt.   Just the omission of Jane Austen's books alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadn't a book in it.   My mother had a great deal of trouble with me, but I think she enjoyed it.   Part of the secret of success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside.   Suppose you were an idiot and suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself.   The man who doesn't read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them.   The worst loneliness is not to be comfortable with yourself.   There are people who strictly deprive themselves of each and every eatable, drinkable, and smokable which has in any way acquired a shady reputation. They pay this price for health. And health is all they get for it. How strange it is. It is like paying out your whole fortune for a cow that has gone dry.   Under certain circumstances, profanity provides a relief denied even to prayer.   I cannot call to mind a single instance where I have ever been irreverent, except toward the things which were sacred to other people.   See you tomorrow all!

      Not long ago I asked a friend for a link to inspirational quotes so that I could send one every day to a friend that was in need of a darn good daily laugh.  The link my friend sent me led me to learn more about people I have admired but knew little about.  Here are my favourite quotes by Sir Winston Churchill:    Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and easy, or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter. The statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given, he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events.   There are a terrible lot of lies going around the world, and the worst of it is half of them are true.   Don't talk to me about naval tradition. It's nothing but rum, sodomy and the lash.   It is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations.   For myself I am an optimist - it does not seem to be much use being anything else.   We shall show mercy, but we shall not ask for it.   Never give in--never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.

      I was very interested when I stumbled across  urlLink this story  today.  Seems Tom Conte, the founder of the San Francisco bay area lab in the centre of the huge sport drugging controversy (and in his case, money laundering as well) has offered to name names of guilty officials, coaches and athletes in exchange for probation instead of a prison sentence.  I am hoping that Bush takes him up on this offer, being that it is a golden opportunity to give all Olympic sport a chance to clean up its act.   No athlete should ever feel pressured to cheat because everybody else is.  So what do you think?  Should Conte be given this opportunity, or would you prefer that this whole scandal stayed in the dark?

        Tonight is the first night of hubby's new job, and I'm sitting here with Misty & Homer feeling kinda blue.  It's really quite amusing that I should not be enjoying the solitude ... especially considering the fact that I have always enjoyed my own company and spent many years wallowing in it.  But then it hit me.  I have not spent any time alone for over two years!  Amazing!  At first he was quite concerned that I would find the need for some alone-time, but it never happened.  So anyway, in an effort to cheer myself up and find something funny to write about, I happened across this sweet picture.  And in seeing it, I couldn't help but wish that I were wee bit (okay a  huge  bit) smaller.  Then I could ride along safely and gently in his pocket, just taking in the sights.  I know I'm being ridiculous, and this will all work out just fine.  But for now ... I'm blue.  I'll be back tomorrow, and I promise I will be much cheerier!  But for now, I bid you all a fond goodnight.

        It is very obvious to anyone who has ever read my posts that I am a very passionate person.  I can't help it, that's the way I was born.  One of my hugest passions are animals.   All  animals.  For so many reasons.  In the beginning, all animals were wild and mistrusted humans.  For very good reason.  They knew that humans were a predator.  If they didn't know it right away, they certainly learned in a hurry.  Eventually, humans found uses for animals that made it advantageous to them to develop a friendship, so they did.  They overcame animals innate mistrust and forged a bond.  Probably initially a selfish friendship, but at some point the selfishness gave way to a pure bond of companionship.  For this very reason, it breaks my heart when I hear about animals being abused or mistreated or even tortured for pure sport.  I have found myself walking past dogs tied up outside of stores or banks, waiting faithfully for their master to come back.  And I can never seem to help myself but to stop and talk for a minute and give them some love.  It always breaks my heart to see them be submissive or afraid, because I know that I would never hurt them, and I always wish that I could make them understand it.  Maybe then they wouldn't be afraid.  Then I saw a special on A&E about horrific animal abuses.  And I understood.  With heart breaking I understood why animals NEED to be careful.  Always.  I saw a clip of 4 boys (I can't remember where it was recovered, but the police had it in their hands after the person who found it and watched it brought it in), luring a little Jack Russell Terrier.  They were laughing and calling him.  He was afraid, but he came.  Because remember, we as humans have taught him to do so.  Once they had him in their hands, however, they choked and strangled him until he was unconscious (laughing all the while), and then set fire to him.  And the sickest part of this is that not only did they DO this, but they taped it.  Obviously so they could watch it over and over again.  What ... did they get OFF on this!?!  Oh yeah, that's why I can't stand us as a race sometimes.  I was in tears and horrified.  There was worse, but I won't go into it here.  Suffice it to say, seeing that video has made me think twice about petting a dog sitting tied up outside a store.  Maybe he NEEDS to be cautious of all of us.  What a sad, sad state of affairs.  I could go on forever on this post, with the puppy mills and all the horror stories we've all seen on the news, but I won't.  Because sadly enough, there are millions of these stories out there.  We, as supposedly the superior race can sit back and let this kind of behaviour go on, we have lowered ourselves to the worst that this planet has to offer.  Shame on us.  We should be horrified at this kind of senseless brutality.

        Ever since I saw a wildlife special on the Discovery Channel with Goldie Hawn hosting called "Asian Elephants," and one on A&E called "Why Dogs Laugh & Chimpanzees Cry" (or something like that) and that included a piece about elephants, these gentle giants have totally won my heart.  And when I saw this picture it reminded me of the A&E special I mentioned.  Basically, this special was made because FINALLY! scientists have decided that animals have emotions & feel joy & pain & love, just like us.  (Their next big breakthrough will be when they finally admit that babies can & do feel pain and that when in doubt as to a babies' sexual identity it is NOT permissible when they are two days old to surgically choose their gender FOR them. But I digress.)  These "brilliant" scientists very  kindly  explained to all of us half-wits (who of course, knew this all along) how they had arrived at this decision, then set about illustrating this with footage of various animals.  So anyway, some scientist-dude had (for one reason or another) decided to follow a herd of African elephants that included a very pregnant female who went into labour.  The baby was so sweet, but unusually large for a newborn ... and in fact had been so squished in the womb that his front legs were stuck in a bent position for much of the pregnancy.  Because of this, when he was born his front legs wouldn't straighten.  All through his first day & night mommy and his aunty encouraged and nuzzled and caressed him with their trunks, but to no avail, he just couldn't do it.  Finally, with the rest of the herd in desperate need of water, they started to leave.  They called very gently to mommy & aunty, seeming to encourage them to leave this baby that seemed to have no chance for survival and come to water with them and save themselves, but they weren't hearing any of it.  The herd finally left, regretfully and lingeringly with many long backward glances.  Scientist dude at this point was basically shocked & puzzled that they hadn't left the baby, and then started basically writing the eulogy of all three.  Then, to his surprise, baby started walking ... his back feet propelling him forward inch by painful inch, his front legs balancing on his knees.  Mommy & aunty rejoiced at his progress and encouraged him on.  He couldn't go very long distances & stopped frequently to rest, but all through that night they continued their slow and painful journey toward water.  After each rest stop baby would try two or three times to stand up straight, always failing, but never giving up.  Again, S.D. seemed way surprised that the adults didn't finally just give up & leave the baby, but I could tell just by looking at their loving & gentle faces that that was one option they would never consider.  Finally, near dawn of his second day on earth and at the end of their rest stop, he tried for (what seemed like) the millionth time to stand up straight ... and on the third try, SUCCESS!  All three of them rejoiced together, and near midmorning on that day, reached life-giving water.  How awesome is that?  Anyway, I gotta run, so have a great weekend all :-)

      I have an extremely huge bug phobia that developed after a raspberry-picking incident at the age of 4 when I (mistakenly) sat down on top of an anthill before commencing to feast.  In seconds my legs were blanketed in gyrating black.  From that day to this the thought of a moth flying at me and touching me with its dusty, powdery wings;   or a spider or an ant walking on me with their teeny, tiny (yet disgustingly hairy) little feet; or a bee or wasp walking on me with those self-same feet that come with the added bonus of an ugly stinger hovering millimeters above your skin, makes me nautious.  Even to have one buzz around me because of some buggy interest makes me lose my mind.  Once I started driving this whole phobia showed me just how dangerous it could possibly be.  For me and anyone in my immediate vicinity.  One night in high school I was driving a coworker home.  We had barely started on our journey when a moth erupted from the huge floor vent on the wall by my feet and hurled itself suicidally at my face.  The next 10 seconds or so that passed are lost to me forever.  I came to myself with my friends’ piercing screams in my ears, laying down in the fetal position on the bench seat.  I grabbed the wheel and pulled myself up to see that we had crossed three lanes of traffic!  Luckily there was no one else on the road.  The next time I was sitting in my ’66 Chev Impala 4 door (automatic) on a steamy summer evening with all of my windows cranked down waiting my turn to exit a crowded parking lot, when all of a sudden I heard BZZZZZZZZZZZ-BZZZZZZZZZZZZZ-BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ  RIGHT  in my ear.  I darted my eyes hysterically towards the sound, then creak-turned my head when the source of the noise was still out of eyesight.  There was a bumblebee, the size of a large cherry tomato hovering RIGHT BESIDE MY HEAD.  It was so huge and so close that I could actually SEE the hair on his legs.  Once again, that was my last conscious thought.  I came to my senses when I felt my car SMACK into something.  I was in my (now familiar position), laying down on the seat.  Luckily enough (once again) the driver of the other car wasn’t hurt and there was no damage to our vehicles, but still, I remember thinking to myself that someday this phobia was going to get me in big trouble.  And even with that sobering thought rattling around in my brain, both of these incidents cause me to laugh uncontrollably even today.  Maybe it’s the thought of the look I must certainly have on my face in the middle of these incidents that sets me off.  I’m not sure.  For any of you who have ever seen the movie “Meatballs,” you can imagine how hysterically funny I find the scene where the geeky girl with the glasses and the Minnie Pearl hat (minus the price tag but plus the floral decoration), is attempting to lay down the chalk lines for the baseball diamond.  She’s doing an admirable job until a bee or two decide to come & buzz around her hat and her flowers.  The shot changes from a long one, to a close-up of her terrified face as she runs in panic, one hand holding tight to the chalking equipment, the other flailing the air around her in attempt to scare the bees off.  They finally leave, and the camera pulls back again for a long shot of … her with her death grip on the chalking machine, and the loopy, zigzaggy line in chalk that she’s left behind her.  Flash forward several years to yesterday.  I’m at work listening to my  urlLink favourite radio station  when one of the afternoon newscasts comes on with the following lead story (thanks to  urlLink Kirk Mason , the News Director at 100.3 the Q for clarifying certain aspects of this story on the phone with me today):    "It seems there has been a bit of excitement over at the Mall this afternoon.  In the process of trimming some bushes, a gardener accidentally disturbed two bees nests.  This gentleman (being extremely allergic to bee stings), promptly fled in panic … straight into traffic where he was struck by a passing vehicle.  The victim was admitted to the local hospital with minor injuries."    Call me extremely unsympathetic, but I laughed myself hoarse over this.  Mostly because I KNOW if I had been in this guys' shoes that the exact same thing would have happened to me!  And I'm not even allergic to bees!

        Okay, so, here's the thing.  Last night our cat Misty wouldn't leave me alone.  All night long she was jumping on top of me, walking across me (which was decidedly annoying because one of her nails needs to be clipped so it kept catching in the comforter and then she would do the YANK-YANK-YANK thing to get it loose), standing on the pillow right beside my head with her nose almost touching mine, trying to crawl underneath the blankets with me, etc. etc.  What made it even worse, was that every time she woke me up hubby's snoring kept me awake, so I had to ask him to roll over ... needless to say, neither one of us slept very well last night.  Which is why we slept in this morning.  Man, don'tcha just *love* sleeping in?  The pure rush of adrenaline that SHOCKS you awake, the way you get to run around half asleep trying to get ready in record time?  All I can say is, it's a damn good thing that morning ablutions don't involve dangerous things like sharp razors waving around and ouchy soap that can get into your eye ... D'oh!  Anyway, I had just finished "running through the shower" when a memory that had been trying to resurface finally registered.  And it was this ... the one and only time that Misty has behaved like this was the day before the February 28, 2001 earthquake just south of Seattle that registered 6.8 at its epicentre and about 4.0 here on the island. This was my first "big" earthquake, and it scared the bejeebers out of me.  I was at work and at the first shocks immediately hid under my desk.  The building I worked in at the time was brand new, and therefore, built to withstand seismic disturbances, meaning that the floor was rolling underneath me like ocean waves.  As soon as this memory hit me I started quizzing hubby about his earthquake knowledge to make sure he knew what to do "just in case."  And all you neighbours of ours remember this ... if there IS an earthquake today, Misty predicted it.  Okay, so when I left for work she looked like this ...     (A reasonable facsimile of) Misty Chillin'    so there's probably absolutely no cause for concern.  But just in case, be prepared y'all.  And have a great day!

      I struggled all day with the right words to post my thanks to the Calgary Flames, and for once, couldn't think of a thing.  I finally decided to let an article entitled  Fans Welcome Flames Home  from  urlLink TSN.ca  say it for me.  CALGARY (CP) -  The Calgary Flames, hours after losing the Stanley Cup, returned home early Tuesday to a Prairie city filled with broken hearts and red-eyed pride.   "No one should have tears in their eyes today ... when you consider where this team was just 60 days ago, with a rocky latter half of the year to get into the playoffs," said Calgary Mayor Dave Bronconnier.  "I think it's remarkable that this team put its heart, soul and spirit into really showing on ice what is reflected in this community."  The Flames lost a 2-1 heartbreaker to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the seventh and deciding game of the NHL final Monday. They were the first Canadian team in a decade to make it that far.  About 400 fans decked out in Flames jerseys, red wigs and green hard hats huddled and shivered in the pre-dawn darkness at the city's airport to greet the returning Flames.  "I just love the spirit of the Flames," said Amy Shoup. "It has brought a lot of happiness to our city and I'm really proud of them, even though they didn't win."  Carrying a sign that read Thanks for the Memories, Shoup and her friends stayed up all night, waiting for the team's charter flight to arrive.  The strain of a two-month-long playoff drive - and Monday night's close loss to end it all - was evident on the players as they drove past their fans.  Forward Krzysztof Oliwa couldn't stop the tears from streaming down his face.  Many of the players, their playoff beards shaved off, left the airport without commenting.  Rookie defenceman Mike Commodore, however, wandered into the crowd and signed autographs for more than half an hour and declined offers by the police to escort him to his car.  "We had a great run this year. We needed one more win and it was tough for all of us - very, very emotional," said Commodore.  "But this makes it a lot easier to come home to all these people."  The city has planned an appreciation rally for the team at 12:15 p.m. on Wednesday at the Olympic Plaza downtown.  It wasn't immediately clear how many Flames players would attend the rally. Bronconnier said it was a chance for fans to "bring closure" to the end of the season.  "The fan appreciation is so the players know that this community is solidly behind them," he said.  After Monday's game ended, about 40,000 fans still jammed a commercial strip south of downtown - affectionately dubbed the Red Mile for the omnipresent red Flames jerseys and flags - to commiserate and celebrate both the team's playoff run and the win that almost was.  Although the crowd remained in control, a 20-year-old man was sent to hospital in critical condition with two stab wounds to the chest after a street fight broke out between two groups. Brian Donald Gaisford, 18, of Calgary has been charged with assault with a weapon.  In Tampa, fans stayed out in the late-night heat Monday to hoot and holler and spray each other with champagne.  Ironically, the Flames lost the game but won it all on the editorial page of the local newspaper, The Tampa Tribune.  The Tribune wrote two editorials ahead of time - one in case the Lightning won and won if they lost - and sent the wrong one to press.  "We apologize to the team and to the fans for our terrible error," editorial page editor Rosemary Goudreau said on the paper's website.  "It is so important to us to get it right. And today we failed you. We extend our heartfelt apologies."  The season was a Cinderella story for the Calgary club.   After missing the playoffs for seven years, the Flames clawed their way into this year's post-season and beat three division champs - the Vancouver Canucks, Detroit Red Wings and San Jose Sharks - en route to the final.  They were the first Canadian team in a decade to make it to the finals. The Canucks did it in 1994.  The post-season run brought thousands of fans aboard from across Canada for the wild ride.  Fans cleaned stores out of all Flames memorabilia and decorated cars, homes and office towers with the flaming C logo.  The Flames have made it to the Stanley Cup final three times. They lost to the Montreal Canadiens in 1986 before beating the Habs in 1989.

        Tonight, as a record number of Canadians sit down in front of their TV to watch Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final and cheer on the  urlLink Calgary Flames , I am amazed.  In my lifetime I cannot remember one Canadian NHL team getting this much national support in the playoffs.  Ever.  Is it due to the fact that it has been 20 years since the Stanley Cup has had a Canadian address?  I'm sure that has been a definite factor.  However, there is another aspect to this that cannot be denied ... Canadians have fallen in love with the City of Calgary, the fans, and most importantly, the team.  How can you not love a city that lights a natural gas flame on top of a landmark building and leaves it burning for every playoff game?   How can you not love fans that sell out the Pengrowth Saddledome even when the Flames are playing "away?"  Or fans who, failing to luck out for tickets to the actual game, begin lining up outside favourite sports bars at 8am in order to get a seat there?  And, failing even that, line the streets of "The Red Mile," so that they can cheer on their heroes together?  And then, after each and every game, partying into the wee hours of the morning.  All of them wearing red, all of them wearing smiles, and all of them madly in love with the Flames ...  The Calgary Flames ... underdog of all underdogs.  One of the lowest paid and hardest hitting teams in the league.  Even with every single one of their players healthy, nobody expected them to get this far, and they are all FAR from healthy.  With key defenseman out on the injured list and a decimated, rookie defense corps they still continue to win, continue to play as a team and for the team.  And they continue to have Canadians far and wide, fall just a little more in love with them each day.     Calgary Flames flag shares honours atop the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C.

      Coming from an area that is EXTREMELY young ( urlLink Fort Macleod  being the oldest white settlement in Alberta established as a Northwest Mounted Police fort in 1874), this is also an area where, of necessity, buildings were built as quickly and utilitarian as possible to protect the families of new settlers from fast-approaching winter.  Because of this, I have always envied those who come from areas rich in the beautiful architecture of the past.  Victorian-style houses draw me the most,  especially  those sprawling, old country farmhouses.  You know what I mean, like the one in “Field of Dreams” ...   complete with a wrap-around porch and swing, and a wooden screen door with spring-loaded (squeaky) hinges that opens on a groaning protest and smacks emphatically shut.  Little dormer windows peek cozily out from gabled roofs, the fresh coat of white paint adorning it making it seem as an island standing out in stark contrast against the kerry green of the lawn.  Inside, the kitchen is the hub of the house, full of laughter and aromatic smells.  In the living room there are several bookcases positively stuffed with delightfully fat books that lure you into choosing one to read in front of the roaring fire.  In the bedrooms there are almost certainly puffy feather beds and comforters where sweet, chubby little kittens snuggle and purr in pure delight.  When I picture these houses it’s always in the twilight of high summer.  There are long shadows thrown by people sitting out, catching any stray breeze of the dying day, while the porch light illuminates those sitting nearby and desperate moths beat ineffectually at the bare bulb.  There are crickets, holding chorus in the tall grass; and the cat is sitting at the edge of the light, tail twitching, head cocked, watching for an opportunity to pounce.  The dog is asleep and faintly snoring under the swing, paws twitching as he chases sleep and rabbits, while faintly in the distance is the soft purr and hum of cars passing out on the highway.

      Everyone has their little vices, and (just maybe) a bit of a dark side.  One of my dark sides has to do with a show that MTV puts on (and I've seen on  urlLink YTV Canada ), called  urlLink Fear . It MAY be a big hoax, but if it is, it is definitely not the contestants that are a hoax.  They are the real deal.  The premise of the show is this ... eight people (all between the ages of 18 and mid-twenties) are flown to the closest airport to a site known to have been the locale of hauntings, spirits, and others who refuse to go on to "the other side."  They are then put up in hotel rooms (but not introduced to each other) where they are given a camcorder to introduce themselves to the viewing audience, and to give any bits of information they feel are pertinent to their appearance on the show.  Some say that their family disapproves of them being on the show (usually religious reasons stemming from the fact that their family feels messing around with spirits isn't usually very smart), whether they believe in ghosts, etc. or not, and how brave they expect they will be.  All of them are then hooded   and taken from there to a "safe room" within (or very close to) the site itself, where they are dropped off and left on their own (*chills*).  Once they are all inside the safe room, they remove their hoods, press  START  on the computer provided, and follow the instructions.  First they all draw a button from a bag with a colour printed on each button.  From that moment on, they are known as "white," "blue," etc.  The computer then plays a video outlining where they are, the history of the site itself, interviews with locals who have seen the weird goings-on, and finally, psychics who all voice their opinion of how haunted and/or dangerous the site is.  Finally, one by one, the computer designates a dare to be performed by whichever colour they call.  That person must go out alone (sometimes briefly with a partner), mount a camera on their helmet, and bring a flashlight to perform the dare.  You can refuse to go, but if you do you lose your prize money.  By the end of the hour in almost every show I've seen, there are only 2 or 3 people remaining.  The rest have left in a state of total fear.  One of the sites they visited was not far from here, in Kelowna, BC.   That  one was  particularly  scary!  So anyway, my problem is that the show hasn't been airing for the past six months (at least), and I'm afraid that YTV didn't pick it up again.  After checking out the MTV site, it became quite obvious to me that it's been on a break, but if anyone out there knows more, please let me know.  If, as a kid, you enjoyed ghost stories, you will really like this show.  And if you  do  get the chance to watch it, remember one thing ... turn off  ALL  the lights and snuggle close to the nearest warm body.  Because these are some ghost stories that will bring back memories of camping out, deeeeeep in the wild, hairy woods ... it's pitch black except for one (lonely) flashlight.  And the bogeyman is  DEFINITELY  just outside the door.  *MMMM-WAH-HAH-HAH-HAH-HAH!!!*

      Today's post is courtesy of  urlLink this site , written by Jim Sherman (as mentioned above) and proudly brought to you by the letters, D, U, M and B (to totally steal from another blogger buddy,  urlLink Kim @ the G Spot ).   (We take you now to the Oval Office and a conversation between George Bush and Condi Rice.)    George:   Condi! Nice to see you. What's happening?   Condi:   Sir, I have the report here about the new leader of China.   George:   Great. Lay it on me.   Condi:   Hu is the new leader of China.   George:   That's what I want to know.   Condi:   That's what I'm telling you.   George:   That's what I'm asking you. Who is the new leader of China?   Condi:   Yes.   George:   I mean the fellow's name.   Condi:   Hu.   George:   The guy in China.   Condi:   Hu.   George:   The new leader of China.   Condi:   Hu.   George:   The Chinaman!   Condi:   Hu is leading China.   George:   Now whaddya' asking me for?   Condi:   I'm telling you Hu is leading China.   George:   Well, I'm asking you. Who is leading China?   Condi:   That's the man's name.   George:   That's whose name?   Condi:   Yes.   George:   Will you or will you not tell me the name of the new leader of China?   Condi:   Yes, sir.   George:   Yassir? Yassir Arafat is in China? I thought he was in the Middle East.   Condi:   That's correct.   George:   Then who is in China?   Condi:   Yes, sir.   George:   Yassir is in China?   Condi:   No, sir.   George:   Then who is?   Condi:   Yes, sir.   George:   Yassir?   Condi:   No, sir.   George:   Look, Condi. I need to know the name of the new leader of China. Get me the Secretary General of the U.N. on the phone.   Condi:   Kofi?   George:   No, thanks.   Condi:   You want Kofi?   George:   No.   Condi:   You don't want Kofi.   George:   No. But now that you mention it, I could use a glass of milk.  And then get me the U.N.   Condi:   Yes, sir.   George:   Not Yassir! The guy at the U.N.   Condi:   Kofi?   George:   Milk! Will you please make the call?   Condi:   And call who?   George:   Who is the guy at the U.N?   Condi:   Hu is the guy in China.   George:   Will you stay out of China?!   Condi:   Yes, sir.   George:   And stay out of the Middle East! Just get me the guy at the U.N.   Condi:   Kofi.   George:   All right! With cream and two sugars. Now get on the phone. (Condi picks up the phone.)   Condi:   Rice, here.   George:   Rice? Good idea. And a couple of egg rolls, too. Maybe we should send some to the guy in China. And the Middle East. Can you get Chinese food in the Middle East?  This is obviously a derivative of Abbott & Costello's " urlLink Whos' on First " routine.  And speaking of "Who's on First ..."   DID YOU KNOW?   1.  The only baseball defensive position NOT mentioned in the "Who's On First" routine is Right Field; and 2.  The laughter that can be heard faintly in the background belongs to the film crew and director. After numerous takes trying to eliminate it, the power of Abbott and Costello to elicit laughter during this sequence proved too strong. The director had no choice but to leave the giggling in.

        Well, today I have totally slept late ... too late to get everything done that needs be done.  So this is just a quick post to thank all of you for your support of yesterday!  It meant an awful lot to me.  Also, due to the fact that hubby's got some unexpected days off (tomorrow, Saturday & Sunday), I am also taking tomorrow off.  Which means today will be veddy busy at work (for once) and I probably won't have a chance to visit with all of you.  Due to this plus hubby's birthday on Saturday and BC Day on Monday, posting will be sporadic with intermittent comment-showers.  I may definitely be around more than I think, but I wanted you all to know that regardless ... I will be back!  Please all join with me in wishing  urlLink my parrothead hubby  a HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  That's Saturday, July 31st.  Thanks eh?  And have a great day all!

      Throughout my long working career I have experienced many a thing, idea, boss, co-worker, salary and benefits package.  From my first of baby-sitter (oh, and yes  urlLink When a Stranger Calls , or even moreso,  urlLink When a Stranger Calls Back  still scare me silly) to my current as all-round-office-odd-job, it has been interesting to say the least.  From Calgary to Victoria to Lethbridge to Victoria to Ottawa and back to Victoria, I have seen (and experienced) much, a lot (in fact) owed to my dear mom.  My mom?!? you ask in surprise?  Why yes, says I.  You see, it's like this.  From the time (when I was 2 or 3) when mom took us kids to see  urlLink Mary Poppins , I felt in my heart that I was destined to be a singer.  I sang and sang and sang from morning 'til night.  All through my childhood, adolescence, and even some of my adult life, that was what I felt I was meant to be.  So what cared I for average, everyday things like school and grades and college?  I was going to be a STAR.  So when I came home rebelliously one night in highschool and told mom I was never taking math again in my life if I could help it, and I sure as hell wasn't going to college either, and mom demanded, "Well, what are you going to do then?!?" it posed me.  I was way too shy to tell her I was going to be the next Barbra Streisand ... I mean, if I knew I was going to sing, why didn't everyone else?  So being a bit discombobulated, I told her that I didn't know.  Mom, being a Registered Nurse and a long-time-heartfelt Independent Woman, was probably a bit annoyed with my blithe attitude, but I was young and naive and that is probably why when she said, "Well, you better hie yourself off and sign up for typing class," I shrugged my shoulders and agreed.  "At least," I told myself "she didn't insist on calculus or physics or something horrifying like that."  So off to typing class I went.  This turned out to be quite enjoyable, and an area where I felt my enforced four years of detestable piano lessons payed off.  So after highschool I found my first "real" job (which of course, involved typing) in Calgary and the rest is history.  As I've already said, I have worked many places, and most of the time, jobs I've left have been left due to one of my many upcoming moves (for I have been a bit of a wanderer in my life).  The reason of late, is due to the fact that the office I worked in was closing its doors.  The last job I had where I received my big bonus, was a real going concern.  I have never experienced the like of it before.  During our peak, new people were coming in daily ... sometimes ten, sometimes one, but practically every day for two years, there was a new face to sort out from the many, a new name to learn and orient, etc.  Then one day the high-tech economy went bust quicker than it had gone BOOM and that was the end of that.  So off I went, once again, to peruse the want ads (and oh, what a horrid thing those are to contemplate!).  It wasn't long before I found new gainful employment, but ...  Recently, things have once again gone sour in my place of work.  We all have seen it coming for some time (so the want ads have already been sharing my company for a while now), but it is still disheartening to have to go there and search.  To have it in the back of your mind, endlessly, that your security depends on finding something else.  And just lately, we were all gathered together and told that, until things turn around (which as I have seen all too well before, I know may never happen), we are being put on a work slowdown.  Which means that from now until things pick up (or the OTHER thing happens), we are all working four days a week with the attendant and obvious "cut in pay" that follows.  Which is really a bummer in today's economy.  Bummer, bummer, bummer.  So I've been thinking about some of my blogger buddies and their work ... maybe  urlLink Lynn  needs some help down at the county jail?  Or  urlLink Leslie  would appreciate a hand in her office?  Or  urlLink Carl  or  urlLink Jack  could use an assistant to pass them their hammer and nails?  Or maybe, just maybe, hubby and I could win a million and never have to open up the want ads ever again!  Oh wait!  I just remembered!  I've heard that Barbra Streisand is finally retiring for good!?!    Sigh  .

      In 2000 I had the great good fortune of becoming the proud owner of a bonus from work.  And it was fine.  I determined then and there that I was going to treat myself to a vacation of a lifetime.  Where? do you ask I longed to visit?  Why, the Caribbean, says I.  And I knew exactly the place.  Years ago I visited a travel agent and picked up some brochures for Club Med, juu-uuuuuust to see.  And perhaps to dream.  One place jumped out at me from those glossy pages, and it was that place that I would go.  My next dilemma was finding a travelling companion.  As all my friends were married there was no help there.  So I decided to invited my younger sister (Michelle), her husband (Kent) and their daughter (Emily) along.  I added in the incentive that I would "help" with the expense, and that is how we four came to land on the island of Grand Turk on the Turks & Caicos string of islands.  It was quite a trip, let me tell you!  I wanted to travel with my sister et al, so I flew from here to Edmonton, then on we went to Toronto.  The next morning at the crack of bloody dawn, we set off to the airport where we boarded a plane for Miami.  From there, we boarded another large-ish plane (which kinda surprised me, because many people had told me that all the planes to Caribbean islands were small-ish), whereupon we arrived at our final destination, the all-inclusive Beaches resort.  Immediately we set out to explore ...         and it was all very beautiful.  As it was supper time when we arrived, we set off to one of the many resort restaurants.  The next day we were up bright and early and headed off to the beach.  This was one of my "great disappointments."  For I, who have always loved sand and surf, found that the beauteous fine-grained, white sand of the Caribbean is not like regular brown sand.  For one thing, it sticks to you all over (whether you're wet or not!), and for another, when you   are   wet, it turns into white concrete.  I shit you not!  And then there was the turquoise-y blue water of my dreams.  This was also a sad thing to me.  Why?  Because it is   so   salty, that if a wave splashes in your eyes you are permanently blinded and in major pain.  And if you are unlucky enough to swallow a mouthful ... well, it brought me close to an instant up-chuck.  If you don't believe me, get a glass of water, pour an entire box of salt in there, mix it all up, then splash some in your eyes.  If you don't agree that it burns like fire, and leaves your eyes more bloodshot than a tee-totaller following a five-day binge, I'll eat my hat.  Once recovered, take a nice big swig from that same glass.  I think by now we're on the same page, eh?  Okay, plus, you know how you see every person in the Caribbean swimming with goggles on?  I found out that that's the absolute   only   option open to you if you want to swim under water.  Without swimming with your eyes shut, that is.  Okay, okay, I know.  I sound like a big fat whiner.  It was just such a huge disappointment to me.  So anyway, on that first sunny morning, all of these truths were as yet unknown to me.  We found a choice spot on the sand and set up our towels and our buckets and shovels (just like the old days!) and set Emily down in it.  At first she hated the feel of the sand on her feet, but as soon as she discovered that it was very tasty, she was okay:   This was utterly hilarious!  She just plunked her little bottom down and started grabbing double-handfuls of sand and stuffing them in her mouth ... and   swallowing   it!  And such a look of determination on anybody's face I've yet to see.  All three of us just watched for a minute and howled!  Of course, then the cameras had to come out to record the event for posterity.  Michelle was the first to recover herself and take the situation firmly in hand, picking Emily up, cleaning out her mouth as best she could, then betaking the both of them down to the water for a little rinse.  I trailed along in their wake for moral support, which was when I discovered all of the things I related above.  Well, that was enough for us!  Back we went to our towels, up we gathered them and off to the pool we marched.  The days that followed were quite uneventful, sun-drenched and watery.  We spent them relaxing at one of the three pools, swimming and paddling about, visiting the swim-up bar for the odd cool beverage, and eating our faces off.  Until the day that Michelle & Kent talked me into going snorkeling.  I actually thought it sounded like fun at the time.  Well.  It.  Wasn't.  I found out I have a decided lack of snorkelling skill.  Michelle & Kent took to it like ducks to water, whereas I was more along the lines of a beached whale.  For one thing, all my life I have expelled breath out my nose when submerging.  This is not advisable when wearing a snorkel mask.  Mainly because you break the seal that is keeping the water from getting inside and ultimately,   in your eyes  !  Plus, I had earrings in with looooooong posts, and the snorkel strap that went around my head covered my ears, thereby firmly pressing said (pointy, pointy) posts into my head.  I tell you from experience, your head is not meant to be a pin cushion.  Plus, the water was a bit rough that day and tended to toss me around a bit.  Plus, every time I attempted to get a bit below the surface, the water was so buoyant that I kept popping back to the surface like a champagne cork.  Plus, every time I put my face in the water I expelled breath through my nose, broke the seal on my mask, and had to flip over quick and fix it.  Plus, whenever I got close to actually succeeding at getting under, a wave would come along and fill my snorkel tube, which I promptly   swallowed  .  My yes, dear friends and neighbours, as you may suspect, it wasn't long before I decided the jig was up and I was going back to the boat.  With all the water that I'd swallowed my tummy was feeling quite unhappy, so when I got to the boat I just hung off the platform for a bit to regather my composure and try to settle my stomach.  I was hanging there, looking up at Michelle (who, by the way, was laughing her   ass   off at me and who was also standing amongst a small crowd of onlookers), when it happened.  The hugest belch in the history of the world erupted before I even knew it was on it's way.  Oh, how to regather dignity after such a thing!  I'm sure not a person on earth would be equal to the task!   If you are still with me (for I know I have rambled on like never before), I'll leave you with a few more pics before I go.     When Emily was small she was not much of a talker.  Michelle found it frustrating communicating with her, so she taught her a little bit of sign language.  Her index finger pointed at the center of the palm of her other hand meant "more please."  In this picture she is telling Michelle she wants her to read the book to her "more."  I thought this was so sweet.

      Every time the summer olympics roll around dear memories of Lillian Cazubo's dance studio on 16th Avenue North in Calgary rush back.  It was located in a tiny old building (that probably isn't even there any more) and it contained the hopes and dreams of many a young dancer and acrobat.  It had a tiny entranceway, and the first person encountered upon entering into those hallowed walls was Tootsie who sat at a tiny ticket window.  She was Lillian's mother and she was a diminutive yet pleasant lady who seemed to me to be quite elderly.  It was her job to take payments from mothers for dancing lessons.  To the right was a door that allowed entrance to a small set of largely shaped steps (which was how I thought of them) where parents and friends could sit and watch classes in progress through a large picture window.  To the left of Tootsie was another door that took you inside the studio itself.  The room smelled strongly of the efforts and toil of many students over long years and the floor was covered with hard checkerboard tile, with a drum set on a raised dais centered on the right wall.  At the back of the room (beside yet another door that led down to the basement and the changing rooms) was an old, upright piano, where Sliver (Lillian's dad) sat always at the piano bench, twiddling his thumbs (literally) and ever and long awaiting his cue.  The studio walls were covered with pictures like these ...             that went far in encouraging up-and-comers to excel and succeed.  Mom enrolled my brother and sister and I in classes when I was 4, my sister was 5 and my brother 7.  My sister and I were in tap class, but all three of us were in acrobats.  I'm not sure, through the years there  might  have been a more clumsy, inelegant tap dancer than myself, but I wouldn't bet on it.  My sister, of course, was everything I wasn't.  Elegant, talented and very athletic.  (She was also enrolled in ballet, jazz and baton ... and yes, she excelled at them all.)  But acrobats ... that was what I did best.  The main difference between acrobatics and gymnastics is that acrobatics puts stronger emphasis on agility.  Acrobats are trained very carefully and slowly, where endless repetition is key.  Just as people "train" their legs to allow them to do the splits, acrobats train their backs to arch to the utmost extreme.  Tumbling is something that is left for years until the instructor feels there is small room for injury and the smaller tricks are deeply ingrained and done almost without thought.  Also, when an acrobatic performs a handstand, the desired position is with the back arched to the utmost, while in gymnastics, handstands are performed with the back completely straight.  It wasn't long after I started that I discovered something I probably never would have otherwise.  I had a double-jointed back.  By the fourth year of classes, I was able to put my head between my legs while in a backbend, and if I lay on the floor, pushed up with my arms, arched my back, and pulled my legs up to my head, I could touch my toes to my chin.  Whenever we had company over, mom and dad would always encourage me to show what I could do.  Every year we had our final show at the Jubilee Auditorium in Calgary.  Oh, how anticipated that show was!  I remember mom sewing our costumes and tacking on millions of sparkles so that we'd all glitter under the lights.  I remember waiting in the wings for my classes' turn to take the stage and how very large the auditorium seemed.  It was pure magic.  Not long after performing in our fourth end-of-season show our family left Calgary for a small town and an area of Alberta where nothing like acrobatics classes were offered.  The closest mom found was a gymnastics class.  I attended for a season, but the training that was so ingrained in me was not the training that gymnastics offered (or even encouraged), so there was not a good fit and I didn't continue.  Gradually my body forgot all of its training and life went on.  But to this day when the summer olympics draws near, and moreso when I see a troupe of acrobats perform, my heart remembers and regrets.  Sigh.

      Hubby is loving his job and getting more & more hours because he's totally earned the boss's respect ... which totally rocks!  I'm very happy for him and for us :-)  Extra hours are all graveyardish, which works just fine except some of the time and then I miss him dearly.  So this morning he had to be in at 3am, which meant the alarm went off at 2.  Usually I sleep right through the whole thing, but for some reason I didn't this morning.  I'm instantly wide awake.  So while he's showering & stuff I start thinking.  About how happy I am & stuff like that.  He came & kissed me goodbye before he left, and then when I couldn't sleep I got up & read some blogs.  Didn't comment or anything, just read.  Around 3:30 I went back to bed to try & sleep, but I had a great idea about what to post today, so I wrote it all down in my mind (stoopid, stoopid, stoopid) thinking I wouldn't forget it.  The whole time I'm doing this Misty is cuddling her heart out and Homer is on the other side of the bed (as usual).  Also, since Homer   goes out of his way to eat Misty's food even when his own dish is full  , we hide Misty's food.  At night it goes right beside me on the floor, & this morning she jumped down there a couple times to snack.  I discovered something, every time she snacked she purred the whole time.  Made my heart smile ... I can't think of a nicer way to say "Thank You."  Can you?  Sometimes I wish   I   could purr.  Around 4am the bed shook pretty good, so I assumed we'd just had another earthquake.  We've had 4 in the past two or three weeks ... all centered off the northern tip of Vancouver Island and the last one was the strongest yet, close to 7 seems to me.  So I start thinking how we really need to put together an earthquake kit & earthquake proof our apartment.  I mean, we have 3 big bookshelves chock full of books that should be braced somehow.  And those cupboard door thingy's that lock the doors in place so dishes & glasses can't rain down on your head.  All sorts of stuff.  So I was wondering if  urlLink Ted  or  urlLink Tom  had any words of wisdom on this subject that might save us some time & money?  I'd be really interested to hear.  Of course, if you listen to some scientist-dudes, due to Tsunamai's (sp?) & which way the tectonic plates shift, all we may really need is a big freakin' boat.  Because some say this island will just be obliterated when the big one hits.  Okay, so now you see why I didn't sleep.  I thought these little dudes sure looked lucky, so I'm including their pictures:       I hope everyone's having an excellent day, eh?

      Writing my last post has brought back more memories than I thought it would ... and in particular what really sticks in my mind, is how I miss certain groups and sounds.  All through high school I gravitated toward the big-band sound of   The Little River Band   and (what I liked to call) funk artists like   The Commodores  ,   Earth, Wind & Fire   and   George Benson  , to name but a few.  I had all but forgotten that era of my life, as these artists are either disbanded or no longer mainstream.  It was definitely the trumpet-sax sound that caught my attention, at least, that combined with haunting melodies and songs that made you wanna get up and "boogie."  And I need look no further than my parents to thank for my interest in this music ... having been born and raised listening to the likes of    Harry Belafonte   and   Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass  .  One of my favourite songs of all time, bar none, is   Easy   by the Commodores:     Easy     I know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain. Girl I'm leaving you tomorrow. Seems to me girl you know I've done all I can. You see I begged, stole and I borrowed.  Ooh, that's why I'm easy I'm easy like Sunday morning That's why I'm easy I'm easy like Sunday morning  Why in the world would anybody put chains on me? I've paid my dues to make it. Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be. I'm not happy when I try to fake it!   No!  Ooh,that's why I'm easy I'm easy like Sunday morning  That's why I'm easy  I'm easy like Sunday morning  I wanna be high, so high I wanna be free to know the things I do are right I wanna be free!  Just me, oh baby!  That's why I'm easy I'm easy like Sunday morning That's why I'm easy I'm easy like Sunday morning  Because I'm easy Easy like Sunday morning Because I'm easy Easy like Sunday morning    Looking at the lyric reminds me that it's not a really happy song, but the grooves and guitar combined with Lionel Richie's distinctively sexy vocal are always what I focused on.  The mental picture created for me by this song was something like this:   It would be way cool if some of this music could make it back into the mainstream again.  It certainly wouldn't hurt my feelings if it shut out some of the   crap  , er, I mean rap that's clogging up the airwaves.  That stuff just makes my ears bleed.

         Despite how I hated small-town-southern-Alberta when I was younger, my high school years were pretty great. Especially the summer. That was when I worked nights at my summer job at the Dairy Queen,     went swimming at Henderson Lake swimming pool during the day, and on my nights off went to movies or "cruised the strip" in my mom's '60's era orange custom paint job Chevy half-ton with white flame pinstriping and mag wheels. (Long story how my mom came to possess that truck.) It was a standard, four-on-the-floor (only it was really three because first gear didn't work) with an 8-track player that mostly belted out Beach Boys tunes. Even though we were years and miles away from that era and the beach, for some reason summertime felt very 1950-1960's there. The summer that   Grease!   was released in the theatres made it especially so. Both my sister and I bought the soundtrack album     and listened to it endlessly, sitting out on the back steps on hot summer nights with the speakers turned to face outside and the stereo cranked.   Of course, being a music lover,   Grease!   wasn't the only music I listened to. In 1980 over Christmas break, I listened to the entire "Top 100 Countdown" for 1979 and wrote down every song. Lo, all these years later, I still have my copy of that list. (Click on thumbnails to view larger pics.)  urlLink       urlLink       urlLink       urlLink      I made a legend to "grade" the songs as to how much I liked them and wrote my "grade" in the left margin. Looking back on that time I remember vividly the songs and artists that I loved ... The Commodores, Little River Band, Barry Manilow (I know, I'm a bit of a sap), The Knack, Gerry Rafferty, Foreigner, Earth Wind &amp; Fire, Toto, The Bee Gees and Doctor Hook.   My job at the Dairy Queen is probably my favourite of any I've held in my life. Funny, eh? The icecream treats deeply appealed to my artistic nature ... making the perfect curl on icecream cones and parfaits, the swirling colour of Peanut Buster Parfaits and Banana Splits. And I must say (leaving all modesty aside), that I made the most beauteous parfaits ever!  My layers were precision showing the hot fudge and peanuts to their best advantage with no drips of fudge running up the inside that would mar the effect.   One more thing about summer that always rocked was mom's awesome Borscht!  She used my Grandma's recipe and it was so awesome!  This soup is best in the summer when one of the required ingredients, fresh dill, is ready to hand out in the garden, and all the veggies are fresh from the field.  Here is Grandma's recipe:  1 Ham Bone 3 Large Potatoes, chopped finely 3 Large Onions, chopped finely 1 Head Cabbage, chopped finely 2 Tsp Salt 3 Heads Fresh Dill 1/4 Cup Pot Barley  Simmer the ham bone in a dutch oven for 2 hours.  Add the above ingredients.  Cook on low heat for 1 hour.   Add  1 large can of stewed tomatoes and 1 litre of buttermilk.  Do not boil, just heat.  (For a richer soup, substitute sour cream in place of the buttermilk.)  Vinegar may be added to taste by each diner and serve with fresh crusty buns.  Mmmmmm.

        It's been one of those days.&nbsp; The frustrating kind.&nbsp; I must say that frustration is one of the emotions I handle  extremely  badly,&nbsp;which really&nbsp;all stems from my extremely short patience fuse.&nbsp; Then on top of those two issues, I have always been reluctant to&nbsp;confront conflicts with other employees&nbsp;because this is  one  arena in your life where&nbsp;it is the most dangerous and&nbsp;apt to blow up in your face if not handled wisely.&nbsp;&nbsp;So my remedy (until I can't take it any more, that is) has&nbsp;always been to just hope that if I'm matter-of-fact enough that the person will get the hint and stop whatever they're doing without a confrontation being required.&nbsp;&nbsp;(I have made it a life-long goal to work on improving these things, but trust me, it will probably be a "work in progress" until the day I die.)         So&nbsp;today was the day that&nbsp;action was thrust upon me.&nbsp; And guess what?!?&nbsp; No fuss, no muss, the air is cleared!&nbsp;  Why  do I insist on making life so difficult for myself?&nbsp; So now I feel like a  huge  weight is off my shoulders leaving me free to enjoy Friday evening with hubby, otherwise known as "Date Night."&nbsp; Date Night usually includes:         A Little Song,           A Little Dance,         A Little Poker With Our Pets :-)    I will make an attempt to blog over the weekend, but if I don't, have a great weekend everyone :-)

        Over the past year or so, hubby and I have been "blessed" with two new neighbours.  Neighbour 2 is critically ill, so there is a perfectly good excuse for the skunky odours emanating from his apartment.  However, Neighbour 1 (you see in the photo he's giving the good ole'  one finger salute ) who lives right next door to us is not thusly afflicted and therefore has no good excuse.  Besides which, this person has the B.O. from  HELL , and we're pretty sure, tries to cover this up ... not by showering on a regular basis ... but by drenching himself  TWICE  a day (that's right, not once but twice) in the stinkiest most headache-inducing cologne known to mankind (and probably most aliens as well).  All of these odours blend nicely together to create a unique vintage all their own.  In fact, they have inspired me to give his apartment the nickname, "The Miasma of Stink."   So, okay.  I realize perfectly well that this is a free country and this dude is free to stink all he wants.  Sure, I get it.  But come on now!  It's summertime, so we have our windows open to catch the stray breezes.  Only problem is, the stray breezes are now carrying with them stink of such gigantic proportions that it is nearly intolerable.  So now we have two choices.  Close all the windows and die of heat exhaustion.  Or leave them open and eventually kill our sense of smell.  Okay, okay, we have more choices than that.  We could move.  We could rig a jet engine to hang outside his window and leave it on night & day to ensure the stink is contained with the stink-ee.  We could constantly leave anonymous bars of soap & deodorant at his door.  We could hire a hitman.  Anyone else have any ideas?

       Do you dream of me when the day breaks free And the ebony-cloaked night withdraws with a lingering caress And morning stars, shivering and sighing in ecstasy Surrender to the sun's kiss?     Do you dream of me when the sun is at its highest And growing things stretch eager arms to return this lover's embrace While whispering gently in dulcet tones Of how they love to love this lover's face?     Do you dream of me when the dying daylight lingers In blood-red and lavendar majesty along the bosoms of far-off hills And leaves on the trees are like black lace cutouts Gently tossing shadows at windowsills?     Do you dream of me when the night comes down And drapes diamond ropes around black velvet skies And the wise old moon chuckles indulgently, silently, Yellowly, mellowly on the rise?     I Dream of You.     © VegasBaby!

        Being that these adorable critters have made themselves at home all across North America, I'm guessing that most of you have run across at least one in your lifetime.  I have spoken of my pure love of " urlLink all things buggy " on another occasion, but two incidents in the past week have forced my hand, so that now I must put pen to paper & write about them again.  At work we have a small station set up with company forms and several binders containing the corporate manual, all upcoming conferences that may be of interest, etc.  I discovered last week that an earwig has decided to put down stakes inside these binders, seemingly choosing a different one randomly day to day.  (I'm sure this is so that anyone wandering over to peruse the contents of any or all of them may never be sure of which one he will pop up in, which I truly appreciate.  Everyone knows there's nothing better than a surprise.)  The first time we were, er, formally introduced I was filing the newest conference info.  The binder containing this is dark, so I didn't see the little shaver until he came millimeters from running across my hand.  I jumped around a couple times in pure glee at the sight of him, sadly nearly stomping him at the same time as he had fallen off the table.  My joy at this incident, being mistaken as fear, provoked several snickers of amusement from co-workers, but I felt safe in the knowledge that I had made a new friend.  Which leads me to today.  Needing to file in that same dark binder, I picked it up and knocked it on the table several times just to make sure he was awake.  (Everyone knows how annoying it is to have people just "drop in," especially when you're in the middle of a nap.  Seeing no sign of the cute little pincers, I moved to the filing table.  You can imagine how overjoyed I was when it turned out that he  had  been in residence all along but for whatever reason hadn't come to the door when I knocked.  I discovered his presence by him falling out of the binder and nearly into my open-sided shoe.  This occassioned much more glee than before, I was not happy to merely hop, but ran in place like a football player with knees to chest in a little circle.  Ahhh, what good times we've had.  I also wanted to clear up a few misconceptions about earwigs ...  The superstition that earwigs crawl through the ears and into the brains of sleeping persons probably derives from their nocturnal habits and the tarry or waxy odor of a secretion of their abdominal glands.  These guys don't love  brains !  They're not zombies for pete's sake!  These guys love overripe and decaying fruit, as you can see:   Okay, so now do you love 'em as much as me?  How can you not?  They're such appealing little beggars.  I will leave you all for today, as I must see my doctor and have my tongue firmly removed from my cheek.

        Lucy Maud Montgomery was born on November 30, 1874 in Clifton, Prince Edward Island and died in Toronto, Ontario on April 24, 1942.  She is buried where her heart never strayed, back on her quaint little island home near Cavendish, PE.    I truly can't remember which book I read of hers first, "Anne of Green Gables" or "Emily's Quest."  I do recall that our Grade 5 teacher read Anne to us for English class, and that I read my mom's copy of Emily that had been given to her for Christmas when she was 8 or 9.  Whatever, from the first moment I was introduced to her work, I have walked in wonder at the power and beauty of her pen.  She has the ability to paint a word picture so vividly that I can not only see it, but touch, taste and smell it as well.  Her work has been type-cast as childrens' material, but I never grow tired of re-reading my favourites.  In fact, I feel her books are timeless and ageless and appeal to all ages ... but then I might be biased.  My absolute favourites are the "Emily" series, "The Blue Castle," and then "Anne of Green Gables."  She published 22 novels in her lifetime ...    Anne of Green Gables, Published 1908 Anne of Avonlea, Published 1909 Kilmeny of the Orchard, Published 1910 The Story Girl, Published 1911 Chronicles of Avonlea, Published 1912 The Golden Road, Published 1913 Anne of the Island, Published 1915 Anne's House of Dreams, Published 1917 Rainbow Valley, Published 1919 Further Chronicles of Avonlea, Published 1920 Rilla of Ingleside, Published 1921 Emily of New Moon, Published 1923 Emily Climbs, Published 1925 Magic For Marigold, Published 1925 The Blue Castle, Published 1926 Emily's Quest, Published 1927 A Tangled Web, Published 1931 Pat of Silver Bush, Published 1933 Mistress Pat, Published 1935 Anne of Windy Poplars, Published 1936 Jane of Lantern Hill, Published 1936 Anne of Ingleside, Published 1939   A Selection of Quotes   She was sitting there waiting for something or somebody and, since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then, she sat and waited with all her might and main. - Anne of Green Gables -   "I can't.  I'm in the depths of despair.  Can you eat when you're in the depths of despair?" - Anne, Anne of Green Gables -   ... Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think.  It's splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world. - Anne Shirley, Anne of Green Gables -   It was a little belated, perhaps, like a rose blooming in October which should have bloomed in June; but none the less a rose, all sweetness and fragrance, with the gleam of gold in its heart. - Anne of Avonlea -   Nobody is ever too old to dream.  And dreams never grow old. - Anne Shirley, Anne of Windy Poplars -   "I am important to myself." - Emily, Emily of New Moon -   "I wonder if anybody in the world is awake but me." - Emily, Emily of New Moon -   "I'm glad to be rid of you, you proud, stuck-up, conceited, top-lofty biped. - Ilse, Emily of New Moon -   "I am going to write a diary, that it may be published when I die." - Emily, Emily of New Moon   There was about it a wild, lawless charm that appealed to a certain wild, lawless strain hidden deep in Emily's nature - the strain of the gypsy and the poet, the genius and the fool. - Emily of New Moon -   "Fear is the original sin," wrote John Foster.  "Almost all the evil in the world has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of something.  It is a cold, slimy serpent coiling about you.  It is horrible to live with fear; and it is of all things degrading. - John Foster, The Blue Castle -   If you can sit in silence with a person for half an hour and feel comfortable, you and that person can be friends.  If not, friends you'll never be and you needn't waste time in trying. - Abel and His Great Adventure -   Laziness is a virtue in these strenuous days.  I was not born with it, but I have strenuously acquired it, and am proud of my success. - At Five O'Clock in the Morning -   We had had brotherhood with wind and star, with books and tales, and hearth fires of autumn. - Kilmeny of the Orchard -   "We hear a great deal nowadays of something that is called 'moral persuasion' but in my opinion a good spanking and no nagging afterwards is a much better thing." - Rilla of Ingleside -   "I hate the thought of growing up," said the story girl reflectively, "because I can never go barefooted then, and nobody will ever see what beautiful feet I have." - The Story Girl -   "Nothing is ever really lost to us as long as we remember it." - The Story Girl -   He that is born to be hanged shall never be drowned.   Life which had seemed so grey and foolish a few moments before was golden and rose and splendidly rainbowed again.  The diamond pendant slipped to the floor, unheeded for the moment.  It was beautiful ... but there were so many things lovelier ... confidence and peace and delightful work ... laughter and kindness ... that old safe feeling of a sure love.   Life cannot stop because tragedy enters it.   I shall be dust when my heart forgets.

        The  urlLink Parrothead  and I have a few favourite shows on our top 10 list, but believe you me, our absolute number 1 favourite is the Amazing Race.  The most amazing, exciting, and panoramic reality show ever to air on TV.  Executive Produced by the master of action movies,  urlLink Jerry Bruckheimer  (whose film credits include   Beverly Hills Cop  ,   Top Gun  ,   Crimson Tide  ,   The Rock  ,   Enemy of the State  ,   Pearl Harbor  ,   Black Hawk Down   &   Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl  ; and whose TV credits include   CSI: Miami   and this show, to name but a few), this show performs a few services free to the viewer.  One, for all of you out there that always wanted to travel the world and never got a chance, you no longer have an excuse.  Two, for all those out there who like to study the dynamics of a close relationship while being tested due to stress, frustration, etc. this is the show for you.  And three, if you're the type that enjoys treasure or scavenger hunts, or even car rallies, turn to the Amazing Race and surrender your remote!  You will not be needing it for the next hour.  This 75,000 mile race around the world for a grand prize of 1 Million Dollars is ran by  urlLink 11 teams of two .  These two people must have a personal relationship of some kind (i.e., husband-wife, father-daughter, brother-sister, etc.) and be a legal resident of the United States in order to qualify.  Prior to reaching the starting line, all contestants ensure that they are in the possession of a valid US Passport, and the show provides them with a credit card.  On the first day, all teams start together where they are briefed on where to find their first clue that will put them on their way to completing that leg of the race, plus a minimal amount of cash (usually around $100.00).  The credit card must only be used to purchase plane tickets, all other travel expenses must be paid for out of your allotted cash.  If a team runs out of money the show will not step in, however they are allowed to beg, borrow or earn money, as long as they're careful not to break any local laws in the process.  The first leg of the race (out of a total of 13 ... 8 of which are elimination) is always an elimination leg ... which means that the last team to arrive is off the show.  In Episode 1 last night, the teams traveled from  urlLink Santa Monica, CA to Punta Ballena, Uruguay .   They were all left a vehicle to transport them to the airport, along with two possible flight options.  If any team missed these two flights, they would have to wait for the next available which effectively would mean they were out of the race.  Their clue also told them what their next destination would be once they've landed.   Along each teams' struggling path there fall several obstacles ...   Detours:   A choice between two different ways to accomplish a goal or reach a destination. On the surface, one may seem easy but involves some sort of twist; the other may seem difficult but in the end may be the quicker choice.   Fast Forwards:   Two pre-determined legs have one FAST FORWARD, which allows the Team that completes the FAST FORWARD task first to proceed directly to the next PIT STOP without having to do any further tasks, including DETOURs or ROADBLOCKs, on the way. The trick is that only the first Team to find and complete the FAST FORWARD on the leg may use it; any subsequent Team that finds it will have wasted their time and must go back and complete all tasks. In addition, a Team may claim only one FAST FORWARD during the entire race.   Road Blocks:   A task in which only one member of the two-person Team may participate; in most cases, the non-participant must wait for the participant to accomplish the goal before they can move forward.  All the while keeping their eyes open for ..   Route Markers:   Yellow and red flags that mark the locations of further instructions.  and hoping not to be blocked by a twist new to the rules this year, the dreaded   Yield:   Each leg of the race has a YIELD point. Teams must stop at the YIELD location to do two things before continuing along the course: 1) They must check to see if they have been YIELDed by another team; 2) If no Team has been YIELDed, they must decide whether to use the YIELD or not. If a Team is YIELDed, they must turn over the hourglass and wait until all the sand runs out before they may continue with the race. A Team may use the YIELD to stop another Team only once throughout the entire course of the race. However, there is no limit to the number of times that a Team can be YIELDed by the other Teams.  until they finally reach the (hopefully safe) refuge of the   Pit Stop:   The final destination for each leg of a race, at which point a Team must "clock in." The last Team to arrive at most PIT STOPs is eliminated from the race. A Team will leave the PIT STOP 12 hours after they clock in; for instance, a Team that clocks in at 9 am will leave at 9 pm.  From the monument on the beach to the first pitstop   these teams encountered such challenges as carrying a 100 lb. side of raw beef several blocks to a butcher shop (in order to receive their next clue), and choosing between playing roulette or zipping on high wires between two buildings, then down 10 stories into a swimming pool.  And now if anyone else is interested ... On your mark!  Get set!  Go!

      Part of my routine at work involves looking over a daily energy newsletter with the most up-to-the-minute worldwide details on every aspect of the energy business. Lately, the dominating (and highly depressing) story-line has to do with energy shortages, rolling blackouts, nuclear & coal-fueled energy gaining huge footholds due to oil & gas shortages ... you get the picture. I find this so utterly depressing. Which brings me to my point ...  Wouldn't it be cool if, when the present and future look so horribly dim, we were able to refresh our spirits by going back in time to relive your favourite day? I know exactly which one I would pick ... July 1969 and the moon landing.  I was almost 6 years old, and my family and I were at Sylvan Lake, Alberta with family and friends on our yearly two-week-long summer camping trip. The lake looks nothing now like it did when we spent time there. Now they've almost entirely removed the sandy beaches and returned them to grass. Now there's a huge waterslide where once stood a looooooooooooong metal slide on a dock. Now it is wrecked, but then ... then it was magic.  Every morning all of us kids would haul our butts out of tent trailers and tents, throw on our bathing suits and a little breakfast, and head to the beach. My family had a canoe that us kids would fill every morning with life jackets, paddles, assorted shovels and pails, squirt guns, air mattresses, beach towels and suntan lotion and walk the half mile or so down the curving & narrow two-laned paved road to our favourite spot on the beach. All the way there we sang silly songs like ... "Boom-Boom Ain't it Great to be Crazy" and "The Ants Go Marching One by One." Close to lunch time all the moms would walk down to where we were, bring us lunch, not allow us to go swimming for 1/2 hour after we ate, coat us in Coppertone lotion, pick off the odd leech, and just generally keep things in order. If the ice cream man twinkled by ... and he invariably did 4 or 5 times a day ... odds were pretty good that ONE of the times he did we'd all get a treat. In between canoeing or mattressing excursions we'd "dig for water" or build elaborate sand castles.   When the sun went down we'd build a big fire and roast hot dogs and marshmallows and if we were very lucky and our parents could be convinced, we set off firecrackers.   Even as a little kid I was smart enough to see that the golden days we spent there were special and to be savoured. The most beautiful moment of all was the moon landing ...  That particular evening we all had a bug up our butt that we absolutely, positively had to have firecrackers to set off. After an especially potent and prolonged begging session, we were given permission. I remember that my brother and I were along on the expedition, but not who else was there. We got to the little corner grocery where the proprietor (a little Chinese man), had a transistor radio on. That is where we heard Neil Armstrong's staticky, far-away, other-wordly words ... "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." For a moment my brother and I were awestruck and stared at each other in disbelief, and then we raced outside to see if we could see the spaceship and the men up there.  I am so glad I was alive to experience this event. I am even more glad that I experienced it in this special place of my youth. And if I had a day to relive, this would be the one.  p.s.  Due to the same holiday laziness as hubby, this post is a repeat of one I did when I was still posting on hubby's blog.  Happy, happy, happy summer memories!

        I was never a huge fan of Ms. Joplin, until I saw a biography of her on A&E.  When I learned more about her life, and death, I was saddened beyond words.  She was a woman who was a product of the anything-goes 70's hippy sub-culture, but even moreso, was shaped by events in her childhood that scarred her and, I think, made her even more vulnerable to the lifestyle that finally ended her short life.  She was born in the staunchly conservative, country music loving, small town of Port Arthur, East Texas on January 19, 1943.  By all accounts her childhood was happy, but puberty brought on constant battles with her weight and acne.  These two things alone were enough to cast her on the outer fringes of popularity, but combined with her early commitment to the civil rights movement pushed her out still further.  Rejected and made fun of by most of her peers, she sought and found solace in the works of other outcasts ... writers, musicians and artists.  When your society rejects you, you do the obvious: You reject it.  Clandestine forays over the border into Louisiana ... called going "on the line" ... were a rite of passage, in those days, and one that Joplin was exposed to early on because she ran with the boys in high school.  On weekends, they would load up and drive across the state line where rhythm 'n blues bands were tearing up the clubs.  By the time she turned 14 she new she wanted to make music her life, and developed a love for blues legends like Huddie "Leadbelly" Ledbetter and Bessie Smith and at the tender age of 18, she was already singing in local country western clubs in Austin and Houston, Texas.  Late in 1963, Joplin hitchhiked to California, where she became a part of the hippie movement in San Francisco. She quickly became a favoured regular in San Francisco and Venice Beach coffeehouses and clubs.  After two years in California, Janis was out of control, however, abusing alcohol and amphetamines daily.  She returned home to Port Arthur, Texas and her family for inspiration and encouragement.  Re-enrolling in college, Janis excelled in school, but never seemed content.  She questioned her life's direction and attempted to fit in in her native hometown.  Ever the outcast in her hometown, Janis returned to California within a year. Chet Holms, friend and promoter, recommended Janis as the lead vocalist for an existing band known as Big Brother and the Holding Company.  The almost unheard of rock band took part in the 1967 Monterey International Pop Festival in California, where Joplin gave a mesmerizing performance of the blues classic, "Ball and Chain," and thrust the band into the spotlight.  On the strength and popularity of that performance, Joplin and band were offered a recording contract with the independent record label, Mainstream.  In 1968, Big Brother and the Holding Company released their first self-titled album, which would be followed by the release of two singles.   The band now a success, Albert Grossman signed on as band manager and nabbed a recording contract with Columbia Records, who bought out Mainstream's rights. In 1968, Joplin and band released "Cheap Thrills," which included live versions of "Piece of My Heart," "Ball and Chain," and "Turtle Blues."  The album climbed the charts and quickly secured a number one spot on the Billboard charts, where it remained for eight weeks in a row.  Cheap Thrills went Gold within one month of its initial release, and the band was now billed "Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company."   As pressure to perform mounted, the band indulged themselves in high-priced drugs and binges that began to affect their performance and work relationships.  On Christmas Day, 1968, Big Brother and the Holding Company played their last performance as a group.   Later that year, with dreams of beginning a solo career, Joplin struck out on her own.  An awestruck crowd egged her on during the landmark Woodstock festival in Bethel, New York in August of 1969, and Janis made headlines again.   With a penchant for Jazz always at the forefront of Janis' music, she formed a backup group called, The Kozmic Blues Band.  First released in 1969 by the Kozmic Blues Band, "I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!" would climb to number five on the charts, just as the band broke up.   To handle mounting tensions, Janis had turned to heroin, and her use of alcohol and other drugs had increased, as well.  It was not uncommon for Janis to speak of her drug use openly or perform with a bottle of Southern Comfort in hand.  Recognizing she had a problem, Joplin quit drugs altogether in late 1969, and seemed to reinvent herself with a new group, The Full Tilt Boogie Band.  With a new sound, style of music and lifestyle, Janis seemed happier than ever.  That summer of 1970, Janis received an invitation to her 10 year highschool reunion.  Excited for a chance to "return the conquering heroine" and win a place in the hearts of her schoolmates, Janis attended.  She brought her entourage and her individual style, she was met once again with rejection and sneers.  To be fair, the media descended in throngs, giving the whole thing a circus-like atmosphere, but it was patently obvious to all who attended and saw the news footage, that in her hometown at least, she would never belong or impress those she so longed to.  She returned to San Francisco unhappy and depressed, but ready to hit the studio to begin working on her new album, "Pearl."  Looking for inspiration and an outlet for mounting worries, Janis chanced using heroin during production, and accidentally overdosed at the Landmark Motor Hotel in Los Angeles.  Janis Joplin died October 4, 1970. She was 27 years old.   Janis Joplin's third album was released posthumously following her death. Songs from the album including, "Me and Bobby McGee" and "Mercedes Benz" would top the charts for weeks in 1971, and make Janis a music legend. Janis Joplin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and is still today considered to be one of the most original and talented white female blues artists of all time.  To this day there stands in Port Arthur no monument to Janis, no sign on the edge of town stating "Welcome to Port Arthur, Hometown of Janis Joplin."  For the most part, that small town seems to like to pretend that she was never born.

      Anyone out there remember that t.v. show? I was very small when it used to air, but I remember it sort of scaring me because the opening credits showed a young woman with long blonde hair taking all her clothes off (only showing her from behind, down boys!) and walking into the sea ... and it seemed to me that her intent was not to skinny dip but something far more sinister. The last shot they showed of her she was going under. It was probably a news show of some kind, but I never saw the whole show, just that bit, so I'm only guessing. Anyway, Kim over at Bacon &amp; Ehs asked the question the other day about which  urlLink old t.v. show  would you love to see again, which got me thinking about  urlLink Laugh-In  (because I would love to see that again), which got me thinking of the 70's. So I decided to take a little stroll down memory lane ...                         Remember bellbottom blue jeans with the Canadian flag sewn into the flare?  And flashing the "Peace" sign for every picture?  And hearing about Vietnam on the news all the time?  And draft dodgers?  And petula oil?  I tried to add more pictures, The Rolling Stones among them, but my photobucket crapped on me.  Anyway, I hope I've captured a bit of the 70's for ya.  If not, what did I miss?  And have a great day.  Eh?

      And always will.  However, the passion that I had for it in my younger years has redefined itself ... choices and chances, and yes, even talent (or lack thereof) have made me see things differently.  From toddler, to child, to teen, to young adult I was utterly convinced that I would "make it" someday.  The funny thing is, I never really actively pursued it.  Oh sure, I always sang (alto) in the church choir until I left home for the big city, but I was lazy too.  I always felt that it would come to me easily ... I'd be walking down the street one day and some big music producer would see me (yes, just see me) and know telepathically or some such crap, that they had just discovered the next big Canadian star.  Just writing that line makes me embarrassed for my naive little self, but that was my mindset.  Then, about two years after I moved back to Calgary, my friends & I discovered a great brother-brother act (Rick & Steve Worrall) at the Milestone Saloon in the Carriage House Inn on McLeod Trail.  They were excellent musicians and singers who were the house band and we started going to see them often.  One night we went in and were welcomed by signs plastered everywhere that they were going to have talent contests every Wednesday night.  I signed up on the spot ... and lost.  Undaunted, I entered again.  And lost.  8 times I entered with the same result every time.  After my eighth loss, I was utterly devastated and felt like a total fool.  Obviously I was no good and never would be.  I came to an instant decision to talk to Steve, and approached with tears in my eyes.  I said something like "Am I just crap?  Should I quit singing altogether?"  He looked me in the eye and said, "The question isn't   should   you quit.  It's   can   you quit?"  His answer took me by surprise, and I just stood there and searched my heart.  Finally I looked up at him and said, "No."  He told me then that I had talent but it needed a bit of refining.  "Take some voice lessons," he said.  And so I did.  For a year or two.  I still didn't get really serious though.    For one thing, I went through some bad times and started smoking.  At 22!  Unbelievable.  And unbelievably stupid.  Your voice is an instrument that should be coddled and treasured, not soaked in tar and nicotine.  I did finally go out and find an agent, but that was short-lived too.  I wrote and recorded a song, that went nowhere, mostly because by this time my heart didn't believe in me any more.  I was easily discouraged and easily turned aside.  I played my song for one of my uncles who happens to be a D.J.  He listened politely and then said that it would be a nice little song that could maybe be used to promote tourism in Alberta ... sung by someone else, of course ... so I put my little song away and buried another piece of myself.  Gradually, over time, the dream withered and faded.  Sure, I still went to karaoke and entered the odd talent show, but that was it.  Then I started working for a high tech firm here in town.  A real going concern.  They had so much money coming in that they didn't know what to do with it all, so the entire staff were constantly gifted with treats and bonuses.  One thing they used to do is have a summer picnic where everything was free.  A couple months before my first picnic I was outside on my smoke break with a bunch of friends when one of them brought up the "what is your dream job" question.  You can guess what my answer was.  Immediately one of them asked me to sing something.  I did.  She told me I should go introduce myself to a guy by the name of Gideon.  She said he was an excellent musician who played bass guitar and the trombone, and that maybe we could get together a little company band for the picnic.  I immediately went to find him and introduced myself.  We got to talking, which led to an official request of management to undertake this project and for funds to rent a sound system, put up recruiting posters, and "The Optomystics" were born.  The company arranged for practice space and we were off!  We played at the picnic and were a hit, so we decided to stay together permanently.  One thing I discovered very quickly, however, is that musicians in general are kinda flakey.  Gideon (and a few of the others) were solid as rocks, but for the most part, they were flakey.  You know, like being late for practice all the time.  And loving a song one second and hating it the next.  And going off on a jamming spree in the middle of trying to work out a hard section of a song.  And then Gideon got sick.  He told me that he had to quit for a while, but that he hoped he could play with us again.  And due to the fact that Gideon was the undisputed leader who kept everyone in line and together, that was the end of that.  I was very sad, for the band, but even moreso for Gideon, and hoped with all my heart that he and his wife would be okay.  One day one of the former Optomystics (Tracy) approached me at work to say that she had joined another band and that they could use me.  I went out to a practice and found it uncomfortable.  The two dudes that owned all the equipment were the band leaders and one of them seemed to resent me right from the start.  I went back a second time and decided it wasn't for me.  Some weeks went by and Tracy approached me again.  She told me things were different and that Gene (the resentful dude) really wanted me to come back.  It seemed their old front man had quit in disgust and they needed someone right away to take his place.  Which meant I inherited all his songs, most of which were The Rolling Stones.  I also had little to no say in any new material we tried, so for the most part I was out of my element.  I mean, before this I had never even   liked   the Stones!  I spent long hours learning the songs and eventually, started to feel like maybe I could pull it off.  Thus began a journey that was beyond cool, beyond fun, and everything (except for the material) I ever dreamed.  We played well together.  We were all ultra-committed and dedicated and practiced regularly twice a week.  I bought an amp, a mike and a mike stand, some shakers and a tambourine.  We developed a couple set lists and got to thinking about writing our own stuff.  Tracy is a classically trained violinist, and she converted her violin into an electric one.  We had a really cool, unique sound.  We became "TnT and the Blasting Caps" and started playing at a few open mike things at a couple bars in town.  We played a couple real "gigs" (one of being our company picnic) and then we decided to rent a recorder to attach to the sound board so that we could really get a feel for how we sounded.  Which was the beginning of the end.  The guys all decided that I wasn't good enough.  They didn't tell me though.  They did tell me that they thought we needed more vocal to round out our sound, and started actively searching for (what I was told were going to be) backup singers.  I went on holiday and came back to a phone call from Gene.  He told me not to freak out.  He told me the band still wanted me.  But he told me that they had actually been looking for a new front person (preferably male), and that they'd found him.  Even though I was desperately hurt and angry, and found it especially difficult to remove the knife from my back, I tried to put a positive spin on it.  This would give me a chance to work on my harmonies.  I was going to be big about the whole thing.  Ultimately though, there came a day when I just couldn't stomach it any more, and quit.  Looking back I have to say that if I could change one thing, it would be that I told my parents how I felt.  And worked at it harder.  In the final analysis though, I think I just didn't want it bad enough.  I think that is the truth.  But I can still honestly say ... "Don'tcha know that I love my music ..."
