      Every morning when I wake up I think, "This, this is the day that I will go to bed early!"  I hate getting up in the morning.  I am so not a morning person that I am the anti-morning person.  If you talk to me as I am waking, I will growl at you, even if you are being ever so sweet and tying to gently rouse me.  I crave Saturdays when there are no waking up deadlines and sleep goes on and on and on.  But, somehow, and micraculously, after about 15-20 minutes on the weekdays, I begin to perk up, start making the coffee (thank God for coffee) and think that maybe I can make it through the day without vertically snoring.  I do end up making it through the day, but have to fight like hell not to take a nap in the afternoon.  The hours between 4-6 have become my nemisis.  The problem revolves around the fact that I stay up 'til about 12:30 or 1 everynight (I teach school so this is way late).  There is no real reason why I do this.  I am not writing a novel or developing photographs or even knitting an amazing sweater.  No, you can usually catch me doing, well, nothing I guess.  I can't acurately say what I do each night.  Sometimes I'm reading, sometimes watching TV, sometimes reading blogs online, and sometimes talking to west coast friends.  I used to actually stay up to watch Letterman, but TV bores me more and more lately.    I have always been a night owl.  I can't remember when I didn't like staying up late.  It must have started in late elmentary school or middle school when I can remember watching Saturday Night Live and Johnny Carson with my family (I know, quality bonding time).  I remember in college wishing that exams were given at night because my brain was just so much more alert then and I was convinced this would improve my grades.  I still "wake up" at about 8pm everynight.  This is when I begin getting things done, the dishes, the laundry, the phone calls, the emails, the projects, the organizing.  About 2 hours into my second wind, I remember that I wanted to go to bed early so I don't feel like shit in the morning, but 10pm rolls around and I think I can give it one more hour and then I think if I go to bed at midnight I'll still get about 7 and 1/2 hours of sleep.  Sounds good, but this never happens.  So, everynight I stay up doing things that will sadly not bring to me to enlightenment anytime soon.  I wish that I could say that I have an extraordinary social life filled with late night gallery openings and wild parties, but no.  That's not me anyway.  Instead, I'll be washing my hair, helping my friends pick the perfect bridesmaids dress online or shutting the world out with a book.  Tonight I will be, um, let's see, um, well, how about reading my fabulous travel book on London (no, I'm not going anytime soon, I'm just obsessed) until midnight.  And tomorrow morning when I wake up I will think "This, this is the day that I will go to bed early!"

      Who, pray tell, designed apartment buildings so that you can hear everything that is happening in the apartment below you with almost complete and utter accuracy?  I mean, is it that hard to place some sound absorbing panels in between the floors as you build?  Think, architects, think!    My neighbors downstairs are college students.  Why they live in our beautiful, mostly populated by the elderly and some young professionals, far away from the college they attend apartment complex, I don't know.  And, I actually, don't know them.  I know that one is a boy and one is a girl.  I know that the boy plays guitar and sometimes tries to sing along, mostly Dave Matthews songs.  I know the girl will occasionally put on some Jason Mraz.  (My connections to the above musicians would probably blow their minds, but I will never be friends with these college brats and so they will never know.)  And, I know that I can hear the boy cough at times.  What does that mean he can hear me do?  I wonder about this one.  Tonight, they are listening to the radio and they have what I think is a subwoofer cranked up so as I sit here trying to watch TV or listen to my music, I just hear deep voices and bass.  It BLOWS!!!!!!!!!  So, being the oh so nice and always ready to lend you some sugar should you be baking something neighbor, I turned up my subwoofer to the MAXIMUM.  Take that you slackers!  I am usually quite kind with my subwoofer.  When my brother installed it and put it at Maximum, I told him I had neighbors below and that it needed to go lower, a lot lower.  So much for thinking of other people.   The reason for this retaliation is that I think that they like to bang their ceiling, my floor, when they think that I am being loud.  I am not loud.  OK, so I always have some kind of noise on, I hate quiet, but when I am watching TV and they bang, and I check the volume, it is on 2 bars.  "OK people, I pay enough in rent to listen to my TV at 2 FUCKING BARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  I am not actually sure what the banging is about.  I wonder sometimes if it is my imagination.  What could 2-3 pounding-like sounds in rapid succession be?  One day I came home and as I walked in the door I heard the 2 bangs.  I threw my stuff down and yelled at the floor "I haven't even been here to make noise.  What, you don't like it when I open my door?"    Maybe, just maybe, there is some phantom mouse running around and driving them crazy while I am constantly monitoring my volume.  I can't help but remember the Friends episode where the old neighbor below is always banging on his ceiling when the friends are not actually making noise.  When he dies and they go to his apartment they hear what sounds like a party going on above them, but they are all in his apartment. Could this be what is happening in my building? I don't know, but I always turn down the noise if I hear the banging until, of course, tonight and the subwoofer wars.  Game on!

      Richmond's annual chili cook-off held many feasts for my eyes:  1) William Hung.  I know, you're jealous.  He was one act among many at the festivities and his one song performance of "She Bangs" was almost worth the $20 admission fee.  2) People wearing clothes that should have been retired years ago (or never purchased)- a) Belly shirts- these should only be worn by people who do not actually have bellies and then only when they want other women to hate them. b) Clothing that is too tight- there was a woman who looked normal in everyway except that her tan linen pants were a bit snug above her thighs, and by snug I mean she had a perma-wedgie. c) Stripper shoes- The shoes which I am referring to had a 3 inch clear plastic heel, silver souls, and clear plastic straps.  I know, you're jealous again.  Note to self- don't go to the chili cook-off as can't handle the dress requirements.  3) People running after beer- the beer trucks ran out of beer about an hour before the cook-off ended.  We were waiting in line and when they would announce that the beer was gone people would scatter quickly to another truck, and so on, and so on.  Note to self- don't go to an event where grown people run after silly things, unless there is a sale on at Saks.  4) A woman's bare ass- as I walked to my car I saw that the passenger door of the car beside me was open, blocking my door.  There was no one around and as I got closer and closer I looked for someone to tell that I needed to close the door.  Then, as I approached my car I saw that there was in fact someone behind the door, a woman's bare ass peeing.  Um, OK, um, um, look in the other direction, um, wait, um, don't look, hope that friend tells her I am here, um, um.  When she is done and is pulling up her pants over her bare ass and says "I'm sorry, I just really had to pee," say "It's OK, do what you gotta do" and quickly get in your car and pull away.  Note to self- never, never have to pee that bad.

      When I checked the mail one day last week and saw the oversized, cream envelope with my name and address perfectly printed on it, I thought "Oh hell, here's another one."  I open it to find an invitation to a cousin's wedding in May.  As I scan the card for the wedding, the reception, the directions, and the reply card I think, "And so the season begins."  Every year there is a flow of weddings in my life.  I have probably been to at least 50 weddings since I was small.  Since college, they just keep on coming.  Someone told me that there is usually a boom right after college and then again in your 30s.  Um, there has been no let up in the bombing, apparently the troops refuse to surrender, give up and just go home.  I do have to say that I sometimes, am on the firing squad, well in some capacity anyway.  This year marks the seventh run as a bridesmaid for me  (OK, so 2 of them were my brothers, but still 7, come on people).  That's right, seventh (this does not include the ones in which I will merely be a spectator).  I love my friends and family and am so honored to be included in these special days and this is no diss on them in anyway.  This is all about me.  I mean, it's always about me anyway, right?    This year are the weddings of 2 very special people, my cousin who is like a sister to me and my best friend who basically is a sister to me.  These are probably the most special ones that I will be a part of and in my best friend's I am the maid of honor.  When she asked me, I cried, and then reality set in, this is my 7th time walking down the aisle, alone.  Oh, there are no pitty parties, Anna is an independent.  One friend said, "Well, at least you're getting closer."  I was like, um thanks, that's as close as I want to be, for now anyway.  So, I do my duties of planning and attending showers, giving my measurements to strangers (probably the worst part of the whole process), and being there for the bride in any way she might need.  I do all of this thinking, as Cinderfuckinrella (thanks Pretty Woman) did, that someday my prince will come.  But, oh no, don't think he needs to rescue me, no.  I've already rescued myself.  I want a prince for all the other reasons, plenty of cash, big house, private jet.  No, really, I want a prince who is prince of humanity in that he treats me and everyone I love with kindness, who is so funny that I laugh out loud just thinking about things he has done or said, who wants to learn to do things that I love just because I love them, and who wants me to do the same for him.  I think my friends (and cousin) have found these princes, I know they have.  I'm just hoping that they haven't gotten the last ones.

      I love NPR.  Music stations can make you feel like you are stuck on repeat of a mixed CD.  The same songs over and over.  People, please.  But then, there in the distance, on the hour, every hour, and during rush hour and some good hours on Friday night and Sunday, there is NPR to rescue me.  I like a pop song just as much as the next person, but I don't think that I ever actually will "find [you] in a club with a bottle full of bub," but I do know people who have taken prozac which now appears to be causing suicidal tendencies.  (I heard this tidbit before eyeing it on any other news source that day.)  I love the idea of multitasking, driving and getting abreast of what is, or is not, going on in the world.  I can't watch news on TV anymore, unless it's BBC and then only when I'm actually in England, because the inane (trying to be) analytic dribble drabble that procludes from these people's mouths is too much for me to stand.  I tell my father everytime that I am home that FoxNews is one of those broadcasts that actually does write its copy for people with an 8th grade education because that is there audience (if you didn't know, that's suppose to be the industry standard for level of writing, 8th grade, yeah I know).  He just ignores me and continues to be "dumbed down."  Newspapers are fine, but I don't have the dough to subscribe to them and reading a newspaper online just doesn't seem right to me.  And so, when I get in my car and I'm just sick of hearing the same 4 songs, I check the clock and thank God that it is after 4 in the afternoon and there is information to be learned as I drive  home.  Some days, I even leave early in the morning so that I can hear the more in-depth news as I drive in (the closer you get to 9am the more "entertaining" the pieces get).  I mean, all things considered I just need a little fresh air to handle this American life.

      Today I heard a school secretary say to a little girl, "Now, you're not going to get suspended anymore, are you?"  As I passed by the conversation I wanted to say, "No, you're wrong.  This little GIRL wouldn't do something to get suspended.  I mean look at her, she's cute, well-dressed, calm, and polite."  And then metacognition set in and I realized that I had just committed a mental act of sexism.  Our mothers might not understand why this scene might make us step back and take note of our place on the "balance of the sexes."  My mother didn't even begin college until I, her third child, was in elementary school.  And she is the only one of her sisters to have a college degree.  A few years ago, she got her Masters in Administration (approximately 1 year before I go my Masters), hoping to become a school principal.  It seems that her age has hindered those hopes, sexism replaced by ageism.  (My mom is older than my friends' parents.  She has a 39 year-old son after all.)  I'm not sure if this is really true, but she continued teaching and thanks to Bush's unfunded No Child Left Behind, she has, in fact, been left behind.  It now appears that she must have in hand a different type of Masters to do the same job she's been doing for 3 years.  But, I'm sure that 40 years ago she never would have thought she'd be worrying about what type of Masters Degree she had.  Former generations of women only hoped that women would have as many choices and possibilities that we do now, but with the entire world laid out before us, what do we really have but more questions?  What if we just want to be married and have children?  And that's it.  What if we want it that simple?  Is it sacrilege to not take advantage of the choices, or is that the whole point anyway?  I personally would feel no shame in dropping the 50,000 dollars and 20 plus years spent on my education to be a happy homemaker.  But, alas, baby making and the perfect spinach quiche are not the path I stumbled onto, nor will it be anytime in the near future.  After all, I have a research project due for my "might turn into a PhD" class.

      When riding my bike and a slight hill appears I must use all my leg power to tackle the mere incline (I'm not talking real hills).  As I'm peddaling with more and more emphasis I can't help but be aware of my powerhouse legs.  My calves are huge and this is not actually related to me being overweight.  There are two reasons for my treetrunk legs.  First, there is genetics (I know, blame your mother).  But seriously, I've never seen the women in my family ever really break a sweat, sure there is the occasional walking of the dog, but no intense exercise going on, and yet these women do not have dainty legs.  We have legs built for... well I don't know what for.  The second reason is Linda Watkins School of Dance.  I was a dancer from age 4 to 18 and dancers have powerhouse legs, how else could they leap like that?  I tapped, balleted, toed, and jazzed my way through 14 years of jetes, plies, and time steps.  I usually hated dance class, but the recitals I lived for.  There is nothing like being on stage and performing.  My favorite was the kick line.  And still, years later, when I hear Elvis Costellos' "Hot Hot Hot" (which is not that often) I want to throw some eye high kicks and do a split, oh there were splits.  Sadly, I couldn't do a split now if you paid me.  I miss the way a dancer knows her body, how every move is fluid and somehow perfectly calculated, even walking can be a dance.  Our dance instructor used to tell us a story about a dancer's grace.  The story goes that she was coming home from the grocery store holding a bag of groceries in each hand.  When she stepped up her back stairs to her house, she slipped on a thin layer of ice.  And this is where the grace comes in- she would emphasize that because she was dancer, she knew how to fall and thus landed safely on the ground, legs folded perfectly to soften the full body blow.  The strange thing is that I don't remember ever practicing or in fact ever falling in dance class, but I understood what she was saying.  A dancer's right hand always knows and reacts to what the left hand is doing.  I've never broken a bone, pulled a muscle, or torn a ligament, could this be due to the dancing?  I don't know but, thanks to Linda Watkins, when I'm 85 and fall down my front stairs, I may not in fact break my hip.

      I was cruising on my bike through Windsor Farms today.  It's a posh neighborhood in Richmond's westend where the houses are big and beautiful, the yards are kept up by hired hands I'm sure, and all children go to St. Catherine's, or St. Christopher's (cause being educated along ghettofied kids is to much of a reality for these folks).  OK, so I would like to own a house here, but my kids would go to public school, damnit.  On my bike tour past the beautiful AgeCroft (yes, some aristocratic cook had the house torn apart and shipped over here from England, but this was a long time ago when ghettofied kids would have been slaves).  The house is amazing and has a prescious spot in Richmond, it rests on a small hill and looks out to a small mountain which has not been tainted with developments.  It's serene, and reminds me of my hometown and of my last home, C-ville.  Growing up among moutains, I hated them.  My hometown is in a valley and therefore surrounded on all sides as if the hills protect and keep the people below.  And, in many ways they did, my hometown is a sheltered place.  Though quaint at times, it could possibly be the redneck version of "A City Upon (surrounded by) A Hill (hills)."  But, we all know what happens to Utopia, oh yeah, it doesn't exist.  So, for most of my life I have cursed the moutains and hills, especially when trying to learn how to drive a stick shift (I actaully gave up trying for a good year).  I didn't start to accept and reclaim them until this past summer in Montana.  I traveled to Montana for a friends wedding and when I stepped off the plane and found myself surrounded by mountains I thought I was back in my hometown except there are no semi-tall buildings and I don't think they know what urban sprawl is.  Throughout the weekend I kept thinking, "What is so great about these moutains?"  OK, so they are huge and the ranges are much bigger than Virginia's and they are bit more pristine, but really, no Virginian would be that amazed as I wasn't.  Then when drving back to C-ville from the airport in DC and going up and down the rolling hills, I thought "These are my hills, Montana has nothing on these."  I think I began to love my state then.  I'm proud to be a Virginian which is saying something, considering I have always wished to be an North Carolinian.  Richmond has no hills or mountains to look at, we're too far east.  I actually miss them.  Some days as I'm driving to work I feel like I don't have everything that I need for the day, I check everything, my watch, my purse, my coffee and I and can't find the missing piece, but maybe it's the moutains, the Blue Ridge, that I'm missing, without really knowing it.

      My sister-in-law had an embroidered pillow which rested on her white loveseat which sat in an area off to the side of her kitchen in her former house.  The pillow said, in green thread, "Bloom Where You're Planted" and of course had simple, colorful flowers sprouting underneath the words.  The first time I saw this pillow, I thought "What a great saying."  After 3 eye-opening, ego-blasting years in a teaching position that drove me to see a therapist, a move to a new city, a new job, and lots of downtime, I can now see the sunlight.  The cloud which followed me around all my life, much like the dust cloud that follows PigPen from Charlie Brown, has lifted.  The weather is not always clear, it rains and storms still, but mostly there are sunny days.  I've moved to Richmond to start over and when I first moved here I was so excited and thrilled to begin again and to do it right this time.  Well, 6 months into living here, I was not happy.  The cloud was back, my apartment was a shambles, and I hated waking up to go to work every morning.  I was obsessed with New York City and sad that I could not afford to move there or to London, or anywhere.  Then I began to repeat and reflect on that pillow in my sister-in-laws kitchen.  And while I'm not ready for blooming, at least for now, I think I'll germenate.  And I'm sure, with all this sunlight, a stem will form.   Next Time  Ginko trees live 1,000 years. Eating the leaves will clear you brain. When I heard about them, I thought of my mother, how much I would like to sit under one with her in the ancient shade, nibbling the flesh, the stem, the central vein.  ~Naomi  Shihab Nye

      I love the bridges of Richmond.  They are no architectural triumphs by any means.  They are simple and quiet, sometimes elegant, and to me, quite satisfying.    My favorite is the Nickel bridge.  It is a small two lane bridge that is made of intricate iron workings on either side and is lighted by short lamps which are part of the iron work.  It is a quaint bridge and one of the quite one I think.  As cars pass each other in close proximity, it's as if they are quitely saying hello to each other.    The one I take to work everyday, the Powhite Pkwy, is a toll bridge and although I pay everyday and hope that my $.50 will soon make enough of a difference that the tolls will soon go away, I make sure to enjoy the view on either side of me.  On the left is a train bridge that was clearly built when we took time for grandeur and beauty in transportation.  The train bridge is grey stone with slender arches that reach just under the flat top.  Everytime I look at this bridge I imagine riding in a cafe car on a train in the 20s, sipping tea and headed south to somewhere fabulous.  Just visible beyond the train bridge is the Nickel bridge, much shorter than the train bridge and sometimes I think it is a whisper of a bridge in the distance.  Back to the right side of the Powhit bridge.  On the right is only the James river and it's tree lined banks.  The river is a bit rocky at this point and every morning I can gauge the level of percepitation west of Richmond.  When the river is at a normal level, birds perch on some rocks that barely rest above the water level.  The first time I saw I bird sitting on one of these tiny rocks, I wondered if he thought himself a daredevil.   The Hugenot bridge is at the end (or beginning) of Cary St.  It extends into the posh westend of Richmond.  This bridge is two lanes with rails on either side that mimic a picket fince in metalic piping.  But, it's length is what is so fascinating.  It goes for at least a quarter mile and part of is not over water at all.  When you start the bridge from the Cary St. side you enter and curve around into a grove of trees.  Because it's a bridge a this point, you feel as if you are suspended through a small forest.  As you curve around, train tracks appear quickly and then the banks of the of the river.  It's a bit like a fairytale bridge, no exactly magical, but unnexpected.  The Willey Memorial Bridge mimics the Hugenot bridge in length and setting, but is far different in description.  The bridge is all concrete and lit by standard street lights.    The Lee Memorial bridge is my least favorite.  It connets downtown to a area that could be referred to as the "projects," a sad and large part of this troubled town.  This bridge is open to pedestrians on either side so that the blank concrete feel is even more guarded by chain link fencing.  Although the bridge is wide with four lanes, you feel boxed in and can't see the water underneath.  The idea and realization of being suspended over rushing water does elevate the drab feel of this bridge for the brief trip over the James.  The 2nd st. bridge is another non-descript bridge, but on the downtown bank there is a memorial to Vietnam veterans of Virginia.  It's a beautiful memorial, a large stone wall in the background, a grand shape of a women inside, behind a glass wall.  I've haven't seen it up close, it's on my list of things to do.  Just the other day I discovered an walking suspension bridge under the 2nd st. bridge.  The walking bridge literally hangs below the towering car bridge above.  It reminds me of the Millineum Bridge in London, another beautiful walking suspension bridge.

      My name is Anna and I reside in the old town of Richmond, VA.  I'm a Virginian by birth, but this my first time living in the capitol city.  I'm a teacher for children with special needs in public schools.  I used to teach children with Autism which was fascinating.  For a long time, Autism was my passion.  At times, I still yearn to work with those kids again.  I'm damn good at it, but the culture of Autism is too abrasive for me.  It's a complicated, long story.  I love the kids, it's just everything that surrounds them and thus henders a teacher's effectiveness was too much for me.  I like what I do now, but not sure if I love it.  What does it mean to love a job?  What does it mean to love anything?  I just turned 27 with no fanfair and am in the throws of confusion and searching that inhabits all 20somethings.  Things about me:  when "Sex and the City" ended I felt like my best friends moved away.  I love my nieces and nephew.  I love to read pop fiction (yes, Bridget Jones is a friend of mine).  I have TiVo.  I used to write poetry (fairly seriously in college and worked with some big names).  I have a very well decorated apartment, it's beautiful if I do say so myself.  I love to cook and don't do it enough.  I need to learn to exercise frequently.  I wish that I could: take amazing photographs, publish some poems/ book/ picture/ dna, travel to any city anytime, live in NYC, live in London, etc.

      Do you remember watching music videos?  I mean really watching them, like for hours.  My brother and I, along with some neighborhood kids at times, would sneak snippets of MTV.  We were banned from such filth as kids though we seemed to watch endless amounts of it, our parents not as quick as they were prudish.    I was enamored with George Michael.  Funny, he never seemed gay to me at age 10, but then again I didn't know what gay was then either.  He was the perfection of hotness to me and that song, Careless Whisper, where he crones after a lover lost and that stubble, whew that stubble.   These days, he's not so hot and I wonder why I never saw the obvious "batting for the other team" going on, but again, this was the 80s, I don’t think he was letting many people in on his secrets, lest he lose album sales.  A few months ago I was flipping through the channels and found FUSE, a music video channel here in Richmond where all they do is play videos.  I was stunned.  Some flashy hip-hop song was on and I paused, filling the commercial time during another program and actually watched a whole video.  I felt like I was 12 again, the volume turned down, the den door closed, and my finger on the remote ready to switch channels should the door open and my mother walk in.   I haven't watched another video since that FUSE moment months ago.  I miss the old videos where the stories were weak, if anything, the bands were overly made up, and the women had clothes on.  The current generation has no idea what endless, mindless hours of music videos are like.  They think MTV was created to expose the unreality of 18-23 lives.  The teeny boppers today won't have slumber parties and stay up late to see how many times their favorite videos appear.  They're lucky if they see their favorite video once during the terribly drab TRL.    And, what happened to a music video doing magic for the unknown artists?  The one hit wonders of the 80s would be nowhere without their videos.  Remember Divo and the whips?  My brother's band made a video a few years ago.  And if you blinked you missed it.  It did nothing for them because kids don't watch videos anymore, they want the (non) reality shows or the watered down, over-produced, uncreative pop star in their mist, and they only want the 10 best knows videos of the day.  Or at least, this is what MTV thinks they want.  MTV has gone from groundbreaking to heartbreaking.  And VH1, don't even let me go there.  And it's sad to realize that I am no longer the target audience of MTV.  They don't care about my demographic anymore, even though I busted my butt sneaking hours of videos into my childhood.  Sorry Dire Straits, you can have your money for nothin'.  It turns out I don't want my MTV.

      I was playing with my 3 year-old niece today when she said "I'm the king of the castle."  Then pointed to me and said, "You're the dirty rascal."  And I was immediately placed inside the melody of CRASH.  I was irrovacably sadden that my childhood is now wrapped inside the lyrics of a Dave Matthews song.   Then later, in the backyard waiting for the hotdogs on the grill I heard a bright, highpicthed song lingering in the air.  I knew immediately that it was an ice cream truck.  Whew!  How long has it been since I've seen on one of those.  Oh, the days of yore.  *sigh*

      I'm funny.  Ask my friends; they'll tell you I'm funny.  It's my thing, my party trick.  I come from a long line of funny people.  No, none of them are famous.  We're funny the way your family is funny.  The way you take family or friendly information and turn it around, spin it on it's head, give it a sarcastic tone or link it to a historical travesty and spit it back into the air.  My relatives have dry and sarcastic one-liners down to a science.  It's like a racket ball game when we are gathered together. The puns and witty observations fly so fast you’re not sure you can hurl them back, but then, you do, you always do.  And so, I find friends who can play this game, who can come together in one accord on making fun of the world and each other.    Friday night, sitting amongst a group of co-workers for "happy hour" I was anything but happy.  Oh, I was jovial and jokey and witty and brilliant, but somewhere along the line I realized that this wasn't the real funny me.  I had to work hard that night to tone my references down and to pull what little information I knew about these people to the front of my brain.  I've only worked with them for 6 months and this is only the third large group social thing we've done.  There is a few staff I know really well and with them I can joke all day, there is enough reference material there, but when you stick me with a large group of people I only see in the hallways I can't do much.      My jokes on Friday landed on unfertile ground.  There were some hits, but mostly misses.  When you don't know the people well, you're jokes and puns and one liners have to come from outside the group, I usually choose current events, historical events, local events, world events, OK so anything really.  But I'm sad to say I don't think my audience understood my references.  There was a discussion of a painting in the Mexican restaurant, which was of a man holding his own head.  I said I thought it was John The Baptist and then asked whose name was signed.  It was Raphael.  I stated again that I was pretty sure it was John The Baptist.  A co-worker said, "Is it a religious thing?"  "Um," I thought, "I give up."   Then there was my self-deprecating comment when another co-worker asked if I had gone to VCU with him, that I looked like someone in his ethics class.  I stated that I had no ethics, so no, I didn't go to VCU.  He didn’t bowl over with laughter.  "What’s wrong with you?" I thought and then realized I don't really know these people.    Sometimes I don't want to spend all that time it takes to get to know people, I just want it to be immediate.  My cousin's wife was telling me about a dinner party she and 5 other women have every month.  They get together and discuss politics by having various members' research topics then they come together to discuss.  She said she thought of me and that this is something right up my alley.  Well, after tonight and the failed attempts at garnering some sort of recognition for my brilliant repartee, I think she is right.  I need some good conversation, I need some deep thinking, I some cognitive stimulation.

      I went to Carytown today with my brother's little family.  My 6 year-old nephew's artwork was being displayed in a window of a store there, part of a city-wide school art project.  He was 1 of 2 children chosen from his 1st grade class to be placed for all the passersby to see.  It was a great picture full of blue and red and purple and white and yellow.  There was clearly a sky with clouds and then there are 2 distinct sections on the bottom.  One blue square section takes up the majority of the picture with two building shaped things inside.  To the right of the large blue square is a skinny blue rectangle with an American flag in it, just hanging out.   I asked the little artiste what exactly he had painted and he shrugged.  His grandmother said it was a house and then I asked "Well, is it a house that you thought up in your mind or a particular house?"  He said he just thought it up.  "All right, well, good picture little boy."    I then began talking and playing with the little nieces when the artiste's mom states that the two buildings are "Our house and Annie’s apartment building."  I turned my body and swung my head around, "What, my apartment building?"  To which the little one said "Yeah" in his sweet, Well-what-else-could-it-be-? voice.  I looked at the picture again and there it was in all the many colors.  It was clearly a small one-story house sitting beside a 3-story brick apartment building.  How did I not see it before?  I said, "Well, look at that, I'm famous."  And then the love swept over me.  When a 6 year old paints your apartment building into a picture, that is love, real love.  Thank you my little A----baby.  I love you too.

      I believe that dog-earing pages in a book is sac-religious.  I think I may have engaged in this practice when I was 12 for a day or two, but it never stuck.  It seemed too finite a thing to do.  Reading a book is a fluid thing.  Though you stop, put it down, go on about your life and come back to it, the story is fluid, or should be.  So, to me, dog-earing the pages is like telling the pages, even the words to stop going, stop moving because the crease is always there.  It stands as an acknowledgement that someone paused this scene, stopped the monologue, or took a break between chapters.  It will take days of hard pressing to reduce the dog-eared indentation.  For me, the damage is permanent.  Literal and literary disrespect has occurred, something a book can never shake off.  So I use anything I can get my hands on to save my places.  I have bookmarks, but they never seem to find their way into the books.  In bookstore checkout lines I see pretty little bookmarks with clichéd phrases and artsy black and white pictures and salivate.  But my Pavlovian reflexes are always pushed aside because I know that the $3 bookmark will sit in a drawer or beside a stack of books and never actually make it into one.  There is no real reason for this.  When I need to hold my place I franticly search for something flat or something related to the process of reading.  Beside my bed there are a number of books "held" by varying objects.  The most frequently read book has my glasses holding court, the short story book that I dip in and out of is splayed, open side down on a table, a book of memoirs is conversing with my itty bitty book light™, a travel book on London is held in place with the thin, red, satin ribbon attached to it, and another short story book has the receipt for itself tucked inside.   The receipt is my favorite placeholder.  I think this is partly sentimental in that every time I open the book I look at it and remember the store and the circumstances for the purchase.  Partly I'm sure I do this to subconsciously remind myself to get every bit of escapism and pleasure out of the $10.95 I spent on the paperback edition.  And partly because it's convenient and perfect.  A receipt takes up no space between the pages, it doesn't ask you to clip it on, it just slides right in like it was meant to be there and it never leaves a mark.  It's the answer to the damaging dog-ear.  It's the lazy woman’s pause button.  It's quite possibly the very best un-bookmark.  Yesterday I was digging through my assortment of not-yet-read books and discovered an odd bookmark tucked inside Carson McCullers' THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER.  I'm sure at the time, my former therapist's business/ appointment card was the closest thing around when I stopped reading.  I can't imagine that I just randomly put this card in this book.  It was slipped between pages 4 and 5.  A bookmark placed so early in a book would make me think that I never really began reading it.  Maybe I went for a teaser from the first couple of pages.  I have a terrible habit of beginning books and then about 20-50 pages into it, I pick up another book (see the bedside assortment listed above).  This is one of my worst habits and one I really hate. Commitment phobia rears it's ugly head in some many places in my life.  I just can't help but think there is a small, or rather quite large, message in THAT card in THAT book.  Sometimes I wonder...

      I have seasoned chicken in the oven right now.  The smell is amazing and began wafting from the kitchen about 10 minutes after I put it in the 350º box.  The smell is of earthy paprika, pungent garlic, and sweet basil.  It smells like home, like a weekday dinnertime when a family's house is quiet after a day of harried activities and mouths are watering.   My father gave me this container which describes its contents as "The World’s Best Chicken Rub."  He bought it at Food Lion, a place I never go because Ukrop's has spoiled me and I am OK with the overpriced ingredients for my cooking, or lack there of.  I don't even know where a Food Lion is around here.  I'm sure I've passed one on my travels trough town, but I couldn't tell you where.  The seasoning gift was unexpected and handed to me in the Food Lion bag with the receipt still inside.  Two containers where purchased, one for me and for my brothers family.  I think I was the afterthought, but my dear sweet dad didn't want to leave me out.     The seasoning is described as a "rub" and the directions tell you to brush the seasoning mixed with oil and lemon juice over the chicken.  In my kitchen, the brush consists of a plastic bag and there is no lemon juice.  A poor single girl's kitchen is usually devoid of fancy cookery, i.e. brushes or fresh citrus.  I actually do own a cooking brush, however, I believe I bought it at the dollar store and then only in the hopes that I would someday make delicate puff pastries brushed with butter.  I have made none so far.    The brush did make an appearance two weeks ago on Easter weekend when my visiting mother sort of decided I would cook a ham for the family on Saturday night.  I didn't know until I was cooking it that this would be my job.  I've never cooked a ham before.  Luckily, store-bought spiral sliced hams are pre-cooked, you just have to know how to heat them up and glaze them.  The glazing scared me and when I asked my mom how to do this she simply said "brown sugar and mustard."  "OK," I thought "but how the hell much of either one?"  I couldn’t ask her again, she was busy with my little nieces and there was an air of "Have you learned nothing from me?" in her voice.  I looked in the cupboard and found a clump of petrified brown sugar and of course there is always mustard in the fridge.  I remembered that brown sugar comes back to life with heat so I set the stove to high flame, put the brown sugar and a splash of water in a small pot, squirted about 6 seconds worth of mustard and stirred.  The resulting taste test was good; it tasted familiar, like sweet Easter ham.    Two hours into the ham warm-up I pulled it out and brushed on my brown sugary mixture.  The glaze was perfect, sweet and tart and just right for a first time try.  My parents let me keep the leftovers because I'm poor and because they live 3 hours away.  I said thanks, that I'd eat on it all week.  I didn't touch it after they left, despite my glaze of glory.  The first few months I lived on my own with no dining hall or catering company to feed me (college dorms and sorority respectively) I bought more food than 3 people could eat in 2 months almost each week.  I researched and concocted difficult recipes from Martha Stewart and Junior League cookbooks.  I even spent 3 hours on a fancy dinner for a going away party for a friend once.  (I've since learned that friends will come over for your grilled cheese as much for your "whole roasted chicken with goat cheese and sage.")  Now, I've settled into the typical single girl's fridge.  I have a door full of condiments waiting for a salad or bread and meat or even fries, but I have none of those things actually in the fridge to put them upon.   In college, my fridge was stocked for weekends and nights I just didn't want to leave the apartment to go eat with my "sisters."  One roommate and I would try to make what we thought were balanced meals.  We would go grocery shopping and come home to heat up canned beans, boil a bag of rice, and bake chicken with rosemary in tinfoil for 45 mins.  We thought our moms would be proud.  We also bought an entire red velvet cake once and after 2 days gave up the polite slicing and plating to simply spear it with a fork as we stood at the kitchen counter in our pajamas and bare feet and chatted about how we had really sunk to a new low.  During the day today I had a brilliant thought of going to the store after work to pick up a fresh lemon to squeeze in the bag with the chicken and over some freshly cooked rice.  I never made it to the store and the poor herbed chicken has no side dishes, no friends to share the stomach with.  A single girl just doesn't have the time or the energy really for all the fuss, and especially all those dishes.  There will probably be no leftovers either (what with the 1 piece of chicken I fixed), my fridge will go another day (or 10) with not much more than fancy mustard and light Italian dressing.  But, right now my dinner's calling me.

      Miraculously my blessed computer is now typing.  I have no idea why it decided to go bananas and turn the letters "HJKL andM" into "1234 and 5."  I took it to school today and I think maybe my baby didn't like being away from home.  I wasn't that upset as my computer has been showing signs of trouble for a few months and I expect that everyday may be it's last day.  I have an order to send it in to Apple but am terrified that they will wipe out the memory and start over with all the programs.  This makes me want to run away with my sweet sick computer and try to nurse it back to health.  But, I know I can’t do that.  So I'll have to work on saving all my things like my music and documents and pictures.  This is not that hard, just dump it on a disc, but I have a habit of rereading things and going through everything and reminiscing.  What should take me about 2-3 hours will probably take me 2-3 days.  I'm just sentimental like that.    My laptop is my baby.  In fact, that's its name, My Baby.  In the upper right hand corner of my Macintosh G4 Titanium is a tiny replica of my hard drive and the words "My Baby" underneath.  My laptop is one of my best friends.  Not like "Oh I can’t wait to go home and type on my computer."  But kinda.  And no, I'm not a computer nerd.  I use it for writing and Internet and well… music and pictures and to watch movies and a to play a game for about an hour every 6 months or so.  It's like a best friend who enjoys a good flick, listens to my favorite tunes, and doesn't disagree with my neurotic banter, AND travels with me almost everywhere I go.   This current computer is 2 years old, but is still fabulous.  When I bought my G4, my older G3 was only 2 years old and one of my brothers thought that I was crazy to buy another one and asked which one I liked better.  I stated that it was like choosing between two children, it was like Sophie's Choice, the Apple Macintosh version.  If you like Macs then you LOVE them.  There are few Mac people who could go either way, PC or Mac.  I am quite obsessed with my Macs.  I've had 3 so far and used pretty much every version they have come out with.  They are beautiful, efficient, and easy to use machines.  This is the first time I have ever had enough trouble with one that the friendly techies on the Apple help line couldn't solve.  This is the first time they have asked for me to hand over my baby.  I'm scared, but today with the typing fiasco I came to terms with having to let go for bit and let the experts do their thing.  Then I realized that my G3 was still available.  I couldn't wait to get home and dig it out, to feel the tall, black keys under my fingers.  Pressing them is like pressing down on soft dough.  It makes writing fluid and effortless.  I miss that keypad.    When I opened the black chunky laptop I ran my hands over its edges.  The design team at Apple gave the G3 PowerBook curves, like a woman.  The edges are smooth and shapely; the sides of the computer make subtle "S" shapes.  It's high fashion, computer style.  I miss the friendly rainbow Apple at the base of the screen.  It goes to show that Apple did not make a big enough impact on the world market to claim the rainbow Apple without bringing along the rainbow symbol and all of its stereotypes.  Apple now goes for a sleek mono-colored, often white or grey, Apple, a more stylish replacement to its colorful twin.  The rest of my G3 is simple and elegant.  There are no extra buttons to "go straight to the internet," "open you’re email," or anything else that junks up a PC keyboard.  There could be key functions that did those things for me of course, but I get to decide, Apple does not predetermine my preferences.  I think the thing I love most about Apple is the company's adherence and strive for simplicity.  Their computers have clean lines and their mice have one button, not five.  Choices can complicate life.  A simple gift, that is was Apple has given us in its computers.  PC people think that we Mac people are strange.  "The whole world is Windows and you are using a Mac.  You poor deluded youth," someone once told me.  I told him he better step back and then began my rant on why Macs reign supreme.  I was showing someone a keying shortcut on a Mac (like open Apple and s for save) and explaining the ease and simplicity of Macs and she said "Oh, they got those shortcuts from Windows."  I said, "No you didn't" and then explained how Bill Gates just made a PC version of the perfected Mac interface because people were sick of having to remember which drive to boot up and save on.  Deluded youth indeed.  My cousin says she would rather go without a computer than own a PC, which is what she is currently doing.  She gets her Mac on at work.    It's a far better place at the top of world my friends.  Come to the land of milk and Apples, we are a friendly, simple-minded, and visionary bunch.  And remember... as you sulk at us that almost every piece of music or visual media you hear or see has been touched by Apple.    *Anna is OK with being in love with her computer.

      My computer is on the blitz.  When I went to type today this is what I got: 2230234550300 and that was just hitting random letter keys.  Um, OK.  Have to send it off.  I'm scared they will erase it's memory and leave me with a shell of a computer and I will have to start all over.  But, I can't exactly do anything on it unless I develop a code language using 01234 and 5.  But, who has time for that?

      Yesterday I stopped by my nephew's soccer practice just to say hi and show him how much I love him.  He loves to show off, but he also gets frustrated with not being perfect when he kicks the ball.  He's 6.  He has a lot of perfectionist disappointments ahead of him.  While I was there a mother of another child came up to talk to my sister-in-law.  She was asking who was the mother of whom and I said I was just an aunt.  She stated how nice it was that I came out to see my nephew.    During school yesterday a teacher was telling me about a girl who was behaving badly (there is a long story about how bad this teacher is and how she creates the behavior problems in her classroom, but that is for another day).  The teacher was talking about the girl and how she lives with her aunt because her own mother is in jail.  The teacher was trying to point out to the girl that she needed to straighten up because he aunt was good to her even though money was tight in her house.  I hear these stories all the time, an aunt or a grandmother or even a great aunt taking custody kids in their families.  For some reason, yesterday, it hit me that this is wonderful and strange at the same time.  Another little boy told me a few weeks ago with a smile on his face that his daddy was out of jail.  This was a follow up to the statement "my daddy in jail" that preceded a few weeks before.  I often don't know how to react to these statements and they are frequent.   Richmond is a troubled town.  The murder rate here evens out to about 10 murders a month.  That is unbelievable to me.  Crime is so prevalent that it isn't even a frequent topic of conversation.  The newscasters announce the death tolls almost nightly, but my friends and I don't worry because most murders are gang or drug related.  This makes us feel safer, but should it?  I've become desensitized to so much in this town.  I'm not shocked when teachers or kids tell me about people going into or getting out of jail or prison and I'm not surprised by bodies being found behind school buildings or churches being burned down.    I can't help but think that most of my feelings about family members taking on the responsibility of other family members is cultural.  Yesterday, though, I realized when that mother at the soccer field was so impressed that an aunt came out to a soccer practice that I'm so thankful that my nieces and nephew don't live with me.  I can't imagine taking custody of these kids because my brother was in jail (I would of course, but I can't imagine it).  I just can't even fathom it for my family and yet when a child tells me something like this I don't even flinch.  It seems so normal in the schools I teach in.  I realized yesterday that my desensitization is a bad thing.  It causes complacency and this will never help a child.  But, what can I say for Kindergartener whose role models are in jail that will stay with him and keep him off the streets when he grows up?

      This is a quote from a graduate of my college from my graduating year,  "I am about to finish up two year of MBA education at the Wharton School and will start work in September at McKinsey & Co in their Brussels office. Between graduation and starting work I plan to bicycle across the USA in 48 days..."  Our five year reunion is this summer and some people have chosen to update all those who are waiting with bated breath to see what they have been up to over that last five years.  The above update caught my eye because really, as if the Wharton School wasn't enough this guy had to throw in his hot job in Brussels and then of course the side note about the cyclying across the USA, but that wasn't enough, no, then he had to add that he'll do it in 48 days.  Sometimes, I wish I had gone to a podunk small town college where I would send in updates like "I just consolidated my debt and hope to be out of my misery is 5 to 10 years."  And my podunk fellow classmates would think "Wow, I really wish my life were as on track as hers.  I really need to reassess my life and get my goals straight."  OK, well, anyway, I've got to run.  My bicycle needs to ridden, around the block in 48 minutes.  Wahoowah!

      Yesterday, Bunny Day, I was driving out to my sister-in-laws' parents' house for Easter dinner (yeah, we're all close like that) and noticed store after store closed.  Her parents live in the suburbs... (sorry, I just puked) and there is mega store juxtaposed to mega store juxtaposed to posh mall along the way to their house.  This is how it went down inside my head:  "Hmm.  Why is Best Buy closed?  What time is it?  It's only 4pm.  Oh yeah, Easter.  But Best Buy is corrupt and charges restocking fees.  Why are they all of a sudden holy?  More like Best Butt to me.  OK, there are no cars in front of World Market, Home Depot, ah Kroger, there you go guys, sell those hams.  Target is closed.  What the?  McDonald's?  You mean I can't go get a Big Mac cause the Easter Bunny is busy.  What?  Oh, Wal-Mart.  Good, dear sweet heathen Wal-Mart.  Damn, rednecks like to shop on Easter, that parking lot is full.  Is Sam Walton rolling over in his grave?  Nordstrom, good for you.  You show them how to fear God, close you store."  Um, I guess I've never been out on Easter Sunday to realize that we still observe this holiday by barring heathens from their purchases.  I guess I am now a heathen.  Well, good, really, I don't believe in judging people for their religious beliefs anyway so um, a heathen I may be, but I still hang out with non-heathens and other heathens and I love them all.    I think it says a good deal about a company to close on a religious holiday in this country, being that the majority of corporations seem to pray to the God of the U.S. Mint rather than the Almighty.  I didn't even go to church yesterday.  This is the first Easter that I haven't been to church.  I just wasn't down with going to Mass with the rest of my family (the only Catholic is my sister-in-law) cause they don't think I'm Christian enough to drink their wine (Catholics do it right, there is no grape juice up in their joints).  So, I slept and joined the fam. for the important part, the food.  OK, so this is all blasphemous of me to say.  But, I probably would have gone shopping yesterday being none the wiser.  I had no idea we were that pious a nation what with Blue Laws being banished within the last 20 years.  Alright, well, you go people, stand up for something, except of course Kroger and Wal-Mart, you guys keep selling on major holidays cause you never know, I might need to buy some ice or a fishing pole at the last minute.

      This past week was my Spring Break from school and I spent most of it tidying up loose ends and looking for a condo (not successfully).  All in all, not an exciting week considering that this time last year I was getting over my jet lag from London.   Last year that I had a longing to revisit my favorite city in all the world.  After my first tiring and horrendous year of teaching, I was planning on going backpacking through Europe with a girlfriend of mine, but she backed out.  Then, I thought I would spend a summer in London as a reward for getting through the fire, but I failed to ever find out how to rent a flat for a reasonable fee for a few months.  So, two years later, after 9/11 and with a pending war in Iraq, I decided that I would go to London, by myself.  There is a time when you realize waiting around for other people isn't worth it.    Luckily, British Airways had cheap tickets and AAA travel helped secure a great cheap hotel and off I went.  My family was not pleased AT ALL.  My brothers were convinced I would be blown up mid flight, my mother thought I would be killed on the streets, but I (and my therapist) thought why live in fear?  I almost backed out though, because at the time the war in Iraq was only a month old and I did get scared.  But I knew I had to get through the bit of fear for many reasons.  So, here is what got my on the plane; I thought, sure I can stay here and be safe and not take the risk and it will drive me crazy because the plane on which I have a reservation will be flying with or without me so I can be on it and be in London or sit here for a week and wish that I had gotten on it, because after all the worrying it didn't blow up.  So, I got on the plane and I loved every minute of it.    It was wonderful and fabulous and there are not enough cliched things to say.  I saw 4 West End shows and revisited my favorite spots and went to museums and shopped and loved it.  A good many people think that it was ballsy of me to go and to go alone.  I've never had that feeling about that trip.  My parents instilled great traveling skills in me and traveling just feels like breathing sometimes.  I love it and I must do it.  I think I am my best self when I am traveling.  I'm an easy traveler.  I don't stress about what the day will bring or getting through an itinerary because the best things happen when you don't plan.  There are too many stories to back up that statement, but the places and cities at the moment should be the tour guides, not a piece of paper or a set schedule.    I missed the traveling this break.  I had planned to treat Richmond as if I were a tourist this week and go to the historical places and museums that I've been meaning to go to, but the week slipped away from me and now I have a paper due.  Sometimes, the real world is not quite a nice as the magical, mystical, travel filled one inside my head.  Oh well, there are always books to take me there.  I'm currently (and just now) reading CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET by Sophie Kinsella, a British novelist.  I bought the book last year in Harrods of all places because I knew that it was not in the US yet and I enjoy her books.  They are the mindless Chick Lit type that a girl just needs sometimes (don't worry I also bought some Seamus Heaney).  So, I hadn't read it until now because I've been trying to read a little more high-brow (though not much more- maybe just a brow lift).  So, I got it out the other night and read a few chapters each day.  Then, in B&N the other day I saw it is out in hardback as a new release.  Funny, how it's not new to me at all and yet it is new, now.     Last year I took Kinsella's book SHOPOHOLIC TIES THE KNOT to London as I had just begun to read it before the trip.  It's about a girl who loves to shop (obviously) who is British, but lives in NYC, but goes back to England to get married (again, obvious).  I would take it on the Tube to read between stops because I also feel that when traveling, you don't need to always act like a tourist (do what the locals do, read on the Tube).  So, I was on the Circle line train going to Leicester Square by way of Embankment reading and reading and being nonchalant. The funny thing is that I was reading about the main character visiting her friend in London and going out for tea in Sloane Square when the train stopped and the doors opened and I heard the announcement of Sloane Square station.  Sometimes, the universe just aligns.  And, no, I don't believe in that crap, but sometimes... Sloane Square and Sloane Square meet and I just can't compete.

      And by the devil I mean Uncle Sam.  I now have to sell my soul and get a second job.  Turns out, I do owe taxes (see 4/3/2004 post).  I went back today to pick up the papers that had been sent to the processing center and there it was in black and white tiny type "You owe (arrow) {a shitload}."  Thanks Uncle Sam, thanks.  The reason why I owe in the first place is because I tutored some kids with Autism last year.  And, being the honest taxpayer that I am, I reported all income and expenses and now I owe.  That sucks.  Honesty, sometimes, not the best policy for my I-really-want-to-go-shopping-but-now-I-have-to-get-another-job self.  "O where o where has my little life gone?"  Over the hill to "Do you need any help or are you just looking?"  I'm thinking Barnes and Noble again.  I love that place.  OK, so most of me wishes that small independent bookshops were the norm rather than giant corporate monsters, but when I walk in there and there are a million books on any subject and the Starbucks and the prettiness, oh the prettiness of it all.  I love that place.  I have to work there, not because I love it, but because I have to, to pay the damn taxes and thereby accrue more taxes and then next year get another job and, oh god, will the cycle ever end?  Fraid not.

      I hate it when I settle into a quiet night of phone calls to my friends and not one of my dear friends is home.  There is nothing like a warm-hearted answering machine to make a girl feel loved.  I mean my friends are fabulous.  They are kind and funny and fun and far away.  Distance from my good friends hurts sometimes and so when I call them out of an act of loneliness and they are not at home, the loneliness gets deeper.  Their fabulousness outshines my fabulousness to nothing and I go back to what I was doing before the desperate plea for conversation.    Tonight, I got 6 messages and 1 number out of service.  The latter was a friend of a friend that I've been meaning to have over for dinner, but come on people.  Then I think about why I wanted to talk anyway.  So much of the time I am just ranting on in my neurotic self-obsessed way and what is in it for them?  I hope that I am a good friend, but I know that have my bad moments.  One particular friend is excellent at getting me to divulge more and more information.  She is a question asker and she is a lawyer.  She asks for more and more info. to the point that I have to stop myself and say "OK, so what’s up with you?" about 45 mins. into our phone calls.  She is great, but she also feeds my self-obsession.  She's also taught me the act the listening because she does it so well.  Then there is my best friend who's mother is a school counselor, need I say more.  While she herself, doesn't have a degree in counseling, she's actually a science nerd, (you know I love you PK) she is fabulous at her second job.  And she does this for all her friends.  In fact, she is so good she just may pick friends based on their level of neediness. Hmmmmm!   The immediate lonliness was brought on by my re-watching of my "Sex And The City" DVDs.  I just really miss my girlfriends sometimes.  I miss the closeness that women can have in true friendships when you live in close proximity.  My best friend lives across the country and my other dear friends live 2-24 driving hours away.  Oh, the mark of having successful, adventurous, independent women friends!    So, I sit down and write and try to work out whatever brought me to the phone in the first place.  I think about what my friends are doing right now that takes them away from their phones.  Are they out with other friends?  Are they watching a movie?  Are they discussing recently read books?  Are they organizing fundraisers?  Are they laughing?  Are they happy?  I hope they are laughing.  I hope they are happy.  They are my friends and I love them.

      On Monday I started the possibility of the process of buying my own place.  I just met with a realtor, that's all, no paper-signing going on, no commitments, yet.  It's a scary thing this idea of home ownership, signing away your life for 30 years.  It's a good idea, financially, but mentally, is this good for me?    I have a few single girlfriends who have bought places.  Two friends in Richmond bought houses.  I think they have balls.  Not that home ownership is that big of a deal, but a house is a big deal.  I personally can't go that big.  The mowing, the pruning, roof replacement, window washing, it's too much.  I can barely handle keeping my 6-room apartment in orderly shape.  I can just imagine the letters from neighbors that I would get concerning the jungle that would certainly grow outside my home.  So a condo, a condo sounds good to me.  It's like an apartment, but I'd get to paint the walls and a tax deduction.    Condo searching is hard.  While I'm still in the beginning stages, I've already seen 3 in person and a bunch online.  Nothing has caught my eye.  I think I am waiting for the perfect one to just fall into my lap.  I'm picky, but open-minded.  I've told my realtor that I'm interested in city properties and no new construction.  I want an old, lived in, worn and wise place.  My very nice, my age, trying to sell me a place realtor took notes.  I checked for a ring. There was one.  What does it say about me when the men I am not attracted to are married?  Does that mean that somewhere out there there is someone who would love my winning personality and bright smile?  Oh, this is not blog about me wanting a relationship.  This is a blog about me wanting, something, a little more of myself, I guess.  There are friends who say, "You will find him when you least expect it."  A good friend who is getting married this summer tells every single girl who claims they are OK with being single that they should watch what they say because she felt the same way last year and poof she's getting married.  Well, with my relationship phobias, I haven't been expecting it for um, 27 years so, um where is the unexpected?  OK, I'm still not ready for all that commitment, so am I ready to commit to a condo?  We will surely see.

      There is the old cliche that music can change your mood in an instant.  Oftentimes, I am the cliche.  Driving in my car a song on the radio will put in the mood for shopping, reading a book, or dancing within the span of 8 minutes.  The emotional hills and valleys that I go through listening to music come up as quickly as the mileposts on the highway.  On Saturdays, when there is work to be done in my apartment, I open the blinds or windows, turn up the radio on an upbeat (usually hip hop) station and get busy.  Choosing one CD to listen during one period of productive time is more difficult.    I have a habit of listening to an album until it is worn out and tired.  I get a new album and listen to it over and over.  I've been known to put certain songs or even the whole CD on repeat for hours.  Because of this, I know every word to albums of bands like U2, Sarah Mclachlan, James, Harry Connick Jr., Billy Brag and Wilco, Michelle Shocked, David Wilcox, Jimmy Buffet, and show tunes like Les Mis and Phantom.  So much useless information floating around my brain taking up space for real knowledge like whom all of my government representatives are and how they vote in their various arenas.  I know that this mind hoarding of information happens to everybody to some degree, but not only do lyrics hide in my long-term memory, but with those lyrics and melodies are visual, olfactory, and textural memories.  Songs, and especially whole albums can bring back days, events, and sometimes-whole years.  Like James "Laid" CD evokes the memory or Camp Morehead where I was a (non-sailing) counselor for one summer in high school.  I had brought the only CD player for the cabin so I forced the 12-13 year old girls to listen to my brooding British music.  Camp Morehead was dismantled a few years ago and the land sold to people building their dream second homes on the shores of many peoples childhood summers.  I actually hated camp, but every once in a while when I listen to "Laid" I wish for the slow breeze coming off the Bogue Sound and all the little SunFish sailing in the wind.  There is another CD in my collection that I bought in the Dominican Republic on spring break my last year in college.  A resident of the house my friend and I stayed in played a native Dominican's CD everyday so it became the soundtrack to our visit.  The music is poorly produced and there are barking dogs used as part of the beat on one song, but that CD is probably the best souvenir I've ever gotten from a trip.  Sometimes, in summer, I'll put it on in my car; roll all the windows down and just drive, thinking of the Dominican.  There are many more CDs and even more recollections.  And so all these memories attached to my music cause the choosing of music to listen to at a particular time quite difficult.  There are rows and rows of CDs in my collection that I just can't bring myself to play because friends and trips and times in my life are gone and can't be reclaimed.  Nostalgia is sad state for me and one I only visit when I really miss someone or someplace.  And I'm so thankful when sometimes; somehow with new places and good friends I have the opportunity to attach new memories to the music.

      that all the world should be taxed.  And so I went to a local tax place that was giving free tax service to teachers (gotta love those perks).  It took two nights because I had to wait the first night for another customer.  As I waited an older man who is a retired accountant and who's son owns the business began to organize my papers.  He was friendly and we talked for at least an hour.  Of course, he knew a lot about me because my life was displayed in numbers before him, but he also told me about his ex-wife who left him six months ago and all the improvements he had personally done on his house that he is now trying to sell.  While he was very kind and a great listener, this was all too much information, but I listened and nodded because he was helping me with finances.  When I left the first night after getting some of my information entered, I owed a boatload of taxes.  I was not happy and immediately began thinking of second jobs.  Barnes and Noble has been on my list for a while, but do I really want to work for a corporate monster at the lowest level?  OK, I'm a teacher, I really don't have much of a choice.  The next night was more promising, well financially at least.  When I walked in, the older man welcomed me and asked some more questions about my paperwork and then said he found a mistake the previous person had made that would save my taxes and actually grant me a return, a small one, but at least it was on the positive side.  I was ecstatic.  The clouds lifted and I would not have to sell my soul to pay my taxes.  He was quite pleased with himself as well and mentioned that he liked to see me smile more than three times.  I obliged him the smiles because he was, of course, saving my taxpaying ass.  This was a small outfit so all paperwork would be sent to a processing center to be checked and then I would have to come back to pick it up.  When I was ready to leave I went to shake his hand.  He held my hand well after the thank-you-for-your-help handshake and said "The good news is that I get to see you one more time."  I gave a quiet-I-don't-know-what-that-means giggle and turned and walked out.  As I left the store a scary thought went through my head, "Did that old man just hit on me?"  He is not grandfather, really sweet older.  He's the just retired, wife just left me older.  Um, no.  I then began to think back to the conversations we had had over the past two nights.  Did he think there was more than accountant/ taxpayer information being past?    I have come to realize that I am clueless to men's flirting techniques, even when they are obvious.  This usually happens when there is no interest on my part and therefore why would I be looking for signs?  There was once the college friend who all of sudden told me he loved me.  I stopped being friends with him, pronto (I know, I'm a bitch, but he ended up gay so um, I think I was right).  There was a guy at a bar once who told me he had been staring at me and trying to pick me up for 1/2 hour.  I had no idea and I'm glad actually, he ended being quite cute and oh-so strange.  Then there was a guy at weekend long party who followed me around the whole first night until I realized after he told me that I was the kind of girl he wanted to marry that I really needed to just be around my girlfriends.  I hate those clueless girls, the ones who have guys swarming around them while they are supposedly oblivious.  I guess, sometimes we all are That Girl.  Regardless if the old tax-man was getting flirty or not, I can't help but feel that my tax refund is now just dirty money.

      So, the other day I was flipping through my sitemeter stats and noticed that someone came to my blog through google.  I clicked on the link to see what subject they entered to get here.  I like to see what other sites pop up along with mine.  Well, some perv entered "pee together" into the google search engine.  My site came up becuase of my innocent story about my cousin and I when we were little.  I was totally grossed out.  People are disgusting.  I need a shower.

      I just need a hug.  No, no, the biggest hug you have actually.  A giant teddy bear sized hug that envelopes me and cradles me and maybe even rocks me gently back and fourth.  A big hug, that's all.  Well, and maybe the answer to the question of "Why?"

      The work “dork” refers to the male sexual organ, “Geek” was the name of a circus performer who bit the head off of chickens, and “jerk” refers to the jerking motions that a person with severe cognitive or physical disabilities can display when they lose control of their muscles.  Sometimes, the words in our verbal lexicon are no so innocent.  I’m just sayin’.

      “I gotta go,” I squealed.  I was 4 years old, skinny with dark hair, pale skin and big brown eyes.  “I gotta go too,” said B.  She was 5 years old, skinny with blond hair and brown eyes.  We were beautiful together, the little girl version of yin and yang.  “Let’s go together,” one of us said.  So we raced to the upstairs bathroom, got ready and sat down together to pee.  We were giddy.  This was silly.  We were peeing together, our tiny bottoms sharing one toilet.  Our mothers thought it was precious.  This was our cousin thing, a little girl bonding time.  One mother grabbed a camera and flashed our picture, B. with her long blond hair and legs together facing the bathtub, me with my long brown hair and legs together facing the wall.  We are squeezed in, our hands holding on to the tips of the oval seat so we wouldn’t fall in or off.  Our clothes are simple knits, me in white, B. in dark blue; our shorts stuck to our legs have appliqué.  We are gorgeous.  We are smiling.  We are young.  We are silly.  We are happy.  It is one of my favorite pictures, B. and I concocting a simple plan to kill two birds with one stone.  I’m so glad there is a picture of that innocent time.  Sometimes B. and I will talk about our childhoods, how we grew up so differently yet share so much in common.  She is my blond size 2 cousin.  I am not her.  She is a modified hippie.  I am an ex-sorority girl.  Her mom is young and the least neurotic of her sisters.  My mom is not.  But we both have a factor in our blood that causes blood clots.  So do our mothers.  We are so different and so similar.  I am proud of her, that she is a brilliant photographer.  I love that she loves her animals and plants like they are her children.  I’m glad she has found a man in a fairytale way, which we always dreamed would happen.  I love that she is strong and kind and knows more than she tells.  And I love that sometimes she will say, with laughter in her voice, “Anna, we use to pee together!”  “I know,” I say, laughing back, “I know.”

      I  I don’t remember his name, but I remember the first time I met Autism.  I was in college doing a very short practicum.  It was, in fact, my first practicum.  I was placed with a special education teacher at a local elementary school.  Her classroom served kids of varying disabilities, but mostly kids with LD or mild MR. She practiced “inclusion” and this was my first experience with this hot topic in special education.  I observed her sitting at the back of a classroom with a small group of kids while the regular education classroom teacher led a lesson with the rest of the class.  “So this is inclusion,” I thought.  “This isn’t what I had in mind, but I could do this.  OK, I get it.”  But, I would do more than observe over my 3 short visits to that school.  I asked the special education teacher if I could help her.  I wanted to get in there with the kids.  They were, after all, why I was there.  She asked me to sit with a little boy and read with him to keep him occupied for a short while.  His social skills were strange to me.  He came to me when I asked, but never looked at my face.  His eyes darted quickly from on thing to another, mostly at floor or knee level.  He sat down with me on a couch in a corner of the classroom.  He was the first to open the book and he just took off reading before I could tell him what we were going to be doing.  I had no time to ask him about the title, the author, or the pictures.  I was amazed that he could read the book verbatim to me.  He was in 1st or 2nd grade and I knew his true reading skills surpassed his supposed ability.  I asked him questions as we read the story.  I wanted him to explain or expand on the pictures in the book.  His answers were “yes” or “no” if anything.  Mostly he ignored me.  It seemed he had no idea what we had shared together.  I remarked to his teacher later that I was very impressed with his reading, but wondered about why he couldn’t or didn’t answer my questions.  The teacher was busy and couldn’t quench my inquisitions.    I was so uninformed and inexperienced with Autism.  That teacher couldn’t have told me the answer to my questions.  Like Autism itself, the answers were complex.  II Mathew was four years old and on the flyer he had an angelic face with blond ringlets framing big blue eyes.  I answered the ad for a home-based teacher and began doing ABA therapy with Mathew in his home for 6 hrs. a week.  It took me only a few days to fall in love with him.  “This is good work,” I thought.  “This is what I was meant to do.”  I had another job that year in college working in the merchandise department for a famous band.  While I took phone orders and packed t-shirts all I could think about was Mathew and how the work with him was far more important than satisfying the sticker and CD wishes of teenagers.  I was anxious to stop working for the band and when summer ended I split my time between classes and Mathew.  I learned ABA well enough to do it in my sleep.  “What number? What letter?, Good job!, No, try again.” ran through my head, my dreams were flooded with discrete trials.    I worried about Mathew and whether I was really being effective.  I explained to friends and family that my work with Mathew was tedious.  I tried to put what we were doing into everyday language.  I said “We’re trying to introduce him to our world, one thing at a time.”  I don’t think my friends really grasped the idea, their puzzled faces said more than their encouraging words.  They feigned enthusiasm for my sake.  This was becoming my passion.    After a full year with Mathew I was tired of ABA.  Our sessions had become the same, the same drills, and the same goals.  I was bored.  I can’t imagine what Mathew was feeling.  He was making progress, but not enough that I could make sense of it.  I had seen one major improvement in him.  I told my parents one night during dinner on their drive through my college town that Mathew had made gains and I was so excited.  I was seeing that he was understanding what we were teaching him.  The example I gave was this:  Everyday when I see him I say “Hi Mathew,” and he answers “Hi Anna” usually with a flat affect and no eye contact.  I then say, “What are you doing?”  And there is silence.  I prompt him with “I’m sitting, I’m playing Nintendo, I’m reading a book, I’m watching TV, I’m eating…” He repeats my answer and I say “Good job” and we get to work.  We’ve done this a thousand times.  It’s just the way I greet him, nothing specific we are working on.  Then one day around the 7th month into my work with him I walk into his room and say my stock greeting “Hi Mathew.” “Hi Anna,” he says.  “What are you doing?”  “I’m bed,” he says quietly.  I stopped in mid-stride then I flew to him, picked him up, threw him in the air saying, “That’s right, you’re ON THE BED!  Good job!  I love it!”  I tickle him and we repeat the sequence, me shaping his words with a prompt. “I’m ON THE bed.”  This was a good day.  This was important.  He was understanding.  I would later learn in my education classes that Mathew had generalized the information we were teaching him.  He was “getting it,” but I was happy for the reprieve and change of pace that student teaching brought when I had to stop working with Mathew.  I continued to baby-sit and stay close with the family, but this was my last experience with hard-core ABA.  It was the foundation for my obsession with Autism.  It was a good learning experience.  It was important.  III  The first day of my student teaching I knew things would be very different for me.  This was a TEACCH classroom.  What I walked into was a mess, a scattered and colorful maze of bookshelves and desks.  The teacher and TAs were just putting everything together after a summer off.  There was a relaxed feel and yet there was so much to do. The teacher was a graying hippie who wore overalls and Birkenstocks, drove a red pickup truck and talked about her horse, Nelly.  She’d developed the classroom and program with a fellow teacher.  This was her baby.  She knew Autism backwards and forwards.  She was wise.  I knew I’d learn from her.  And I did.  The first day the kids arrived, 8 of them in all, I stood and watched and followed, mostly with my eyes and mouth wide open.  These kids talked in full sentences without prompting, the cared for their own belongings, they followed their own schedules, they played with typical peers, they asked for help, they were toilet trained.  “This is not Autism,” is all I could think.  I talked with the teacher that first school day when all the kids had left.  I had a million questions about each child.  “Why is Ethan so lethargic?  If Sadie didn’t talk when you first met her, how did she learn to talk?  Will Kathleen ever read?”  I knew I had to get used to fact that Mathew was not Autism and Autism was not Mathew.  That classroom proved the spectrum for me in terms of kids, in terms of methodologies.  Autism is a rainbow of colors, I got it.  IV Anthony’s parents came to school before school even began.  We had to amend his IEP.  He was switching schools to my newly formed Autism classroom and he would be held back in kindergarten for one more try.  His mother and father were originally from India.  They spoke English, but I still found myself speaking loudly and repeating things in simple phrases.  I needed to feel that they understood me because I couldn’t understand them.  Anthony’s first day in my classroom for kids with Autism was my first day too.  We both had no idea what we were in for.  Anthony would spend half a day in kindergarten sharing a TA with another student and half a day with me working academics and adaptive skills.  Anthony worked hard and was rewarded with playtime.  He spent a lot of him playtime having figures interact or simply talking gibberish to himself.  He knew English, but would only speak when prompted.  His parent assured us that they only spoke English at home.  This was important for him to learn one language given his challenges.  His parents were adamant and I believed them, they didn’t understand him very much either.  He made no eye contact unless I cupped my hands around his big beautiful brown eyes and put him face to mine.  Anthony was a puzzle and he worried me.  Then, we began to acknowledge his sounds and anytime he used an English word appropriately we threw a small party.  Soon Anthony was throwing his own parties.  He would show us his artwork enthusiastically exclaiming, “Look.  Oh it’s beautiful.  Good job Anthony!”  When he would answer a question he would automatically congratulate himself, “Yes, good job!”  We would agree with him and then laugh with him.  We knew he was repeating us, but we couldn’t have paid for that pride or that growth.  We took it and embraced it, Anthony was awakening.  Slowly and surely Anthony made strides.  He quickly learned to read alongside his peers.  He was counting and making patterns.  His comprehension was always a bit of a challenge, but by 3rd grade he was working on grade level and fully included in his regular education classroom.  He even had friends.  Anthony was an exception.  He was bright and his parents worked with him constantly.  He is only one of many success stories, but his is one I think of often in terms of extremes.  His speech pathologist would often say to me when I was discouraged,  “Anna, when we tried to evaluate him his first year in kindergarten he was a mess.  He would sit in his classroom in the corner, rocking and saying gibberish.”    Turns out, there was no gibberish there, just words that needed shaping and a little boy who needed lots and lots of encouragement and laughter.  We happily gave it to him.   V  Autism is a neurological disorder that stems from deficits in social and communication skills and coincides with repetitive behaviors.  I often speak of Autism’s umbrella, how ADD and OCD and MR can all be part of a child’s diagnosis, but I always feel I fall short when explaining the true nature of the disorder.  This is hard for me because I can’t possibly relay all the stories and images that had led to my understanding and yet without those stories and images my understanding is weak.  I want people to automatically see what I mean when I try to describe how this disorder can present itself and I am so careful that I don’t leave a Rainman image, a one man show of a multi-faced disability.  I think I always fail; Rainman is more visual than my words can ever be.  And this too is what frustrates me when trying to explain my philosophy in educating people with Autism.  Contrary to my beginning with this disorder, I believe in a highly eclectic approach filled with speech therapy, occupational therapy, sensory integration, floortime, inclusion, schedules, behavior plans, varied opportunities, generalization, varied teaching materials and methods, all under a child centered, extremely structured environment.  And above all I believe in spontaneity with these students.  How can you be spontaneous in a highly structured environment?  Easy, make sure the structure allows for freedom and the kids will blossom.

      I see the skyline of New York and my stomach does flips.  I want that city.  I crave that city.  When I unexpectedly come across a picture of New York’s skyline, I take in the scene and then have to look away.  I can’t look too long because the stomach flip will turn into an aching.  So, I move on and begin to plan a trip back to Gotham.   I’ve only visited on short trips.  Sometimes my visits were so brief they were merely a tease.  A one-nighter for a private concert, a one-night lay over to the Dominican, and a lunch on Spring Street in January with snow falling while passing through town.  No matter the time I’ve spent in NYC, the city is always with me.    This past December I told my friend shortly after we emerged from Penn Station that I just felt at home in the city.  There is so much life in New York and this is what I love must about it.  Of course there is life everywhere, but in NYC it is at its most vibrant.  I love that there are people crashing into you on the sidewalks.  I love that you can hear the streets and sirens at 4am on the 25thfloor of an apartment building.  I love the subways and buses carrying strangers to a million different places.  I love that there is a giant patch of green in the middle of the chaos to offer a reprieve and that inside that escape the skyline still impresses its buildings, gesturing to come back into the fray.  I consume as much media related to New York as I can.  I watch every documentary I find, rent movies with that take place in New York, read books with NYC as the setting, and read blogs of NYC dwellers.  Obsession would be a good word for it, but my fascination is more of a hobby.  I think about moving there and then life goes on and I forget about it or convince myself that it’s not really what I want, that I need to cultivate the roots here and stay near my family whom I love.  But, when I see a picture of New York’s skyline, my stomach tells me to go back to the obsessing, to get online and find a job and an apartment in the city, to forget the ties in Virginia and to make that leap.  I know, I know.  Why not?  Well, I have no answer.  All I can say is give me a year, we’ll see.

      the fever is breaking which is a good thing, but i would rather be cold than sweating.  thanks to my friend, j., in texas who urged me to go out and get sick food.  i was so hot, but my belly is full and that is a good thing, however eating salad while breathing through your mouth is a hard thing to do and not choke.  i'm just sayin'.  i'm done with the sick updates, go back to your lives people, i'll be blowing my nose and turning up my AC.

      I hate having a cold, especially when the weather is warm.  My head is clogged and nose is stuffed.  I just want my bed.  HMMMMM, my bed.  Must. Get. To. Bed.  Right after some meetings at school with parents who probably won't show up and I'll just be sitting around twittling my thumbs and wishing for my bed.  2 of my 3 meetings scheduled for this morning already didn't happen.  2 more non-meetings to go, then home and bed and tv and orange juice.

      At one point during every season, save for summer, I think that this season is my favorite time of the year.    I love the point in fall when the leaves have turned their autumnal colors and there is a crispness to the air that only happens in late September and early October.  Fall smells like new backpacks and fresh notebooks.  For me, fall signals beginnings though most of nature is ending or falling into a slumber.   Winter brings the snow that quiets and cleanses everything under its blanket, and this usually brings rest from the harried school days.  I love the cold and chilled air of winter, sleeping under a thickly feathered duvet and throwing on handmade scarves to snuggle my neck.      My favorite thing about spring are the honeysuckle flowers.  Spring sneaks up on me every year.  I grow use to the barren trees of winter and somehow don’t notice the buds and tinges of green that Spring pushes through.  Then one day, all of a sudden, there are no more branches on the trees, hillsides cascade with green, houses are hidden behind rows or clumps of leaves and flowers, and shade gracefully covers the precious areas under the trees' new dress.    But, honeysuckle.  It's an amazing testament of re-growth.  It grows wild along highways, alleys, schoolyards, and backyards, any place with a fence to lend climbing space.  The bushes are everywhere and when a small honeysuckle breeze blows and catches me off guard I am seven again, standing in my front yard on the left side of the house near the alley with my brother and neighborhood friends.  The bushes are full grown and you can't be outside without the sweetness luring you.  We would gather round the bushes picking the yellow and white flowers as quickly as we could.  We wanted as much sweetness as we could get, but we were hindered by our work.  Stealing honeysuckle juice is a delicate task.  You must be careful to pluck the whole flower from the bush.  Then gently holding the flower midway up the petals between two fingers on one hand, you pinch the bottom green mass between two fingers on the other hand and pull.  The pulling must be slow.  You must feel the tiny yellow ball at the end of the delicate stem slipping through the petals, grabbing and pushing the honey out of the small hole you've made in the flower.  Then quickly move the flower and stem to your tongue a moment before you pull the stem from the flower and feel the tiny tickle of sweet, watery honey.  It's spring.  Your tongue has confirmed it.  Life is beginning again.

      I was strolling through B&N one day and noticed that in the SAT prep section there were new materials, which were not part of my SAT study path.  I had a tinge of jealousy seeing "SAT word" novels on the shelf.  The titles like BUSTED and HEAD OVER HEELS accompanied cheesy cover art and promised stories of love and mystery among high school students.  These "novels" are written around common vocab. words found on the SAT and those words even appear in bold type within the text.  I was jealous because even though I have a BA in English Lang. and Lit. and love to read, I hated and struggled with reading throughout elementary, middle and high school.    My majoring in English was a surprise even to myself because I entered college loathing reading and writing.  I even went to the writing center on campus to get assistance with my early college papers and I would come out knowing I had much work ahead of me.  I was originally going to major in Psychology thinking that I needed this background for teaching.  But, my heart was never in Psychology and when one of the best professors I ever had gave me a C, it pushed me to make a change.    He was one of the best professors, not because of his teaching, but because of our talks during my office visits.  I went to him often for help because I was failing his class.  He became my friend and gave me guidance.  I learned about his family and his struggles in college and he helped me see that my world was not, in fact, collapsing around me.  We didn't talk much about the class I was taking from him, these were more like therapy sessions.  The strange thing about his role in my life that semester (and even later when I would go and visit with him) is that his specialty was in learning and cognition and he worked primarily with mice.  He wasn't trained for the sessions we had and when he handed me chemwipes as I cried during my first visit, I knew he would be my friend.    After a few sessions in his office, the semester was ending and it was time for the final exam.  I rocked the socks off of my final, but he still gave me a C for the course, I was one point away from a B- and passing the class.  I was heartbroken and felt betrayed. When I went to see him after winter break to discuss my grade, he didn't flinch although he had previously and quietly said he would help me if I made a good enough grade on the final.  I left his office quietly and quickly that day, there was no therapy session to work me through this one and I wasn't that upset, surprisingly.  He knew what he was doing; he knew my heart was not in Psychology.  With the threat of having to retake that Psychology class to finish the major looming in the distance, I went on with my other classes.  While studying THE EPIC OF GILAMESH for an anthropology class with a friend, I realized I had to change my major.  I loved the analysis of psychology, but I hated the science of it.  English, this is where I could find the analysis I craved without any science to confuse my brain.  I crammed every English class available into my schedule.  I stuck to mostly poetry classes as I thought this was my passion.  I think part of me really liked how short poems where.  I was still a little afraid of all that reading.  But, I couldn't avoid it forever and I'm so glad that I had to read books like A RAISIN IN THE SUN, AS I LAY DYING, DROWN, NATIVE SON, CYMBELINE, THE COLOR PURPLE, and THE BLUEST EYE.    I wasn't the best at reading all the assigned readings.  "Sir Gawain" and Chaucer didn't excite me and there were Colonial American passages that put me to sleep, literally.  I still struggle with my love/ hate relationship with reading.  I wish I were voracious at it.  I think it's partly that it takes time for stories to unfold.  I wish I could finish books in one sitting like a movie, but I read slowly.  I read every word and say each one silently in my head.  I know there are speed-reading methods, but I don't want to skip over words, I just wish I could read every word, faster.    A few years ago, I started a book journal where I write character maps and synopses of the books I read.  It's an idea from my 10th grade English teacher and I find it good for me.  I have physical proof that I've read a book and it jogs my memory if I can't remember a plot line or character details.  In the beginning of the journal I noted words I needed to look up, big words not in my daily vocab.  This lasted for about 3 books (OK just 1 really) and then the words I didn't know disappeared from the entries as if I've mastered the English Lang.  Hardly, I just got lazy, realizing I probably would never use or see those big words again and just began to skim over them.  But, sometimes, I crave bigger words in my head and I wonder if I read "SAT vocab." novels, would I cognize the context clues, ascertain the definitions and ameliorate my conversations?  I doubt it.

      Tonight going to my good friend's house to watch the finale of friends (um finally, thank God) I was driving to the middle of nowhere.  I hate the suburbs and she and her fiance live so far out that it takes 30 minutes and $2.50 in tolls roundtrip from my apartment in town.  So driving, I saw this mini cooper with the license plate "SUVS SUC."  Now, I know we guzzle gas and are ruining the ozone, but I really wanted to pull his little mini ass over and challenge him to play chicken with my SUV.  I'd squash him.  He'd be like a crumple soda can after slamming into my Sport (luxury) Utility (hauling shoes and pretty purses) Vehicle.  So, you mini man, watch who you're picking on.   And my best friend is getting married and sometimes this makes me cry.  Like tonight, it finally hit me and I cried.    PS-  I love mini coopers, being obsessed with all things British.  But, don't mess with my SUV!

      Of course I've thought about it happening.  I've envisioned how it would happen and what I might do.  I've considered that I should devise a plan if it happened, just to be prepared.  Well, it happened and I had no plan, no diagram to show me what to do.    This morning I woke up with a headache thinking, as I do every morning, that I just want to get back in bed, I want to call in sick.  But, I never do call in sick.  I turn on the coffee maker, get dressed, fix lunch and when the coffee is ready I begin sipping it while quietly saying a prayer that my empty stomach will except the legal stimulate and take it straight to my brain.  This morning, the coffee couldn't work fast enough and the headache required 2 ibuprofen.  Praying to the over-the-counter drug gods that the medicine too would go straight to my brain, I began looking for my keys.  I couldn't find them and my head hurt too much to search really hard.  So I grabbed the spare set with it's spare car key, spare car remote clicker thing, and spare apartment key.  The clicker thing was the slightly used one I had traded for the unused one a few months ago thinking that the battery in it had run it’s course.  It's a sad little keychain with only the three danglers, but it would have to do, I was running late.    It was a wet morning and this time I remembered my spare umbrella in case the heaven's opened up on me as I went from school to school.  I stepped out of my apartment, coffee in hand and as I approached my car, the spare clicker wasn't working.  I figured its tiny battery was in fact dead and opened the driver's side door with my key.  I then tried to manually unlock the rear doors by using the power unlock button on the driver side door (I know, not really manually).  Nothing happened.  I was confused.  I hopped in, put my bags on the passenger seat, set my coffee in its holder and put the key in the ignition.  Upon turning it, I got nothing.  I mean nothing, not even the usual piddily sound the altenater makes when it’s trying to charge the battery when in fact the battery is dead.  All signs were pointing to a dead battery, but no noise, that was strange.  I was confused and then remembered how the ignition had been acting funny the last few days.    Here is where I needed the plan and had none.  I first said a quick thank you to God that I was a support teacher and did not have a classroom full of kids waiting on me and then a bit of panic set in.  What do you when you are almost late for work as it is and everyone you know is probably at work already.  I called my brother, he had to take the kids to school and even if he could get me to work I couldn’t travel to my other schools and I'd have to take care of the car today anyway.  So, I had to call in.  I was getting my early morning wish, but really, this was not the way I had wanted it.  Having no plan I couldn’t figure out how to call in: Do I call in sick or is this personal business?  Do I call in for a half day and hope my brain clears and I figure out how to get to school for the last half of the day?  Who can help me?  How long with AAA take?    I ended up calling in for the whole day.  Car troubles have notoriously taken whole days before so I thought I would play it safe and not confuse the day even more by having to try to get to school by a certain time.  It all worked out.  The dealership was able to (expensively) fix everything by the end of the day and I can go to school easily and safely again.  I'm just wondering, do you have a plan if it happens to you?

      This past weekend I went to Winston-Salem, NC to a cousin's wedding, on my dad's side.  I am not close to this side of my family; my dad having only brothers and brothers are less likely to gather their respective families together often enough for children to form bonds.  I do see my cousin A. every Thanksgiving at our house though I don't really know her.  She is, however, sweet and kind and so I was happy to go to her wedding.  I was, however, happier to also spend time with my Cousin Loves A. and R. from my mother's side.  My mother has two sisters and while both live in different cities in North Carolina, all of our families have grown up together.  We have spent almost every holiday together, camping vacations at the beach, and weeks at Lake Norman, NC.  My cousin's and I (a total of 3 girls and 1 boy) haven't always been great friends, but we were great playmates growing up.  We were around each other so much that it seemed like we were brothers and sisters.  We played, we fought, we played again, and then we went to college.  When we grew older we became friends.  Trips to visit each other and weekly phone calls developed.  We became good friends, we were happy our mothers brought us together, we were happy for our Cousin Love.  Cousin Love is how we address each other and we do it with a southern drawl.  It ends up sounding like "cuzzin luuuuv."  It is merely a way to say, "I'm glad you're in my life.  I'm glad you’re my cousin and I love you."    Cousin Loves have begun to multiply.  There are now wives and soon-to-be husbands and I'm sure there will be children soon too.  We welcome the additions and affectionately extend the Cousin Love name.  Our children will continue to be cousins though growing more and more distant in a familial since.  We know they will grow up together, we hope too that they will develop innocent Cousin Love and see the joy of friendship that we have.  We have a tentative plan to save our monies and buy a beach house.  We want to name it Cousin Love, but know that the world would think us odd.  So, in Spanish it would be "Primo Amor."  And in Italian, it also means "first love" and this sounds good to us.  So, this past Friday night, after the rehearsal dinner for A.'s wedding I took my newly found cousin from my father's side over to A. and R.'s house for some quality time.  It was fun, good drinks, good conversation.  It was like we had all been friends forever.  It was what Cousin Love is all about.  And my cousin R. from my dad's side blended right in.  In fact, we've convinced her to come to Thanksgiving this year, to continue and expand the Cousin Love.  The Cousin Love was so good I felt full up, full up of the kind of love that lets your know you have all you need in the world.  The next night at A.'s wedding I sat with my mom and dad, my dad's cousins, one of my dad's brothers, and my cousin R. as we watched A. and B. swish around the room.  They did their prescribed wedding things: the first dance as husband and wife, the father-daughter dance, the cake cutting, and the throwing of the garter.  As I watched them cut the cake I felt full up again.  I felt no envy of A. and B. at that moment.  There was no sense that I was missing something.  I realized then that I love my family, I love my life, and I am happy.  Full up, indeed.

      How do we meet them?  When do we know they will be important in our lives?  What are the signs that certain people are meant to change you, permanently?    This weekend I found a good friend, and luckily, she is part of my family.  At our mutual cousin's wedding we met again after probably 15 years.  I don't even remember the last time I saw her but it was probably at our North Carolina family reunion, eating chicken stew cooked in a large cast iron kettle over an open flame.  Surrounded by family I didn't know very well and in the mist of teenage angst I guess I didn't realize what an amazing person R. would grow to be.  Funnily too, we lived an hour away from each other at one point in college and never made the trip over the mountains to meet.    R. currently lives in NYC pursuing her passion, poetry.  She’s been through college, graduate school and now another masters degree for writing.  She's lived almost a whole life since we last talked and I guess, I have too.  We talked about NYC and my passion for that city and about poetry.  We have more in common than I can believe.  She is someone I wish had always been in my life and she was, I just didn't know it.  The cousin's wedding whom we were celebrating was brought about through similar circumstances.  A. and B. had gone to high school together, but didn't run in the same circles.  They both went on to college and jobs and lived in various other cities then met again a few years ago while both were back in their hometown.  Their friends say that A. and B. are perfect together, they compliment each other, and that they are deeply in love.    Why does it take years, sometimes lifetimes to realize that people who surround you are the ones that will compliment you in ways you can't even fathom?  It is as if we are not ready at times.  Friends, lovers, husbands, and wives may pass us along the street, but until we have fully grown into ourselves, it doesn't matter how often we meet.  When we are ready, hopefully they will be there.  It's as if we are all just ships passing in the night and I'm so thankful when somehow we meet again and our lives begin a new direction.

      My parents are here.  They are taking care of me which is nice since the tetanus shot has ruined my left arm, I got a splinter in my good foot hopping around, and all of my muscles are sore from having to be used all of a sudden in ways they are not used to.  Anyway, enough of the moaning and groaning, I should be half-walking in a few days.    My family is taking me to the beach to be waited on.  I can’t go in the sun with the antibiotics that I’m on and I can’t get my foot wet.  It’s all good; I don’t like the sand and saltwater anyway.  So, I’m off for a week.  I’m being driven 4 hours to sit in a house and have people bring me things.  I’ll be knitting up a storm and reading and watching my little nieces and nephew play.  I wish I could play with them.  So, no blogging for a week.  Come back, I’m sure I’ll have lots to say when I return to you as long as you return to me.

      And it seems I should have stayed there.  The infection is way better today, but I was really groggy from the vicodin this morning.  I had to take it last night to sleep through the pain.  Then, this morning, I went to fix some eggs and toast and just when I was going to put the food on the plate I stepped on a blade that had fallen from a cabinet that I forgot about and didn’t see.  I sliced my foot wide open and now have 6 stitches.  I’ve never had stitches and I was not the best patient for the poor doctor.  This has been a rough two days.  I’m going to bed and please don’t call cause I can't walk to get the phone.

      So, I have an infection and from 6 to 10:45pm was in some SERIOUS pain.  I went to a prompt care place nearby and pretty much cried the whole time as the pain got worse and worse.  I thought about not going, about toughing it out.  I don’t like to look like a hypochondriac, but after phone calls to mom and the worsening of the pain, I couldn’t not go.  I’ve never seen any of the staff before and I went by myself so I’m sure the staff saw this crying girl and was like “Ok, what’s going on there?”  As they sent me from the bathroom to x-ray room to testing room and 2 people walked in on me undressing then dressing, I cried.  I cried around the nurse, the doctor, the x-ray tech.  I winced and moaned and squirmed like I was having a baby.  I’m not a crier and as a woman I can handle pain in the abdominal area pretty well.  I couldn’t stop the tears, the pain was too much.  So, after all the testing (and crying), the doctor on call gave me a bottle of vicodin.  I think he felt sorry for me.  I’ve taken the other meds, but not the vicodin yet.  That powerful a drug scares me.  And, thanks to the beautiful power of antibiotics (we are talkin’ serious ones here) and gentle Tylenol, I can walk and sit without moaning.  I love medicine.  I love doctors.  And, I’m sure if I take the vicodin, I’ll love you too.

      Yesterday, the phone rang while I was brushing my teeth.  Mouth full or foam and sonic still buzzing, I run around looking for my cell phone.  When I locate it deep in the depths of my purse I don’t recognize the number and think that I need to answer it quickly.   And then, like a dumbass, I do.  My muffled “hello” allows the person on the other end to identify himself.  While he does so I’m thinking “What do I do now?  I can’t talk like this.  Do I swallow it (ew) or spit while he’s on the phone.  What. The. Hell?”  I decide on spitting and just confess it, he’s already heard me sound as if I’m under water.  So I say “Hold on, I’m brushing my teeth,” then go to the sink to spit, sonic turned off but still in my hand.  I apologize to him when I return and hope that he didn’t hear me spitting in the sink, 3 feet away from the phone.  I realize; what a dumbass, like answering the phone at that moment was so important that it superseded the mouth full of water and paste.  What, what was I thinking?  Sometimes, I wonder.

      I’ve realized it is real work being a girl.  The maintenance is insane and usually I am not great at making regular appointments for the filing and plucking and cutting and tweezing and polishing.  I usually get things done on a whim or because I can’t take the jungle growing above my eyes anymore.  Home upkeep is far cheaper, but I am far from skilled enough to keep it up.  I try for a few weeks and then I have to revert to the professionals.   I’ve never really been the kind to have one hairdresser that I go to excusively.  A college roommate would travel 45 minutes back home to get her hair done and still goes to the same lady today though now the commute is about an hour or more.  I don’t understand that.  Sure, a good hairstylist is hard to find, but there are several out there, in every city.    I’ve never had a fear of the haircuts either.  I’ve walked into salons for the first time and told the stylist to just do whatever they wanted to do.  Some stylists like this, others, not so much.  I haven’t really ever had a bad experience.  One hairdresser said that I didn’t have to worry about my hair framing my face while other women used their hair to enhance their features and thus the anxiety they have.  I think she was complimenting me.  She also gave me one of the best haircuts and I ended up going back to her a few times.  In the 10 months that I've lived in Richmond I've had my hair cut three times by three different people, none were bad, but none were exceptional either.  Today, my stylist was Daniel, a thin man with spiked dirty blond hair who smelled like cigarettes and herbal shampoo.  I was apprehensive at first for a man to be plucking my eyebrows and cutting my hair and then he spoke and walked.  There is something comforting about a gay man being in charge of your beauty needs.  I told him I just needed a trim and he guided me to a sink then said we’d do the eyebrows first so we went to back room with a comfy bedlike chair.  He worked on my eyebrows longer than most women stylists have.  He plucked the small thin straggling hairs at the top corners of my brows and only put the wax on once.  He massaged the areas wear he had waxed and plucked.  He relaxed me.  He took his time and care.     I was disappointed that he didn’t massage my head when he shampooed my hair.  I expected he was an extended massager, he wasn’t.  As we walked to his styling chair I wanted to tell him to do whatever he wanted with my hair, to put his spin on it.  As he was combing out I my hair, I wanted to tell him to be creative, do what he thought was best for my face.  I never did.  I sat quietly and watched the other customers.  He never asked how much I wanted taken off.  He just took my hair and started cutting.  He cut it to a healthy length, parted it down the middle and added subtle layers.  He did this without asking or telling me.  He cut and cut and cut, the layers taking time and many head tilts.    When he was finished cutting he put straightening cream and hair gel into my wet hair and blew it dry using a rolled brush to straighten and turn the ends under, a skill I can never get down.  He didn’t talk much, nor did I, but when he did he said things like “rock and roll” and “twisted.”  With these words, I realized we couldn’t be friends.    Hours after meeting him, he lingers.  When my hair swishes or I brush it out of my face, I smell him, cigarettes and herbs.  In the time that I walked in looking for a simple trim and walked out with a hairstyle, Daniel became my hairdresser.  I’m committing to him like no other man.  I know at least he will take his time and care and he'll give me what I need without even asking.

      For week’s I have been wondering when exactly Father’s Day is.  I know of course, that it’s in June and on a Sunday.  But I feel like it moves around from year to year.  I have, however, just learned that it’s always the 3rd Sunday of June each year.  Hmm, I really have trouble with dates.  I’m horrible at birthdays.  Actually, horrible is probably not strong enough a word.  My best friend and I will often send birthday cards that are 6 months late.  But, we know that’s the way it is and we accept it, wholeheartedly.  Others, however, are not so kind.  I’ve known people to really get offended by others forgetting their birthdays.  That’s just damn selfish in my opinion.  I don’t know.  I’m not a big birthday celebrator and never really have been.  I’m trying to get better at it, but dates elude me.  Like today, I was reading my daily blogs when   urlLink Jennifer Weiner’s post  mention’s father’s day and I have one of those “Oh my God, I’ve got to call my Dad” moments.  I ran around looking for my cell phone and as I’m talking to my Dad I realize that I have not sent a card or anything.  I quickly realize I will try to remedy the situation next week at family beach week, but still shitty, shitty of me.  I sent my Mom a Mom’s day card (a day late of course), but nothing for my old Dad, who loves me so unconditionally.  Sorry Dad.  It’s not personal, I just suck.  Well, I guess in my case, we’ve established why there is no Daughter’s Day.  On the bright side, maybe the Father’s Day cards will be half-price tomorrow.

      Cellophane.  It’s my new favorite wrapping material.  I’ve just wrapped 2 presents for today’s scheduled parties and yes, one is wedding related and yes, I’m over it.  As I went through my quite vast assortment of wrapping material I landed on the cellophane for the first package because I had to due to it’s odd shape and then I just had to us the cellophane again for the next one, it’s just too fun.  And, while wrapping, I walked around singing “Cellophane, Mister cellophane” from Chicago.  And now, I’m just chillin’ before I have to leave to drive all over Virginia in one day.  I’m usually a last minute shopper and would typically be out buying the presents right now. But, I’ve learned to stockpile presents so that I can just pull from the bunch and go.  But, my last minuteness is not totally gone, I’m really waiting on my clothes in the dryer and I was suppose to leave like 5 minutes ago.  Oh well, people love me anyway, despite all the lateness and last minute presents, tags still on.  I am, in fact, not Miss Cellophane cause you gotta notice the girl who is fashionably late.

      Last night, at about 9:30 I had the bright idea of going to see “Raising Helen.”  Some friends had already seen it and since I had no work the next day I could handle to the late night showing at 9:55.  So, I hopped in the car and raced to the West End to the stadium seats.  It was me, and three couples.  Wonderful, nothing like smug couples on a Thursday night date.  Whatever.  I took my own row, settled in and put my feet up.  I love the movies.  I started going to movies alone about 5 years ago when in college an impossibly popular co-worker divulged her love of going to movies on her own.  I was appalled and shocked.  Why in the hell would a 20 year-old, blond, size 2, charming, and smart girl ever go to the movies by herself?  She explained that her mother did it and that she liked it.  She would often be shopping and find a movie on and just go.  I thought she was brave.   It took me a good year before I braved the movies alone.  It must have been uneventful, as I don’t even remember the movie that ended my solo movie going virginity.  Now, I don’t even think twice about it and yet I think I’m still a bit of a rebel in the venture.  I don’t think my friends do this.  I even have a friend who doesn’t like to rent movies alone. Movie watching is a solitary act anyway, unless, of course, you are at home snuggled up on a couch.  So, if a movie is out that I want to see and no one else does, or I’m near a movie theatre and see something interesting, or I’m bored at home and need to do something other than stare at myself, I’ll go to a movie, alone.  No big deal, it just happens.  So, last night was “Raising Helen.”    Sad bit of a movie if you ask me.  The plot was weak and lame and not well thought out.  There were scenes were I literally wanted to rewind and rewrite and then there were the ever present continuity issues where the clothes in one scene are the same in the next scene although it’s a different day.  This movie overall has bad writing, bad editing, and not really great acting although I still adore Kate Hudson, John Corbett, and Joan Cusak.  What were they thinking?  Anyway, good premise, just not well done.  And, I’m beginning to rethink things about my friends who said it was “so cute.”     And then, because I could, I went Wal-marting at midnight.  I stepped into the Wal-mart at 12:15am and spent the next 45 minutes shopping the supper center.  It was fabulous and surreal.   Tons of people were about, mostly Wal-mart workers restocking the shelves and a few customers.  There were boxes everywhere, which you had to navigate around.   The restockers would sometimes give me weird glances like it was crazy that I was bargain shopping in the middle of the night on a Thursday.  Please, like it’s not weird that you are working at Wal-mart in the middle of the night.  Yarn was had because well, the kitting has not stopped.  And then, because I could, I got some fresh produce and checked out at 1am.  Wonder if that is what Sam Walton envisioned for his supper store?

      So, I went to the doctor yesterday to get a mole checked out.  Since I had blistering sunburn 10 years ago, I have been cautious with suspicious items on my skin.  Turns out that melanoma does not necessarily strike the area that was burned (interesting).  And the mole or whatever seems to be nothing (thank God).  This was my first visit to this doctor in Richmond so I had to fill out all the info. sheets and sign away my life, literally.  Well, since it was the last day of school I had a little trouble leaving when I wanted to and then when I got to the hospital there was an unexpected game of chicken for the limited parking spaces.  So, I finally grab one and walk quickly through the soupy, muggy air (wearing jeans no less) and make it to the fourth floor about 7 minutes late for the appointment.  I get my papers and sit down.  I write and write and then pause to actually read the clauses before I sign them when the receptionist moves the glass plate that blocks out the waiting area (um, it’s glass people, we can still see and hear you) and this is what she says “Miss Banana, the nurse is waiting for you because she was expecting you at 3:30.  Can you write faster because you’re late?”  “Yeah, OK,” I say.  And then it dawns on me that I should have stood up on a chair or something and announced to the waiting area “Hi, my name is Anna and I’ll be late today.”

      I woke up early this morning to a fog, a thick fog over the city.  It nestled in the trees in the courtyard of my apartment building.  It was tranquil and quieted the morning like a blanket of snow.  I haven't seen a fog in years, probably becuase I sleep through them.  But today, the fog  mimiced the fog I've been under for the last few days.  Not a bad fog, just a mindless, in a daze fog where I leave important, confidential documents on a copier, don't put an important piece of info. into folders, can't comprehend questions asked of me, can't understand what I am reading. I've been in a haze but, now, it's mid-day and the fog is gone, the sun has burned it away.  It's the last day for teachers, my files are completed, I've helped other teachers clean up their rooms and mail letters home.  School is out.  We're done.  One year down, a million more to go.  But, for now, for the summer, I'm free.  Plans for the beach, LA, and NYC are being made, and of course all the weddings.  Happiness abounds with the sunshine raining down.  Pool days and sleeping in and reading books and unexpected trips and movies and relaxation and freedom.  It's good to be a teacher when it's summer in the city.

      And by that I mean Knitters Anonymous because I am addicted.  I decided to pick up knitting again this weekend and have so far knitted 2 scarves and begun three more.  I'm obsessed.  I even raced after school to a knitting store that closes at four so that I could buy way too much yarn for half price.  But, at least my friends will nice have nice yarn in their scarves instead of the Walmart brands.  I want to constantly be knitting.  I've even started knitting in bed with no lights on.  That's right, knitting in the dark, sexy.  And yesterday, I had to refrain from taking the knitting to the bathroom with me.  Knitting is on the brain so much that it's all I think about (at least for the last few days).  Like, when I'm at work or out with friends I keep thining "I really wish I had my knitting right now.  I really want to finish that scarf."  It's like I need a bumper sticker that says I'D RATHER BE KNITTING.  And no, there is no purling, just kniting and knitting and knitting.  See the obsession, it's bad and well, I need to get back to the needles and the yarn.   Tonight was yet another wedding related event, a surprise semi-shower for the friend and co-teacher.  Enough with the wedding stuff already.  The showers and the bachelorette parties and the girl's weekends and the weddings.  I mean there is no money left, the well is dry.  I'm really going to be weddinged out by November.  "Dear Lord, make me a bird so I can fly far far away.  Dear Lord, make me a bird so I can fly far far away."  Or maybe, I'll just bring my knitting and then it will all be bareable.

      Woke up around 11:30 which really not that late, but considering it was drunk sleep, it was far to early.  Too much bachelorette partying.  My head hurt and I felt like a ton of bricks hit me so back to bed I went at 2 pm for a long nap.  I don't even know how I got that drunk or if I was that drunk.  I didn't drink that much, although people were handing us shots all night, but those fruity shots don't have much alcohol in them.  And, I had my wits about me at the end of the night.  I was probbably the most sobber one there.  So, what the hell with the hangover?  Anyway, it's currently 5pm and I need to get on with my day, or what's left of it.

      It’s summer, well almost and not officially, but heat wise; it is summer in the city.  Poor Virginia, it is plagued with humidity and hot summers.  I know our summers are not like Texas summers or Louisiana summers, but they are hot enough for me.  I don’t believe in snootiness, but sometimes I wish I were a person who “summers” somewhere else if just to get away from the nastiness.  Maine, Maine sounds good, or maybe even Canada.    The only thing really good about the heat is that pools open and there are trips to natural bodies of water.  Every year my family takes a beach trip. I actually hate sand and saltwater, but I love the laziness of a beach week.  I take about ten books and I just read and play with children and read some more.  And then there is, of course, the eating of the shrimp and crab.  There is always the eating of the shrimp and crab.  But, before and after the beach, there is the pool.  Growing up we belonged to our local Elks Club, an organization I really don’t understand except that there were usually old men there at any given time throughout the day and they could be found at the bar inside the clubhouse.  I’ve never found out what the organization stood for or against and as soon as the last child (me) went to college, my father’s membership ran out.  We used the place for the pool and the pool only.  The local pool, a place where you learn to swim from the coolest man you have ever seen because he wears sunglasses underwater, where you strengthen friendships over adult swim breaks and during “shark” in the deep end, and where you tackle the fear of the “high dive.”  I never joined the swim team, but I was a lifeguard for 2 summers.  Lifeguarding is the best job ever invented.  Sometimes I think about going back to lifeguarding with my summers off, but then I think that the current 16 year olds would find me a bit strange and I would certainly not fit into their lifeguarding clique.  That’s OK.  I got my lifeguarding kicks back in the day anyway.  I just really miss the twirling, the twirling of the whistle while sitting in the tall chair with a high vantage point, the sun so strong you can see your legs tanning before you eyes.  The pool is now what I go to with my nieces and nephew.  None know how to swim yet, but I am determined to solve that one.  My favorite thing to do with them is to take each one, individually, in my arms and pull them across the pool from the shallow to the deep end.  On the cross-pool treks, our faces close together, we pretend different things, sometimes they practice kicking or just floating.  When water rushes into their mouth and nose I know it’s a 50/50 chance of them quitting the trek mid-pool.  But, the other day, my precious niece coughed it out and swallowed hard then said, in three year-old voice, “Annie, I want to ride the waves again.”  You see, we were pretending to be on the ocean and waves were gently bouncing us up and down (hence the water in the nose from the crashing wave).  I love the pool.  I love that it turns a three year-old into a chlorine swallowing wave rider.

      There is this guy I know, but he shall remain nameless, although I might be related to him.  I adore this guy.  He is one of the funniest people I know and whenever I am around him I know that we will be laughing so hard that we fall over.  However, last night I discovered he is the biggest dork I know.  And this is why.    We both love Apple.  We are both obsessed with Apple.  Like last week I emailed him about the new  urlLink Apple Airport Express  and he emails me back and is like “I was reading about it just when you emailed.”  And then the next day he calls me and we chat for like half an hour about how the world really needs to know that Apple is so superior and really people would be happier if they just owned an Apple and businesses were run on Apples.  We discover it is a futile attempt, but our love for Apple will never die.  This guy is a certified Windows programmer and even interviewed for a job at Microsoft so his love for Apple is even more special than mine.  He converted about 4 years ago and has not looked back since.  In fact, he’s a little pissed at people who like PCs.  He loves Apple so much that he gets magazines about Apple and somehow is in the loop of rumors about the new products they are creating. I know there are rumor websites and he probably surfs them.  It’s all a business related obsession since he programs all day. I have to confess that if I understood all that computer jargon, I would be in on it too.  I just don’t have time to learn all that stuff about computers, I just know I love Apple.  I also know that he is my Apple lovin' hero and he is there to dispense knowledge should I have a technical quetions.  He rocks my Apple lovin' world.    Well, so last night he was telling me about the last issue of  urlLink Mac World .    urlLink Alton Brown gave an interview and developed a special recipe to celebrate Apple.  The name of the dish is APPLE MACaroni and Cheese.  “Ew,” he said.  “Yeah, weird,” I said.  Then, this guy that I adore,went on to tell me that at the last Mac Expo (or whatever) when Steve Jobs gave his closing statement, he had a friend over to his house during their lunch hour and they watched it on the internet while eating MACaroni and then for dessert they had APPLEsauce.  Oh, dear one, I still, still, adore the hell out of you!

      Ronald Regan's body will be lying in state on Thursday at the capitol in DC.  I’m thinking about going.  Although I don’t really have the money to spend on gas, when will I ever get to see a president lying in state in the near future?  And really it’s not about the pomp and circumstance, it’s about Ronnie.    He’s the only president I feel personally connected to and it’s not about his politics or his cuddly nature and love for his wife or that even a president can be human and have family problems too.  It’s about birthdays.  You see, ole Ronnie and I have the same birthday.  Big deal you say, you also share it with Bob Marley.  But, Bob didn’t send me a birthday letter when he was president.  Ronnie did.  It was 1988, I was eleven and this was the last year for Reagan in the White House.  I thought my sharing his birthday was the coolest thing.  I had no idea what his politics where nor did I care.  I considered myself a Republican then because my parents were Republicans and so this extra kinship with Ronnie felt strong.    My mom had the brilliant idea of sending him a birthday card and announcing the importance of the shared date.  I was a little apprehensive, how exactly do you tell a stranger, much less a president, that you have the same birthday?  Why would he even care?  Well, we bought a card and wrote a note.  I’m sure my mom helped craft the sentence or else it would have been something like “I was born on Feb. 6 too.  Happy Birthday Mr. President.”   And, well, that’s probably what it did say.  So, off went the card and about 3 weeks later arrived a letter from the White House.  It was the most exciting day of my eleven year-old life.  My family was thrilled too.  I learned of his death on Saturday night after a full day spent with old college friends.  A friend was looking at the now framed letter on my living room wall and said that Reagan had died today.  “What?” I thought.  Then I thought about peace and that it seemed so expected and so natural.  I’ve dealt with Alzheimer's in my family and it is trying disease, on everyone.  I told my friends that it was probably for the best for him and his family.  Then I went to the letter.  He, or a staff writer, wrote a short and sweet letter.  It is typed on a typewriter.  The date is off-center from the letterhead and the eagle emblem.  It begins by acknowledging our “mutual birthday.”  Then, in presidential fashion, goes into the history of Febuuary birthdays including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.  He tells me to study these great men and hopes they will inspire me the way they have inspired him.  The letter ends with Mrs. Raegan joining him in his wishes and may God bless me. His name is signed simply “Ronald Reagan,” no mention of president anywhere.    We think he really signed it.  It doesn’t seem to be a stamp.  I will probably never truly know. But, it doesn’t matter.  My eleven year-old heart knows he touched this letter somehow.  In the bottom left hand corner is my full name and childhood address.  My name has a typo.  Since the beginning of the letter I have gone from Anna to Anny.  At eleven, this typo crushed me.  Now, it is endearing.  It makes the whole letter so much more real, so much like the man who’s birthday I share.     Dear President Reagan,  I am honored to have shared your birthday.  Every February 6 I will continue to remember your birthday and those of the other great presidents you mentioned.  Washington and Lincoln were truly amazing, but they don’t mean as much to me.  I can’t look over at my wall and see their handwriting.  I loved your letter and will always cherish it.   May you and your family find the peace you deserve and thank you, from my eleven year-old self and from me now, for all you did for our world.  					Sincerely, 					Anny

      J. is a “military brat.”  She’s been all over the country and Germany, her family moving from place to place every few years.  Somehow she has roots in the mid-west and Virginia.  I’m thankful for those Virginia roots, happy they brought her friendship to my door, literally.  Ohio claimed her during undergrad.  She was a Buckeye.  I guess she still is.  I’d like to think she is more a Wahoo, but it’s not my choice who wins out.  The Buckeyes could probably kick our Wahoo’s football ass any day.  J. now lives in Austin and owns a home there.  Her settlement came by way of Miami and Seattle, her traveling childhood brought to the surface in young professionalhood.  She’s an audiologist.  I think she is resilient.  She lived 3 doors down from me in one of Thomas Jefferson’s original rooms at his University.  We had fireplaces, wood floors, a sink inside a closet, and a bathroom we had to walk outside to use.  Not exactly an outhouse, but close enough.  We were in grad. school, but J. was only there for one semester.  We spent hours chatting in our rooms, at night walking from room to room in our pajamas, outside.  When she left it was winter and cold, the freezing temps. had been lifted by fires in our fireplaces.  Our individual rooms heated the old fashion way.  J. was the best at making a fire that didn’t smoke the room out.    I was sad to see her go and begged her to stay, to change her practicum placement to Virginia, not Kentucky.  But her plans were made far before any of us moved to the Range.  So she left but came back for Foxfields and a New Year’s party in a cabin in the woods.  J. is a good friend.  She is smart, logical, sensible and yet just as neurotic as I am (well maybe not).  We talk about how much our lives have mirrored each other’s while she moved from state to state or country to country and I lived in the same pink bedroom for 18 years.    I’m so glad she stayed for that last semester.  I’m so glad she couldn’t find an apartment or dorm room for those few months.  I’m so glad we are friends.  And I love her couch or air mattress in her tiny cross-country apartments.  She’s an anchor in my life, a friend who will always be there and never feel that far away no matter the actual distance.

       Restaurants are closing or are closed by now.  It’s late, but you’re hungry.  You’re not sure you want to cook, but you really want a salad.  Drive to Ukrop’s on your way home.  Rifle through your dashboard CDs looking for Emmylou Harris.  You need Emmylou’s mellow voice to match your mellow mood.  She’s not there, but you’re happy you find Johnathan Rice.  Put it in the CD slot.  The volume is louder than you expect but you don’t change it realizing “Quiet Hushed Voices” is what you were really craving.  Sing along to it with the sunroof open.  Don’t mind the people in the parking lot looking at you with bass flowing out the open windows.  Keep singing the words.  Park, knowing you are only pausing the moment.  Enter the automatic doors.  Pick up romaine lettuce and chevre.  A salmon fillet is a sudden passing desire; you grab it, and hummus, for snacking.  Check yourself out in the self-serve lane.  Get back in the car.  Turn the key and hit the sunroof button.  Keep the duet with Johnathan going.  Feel your brother’s bass in the floorboards and through the speakers in the door.  This is good music.  Know that you can’t go home.  You want to drive and listen and feel the wind.  There are no mountains here, no country roads just 5 minutes away.  There is the highway.  Head toward home, but pass it.  Make the right hand turn you make every morning on the way to work.  Bare left this time.  Take the toll road, the Downtown Expressway.  You need a hit from the city buildings; the skyline up close and 50¢ is worth it.  Pass Rosewood and the U of R Stadium.  Put Johnathan on repeat.  Slow at the toll booth until the SmartTag signals a green light to keep going.  Speed up, a horse out of the gate.  Get the center lane.  Pass VCU and the Cherry St. overpass.  Pass the 2nd St. exit and Thomas Jefferson’s Capitol building.  Go under a quarter mile of overpasses with lights burning a fluorescent tunnel.  Emerge to the buildings of downtown Richmond.  Wonder why so many lights are on.  Follow the signs to 95 North and 64 West, Washington and Charlottesville.  Curve around on the highway bridge through low buildings.  Look out the window, to the left, at the taller lit buildings.  {I want to love this city.}  Be amazed that you are driving so close to the bricks and concrete.  See the clock tower of the renovated Main St. train station on the right side, you can almost touch it.  Sing with Johnathan.  Get off at the Broad St. exit.  Go quickly through Shockoe Bottom.  Remember the recent attacks here.  Get back to 95 going South this time to Petersburg.  Stay in the right hand lane, curve right at exit 73C toward the Powhite.  Imagine you are not driving but are suspended, floating through these buildings, under the highway above you.  Look through the windows of La Difference.  Wish you understood the difference.  Go back through the tunnel of lights.  Pass the Jefferson Hotel and the Governor’s Mansion.  {I want to love this city’s history.}  Pass the exit for the Boulevard.  Quell the wish to live there in an apartment alongside Virginia’s museums and with a balcony.  Go on to Cary St.  Go to your home.  Park and walk to your building.  With the full moon behind say quietly and to no one "I want to love this city."  Unlock you door.  Put down your bags.  Wash you hands.  Decide it’s too late for salmon.  Get a large bowl out.  Pour the salad into it.  Begin to toast pecans from the freezer.  Crumble the chevre over the lettuce.  Pour on your homemade balsamic dressing.  Add the toasted pecans.  Take a bite as you walk to the living room, to your computer.  Realize you are a good cook, that this salad should be on menus.  Sit down at your laptop.  Put Johnathan on again.  Listen to him, and write this.

      Rrrrrrrring Me:  Hello. Them: (silence) Me:  Hello Them:  Yes, is this Mrs. So and So Me:  Yes* Them:  Hi Mrs. So and So.  I’m calling for the Richmond Fraternal Order of Police Me:  Hello.  I’m sorry,  did you think I was home?  I’m actually not able to answer your call right now.  Gotcha!  Ha Ha!  Please leave a message, unless this is a computer operated telemarketer in which case do not ever call me again or I will BITE YOU.  If this is the Richmond Fraternal Order of Police then also do not call me again unless you have actually done something about the 10 murders that happen each month in our fair city, especially those that happen around the schools I teach in.  When I feel good and safe about driving to the schools I teach in, those schools which sadly produce men that will kill others on the same streets, I’ll answer you’re call.  And listen, we’re working on educating kids that don’t kill.  We’re trying.  I’m not so sure about your fraternal orderness.  So, until that time, Stop. Calling. Me.**  *I’m thinking, “I’m not a Mrs. which means you are a telemarketer asshole cause no one else calls me Mrs.” **What I really said was, “I’ve asked you five times to stop calling me, especially early in the morning and especially on Sundays.”  This was followed by an abrupt click.    Sometimes, I wish I was a quicker with the unsolicited phone call comebacks.

      I’m sitting at the Getty along a path to the side of one of the buildings.  I’m in the shade and leaning against the structure’s massive stonewall.  I’m on a pathway to a terrace though it’s a path that is almost hidden.  People have to navigate around me as they walk through.  I wish they’d go away and leave this public space private, for me only.  I can see a vast view of LA from where I sit from the hills to the oceans.  Ahead and slightly to the right is a small clump of tall buildings that make up downtown.  Beverly Hills is just below me.  There is a fire billowing on a mountain a few miles away.  It’s in Santa Clarita a passerby says.  The smoke won’t reach LA because the winds blow toward the east, toward the mountains.  It looks both ominous and soft, like a cloud.  To the left and over the hills from the Getty is the Valley and Pasadena, though I can’t see them I know they are there with clichéd houses and perfect lawns.  There is smog that hangs in the air between the landscape and the sky, a visible reminder of this cities population.  To my right, if I careen around I can see the sea and Catalina Island poking its head just above the haze.  The 405 are below me and the traffic crawls from north and south.  Planes line up in the sky ahead, waiting to land at LAX.  This city is huge, a massive gallimaufry of rich and poor, everyday and famous.  The rich build houses on the mountains or even cliffs, ignoring the impending possibility of earthquakes.  They look like cracker or thin wafers that could tumble down like rocks sliding.  California has it’s own style to everything, but the houses in LA interest me the most.  Their style is a mix of Mediterranean, Spanish, and American classic.  The rich, modern houses are minimalist with hard lines and lots of glass, but mostly there is stucco, tan and smooth.  It is the red brick of southern California.    The Getty is an amazing place.  , a free art museum, open to the public.  But, people don’t usually come for the art; they come to see the Getty.  It is a vast structure of buildings placed on a hillside overlooking all this city has to offer.  It is made of an off-white stone creating straight lines and curved walls.  The landscaping is immense, green, and perfect.  Fountains pop up in many places, an offering of serenity.  The buildings are so large that looking back on them from on of the many terraces and seeing people walking around on the balconies and inside through the glass, they look like tiny bugs, like insignificant, unimportant things.  People stand against the railings where I sit.  They squint and point trying to comprehend what they see.  The wind is strong at times on this hill.  They sun beats down an arid hotness, but in the shade of the building, a chill awaits.

      Happy Birthday A.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What to say about A.?  Only she will know what the title of this post means.  She is a dear college friend whom I lived with for 4 years, 4 crazy party filled and chilled out years.  When I first met her I didn’t think I liked her because she is so honest that it can be abrupt at times.  Then, her roommate went home for an extended time due to illness and A. and I became good friends and I saw her kinder, gentler side.  I ended up staying in her roommates bed quite often because my roommate was a freak of nature and I just needed to get away even if it was across the hall.  I’m so glad we became friends and that she is in my life.    A.  is the kind of friend who is there for you no matter what.  She’ll be there to help you move in to your new apartment or celebrate you graduation a year after she celebrated her own.  She is honest and doesn’t judge.  When confronted with people who are quite strange she says, “it takes all kinds to make the world go round.”  We use to rag her in college because the words “my mommy says” preceded almost every piece of factual or advice laden talk.  Well, her mommy did a great job.  She is a great girl and a good friend.    She married a few years ago.  He is a boy who counteracts all that we college friends thought she was.  He is country and mild mannered and loves hunting and listens to country music and watches racing.  A. was a bit wild in college so when we found out her choice we were a little confused.  It turns out that the domesticated life filled with good cooking and family all around is really her true self.  Her in-laws love her as much as we do and she has found a niche for herself and her husband.  They are beginning to build a house on 20 acres of land in the country soon.  I tell her that as soon as she puts a pool in I’ll be there.  I bow to A. and P. land on this auspicious day and bid you a good one.  May tiny pictures from walmart decorate the halls.   Happy Birthday,    ~ Azafata.

      Ahh, little Elizabeth Bishop was so right.  So, I've lost my keys.  They are in North Carolina.  I am not.  I didn't realize I didn't have them until I awoke from the early morning drive back to my parents' house.  Many phone calls later, they are hopefully being fedexed to me and will arrive Tuesday sometime.  I'm trapped at my parents' house which isn't bad except when you want to be in your home, you want to be in your home.  And I, want to be in my home.  Say some prayers people, may fedex not lose THAT package.  I've never lost my keys before and really it's not a huge deal though it may look like (WRITE it) like disaster.

      The LA chronicles are not over, but I have been busy washing clothes, making gifts, and repacking for another weekend of wedding festivities.  So, I’ll be away from bloggerland for another few days.  In the meantime go to my little blogchild’s site.  Yes, yes, Anna has a child, in bloggerland that is.  Go, read, comment.  urlLink  WahooBuckeye   needs you.

      with another city.  I never thought I would like Los Angeles.  Never.  I thought I was an East Coast girl through and through.  Turns out, I could go either way.  Los Angeles isn’t anything I thought it would be.  It wasn’t as flashy as I had imagined.  It didn’t seemed as pretentious as it looks on TV and there was no preparing me for the weather.  LA was amazing and good to me.    I tend to fall in love with most cities that I visit.  Maybe it’s because travel is a carefree existence or maybe it’s because each city beckons to a different part of me.  Why did I fall in love with LA?  Well, it isn’t the rat race it seems to be or maybe I never came in contact with part of it.  And the sun shines everyday.  There are never clouds in the sky or rainy, mucky days (there are also not stars).  I knew this about LA, but I didn’t believe it.  My clouded East Coast brain couldn’t fathom endless days of pure sunshine.  How could you be sad in a place like this because whatever happens, at least it’s a beautiful day.    My love for LA is fleeting, though.  I know when I am home I’ll settle back into the humidity and heat and then the cool air of fall and the snow of winter.  I would miss the seasons if I lived here.  Endless days of sitting by the pool would begin to disorient me.  Life here would be like an endless vacation.  It would be like play, like pretend, just beyond the touch of reality.  And my love for LA is not true because it is shared with my love for London, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Morehead City.  LA is just another city to add to the list of places I could live if I ever decided to pack up and leave the state and family I know so well.  I never do make plans to move to the cities I love so much because I think if I lived there the magic would begin to disappear after a time and I don’t want that to happen.  I’d rather hold these cities in my heart as perfect gems nestled on hillsides or islands or by the sea, covered in fog or basking in sunlight.

      I’m off to LA for fun in the sun with my best friend.  It’s the last of a girl’s romp before she (you guessed it) gets married.  I plan to do some touristy things and then just hang with my best gal pal.  I miss her and I’ll miss her even more when she gets hitched because girlfriends change ever so slightly when marriage happens.  I was hoping we’d hop over to Vegas for the weekend, but we’ve opted for time in LA with her fiancé.  Well, I love them both, loads and loads.  I’m excited to see them, either in a flashy city or just in their living room.  Have to say though, kinda wish I was going to see a booby show.  I’ll blog at ya next week.  Blogger back ya’ll.

      We at mind the gap are a happy and loving lot.  We like diversity and we like to celebrate with our friends when they have things to celebrate.  Today is such a day!  Today is Bastille Day in France, a day of celebrating the end of monarchal rule.  And so, in honor of our French friends, a list of things we love from France, or things that France pimped out to us.  • the Statue of Liberty  • le baguette (yummy) • the colors of the French flag  • fashion  • le croissant (even yummier)  • Dijon mustard • Champagne  • Cannes Film Festival • toy dogs (because the French took them everywhere long before Paris Hilton was born) • Jaques Costeau • Les Mis (though in French it would be lost on me) • Jean-Marc Gaspard Itard and the wild boy of Aveyron • Matisse, Degas, La Tour, Cezanne, Monet, Rodin, Renior, to name a few • Joan of Arc • “Let them eat cake.”  This list does not endorse the loving of all things French because those French bastards didn’t go to Iraq with us so we said the hell with you too.  Our amazing and welcoming country forgot that French troops helped us in the American Revolution and about the gift that France once bestowed on us, the Statue of Liberty, and said, "We’ll call French fries, Freedom fries instead," ignoring the fact that French fries are actually from Belgium.  “Ha, take that you French bastards,” our government said.  Well, those French bastards were pretty spot on and had a sense that Bush was blowin’ smoke about weapons of mass of nothin’.  Damn those French bastards!  Happy Bastille Day everyone!

      The Shakers say it is a gift to be simple and a gift to be free.  “Simple Gifts” is an old shaker song written in 1848 and it is one of my favorites.  It is a song about simplicity, but it also says that “when we find ourselves in the place just right, we will be in the house of love and delight.”  While the house of love and delight sounds like a cheesy, incense burning, hippy joint, the sentiment is what gets me.  I like the idea that when we are true to ourselves we will find the simplicity of life which ultimately brings peace.    But it’s not always so such a simple gift.  We are all given gifts to some degree.  We are can run companies, we can cook amazing food, we can play an instrument, we can balance budgets, we grow a garden, we can teach someone to read, we can diagnosis symptoms, we can write, we can act, or we can see the world differently through the lens of a camera.  We all have talents and gifts which should be a part of our everyday lives.  The act of doing what you are good at, what you are talented in, is itself simplicity and freedom.    My cousin B. is an amazing photographer.  She has an eye like no one I’ve seen.  She loves taking pictures of things like rust and wood.  She can take scenery and portraits, but these are not her specialty.  Those shots are easy and generic, anyone can do them.  The passion she sees through her lens are things we would easily pass over.  B. hones in on the things that we feel corrode of corrupt surfaces.  Somehow, B. finds the beauty in them and she shows rust and corrosion as art.  And she does it so well.     She has never sold a photograph and has pretty much stopped taking pictures creatively when she left college.  All because the cost of taking and developing pictures is too much for her budget.  I’m saddened by this and I tell her often that she has to start taking pictures again, that she has to use her gift.  It is a gift to be simple and a gift to be free and sometimes we have to fight to use those gifts.  If our favorite writers and actors and doctors and teachers didn’t use their gifts, where would we be?  How many times has your life been changed by someone else’s gift?  I know that B. is scared and I understand it.  Putting your creative self out for the world to reject is a terrifying thing.  But that simple Shaker song says that  “When true simplicity is gain'd, To bow and to bend we shan't be asham'd, To turn, turn will be our delight, Till by turning, turning we come round right”  So bow and bend B., simply use your gift, you’ll turn round right.

      Numero dos is done.  Two weddings down, three to go.   The other day I received yet another wedding invitation.  As I perused the oh so familiar oversized envelope I wondered, “Who the hell is getting married now?”  I thought I was aware of all the weddings for this season.  Apparently now, but I was relieved to find out it is a second cousin.  I’m not close to her, so the pain of another wedding was lessened at bit.  It would actually be fine if I didn’t make it to this one.  But, it is in Florida in September.  Either that would be a great time to get a last minute tan or to see the wrath of a fabulous hurricane since it is the beginning of that season.  I don’t know if I’ll go.  It would really be a weekend of hanging out with the rents which, let’s face it, I do enough of in my own apartment when they decide to come visit, often.  I am; however, quite happy for this cousin as it is her second time of engagement though the first for actual invitations.  She’s in her late thirties and that alone gives me a bit of hope and room to breathe.  Tonight was a great wedding.  The drinks flowed and good food was served and we ate dinner overlooking a lake at sunset.  There were people I’ve never seen before and familiar faces from all the showers and pre-parties.  There were good friends and new friends and family.  And there was dancing and pictures and smiling and happiness and love, lots of love all around.   Starting at 3pm in a Catholic Church, I nestled in to back row pew and beckoned friends to follow suit.  Our row, full of teachers, was the official peanut gallery.  We could hear and eye everything from out backseats, the late comers, the whispers, the crying children, the brat child telling her mother to “shush,” we saw it all and yet WE kept quiet.     Not being Catholic, we were worried that this would be what my Dad likes to call and “aerobics class” service.  You know, up down, up down, kneel, up down, kneel, etc.  But, my good friend L. and C. decided on a Catholic light service since they too are Catholic light, if anything. The wedding was short and pretty with well-chosen songs and readings. The parish was beautiful.  I always love big, cathedral parishes; they almost make me want to be Catholic.      I go to so many weddings that I could probably recite the scriptures and the vows by heart, but this wedding did not bore me and when L. walked down the isle with tears in her eyes I kinda welled up myself.  I’m not a crier at weddings.  In fact, I thought for a long time that I had a stone heart because of my lack of crying at weddings.  Everyone else gets caught of in the emotions and you see women dabbing their eyes and bridesmaids pulling Kleenex wrapped about their bouquets.  I’ve never needed a Kleenex at a wedding and have always though “Yeah, it’s a wedding, what’s the fuss, why are you crying?”  But, today, for L., I understood a little more.  She’s almost 31 and the tears in her eyes were the symbols of her waiting so long for that man who loves and respects her and that she in turn loves and respects.  He’s not a perfect man, but he is one with whom she can share a life and so she cried for all that she is getting as she walked toward him.  And when I saw her crying, walking with her father, I thought of myself and if I ever find that man I’m sure then that my stone heart will certainly melt and tears will run down my face as I walk toward him too.    Cheers to L. and C., may you live happily ever after!

      So I haven’t been great at blogging lately, especially since I returned from vacation.  I even wrote those beach ones on vacation when I was up late at night and bored.  But, now back at home there are things to distract me.  I should be writing all day since I have no job, but I picked up a few kids to consult on and tutor so that takes up a few hours a week and then well, today, I’m just procrastinating.  I have my final paper due for a class that finished on Tuesday night.  The paper was actually due Tuesday, but she gave us an extension and I took it.  I am the worst procrastinator.  I will put things off until it is 2 hours to deadline, but this stress is really what gets my creativity and productivity going.  I’ve tried to be diligent and work on things early and it is so lackluster that it seems a waste of time.  I’ve tried to put my own deadlines on things to make me work on it and then go play, but no, again, I don’t fall for my own tricks.  So, today, I probably should have turned it in sometime this morning, but she didn’t give us a time and so I haven’t started.  But, now, now I’m getting ready to start.  It should only take two hours or so, unless I read some blogs, or turn on the TV, or have to call that friend back, or have to find that CD that’s been missing for 3 months because only THAT CD will make me productive.  Anyway, off to work on it, *wink*.

      I met him two weeks ago before I went to the beach.  I’ve been thinking about him ever since and am so happy when I see him.  He lights up my face and makes me feel like I have the best life in the world.  He is amazing.  I’ve even met his family and they are amazing.  He has a brother and sister and his dad his handsome and his mother is kind.  They are calm and centered and welcoming.  On Monday, his mother gave me five ears of corn, just because.    This boy is undescribable.  It doesn’t matter what I write because you can’t possibly get the full scope of him.  He has wisps of blond hair and blue eyes and when he says my name I melt.  His personality shines even when he is in a different room.  He is sweet and cuddly and playful and so much fun.  And the reason that he lights up my day and makes me want to appreciate everything that I have is because he can’t walk because of a tumor on his spine and he has cancer and Downs Syndrome and he’s four years old.  He deserves to live until he is 80 years old with a life filled with happiness and productivity and good people all around him.  He deserves so much this little one, this boy that I met.

      Morehead City, NC.  On the Bogue Sound.  When you hit Morehead City limits you know you are at the beach.  Windows are being rolled down and the warm, musty salt air begins to hit your face.  Your hair begins to curl almost instantly.  You know good grits are on their way too because beach water makes the best grits.  You cross the bridge over the Bogue Sound and see a glimpse of that magical water, part lake, part ocean, part river, all saltwater and controlled by the tides.  There are clams and oysters and sand dollars and porpoises in this water too and you wish you were staying on the sound.  At the light after the bridge you take a right toward pine knoll shores, just a few miles away from Atlantic Beach, from you childhood.    The house sits in front of the ocean, facing what seems to be an endless amount of water.  You can’t believe there is actually something beyond the point that your eye can’t see.  The horizon is so far away that you see whole clouds from top to bottom in the distance.  Some nights, there are storms at sea, you see the lightning, but the rain and thunder never make it to shore.  You wonder what good a storm at sea does, were any boats caught in it?    Some days the wind is so strong on the beach that you have to stay in or go to the inlet or to Fort Macon or a day trip to Beaufort.  Some days there is no wind and the heat comes off the sand like it is willing you to leave.  Some days the rain comes in at lunchtime and moves you from your saltwater post.  Everyday, you want more, more sand clinging to your toes, more saltwater up your nose.  The ocean pummels and turns you out.  You keep going back to it.  In low tide there are tidal pools a short distance from the dune.  These are your favorite. There is enough seawater to float you on a raft and as the tide is leaving there are enough waves to keep you moving.  The tidal pool is the best of all worlds, no thought of a rip current and all the luxury of   On calm nights the moon glows in the sky so bright that the reflection off the water mimics daytime.  You swear you could see by it.  You know that nighttime is the best time on the beach.  The beach is yours then because no else ventures to the beach at night.  You sit on the deck and look at the horizon or the shape of the moon.  You feel like you have a secret that no one else really wants to know about.  How could anyone not love the beach more at night?  You don’t understand the fascination with the daytime, the sun and the rain, when the nighttime brings the moon and crabs and loggerhead turtles.  You know the secret and though you try to share it, others prefer sleep.     Soon you must leave the crystal coast of North Carolina.  No other beaches in the world will compare.  There is simplicity and elegance in North Carolina’s crystal coast.  There are very few trappings of fancy dwellings or pools seamlessly flowing into the ocean.  There are just beach houses, many are old, and some are new or just well kept.  But the house isn’t important, it’s the beach the matters.  It’s the weather and the sand and the promise of good shell hunts.  It’s suntans and bathing suits and rinsing off before you come inside.  It’s a morning swim then lunch then back again then dinner out.  It’s beach towels draped over the deck at the end of the day.  It’s the day’s catch on the pier or at the surf.  It’s floppy hats and sun visors and sunscreen and big umbrellas.  It’s rafts and buckets and shovels and sandcastles.  It’s enduring the grit of the sand and the stickiness of the water.  It’s the oldies station on the radio and it’s your family all around.  It’s the beach in North Carolina and part of you doesn’t ever want to leave.

      A rental for a week for your family, but a house to someone else.  The evidence of the family who owns the house is all around.  The selection of beach reads on the bookcase in the hall, a small sampling of games with missing pieces in the living room, pictures of the grandpa who worked his whole life to buy the house, artwork from local artists, and the choice of curtains that don’t match the furniture.  You enter a rental house like you enter a hotel.  You know it is not yours yet you will treat it is such for the next week all the while ever thinking about the family who calls it “our beach house.”    There have been houses that don’t lock things away.  The fishing pole of the grandpa who bought the house when he retired hangs on the wall beckoning you to use it.  So, you’re father does and on the first cast into the ocean he breaks it.  It’s too bad the original grandfather is dead or your father would have apologized to him.  Your whole family is a bit embarrassed, but your mother’s friend who rented the house said we were free to use the poles so your guilt is lessened a bit.  Still, too bad about ole granddad.  There are the houses that seem to want to share the experience with you.  They leave out a guest book and brochures about the area.  You glance at them.  There have been visitors from as far away as Ohio or as close by as New Bern.  Your brother calls the travelers from New Jersey and New York Yankees.  You call them Yankees too, but not out loud.  They tell stories of their weeks, how much their family loved the house, the good weather they were fortunate to have, and they note their favorite restaurants.  You wonder why they choose to write what they write.  The guest book is quaint, but you are happiest about the tide chart on the bulletin board, now you can start your vacation.    Exploring the house, you can’t believe that people share their space so openly with others that they will never meet.  The coffeepot and spoons and beds and pillows and sinks and bathtubs and deck chairs and lamps are all communal property.  There are fragile things about and when your niece knocks over a lamp and it shatters feel sorry for the family again, but then you think that the owner’s expect these things; beach houses are for children too.  You wonder how all the house was stocked.  Did the owner’s really like the dark, dense fabric on the overstuffed couches or was the whole ensemble on sale?  Did they pick up the appliances at a thrift store or are the leftovers from the family 1970s orange kitchen?  Your family discusses the flaws in the house, in the decorations.  They have ideas on how to make it better, what to paint or how to arrange the furniture.  You are quick to remind them that it is better than any of their beach houses.  Oh yeah, they don’t have beach houses.  No one is amused.    Some houses have a washer and dryer and this is a luxury.  You do a million loads in one week, more than if you were at home and partly just because you can.  You go home with clean clothes; this you realize is quite nice.  Other houses have a linen service and beds are made for you and towels are provided.  You feel a bit pampered by this, but you’d rather have the washer and dryer back.      There are houses with air conditioning so strong you end up with a stuffy nose going from hot to cold to hot to cold.  There are houses where your family breaks the AC and has to have the unit replaced midweek.  You are again a bit embarrassed, but realize you are just helping with the maintenance of the place.  Then there are houses with no air conditioning at all, just ceiling fans and the hope of good ocean breezes.  These are your favorites.  These remind you of camping in childhood.  This is what the beach feels like to you, heat cut by cool breezes off the water.  Days when there is no breeze you thank God for the invention of ceiling fans.  It takes a good day to get use to the heat and the breeze, but when you do, you don’t ever want air conditioning at the beach again.  You sleep in little clothing and one sheet, you like the simplicity of this type of house.    In your mind you are always building the perfect beach house.  It is oceanfront with enough bedrooms to house you immediate and extended family.  It is not new, it is old and well worn, and there is a lot of wood.  The oceanfront deck is partly covered and partly open to the elements.  There are rocking chairs and a hammock.  There is a table for eating and playing cards.  A walk stretches to the dune where just before the stairs begin there is another small deck with seats built in and a shower hose for rinsing off.  The house has most of its bedrooms on the first floor.  Upstairs, at ocean view and deck level, there is a family room and kitchen and dining room in one space.  There are many large windows.  The dining room table is big enough to sit 12 and there are folding tables for extra company.  You want your whole family here and you create a space that allows for it.  Couches in the living room turn into beds.  There is a good stereo with speakers throughout the house and the deck.  Oldies beach music is always on.  Every bedroom has a well-made ceiling fan and can be closed off to the rest of the house so that windows can be opened at night.  There are beach chairs on the deck and in the garage, waiting for the sand.  They are wooden with cloth backs.  There are rafts and lifejackets and paddleball sets and kites and bachi ball.  The house is always full of people.

      They wake up early in the morning to play together.  They are little girls with smocked dresses and bows in their hair.  They run around with high-pitched voices learning to share the toys they have brought, to the beach, to a family vacation.    Little girl cousins are a special thing.  They are automatic playmates and best friends.  They share genes and are beginning to share their lives, their growing up.  They clamor to the beach with all their might, they play in the sand for hours, filling buckets, dragging water from the surf, and hunting for shells.  They are adorable in their bathing suits and their skin tans easily even through super strength sun block.  Their fathers or mothers take them into the water and hold them safely from the waves.  The tidal pools are a perfect depth.  Rafts are their best toys, but sometimes it is just their hands and the sand and saltwater.  They get dirtier than they have ever been and never seem to notice the grittiness, the stickiness.  They don’t want to go into the house even after hours of playing, but they love to rinse off with the hose, a semi grown up shower for a little girl.    Watching your nieces you relive your cousin time at the beach, at Salter Path Family campground, on the Bogue Sound.  Your playground was the sound and your favorite things were floating on a raft on the calm water and clam digging.  You and your cousins where obsessed with shells.  You hunted them tirelessly throughout the days on the beach or at the inlet at the north end of the island.  At the end of the shell hunts, you surveyed your treasurer.  You memorized the shapes and names, the olives and whale eyes and baby cradles and cigarettes.  It is years later that you realize, browsing through shell books that some names were made up by your mothers, sisters.  The next morning, you woke up early to set up shop.  You took boxes your mothers had packed in, turned them upside down, and laid old towels on top.  You set out your shells by the side of the road in the campground.  You sold seashells by the sound.  You were thrilled with every purchase.  After a few days of selling, you and your cousins and mothers would walk the path of the campground to the real shell shop near the main road.  You were amazed with the polished shells.  You bought cleaned sand dollars and gold-rimmed hermit crab shells and rope bracelets.    Your cousin still loves shells and houses them in glass jars in her home.  You don’t need them around you anymore, but when you see shells or revisit the beach or see little girl cousins playing, you wish for the days at Salter Path, for the shelling and sound.  You wish for you cousins and you hope the new cousins will long for their beach days and each other when they are older.

      -tutor precious cancer boy -workout -lunch -clean car, take it to be vacuumed, use oxyclean to scrub stains from coffee spills, organize all the teaching supplies and put in the way back so as not to encroach upon passengers in the back or front passengers seat any longer -organize office so that there is actually a desk to use as a desk -wash clothes so that you can even walk into the office -setup airport so that I am not confined to my living room anymore -dust and vacuum because the dust bunnies are breeding, fiercely  -write thank you notes to R and B, and B because I stayed at their house and/ or received a gift from them like 3 months ago (or longer) -make CD for K and J because they rock and they need the “I’ve Come Along Way” by Michelle Shocked running through their heads as they drive around L.A and also feel my pain -wrap wedding presents for L and for S because L is already a Mrs. and I need to give S’s present to my parents this weekend -email about bach. party for K because invites need to go out soon and we don’t even know what city it’s going to be in (I suck as MOH, aka Maid of freakingHonor) -somewhere along the line, when I can’t take the stench anymore, take a shower  As you can see, a busy day ahead.  Let’s just see how much actually gets done.  And no, I have nothing else in my head to write about.  Sorry.

      “ urlLink Stuart Weitzman  .  OhMyGod we have to go in.  They’re having a sale.”  I say to K.    Poor K has no idea what or who Stuart Weitzman is. “Sure,” she says and we enter.  The store on Rodeo is small yet two salespeople greet us at the door.  They actually talk to us and welcome us and tell us about the sale.  We have just come out of Ralph Lauren across the street where I found, but did not buy, a pair of purple leather mules on sale for half price at $495.  I knew Stuart could be much more affordable in department stores, but I expect the Rodeo store to have sales where shoes were still $200- $300.  I am wrong.  Every shoe on the sales rack is $75.  “Hot damn,” I think “I just might buy something on Rodeo Drive, baby.”    K and I try on several pairs.  I find some fabulous black satin high heels with an impossibly cute bow covering the toe.  K finds some strappy white heels that she considers for her wedding day.  We each buy nothing, coming back to the reality that even at $75 a pair; we don’t live a Stuart Weitzman life.  We leave, the salespeople shockingly bidding us a good day.  We are tired by this 2nd hour on Rodeo.  We have seen José Eber outside his salon, a woman clutching her toy dog in  urlLink Chanel , huge canary diamonds at  urlLink Van Cleef & Arpels , a rail thin blond model standing as a bored yet beautiful greeter at  urlLink Dior , and the back, private entrances to  urlLink Armani  and  urlLink Gucci .  We are heading toward the car, parked in the sun in a free space in front of someone’s small bungalow and perfectly manicured green lawn.  I am thirsty, having downed my bottle of water noisily in Gucci while walking among the fur trimmed dog beds covered in Gs.    We think we were done with the pseudo shopping and the mouth gaping staring and then all of sudden we walk across Plexiglas ovals in the sidewalk.  Below the “windows” were human size ant holes with manikins ironing or just posing.  There are three of them, two girls, one boy.  “What the hell,” I think.  K and I look above us and there is no sign, just a massive metallic rectangle as big as a Mack truck above us.  People are milling about in the opening to this, store?  The entrance is set back and it is all open, there are no doors, but there are two huge human sculptures with no heads resting just under the ceiling.  They seem to be holding up the second floor yet they don’t quite touch it.  K and I walk in, we don’t know what else to do, we are transfixed.     Inside there are concrete walls and before us a massive staircase that spans across the room leaving narrow “halls” along either side.  We walked down the left side and set into the wall there seems to be a concierge of sorts, a young brunette manning a phone.  “Is this a hotel?” I think.  Just past the concierge’s window there are low tables and set into the concrete walls are lit shelves at hip level.  Things are strewn about.  Bags, shoes, just stuff covering everything, but with no sense of order.  I look closely at one of the bags and see the distinguishable triangle with the word PRADA.  I turn, “K, we’re in  urlLink Prada ,” I gasp, my face looking quizzical and amazed at the same time.  K doesn’t say anything.  We keep walking.  We come around to the back of the room and there is another set of stairs mirroring the ones in the front yet opposite so that the staircases make a large triangle in the room.  We decide to go up, but have to navigate around shoes and the legs of manikins with no torso.  “What the hell,” keeps running through my brain.     At the top of the stairs we turn left and enter a room that runs like small hallways just above the space below so that on the right and left are narrow halls and in the front and back are slightly wider rooms over the stairs.  The walls are green and look like swiss cheese.  But, there are no smooth surfaces on the walls.  There are only holes.  I don’t understand it and I follow K’s hand to the wall.  It’s plastic, green plastic swiss cheese, “What the hell?”    The rooms are created with the swiss cheese walls on one side and glass on the other to keep you from falling down the stairs.  There are metal racks of clothes along the swiss cheese walls with exactly 5 items on each.  Thin, tan, bleach highlighted men in black walk around carrying an item or two.  They are barely noticeable in this room, the fade, into the…air.  When we turn the corner and hit the larger front room I spy the dressing rooms on the right side, above the stairs, I see two little girls playing inside, through the glass.  I think, “I know Prada is weird, but who tries on clothes behind glass, in front of strangers?”  Then, one of the girls hits something on the wall and the glass goes frosted.  “What.  The.  Hell?”    After I touch some $1500 mini skirts, we leave.  K and I don’t understand what we have just seen.  Was it real?  It will be the topic of many conversations with K’s fiancé that week and it will be the first story I tell friends when they ask about L.A.  I’ll say, “I’m going to tell you about Prada, but you won’t understand.”  And when I’m done telling them about the swiss cheese walls and the frosted glass they’ll say things like “Weird,” or “Are you kidding?”  And I’ll tell them that “yes, it sounds weird, but you still don’t understand.  You really have to go.  You have to experience it.  Go to Prada on Rodeo.  It’s worth the plane ride.”

      I used to collect quotations.  I’d culled them from quotation books or magazines or friends or even the daily email from Oprah’s website.  I’d write them in a flowery printed journal in my best handwriting.  I wanted to the believe the lines like “Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow,”  but, Helen Keller never saw a shadow though she lived within one.  I wanted her words to show my how to not only look at the sunshine, but surpass it and become it.  She did, why couldn’t I?    For years my favorite quote was “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.”  When I found it I thought Oscar Wilde was my soul mate, that he understood my plight.  I even wrote it in fancy scrawl across a painted wooden board that held a curtain rod and hung it over 2 different bedroom windows.  But, looking at the stars does nothing for trying to reach them and if you don’t come out in the daylight, the gutter must be a hot and miserable place.  “You must do the thing you think you cannot do,” wrote Eleanor Roosevelt and she was right.  You must in fact do the thing you think you cannot do.  She was strong and brave and I trusted her words.  She was the original Nike slogan, “Just do it.”  These words pulled me through many papers and exams in college, but nothing, nothing in college or life could prepare me for what lay ahead.  My first years teaching I was energetic and naïve and ready to take on the world.  I loved what I did and felt absolutely called to do it.  I thought that my teaching kids with autism was who I was.  I thought it defined me and that everyone should revere me for the work I did.  Those first years threw me into a tailspin of hatred and anger and bitterness and disappointment and fear and illness.  I complained constantly and to anyone who would listen, but friendships and life were slipping away.  Quotations and words of wisdom wouldn’t pull me through and there were many nights I just cried and prayed.    I finally sought help and through a counselor learned that my life was full of unhealthy patterns and that I was the only one in control of what could happen in my life.  I didn’t believe her and for 3 years cried and complained about all the things that happened TO me.  Then I began to use her advice and let the control go.  I had to learn to let go and forgive.  I had to learn to let life take me where it would.  I had to learn to do the thing I thought I could not do.  I faced the shadows and the gutters and I’m still learning to leave them where they are, in the past.  You can’t see the sunshine or stars clearly until you face their opposites.  And no one and no quotation will help you truly get there.  They can point the way, but you, you have to do the digging and nail biting eye to eye combat with all the bad things before you finally appreciate all the good ones and let happiness if not land, at least aim, at your doorstep, everyday.
