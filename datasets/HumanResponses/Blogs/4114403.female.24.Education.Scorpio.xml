         I get so frustrated some days. It's funny because on the days I don't want anything to happen...something comes up, and I have to rearrange my life to fit whatever it is. Then, on the days I long for something....there's nothing. Welcome to adulthood, right?             I'm so tired. People wear me down....I end up saying yes when I want to say no. I don't trust anyone anymore. They all have agendas and intentions....they gossip and lie. They say they love you when they don't. People don't think before they act. They never think of the consequences...the people they hurt....the way they affect the world.      It's kind of disgusting.           I know not everyone is bad. But, I think some days, it's hard to see past that and look on the positive side.  You let someone into your life, and they slam the door the second you think they're trustworthy. They abandon you. Once again....the story of my life.         So, I guess the question for myself is why I constantly open myself back up to that hurt after years and years of people abusing me in one form or another.         I am a loyal to a fault. In fact, I am willing to let people walk all over me. I let them take advantage of me...and when I speak up...they laugh, like it's so cute that I'm standing up for myself.      I am so loyal and friendly, that I've let people lure me into a false sense of security. And then, right when I don't expect it....they drop whatever it is on me. They steal from me physically and emotionally. They try to hurt my self-esteem or they outright lie to me.           I have had very few true friends in my life. I've had even fewer true love's. Actually...just one...and so far, he's never ever let me down. Thank God for that....because he is my anchor. And, sometimes I'm so stupid...I don't deserve him....            Somehow I'm going to have to take a look at myself and figure out what part of my personality doesn't get it. What part of me keeps trying when obviously nothing is going to change? Which part of my brain tells me to keep talking to someone who obviously hates you...why do I bother them and think they want to be my friend....? What's even more stupid is that I don't really even want to have contact with them. I just want to forget and not be angry anymore....     What part of me is willing to give and give and give until I can't anymore. What part of me wants to keep doing for others until I can't possibly do anymore.....?          The only thing that keeps me from being hurt is to learn a lesson and hold it close to my heart. To hold grudges and hate. I am not that kind of person....no matter how hard I try to be. I am not capable.      There's got to be an answer somewhere......

         What paradise have you lost....?         When you're young...people tell you to enjoy your youth. You're supposed to treasure it...immerse yourself in it. That is my lost paradise. I grew up too fast.  I can't remember when or where I lost my youth. I just know that at some point, I began to feel old. In my rush to get to adulthood, I forgot about doing the things kids are supposed to do. Or, maybe my parents scared me so much that I chose not to...I don't know.  Getting pregnant and married at 19 is something that makes a person miss out on a lot. I didn't think I'd miss it. But, seeing Jonathan with his college friends, and hearing their stories...it makes me yearn for that time. I passed it up without a care, and I regret that. I wish I'd dated more....that I'd learned more.... I wish I'd savored it and wasn't so eager to leave it all behind.  It's hard to see myself as my real age anymore. It's so easy to feel like I'm 45 instead of 24...almost 25. I noticed gray hairs sprouting up...they're so wiry and funny looking...very noticable on my head of pretty brown hair. It reminds me of what I'd done wrong...the pissed away years...the things I regret.  On the other hand, it makes me see how much I've changed...how much I've grown. The independence I've discovered within myself is worth the gray hairs some days...it's worth the stress of keeping up with the things I love so dearly.  Perhaps youth is something that one finds again later on. Perhaps we live vicariously through our children...no matter how much we tell ourselves not to. Or, perhaps we're just left to enjoy the aspects of adulthood as they come, and to remember the lessons we've learned in our past.

        So...what IS the live you intended, and what is the life you're living?       I've always been indecisive. I remember when I was young, drawing pictures of me in a tu-tu and ballet slippers. I was going to be a ballet teacher. I don't know why....maybe it was just because I thought the costume was pretty.    My parents would take me every year to see The Nutcracker Ballet. I remember watching, and thinking...I belong up there. I took tap and ballet...excelling at both, and at some point decided it wasn't for me.       The story of my life. It's not for me.       This was the general theme of my life. My parents (God love them for being so patient) always let me try anything I wanted. There were no limits, no rules...except for one. Once I started, I had to finish out the year.    So, I did...I played softball and tennis, took ballet, piano, and theater. I think I even did Girl Scouts at some point.    But, nothing ever "clicked" with me.       Don't get me wrong...I've excelled at just about everything I've ever done. I wasn't ever flat out bad at anything. And, maybe that's all I wanted to know. That I  could  do it.       So, as I got older, that same idea floated with me throughout high school.    I had "friends" most of who turned on me two weeks before our graduation. Something else that always happened to me.....abandonment. And, I think that probably had a lot to do with why I never finish what I start...it's in my blood.       And, when I found my passion during my sophomore year of high school...I let it pass me by. Just like everything else.    I remember filling out my schedule for the next year, and finding Newspaper as one of my choices. It took me in. The thought of writing and gaining attention for my opinions was like what a poor girl thinks while staring in a Nieman Marcus window. (trust me, I know  both  feelings)   I remember the first few weeks of the semester, I had to spend learning the basics. Headlines, bylines, paragraphing, fonts...it was SO boring. And, then one morning, she asked the $10,000 dollar question.   Who wants to write an opinion piece for the paper?     I couldn't believe it! And when I turned around and saw that noone else in that class was interested, my hand shot up. Of course, the topic wasn't fun...it was about the new cameras they'd installed all over campus....but I still gave it my best and was thrilled to see my name right there on page 7! (Of COURSE I didn't expect the front page!)      I spent the next two years on the Pioneer Press staff. I loved every minute of it. My pieces were praised and critisized. I had one that caused so much trouble that it was banned. And, I had more investigative adventures a kid could want.    I was going to write my way right into a career with the most prestigious newspapers in the country. I'd be a world reknown journalist. People would write me hate mail, and I'd live among the greatest talents in news our world has ever known. Tom Brokaw was my hero!      So...I quit?       I abandoned my college education, and settled for a life of just getting by. I moved into an apartment with a friend, and spent my days working as a hostess for Red Lobster, and partying with people who didn't give a flying fuck about me unless I wanted to have a drink.       I don't remember at what point it all dawned on me that I was screwing up. But, it did, and I moved back home. The Prodigal Daughter stage is how I like to refer to it now. Thankfully my parents welcomed me back with open arms, and decided to let me work my life out on my own.       And, it was shortly after that that I hit reality as an adult.       I met Jonathan is March of 99'. He was adorable, and so was I...and dammit, we were in love. In April, we got engaged, and then...in June...I was pregnant. Good-bye life. Hello parenthood.    Of course, Jonathan stuck by me through it all. He married me and made a semi-honest women out of me. And, through him, I learned that sometimes you just have to grow up. Sometimes, the things we want have to be put aside because there are bigger fish to fry. And so, I became Gini-mom and wife, instead of Gini-the brilliant journalist.       The last five years have quickly passed me by as I've sat and felt bad for myself. My son has grown and my marriage has somehow flourished. It took a long time to discover who I am and what I want to do. Baby steps...that's all I can say.       I'm now writing a successful political blog...a rediscovered passion!   I'm in the midst of planning a political website that will be full of my writings and my opinions. And, hopefully, before too long, I'll be where I want to be. But, in order to be happy later....I'm going to have to work to be happy now.       And, I am. I've pissed away so many opportunities in my life. And, here I am...still reaping benefits AND punishments for those choices. But, I cannot abandon my life now. Because I never want to look back upon this moment and feel sorrow or regret.

       I'm so stressed today....  There's too much to think about. Too much to take care of.  Jonathan makes me angry. I know it's not his fault...but it seems that he leaves everything up to me to handle. I know he does it because he trusts me to do it right, and keep everything in order. But, when you handle it all on your own, it's easier to be hard on yourself when you fuck up.  My blog on Xanga is doing well....but I'm getting burnt out. Am I really making a difference? Am I really changing minds about this election? I feel like I have nothing original to give anymore. But, I have so many readers, and they expect it out of me.  My MSN groups are piling up. Some places I don't feel like I fit in. Some places I fit in too well. Women are so petty. Why is it that we can't just work to get a long? Someone is always trying to tell you how to parent your child. You're a bad mom if you do this...or if you don't do that. It's clique-ish sometimes....and I hate knowing that I'm a member of that clique.  Andrew gets his stitches out tomorrow. It's been a week, and I still feel like a horrible mom. I know it was an accident...he was just playing too rough in the house....but the looks people give you when they see that bandage on his head...it makes you feel like crap.  I'm hoping whatever depression it is I'm in will fade soon. I want to feel useful and happy again. I want to stop sleeping so much and being so cranky.
