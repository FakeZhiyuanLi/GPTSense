      well i made it through another day of summer. yay. i slept outside last night. it was windy and i got a whole bunch of tree things in my hair. ugg. and i got up like 3 hours earlier than usual. so i had an extra three hours to try to fill. (memo to self: don't wake up early). i have a pic of a flamingo on a sticky note that is stuck to my computer. wow. two things have happned this year that i thought would never happen. 1)nick west called my house. not for me but because a note in drew's yearbook said to. but he still called... and 2) mitch roberts was in my house. yes i know thats not that great but still....he is a pretty popular guy....but also a few fries short of a happy meal....if ya know what i mean (sorry if any of his friends are reading this. i dont mean to offend). aloha to y'all.

      this is a first. im actually up and ready to do something before noon. i love iTunes. i love Macs. yes, im a Mac person. now all i have to do is wait for the hate mail to come. ok, ok. pc's are ok....i guess. but Macs are definately better for graphic designing. and the apple thing is cool. and i just like Macs better. if you dont agree with me then fine. but i think you will agree that computers are cool. yeah.  funny story--i was at my dads photo studio cleaning with my friend elle. we were just finishing up and took the trash out. but i forgot to leave the door open. so when elle trys to open the door...its locked. haha. yeah. well we start to walk down the street and luckily theres a payphone. when elle calls her house her little brother answers and when you call collect it says "will  you accept a call from: (you say your name here)" and he just hung up. so she calls again and when her mom answers she's like why are you calling collect? and elle says that we're locked out. so elle's mom comes to get us and says that next time to put the key in your pocket. heh heh heh. well.......i think you can guess where the key  really  was. that was my moment of stupidity for yesterday.

      sooo...i just got msn messenger today. im proud. yay. someone call a dj quick! ha ha. wow. i need new socks. really bad. guess what--im gonna buy a snowboard. but not just any old snowboard. its  his  snowboard. and just in case he is reading this ill say his name is snakey joe (i know what ur thinkin julia) for protection purposes. i am going to treasure this new snowboard. it will bring me good luck. snakey joe is also moving. imagine that. i will miss him. i know he likes me. why else would he be too scared to call me (and have nick do it for him)? and glance at me a lot when im waiting by the stairs? and take a long time to think of what to wright in my yearbook? you be the judge.

      ya know whats wierd? those anti-depressant drug comercials. there are so many side effects you'd probably be happier if you  didn't  take the drug. but no, you wont be depressed anymore you'll just have a siesure every once in a while along with diarheah and insomnia. it's crazy.   i went to see harry potter the other day. it was cool. but i kept thinking that the 4th and 5th book was part of the 3rd one so when the movie ended i freaked out and thought they left out half of the book. so now to convince my self that they really did show all they need to im gonna read the third book again. it'll give me somerhing to do since im so bored.

      i have to go through my whole room and decide what to keep by thursday. ugg. today i went through my books and then fell asleep. then i watched tv for an hour, then slept more. after that i did some other things, but its a little hazy. and just a few minutes ago i finished going through my clothes. you wouldn't think that trying on about 50 shirts to see if they fit would give you a headache, but it does. hey how 'bout some british slang for the day?   cabbage : a slow person   -i know a lot of cabbages.         hooter : nose   -this could really confuse people.        cakehole : mouth   -shut your cakehole!!

       well last night i had my going away party. it was way fun. we basically hung out, hit a pinata and watched a movie. but it was still awesome. the movie, School of Rock, was awesome too. we brought our couch outside to watch the movie. we taped a sheet to the wall of my house as the screen and had a projector. it was like a big screen tv.  it was really cool. i got some really nifty gifts too. julia gave me this huge collage of a bunch of pictures from school. and guess who's picture is right in the middle? Drew's. hehe. anyhoo...she had all the people write something on the back of it. it was so cool. brandon mad me this awesome frame with more pictures in it. candace gave me a cool pen, some paper and some envelopes. i wonder what she's trying to tell me...umm...i got a watermelon magnet and this cool bath confetti from erica. zola gave me a mix cd with a poem she wrote on it and a cool necklace. oh and rene gave me a calling card which is a good idea so i dont waste my parents money talking on long distance. my mom's friend tom came too with some of his daughters friends. they were cool people. when i was getting food one of the people that came, oliver, was getting pixi-stix and said "ahh...so many memories....of bad headaches". and after the movie tom was like "im gonna get you that movie. ive decided thats what im gonna do for you birthday next year. and im gonna copy it. im not gonna buy the real thing. cuz ya know that pyrated (sp?) movies are always better than actually buying the movie". it was cool. tom is so funny. i think all ya'll would probably like him. oh and his daughter liz was talking about how her room-mate phil always wears her skirts. he's not gay! but she goes to like a hippie school and people do wierd stuff there. but really skirts are kinda comfy (the long ones) and think how comfy a guy would be in one? i mean scottish guys wear kilts so its not totally wierd.... i dont know...just think about...if you want to.....well anyhoo...i got some interesting advice..."if you are traveling and you want to have fun just ride a grayhound bus." i guess it would be kinda cool. ive neverbeen on a grayhound before. and tom kept talking about how my birthday was 4/20. then when they finally left oliver was like "happy birthday anna" (he did the peace sign like dustin does) and i said "but its not my birthday" he's like "oh well...happy...uhhh.....going away i guess"  but he was really cool. and if it wasnt for him we wouldn't have been able to watch that movie so he's a good guy for having that dvd player. yeah. even those college kids thought it was a cool party so im glad. alrighty... i think thats all i have to say.

       i talked on the phone for like 2 hours today. wow. i think it was about an hour and a half with julia, a little more than 20 min with robert, 5 min with elizabeth and like 40 sec. with brandon. yeah. that pretty much sums up my day for you. except we had some people look at our house today and they came back like 8 hours later with an offer. yeah cool huh. hmm. what else did i do today? oh yeah. i had a laugh attack. but it was sorta spread out over a while. nothing was even funny either and i would just crack up and i coudnt stop. and it really hurt my stomach cuz i was really hungry too. oh noo!! here it comes! and its like the silent laughter where you cant breathe in. whoa! dude! if you look at the cieling upside down it looks curved! this is awesome! if someone walkes in here right now they would think i was high. and its only 7:00! usually i dont even start acting like this until practically midnight. this is crazy. i just sounded like my cousin marci. ahh poo.  HA HA HA I DID IT AGAIN!!!!! whoo! this is sooo awesome!! ha ha ha! oohh. now im sad. im moving. i dont want to. and this sum*41 song isnt helping the mood either. ahh poo. hahaha! that helped! ahh poo. mmm pie. oohh. now im sad again. booger. hehe. ohh. now my stomach hurts. i think i laughed too much. this sucks. and im scared about the first day of school. i dont want to have to ask someone where something is and look stupid or get lost and look even more stupid. i only sorta know one person there and he's going into highschool so that sucks. he would have helped me. i guess im having new kid anxiety....if there is such a thing. i dont want school to start. i need help.

       why do we only have one tv in this household when our tastes in what to watch are so different? i like vh1 and mtv and my dad hates those, my brother only watches the history channel and simpsons, and my mom constantly flips through the channels and never actually stops to watch the whole show. and then if i am watching something that my dad does apporve of he comes in the middle of the show and wants to know what is going on and then when i finally tell him that if he wanted to know whats is happening he should have come in the beginning of the show.  then he gets all mad at me for not wanting to explain the whole thing to him when im trying to follow whats going on. *sighs* that felt good to let it out. ok then.

        how are all you folks doin out there? im doing fine here but my neck hurts. and im hungry. im hungry a lot come to think of it. but i never really gain any weight. hmm. i saw the movie  i, robot  today. it is really cool. if you like action movies then you would like this one. it is very interesting. the last 4 sentences started with the letter i. thats wierd. have you noticed that i never use&nbsp;apostrophies in my writing? oh well. you still know what im trying to say so i guess theres no problem then is there. oh, and the movie has shia lebouf (i dont know how to spell his name) in it too and hes pretty funny. so yeah i dont have much else to say. i am writing this from my grandparents house in case you wanted to know. i dont think you even care though. and after like 2 months we are finally getting some film developed. yay! now i can see my pictures from school and church camp. alright. well then. i guess ill be going then.

       my parents are some. my dad has officially dubbed that show "inapropriate". now i cant watch the show when my parents are home or if the simpsons are on at the same time. even though michael has seen every episode of the simpsons at least twice he still cant miss a show. why? i dont know. and my mom is home most of the day but she's usually outside. but she comes inside and downstairs at like the funniest times in the show.  it sucks cuz then i have to change the channel right in the middle of it. bummer. i wish i had a tv in my room like julia does. then i could watch bascially what i wanted. that would be cool. heh heh heh.

       i walked into the bathroom and turned on the light and i saw this face in the window and it almost scared the shit out of me. please excuse my language but its true. the face had big eyes and brown messy hair and looked like death. really. but then i just realized..... it was just my reflection after all. true story. ask my attourney ( is that how you spell it?). but i dont have an attourney so screw that idea. i dont know but mabey 3 hours of vh1 does something to you. just like eating half a pizza gets you wired. really. a moth just landed on the screen. it'll be like the ring and ill pick the fly off the screen even though it was part of the movie. but this moth wasnt part of the computer so i guess that wont work. whoa. i keep whoa. i like that. whoa. whoa. whoa. w-h-o-a. ok back to the sentence i keep staring off into limited space. yeah its limited. im in a house. you cant have endless space in a house. think about it. i think im gonna go to the kitchen to get something to eat. yeah where else am i getting stuff to eat? the bathroom? i dont think so. ok so i didnt find anything to eat in the kitchen. mabey ill try the library. mmmm....would you like some paperback with that shakespear? heh heh heh uhhh no. would you like cheese on your mom? oh yes please. i would love to have some cheese on my mom. NOT! but seriously a mom is a kind of burger at this really good place called carters and so if someone ever askes the question "do you want cheese on your mom?" and you happen to be standing in a burger joint at the time please do say yes. it would make your mother proud. if you had walked into the room 30 seconds ago you would think i passed out on the floor. but i just spun around in the chair like 1 time and i fell out of that chair and didnt get up for a while. true story. i wish i could make soup right now. i like soup. i have had some pretty crazy experiences with soup. i yelled at my door while eating soup. really. no lie. but what reson would i have to lie? none. my life is as boring as it is and you might as well hear all of it. well having said that i think it is my time to go. actually that was just a cheesy way to end this so i can go watch tv. really i going to end this now.

       i probably look so stupid sitting at the computer with my mouth wide open and my hair in my face. oh well. i dont care all that much. does anybody know when Zola is coming back? i really need to know. of course it would probably be easier to actually email Zola herself instead of asking you guys cuz i know how reliable you all are.....heh heh heh. i think i was gonna post something important today but i forgot what it was.crap. oh and elle? if you read this can you tell me when you're coming back? friends if you are there, please...do.....crap. i for got how i was gonna end that sentence. nice. way to go me. all the summer fun (NOT) (except when im w/ friends) has slowed my mind....more than usual at least. i think i need to get out more often...but its too hot so that ain't gonna happen any time soon...mabey in a month or two...or three. who knows...i may become a hermit and stay hidden all my life and only come out when they are serving those crepes at village inn. even though ive never even had crepes at village inn...

       ok so here's the story. we (julia, lexi, lexi's cuz, me, my bro, my cuz, and my dad) were all gonna go see spider man 2. but we were a little confused on who was taking us there. so  i had to do a lot of calling to figure it out. we came up with the plan to have julia's mom take julia, lexi, and her cuz and have my dad drive me, my cuz and my bro to the theater. and after the movie julia's mom was gonna pick us all up. but i added the number of people wrong and found out that  we could have taken everybody in our car and my dad wanted to be the hero and take everyone back instead of julia doing it. but i told him that we already had it all worked out but noooooo he wants to change all the plans even though we were already so mixed up. so my mom is like whats going on so i try to explain it to her and she's like "well we can take everyone back from the movie" and im like "no julia's mom is gonna do that and its too late to change plans now". then my dad is like "i dont think you deserve to go to the movie if your gonna talk to your mother like that". so that was basically it. and my cousin said "if you're not gonna go then i dont wanna go" but my dad basically made her go because he "didn't want her to be miserable with me". aaaugh. i hate parents.

(see above band.) my new room is a lot smaller that my room here. barely enough room for my bed and drums. i want elle to come home. cuz im bored. she is good at being bored with me. it is very uneventful when we are bored. and i want her to come back so i can pay her guitar a visit. i went to the mall a couple days ago. we went into zumies and the cashier was sooo cute and i think he smiled at me and i liked his hair. ow. now my neck hurts. oh and there were some wierd people in hot topic. it was cool though. i think my mom was afraid to come in to the store to give us something cuz she reached way around the side of the door and didnt even take a step inside. oh well. i wnt ot keep typing but i have nothing else to say...
