       So, I'm afraid the metamorphasis has begun.  I am becoming an angry New Yorker.  You know what causes it?  Subway+Humidity+ all the damn tourists who want to walk at a leisurely pace.  I think we could prove it scientifically.  At first I thought I was grumpy because we didnt have any gas or hot water (dejavu Kelvin, anyone???) but then after I took a too-long-make-me-late shower this morning and still arrived at work irritated, I realized it was because I had too many people touching me...bumping into me, and stepping on my feet.   I just wanted to finish Catcher in the Rye for crying out loud... (fantastic book, by the way)      However, the clincher came later this evening.  Someone stepped on my flipflops while I was walking--twice, and the look I threw back must have been whithering, because I had a large, angry-looking black woman apologize profusely, and then bust the hell out of there.  I didn't think little old me could look so scary...      That really made me pause.  Yes, I am an excellent bitch, I'll admit that.  But mostly I'm a nice person...so how do I make sure I don't become one of  them?    I want to be on Spain pace...not a care in the world!  So I'm gonna have to trick myself--either that, or start taking siestas under my desk....

      My cat is a freaking weirdo--running through the house and meowling like a banshee on a pogo stick.   I need a vacation to Super Mario Brothers 3 where you can bounce on a mushroom and then fly up into the clouds and collect free money.  Holy cow, batman.  I need a personal assistant!  I can't remember to be a good person anymore--forgetting birthdays and anniversaries, not returning phone calls, breaking social plans on a constant basis because of work--I'm that person I hate.  Career Woman, ah wha, what??  Maybe I can find someone online who likes to be ordered around, not paid and worked to the bone.  Oh wait,  I  could answer that want ad...  Sickest thing?  I like my job.  I'm a sadist.  Today, I learned the number one rule in my field:  Don't make social plans if there even a whiff of a creative presentation on the calendar.  Riiggghhhht, OK.  Scheisse.  Sorry Macoy.  Must......Go.........To........Bed.  Need to refuel rocket boosters.  Am running low on fuel and am requesting a fly by.  Care Bear, STARE.  Evil thoughts of what I have to do at work tomorrow have melted away and now I can sleep like a pumpkin in a blanket.

      I am a delicacy for Mosquitos.  They feast on me during the night, so now in addition to my freaky 'tan' lines and ever-surfacing bruises, I have constellations of mosquito bites all over!  Probably because of the lake that tends to surface outside my window.  However, when faced with the obvious 'close your window, stupid,' the thought of sweltering in the humidity while trying to sleep beats out closing the window anyday.  Jeff has some screens in his room, covert operation screen stealer has been enacted.  Poor bastard mosquitos were in for a surprise last night though...they must have been drunk as hell.  I hope they died.  Lesson of the Day:  Do not give drunk people gum--or if you do, take it back before they pass out.  Woke up in the cab with it stuck all over my shirt and bag.  Not fun.  Deep Thought:  Black leather couches and a big fuck-off TV is not a pre-requisite for25 year old guys who suddenly have too much money!  Its not cool.  It's not protocol.  Its LAME as hell

      I just watched some syncronized diving on TV..brilliant, however the volleyball didn't pull me in for some reason and instead I have queer eye for the straight guy in the background. Am going to some rich-boy rooftop party tonight and can't wear the top I want because of my retarded burn lines. Adventure should be in the cards as Monica and I prepare to embark on our famous "M nights." Although, I had a mango martini last night and it wasn't the same. However, I still managed to pass out fully clothed. Brings back memories of college. Blackouts rock.  Hannes, there is more than one person with that name in New York, however i will work on finding a Rachel, Ross, Phoebe, and Chandler. YOU CAN do it!...DO IT, DO IT* (combination of voices from WaterBoy and Starsky and Hutch) If   I am able to do so, we will have to have a huge central perk party in your honor.  Craziness awaits me...wish me luck. Hey, maybe I'll find me a sugar daddy. NYC is too expensive, so that would be FANTASTIC. Although, I tend to do my best shopping when I have NO money...whenever I can spend money I never find anything I like. Speaking of thing I like and things I don't like. I hate budgets.  How on earth do creatives spend $30,000 on illustrations for the first of many creative presentations??? I mean, the client hated most of them and now I have to find a way to pay for it as we only had $6000 in the budget. Damn other-brained sided people.

      Really, all I wanted to do was post a silly comment on Hannes' blog, and well....here I am!  I ate your bees and now I'm buzzing around this great city trying to make sense of it all.  Which, I admit would probably be easier if I drank less, slept more, and well...didn't spend as much money.  However, I don't see that happening any time soon.
