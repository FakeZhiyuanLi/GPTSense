       [Current Music - Counting Crows - Time & Time Again]  I just had a look at some profiles...there's so many fans of The Who Horrah!  I went into town for an hour or so today.. Was going to park myself in the Peace Gardens and read my book (Alex Harvey's biography at the moment) for a bit, but it was full of half naked kids screaming in the fountains.  So that plan went out the window. I just had a wander instead, it was quite nice really, haven't done it for ages.  I go to London on Wednesday, I'm sort of looking forward to it, I guess.  Josh's party is on the Friday, I don't really want to go, I hardly know anyone who's going.  I'll see what happens, maybe I'll come down with some illness so I can skip it.  Hmm  I wish I was going to Leeds festival, for more reasons than just the bands.  Oh well, next year.  It's my brothers 21st pretty soon, he's so hard to buy for, I'll think of something.   I'm just rambling now, this is very disjointed, I apologise..  I'm trying my best to keep myself occupied so I don't smoke, and to take my mind off other things.  It's damn hard.  I just realised, today was the only time I've been in town and haven't gone in Freshmans, thats strange.  What was I thinking? Obviously I wasn't...  Anyway, I'm all out of garbage for now, might write something later.

       [Current Music - Stone Temple Pilots - Unplugged]   I still havent smoked, which I'm quite proud of.. I can see it making me cranky at some point, hope it doesn't though. I've downloaded tons of stuff lately, got 15 albums the other night..saved me about £150.. Horrah! I'm off to London on Wednesday... Should be good, I hope so anyway.  A week and a bit not talking to Alex will be strange though.  ho hum. I'm hungry, I might abandon this in a minute and search for food. Yep, think I will, minds a bit empty at the moment anyway =)

       [Current Music - The Underwater - Branded]  I feel so shitty, it's untrue.  It's lack of sleep, makes me cranky with everyone, I can hardly hold my head up, my necks aching. I feel like I've been away for ages, I haven't but still.  I've got nothing to write about, but I'll still fill space with utter garbage. I want to go into town, but train fare will cost me £5, and that's pretty much all the money I have gone.  And then I'll need cigarettes.  My dad still owes me £20, but I doubt I'll ever get it.  I have no idea how I'm going to afford this week in London, especially with Josh's party, all my money will go on drink.  There's the gig at the Grapes tonight, it's some guy called Paul and a couple of others doing an acoustic set.  I don't think I'm going. Hardly anyone's online, wish they would be, I'm so bored.  Can't think of anything else to write, think I'll go make a cup of tea.

       [Current Music - Midnight Oil - Beds are Burning]   Every profile I've come across belongs to someone from singapore! Is there any english we ask ourselves?! Well, I ask myself as I seem to be the only one..

       [Current Music - Steve Vai &amp; Ry Cooder - The Duel From Crossroads]   Today is too hot, far too hot. I went to buy some cigarettes and lost about a stone in sweat, its horrid. i'm also rather hacked off, nothing to do, no one around, and everyone else is in a bad mood which doesn't really help. I feel like going to a gig of some sort, but there isn't anyone decent on. Been invited to one tomorrow, but not sure if I'l go or not, I don't even know the guy.  This sites a whole lot better than live journal, better features etc. And your pictures don't have to be the size of a sucidial girls ego.   This blog will last about a week, then I'll get bored and create something else, sorry to anyone who finds this the slightest bit interesting. It would be nice to get a comment, cause so far i haven't looked at anyone elses blog/profile. the truth is I don't know how, ha! And I'm predicted A* in I.T...  I'm going to go waste some time doing something else now.

      So, I just started this, I haven't looked at anyone elses, so have no idea whether mine looks like complete toss. Nevermind. I'm leaving this short while I check things out.
