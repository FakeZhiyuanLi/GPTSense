      Moving to a new place is uncomfortable. There is the hurried anxiety followed by nervous excitement and inevitability the comfort settles in. I don’t like the comfort part. That is the part where I get restless and tormented. It is like everything in life that lacks ingenuity. It is all that is pre-packaged food, happy children, and muggy summer days. To further explain, it is the comfort in life that makes you average. Every major political and social upheaval has been based on uncomfortable life. Comfortable people wear house shoes and sip coffee and read about uncomfortable people like fiction. Stories coughed-up by obviously sickened individuals.  Uncomfortable people grate against others and themselves. They lead revolutions in their minds and spend many hours locked in quiet frustration. For many, they never can truly manifest their neurosis into anything real or practical, so they live in constant anguish, which becomes a pitiable comfort. Those who can transcend the mental prison of their minds become people totally innovative and radical.  But I digress. Moving to New York City was the fourth big move in my life. I was born in Denver, Colorado in 1981. At the age of eleven I moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico with my family. Seven years later I moved to Boston for college. One more trip back to Santa Fe after graduation, and then here to New York City, Brooklyn to be exact. That is a lot of time covered in a few short sentences. It could all be wrapped up thusly, but I’ll soon go into more detail about each such place in my life and how it relates ultimately to my own tormented mind.

      As I was rushing along 3rd Avenue today eagerly anticipating my first morning cup of joe, I stepped on something firm yet squishy.  To my horror, I looked down to see a mass of feathers and flesh.  A bird.  I had stepped on a dead bird.  Actually I slipped on a dead bird which caused me to almost fall, and for the bird’s feathers to peel off exposing ripe red flesh.  A spectator nearby gave me (and the smeared bird) a sensitive look as she whisked past as if to say, ‘What a sucker.’  I had one of two possible reactions.  I could stand there and scream causing groups of New Yorkers to break from their commutes to stare at me.  Or I could do what I did, and limp away as if nothing happened.  I glanced down at my four dollar black Chinatown slip-on in absolute disgust.  It could have been worse really.  I could have been wearing expensive shoes.  Or I could have been in heels, in which case I would have impaled the innocent bird.  I would then have to hobble to the curb and scrape the poor devil off into the street, again eliciting the attention of others.  I should consider myself lucky.   For the remainder of my three block commute, I dragged the offending shoe across the concrete in hopes of scraping off the residual bird goo that I had imagined were clinging to my poor four dollar shoes.  Once I reached the lawn of the university where I work, I quickly flipped off the tainted shoe and rubbed it against the grass, not even wanting to look at the bottom with all the juicy guts.  I was quite satisfied with my job when I looked up to see that president of the university staring at me through his office window.  He was talking into an ear piece so I assume he was conducting important business via telephone or dictating a bit of information, but he still was rather intrigued by what was happening on the lawn outside his office.  As we made eye contact he turned quickly and walked back toward a less obvious spot in his office.  Again I limped away as if nothing happened.  It's going to be one of those days.
