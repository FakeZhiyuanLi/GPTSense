           The faces of early nineties punk.     Today we will be reviewing the band NWA. Now, I don't know anything about them and (sadly) my Realistic Cassette player just broke, but I have been told that NWA (Nubians With Alpacas) is a group from Compton in southern California.     Knowing what I do about otherCalifornian bands (Hardcore bands like: Blink 182, New Found Glory, and Kenny G) I would assume that they play poppy-punk music that mimics such early southern Californian bands as Agent Orange.    Now, I just love these bands! The bright hair and studded belts! So sassy. I am in such anticipation of listening to this cd that I found myself running down to Kmart to pick up a studded belt to get in the spirit of things!        I swear to Sid, this is the best place to get punked out!  You have to go to the womens section, though (wink).     While I was there I also purchased a copy of the new Blink 182 cd. Who knew that you could sing so many songs about girls! Why one day those boys may meet some girls and I guess then they won't have anything to sing about.    Based on my love of poppy songs about girls and personal angst, I will tenetively give NWA's "Straight Outta Compton" eleven William H Macy's pending further review.  Oi! Oi! Oi!

      I was downtown a few weeks ago, searching through dumpster for AOL CDs (I just don't have enough) when I came across a mixtape (ok, CD). Hesitant, but thoroughly bored, I placed it in the CD drive.     That is a sweet mix you might say!     As soon as I pushed play I was assaulted by such overwhelming musical bombasticism that I crumpled into a ball on the floor. As the tracks progressed, I struggled to reach my seat. I could not bear to divorce myself from such beautiful tones, but I could scarcely stand to listen. As the world grew dark, I asked myself "Is this the end?" fortunately, I was awoken by my dog urinating on my belongings (good boy?). I fear that the only thing that saved me, was the random play of the tracks.  Surely had I heard them in order I would be dead.      1) "Can I Kick It?" -- A Tribe Called Quest   2) "Substitute" -- The Who   3) "When I'm 64" -- The Beatles   4) "The Harder They Come" -- Jimmy Cliff   5) "Time Bomb" -- Rancid   6) "Folsom Prison Blues" -- Johnny Cash   7) "Just What I Needed" -- The Cars   8) "Diane" -- Husker Du   9) "This Way Out" -- Rocket From The Crypt   10) "Anchor" -- Osker   11) "In Between Days" -- The Cure   12) "Wrong 'em Boyo" -- The Clash   13) "Total Immortal" -- AFI      What would kill you?

      When you fall off of a five foot high ladder bridge and bend (break) the rear swingarm and the rear disc rotor of your bike, it's the little things that count.    Like your dog pissing on your furniture...    The technical lead on your software team being something of a luddite...    Working in a cube farm...    You're living the high life.

      I decided to blog because I can.  Like the world needs to hear my asinine thoughts, but this is easier than keeping my website up to date.
