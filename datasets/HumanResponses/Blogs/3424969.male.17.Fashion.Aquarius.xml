      so tired right now.  just finished writing my 55 word short story.  aha took sooo long cuz there are too many people online to talk to.  XD  whatevers.  also cuz i did my first 5 hours of community service today and it is soo krajjee not ggangpae.  i had to sit there and run cards through some system for 3.5 hours and reshelve dirty smelly clothes for the other 1.5.  but i got to watch disney movies while i did it and i talked to this frosh girl from willow glenn cuz she was volunteering too.  lalala.  i should go to sleep now, but i sorta don wanna. im hecka tired and shit, but im sorta energetic still if you know what i mean.  aha.  its like oxymoron.  whatever.  maybe its a result of my tiredness.  or my retardedness. or both.  im going to sleep. aha.

O_O  and then i learned.  rest of the school day was normal.  and then i went to stenseths farewell party.  was sorta boring, but i g2 chillax wid mis hombres.  sorry bout that emily, but i was seriously juss playin around with michelles thingies. :O/  then i went home and studied a little more... and then...   POPS  pops was fun.  went to pick up nicole at around 640. ahaha. i was gon b @ lynbrook by 7, but mi madre made me go earlier.  ended up waiting 10 minutes for nicole to find something to wear and get into it.  shit it takes girls long to dress. ahaha. all she ended up doing was put on a shirt. -_____-;; she saw the top of mine and like... dtw. ahaha.so i zipped up my jacket more and we went to lynbrook... and then jing raped me.  i heard her go oh my god... and the walked up to me.  "jason... ::grabs and unzips jacket:: i cant believe you did this!!"  yeah.  good shit.  and then i zipped it back up so i could surprise the orchestra, but then the seniors raped me again when we were setting up the stage.  ahaha.  i got grabbed from behind and they like, ripped my jacket off completely.  al;sdfjal;sdfjasl.  anyways. yeah.  my pink shirt, red spotted tie, and pink hankerchief and charissa's pink shades (which i wore on the back of my head)were huge hits i think. well, i heard a shitload of cheering/laughing when i walked on stage.  and then during intermission, emily and michelle walk up to me and are like "what the fuck is this" holding my tie.  and then like, "and this?!!" holding my shirt.  i would think such smart people would know.  oh well.  btw u guyz, it was a red spotted tie and a pink shirt.  saturday is being boring so im not posting anything for it.  stupid saturday.  i wish i had sf. aha.

      I'm hecka bored now... and i found this. ahaha.  The world today is absolutely cracked. With nuclear bombs to blow us all sky high. There's fools and idiots sitting on the trigger. It's depressing, and it's senseless, and that's why...  (singing) I like chinese, I like chinese, They only come up to you knees, Yet they're always friendly and they're ready to to please.  I like chinese, I like chinese, There's nine hundred million of them in the world today, You'd better learn to like them, that's what I say.  I like chinese, I like chinese, They come from a long way overseas, But they're cute, and they're cuddly, and they're ready to please.  I like chinese food, The waiters never are rude, Think the many things they've done to impress, There's maoism, taoism, eging and chess.  I like chinese, I like chinese, I like their tiny little trees, Their zen, their ping-pong, their ying and yang-eze.  I like chinese thought, The wisdom that Confusious taught, If Darwin is anything to shout about, The chinese will survive us all without any doubt.  So, I like chinese, I like chinese, They only come up to you knees, Yet they're wise, and they're witty, and they're ready to please  Wo ai Zhong-guo ren	                       [Wo, I chumba run] Wo ai Zhong-guo ren Wo ai Zhong-guo ren Ni Hao Ma? Ni Hao Ma? Ni Hao Ma? Zai zhen      [Ne hamma? ... Chi Chen]  I like chinese, I like chinese, They're food is guaranteed to please, A fourteen, a seven, a nine and li-chese  I like chinese,  I like chinese,  I like their tiny little trees, Their zen, their ping-pong, their yin and yang-eze  I like chinese, I like chinese, (fade out....)

      wow... tour was so fun.&nbsp; i'm sure i'll want to be back later, but i'll say that as of now, i'm glad to be back home. &nbsp; for starters, service in our hotels was krajee.&nbsp; aha.&nbsp; we had hella bellboys waiting for us, so like, if we came back from town in a taxi, one would run over to open the car door for us while a second would hold the hotel door open for us.&nbsp; and if it was raining, a third would walk us back with an umbrella.&nbsp; =D&nbsp; also, if it's raining, they walk you as far as a block with an umbrella.&nbsp; good shit. &nbsp; food was ok.&nbsp; had some bad experiences with them restaurants, but overall it was good.&nbsp; you gotta love european steak.&nbsp; *sigh* aha.&nbsp; too much potatoes for breakfast and lunch though.&nbsp; bastards tried to gyp us by overloading us with carbs so we wouldnt eat so much. &nbsp; started out in vienna, austria.&nbsp; crazy good hotel, breakfast was good.&nbsp; but, we got same breakfast every day for 3 weeks, so we all got sick of it.&nbsp; 2nd night there, errbody got tipsy. =D ill leave it at that.&nbsp; our concert halls were great. &nbsp; then was lyon.&nbsp; france was ok.&nbsp; had best concert venues, but everything was too cheesy.&nbsp; not much to say here.&nbsp; my friend got sent back home, but whatever.&nbsp; paris was tight.&nbsp; food was around same.&nbsp; i saw the spiderman 2 premiere.&nbsp; XD tobey mcguire and kirsten dusnt were there. good shit. &nbsp; cologne, germany was on our way to mainz, germany.&nbsp; good place.&nbsp; our hotel was downtown.&nbsp; it was crazy.&nbsp; just imagine a city of 6-5 drunk germans.&nbsp; bottles were rolling all over the floor and i swear i saw some saringes too.&nbsp; but i saw the best display of fireworks ever.&nbsp; and they were to classical music.&nbsp; aha.&nbsp; best night i had though.&nbsp; we all got tipsy after that. &nbsp; next day,&nbsp;half the orchestra was&nbsp;given a talk for multiple things : smoking in the rooms, being too loud, underage drinking, etc. &nbsp; berlin was ok.&nbsp; half the orchestra was under house arrest the first night.&nbsp; second day was ok.&nbsp; not much to see in berlin.&nbsp; we counted bear statues&nbsp;and left the day after. &nbsp; amsterdam.&nbsp; first of all. red light district is crazy.&nbsp; not saying anything cuz anyone can read this.&nbsp; ask me personally for details.&nbsp; but that is the best city in the world. &nbsp; tour was fun.&nbsp; i found out who the slut of the orch. is.&nbsp; but she thinks i don't know.&nbsp; whatever.
