						      Hello to all of you.  I hope that you're well.  This was a long book.  It had a beautiful beginning.  I too was captured by the intrigue of the Templers.  I rushed through days to read into the evenings about their kundalini enticing rituals and voyages through the fabric of history.  But after about 250 pages I got tired.  Eco's writing is beautiful and descriptive, but sometimes terribly superfluous and circular.  While that may be the aim, his literatry style is lost on me when there isn't an intriguing point being made.  Maybe this is the effect of childhood Christopher Pike novels and movies like Die Hard.... I suppose I don't have a very good attention span.       Speaking of movies.  Did anyone else pick up on the similarities to Indiana Jones and the Last Crudsade?       In reading the middle section it seemed that their reasoning went amiss.  I assumed this was Eco's way of depicting the evolution of a madman, or madmen.  Do you agree?  It seemed reasoning went foggy and terms, places, historical events were jumbled into a mass of paragraphs that ended with,  " And see that is how it all fits together."   I am making it out to be much worse than in actually was...  Kindly, I do wonder what you gentlemen think.         One thing that saddened me very much was my ill knowledge of Italy between 1960-1990.  I found many of his, I'm sure brilliant, analogies lost to my minimal knowledge of his cultural reference.       Belbo...I found him horribly interesting and grungy with a napoelean complex.  At least he realized he only loved women who would never love him in return.  But still, his illusions of grandure (ie. the trumpet)  PLEASE.     D...I liked his quiet sober manor.  He was a nice balance for the rest of the characters.  Though he did get carried away as well.  I very much respected his part in theending....which I won't discuss yet.     Aglie...I liked him at the time of his introuducion.  But at the end....he was just strange.  Eco seemed to build him up as this increadible being shrouded in mystery, and then his weakness at the end....it was quite a let down.      The women in this novel, and this is where I sound like a feminist, they were interesting.  Sophia, I expected more from.  Somehow she did not harness the uber sexuality her predecessors radiated.  I wanted more from the wanton villianous of the ages.  His first girlfriend, I thought she was fun.  Though her discomfort and total shut off after the Umbada experience, was too convenient.  She was too easily disposed of.  Lia.  hmmm.  As much as she loved Causbon, she was a very flat boring character.  I could always count on her to sqwash his theory and trample his manhood with a speech about mother earth, creation, and his "energetic cock".  I suppose she was like the outside world always exposing him for who he was.        There are many more things I could write about each character...and many other aspects of the book, but I want to hear what you guys have to say.    Smile      Vanessa

						   Let me first get my questions out in the open before I start in with my commentary.  What do the names at the beginning of the sections mean? Am I the only one that is almost completely in the dark when it comes to the passages at the beginning of each chapter? The knowledge we [humanity] have of the templars, is that based on fact or myth?    Alright. First of all I am finding this book just as the Time critic on the cover -- "Endlessly diverting...and absorbing." I feel that I have not quite been as interested in learning about anything as I am with the Templars and the Rosencrucians.   This book is right up my alley. For a while now I have been less and less interested in looking towards religion as a means of strengthening my faith. I believe that, throughout history, religious institutions have abused their innate power of influence to press personal agendas that may or may not align with needs of their constituents. My point...I have an open mind when it comes to religion and religious artifacts and religious facts. For example I am very interested in the idea brought up that various myths of artifacts (eg. the philosopher's stone and the holy grail) could possibly have originated from the same source. These kind of "Indiana Jones" type myths or pieces of history have some sort of romantic mysticism that I can't get enough of.  Europe's extensive history might have been the most intriguing part of my travels a few years ago.   Since nothing of note has really happened yet I will take this time to just talk.   When I was in high school Mr. Vogel, my history teacher, talked about his becoming a historian. Well, maybe it was just him talking about grad school, but I always wondered what a historian wished to do with history. This book has opened my eyes to a part of history that I had not given much thought to -- patterns. Mr. Vogel was the first person that I had ever heard talk about patterns in history (other than the saying "history repeats itself"). This book makes the assertion that there is much if not everything to learn about history through mathematics and more specifically pattern recognition. From reading the back of the book we know that all this information that we get in the first part of the book will be processed through a super computer designed to find patterns in that information. Could this lead to us trying to predict the future?

						   Here begins the official blog.  The first book is Umberto Eco's "Foucault's Pendulum".  Happy reading!  Each phase of book discussing (per Jason's instructions) will be done under these larger posts.  To discuss, ramble, pontificate, etc., post a comment under this post.  In order to do that, you'll need to be a member of the blog.  You can get your own login by e-mailing me.  After you have it, just click on the link below this post to post a comment.

						   I found the following to be shocking: "a former professional football player in the United States has an average life-expectancy of about fifty-six years" (pg 71).  To put this in perspective, that is the same as the male average life expectancy in Sudan, which has been going through a horrific, brutal civil war for more than 20 years.    In general, I am really enjoying this book.  I think that if I had read it before my freshman year of high school, I would have enjoyed high school much more.
