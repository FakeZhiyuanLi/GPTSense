      So, after reading at various times on my favorite author's blog about non-saved and erased blog entries, I've at last suffered the same fate.  And sure enough, it was a very very important entry.  Full of wonder and shocking twists.  Really.  It was.  I was typing along, writing about my day back home, full of detail and fluff.  Was getting around to my plants, reliving the stories of their namings when Lorraine IMed me.  The rest of the entry summarized that non-conversation and the torment that went along with it.  Just finished spell-checking my entry for the final time and was IMed by a stranger.  Decided to check out the profile of said stranger and was faced with a "save entry" question and I, unwittingly, clicked "cancel" just before I realized what that meant.    I'll gather myself and try again.  Deep inhalation, and:  Ahhh home again.  (That's really how the first one started, I remember that much.)  Made it in 9 hours.  Slept late this morning and made a real breakfast.  Yay.  Finally got around to putting up new art work and repairing old this afternoon.  Running a fan all night to mask the sounds of neighbors and highway isn't all that conducive to long-lasting adhesive devices.  Did some Property reading for tomorrow, but never got around to doing the practice exam; maybe it'll get done tomorrow.  But it's World AIDS Day tomorrow and I'm supervising the mircophone hook-up process in the courtroom, heavy responsibility.  See the Property practice exam moving to Wednesday.  Maybe I just won't take the final at all.  Listened to Tori's Collection while puttering and it's really not that bad.  They are all improvements, and good ones at that!  Suppose it won't be banished to the CD shelf (graveyard) just yet.   The plants made it through their week alone.  They were pretty dry and gasping for breath when I returned, but they perked right up after a shot of vodka each.  They're spider plants and the first living things I've ever cared for.  Now I've got to hook up to AC power before my battery goes dead and I lose a 2nd post.  There.  So yea, Levi brought the first plant from Oregon over the summer.  Came home from work one day to find my Shakespeare anthology on the table. "You name the plant?" "Yup....Calphurnia." "Calphurnia?!" "That's right." "Okay." Related the story to Lorraine that night and she replied: "Ahhh, Caesar's wife." There'd been a TNT original movie on that night about the man.  One rarely gets a better set up than that.  She'd just IMed me as I finished that story the first time.  She wanted to visit, to see how I'm doing, to make sure I'm okay.  She was afraid, during my time to think and reflect, I'd decided to hate her and forged regret, which has always been her greatest fear.  I sounded very detached and harsh when I wrote back that I didn't hate her, I have no regrets and we weren't going to chat about anything.  It was very weird.  And Dido started singing about her White Flag in the middle of it.  Over the course of the rest of the entry, in which I described the birth and naming of Calphurnia's daughter, Trudi, Lorraine asked whether she could still call if it was critical that she speak to me.  Not tonight; just for future reference.  Kept thinking about her forwarded email and what a shit I felt like for not sending a one-line reply, similar to the one-line responses I gave her tonight.  I'd planned to type about her originally, but clearly hadn't expected what actually happened.  Been wondering about all the Lorraine-related stuff I've got around and trying to decide whether to put it all way for the duration.  Like her old shirt I still sleep in, for example.  Any thoughts, dear readers?  I don't have a shrine, but there's a fair amount of innocent little things around.  Should it all disappear, for a bit at least?    She kept typing a message and stopping.  That's one of my favorite features on IM.  Just as I was finishing the entry and getting ready to start spell checking it, she sent a final message and signed her name.    And that's how it really happened.  This entry's not as good as the original, but it'll do.

      In 8 hours I'll be dragging myself out of bed, making the final decision of which route to take home to Moscow.  If the weather's going to be as joyous as last weekend, I think I'll zoom through Boise instead.  Not too excited about dealing with the remaining 300 miles of two-way highway, but you just never know.    So the big dinner went off without a hitch.  Grandpa and Grandma were wandering around, going through the motions and everyone there tried (pretty successfully) not to talk about the big boulder sitting in the middle of the room.    "We don't own this house anymore!" / "I sure am going to miss this house."  Were pretty much Grandpa's conversation pieces all evening.  Still can't shake the feeling that this whole "new house" business is the beginning of what we (the fam) gets to look forward to for many years to come.  They'll pack all of their boxes of shit into a house a fraction of the size the one they've lived in for 44 years, move it around, get organized and it won't be home.  Sigh.  Went to Burley today to spend the biggest shopping day of the year with Mom's mom--Grandma Leah.  She used to not be my favorite Grandma for a while, but now she's a riot.  Very much a little old lady on a farm in the middle of nowhere who, when venturing out to get her paper/mail, will run back behind her bushes if she hears a car coming down the road.  She hates cats and has about 5, 3 of which come around regularly.  She won't see "The Green Mile" because it has a mouse in it.  We cruised the Twin Falls mall, prowling for bargains.  She walked with her arm through mine; it was adorable.    Had beers tonight at my cousin Rob's and his incredible wife Trish's new house.  You think MY house is a mountain fortress, honey...jeeeezzz!  Talk about a party!  Just on our way home when said incredible wife started dishing about her in-laws (Dad's brother, my aunt and uncle).  I love talking to kick ass family members about the shitty ones behind their backs.  Good times.  Then her youngest daughter quit breathing, turned blue and we left.    Now all packed up and not at all ready to drive back.  One week of school before the big push.  Not really worried too much, just trying to convince myself I really am prepared.    Then it'll be time to do it all over again, only this time we'll call it "Christmas."  How does Seattle sound, hon?  I know someone we can stay with.

      Morning, blogger!  So I just felt like writing a bit this morning, got a problem?  Left a few people outta my entry last night and decided to remedy that this morning.  Been perusing my email and other blogs to find people listing what they're thankful for and such.  Don't know that I need to go to such extremes, but we'll see where this goes, and it may just end up to be exactly that.    Received an email from my former Argonaut-editor-turned-lesbian-pal last night.  Ordinarily, such an event wouldn't be much to write home (or even a blog) about, but she doesn't do email.  Not that she's against it morally (you're not, are you?), it's just that it's never really been her mode of communicating.  She's a successful journalist, after all; she makes her living writing writing writing, and I can imagine that the idea of sitting down at the end of a day to write more just to keep in touch with long lost friends across the land would be a bit defeating.  Instead, she wrote from work.  Yay.  And it was such a nice surprise.  So I'm thankful for our chats in her old office and our October Starbucks gay pride sit-in.  Been thinking about my boy.  If you haven't already read on his fine blog, his dad's and step-mom's house is being pulled out from beneath them by the farm Mitch (that's his dad) has dedicated more than a few years' worth of blood, sweat and tears to.  Suppose it's situations (and days, tear!) like these that remind you to get a deal in writing and all, but fucking hell.  The company's given them til March to vacate, and anything could happen between now and then, but still.  Can't quite imagine walking through a house, knowing it's not yours anymore.  And really, if they've decided the folks needed to go in the first place, not sure much trust is being placed in the stability of the move-out date, either.  Could start in on all the "everything happens for a reason" stuff, but this is just shitty; there's no getting around it.  And maybe it is happening to make room for something else bigger and better, but for now, being pissed, hurt, shocked, etc. is allowed.  This could be the part where I say I'm thankful for my parents' house and home, that we can all gather here whenever we want and be secure in knowing that's never going to change.  But actually, with everything that's been thrown at each of us and our families (his more than mine) this and other years, I'm thankful that we'll always have the other to talk/shriek/sob about it with.  And if it all comes tumbling down around 2, we can always gas up the car and head to Jersey, the mixes blaring.  Okay, I think the rest will turn into a list, otherwise, I'll be here all damn day.  I'm thankful for:  Dave's smiles, warm and cheeky alike; wishing him a safe trip home and an even safer week with family;  Carrie's phone calls, messages, pep-talks, determination and perseverance;  Not having to use serial commas on break;  Lorraine;  Susan's refusal to banter with me at school;  Alycia's banter in and out of school;  The London Mixes; and  2003: the year of celebrities, signs and big damn changes.

      I can't seem to get enough rich, fried, salty foods today.  Gorged myself at Garcia's in IF today; seriously, those chips and salsa were worth staying another 10 minutes after they'd cleared the main meal's dishes.    Burned it off in the mall, though.  I never go shopping for myself in Moscow.  It honestly never occurs to me.  Get to make up for it here.  Yay.  Found some good stuff.  New shoes, new pants, new sweater and some promising ones sure to be under the tree in a month.  Decided, while Mom and I were admiring a new outfit due out later this winter, that I'm cutting my hair all off this summer.  Not shaved, dear god.  But I think it's time for a short, stylish, maybe even a bit dykey, but not butch, hairstyle.  And I've got 6 months to get used to the idea.  So yea, got home and had to hit the Pine Ridge Mall because it was only 5.  Whatever.  I called Carrie while Mom did JCPenny's.  Then on to Vicker's to secure Dad's present of 5-buckle goloshes.  I shit you not; it's what the man wants.  Got home just in time to catch the boys on their way to dinner.  I wasn't even hungry, but I've never been able to resist the smell of fresh grease and onions frying.  The butter on the toast was the same shit they drizzle on popcorn in movie theaters for fuck's sake!    Suppose I'm just getting ready for tomorrow.  Yea, sure, we'll go with that...

      Pretty full day today.    Had the annual teeth cleaning this morning at 9 am, which I was not too excited about, but at least I have a sparkling white grin now.  My dental hygenist was in a playful mood and that's always a good thing.  She's my friend Mike's mom, so we chatted about him and his adventures abroad in Ecuador.  He's supposed to teach his mom how to say "Shut the fuck up" in Spanish when he returns so she can throw down on the days her coworkers feel the need to belt out Tim McGraw tunes in the office.  Laurie's (that's  her name) good people, she knows I don't ever floss and doesn't judge me.    Then pounded out a three hour Torts practice exam, which I think I did pretty well on.  Yay.  Decided I deserved a break from studying around 3 and indulged in mid-day network programming.  Finally got off the couch around 930.  Yea, felt pretty guilty about not working on Property stuff, but not guilty enough to pull me away from back-to-back episodes of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy followed by Roseanne on Nick and Nite....god I miss cable!!!  But really, I haven't had a "just lay around watching bad day time TV" day in a long damn time and damnit...I deserved it!  Property can wait!  It's during the last week of finals, anyway.  Have to admit, though, did start feeling a bit zapped after awhile, and maybe a bit creatively blocked after not writing any pages at all for a day.    Was wondering how Amy would decide a case involving an Omish (?) girl's custody battle with the baby's "English" teenage father on CBS's riveting family court drama when Dad stopped by the couch to ask if I'd join him for a visit down at the grandparents' house.  Decided that was as good an excuse as any to get away from the machine's dangerous rays and went on down.  So yea, the old folks have decided to move into a newer, smaller place and I have very mixed feelings about the whole situation.  And by mixed I mean bad, sad and generally resentful.  Well okay, not resentful so much as already missing the old house next door to my elementary school.  I mean, it's Grandma's and Grandpa's House for crying out loud!!  This was the house I memorized my first book in!  How can we not be having Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners there anymore?  Thursday's will be the last official dinner in the homestead, so being there tonight was a good preparation for the big goodbye.  Regaled them with stories of meeting Justice Ginsburg this fall and the treacherous ride home last week.  Heard stories of young turkeys raised in the basement and barn, scouring the summer fields for choice grasshoppers, only to be slaughtered in the fall, and Peggy the cow with an amputated leg.    So tomorrow's the big shopping day with Mom.  Already fitting the armor and working out thoughtful, calm responses to anything and everything she may try to slip in under the radar.  Not sure if it'll come to blows, but I'm gonna be strong, by god!    Suppose I could use my favorite new line for situations such as these; used it on Dad tonight when he was grumbling about killing a stray cat on the grandparents' driveway.    "Right?" was his inevitable end to the mumbled tirade.  I simply said "I'm not engaging," and left it at that.

      Okay, I suppose it's time to do this.  Have the house to myself for a couple more hours and have been working hard on studying all day, so I deserve this break.  Figured it's as good an opportunity as any to start filling in some gaps and clarifying some statements/allusions/what have you.    It's been a bit odd being back this time, the journey and luggage issues aside.  And I'm not even going to pretend to wonder why.  I know it's because I'm not talking to Lorraine.  Realized while on the phone with Levi that this is the first time in 6-ish years we haven't spoken on a daily basis.  Suppose it was bound to hit sooner or later.  Everything here reminds me of what it was like when we both lived in the same town.  Knowing she's an hour away is another thought to be pushed away, along with how easy it would be to just say "Happy Thanksgiving" or "Made it home safe."  So let's back up a bit, shall we?  Lorraine is...well, she's Lorraine.  Simply put, she was my first, and as yet only, love.  She's my best friend, my pal, my goofing-off buddy.  We go fishing and laugh big laughs.  She's the closest thing to a soulmate I've ever met.  So why aren't we together in as-wedded-as-we-can-get bliss?  Well, circumstances, mostly.  Such a lousy excuse, I realize.  But we both made choices and must now abide by them.  Basically, neither of us were willing to cut off our relationships with our families to ride off into the sunset together.  She was also my first relationship, and there was always a part of me that wanted to explore more....normal dating situations, not wanting my life to be consumed by a shroud of secrecy and/or isolation.  So, while we were together, it was kept secret to protect her from public shaming and me from public institutionalizing.  And we pulled it off for a long time, while living in the same town and, later, when the entire state separated us.    Soon enough, however, it was time to reexamine the situation.  My brother would soon be joining me at school and as much as I wanted to start traveling to a mid-way point for secret monthly trysts, I didn't.  So, something had to end.  We told ourselves it wouldn't really be an end...more of a change, really.  And as of August 11, 2002, the change began...only not.  We still spoke everyday, in the way lovers do, and things carried on as they always had, only without the visits.    Then, in the Spring of 2003, she met someone:  Jan.    Before you jump to conclusions, it should be stressed that I was (and am) very very happy for her.  For years, she convinced herself that should our relationship ever end, I would find love quickly and just as quickly forget all about her.  But as it turned out, she found someone who made her happy.  A Mormon housewife with 3 kids and one grandchild, but still.  I expected things between us to change further, but Lorraine was adamant about not letting her new love drive a wedge between she and I.  I was still her best friend, and woe be unto anyone who asked her to part with that.  So, after more than a few conversations and one group meeting, we all were on the same page...kinda.  You see, Lorraine and I never really got around to figuring out how our relationship really ended.  We just kinda went along, doing what we always did, knowing it was "different" but not really changing anything in our ordinary course of dealing with each other to reflect that difference.  So it was bound to happen, when she visited (alone) in July 2003, that we'd blur the lines more than a bit.  And sure enough, I was left feeling incredibly guilty and not knowing what our "re-connection" meant for our friendship.  But, we worked through it and again, nothing changed in our daily discourse.  Well, nothing except for the fact that she couldn't seem to talk to me with Jan under the same roof.    As more time passed, and dealing with the reality staring me in the face kept going undone, I grew more and more frustrated with the feeling that I was nothing more than an obligation...something she checked off her list at the end of each night.  All for the sake of maintaining the last contact our friendship still afforded us.  All the while, I never resented the new girl or their life together..honestly.  I merely resented the fact that I was now a supporting character.    As a last-ditch effort to gain some clarity/perspective on the issue, I consulted a couple of wise lesbian sages for their advice.  My own approach to giving advice came back to haunt me as they told me exactly what the problem was without pausing and without reservation.  I wasn't getting over her.  I wasn't moving on.  And I wasn't being reasonable in my expectations that everything could continue smoothly from one relationship's manifestation to another.  There was only one solution: get over her, move on from our relationship, and do it alone.  Only when I no longer needed/depended on connecting with her on a regular (not even daily) basis should I attempt to maintain a friendship with her.    So that's where we are now.  It's been about a week and a half since The Conversation and as you can tell how it's gone from the previous entries in this blog.  Some days are easier than others.    She emailed me yesterday.  It was a forward of a cheezy Thanksgiving joke-picture, but an email nonetheless.  Had it reached me during a time of strength and resolve, I probably would've smiled and moved on to other things.  But it didn't arrive during a time of strength and resolve, and as you can tell, I haven't entirely moved on to other things.  The feeling of guilt for not responding has passed, but I'm just thinking about her more than ever now.    Big Sigh.  So yea, not a new story for some of you, and perhaps an enlightening one for others.

      The plan was to leave town as soon as my Civil Procedure class let out.  Probably around 1, but perhaps a bit earlier, depending on the questions asked during the review session.  It snowed the night before, but that was nothing new; it always snows the night before I leave Moscow.  And sure enough, the snow was melting and the sun was out when I blew out of town just after 1.    Made it to Coeur d'Alene just after 230 to find gray, doomsday clouds and a sheet of ice masquerading as a highway waiting for me.   "Should be fine."  The slush and snow from the night's storm had frozen to the road nicely.    "So I won't get there till 11...it'll be okay.  I'm going to make it, by god!"  An hour and a half and 40 miles later, I admitted defeat, at least for the night.  Got a nice, cozy, $70 room at the Wallace Best Western and tried to relax.  Fought the urge to call Lorraine (we'll get to her later), and found comfort with the Golden Girls instead.    Not so bright and early the next morning I stoically folded back into my trusty steed and made my way over the mountain.  The roads didn't actually clear up until Missoula, and I was still trying to convince myself that I could make it to Bozeman at a respectable hour.  "Okay, it's only 11.  If all goes well, I could be there by 2.  That's practically a whole day; plus we'll have Sunday, too."  And for the most part, it did go well.  The wet roads were fine, until I remembered that it was 20 degrees outside and if they were wet, they could just as easily be icy.  But damnit, I'd made a plan and fuck if the goddamned weather was going to cheat me out of it!!  Kept thinking about arriving and falling into Levi's couch, drinking tea or something stronger, and maybe taking our relationship to the next level.    But home was sounding pretty good, too.  Could sleep in my cave, have time to lay around before hitting the outlines and practice exams next week.  But no!  That's not what was supposed to happen!  I'm supposed to be in Bozeman!  That's where I'm going!  Don't try to stop me!    "You could have two entire days to yourself to get prepared."  "SHUT UP!  I want to see my boyfriend!"  "And get back in the car Monday morning..."  "I can study Monday afternoon!"  "After driving half the day?"  "If I have to!!  See..here's the turn off, I'm going to Butte!  I'll show you what I want!"  So I went.  And halfway through the town, I realized I'd be bad news.  Just thinking about how much time we lost, what all we could've done but would be impossible now.  IMPOSSIBLE!  And if I did get home Monday, I knew I wouldn't do any work and I'd just be pissesd at myself all week for not doing what I knew I should...even though I didn't want to.     The fucking practical side won out again...damnit!    And today, I'm sooo glad it did.

      It never fails.  Usually within a day or so of my arrival back home, Mom and I go on an excursion during which she reminds me of something.  Still can't quite define what that something is, but it's along the lines of: "You're not good enough/You're not what I expected and I resent that/You're not in charge here/You don't get to be you here."  I'm sure I'm being completely overdramatic, but jesus fucking christ!  And it always happens while we're shopping and I won't let her buy me something I don't like/want/need.   Today it was in TJ Maxx.  For some damn reason she's on this luggage kick.  Has been since last year.  I have two fucking sets of luggage, but I need a middle size.  She was on it last year because I was traveling to London, at least there was some context.  But it was there again this year...whatever.  So, of course, I very gently tried to tell her that no, I still don't need another piece of luggage.   "You always say that," she said, as if I was deliberately trying to ruin her fun. "Well, it never changes," I replied, trying to explain why I still don't need it, and trying to figure out what the hell this was about, not thinking it was a big deal. She sighed, walked away and said over her shoulder: "I can see shopping with you is going to be sooo fun....like always."  As though I'd just insulted her.  I couldn't believe it.  "Ditto/Excuse me?!/What does that mean?"  All ran through my head at the same moment, but I couldn't get any of them out.  Instead, I just sealed myself off and followed her to the sock section where I picked out three new pair.   Then we didn't really talk for the rest of the outing.  We drove by the new house my grandparents bought, talked about what a mess that is and all, but we weren't really talking.  Still aren't.    WHAT THE FUCK???  It's never been any different.  And I know one of these times one of us will say something, but good fucking god, I just wish I knew what the damn deal is.

      So, just printed off a ream of paper in preparation for the big study session that is Thanksgiving Break.  Got some nice little practice exams raring to go.  Super!    And since I know you're reading this, study-pal, I know I said I'd print off copies for you too, but the Property exam alone's 17 damn pages, so you'll just have to use the allotment from the school, sorry.    So think I'll be going to this little discussion later about "What Women Want" because, you know, I should get that figured out at some point.  And if the interim director of the Chick's Center wants to hit on me while I'm there, that could be fun, too.  Should be good for another blog entry at least....

      A TEAM!  And what's a team??  T ogether  E veryone A chieves M ore  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yes, that is how I was introduced to one of my good friends, Ms. Carrie "Shut the Fuck Up" Johnson. As you can tell by her name, that Pollyana attitude went to the way-side eventually, but we still like to bring it up every once in a while.   So now that she's been introduced, you'll probably be hearing more about her in the entries to follow.  Here's the cliff notes on her story thus far:   Fate brought us together at the University of Idaho Queer Student Association and allowed us to continue our blossoming friendship at the University's Library, where, over the following years, great trials and tribulations came to pass.  But, we persevered and have lived to tell the tale.   This summer, Ms. Johnson (aka Anastasia Beaverhausen), up and decided that she was tired of this side of the continent and needed to make her way across the country to live in Boston, Mass.   And, by god, she pulled it off!  YAY!  GO CARRIE! Today she begins a new job in that fair city as a crusading social worker, saving down and out citizens from the evils of the world around them by day, saving her evenings for the Jack & Karen hour.  (That's code for Will & Grace:  it's not about Jack or Karen, and it's not an hour, but it's the Jack & Karen hour.)  So, there you have it.    Congratulations on the new job, sweetie pie.  I know you'll do great things.  And if anyone gives you any guff, just have them call your attorney who also dispenses medical advice.

      Hello out there to any new readers jumping over from Levi's blog!  I find it interesting that his was the "private" blog, but it already has a fan-base following it regularly.  Sigh.  Probably has something to do with all that damn charm of his.  At any rate, thanks for the plug hon!  So, it occurred to me that I've been making regular posts alluding to the process of studying for my first semester law school finals, but I haven't actually described what that process (or its significance in the great, wide realm of general understanding) really consists of.  And whether or not anyone's curious, here's the low-down:  Pretty much everyone knows that grades in law school are made up entirely of one (1) exam.  The final.  No quizzes, no assignments, just the final.  Each final's length is determined by the class' credit hours.  One hour of exam-time for each credit hour.  So, a three credit class has a three hour exam.  I've got 4, 3 credit classes, so that makes for 12 hours of exam time.  Yay.   The process leading up to those 12 hours has, thus-far, been an interesting one, I have to say.  The most prevalent study method is outlining.  Basically, students outline their classes and study that sucker up until and including the minute before the exam begins.  Now, at first, I thought outlining wouldn't be too difficult an undertaking.  After all, it's just a matter of organizing information...not a problem for one who LOVES to organize.  And really, it's not "hard" per se, more just hugely overwhelming.  Imagine it...4 months worth of class notes/concepts/theories to get properly arranged in learnable fashion, several of which may or may not have been forgotten around Labor Day weekend.    Only after that's begun does the real fun/actual work begin.  You see, it's not enough to simply know the words and what they mean.  No, there's this little thing called "application" that's actually a pretty big deal around here, shockingly enough.  I mean, sure, I can rattle off the requirements for a remainder in Property, or the Duty/Breach analyses in Torts, or the Parol Evidence Rule for Contracts, but that does shit on an exam.  The name of the game there is: hypotheticals.   An example:  Defendant places white, granular rat poison in an unlabeled can near a coffee pot sitting on a hot plate.  (Why is this a careless, negligent thing to do?  What harm could/should be expected?)  No one (including defendant) knows the rat poison is flammable.  It blows up and physically injures plaintiff standing by the hot plate to pour himself some coffee.   Did the defendant proximately cause plaintiff's injuries?  Should defendant be liable?    That could be a short-answer question, or it could be the basis of an entire final Torts exam, depending.    Similarly,  To A for life, then to B and her heirs To A for life, then to B and the heirs of her body To A for life, then to B if B is 21 before A dies; B is 15 To A for life, then to B and her heirs is B survives A, and if B does not survive A to C and his heirs To A for life, then to B and her heirs, but if B does not survive A, to C and his heirs Are all grants of property, after which the question will inevitably be: what is the state of the title?  Now, all of this is not, in any way, meant to conjure sympathy, pity, wonder or awe...although if you feel the need to express any of those through monetary donations or physical affection, feel free. Instead, it's meant to just give a little glimpse into life as it is for me at the moment, which, I suppose, is the whole point to a blog in the first place.  Jealous? I know it doesn't look like loads of fun on the surface, but really, it's a great time.  Just hope I can remember that in the coming weeks... And now, I shall return to work:  Contracts reading for tomorrow's class.  Yes, in the midst of all this action, we are still learning more material that will of course be included on the final.   Sigh... The drive on Friday will feel good.

      hi bloggy! actually pretty tired from another action-packed full day, but still wanted to post a little something that wasn't just a cryptic one-liner, so we'll see how it goes.  so the new Tori collection's out today.  i have to say, i was under the impression most (if not all) the songs included would be re-worked, if not entirely, at least noticeably.  apparently that's not the case; so yea, basically, it's $17 for 2 new songs, 2 re-recorded ones and 4 live sound-check performances.  not a bad deal, but still.  the packaging's great, though.  think she must have been too busy on her 13 month epic tour to care a great deal about her last contractual obligation to Atlantic to re-work all 20 songs, sigh!   but the journal entry/poem was a nice touch; she's in London tonight honey!    the cold's pretty much vacated my throat and is beginning to lodge in my chest/lung region.  yay.  still determined to beat it with vitamin C tablets and water, but i may have to break down and go on a NyQuill run before i leave town.   sooooo....not a whole lot to mention, really.  suppose i could take suggestions if anyone has any.

      I LOVE NEW MIXES!!!!  Seriously, there's nothing else like 'em.  Especially when your best friend in all the world makes them.  Honestly, he makes the best mixes around.  Can't wait to get into the car and drive with the November Mix.  Yes, we name our mixes after months; got a problem??  We do seasons too!  Good god, such a great one hon!  Who knew Dido was so great?   WHO??  Tired to listen to the Tori B-Sides mix, but only got to the 3rd song before I had to just shove November back in.  Currently on "When You're Stoned"...it's my instant favorite.  Seriously jumped when her voice started after the great instrumental background.  And then fucking "Honey" after that...WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH YOU???? And as for "Love Him".....GGGGRRRRRRRRR!!!!!! Have to say, hearing the Cranberries' "Can't be with You" on the mix was kinda bittersweet.  Recognized the intro immediately, but for the life of me couldn't figure out what the hell it was.   Once the lyrics began, I was back in my old room in the mountain fortress, 14, on the blue carpet playing UNO with Tracy.  Oh yea.   To be followed by only Madonna song that makes me feel like I'm Seattle in summer just as much as "Hollywood." So basically, the whole damn things rocks the cock all the way to the moon, honey.  Really.   And I didn't intend this entry to so closely resemble an email, but what the hell?  And yes, Track 9 totally knocked me down.  Sniff!

      Circles! Just about to pack it on outta here; put in a full day and feel pretty damn good about it.  Feelings pretty much going in the opposite direction they were when I arrived, and we love that.  Think my productivity has a lot to do with it.  This morning saw work/duties/responsibilities piling up, landing squarely on my shoulders (sob!), and this evening has that load lessened and manageable...KICK ASS!   And the only way to celebrate is to go home and do a little bit more!   ...Might have a little package waiting for me, too...I dunno! Till next time; over and out.

      As I was coming out of the haze of Contracts reading, my desk-mate pulled out the chair next to me and said he'd been chatting with a gal from my class who, when he told her who his desk-mate was, said: "Ah, the smart one from our class."  There are others among us I would more readily describe that way, but still; it was nice to hear.

      The phone rang around 8.  My heart stopped beating and when it resumed, it was in my mouth, and I couldn't breathe.  No one calls me at 8.  Almost no one.  Something had to be wrong for her to call.  And in spite of the pep-talks and three pages of writing I'd just done on the subject, I desperately wanted it to be her.  It was my brother.  He needed my plunger. After he left, I couldn't escape that feeling.  The feeling that this is going to take longer than a few weeks.  The feeling that this is going to be harder than just fighting off the urge to call to check in.  Then that damn "Only Freshmen" song came on and I had no choice but to turn it up.   Got to school nice and early on account of not having Property class this morning.  Double checked my citations in the infamous paper and discovered two were wrong.  Not to fear, I'd brought a back-up disk.  Funny thing:  12 pages in Word Perfect equals 12 pages and 3 lines in Word. It should be mentioned that I got perhaps 6 hours of interrupted sleep last night and am feeling a bit jittery from the combination of coffee and cough syrup.   After trimming and fighting with the Insert Page Number feature of that wonderful word processing program, I finally turned in the paper I've had done since goddamned Saturday.  Thought I could collect myself at my computer, read a blog or two, get geared up for the big week before the big break before the big finals.  Starting to feel the pressure/stress/nerves of those exams.  Feeling like I've got 3 weeks to pull 4 months' worth of material together into a congizable form.  It's probably just the usual cold-induced emotional wax/wane thing.   And then I felt like a self-indulgent shit when I read Dave's blog.  Dave, I'm sorry.  There's really nothing else I can think of to say, except that I'm sending you thoughts of strength, comfort and love.  ...And it's not even 10 a.m.

      Property's fun.  You wouldn't think it to hear the course title.  "What do they mean, 'property'?  Like what's 'ownership'?  They just going to teach us what kind of possession we have over inanimate objects/land/other human beings?  What kind of sick twisted shit is THAT?"   As it turns out, it's actually quite interesting, complicated, frustrating, at-times incomprehensible, and an organizational nightmare that I'll have conquered very soon because I have no choice.   Recent topics organized/consolidated into outline (study-able) form:  Future Interests :  Retained by transferor : a.Reversion: when the quantum of the estate given is less than whole, retained by grantor b.Possibility of reverter c.Right of reentry   Retained by transferee : a.Vested remainder b.Contingent remainder c.Executory interest   Remainder : any future interest created in a transferee that can (IS CAPABLE OF) become a present possessory interest immediately upon (BUT NO SOONER THAN) the expiration of prior interests simultaneously created and which cannot divest (cut short) any interest other than the future interest in the transferor.  Vested Remainder : receiving party is presently identified and known (ascertained at the time), and only natural expiration of all prior estates created with it is needed for it to become possessory; it’s NOT subject to any condition precedent  Contingent Remainder : identity of receiving party unknown and  interest is subject to a condition precedent, something must happen before the interest vests other than the natural expiration of all prior estates   Sigh...  Life is good...

      Morning, blogger I can still say that, since there's 42 minutes left before noon.  I should be getting my ass to school to study study study for finals, but I just want to sit on my stylish futon and watching bad but good movies all day.  Plus, I'm getting sick.  Yes, the first tell-tale tickles of a sore throat started yesterday, and this morning the sinuses are starting to join the party.  Yay. At least this week's an easier....well, let's just say lighter....week than last.  And the Thanksgiving vacation begins Friday at 1, so there's that too. But I just had to write a little something this morning because I was inspired by my boyfriend's new-born blog.  HI HONEY!!!  Suppose you all should get used to hearing about him.  His name's Levi, but I may refer to him at any time as "the boy," "that guy," "my guy," "my boyfriend," or "the Jew" (because he's not).  And really, he's not my boyfriend either, but that's part of the joke, get it? Alrighty...I'll be plodding along now...have to see about changing the body text color on this damn thing to make it easier for some pansy-asses to read!

      I'll tell you how:  By thinking like a journalist.    Suppose that journalism degree will come in handy, after all.    Yes, managed to edit that sucker down to 11.5 pages, only to be faced with 4/5 of a page of case citations....GRRRRRRRR!  But, another editing pass ended in a successful page count of exactly 12, with not a single line to spare...ahhhhh.  As you were...

      Hi blogger! So, it took me a minute to figure out how to post another damn entry on this confounded thing; but, through perseverance and a bit of common sense, I managed to do okay...sigh! I'm thinking this might be the perfect little supplement/substitute for my daily, morning pages I write during the week.  For whatever reason, I didn't feel like coming home (from Yoga class, we'll get to that in a minute), sitting down at my kitchen table and writing three pages long-hand in my trusty notebook as is usually the case every weekday morning (except for most Fridays).  BUT...logging on and posting a blog sound just great!  Whatever. It's probably the "newness" of the whole thing, or maybe a hint of excitement at joining the celebrity list of those with blogs...I dunno. Anyway, had a nice yoga practice this morning.  Not a fan of getting up at eight on Saturdays, but for a bit of breathing, stretching and lunging, I make do.  Found a new coffee place on the way home, too, which we totally love.  But back to yoga for a sec...basically, it rocks the mullet all the way to Texas.  And that's all there is to it.  Can't get that "looking up.." line outta my head, either.  My usual instructor said it in class last week as she was teaching us a new pose.  Not sure how the description will work out on here, but we'll give it a go.  Just think about the position you usually take when you're about to do push-ups or lower yourself down onto some lucky person beneath you...now, imagine shifting your weight onto one hand and opening your body to the side with one hand on the hip you're lifting away from the floor.  Okay, NOW, imagine lifting that hand up toward the ceiling.  So we've got our legs straight...I mean RIGHT out in front of us, and one hand supporting the whole body while the other's lifted toward the ceiling.  Fun, huh?  Actually, there's a modified version, but I'm not going to explain it on here, so deal.  Anyway, once the balance is found (gasp!) the finishing touch is to lift the head up to look at the raised hand.  And that usually obliterates the balance that was tentative to begin with.   So yea, looking up changes everything. Nice little mantra for other stuff, too, I imagine.   Wonder how these little pages of blog-wonder compare with notebook pages...hmmm.  Doubt I've typed as much as three pages would be written, but still...feels like more than the usual morning pages amount.  Suppose I could explain those...they're really quite self-explanatory, but if it'll add more type to the entry, I'm all for it.  Basically, morning pages are written in the middle of the night, right after you fall into a deep, relaxing slumber.  Then you jolt yourself awake and write everything you were thinking about right before you fell asleep, along with whatever luscious dreams you were about to have, were it not for your obligation to write these damn pages.  Kick ass, huh?  It's great for self-examination and personal growth. Alrighty....I could keep rambling, but I know you're all busy souls with things to do and places to be and I refuse to let you use my blog as a procrastination device any longer! Besides, I've got to be a brilliant law student today and I need time to prepare myself for the job.  A shower seems like the best place to start....

I guess we'll give this a go; suppose I should acknowledge my blogger-mentor, David Jack, first and foremost, as his little suggestion that I start a blog of my own tilted me over the "I wonder if  I  should start a blog" cliff I'd been teetering on.  Yay Dave! So yea, here we are kids, hope it lives up to all the hype....

      We're trapped in the mountain fortress for yet another day.  It's been surprisingly nice.  Usually, we find ourselves feeling incredibly guilty for spending hours (if not days) on end doing nothing more than showering and eating during a day's passing.  But now that we're forced to do just that because of the several feet of snow in the driveway and the continually non-plowed streets of town.  Soon we may have to start eating each other to survive.  That'll show 'em who's boss.  Made it out to see Cold Mountain yesterday then spent the evening finishing the last 100 pages of the book.  Think I'll have to see it again before I deliver my final verdict.  Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but the book will always have my heart.  The three main characters translated beautifully to screen, but the remaining supporting roles were trimmed significantly to fit the movie, which left me a bit miffed.  The gals shared a kiss, though, and we love that, Civil War be damned!  Today's only possible outing will be to dinner with Levi's aunt and uncle.  Yay.  They're good people.  Plus they have a hot tub.  Spent a while at their place the afternoon leading up to the night of gay dancing glory.  His aunt's a bigger, brasher, funnier-in-a-different-way version of his mom.  Good damn times.  So mexican food and margaritas with them sounds like a good excuse to risk our lives on the streets of this frozen city.    The boy says I should write about how much fun we're having.  We're having so much fun.  I'm starting to dread his leaving a wee bit.  But if the weather keeps up this shit, he won't be able to leave and he will be mine.  He will be my squishy.  That's my teapot's name, by the way.  Got it for my birthday, so excited.  No more of the microwaved brew for me!  Received my first lawyer-to-be power suit, too.  It's so intimidating, I'm even scared to put it on.  But I'm supposed to be telling you about all the frolicking we've been doing, sorry!    We've been doing Yoga like no other!    "Let's just do some stretches."   "Okay!"   Cut to an hour later.    "And this is where you put your hand on the sky and lift your ankle across the room to the mirror before breathing out of your ear!  Let's go!  Two on each side!  Remember to breathe and lift up through the heart!  Change the CD while you're over there, will you?"    We're so limber.    Listening to the Madonna mix now, remembering the other night at Charley's, missing Seattle, and loving being forced to relax.

      Especially ones that go on for weeks.  Getting pretty cozy indeed with all this free time.  Been recovering today from last night's exertions, I'll get to those in a minute.  It's been a few days since my last post, so I'll just take the days one at a time, m'kay?    Friday, December 26  The big birthday.  Yay!  Mom woke me around 9 to wish me a happy day and to tell me we had a big blizzard raging outside.  I knew when the Boy said he'd drive from Twin Falls unless a storm broke, there'd be a storm.  So we waited for the phone to ring.  After much warring, he decided to take the plunge.  The only way Mom and I could make good use of the 3 feet of snow was to go to town.  No force of nature was going to keep us from TJ Maxx, by god!  Couldn't get back up the driveway, even in the big truck, and as we left the men to dig and pull it out, the Boy called to let us know he'd made it to town, if a bit shaken up by the treacherous road behind him.  We finally got the driveway plowed, and the Boy picked up, and there was much rejoicing.  No partying was done, however, until the next night, but the obligatory candles, cake and ice cream were not overlooked.  Remember how I said The Phone Call would be happening soon?  Yea, well, it turned out to be my birthday present to myself.  Was worried she wouldn't be home and I'd have to decide whether or not to leave a message.  But she saved me from that dilemma by answering on the 4th ring.  She had bronchitis and didn't sound like herself.  It was different and the same.  Finally laughed a bit at the end, which felt good.  There will be a period of adjustment, that much is clear.  But whatever happens now, I know I'm ready for and can handle it.  Gave her the address for this blog; everybody wave.      Saturday, December 27  Regaled Mom with the high points of Crazy Aunt Karen's reply email, and she in turn regaled Levi and me with stories about the old broad.  It was decided by some unspoken agreement that he and I would not be caged in this house any longer, and we made our way into the bright, blue, white wonderland.  It was to be the only break from a string of storms continuing today, and we were not about to watch it from the living room.  Met up with Natty-poo and her world-traveling English teacher mother for a few good fondles.  Then on to dinner with the entire fam.  Yay.  Joe worked his magic one-liners on Nat as they played When a Man Loves a Woman for the 6th time.    The three of us at last descended on the only gay bar in town, for a few drinks to begin with before moving on to other scenes.  Found a drag show waiting for us, however, and ended up staying until 2.  Levi caught the eye of a cute waiter and we didn't pay for another drink the rest of the evening.  Good times.  We drank, vogued, and were forever young all night.    So yea, recovering from it all today.  Just finished X-Men 2, and might curl up with a little booky in a minute, I dunno!    Lazy days are our friends.

      Merry Christmas, blogger!  In two hours the house will be not all that filled with family and flowing wine.  The Grandparents as well as Uncle Jim and Aunt Amy are joining us for the first Christmas dinner in our house; should be a good time.  For now, though, the fam's settling in with the new prezzies, Mom's trying to keep dinner under control and I'm hiding in my cave to reflect on it all.  Snowed all night and this morning the sun's breaking through the leftover clouds.  Yay.    Just read the Boy's sentimental Christmas Eve entry and am feeling a bit fuzzy myself.  Started last night with the home movies.  Joe's first Christmas was the best.  Between watching him spit up, tip over Mom's coffee, follow the table knife around the old living room, and me screeching at each new wrapped wonder set before me, the whole thing was just the right amount of too much.  He actually was a cute damn baby; too bad I was too young to stop tormenting him to notice.  Had a few glasses of Merlot over at the New House.  Listened to Grandpa tell us about all his vintage Marilyn Monroe paraphenalia.  He has an original, life-size poster of her, the original first issue of Playboy featuring her features on the cover, and the box of candy bearing her first commercial image.  Told him he could get more money for those three things than he did for his house.  He sold six boxes of vintage National Geographics for $100.  I prefer not to think about it.  Hopefully we'll (and by "we" I mean "I") get our hands on his pop culture relics before anyone else.  But it was nice to sit with them, helping them not be so lonely on their first Christmas Eve in 43 years outside their home.    Looking forward to tomorrow.  And the next day.  There's nothing like spending lazy days on end with your best friend.  We haven't done it for about three years, so it's only fitting it happens here again.  Major revelations and unbreakable connections were make back then; can't wait to see what happens this round.  It's really the wrong day, date-wise, for this little passage, but it's just the mood I'm in today, okay?    ...the day did come when they were both bored with each otherÃƒÂ‚&#146;s respective homes and sought external entertainment.  They visited their old stomping grounds, checking in with favorite teachers and restaurants, but soon they were looking for something else to fill their day.  Neither wanted to part ways, but neither knew what to else do.    "Well, you wanna get some coffee?" he asked. "And I imagine we have to get you a mocha, right?"  "Damn right.  Just deal."  He was restless as he stirred in his cream and sugar:  "I don't really feel like sitting here and flipping through magazines."  "Ummm, okay ..." she carefully sipped her drink, deciding.  "You wanna go for a drive around the winter wilderness?  Go admire the harsh beauty of it all?"  "Hmmm ... harsh beauty ... that sounds good."  This was something she had yet to share with him: random, lazy drives.  And something told her this would be an important one.  It called for a special route.  "So, where you taking me?"  His raised voice asked over the music as she took them into the mountains.  "Oh, just in a big loop," she answered coyly. "We'll come to a point in a while where we'll have to decide if we want to come back right away or keep going."  It was a perfect day for either choice.  By the time they reached the first peak and descended upon the rolling countryside, the sun had emerged, making January's latest snowfall impossibly bright, accentuated further by the baby blue sky.    They let silence stand between them; let the music fill the emptiness, simply enjoying being in each other's presence.    Over the past few months, they'd discovered the wonder of wordplay.  Their favorite toys were the truly offensive, derogatory-if-spoken-by-anyone-else types.    "Why do you have to be so damn gay all the time?" was a staple.  "Stupid fags, I swear!" was another.    They were a damn riot.  Just ask them.    So when he turned to her and said, "So, you've been waiting for me to come out, have you?"  she jumped right on the joke-train and answered, "Yeah, that's right.  Enough fucking around, it's time to admit it to yourself and everybody else," laughing all the while.  "Okay, well ... I'm gay."  "Oh really?" she laughed.  "Really."  "Well, that's just super!  Tell me, how long have you known?"  She continued to question him and mock his answers, never once believing he was serious.  But soon she realized he wasn't laughing with her.  And her stomach hit the floor.  "Are you serious?"  "I'm totally serious."  "No, really.  Are you really fucking serious?"  "Really, I'm really fucking serious."  She pulled the car over, hoping he would start laughing or just say "Gotcha!"   "Okay, really.  Are you serious?  Because either you're kidding or I'm a huge fucking asshole."  "Well, then you're an asshole because I'm not joking."  Shaking, she pulled the car back onto the road.  She asked him the same questions over again, this time mulling over the answers, trying to pull herself together to be the best friend she'd  considered herself to be this past year.  "I can't believe you're this surprised," he said.     "Well, I honestly have never thought about it.  I already know I have no gaydar, so that's no surprise.  When people in high school used to say, you know, 'Levi's so gay, just look at him,' I would be like: 'Oh come on you guys, he really isn't.  Trust me, I know him pretty well.  And even if he is, he has no idea.'"  "I really didn't back then."  They took the long way home that day.     Their AP English teacher once prophesied: "You two will know each other's grandchildren."  It may have been a nice sentiment at first, but after the day of harsh beauty, it quickly became a promise.  The winter break continued much the same way, only with a few more hugs and arms around each other's waists.     Big sigh.  So, I think the phone call will happen soon.  Found myself thinking of opportunities last night.  When I have the house to myself for an extended period of time, etc.  Don't want to make it on a tempermental cell phone in a semi-public setting.  The best place and time is probably in the Moscow apartment upon my safe return.  Just don't know that I want to wait that long, though.  Wonder if that's a red flag all by itself.  Finally feel ready to do it.  Enjoyed the break and all, and am enjoying the knowledge that they can be taken whenever the need arises.  Might be a nice little Christmas present to us both.  Think I'll email Crazy Aunt Karen now.  She included her address in her card this year; apparently I'm the only member of the family she's cared to invite contact from.  Must have been all those Thank-You cards through the years.  Hmmm.  This could be interesting, indeed.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  Love you all; if I can't say it to each of you, know that I'm thinking of you and wishing you the best.

      Evening bloggy!  Happy Christmas Eve!  Can't believe it's here again.  Last year at this time we were down at Grandma and Grandpa's, throwing back a few egg nogs, admiring the shaggy carpet we were beginning to miss but didn't know why and trying to make my passport appear in the mailbox two days later.  I had plane to catch on the 27th, after all.    Spent the day seeing Return of the King again.  All else feels so insignificant when you come out of the theater after that one.  Cried a bit again, although no where near as much as the first time.  Made it though the first hour of the first viewing just dry heaving and the next two in wrenching sobs.  Dad will be home from worky soon; might venture out again, as a family, to another movie.  Not sure how I feel about visiting the same theater in the same day, but it's Christmas and there might be a chance of catching some naked Diane Keaton action...PARTY!    Talked to Natalie earlier today.  She's so damn cute and funny and hot.  And that's just over the phone!  She's the only gal from high school I still try (I should try harder, I realize, and I make no excuses) to track down whenever I'm in town.  I watched her performance in Highland's Dracula production in awe (and a wee bit of attraction), and nearly swooned when Levi brought her to the Mountain Fortress Get-Together the eve of the last day of junior year.  "Your bathroom is bigger than the blue banana!" she said as she made her way through the house at her own pace, and we haven't looked back since.  Imagined her zipping all over town in her new VW Golf without a care or worry about carbon monoxide in the world.  Forgot to ask her what she named her new charge.  If she hasn't named it yet, I think it should be called Gimli.  Not sure why.  She's coming out with the Boy and me to help celebrate my birthday Friday.  Should be nothing less than a sweaty, sticky, drunken good time.  Haven't seen her since this summer, but I know we'll all pick up right where we left off.  That's what's so great about her, really.  No matter where you've been or what you've done, when you're together again, it always feels like you never were apart.

      So I spent my entire shower coming up with a great way to tell the story of lunch with Mom, The Boy and the hot gay waiter in Idaho Falls.  Had a opening and thought the rest would flow easily.  Finally made it to the computer, checked out the other bloggies of note only to find the Boy's own rendition of the incident on his blog.  Well, never being one to compete with greatness, I just copied and pasted the story from his.  Without permission, of course.  (Editor's note: the "S"s originally in my mom's name on Levi's blog have been changed to "C"s.)   Andrea's mom is a golden piece of work. A source of endless humor and entertainment without even knowing it. She can say things like "Looks like you just shot your wad!" without a clue of its sexual implications. That's precisely what we love about her. Our lunch was stacked with brilliant moments where Andrea and I were convulsing in hysterics and poor Cheryl was just wishing she could go sit at another table. "You damn kids..."   I can't wait to spend a week with her.   We all met at a crowded Johnny Carino's in Idaho Falls, waiting in the lobby with the herds of Mormon families lumbering their offspring in and out of carriers and over shoulders. There's no place like southern Idaho.  "If I had known it would be like this, I would have picked somewhere different." "Oh, like a place where they forbid children?" Not likely, in this state.   The girl and I haven't seen each other in nearly 3 months and our first words are to tell each other how damn hot we both look. And really, we're each at the top of our game and loving every damn second of it. She's let her hair grow into layered, shaggy fronds (very sexy), where I've chopped my locks for a slightly cleaner, sharper look which I've come to prefer, set off by my scruffy cheeks. She in her leather and I in my wool, we'd be all over each other if we both weren't gay...and sometimes we don't even let that stop us.   The event begins with an innocent vibrator joke from Cheryl when the buzzer tells us our table is ready...to be followed by Andrea's comment of: "I don't pack mine out of the house, mother!" and it pretty much grew from there. Things got better when our waiter revealed himself...no doubt in any of our minds on which side he liked his bread buttered. Something needed to be said, but how? Cheryl had only recently learned of my own leanings (which is a great tale in itself) and I wasn't really sure how we'd be dealing with the topic.   "What is it with Johnny Carino's?" Andrea's always great with openings.  "God, I know...it's like a secret brotherhood or something. But he's probably just a Mormon."  "Wouldn't be surprised, with that hair."  Cut to Cheryl shaking her head in disbelief, mumbling something like "you kids are terrible." but knowing deep down she adored our irreverence. She couldn't help bring up last year's Passport debacle, which is always good for a laugh or two. We get a glimpse of the hidden Cheryl, dark and saucy and wild. She could be unstoppable if only she would let herself.   Rather than help Cheryl pick out a watch for Christmas, the girl and I ditched her for our obligatory coffee-talk. I drove her back to her mountain fortress in Pocatello and didn't want to leave. We have so much to catch up on! So much to do and say and laugh about! (Like her mom!) But I had to forge onward...with the promise that I'd return bright and early on her birthday, to continue our adventure. I always leave her with the thought, "Remind me again why we don't live in the same town? why did we choose to do this the hard way?"   Good times.  Been hanging around the house this morning, going through the motions of coffee, getting ready, etc. at a very leisurely pace.  Love these days on break where absolutely nothing needs to be done and we're okay with that.  Had a great half an hour Yoga practice and am now ready to catch up on a little writing.  Yay!  Finally listened to Dido's new CD in its entirety while pounding out those Sun Salutations; stupid European blondes anyway!  Now back to the November Mixy.  It's brilliant, really.    So yea, the break's already feeling really great.  Took a bit to slide into, but now feeling utterly content to let the next three weeks unravel at their own pace.  Christmas is in two days and I'm actually really excited for it.  Get to wrap some presents today.  Mom's sick of wrapping and tried to get me to wrap a couple of my own presents.  That's where I drew the line; it just seems wrong in some way.  Might go to a little movie later, I dunno!  I realize this entry's a bit disorganized and little more than a smathering of random thoughts.  Maybe I should actually tell a story, hmmm.    The night after finals isn't really worth going into, except to say a more-straight-than-the-bi-vibe-she-wishes-she-gave-off-girl who likes to compete for attention in any way she can fell all over me all night.  Not in any way attracted to her, partially because she's a straight guy's fantasy of a lesbian (read: Hetero-Porn version of a lesbian [read: not a lesbian at all]), and partially because of the previous sentence's description.  But hey, we love attention and flattery.  She told all the men hovering around our lesbian sex discussion that she'd rather take me home than any of them.  So glad I don't have to see any of them for a month.    Almost finished with Cold Mountain.  The Boy decided we're seeing it together, so I've got a bit more time.  Trying to figure out how the movie's going to handle all of the characters Inman (that's Jude) encounters in each chapter.  The previews don't really give much away, so I'm hoping it's a good surprise.  Wasn't a fan of The English Patient.  Had the same reaction Elaine from Seinfeld did:  "Just DIE already!!"    Sooo, what else?  Oh!  Getting new glasses!  Yay!  Mine met the working end of a pool cue last week, so you know, that had to be remedied.  They're fucking expensive, though.  Jeeez!  That's where the above-described "shot your wad" line originated, by the way.

      Hey bloggy!  Made it home safe and sound.  Sigh.  Still really tired, though, which is fucking my shit up.  The trip was good, the freezing rain in Moscow notwithstanding.  Relaxed a bit more as each mile flew by.  Had Christmas in Burley today.  Tomorrow's shopping in Idaho Falls.  Yay.  Wonder if the boy will want to do lunchy; hope he can handle Mom.  She's really fun when she's been getting good deals.    Might get into the details of the night after finals at some point; now, though, it's time for bed.

      Made it through.  Just barely.  Still feeling worn and haggard, but think it'll be alright.  Sky's shining out the clearer, just as Sam promised.  The exam was an adventure, too.

      Well, the sun's out and that's a good thing.  It was out yesterday too.  Ordinarily, this wouldn't be that much of a news item, as, theoretically, the sun rises every day.  But for the last 2-3 weeks, we've seen very little of the big guy, so now when he's out with the blue sky I find myself at the window, looking up and saying "That's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen."  Kinda like getting out of a mental institution for an afternoon and seeing a streetlight for the first time in a year; at least that's what I've been told.  So today's the big-ass day, on more than one level.  I don't even want to leave the house, but I'm counting the minutes until I do.  Can't sit still long enough to write morning pages, so instead, the computer will get a nice warm up along with my writing skills.  Don't know why I'm flipping out about this particular exam.  Maybe it's because it's the hardest one, the one sure to knock everyone off their chairs, force us back up and deal with it as best we can.  So over-dramatic, I realize.  Could be that it represents the entire two weeks and 4 months preceding it, too.  Yes, we've been on this journey and we haven't turned back, but now comes the last step and it's the most difficult to take.    The boy's watching Return of the King right now.  Wish I was with him.

      And by "you" I mean "her."  Not in a longing, "Oh I wish it didn't have to be this way; maybe it doesn't, gasp!" kind of way.  More in a "I can't wait to talk to that gal again, she's fun!" kind of way.  Been feeling distance between us for the first time.  Distance that feels good, which is an unusual place to arrive at.  Whenever the daily thoughts arise about her, I've felt really good about the situation, where I'm at with it all, and very excited about that first conversation.  Not so excited that I'll rush to get to it, because I know I'm not ready for it yet, but just knowing that it's going to be so good to talk and laugh with her again.  Expecting a bit of initial weirdness for a bit, as we tentatively come back into our friendship, assuming the new roles and all.    Hoping she's doing well and this time's been as positive a transition as it has for me.

      AOL Member home pages are gay.    I mean really, really gay.  And not even in a cool way.  Guess we'll just have to figure out other ways of spreading my, and others', brilliance around via the blog universe.  My idea was that I could create a page with a bunch of my other writings and kick ass images from the boy, assuming he'd want the advertising, but our stuff is far too valuable and of such greater quality than the AOL member homepage designs that I won't subject the material to such squalor.  So there!  Suppose I could just post my other writings a paragraph at a time on my "daily" entries.  That means you're screwed hon, sorry!

      What blog?  What's a blog?  Okay, I know it's been a while, and I usually love giving people shit for not updating their blogs a semi-daily basis, but damnit, I'm not people!    We're getting down to the wire now, one more exam to go, and it's the mother of all exams.  It's a monster too!  Stupid contracts.  Nobody ever uses them anymore...they're sooo outdated.  Think I've got all the rules down pretty well, it's just that stupid application crap.  I really dig the professor; she's very much a sweet old lady who's a joy to talk to as a person, but she's been teaching this stuff for nearly 30 years and knows it like she knows breathing.  So she's setting the standard very high on the exam, which is a nice little challenge, but also a bit disconcerting when you've worked hard all semester, know pretty much what's going on, but  in your practice exam answer you only get to half of the concepts she gives in her Model Answer.  Don't think the day before this exam is going to be as relaxed as the other "days before" have been.  Had a pretty good study day today.  Changed my study-pals as the usual one's not quite at her peak.  We zoomed through our outlines, and by 130 they were all packing up.  Discussion of the rules we all know only gets you so far, after all, as previously explained.  So after a mid-afternoon break in Student Health with said usual study-pal, managed to work on a couple of practice questions.  Feeling pretty good about them overall, it's just that pesky extra one-half of material on the professor's answers that's bothering be just a titch.  But yoga's coming up here in about an hour, and we love that.  Going to go over more questions and answers tomorrow, too, so all should be well.  Yay.  The Property exam was entirely too easy, but I'm choosing to rejoice in that fact.  Our section was allowed to bring in any material we worked on (class notes, outlines, etc.) as well as our book, which was a bit helpful if for no other reason than to extinguish any excuses for not knowing the requirements for adverse possession.  Felt bad for the other section's students, though.  Here we were with all the material from the entire course spread out around each of our computers and their areas were just plain empty.  Poor suckers.  Have to laugh at the other university students talking about finals week.  Feels like we've had finals Month.  The last two weeks of test-taking have felt longer than the four months it took to learn the material.  Now that it's almost over, it feels a bit bizarre.  In 48 hours, none of us will even remember our names.  If I don't post much after tomorrow, it may well be that any memory of my blog's existence was wiped out Thursday night.    So I'm thinking about setting up a Web page so I can use the links on here.  Seeing as I'm a cheap whore who doesn't want to spend the $6 a month to have a Super Blog on which I can post pictures, I think I'll take advantage of my overpriced AOL internet connection and make a free Web site.  Yay!  Not that anyone would be interested in seeing anything I'd link to, but still.  Then I could say I have a Web page AND a Blog!  My god!  There'd be noooo stopping me then!  Hmmm....think I'll go investigate that very matter...

      Just finished the extended DVD of the Two Towers and all I can think about is last January.  Don't think I'll ever be able to watch that movie without remembering that first night out.  Even watching it in the Pullman theater and now on the futon, still can't get passed that smell, taste, feel of London.  Random days of adventuring flashed behind my eyes as the movie carried on in front of them.  Making our way out of the house around 11 each morning, bracing against the winter chill of the Atlantic.  Wandering through Harrod's food halls and bookstore.  Feeling the stomach clench with emptiness as the shutter clicked, taking "such great pictures" of blurred celebrities.  Bumping around the white room each morning; turning in circles getting ready, hoping his towel and my hair would dry in time.  Only Starbucks tasted the same as it always does.  But it fit in perfectly in the new adventure.    And now I find myself missing it more than ever.  Sam's speech about the great stories will always do me in, but Aragorn's dream sequence with Arwen is what I end up remembering that I didn't want to forget.  He's accepted his duty/role, knows he will follow it wherever it may take him, but has no idea why or how he's going to pull it off.  Sounds very familiar.  And her reply is finally spot on.    And then there's Cate and her damn Galadriel.  If all the hype and that little place deep within us are to be believed, this third round will mirror just as much as the first two.  We won't be able to understand entirely how right away, but we'll have some idea.  We'll return forever changed, knowing the story's finally been told to its end and will carry on, almost as usual.

      It's almost noon and I can't seem to get out of my PJs and start my day.  Only got up about 45 minutes ago.  Felt really good to sleep in; think this is as refreshed as I've felt in the last week or so.  Yay.  Remember that Property practice exam I was talking about forever ago?  Yea, think I might actually get to it today.  Not sure what else, though.  Might just be a nice, lazy, relaxed but still getting things done/studied day.  Those can be fun.  Maybe spend some time with the new book later, I dunno!  Hope I don't get bogged down in re-learning everything about the Discovery Rule or the three types of interpretation concerning the Hostility requirement for Adverse Possession.  That's right!  I said Adverse Possession!  It's still around!  So the Property final will consist of two questions.  The first will be a series of land grants (remember that other post with all that giving to letters of the alphabet?) after which we'll be required to give the state of the title.  The second will be to write a judicial opinion ruling on a set of given facts.  Imagine the professor will pack as much as he possibly can into those facts so we'll have to juggle everything we've learned this semester.  We've got four hours, though, so it should be entirely do-able.  My comfort level seems to be rising in the days before each exam, just as my celebratory mood seems to be rising in the hours following each exam.  Hmmm.  Hope I'm not setting myself for terrible failure and disappointment.    So the Grandparents are moving out of their house for good this weekend.  They just might have spent their first night in the tiny new house last night.  Got the official word from Mom last weekend that we're having Christmas dinner at our house.  This will be the first time in history it hasn't been at Grandma's.  And she's not even going to be up in our kitchen, making anything.  She's actually going to let Mom take care of it!  Can you imagine?  Mom's worried her stuffing will turn out to be soup, but I've forbidden her from using Stove Top, so we'll see how it goes.  We may be asking Grandma to help out next year.    Got a birthday in two weeks.  I'm always so shocked when I finally do the math and discover it's almost my birthday.  Just remember being a kid and starting the countdown right after Halloween.  By the time it finally arrived, it didn't even matter because I was so sick of waiting for it.  Have to say, though, I've always enjoyed not having to face the day-after-Christmas let-down.  How do you follow a day like that, really?  Having a birthday works, oddly enough.  And it works every time.  Last year's was a bit rough, though.  Stupid passports, anyway.  Very excited for this year's.  Gonna have a great gay (but not too gay!) time with the boyfriend and whoever else we can scrape together.  And we won't stop until it's 2004!    Or 2030!!

      Hey blogger!  Having SUCH a good night, can't even stand it.  If the evening following each exam is going to keep getting better and better, next week's going to be Out of Control, I tell ya what!  So the Torts exam rocked the cock.  Or rather, I rocked the Tort exam's cock.  Oh yea, don't even try that prima facie case shit on me, sister!  I'll mop the floor with your prima facie case!!    Went to the Alehouse with some comrades afterward and had some dinner, beer, good laughs and inappropriate touching.  Can't get any better than that!  Yoga was sooo our friend tonight.  Instructors in little, loose-fitting cotton tank tops are always our friends.  Plus, the standing-pose practice was great for harnessing all that powerful energy and putting it to good use.  Beer and burger kinda sloshed around, but I was in such a great place that I didn't even really notice.  Yay!  Drove all the way home and only then do I remember I'm out of coffee.  But that just means more time in Harley with the great, uplifting, GRRR music playing and we can always use more of that.  Got the November Mix in the player now and we're going great on Track 4 and not a icky clicky noise to be heard...Rock.On!  Okay, got Jack & Karen hour coming up here pretty quick, so I best be off.  Might just be back in half an hour, though, I dunno!

      The last few days have all looked exactly the same: grey, dreary, soggy.  But there's no snow, yay!  They've been warmer than most of October, which is odd, but appreciated.  Just finished the last of my studying for the big Torts exam tomorrow.  I'm sooo ready for Torts; bring on the rat poison disguised as sugar left next to the coffee pot to explode in a felony committing unauthorized visitor in the laboratory's kitchen's face questions!!  As me about Duty, I dare ya!  Or even Proximate Cause!  You don't know about Cause until you talk Proximate Cause, buddy!  Hope I'm not getting all oddly confident only to be sandbagged on the exam.  I've taken two practice ones with success, so I don't think my comfort is unfounded.  Next week's going to be the tougher exams.  Property and Contracts.  Like we need either of them, really.  Going to spend the rest of the day with Susan's Contracts study guide.  Probably a good part of Friday, too.    So "Cold Mountain" is finally getting good.  Probably has something to do with my finally sitting down and reading it for more than 20 minutes.  Can't wait to see Nicole play this role; yet another departure for her.  Suppose none of her roles are really departures, since she has yet to actually define her ability through a particular archetypical role in the first place.  So really, because all of her roles are departures, they're all very much Nicole and not departures at all!  Renee's going to be great as Ruby, too.  I hope they play up the lesbian angle of their relationship.  You just can't tell me that two women working together for survival in the harsh, unforgiving world of Civil War Appalachians aren't going to be finding their only comfort in each other's arms.  You can't!

      The night went well.  Watched "Finding Nemo" with Joey Bear after dinner; had tears streaming down my face every time Ellen or Allison Janney spoke.  Made the poor boy watch all their scenes over and over again.  Good Christ, who do these damn kid-movie-makers think they are coming up with this shit?  We need them for OUR movies!    So, I'm home now.  In Pocatello.  Decided I didn't need to subject myself to all this stress and trauma any longer.  The basement resort in the mountain fortress looks just fine right about now and I don't regret my decision at all.  It came to me around 342 this morning.  Got off the phone with Levi last night and felt fine about the ways of the world and my place in it.  But soon enough, I realized I was doing the whole "law school" thing for the wrong reasons.  I thought I had to do it for other people.  So I'd have enough recognition, enough worth.  It seemed a challenge befitting someone of my talents and abilities, but I was never really truly convinced.  And for a while, I may have enjoyed myself, been happy even.  But not anymore.  If I have to go through this every 3 to 4 months, I want no part of it.  There's nothing for me here worth all this.  Mom helped tipped the scales.  Called her around 6 to ask her opinion, as all I'd done during the night was pace around the house, sweating and fighting off diarrhea.    "I'm coming home, Mom.  I'm not going to go through with all of this."  "Really?  Had enough?"  "I have.  I can live in Pocatello; it's not that bad.  I could be happy there."  "I know, I think you're right.  I never really understood why you thought you had to go to law school, anyway.  Just to prove to yourself you could?"  "Yea, probably.  But now I realize I don't have to prove anything to anyone.  I can work at the Phone Center again until I find something better.  This just isn't worth all the stress and anxiety.  I never really liked it that much to begin with."  "Sounds good honey, I'll get your room ready."  So yea, here I am and loving it.     (Author's Note: And by all of the writing above, I mean the exam went beautifully and I'm doing fine...FINE!)

      The drive and yoga helped.  Quite a bit, actually.  Getting ready to go to dinner with my brother, Joe.  He's good people.  Sounded a bit stressed himself when I called earlier to see how "The Hulk" went and whether it was worth my time.  He said no, so Harley won my attention instead.  Talked to Susan a while ago.  We agreed that our nervousness is a good sign.  We obviously care, are invested and want to do well.  Those without a care, thought, worry, etc. are probably the folks in trouble.  Of course, they could be totally together because of their confidence in their abilities, which is where I think I'm getting to.  As the night progresses, bringing the exam closer, I'm feeling more capable, confident and assured.  Hope it lasts through the night.

      So, did a nice little practice exam answer this morning, and, per the Oracle's instructions, left it for an hour or so, came back to check my aptitude and did pretty well.  Yay.  Wanted to try another question from the same Web site, but alas, there were none on the other issues we covered in class.  Bummer.  Now just waiting for the laundry to finish so I can distract myself with that for a few minutes.  These kind of days are so odd.  The ones where you're just waiting for the next day to arrive.  Suppose I could go back and refine my original answer, just for the sake of typing it all out; hopefully my hands will remember the process even if my mind doesn't.  I'm torn between studying for the subsequent exams and not over-extending myself.  Really, I'm not sure how well reviewing other material would sink in at this point.  Wondering about my classmates.  Hoping they all slept well and aren't ripping their hair out today.  Think we all run a risk of over-reviewing, -studying, -practicing.  Doing it all to the point where we think ourselves out of knowing the material.    Think I'll take a drive in a bit.  Maybe do some yoga while the clothes dry.    I don't imagine alcohol has tasted or will taste better than it will Thursday the 18th at 4 pm.

      Told my brother about an hour ago that I couldn't watch "The Hulk" with him because I'd be going to bed soon.  Just thought I'd check up on my email and favorite blogs, and suddenly, I don't feel like sleeping.  Think it had more to do with the movie we'd just finished watching: "Pirates of the Caribbean".  It would have been sooo much better had it been an hour shorter.  No Disney movie should be over 2 hours long.  Especially not one about a damn ride.    Okay, this is going to be cut a bit short, as I'm engaging in a conversation with my first fan.

      Happy Saturday, bloggy!  Just about to get in the shower and head over to some gal's place to do some hard-core Civil Procedure studying.  Feeling good about it.  Think today, tomorrow and the exam will go well; it's just a matter of doing it.  In my mini-counseling session Thursday with Academic Support Oracle-lady, she said:  "What I'm sensing from talking with you is that you're very aware of what you need to be doing, that you've been keeping up with reading, studying, reviewing all semester, you've been doing everything you're supposed to and you know what you need to do to prepare.  Now you just have to go do it."  That's always the clincher, isn't it?    Watched The Fellowship of the Ring last night.  It's been a while, and it was a nice little refresher.  Seems like forever since I first saw it New Year's Day 2002.  The world was dark and scary, and I was the emotional equivalent of a sniveling-Gollum-like creature, continuously shifting between Smeagol's "Come along, Master, we'll show you the way!" and Gollum's "Murderer!" (I realize those are lines from The Two Towers, just go with it for now.)  Okay, not really, but the swings in my optimism and trust in the universe's plans were huge and frequent.  Frodo's scenes with Gandalf were the best and the worst.  Usually reduced me to tears and uncontrollable wails...right there in the movie theater.    "Shut UP Gandalf!  You.Don't.Know!!"  But knowing he really did.  So it was interesting to watch it again and look back, now that I'm on the journey I was afraid to take then.  The thing that really struck me was how all the characters thought their jobs were done in the first hour and a half.  They all get to Rivendell and think that's it.  They have no idea what they're actually about to do.  Or maybe they do and are trying to talk themselves out of that knowing.    Then we get to The Towers and it's all downhill from there.  I really didn't intend this post to be a treatise in comparing the Lord of the Rings to my life, but what the hell.  The day's gray and wet, a good one for studying...

      ...to let you know I made it through the day.  Got 4-4.5 hours of Civil Procedure done this afternoon.  Sigh.  Still have more to go, but it's a good start.  Also thought I'd let you know this could very well become my sole mode of communication for a bit, unless you contact me.  I mean, I'll totally talk if you call me, and I'll read and enjoy any comments/emails sent in, but don't feel hurt if/when I don't respond until the week of Christmas.  Feel like I'm entering (or have entered) a Zone...of what exactly, I'm not sure, but one I don't plan on returning from for two weeks.  Coming of it out a bit for some Thursday night TV, tea and Grandma's home-made cinnamon rolls.

      Not sure how I feel about new features on my Internet Explorer browser appearing today when they weren't there yesterday and I did no downloading, updating to make them be here.  Had a host of new "favorites" too.  Hmmm.    So my grip on reality's returning.  Almost time for Civ Pro review class, then heading home to get cozy with the subject's study guide for the rest of the afternoon.  Talked to the Academic Support girlie after class this morning.  Very much Oracle-like: she told me exactly what I needed to hear.  She also had some good tips for what to do the day before each final.  I was a bit worried that I'd sit around and...well, worry.  I always do better if I'm DOING something, so she gave me suggestions, and we love those.    Yoga will feel sooo good tonight, methinks.

      Spent the night more awake than not.  Starting to feel the legendary anxiety in a big way, as if you couldn't tell.  But had dreams around 3-4ish about Property exam answers and felt slightly better, as I seemed to know what I was doing in the dream.  Think I was mostly upset at myself for not making the best use of my time, and last night was what finally tipped the scales.  On the one hand, I'm still really glad I went to the panel, but on the other, I'm realizing now, I should have stayed home and studied.  Because, really, there's no more time to waste.  First final's this Monday and I have yet to use the study guides to fill in the gaps in my understanding of Civil Procedure.    Saw the Return of the King trailer just as I was leaving the house and was again motivated.  All the shots of the characters about to meet the challenge they've spent the last 2 movies preparing themselves for; finding out if, after all that, they've really got it in them to do what they must.  "All you have to decide is what to do with the time that's given to you."  And that Gandalf always knows just what to say!

      There are people at school...right now...studying for next week's and the week after's finals.  Part of me wonders if they're incredibly unlucky, unprepared, unorganized, etc. or if they're going to be the ones cruising through the exams.  The girl I talked to said she was there until 11 last night.  That means she had 9 hours before Property class this morning.  I'm remembering all the things the upperclass-persons told us the first few weeks of class about how each student will have his/her own study methods and not to judge your own by the person next to you.  And really, we'll only know for sure what works for us and what wastes time is next January after the grades have been posted and the exams are reviewed the first day of class.    A 2nd year told me today: "No matter what happens this semester, you still have second semester to make up for it."  They don't actually kick you out until after your first year's completed.  Less than a C average will do it.  Doesn't  sound  hard.  My Contracts professor gave one (1) A last fall.  Torts professor, five (5) As.  And as dire as all this is beginning to sound, I'm really not worried that I'm going to bomb the whole thing completely; it's just the obligatory "what ifs..." starting to perk up.  So, have to go through the process of dealing with them and being comfortable with my level of preparation.  Or do more.    Tonight I cut the study time a bit short to go to a panel discussion on AIDS.  I know, World AIDS Day was Monday, so what the hell is left to talk about?  Don't really know why I felt compelled to go, but think it has something to do with the fact that I've never attended anything like it in the past.  Ever.  It just seemed right somehow.  There was about 20-25 people there.  Don't know why I expected a crowded courtroom, but I did.  There are less people dying but more people getting infected.  My guess would be that because there's less death, less attention's being paid to the ever-increasing problem.  Without the action/excitement/drama of people dying, what is there to do/care about people just getting sick?  Suppose I have one more issue to listen for when the candidates make their pitches.    Speaking of which, I just have to say that Carol Moseley Braun, even though she doesn't stand a chance, is totally my nominee.  If, by some bad B-movie completely unforeseen and unwarranted twist of fate, she were to win the nomination, I think she may just have a shot at the office, if only on the sheer novelty of the idea.  Folks have been known to vote (and win) on similar grounds.  The thing I love about her most is the fact that she's the only candidate actually SAYING anything because she has nothing to lose.  Dean, Kerry and Gephardt all have to bide their time, talk in parables and lofty goals, waiting until the race actually starts before they actually start saying anything when they speak.  The remaining candidates are, honestly, entertainment, CSPAN fodder.  I'm still waiting for Hillary to change her mind.  Or for the party to draft her into the nomination.  There's petitions, you know.

      Evening blogger!  Just returned from the sexy yoga class.  Did a lot of leg stretches to get back into the routine after the week off.  Glad I had a mini-practice this morning...there was much groaning and sweating, and not entirely unpleasant at that!  Now just trying to relax for the night.  Got my mango-passion-fruit tea all hot and ready for consumption.  So tonight's class was a good time.  Instructor wore her tight, green tank-top; yes, a good night, indeed.  She's really a great teacher, I have to say.  Yes, it's true I have a fondness for teachers to begin with, but so what?  She's petite, wears black square-ish (bordering on geeky) glasses, has a little kid smile that dominates her face and Madonna-esque built arms.  She chants during the quiet, meditative "corpse pose" portion of the practice, which is such a nice touch.  Tank-tops are our friends.   Feeling better about everything in general today, which is nice.  My resolve's slipping back into place.  The other hormonal shoe's probably about to drop, though, so I'm preparing myself for that.  Suppose that's something you all get to look forward to: the updates on Andrea's menstrual cycle.  Yay!  It informs so much of my life at certain times that anyone close to me has the thing down almost as well as I do.  That's what we're all about here, after all.  Studied Torts all afternoon; feeling a bit more on top of that subject, at least.  It's actually one of the subjects that's come the most easily to me.  Probably because it deals a lot with finding a balance between various circumstances, principles, etc.  Balance Rocks!  Borrowed some study guides from Susan; she's so on top of that shit.    Called her on my way over to get them, and pulled into her driveway as the second ring ended:    "Answer, damnit!"  Pause and a bit of a laugh.  "Is that any way to talk to me?"  Yea, totally busted.  But it was a nice little classic moment.  Perhaps not as classic as others, but not bad.  She still let me in her house and borrow study materials, and I'm grateful.

      After no consideration whatsoever, I decided not to start typing these posts in a saveable forum (i.e. Word Perfect) and continue typing them at the Blogger site, leaving myself susceptible to incidents similar to the one last night.    So my brand new DVD player is acting funny.  I'm not freaking out, although I have considered dropping it out the window to see if that improves its attitude any.  Think I have the problem figured out, though.  It makes a weird noise sometimes while playing certain songs.  It's this sound that precipitated the stopping of playing and grinding sound of its predecessor.  It only happens on songs copied from MP3 files.  The other copied songs play just dandy.  Think I can handle that.  It plays movies beautifully, so at least there's that.  Had an okay day.  Wish I could either get to the point where I feel comfortable with my preparation-study process for finals or just get the damn things over with, because I'm finding myself stuck somewhere in between.  Feeling better tonight after getting back into the school routine and talking to the boy.  Went to the opening reception of an intriguing art exhibit for World AIDS Day.  Chatted with the interim director of the Women's Center.  No sparks to speak of, but a few nice chuckles.  Was nice to get my mind off the biggest thoughts of the day, for a bit at least.     Think I might actually get around to sinking my teeth into the new book: Cold Mountain.  I know, I'm a few years late, but I'd like to get through it before the movie's released.  Actually bought it in Seattle last December; it's only fitting I get around to reading it this year.  It was my first purchase in the store I affectionately call The Pussy Book Store; it's just off Broadway, the heart of Seattle's big gay district.  The first time I walked through its door, in the summer of 2001, I was immediately struck by the pet-store smell.  The wandering felines and hidden-in-the-sea-of-similar-flyers advertisement for cat-sitting eventually alerted me to the used bookstore's alternate identity.  And a trip to the Emerald City's never been complete without a visit since.

      Two big Friday nights in a row.  Who would have thought?  Well, I did, but I suppose that doesn't count.  And really, they weren't really "big" in the ordinary sense.  Pretty damn normal, actually.  But they weren't spent in front of the TV for once (then twice!) and that's big.    It hit me a couple of weeks into January that I had yet to make a New Year's resolution.  Had such a great one last January, what with all the excitement and joy of exploring and adventuring, that this year's was forgotten in the nostalgia.  So, it came to me one morning at the kitchen table with morning pages: I decided to be more proactive.  Learned last year to pay attention, listen and breathe; this year it's time to start using those lessons.  Don't yet know how precisely, but I'm sure it'll come to me.    So yea, had a good night out.  This week kicked my ass, so a big damn bunch of queers dancing to Top 40 remixes sounded perfect.  The homework will be light, too, and we have to take advantage of that.  The show was good; the first one after a dry spell always feels great.  It was Kathy's birthday celebration, so every song performed was from the 80s or before.  So great.  Peggy Lee.  Dusty Springfield.  The new remix of the Laverne & Shirley theme-song.    Was on my own for the second show, and was buzzed just enough to continue dancing by myself in the sea of young things.  Yay.  Tried to track down the birthday girl to thank her properly for the free entrance fee, and ended up people-watching with the Voice of God.  She's a barrel of laughs, wields a mean screwdriver and makes for a great DJ.  Pink is right!  Eventually, Kathy took me into her big office and we enjoyed a sensitive chat on her couch about toilet gaskets and the asshole-tax for Frat boys.    Today's been spent pretty much entirely on the futon, the day's single outing being a journey across the state line for The Butterfly Effect.  I really enjoy the preview.  Wish they'd just stuck with that.  It's one of those rare movies that's bad in the first 10 minutes and never improves.  People actually screamed a few times, and I laughed out loud a few more.  Demi was behind the whole thing.  It reeks of her.  So glad I get to see Lost in Translation tomorrow.    But for tonight, I think I'll get cozy with a new comic and a new novel.

      Goddamn Boy.  Messes everything up.  I call him to ask one simple question that would normally take us 45 minutes to answer, but no, he has to talk for an hour and a goddamned half.  As if I don't have anything better to do.  Told him I had this blog entry cooking up all day, but he didn't even take a breath as he spoke right over the top of me.  Good thing he fucks like a banshee, or I'd never forgive him.  So I completely underestimated the outline for the Motion to Suppress Evidence assignment.  Left school around 3 with the best of intentions to work diligently as soon I returned home until it was completed.  Then I would have all evening to write a long, lazy, juicy blog and maybe even start a new book.  Instead, my futon sucked me into its void and there I remained until 430.  Stupid Dr. Phil.  Arranging the work space, surrounding my desk with proper authority, choosing the perfect background music, etc. took another 15 minutes.  Here's where the underestimation comes in:  I let myself watch TV for so long thinking the assignment wouldn't take very long; once I got started on it.  Knew precisely what I was going to say.  The damn thing was practically written in the cases waiting in my backpack.  All I had to do was patch them together in outline form.  Shouldn't take more than 2 hours.    There's a moment at the beginning of each and every writing enterprise that bears a striking resemblance to the end of each and every research session.  The moment where everything in front of you is nothing you can use.  All of it made sense half an hour ago.  But now that it's time to do something, it may as well be written in Greek.  So the blank page stared at me for more than a few minutes, taunting.    "Uh huh, that's right!"  It said, hand on hip.  "Glad you watched that last case on Judge Judy NOW, aren't you?"  But those moments are always defeated.  The outline's a glorious 4 pages and it only took an hour more than my estimation.  Which leaves me a bit less time than I hoped to devote to my blog, but we'll make do.  My friends' reactions to the blog (and the content included therein) have been interesting.  The new ones probably just take it all in stride, as part of who I am.  The older ones, though, have been more than a bit surprised.  How could someone who kept much of herself private, hidden from casual conversation, suddenly be this revealing?  Their surprise is a good thing, I think (hope); but it raises a valid question.  And I'm not sure I have an adequate answer, other than to say I was ready.    I'm reminded of a conversation with my boss at my high school job.    "I can read people very easily.  It's fun to freak them out with my observations; some of them are like books."  "What do you read from me?"  I asked, trying not to sound as curious as I was.  "I can't."  "What do you mean?"  He was one of the few people I spent most of my time with at work, after all; he HAD to have some kind of read on me!  "You're impossible to read.  Very protective of yourself, don't let much emotion through."  "Really?" I replied, trying to figure out how I could have been so obvious.  "But I think I have it narrowed down to a couple of explanations why.  You're either hiding something, or you've been hurt in the past.  And you don't seem to be the type who would have something to hide."  As it turns out, he was right on both counts.    A big part of what I was hiding has been recounted here.  Mostly because I was ready to tell it.  The last year has been a study in being open and receiving, letting go of control and needing to know, beginning to see the person I've always wanted to be.  And this has been an excellent tool in that undertaking.    Remember the day I was sure the letter in the mailbox was the rejection from the law school because it was too small to be acceptance materials.  I looked, saw, closed the mailbox without taking it out and went to class.  The walk was pretty transcendental, I have to say.  The significance of the fact that it was the way to my Creative Nonfiction writing class wasn't lost on me.  Walking back, I promised myself I would stop resisting the part of me who is a writer.  Up until then, I'd put the choice out to the universe: law or writing.  "You tell me what I should do, cosmos, the decision has tortured me long enough!"  That day it seemed I had my answer.  Soon realized the letter was the wait-list notification.  Three months, a round of personal growth and daily appointments with a notebook and pen later, I had both and was on my way to adventures undreamed.    And I'm still loving the ride.  So my little bloggy was really just another step in that process of exploring, growing, learning.  Don't think I kept this stuff from you, friends, and, in turn, had no problem writing about it for all to read.  I finally am ready to share more of myself with you and am able to here, in my favorite passion.

      Spend more time at the Women's Center.  They're good people over there.  It's quiet, welcoming, comfortable and a perfect place to do reading for class when the basement gets to be too much.  Plus, hippie Yoga types hang out there.  And the athletes running around on the floor above the Center reminds me of home.

      So you better watch out for that.  The law school's eerily quiet at 6 in the evening.  It's pretty nice, actually; if one can ride out the waves of students fresh from class until they all leave for the day, one can actually get a thing or two done!  The thing or two done tonight included reading for tomorrow's Civil Procedure class (the horror!) and Thursday's Criminal Law class (because that day's Contracts reading is already done--Yay.) so as to make room for time to complete the writing assignment's outline due Friday, even though she'll give us until Monday.  Have yet to read the final case (that is sure to change the very nature of said outline) needed for said assignment, so I need all the time I can give myself.  Now I have exactly one hour to get home, change, find my bearings, and get to Yoga.    Hope this morning's black ice hasn't returned now that the sun's finished for the day.  The walk into school earlier was a bit treacherous, as treks across parking lots go.  Black ice on asphalt does not give.  Not even a bit.  And I'm the biggest pussy when it comes to walking on ice and/or snow.  This fact is exacerbated by fellow students cursing along, passing me without a second glance or thought about navigating the new terrain.  They must have no fear of death.  Like Aragorn.    So class participation in Property is our friend.  Had a sneaking suspicion that those points helped my exam score up over the C/B hump, and my professor confirmed said suspicion in our meeting yesterday.  Strictly point-wise, I should have had a C+ on the exam, but my probing, insightful comments in class gave me that extra edge we so love in times of need.  Yay.    Suppose that gives me more leverage in executing Susan's Operation Liberal Countermeasures in every class.  (Aside: wonder if writing case briefs for 2 hours before posting changes the tone/style of blog postings.)

      Feels like a big blog day coming on, and there will probably be a long, juicy entry later in the day, but I just have to say something now.  Johnny fucking Depp as Best Actor in Pirates of the Caribbean.  Okay.    I can forgive the Hollywood Foreign Press for nominating him; the members are eccentric; they're like that; they do that type of thing.  And the American Academy might have gotten away with it, if only for the laugh it produces.  But no laugh can ever purge the taint of the travesty of the Academy's omission.  No nomination for Viggo Mortenson.  No nomination for any of the LOTR cast members.  But Johnny "I look like a reporter on the take from the roaring '20s" Depp gets a nod for his drag queen performance in a movie based on a ride at Disneyland.    Aragorn carried that damn movie!!  He IS THE FUCKING  KING !!  AS IN "RETURN OF THE  KING !!!  I dunno.    I just don't know.

      A snipet from last night:    (Gasp!) "What are they saying? Who's on stage?"  "Bill Murray just won."  "Hurray! We love you, Bill Murray!"  "Hey, there's Cate! Hi Cate!"  "CATE! Is she gorgeous?"  "She's gorgeous and Pregnant!"  "(GASP!) NO! What's she wearing?"  And this kind of description went on for hours. It was like being blind and crippled in a dark cave, with only an echoing voice to illuminate the world outside. It was great!   I love being an echoing voice!

      Been working diligently in the basement for almost 5 hours.  Feels good.  I decided, pretty much subconsciously, that I would do more work when reading cases.  I usually brief (summarize) the assigned cases, read and highlight the notes following them and move on.  Today found me taking notes on the notes AND introductory material in front of cases.  My god!  In some instances those notes exceeded the initial brief.  Overall, I think the change is a good one; couldn't hurt at the very least.  Not sure how the 2 subjects (4 cases) in 5 hours will work during a usual week, but feel pretty confident about the new arrangement going in.    Soon I'll be headed home for some light cleaning (the floor needs a good vacuuming at the very least), and maybe some not-so-light Yoga before settling in with the Globies.  Not sure when the next book, Ghostwritten, will get its start, but the wait's worthwhile.  Trying to remedy my habit of beginning (and continuing) books in the moments before bedtime in favor of reserving nice, big blocks of quality time for them.  Kinda like one would if one had a lover.    In other important-in-a-completely-insignificant-way news, my feet seem to have adapted to my new shoes to the point where I can at last wear them without fear of wearing the skin away from the back of my foot, just above the heel.  YAY!

      "I'm 64% sure this woman sitting over here is a lesbian."  Dan said with his trouble-maker look.  "Okay, show me."  I shot Dan's friend Mike a look and said, "Bet I'll know the person."  We crept to the non-smoking side of The Garden, assumed very conspicuous bar-stools overlooking the lower level.  He pointed and said, "Those two over by the window."  But I was already descending the stairs on my way to greet my friends Emily and Lori.  They work at the Women's Center.  They're feminists.  And straight.  Emily reminds me of a blonde Alanis Morissette.  Lori was in my Yoga class; she's in Level 2 now and is training to become an instructor herself.  I met them during the Year of Darkness, Winter/Spring 2002.  Emily was the co-founder of UI's first and only student feminist group.  Interviewed her for the Argonaut when the group put on the Vagina Monologues that February.  It was a hit and so were they.  She was the first to read my famous vagina column; she approved, but my editor made me tone it down.  My sociology professor, Debbie, introduced me to Lori during one of our Directed Study "meetings" at the Prospector aka Alehouse.  That was the day Debbie said we'd be back in this bar after my first semester was over, figuring out what I was  really   going to do with my life because I'd hate law school.       The boys and I found ourselves discussing the waitresses with tight skirts and the social statement that seemed to make.  Dan's a debater.  And he's exhausting.  I pawned him off on the gals and watched the sparks fly.  Lori and Dan had a class together years ago, so she knew how to handle him.  She made great points about power differentials, societal expectations, etc. while he countered with definition-differences and the pressure on men to be tall.    "I was trying to ditch them so we could actually have a nice chat." I whispered to Lori as we hugged when I left.    "No worries," she replied; she's so sweet that way.  "Tell Debbie 'Hi', that I'm thinking of her and she owes me a beer."  Because I'm sweet that way.  So Big Fish was good.  I'll give it a B.  Ewen was his adorable, endearing self.  Bit sugar-coated for Tim Burton, but he pulled it off.  Think I'll have to see it again when I'm not half-asleep.  Seemed a bit long, but I suppose that could have been a stylistic technique.  Saw Pieces of April today.  It gets a big fat A.  We love independent movies shot with handhelds.  It's a very simple story with a very simple ending that made me smile big.  And Katie's actually pretty damn cute in it.  Even if the story had completely sucked, seeing Sean Hayes's (Just Jack) performance with Burnadette made the outing worth it.    Back now in my little den, avoiding the Christmas break-esque weather.  Have a terrible craving for hot buttered rum and a satellite dish.  Just finishing some laundry, getting ready to have a Queer as Folk refresher.  Season Three's due out in a month, after all.    Always feel better/lighter after posting.  The weekends are a bit conducive to creative blockage and these are a great foil.

      That's exactly what I mean!  Goin' out for beers with cute Dan and cuter Sadie, to be followed by Big Fish with desk-mate Paul.  He's cute, too.  That's more action than I've had since getting freaky with Natalie at Charley's in Pocatello!    Skipped morning pages this morning and it's thrown me off all day.  Just don't feel like doing anything.  Actually, that's not true.  I feel like doing things, like taking notes, studying and typing them, etc., only half-heartedly.  Even now, I'm finished with everything, but I don't really want to leave because I'll just have to go down to the SUB, pick up my W-2, then go to the mall to secure the Parents' Happy Anniversary card.  It's just too much!  Plus, January's decided it's not giving up on Winter just yet, so we've had a steady stream of snowfall all day.  I could get back to Levi's sister about an essay she requested my insights and opinions for, but even that would be half-assed at this point.  And we hate half asses.    But the weekend seems to be shaping up.  Will have enough homework to save me from boredom, and am thinking I'll check out Pieces of April at the old, hippie, liberal-run theater downtown.  And the Golden Globes are on Sunday night, so I'll have to spend a good half day getting ready for that.  Wow!  Suddenly the world seems like such a perfect place!

      Yes, I am; and something tells me you are too.  Think we will begin to glimpse your mind and blind artistry before too long.    It's been a good day.    Worked hard at school, both in classes and out of them.  Came home to a message from Carrie, whom I've missed over the past few weeks while her phone sage raged across the country.  Found out Erika's (the instructor) chants/songs haven't gone anywhere; they're just waiting for her voice to rest.  And am now settling into the night with some hot soup in preparation for the Jack & Karen Hour.  Yes, it's been a good day.

      Kudos to my Good-Samaritan-hero-of-the-week (she knows who she is).  Not only did she call to admit an error in understanding an assignment, which takes more courage than any of us are willing to admit, I mean really, but she also stopped to help victims in a collision.  She made fire from grass and toilet paper, boiled water and made them all herbal tea to heal their wounds.  And it worked!  Plus, she threw down on a wimpy on-looker, who probably deserved a kick in the balls to start with, but, in her infinite wisdom and patience (that's right!  Patience!), our heroine knew the man's humiliation in the face of her bravery, poise and unwavering commitment to preserving all that is good and pure in humanity was punishment enough.  Let's help her think up a name for her embryonic blog, shall we?

      I'm tired and I don't know what day it is.    Not much more to say than that, but I love using the university's wireless Internet, especially to post, so you know.    Just leaving for the day, but there'll be plenty of reading to be done this afternoon/evening.  It just seems wrong to be following up White Teeth (the book I finished the other night) with Contracts and Criminal Law.

      Since she made fun of my blog, insinuating that I include all the incidental, pointless, random occurrences during a day's passing, and, by extension, that such occurrences are of no interest to my readers, I'm including the story that gave rise to the discussion in the first place, in condensed form.  Susan received a free sandwich at Arby's this afternoon, which brought up associations I have with said establishment's roast beef.  The associations stem from a drive through Bozeman a couple years ago with Natalie and the Boy, during which Natalie compared Arby's roast beef with a particular area of the female anatomy.  This whole discussion would work better if I remembered the actual line Nat delivered that fateful day, but that's beside the point.  The point is: the random, pointless stories I tell in this blog are much better when I take myself seriously in telling them, with a few flourishes of sarcasm and irreverence.  Recounting such stories only if they're important, relevant, etc. in the grand scheme of humanity wouldn't be very fun, as the above illustrates.    To drive the point home, let me tell you another story, plucked from the day's activities.  Stopped by Oracle-lady's office on the way to Civil Procedure.  She's good fun and is loose with her candy supply.  "Well, I think you're entitled to some Smarties," she said after I told her I was happy with how my first semester went.  "Or some Dumb-Dumbs," she laughed, referring to those little suckers the banks across the land have become famous for distributing, "depending on how you're feeling today."  I spied a third option (one might even say 'alternative'..gasp!), instead.  "Actually, I think I'll take a Nip."  I said, knowing the significance of such a choice was lost on her, but enjoying the joke thoroughly nonetheless.

      30 pages to go and I'm wishing I was 30 pages in.    Hit a mental roadblock about 45 minutes ago and couldn't go on.  It disguised itself as fatigue.  That Sunday night (for our present purposes, the role of "Monday" will be played by "Sunday") reminder that tomorrow brings with it not only another day, but another week.  Realize now it was really my subconscious, fighting like hell against the end.  Knowing every page turned is bringing me closer to the last place I want to be.  Finishing a favorite book is always hard, but this...I started missing this book on page 80.  Now I'm on 510; can't move forward but can't let it go, either.  Thank god Susan called.  Otherwise I'd be done by now.  But no; I have 30 pages yet!  Yay!

      Have an entire day ahead of me with no schedule of events.  Of course, I could read cases, but I'm not sure I'll get to those because I'll be too busy to actually do anything too school-related.  Could go for a drivey, maybe through the Lentil capital of the world, hmmmm???  Do have a dirty Mexican porn to watch.  And a book to finish.  And Sean Astin's on Ellen's show right now, so what more do ya need?  Sam and Dory together!    "Don't go where I can't follow!"  "Ooh! Ooh!  Pick me!  Pick me!"  "I can't carry it for you..."  "A clam!"  "...But I can carry you!"  "Are you my conscience?"  Oh, and props to Martin Luther King, Jr.  Thanks for the day off, man, way to go.

      With all this talk about Iowa and its damn "caucuses", I've found myself at a loss for knowing just what it is.  Suppose we'll all know tomorrow.  And no, I can't just research it on my own, so don't ask.    So I'm about to settle in with my nightly jug of tea after my nightly (you guessed it) yoga practice.  I'm addicted, what can I say?    "I have hot calves!" is what I can say!  They actually have muscle-mass.  For the first time since I was 9!  I have calf muscles!!  My upper-arms are even joining in!  I realize this is probably less than invigorating news for the lot of you, but, for me, this is really big shit.  I've always wanted to have that sculpted, toned look that goes oh-so-well with tank-tops, but without having to actually go to the gym.  And now I'm on my way to exactly that.  Yay.  Look out June!    Picked up a dirty Mexican movie along with some hot lesbain stand-up comedic action on the side, so the night should be an exciting one.  Don't really want to ruin the great run the player's on with the Winter Mix.  Discovered something new about my temperamental player:  if I just let it run on one disc continuously, all the way through, even a burned disc, it doesn't throw a fit.  I may even be able to put a single disc on "Random."  But as soon as I start skipping songs or throwing the "All Disc" format together with "Random", it starts to whine.  I'll figure this damn thing out yet.  And keep you all posted, too.  Speaking of which, can I just say (in all seriousness) how much I adore my latest regular reader?  Because I do; even more than she loves to hate writing assignments.

      That's Lorraine's attempt at spelling dilemma.  It was too good not to post, and even better to put in the title.    So today's been nice and productive; well, more nice  because  it's been productive, you know.  Got more than a few cases to review for the first writing assignment of the semester.  Research always sounds fun/easy/relaxed, etc. before you actually sit down to do it.  That's when the mind goes completely blank and any specific, insightful, cut-through-all-the-irrelevant-issues-key words floating around in your head earlier are completely gone and the only thing you can come up with is: US Constitution.  You may as well start a search for the blue prints of NASA's Rover with "telescope."  Then, when you finally get on a roll, nothing seems impossible.  You could write the whole assignment in 12 minutes!  No one's going to find these perfect, spot-on cases!  Certainly not in the time you've found them!    Ultimately, you have to sort through the mountains of paper you've amassed because you've printed off everything that could, in any way, possibly be interpreted to bear a vague resemblance to what the initial subject was.  And, inevitably, as the sorting, shifting, organizing begins, you realize that none, or very little, of it relates to the manifesto growing at rapid pace in your mind.  Then it hits you:  you're going to have to read all these cases to determine which ones actually apply to the assignment, regardless of what thoughts passed through your mind at first impression.    "Where's that ONE I KNOW applies?"  You ask yourself, frantically throwing unstapled papers around your desk.  "Just ONE!!  That's all I need!"  But the ONE is lost forever in the pile of other ONEs; they've lost all relevance and you have no choice but to take them all home, examine each in kind to determine just how much more work you have now compared to how much you had when you walked in 7 hours ago.    In the meantime, however, I was able to forget Friday night's disappointment, if only for a few fleeting moments.  Tuesday will be the true test, though.  Only then will I know for sure where I stand.  Just wish I knew for sure where I  want  to stand!

      I almost had a date tonight.  Actually, fuck "almost"; I  had  a date, for about half an hour.  It was going to be perfect.  Here I'd spent all last semester waiting for the right time, perfect place, best opening line, trying to calm my fears of rejection and step out of my comfort zone for once...Once!!  And today, I finally took that chance.  There have been signs all along.  She tried to hide her affection beneath a surly, tough exterior, but I saw beyond that.  We joked about the old hometown, laughed at how much we secretly wanted each other.  But underneath, I knew we were laughing about something real.    We planned to meet for beers, and those only lead to bad places; I was counting on it.  I figured such an invitation would be obvious in its entreaty.  After all, we "joked" that our movie and dinner the day after our last final was a date.  Clearly she was sending me signals that she was ready and waiting for me to initiate the next step.  Any remaining shards of doubt vanished when we had our lunch together this afternoon.  It was glorious.  We bonded; we shared things few others knew.  I looked at her; she looked at me.  She finished my olives, for god's sake!  If that's not a come-on, I don't know what is!  So when she called half an hour after our arrangements were made, I was excited.  I thought perhaps she couldn't wait to see me and wanted to move our plans up a bit; or maybe she had to tell me something too difficult to discuss in person.  I tried to sound nonchalant, telling her I was just "reading the newspaper" when I was actually admiring her picture in the law school's directory, as I have a tendency to do quite often, when all my life seems to shrink and the darkness curls up around me.    "Listen, uhh.." she said.  It sounded serious.  My heart was pounding; this was it!!  "...I have bow out of tonight."  Crushing.  Tumbling down a rocky mountain-side onto a torn, jagged terrain not entirely unlike the broken floor of Mordor.    "Oh?" I recovered quickly.    "Yea, I forgot about this thing I'm doing with Mark tonight."  Oh yes, this "Mark" person.  She refers to him on occasion, calling him her "live-in."  It's not entirely certain he even exists.  But I remained calm.    "Okay."  Did that sound too pained?  "We'll definitely do it another time, though," she offered.  Was that hope I heard in her voice?    "Alrighty."  Like when you finally find the courage to admit the truth?!  Such was my date that wasn't.  I'll go on, somehow.  Probably get some coffee next door to the bar that was to be the site of our meeting.  But I won't go in, oh no.  Maybe come home and console myself with Queer As Folk's Season Two on DVD.    But I don't plan on letting myself get this hurt again, not for a very long time.

      The reading assignment for Contracts was the one-year provision and suretyship provision of the Statue of Frauds.  What did I read?  The one-year and suretyship provisions cases.  What did we cover in class this morning?  The Memorandum requirement and reliance exception cases.  It was a painful 50 minutes.  Hopefully my notes will make sense after I've read those two cases.  If not, my life is over.  Ruined.    Doesn't feel like Friday.  Probably because there's so much to do.  And no, I can't just leave those cases to be read over the weekend.  They have to be read (and understood) today!!  No falling behind here, that's for damn sure.  Besides, there's already plenty to keep me busy over the three-day weekend.  Reading, briefing and researching the new paper assignment.  Yay.    But enough bitching.    Your favorite moments were lovely, commentors.  I may have to do my own list of specific moments that will live forever, but, alas, not this day.  I have something of greater importance to discuss this day.  I'm working on the track list for a new mix tentatively titled the Spring (April/May) Mix.  The list's coming along nicely, adding a few songs here and there each day.  Noticed, though, that the artists are primarily women.  Shocker.  Such is usually the problem I encounter when constructing a new CD.  So I had this idea:  maybe I could get someone to help put this thing together.  Turn it into a joint-venture type of project.  There's no mystery about who I'm thinking should join me in this adventure.  He's good at male mixes, I'm good at female mixes, we create great projects together, so why not expand our talents?    Whatdya think, honey?  Wanna make a mix together?  It could be risky, and our friendship may suffer great trauma as a result, but isn't it worth a chance?  A chance at greatness?  A chance of creating the ultimate, best Spring Mix the world has ever seen???

      ...in no particular order...  Shifting into fourth gear on an open backroad.  The sound of my yoga instructor's voice.  Meeting my boyfriend's eyes, smiling the smile we unknowingly reserve for each other, and returning to our own activities without saying a word.  The sound of Lorraine, Levi, Carrie, Susan, Mom, Dave, Jen laughing after they've surprised themselves with their own humor.  Watching the sun rise while writing morning pages.  Passion-induced cat naps.  Balancing the book and cup of hot tea while sitting comfortably in the bowl chair with my feet on the futon.  Finding a favorite place for the first time.  Walking into and out of the law school building.  Snuggling into my old bed in the basement.  Waking up in my bed next to the highway.

      The good mood seems to be holding as we round the day's mid-point.  The four-hour power session went smoothly, even though it was a bit rough getting back into the rhythm of taking notes for Contracts.  Yikes!  Statute of Frauds, indeed.  One day, many removed from this one, I may explain the rule to you.  The Criminal Law class, however, looks promising indeed.  We love criminals!  But only the ones we read about in textbooks.  Actual ones aren't our friends.  Unless they are.  How's that for legal maneuvering for you?  I have a new nickname:  Nothing But Trouble.  I don't understand why I have this new designation, but I'll take it, own it and be proud of it just the same.  Don't even try to stop me.  Suppose it's a good thing I'm already a fan of the Pink song.  I'm harassing, too, but we won't get into that; trying to change that perception of myself, and all.    So now the day's down to reading for tomorrow, which is just more Criminal Law stuff, none of which I have to brief...Yah!  And that's always a good place to be; especially before 3 or 4 or 10!

      Morning, blogger!  Have 20 minutes before my first class, but just felt like posting something before the day begins.  Who knows what kind of mood I'll be in after four (4) hours of class/Internet database research training/Professional Conduct lecture by the Dean/another class, so I better post something to commemorate my good mood.    As you can probably tell, they didn't really miss a beat with the return to school.  And while that fact had me questioning my existence last night, today I feel ready to tackle whatever they may (and will) throw at us, as long as I can have my Grape Nuts and coffee in the morning, and Yoga and tea at night.  God, I DO sound earthy!  I'll have to start drinking more beer, I guess.    Final word on the GPA: 2.83.    My friend Dan's over here chatting with me.  Say Hi Dan:  hi i am writing for andrea she is wicked smart.  Says he who has a GPA in the 3-point range.    "3.42, actually," he corrected me.  "He's such an arrogant little prick."  "No, Dan, I wouldn't say that.  But I'll type it."  Alrighty...off to class.  Wish us luck.

      Feeling like posting again, but don't really have anything majorly coherent to say, so I'll just ramble, m'kay?    Yoga is our friend.  Just finished a 45-minute practice with the Double Diamond mix going throughout...so great.    The DVD player's clickiness stops when I let a CD play all the way through--even the burned CDs.  Interesting.  Squishy doesn't scream when she's ready to be emptied, but the steady stream of steam lets me know just as effectively.  The candle Mike gave me for Christmas last year burned its last flame tonight during said Yoga practice.  Thanks, little guy; you smelled great.  Another has taken its place on the top of the bookshelf.  It's introducing itself to Trudi right now.  Read the first 50 pages of A Civil Action earlier.  It felt cheap and dirty because I wasn't reading the book I've been craving ever since I began reading it, but it's time will come, if I ever get off this damn computer.  They went pretty fast, those pages.  Vaguely remember the movie, and can already say with absolute certainty that the book is better.  It's required reading for Civil Procedure, believe it or not.  Think I'll go add some sugar and milk to my Chai tea; it's one of my newest faves.  Tea!  Who knew?!

      The last of the grades came through today:  Civil Procedure: A-  (YIIIPPPPIIIIEEEE!!!!!!)  Contracts: C (Which is quite good, really.  Exactly what I anticipated and not as low as I feared.)  Research and Writing Paper a.k.a the only graded assignment for the semester: A- (see the Civ Pro comment)  KICK ASS!!!!  Nice little finish to the day, semester, year.  The class standings will be out in February, but I'm not too worried about them.  My GPA will be higher than 2.0 and that's worth getting drunk over.  Not that I'm going to, that is.  Have Property first thing tomorrow morning, after all.    Had a really good day even before checking out the grades.  Spent the day running errands and getting started on the reading for this week.  Three hours of Criminal Law reading at the Daily Grind always puts a gal in a good mood.  Especially when the spectrum of the 36 pages spanned from loud yelling at a parade to the constitutionality of same-sex sodomy; Yay!  And can I just say: one of the reasons I love this town so is the fact that it feels like March in January.  March will no doubt feel like December, but for now, it's a nice switch.

      So the day started kinda poopy.  Couldn't shake the overall gloom and pouting-to-China attitude I adopted last night.  Usually, I really enjoy being back in my own space, getting back to its natural sparkle and charm.  But this time, I just missed the break and the folks I spent it with.  Thank god for morning pages, I tell you what!  Had too damn much to get done today to be doing it in a mood!  So yea, as each line of the three pages filled, the little black cloud above my angelic head dissipated, leaving nothing but a bright, sunny ball of sunshine in its wake.    And I've been really productive to boot.  Completed two loads of laundry, cleaned my apartment, hung the new wall decorations (which kick serious ass, thanks to that fabulous man of mine), had my chipped windshield (that wasn't really chipped, had a bug baked on...oops!) to the windshield doctor and chatted with a favorite journalism professor.  Yay.  And it's only five!  Think I'll put the trip to campus off until tomorrow.  Get to buy a $100 book and see about health insurance.  Damn turning 23 anyway!    The sulkiness of the morning reminded me of this day last year.  (Come on, you knew it wasn't going to end that quietly, didn't you?)  This was the day of my big departure/inevitable return, and there's only one way to commemorate it properly.     Sunday, January 12    We all awoke on time.  There was no time for laziness today; we needed to get to the train station by 10, although if something prevented us from reaching it in time, it wouldn't have broken my heart.  Each stop on the Tube lasted an eternity, bringing me closer to the last place I wanted to go, but also not going quickly enough.  The frantic pace of life was returning, and I fought to hold onto the patient, relaxed lesson I learned in the city streets.   I have to remember how to do this when I get home   The process of saying goodbye was made all the more difficult because the three of us had, by the end of my stay, formed a cohesive union.  At dinner the night before, Grant and I finally looked into each other's eyes and laughed the laugh of friends, a slice of understanding sliding into place.  It had been decided that I would make the journey to the airport by myself, so this station was to be the site of our farewell.     I love the sound of his footsteps behind me, listening to their sighs and laughter.   "Have a safe trip back and a safe drive back to school.  Let me know you get there okay," he said to my hair as we hugged.  "I will."  It was the last thing I wanted to think about at the moment.  "I'm glad I got to meet you Grant, and I can't wait 'til next time."  "You too.  The train's getting ready to leave, get your ass on!"  And he shoved me aboard.  Then we waited.  I took a seat next to the platform so we could make faces and over-dramatic gestures to each other, laughing so as not to cry.     I smell the white room, and can feel him tapping my back in time with the music.  Wonder if I'll still be able to smell this city on my scarf in a month.   They ran with the train as it pulled away, creating entertainment for my fellow passengers and a perfect memory for me.   Grant was right--Coke does taste better over here.   Yay.  You can all celebrate now; no more London essay.  But it'll always be part of you now, don't even try to fight it.

      Never recognize this place when I return from a break.  It's the damnedest thing.  Drive for hours across one or more states to drag myself from my car, down the hallway, through the door and it always looks completely strange...as though something huge is obviously out of place or missing, but, because I haven't been around to monitor each inanimate object's activities in the last few weeks, I can't tell exactly what.  "They've been up to something, I can tell."  But as soon as my ass hits the futon and my hand grasps my faithful remotes once again, the wave of "home" washes over me.  Probably won't know where I am when I wake in the morning; but I'll stumble into the kitchen, flip the coffee switch and it'll come back to me eventually.  Have two days to get organized before classes resume, for which I'm very thankful.  Think I may do some wall-covering redecorating tomorrow.  Or maybe I won't even get out of bed.    The transition to my tiny abode has been a bit shakier this time, as I didn't have miles and miles of Montana highway on which to reflect on the break and shift into Moscow-mode.  The Boise route shaved an hour off the overall travel-time, but it feels twice as long; you have to pay attention to those damn curvy roads!  Who knew?  So I find myself missing the quiet cave of a den we called my room in the basement.  The apartment's quite a bit toastier than the cave, but the mountain fortress surrounding it more than compensated.

      And thus, the break ends.  Doesn't feel like break anymore, really.  Became so used to waking up late, lazily sipping coffee, showering before noon if that's what the fates decided, and if not, that was okay too, that the concept of "going back" seems foreign.  Back to what?  Isn't this what life is now?  Not so much, no.  But I love that I loved this break so much.  Very relaxing, very restful.  Everything a good break should be and more.  Will have two days before school begins to reconnect with my cute apartment with positive vibes...Yay.  Probably will get nasty with the plants, too.  Might even finish a book or two, never know!  Joe and I are braving the Boise route tomorrow morning.  Wonder if he'll make it home tonight before 12.  Wonder if he'll stop when I need to pee.  We've never left on the same day, so this whole caravan thing could be interesting, indeed.  The last time we traveled together, his car ended up needing $3,000 worth of repairs.  Hopefully being in separate cars will improve our record.

      So, I'm going to edit the post below, because it's too great to be so rough around the edges, grammar-wise.  Plus, I forgot to mentioned that Grandma kept asking about Levi after my short, to the point answers followed by subject changes.  "Levi really is a nice young man.  We enjoyed meeting him the other night, especially after hearing about him for so long."  "Yea, it was.  Too bad the birthday party had to be cancelled, everyone could have met him that night.  This place gets a lot of natural, light, doesn't it?"  "Has anything developed beyond friendship with him?"  "No."  "Is anything likely to develop."  "No."  "Just friends, then?"  "Yea, I think that's why we get along so well.  Here comes Dad!  Yay!"

      I need a nap.    Or a beer.  Guess I'll make do with my Apple Cinnamon tea, instead.   Left the Grandparents' new house around 1, finished lunchy with Dad around 2, and have just now arrived at Mocha Madness (for said tea and wireless internet) at nearly 4 after running all of two, count 'em TWO errands.  I'll tell you the story slowly, as I check my email, other blogs, and unwind in general.  It's not a great tale of harrowing woe, but it'll make good blog fodder.  Should actually be getting home soon, as the fam's going out to dinner this evening, but a little decompression will feel good.  Maybe I should do some Yoga in the bathroom.  Deep inhalation, and:  It all began, innocently enough, at the mountain fortress.  The day was bright, shiny, the snow was thawing, I couldn't pull myself out of bed and wasn't about to apologize for it.  Told Dad I'd meet him out at the New House when I arose because I wasn't going out with him at 9.  Haven't seen the Grandparents since the New Year's Day dinner with the boy, and knew I had to see them before the big departure.  The day's weather was just what I needed to carry me out to Chubuck with a smile on my face and a song in my heart.  Had a nice chat with Grandma about aunts, cousins and the like.  We snuck a box out to my car to be taken to the local "donations for poor people" drop off, as well as a box of old books she'd decided were nothing but dust collectors.    (Aside: a very butch looking lesbian came in a few minutes ago and hasn't taken her eyes off me yet.  At least, I hope it's a lesbian.  Don't have my glasses on, so it's anybody's guess.)  Anyway, offered to take the boxes off Grandma's hands, thinking I could score some dollars at the local used bookstore.  Not much, mind you, because used book dealers are the tightest bunch of people on the face of the earth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.   So Dad broke free of Grandpa's hold on him in the garage; they were, literally, waiting for paint to dry and Dad just as soon do it at home, but not before buying me lunch.  Yay.    (Update on the aside: definitely a butch lesbian, she just went in the women's bathroom.  She reminds me of April. [An old friend, not the month.]  Looks as if she's waiting for someone.  Hmmm.)  I had my plan all worked out:  I'd start on the south end of town and work my way up.  Try to unload the books in Old Town, stop by the local used CD store to pick up the No Doubt Singles album, drop off the free stuff for poor people and end up back at the mall to purchase some shoes Mom and I have waited since November to go on sale.  (They never have, but I'm sick of waiting.)  Then, because I'd still be in such a great mood with plenty of time and just enough money, I'd drive across town again to spend quality blogging time in the attempted-trendy coffee shop.  Super.  Well, here's what actually happened:  I did start on the south end of town, only to find the store I was looking for turned into a music store.  Never one to be deterred, I immediately sought out the other used book store; it's not on the complete other side of town, but it is on the other side of the tracks.  But on the way, I got my new CD, and we love those.  Nearly forgot about the poor people's shit in my trunk until I was at the turn off.  Swung Harley around to just make it, then realized I was on the wrong block.  It was only one more up, not a big deal.  Did the same circle again, plus the extra block, only to realize it was another block up.  Did the same circle again, adding the extra-extra block, only to realize it was yet another block up.  By this time, Hella Good wasn't magic anymore.  Thank god the guy at the front desk of Poor People R Us was nice.   Now I just had to unload my box of random 40 year old hardcover and paperback gems.  I didn't want to have to go where I was headed, but I couldn't quite remember why.  Thought I was just being harsh and elitist, where my tendencies have been known to lean.  As I lumbered up the stairs, navigated the front door and hoisted the box on the desk and heard the owner's first word to me, I remembered why.  "No," she said, without an ounce of humor.  I smiled my "you better be fucking kidding me" smile and said: "Really?  You're going to tell me that after I've carried all these in here?  You're just going to say 'no'?"  "I don't take hardcovers."  As if that offered any real explanation.  "There are others in there, too."  As she sorted, trying not to touch too many of them, as if in fear of what she'd catch, I tried to find a happy place by looking around the store.  Recognized the woman in the romance novel section, hands spilling over with 200 page-rs.    "I'll take this copy of '1492', but these others are in such poor condition, I'm not going to take them."  I tried to reconcile the lack of creased spines, and torn edges, absence of yellowed pages, and intense old-book smell in my offerings with her inventory's dusty, mite-infested, dog-slobber glazed standouts, and instead listened as her friend mentioned the other used book store in town, the one  I'd just finished searching for.  "Oh," I said, trying not to throw a fit, "didn't it go out of business?  I was just over there."  "Oh no," the friend said, "he just relocated; he's only about four blocks up from his other store."  "Do you know what his policy is on buying?" I asked the proprietor, letting her know HE would be getting my business.    "I haven't any idea.  But I know he only sells for garage-sale prices."  She started walking behind her desk to start the paperwork on '1492', the most-creased-spined book in the bunch.  "Alrighty, I'll head on over there then."  "And I don't sell, I only trade."  "I'll be taking that with me then," I said as I reached for the nearly-ill-fated little book.  Dropped the box right in the middle of her floor as I struck up a conversation with the woman I recognized.  She's an old friend of my parents, with whom we spent many summer weekends camping.  Her husband owned the mechanic's shop Dad brought Joe and I to when we were kids and forbade us from touching or playing with anything.  We prank called 911 instead.  It was nice to chat, though, and be in the way of the store's owner as long as possible.    (Update: Butch's friend finally arrived; she looks like Athletic Barbie.  Hmmm.)  And so, armed once again with my box of books, I went in search of my original destination.  Had a mini repeat of the search for the Poor People's Palace, during which I cursed the No-Hardcovers-Here lady many a time.  Once I found my way inside, I took a deep breath and began again:  "You buy books?"  "What kind of books?"  "Old ones."  Gave him the story.  (They moved, need to get rid of shit, not looking to make a bunch of money.)  "Well, I only buy books people will want to read.  I won't buy them because they're old."  "I'll go get them."  He took more than I expected, and mostly the hardcovers (HA! SUCK ON THAT!).    Eight dollars (it would have been more, had they not mostly been book club buys) later, I took my significantly lighter load across the street to the bohemian coffee shop where I spent yesterday afternoon people-watching, writing and reading.  "Would you like some books?" I oh-so-generously asked the owner.  He gave me a weary look and said, "Uh."  Repeated the story and his tune changed to "Oh!"  "This seems like the best place for them, I think.  They're perfect for laying around and getting flipped through on occasion."  Just get them out of my sight!!!  "Oh sure!  There's a library in the back for the more progressive students."  "There ya go."  "You know who else might like them?"  OH I KNOW!!!  "The guy across the street?"  "Yea."  "He's already thinned them out.  These are just for you."  That box isn't the only thing thinned out today!  But it has a good home now, and purging myself of the story has done its job.  Never did get to my shoes; think that'll make a good outing for Mom and me tomorrow.  They might have a secret Saturday sale, too, you never know.  She does though, because "those Dillard's people are bastards!"

      Thought about it, though.  Instead, I'll just reference the trip occasionally.  Like right now.  Today was the day we ventured to the ghetto seeking THE Dew Drop Inn.  THE ONE.  In the song (Muhammad, my friend [from Boys from Pele--that's all the hints you're getting]).  A gay piano bar.  In London; her old stomping grounds.  It had to be the one.  We were afraid it would be so hip, so cool, so  her  that we'd only be able to leave a candle and our nose prints mashed up against the window.  We were right, but in all the wrong ways.    We should have brought a candle, but as a memorial.  We did leave our nose prints on the window, but only in an effort to see around the boards and drawn curtains.  We left feeling very sad, disbelieving and broken.  So we went to Harrod's.    Exactly three months later, I told her the story and she laughed kindly: "Yea, that's not it."  Dew Drop Inn is code for "Let's get the fuck outta here."  Simple mistake.  Anyway, that was also the day we roamed through Hyde Park, thinking about the next (potentially last) semester and the great unknown waiting.  Don't think I would have imagined a year later turning out like it has.  And that makes me smile.

      The first posted grade:  Property (drum roll) B-  Cue applause.  Suppose there won't be any 4.0 to be had this semester, but it's higher than the average, and that's just fine by me.

      An angry email, an angry-turned-to-revelations hurried conversation and finally a conversation full of open, honest communication later, I think we're doing just fine.  It always does the trick.    "So, you wanna get a room Friday?"  "Sure."  That helps, too.  And, as promised, today's the year anniversary of a great, great day in the lives of two young (and not so young) people and a few celebrities on the side.   Tuesday, January 7    In the morning, I dressed for the theater.  The plan was to spend the day in museums and the evening enjoying Rent.    "Looks like it"s just gonna be me and you today."  I looked up from my Corn Flakes/Bran Flakes/Rice Krispies mix, questioning, trying not to look as excited as I was.  "Grant's not feeling too great, so he's going to stay here and rest."  "So I guess I better change, huh?"  On the Tube heading into the city, a thought occurred to me.  "How long is that Gillian play going to be here?"  "'Til February, why?"  "Well, I'd really like to see something I can only see here, you know?  I can see Rent in Spokane whenever I want."  "That would be really great, actually.  Grant doesn't care to see it and you didn't say anything when I mentioned it before, so I just figured I'd miss it."  "Well, let's not do that anymore, k?  Let's get tickets for tonight and just do it."  "Super!"  After a stop at Starbucks and a chuckle about Virginia Woolf's Burgers, Pastas, and Grills restaurant, we made our way to the British Museum.    The museum is the center of  the literary district of Bloomsbury, and has served as a haven for all kinds of hippies and communists, from Gandhi to Karl Marx, to George Orwell, Charles Dickens, and Virginia herself.  They all holed up (not necessarily at the same time) in the giant reading room at the museum; their names, and those of other such strangers, inscribed on the walls of the library bring the history of the establishment and the city home in a way dry historical facts and dates just can't.    The distinct aroma of the city does the same thing. The air is rich and full there.  Full of industry, food, busy people, history and life.  It's immediately noticed, quickly adapted to, and eventually missed.  It goes quite well with coffee and perspiration, the kind one accumulates after walking all over hell and back every day for a week.   "I'm getting the feeling that there's no way we're going to get through all there is to see here, so just show me the highlights."  "Oh, don't worry," he said over his shoulder.  First was the Egyptian halls, filled with statues, relics and sarcophaguses from centuries past.  The shadowy sense of the city's life that whispered to me from the beginning solidified as I ran my fingers across the bottom of 3,000 year old works.  The day before, we admired portraits painted during the 1400s, now we were standing in front of products of 1400 BC.  We were standing in a hall of legends, surrounded by gods and kings, and talking to each other felt like an interruption of whatever wisdom they were imparting to us.  In hushed whispers:  "Over here's the Rosetta Stone."  "Oh really?  Kick ass!"  Pause.  "Remind me again of the importance?"  "Well, when the explorers came to Egypt, this is what they used to translate the markings in the pyramids and such.  There are three different languages written on it, so when they found this, they knew how to read Egyptian writing."  "Oh, right.  I get it now."  "Wanna check out some Greek stuff?"  Panels and statues from the Parthenon in Athens lined the walls, and my appreciation for the Greeks was sufficiently renewed.  We were finally shooed away from mummified bodies, pets, internal organs and food as the museum's closing time quickly approached.    With an hour to spare before the play, we searched for a quick dinner back in Leicester Square.  The screams of the crowd alerted Levi to the lights and posters.  "Oh, this is the 'Gangs of New York' premiere," again with the "this happens all the time over here tone."  Not truly expecting anything grand, we made our way over, just for the sake of gawking.  But as more time passed, the more real the idea became that we might actually see someone.  Accordingly, we forfeited our dinner and found a space, mashed against fellow onlookers, trying to conserve heat on the blustery winter night, waiting for important cars to arrive.  First was Harvey Weinstein, looking like Jabba the Hut, in true Hollywood fashion-cell phone in hand and all.    Martin Scorsese arrived with very little bombast, in a mini-van, no less.  The next recognizable star was Daniel Day-Lewis.  Now we were down to two, only caring about one.  "We can leave when Cameron gets here, really."  We watched as the clock ticked closer and closer to 7.  "We need to leave by 7:10, and that's all there is to it," his voice of reason declared.  "Jesus, I can't feel my fingers."  As the tension mounted and cars pulled in, the crowd was sure this was her.  It had to be.  As I readied my camera lens, I listened carefully to catch the person's identity.  Finally, I heard his chuckling voice behind me:  "Oh ... It's Joan Collins."  "What the hell is Joan Collins doing here?  Acting like this is her damn movie?"  The next round of cars arrived quickly and suddenly Leo was there, in a mob of other men in suits, looking more gorgeous than he had any right to.  It quickly became apparent that Cameron was a lost cause, so we headed to the theater and Gillian.  Arriving in time to buy the essentials: chips, water, poster and program, we brushed by glamorous, sophisticated, important-looking people and claimed our discount sixth row seats.   I'm so glad I changed out of my fancy, theater-going clothes this morning.   The show itself was quite phenomenal, living up to the hype of the day, and the evening's entertainment breezed by in what felt like a few minutes.  As we gathered our bearings outside, preparing for the journey home, he noticed the line.  As we took our place, the man announced:  "It'll be just a minute; here's the deal: One item per person and nothing from the 'X-files.'"  After a few good gasps and jokes, and before the enormity really hit us, the line began moving toward the small redhead in the doorway.  She seemed really exhausted, but still gracious when forced to endure bad play-referencing jokes made by star-struck American strangers.   And it's only Tuesday!  If everything had gone according to plan, I'd be flying back tomorrow, and I doubt we would've spent this evening out on the town.   Yay.  Told you it would be good.    And just out of sheer randomness and end/beginning of the year shit I'm a week late for, here's a list of all the books I read during 2003:  The Truth Is... Melissa Etheridge's Autobiography: B+ (I had to have something to take my mind off the fact I wasn't yet in London, thanks to the fucking Passport people!)  Mysteries of Pittsburgh by Michael Chabon: A+  The Watchmen by Alan Moore: A (Yes, I'm counting a graphic novel as a 'regular' book, deal)  The Lord of the Rings: A (The whole thing!!)  Good Omens by Neil Gaiman: A++ (Bought at a used book fair along the Thames, oh yea)  The Alchemist by I forgot the guy's name: A (We love enlightenment in fable form!)  Personal History by Katharine Graham: B (Began to love journalism more after I'd graduated from it)  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay by Michael Chabon: no grade high enough (It's become part of my very existence.)  The Hours by Michael Cunningham: A+ (Such great writing, insights, humor and wisdom packed into a book you can read in one sitting; gotta love it!)  The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron: A (Two of my favorite gals in one name!)  Supreme Injustice by some legal scholar/analyst: B+ (Stupid presidential appointments, anyway)  Beauty and the Beast by some frump without a life: embarrassing guilty pleasures don't get graded (Remember that show?  What a gem)  A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius by Dave Eggers: A+ (Nothing to say, really, just read the book)  Endless Nights by Neil Gaiman: A+ (see the note after The Watchmen)  McSweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales, edited by Michael Chabon: B-  Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier: A   As you were...

      Found a first edition copy of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay in the Idaho Falls Barnes & Noble yesterday, the day of the Boy's departure.  Most of you probably don't understand the significance of such a find, but trust me, it's full of significance.  Now I just have to find the receiver of my other copy; wonder who it'll be....

      Is anybody sick of this stuff yet?  No?  Alrighty then!   Monday, January 6 	   The three of us started the day's adventures off right with Starbucks in Leicester Square.  The den of materialism and overstuffed sofas was to be our only coffee shop visited in London, our not-all-that-closeted elitism showing just a bit.  Soon enough, though, we found ourselves back in the city, heading into the gritty mean-streets of the Soho district, historically renowned for its debauchery and drug dens.    The neighborhood has evolved into the hip, happenin' fashionably bohemian and supremely gay heart of London.  The "heart" is basically two streets lined with sex shops, boutiques with sex shops downstairs, bookstores with sex shops downstairs and restaurants flying the rainbow flag.  I'm sure they had their own version of downstairs sex shops, though.    Heading toward the more sophisticated, more cleanly, National Portrait Gallery, we took a hurried stroll through a decidedly Asian community.  The population suddenly shrunk in stature, and nearly every storefront had Asian writing and dead chickens in the window.    "Is this like London's Chinatown?"  "No, this is more like ChinaBackAlley."  "Thank you, Grant."   That's it!  The trip's first iconic joke!  We might just be able to have a smooth ride, after all.   Tomorrow's really good, just you wait.

      Happy Tuesday blogger!  Thought I'd try an on-site posting today in the only coffee shop in town I like to spend extended periods of time; plus, they have free wireless Internet!  Yay!  Slept late again today.  Don't think the 9 a.m. mornings will be sticking around.  Although, I do have a hair appointment tomorrow at noon, so I'll at least have to be up before 11.  Done a lot of thinking so far today.  Wrote three morning pages, the first in about as many weeks, which felt good.  But there appears to be more to say.  Thought I'd post what was happening across the pond last year today, and I probably will get to that on account of the feeling I have to just sit and write and write and write.  Initially, thought I'd just fiddle around on the fast connection here, sip on my gourmet Mocha and read a bit to fill my afternoon.  Then I talked to Lorraine.  And now, all I want to do is write.    We'll get to the conversation in a minute, but I'm more anxious to explore the thoughts the conversation's aftermath brought up.  They've been lurking about in the back of my head for a few days now, brought to life by Natalie's observation in Charley's last week:  "Maybe you should try being a bit more supportive" and the discussion Levi and I had the other day:  "It just seems you always have these bleak, cynical conclusions."  "How many times have I been wrong?"  "Good point.  I just would rather have a bit more optimism."  "I'm not usually disappointed."  "True.  I guess I'd rather have the experience and keep up some hope; it's worth the disappointment."  Seem to go through these every once in a while.  And I'd like to think they help me discover a bit about myself I'd rather see handled in a different way and the process of making that come about begins.  But days like this make it seem as though I'm a long way away from the person I'd like to be.  Understanding, patient, accepting, fun and easy to be around.  Not someone to be handled or tip-toed about.  Then I feel completely over-dramatic and self-indulgent in my "Oh why can't I be who I wish I was!!" self-analysis.  Maybe what's bothering me the most is the feeling that I was on my way to being all those things all the time during the first part of the year.  As has been referenced before, the London trip taught me a great deal about letting go, having patience, etc. and I made an effort to apply those lessons upon my return to everyday life.  Once school started this fall, though, and time and energy became sparse, I think I may have slipped back into an old routine.  My critical eye, honed for any indication of red-flags or warning signs, did well for me in the classroom, but perhaps not in terms of my attempt at becoming a more centered, balanced (see the adjectives above), individual.  I tell myself that looking at my thoughts, actions, etc. is a good sign in itself, but I'm hesitant to be too self-congratulatory.  Sigh.  Processing, indeed.  That's what she's been doing since reading Saturday's post.  Had about 20 minutes to talk about it this afternoon.  She doesn't recognize me anymore.  She hadn't seen this side of me.  She didn't think I'd be this pissy once we began speaking again.  Told her we're in very similar places because I haven't recognized her for months.  Talked more about what the last 6 weeks meant, that they were about letting her go, being okay with her absence in my life; letting the connection we've shared for so long become something new by releasing the grasp on what it's always been.  On my birthday she told me the time apart taught her about self-control, patience and faith; that it was harder than she ever thought it would be and how incredibly relieved she was that I'd finally called her because she didn't think she could make it through the day without emailing me a "Happy Birthday" wish.  Today she told me the break eventually felt good; she began to enjoy the lack of contact and at some point quit missing me.   "So why didn't you tell me that when I asked?"  "I don't know."  Last week, before she knew how I felt, it seemed like nothing had changed, that I'd undergone a process of...well, processing, but I'd left her in that October place.  Today, after she read how I feel, it sounded like she'd arrived at the place I've been waiting for her, had always been here, and why am I so pissy now that I'm here too?  I just wish I knew which one was the truth.  Wish I knew how much of the situation is me and my bleak, cynical conclusions.  Wish I could use that razor-sharp analysis, which seems to oh-so-accurately pin-point the crux of everyone else's problems/incidents/etc., to asses my own life's wonders.    At the beginning of the conversation, she asked if I'd like to meet her if she came to town Friday.  The thought initially made me hesitate and pull back.  Now I'm thinking it may not be a bad idea.  Assuming she still wants to, that is.

      Keeping up with this whole "last year at this moment, we were" thing we've got going, here's today's entry.  Hope you enjoy it, but I really don't care if you don't.  Editor's  note: the original text has been livened up a bit; look for the comments in parentheses (like this).   Saturday, January 4, 2003   "I have no idea what I want to see, hon, so you're gonna have to take me where I want to go."   First stop was Piccadilly Circus.  It reminded me of Times Square in New York, not that I'd ever been there,  (even though I had in 9th grade)  but the bustle of tourists armed with cameras and natives on their way to somewhere else reminded me of TV's depiction of the nervecenter.  And at the same time, it was unlike anything I'd ever seen in the States.  (except Nebraska [and I honestly haven't been there at all])   The buildings we walked by were older than the Declaration of Independence  (and smelled like it too)  and they let me feel their presence as we passed.  The juxtaposition of such history mashed together with Burger King and Tower Records stores represented London's crazed meshing of the present's frenzied need to rush and the past's patient wisdom.      We made our way through central London with a vague concept of destination, not really bothering to know for sure.  The theater district of Leicester Square required a gawk or two and a picture of the site of the "Two Towers" premiere.  (because we may have forgotten the movie's importance in the two days since we'd seen it for the second time)   "You know that Gillian Anderson girl?  She's in a play right over there,"  (foreshadowing, stay tuned)  Levi said, as though, during his time here, he'd hobnobbed with many such celebrities and now had to be reminded that the rest of us hadn't.    Eventually, we came to Trafalgar Square.     Okay, I know this place is important, but I'll be damned if I can remember why.   Apparently the plaza commemorates a great victory in 1805 of the English over that little French guy Napoleon.   Right, that ol' thing. 	  The pigeons in the square created a perfect British moment, especially when they all took to the late afternoon sky at the same moment.  "We're gonna get shit on."  (perfect character reference)   "Thank you, Grant."  "See that clock through there?" Levi pointed through the traffic, across the street, many blocks away.  "ThatÂs Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament."  "Hi Big Ben," I said, waving.  	    As we strolled along, making our way toward Buckingham Palace, we marveled at the uncharacteristically sunny weather, agreeing that the only thing that would make the day more perfect was if it was Sunday.  (and if Grant wasn't there)   I was still trying to wrap my mind around the fact that I was actually in London.  I'd not ever been off the North American continent before this, for crying out loud.  It was surprising how easily I gave up any sense of control, planning, or organizing each day.  Usually, I have a mentally-outlined schedule of my days.  Even the ones when nothing is happening; I have to plan what to do with the empty time.   But not here.  It was probably because the whole experience was so far beyond any other I'd had up to this point  (or all that E we did the night before);  I was too busy living and enjoying it to think about what came next.  (because if I had any idea, I'd have been pissed)   The frenzied nature of the present quickly faded away, and I let myself fall under this wise, old city's spell.

      And I think I have.    Feeling a bit nostalgic and melancholy today.  The most intense waves passed in the night, thank goodness.  Nearly cracked the first 100 pages of a new book, set in London, and found myself missing the city, that experience and 2003 intensely.  The year mark always changes things.  The realization that something truly is over, passed hits home in a new way.  The trip was such a great catalyst for the year in waiting and last night found me pouting over the fact that it's over.  Clearly nothing could top such a great year, especially not a new year making its debut in the snow incased fortress in Pocatello.  But a hot buttered rum at 2 in the morning always helps.  The fact that I haven't written pages in more than a few days may have something to do with it, as well.  They're all upstairs making noodles in the kitchen.  I'm sure they miss my presence immensely.  The countdown to the return back to school mirrors last year's countdown to the return back to the States.  Feels like I have a lot of time left to enjoy the break until I remember how fast the 10 days in London went by.  Tomorrow's the anniversary of the drive of harsh beauty.  Stupid January, anyway!  And then there's this girl.  I knew things would be different when the Age of Silence had passed, but I didn't think they'd be so similar.  Guess I didn't expect to feel this different.  Feel her trying to make everything okay, back to the way it used to be, at least in terms of our friendship-connection.  But the few times we've spoken I've felt like I've returned to something I worked to leave behind.  Something I don't need anymore, and have no intention of returning to.  And I feel like I'm the only one in that place, only one ready to see where the new places in each other's lives are rather than trying to fit into  the old ones in different ways.  Find myself getting sad, frustrated and then relieved because I remember that I don't need or want to figure it out.  Have to write about it, sure.  But am done worrying.  This will turn into something neither of us expected, for better or worse, without any pushing or pulling from me.    Sigh.  What can I say?   She's my wonderwall.

      A year ago at this moment, I was making my way through Gatwick Airport at the end of an 11 hour journey, watching the day begin for Britain.  Since nothing much is going on this year, other than the accumulating snow level and few escapes to movies, I thought I'd reminisce blog-style.     Thursday, January 2-Friday, January 3    The eleven hours of traveling didn't seem like such a big deal until hour 7.  Sleep was never an option, even if I hadn't been seated in the middle of the middle section of the 737.     And just what the hell is a landing card, anyway?  Will they let me off the plane without one?  That would be the perfect thing, really, especially after the passport fiasco.  Where did I put that damn thing again?  Now just calm down.  They're not going to send you back to the USA if you don't have your stupid landing card.   	  Somehow, time managed to pass and the flight attendants distributed "breakfast" around "5 a.m.," even though, to me, it was more like a midnight snack.  One hour to go; the butterflies were back and I couldn't sit still.  ~~~  Four days before he was to leave the country, Levi met his first love–Grant.  The last conversation Levi and I had while on the same continent detailed those four days and I couldn’t have been happier for him.	  Before he left, the seed had been planted in my mind for a visit, perhaps over Christmas break.  Not only would it be a great opportunity for me to see my first European country, but mostly, it would be a chance to visit my guy during his year away.  We often went months without seeing each other, and there were those couple of years in high school when we didn't speak at all, but now, a year was forever.  It wasn't as though we never communicated while he was in London; we were in better contact then than at any other time during our entire friendship.  Grant and I were the only people in the States he sent daily emails to, and I woke up early each morning during the fall and winter of 2002 to read and respond.    ~~~	  I knew they wouldn't be there when I arrived.  The Tube didn't open until 7, and they said something about having to take a train to get to the airport.  The time they'd built in to their schedule for me to secure my luggage, endure customs and such, evaporated as I found my suitcase immediately and breezed through the "Nothing to Declare" door.    Still, I scanned the anxious faces waiting at the end of the entryway, unable to actually make any of them out through the haze of excitement and exhaustion, hoping to hear a familiar gasp and shriek of "Honey!!"  When none came, I made my way to the change booth to get my hands on some British pounds.    	 Score.  Now when they get here, we can just go.  He'll be so impressed.   And so, armed with my new money and the sound of British conversations wafting through my mind, I waited.    I caught sight of Grant's short, blond, curly hair first.  I recognized him from the pictures; he dwarfed Levi's 6'4" frame by a good five inches.  I grinned and my palms sweated.     Holy god, he's tall.  Now where's my Levi?   He'd let his hair grow a bit shaggy.  Not too much, but just enough to give him that young European look I know he has a thing for.  Whenever I see him after a time apart, he always looks just a bit different.  It's most pronounced in the first moment, but then he always turns back into the boy I knew in 9th grade.   Levi looked everywhere but at me, and I just sat, grinning and waiting.  Finally, we locked eyes and I barreled into him for the first time in half a year.  	 "How are you?" he asked my neck, laughing.  "Oh, I’m okay!" I replied to his ear, my legs wrapped around his waist.   	 I was at last introduced to the boy who'd stolen my best friend's heart and the three of us were on our way.  "Let's get a drink!" I said, only half-kidding. 	 "You know, we could.  The pubs open around 10 here." 	 We were the only ones talking during the half hour train ride into London.    "We could dress up as nuns and go bar-hoppin'," Grant suggested. 	 "I love that movie!" I exclaimed.  "Anyone who can work 'Steel Magnolias' quotes into casual conversation must be alright.  We are sooo going to get along, Grant." 	 Watching the sun rise over the English countryside suddenly reminded me of exactly where I was.  This was an entirely different world, complete with its own unique color, aroma, sound and feel.  Even the laundry hanging on clotheslines had a decidedly English look to them.  Or maybe that was just the jet lag.    It was 10 a.m. (3 a.m. to my body) before we emerged from the Underground and I got my first real look at another continent.  The walk to the house was spent oohhing and aahhing over every cobblestone and car parked on the owner's front yard.    ~~~  It's an odd feeling, really, to be both refreshed and completely exhausted at the same time.  After my shower and an exchange of Christmas presents, I fought to keep my head up as I pecked away at my ham sandwich.  "Okay," Levi said, asserting his authority, "you really need to take a nap." 	 "Yea, I probably do.  I've been up for about 24 hours by now."  "Don't sleep too much, though, 'cause that'll throw you off even worse than not sleeping at all.  I'll come get you if you sleep too long."  	 I’m never going to get used to these stairs.   They were entirely too steep for a two-story house, but I hadn't the strength to complain; it was all being used in my effort to remain upright while navigating them.  It wasn't even a house, really.  It was half of a house.  Everything was small, shrunk down to half the normal size.  I wondered how the flat would be without the wall of separation between each side.  From the outside, the structure looked like a fairly large home, but because of that dividing line, everything inside was reduced to fit two households into one actual house.    The room they prepared for me was smaller than the dorm room I spent two years cramped in, and the only bed covering was a heavy comforter.  Everything was white: the walls, the furniture, and the door, making it difficult to imagine the dark night my body thought it should be.  I pulled a turtleneck on over my top and snuggled close to the radiator.  	 How can they not have a single hairdryer in this house?  So what if it was built over a century ago?  Circuit-breakers, my ass.     The fog lifted slowly as he sat with me later, waiting for the go-ahead on the night's activities.  My hair was still cold and wet.  My body ached and my stomach cramped.  From hunger or an adrenaline hangover, I wasn't sure.  But I was finally here.  We were together, and I wasn't about to lay here, waiting for it to feel normal, by god.   "I think I can do dinner," I decided.  "We'll have to see about the movie, though."  Halfway to the restaurant: "Fuck it.  It's the goddamned 'Towers' for god's sake.  We've waited long enough."

      Squishy burned me.  Bad Squishy.  But I feel initiated now, so I forgive Squishy.    Just finished a round of Yoga by twilight; come to really enjoy night practices.  They might make the leap to Moscow with me.  The boy and I are about to finish watching Nurse Betty.  Decided to have a Renee marathon after Cold Mountain.  Am liking Nurse Betty more than Chicago, I have to say.  I've been bitter about that movie since its initial release and have now been vindicated.  Yes, it was well done.  Yes, the actors all performed beautifully.  No, it was not better than Moulin Rouge, which every critic admitted in each review's opening paragraph.  And yet, the truly original, campy masterpiece was the red-headed bastard child of 2002's Oscar ceremony while it's safe, comfortable, more-refined looking younger sister walked away with 2003's Best Picture.  At least Nicole got even.  So it's 2004.  Yay.  Pretty unassuming number, really.  Next year will tear the shit up, I'm sure.  But this just gets to be one of those cute, quiet, standing in the corner, waiting for its moment of brilliance years.  Managed to have a great New Year's Eve.  It's always a question: whether the night will be as spectacular as is fabled (expected) to be.  Started at the third viewing of Return of the King; full circle and all.  Saw Fellowship on the first day of 2002, so it's only fitting that the last chapter be seen the last day of 2003.  Ended up at Charley's where the music was the same and the drinks were still free.  Moving even slower today than the last time we stayed out dancing until 2.  But managed to get pretty for dinner with the Grandparents.    "So what's my story?"  The boy asked around 5.  "Who am I?"  "What do you mean?"  "Well, what topics should I stay away from at dinner?"  "Don't mention you're an artist."  "Okay."  "Or that you're in graphic design."  "Okay."  "Grandpa will ask you if you're Jewish."  "And I'll have to say yes."  "Oh just be yourself, Levi!" Mom yelled from the living room.  "Yea, it'll be fine, honey, really."  "You think?"  "You're the boyfriend."  "I guess I should play the part."  Wonder what they think of their newest Grandson-in-Law-to-be.    He waited until they left before slapping my ass.  Mom and Grandma were discussing the poppyseed cake Grandma brought for dessert when the lightning storm began accompanying the blizzard.  The night suddenly became purple and we all gazed outside to catch a glimpse before the thunder followed.  Mom broke the awe-induced silence:   "You know, I've heard the weather has something to do with that."

      the law school's pretty barren.  Beat my goal to be here and working at 1030 by an hour and just rounded out the day's homework, 4 and a half hours later.  Wish I was ready for a nap, but instead, I'll catch up on reading emails and web surfing before heading home to pay some much needed attention to the rough edges of my apartment and my joints before settling in for the big, gay Oscar gala.  Very excited about that.    It's an odd feeling, really, when the weekend you thought would be a low-to-medium level of intensity turns out to be one of moderate-to-high level.  But accompanying the feeling of pride in accomplishing such a feat is the assurance that you realize you adapted and overcame without even realizing it.  To be sure, you bitched and moaned to yourself as you watched the hours evaporate into darkness of evening, but you never once considered stopping simply because you thought you'd be able to 3 hours ago.    The Spring Mix has played a large role in that process.  And no, I won't post the track list here.  You have to listen to both volumes all the way through before taking a peek at the tracks.  Them's the rules.  But I will say that it is a representation of and anthem for all the events, circumstances, evolutions happening right now.    Can't wait until we're flying down I-5, windows down, skin tanning over toned muscles, watching the skyline emerge from behind the curves, singing at the top of our voices with impossibly huge smiles claiming our faces.

      Finished with homework near 8 and felt completely defeated.  The cramps were making their comeback; wanted to write this damn story down, but felt too tired to even think about anything other than the first line.  Plus, the GLORIOUS Spring Mix didn't play well in the player during the outline-typing session.  He was right: it's not something that gets its first listen while working.  So, I planted myself on the couch with the headset, gathering my notebook and the other treats included in today's package near me and started over.  By the fouth song, I was ready to go.  Completley rejuvenated and loving every note.    Now on the 15th song of the 2nd disc and show no signs of stopping before giving it another listen.  In the meantime, here's what came of the 2nd go-round of the 1st disc:    On the corner of Pocatello Creek and Common Sense  	  "Did anyone bring anything?" I asked, crawling out of my red Chevy pickup truck, Ned, taking stock of the area I selected for the camping trip.  It wasn't the first time I'd been there.  Scoped it out on one of my many drives up Scout Mountain.  Ned at 45; Melissa blaring; thinking about being in love and imagining our life together when I blew out of this town and told the parents the truth in another life called college.  Remembering our first experiment with sex in the wilderness made me smile that night and I tried to mask it by making alcohol inquiry.     She's going to die when I tell her about this.     "No," one of my new friends answered.  "Rachel would be uncomfortable ..."  "That's cool.  We're going to have a fuckin' great time anyway."  I had no complaints, really; I was with my new group.  It only took two years of high school to find, slowly approach and fit myself within their circle.  Still felt like a bit of an outsider, or at least a newcomer, as they had all been together since the cradle of junior high.  But I was accepted by the close of junior year and was now one of the gang by the August before our last together.    We constructed a fire pit and dug a pee hole.  Once the sun set, Ned's break lights provided an ample source of fun, especially when we cranked up Private Dancer on repeat.  The pictures didn't actually have the desired red glow, but we wouldn't know that for another few weeks.  We each struck poses in the red light and a few naughty, memorable group shots made their way onto many a roll.  Throughout the activities, my mind was continuously caught between thoughts of the other visit to this place, the other reason hands had been washed in the creek nearby, and the fact that I'd at last found friends I could comfortably be myself with.  They didn't  know , of course, but I wasn't troubled by that just yet.  After the debacle of 9th grade, I spent most of my time in school being the smart-assed teacher's pet in class and the zombie girl in the basement who eventually fell in love with a secret.  Needless to say, it felt incredibly freeing to be able to reach out to a group of gals who reached back.  Gals to be gals with; gals who made me laugh and whom I made laugh back.  Gals to be 17 with.  Eventually, we made our way around the fire where the conversation evolved into alcohol stories.  "I've tried champagne, and MAN ..."  "Whiskey and Squirt got me sooo fucked up this one time ..."  And, as is to be expected with situations such as these: late summer evenings in the depth of youth and impossibility, we quickly set our minds to getting our lips around some contraband.  Parents' stashes, siblings, friends, cousins were all considered and quickly discarded.  We had to keep reminding ourselves of our innocent friend's sensibilities, after all.  "If you guys are going to drink, I'm going to go home."  Somehow, she managed to not make it sound quite as threatening as the words themselves suggest.  Instead, the conservative upbringing's guilt trip kicked in, and the attempt at sympathy had the reverse effect on the three main culprits.  Finally, Katy came up with the plan.  We would take a fifth of Jim Beam from her parent's basement cabinet, mix it with Squirt and "just get buzzed."  We wouldn't get trashed, of course, because Rachel's beliefs still needed to be respected.    Plus, I had a dentist appointment in the morning.  Katy, Natalie and I were ready to leap into action when we were entreated one last time by the diplomats Tricia and Kjersti:  "You guys, Rachel is really upset.  Please don't go ..."  "Fuck that!"  I was on now; this was happening.  "She's already alienating herself!"  "Yeah!" Nat joined in.  "She's already pissed, we may as well drink!"  "I know ... it's just that I don't want this to be ruined for her!"  "Well, then you two talk her into lightening up because we're going."  And so it was.  We climbed into Ned and made our way off the mountain, into town and the unknown, Savage Garden blaring though the speakers.  The co-pilots managed the music, so we got snippets of "To the Moon and Back", then "Your Little Secret" ...  "No!  This isn't it!"  ... to "The Only One" to "If I Only Wanted To" ...  "I  love  this song!  But where's that other Savage Garden song?"  "Yea!  The Chick-a-Cherry-Cola one!"  20 minutes and three scratchy throats later, we turned on to Katy's streets.  We cut the music and headlights several blocks away and parked one block away from her house.  We knew going in we would have to Army-crawl under the trailer in the driveway to access to basement-level patio door.  But faced with the 18 inch space, a part of us hesitated ... but only for a moment.  This would only make the story all the greater.  So we slithered, grunted and laughed hysterically, but quietly enough to convince ourselves we would go undetected.  Once inside, Katy immediately secured the glass monstrosity that was the object of this whole endeavor and Nat bolted for the bathroom.  "Don't flush!!"  Katy hissed in a whispered tone.  And I was left watching the spectacle, already shaking my head at our adventure I didn't want to end.    Several minutes that felt like hours later, Katy and I ushered Nat away from the tiny-so as not to be heard-stream of water coming from the sink in her concentrated effort to wash her hands and we retraced our steps and slides back to Ned, waiting in the wings.  But our adventure was only half over.  We needed mixers now.  And cups.  The closest and only source we considered was the convenience store positioned on the turn-around corner of the police force's nightly cruise route.  It was a low-risk night, being late Thursday night, early Friday morning, but our comfort level was compromised as we parked a few spots away from a cruiser.  "Don't leave me in here with the booze!" Nat wailed as we opened the doors.   "Just don't waive it around and you'll be fine!"  We admonished her.  "Besides, I have to pee!"  While Katy procured the liter bottles of our high quality mixer and red plastic cups, I tried to convince myself it wasn't completely obvious to the clerk what we were doing in Common Cents at 1 in the morning, buying such items.  But he went for it and we were not deterred.    Pulling ever-so-carefully back onto the street that would carry us to the interstate and our night of drunken debauchery, I took stock of the situation:  "Okay!  I don't have any broken head or taillights, my registration is current, we all have our seatbelts on ... right?!  And I'm going 75 all the way out there ..."  "Andrea!  You're going fucking 45!"  Indeed, in a 35 zone, next to the fire department's headquarters.  The rest of the drive back to the mountain found us at the posted speed limit, no more than, and our voices pitched at the highest level.  By the time we returned to the site, the alcohol was completely unnecessary, but any promise to stop at buzzed was left under the trailer.  We drank; we danced around the fire; the diplomats joined in and continued to console Rachel.  We three were left to our own drunken devices, as no one else seemed to want to have anything to do with us, professing our oaths of devotion and sisterhood for all time, endlessly recounting our odyssey and that fucking tiny stream of water!  We were shunned by all but the occasional crossover by Tricia, who answered our every cry of: "TRICIA!  Get over here!  We love you!  You are my best friends EVER!" and corresponding group hug.  Many trips to the pee hole were made, me on Katy's arm for drunk-leading-drunk support.  We all got caught up on Katy's sex life and were immensely relieved to learn she was at last in the habit of having orgasms.  I couldn't help but smile, thinking about how my addition to the conversation would change everything.  Instead, Katy became the self-proclaimed experienced one among the group, with Nat coming in a close second, and I looked over at the spot Ned then occupied, remembering.  We outlasted the rest of the group, finally crawling into Ned's bed, none of us allowed in the tents, as the sky began lightening with the first rays of the day.  At 7, I moved into the cab.  Around 10, as I made my way into the house, hoping the hangover wasn't as obvious as it felt, Mom caught me just as I tried to get downstairs to my bed.    "Have fun?"  She asked.  She knew.  "Oh yea ... definitely."   Don't look at her, avoid opening your mouth too much!   "Have a little to drink?"  "Ummmm..."  "Somebody bring some wine coolers?"  "Uh ... yea.  They hit me a bit harder than I thought they would, though."

      All I want to do today is huddle inside the apartment, drinking tea, listening to CDs from 1998, writing like mad.  But there's also an incredible urge to do some hard-core legal research and analysis on the Appellate Brief bear.  The cramps suck, but the emotional clarity, zen-like high they ushered in make them easier to cope with.    Think the months of morning pages are finally doing what they promised to do in May.  Clearing out years of pent-up thoughts/feelings/issues/etc., making way for new thoughts/feelings/issues, etc. in order to facilitate the creative process.    I once promised Lorraine I would write our story for the world to read; it was the kind of conversation that followed long, lazy hours in the secret apartment (aka The Nest), and the promise made with an 18 year-old's seriousness and sincerity.  It was hard-core.  But today, all I can think of is how much I want to write about the camping trip on Scout Mountain the August before senior year; the nights at the Nest; learning how to shift new-to-me Harley's gears.    Not sure now is the time of the great Telling; but it is time to start getting these stories/memories on paper.

      Think I may have over-cooked myself last night.  Woke up in a pre-menstrual haze that refused to lift until after the first class of the morning.  It was that great mix of phantom headache, teasing cramps, iffy-stomach and equal parts vulnerability/fragility and irritability/ambivalence.  Couldn't even get beyond half a morning page before having to head back to the couch to charge up for the shower challenge.  It was a worry, let me tell you!  Resigned myself to the fact that I'd have to skip yoga and spend the evening on the couch feeling hormonal.  Upon my return this afternoon, however, I found the possible source of my troubles:  the apartment was fucking hot.  I love Spring on the Palouse.  I really do.  But it's schizophrenic nature can be a bitch when it comes to adjusting the thermostat.    At any rate, this was not the mood in which I wished to chat with former (and sometimes formidably intimidating) boss Jodi about the terms of my summer employment back at the UI Library.  But the gorgeous, 50+ degree weather helped a lot, what with the fresh air, bright shining sun and skip trying desperately to return to my step and all.  She was on a break, of course, by the time I made it to the 4th floor; a 15-minute one, supposedly.  45 minutes and a thorough catch-up session with my favorite geezer, Cort, later, boss-lady and I sat down to work out the details.  I was strong.  I wasn't going to budge.  I was taking August off and she'd better not screw me too much on my return-pay.  Jodi's a bit notorious for that kind of thing, so I was expecting a haggling-session just to get to $7/hour; down $0.30 from when I left last August.    "So when do you think you'd start?"  she started, simply enough.  "Probably right after school's over; second or third week in May."  "And you're planning on working the whole time?"  "Pretty much; I'd like to take a few weeks off near the end of the summer to visit the fam and all, but that would be pretty much it."   If that's okay with you, I mean, I don't HAVE to see my family.  Just tell me; whatever you think is best.   "Okay, well, we've got this project ..."  ---Insert various project descriptions, all in friendly, cheerful, amiable nature here.----  "So really, there's enough work for you if you want the full 40 hours, or if you only want 30, that's fine too.  These aren't that pressing, they just need some regular attention."  "Well, there  is  this world-saving, humanity-enriching venture I wanted to check out after school's done, but that shouldn't take too much time."  "Okay, just let me know what happens.  And if you get another part-time gig, that's fine too.  These hours are really flexible."   WHO THE HELL ARE YOU AND WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE BITTER, CROCHETY, JEALOUS SHELL OF A WOMAN I USED TO WORK FOR!  At least I knew where I STOOD with her!   "Now, you were making $7.30 when you left, right?"  "Right."   Now it's on.  (Mentally rolling up the sleeves, sliding the lawyer-to-be facade into place.)  "Okay, well, as I told you before, the budget's been really tough lately.  They gave us a bit more money for student workers this year, but that will run out at the end of the fiscal year.  Sooo, hmmm....yea...I can probably only pay you about $8 or $8.50."  (Putting eyes back in my head and trying pass that huge gasp off as a cough)  "That's fine..."   did that sound like a squeak?!   Yea, that's right!  Try to fuck with ME, will you?!  Guess I showed  HER  who's the  real  boss!    Epilogue:  The early yoga class was spectacular, as has been an evening of homework, laundry, pleadings from a spicy number to join her for San Fransisco Pride and Thursday night TV.

      Okay, so I omitted to tell you all about yesterday's low point:  the UI administration, in all its divine wisdom, decided the University's Press is not profitable and "liquidated" it.  It's gone; no more Press at UI.  I returned to Contracts after seeing the Arg's headline furious, having to explain that, no, the paper wouldn't be effected, just the only academic press in the state that provides an invaluable service called book-publishing to the population at large.    So I decided the only thing to do would be to join my fellow lovers of books, especially those made by an award-winning Press on such non-profitable subjects as racial equality, Nez Perce history, trail/hiking guides through Lewis and Clark's trail country, not to mention the amount of material authored by faculty and grad students (Oh, and the Story of Idaho textbook published by the Press has been adopted as the standard state history textbook by the Idaho Department of Education) and write the new president-elect a little email politely asking him to reconsider this fucked up decision by our current prick of a president.    I left out the discussion on how the addition of a new swimming pool to benefit the new women's swimming team may not be an adequate trade-off for the Press' undoing.  At any rate, here's my letter:   President-elect White:  I am adding my voice to the assuredly voluminous letters/emails etc you have undoubtedly received in the wake of interim President White's announcement of the closing of the University of Idaho Press.  Much has been, and will continue to be, said about this situation, some from faculty and staff at the University and some from concerned citizens of the community.  I would like to add my perspective as a recent UI graduate and a current student at the University's College of Law, in order to help illustrate how valuable the Press is to the student body, past, present and future.  When, in the spring semester of 2002, I completed a semester-long internship program at the Press within the Editorial department the Press was able to support only  one intern per semester.  This experience and knowledge I gained from the internship was invaluable to my studies in Communication.  The opportunity to work on an in-depth, hands-on level with various stages of book publishing provided not only an increased understanding of the industry but also an expansion of my abilities as a graduate from this institution.  The rate of students enrolled in similar internships increased by 9 in the following two years, bringing the total number of interns to 11 since 2001.    This is only one aspect of the Press' rate of growth and its assured promise of  further expansions.  In addition to the internship program, the Press has facilitated a course in publishing, in which 23 students enrolled.  Furthermore, the Press supports faculty members in the English, Natural Resources, Biology, Chemistry, Entomology, History, Law, Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Physical Science, Agricultural  and Life Sciences, Anthropology and Sociology, Art and Architecture, Library, and the Center for the Center of Disabilities and Human Development Departments by publishing and/or advising them on their written works.  The Press-published Story of Idaho textbook serves as the standard state Idaho state history textbook by the Idaho  Department of Education.    In pursuing your dedication to enhancing academic experiences for students, who  ultimately subsidize these programs, I strenuously urge you to reconsider this administration's decision to do away with the state's only academic press.  These difficult decisions effect not only our current student, faculty and community populations but also  the future generations of possible alumni.    Thank you for your time and consideration.   That'll show 'em!!

      Some granola-type-hippie-liberal probably has some solar-powered bath beads coming to her as a cosmic reward equivalent to a golden toaster oven for all her conversions lately.    I suppose we could track the first of them back to last summer's conversion to the study/practice of Yoga.  Then there was the autumnal addition of tea to my regularly-ingested substances.  But things really kicked into high gear in January.  Maybe the gurus were offering additional incentives to their minions like free dredlocks for the biggest, most dramatic conversion.  Because really, the last two months have seen some major shifts:  regular lunches at the Co-op; trading AOL for Earthlink; substituting Lucky Charms/Honey Nut Cherrioes/etc. for Grape Nuts each morning; and the most recent:  the local Top 40 (read: Pop music disguised as hip hop) station's been usurped on my clock radio for NPR.  There's just something about listening to a British woman tell me about the weather in Pullman that's uniquely fulfilling.    What's next?  Substituting my usual capitalist deodorant for crystals??!

      "Those handicapped tenants must be at it again; causin' trouble, they're up to no good."  I thought as I passed three police cars parked near the said-tenant housing complex shortly after my turn onto Levick street, headed to my building after a less-than-enchanting visit to the movies.    But the two police officers walking up the stairs and into the hallway leading to my apartment made me wonder what was really going on.  Were my neighbors embroiled in a brawl?  Did I have terrorists living next door?  Was I going to see an actual police-performed eviction?  Repossession of illicit or unpaid-for property?  My excitement waned when I realized they could be headed to my apartment as easily as they could be after my neighbors.  As evidenced in the last few posts, a certain anniversary had been weighing heavily on my mind the last few days, which was the last time a police officer had visited my humble abode.  The coincidence was a tad unnerving.    So was finding two officers standing at my door when I entered the hallway.    "Can we talk to you for a second?" one said, with nary a smile or formal introduction.    "About what?"  I asked, threading myself between the two blocks of men to protect my vulnerable front (and only) door.  "Who lives here?"    "I do."  I answered, trying to remember if I'd put my bags of green vegetable matter away and locked the cage in my bathtub holding the kidnapped young heiress to a Greek fortune.  "Anyone else in there?"  Again, like we know each other.  "No; I live alone."  "Well, we received a report that crying and yelling was coming from this apartment."  "Oh thank god!  You boys really had me scared there for a minute!  That's just the ghost of an Asian maid who visits me.  She doesn't actually  live    here, see.  She doesn't like it when I see movies without her.  But when I tell her how bad this one was, she'll quiet down, I promise."  "Can we take a look inside just to make sure?"  I thought for a second about refusing; after all, I'd spent a month writing a memo in support of a motion to suppress tangible evidence acquired as a result of an illegal police entry.  But, if the ghost really had been throwing a fit loud enough for the cops to be called by a neighbor (I'm choosing to believe she didn't call them herself, which she's threatened to do on occasion), she may have also let loose the Greek heiress, who's a bit of a hassle to deal with once the gag is removed, in which case, I'd like a bit of police protection.    "Sure," I said.    They stayed in the hallway while I took the first few steps in and looks around to make sure everything was safe for human consumption.  Once I was confident the ladies hadn't betrayed me, the police asked once more: "Can we come in?"  "Oh sure!  They're...I mean, SHE's fine; doesn't seem like she's here anymore.  It's cool."  And, seeing as the situation was under control and I was clearly alone with my demons, they departed, still having never introduced themselves, the inconsiderate pricks.

      Being the follower I am, I thought I'd post something here I saw on another's blog.  Neil was asked to hit "shuffle" on this computer's jukebox (or its equivalent) and post the first 15 songs it listed.  Here's my list; those out there with blogs feel free to do the same; those without, post in the comments.  1.  Utopia - Alanis Morissette 2.  Mary - Tori 3.  Can't be With You - Cranberries 4.  She's Got the Look - Roxette 5.  Rattlesnakes - Tori 6.  Good Morning Baby - The Boy's London Mix Volume 1  7.  Green - see the above 8.  Bent - Matchbox 20 9.  Come Back Home - Pete Yorn 10.  Carbon (live) - Tori 11.   To Every Captive Soul - Hannibal Soundtrack 12.  Of Square Waves/Random Thoughts - Billy Corgan from the Stigmata Soundtrack 13.  Karma Police - Radiohead 14.  Silent All These Years - Tina Turner 15.  Do You Have a Little Time - Dido  Only 4 Tori songs in 15; her grasp is diminishing...

      The windows in my apartment are open.  When I return at the end of the day, the place will smell and feel very Spring-ish, with a hint of Summer, waking up along the edges.  And then it will snow next week, I'm sure.

      A year ago today, I was trying to reconcile my plans for the day:  breakfast with Carrie, writing the story of the Boy and I, enjoying the fresh, spring haircut, and maybe renting the newly-released QAF Season 2; with having to call the police, parents, landlord and Lorraine to tell them the news.    It was remarkably different from today thus far.  There's no snow, my hair is still long from the winter and it's a bit overcast.  I'm immersed in a new writing assignment I find myself getting more excited about by the day, and don't plan on leaving the Grind or my homework until 7.  Then I might go home and watch a couple of discs of QAF Season 2.    We love circles.  The story's published in the law school newsletter today and I've already received my first piece positive feedback.  "God loves you, hon." was the last line of the note and it reminded me of my landlord's wife's reaction to the news:  "God will get them in the end."  It may have been a different sentiment if I'd explained my theory about why the attack took place, but it was sweet, nonetheless.  So it seems the most important bits of that day and that time have stuck around:  the friends, family, car, the smile, laugh, and Queer Debbie with her brownies; while the hardest to let go of bits have managed to fade away:  the worry, anxiety, fear and suspicion.

      As much relaxed, almost-free time crosses my path every once in a while, I manage to find ways to fill up the minutes with things other than relaxing.  Lately, it's been the new internet connection.  It takes up much of my free time.  Getting everything "adjusted" and "optioned" just so, then finding out all the tinkering left out the one step needed to make it work.  But it's all really peripheral stuff.  I have a reliable, stable internet connection, and before too long, it will feel like home.  It's odd, really, how different the whole thing feels.  It's the damn internet, for crying out loud!  It's the same!  Just the access to it is different.  It's just that I remember when AOL 4.0 was high-tech.  I grew up with the ISP (tear!).  And, as necessary as the break is, a part of me does miss the kiddy-gloves AOL handles all its subscribers with.  And until the new email accounts are up and running, it might be lurking in the shadows, faintly resembling a safety net.    So today was a very easy, light day.  It's amazing what a difference a cancelled class makes.  Plus, it's Joe's 20th birthday.  Ordered the 1st season of South Park on DVD over a week ago and it was due in at any minute.    Was doing some low-back twists in the early Yoga class (done for the day in time for the 4 o'clock class!) and it hit me:  "I should get Joe a birthday cake.  He's probably not going to have anything going on tonight, anyway.  Yea, I'll get him a cake; or at least a pastry of some kind.  Then we can watch some classic South Park tonight, because really, it WILL be in the mailbox when I get home."  And so, after class, I secured a slice of German Chocolate Coconut Cheesecake from the bakery next to the Yoga center and was feeling pretty damn Laura Ingalls about it.  Sure enough, a DVD-sized package was waiting in the mailbox.  I smiled, watching the clouds turn a bright, deep pink (as deep as pink can get, I suppose) against the early evening sky.  Noticed the name on the return address listed as "Wal-Mart" and the brows furrowed a bit.  "Is that supposed to be funny?  Well, the Half.com user names could represent any company, I suppose.  It was listed as factory-sealed after all.  This will make a great blog story, at least....fucking Wal-Mart..."  Tore through the industrial-strength plastic wrap, trying to figure out why the package was upgraded to 1st class when it should have been media mail.  Saw the white packaging first, thinking they must have wrapped up the box with tissue paper; then recognized the familiar masthead:  black, bold, lower-case letters and a classy thin rainbow running along the bottom.  Queer as Folk:  The Complete Second Season.  "What the fuck?  They sent me the wrong thing!!  Not that I'm complaining, but what the fuck!"  Flashback to a conversation earlier this morning:  "Your surprise should be there any day; Levi's too."  "What did you get him?"  "A scanner."  "Shut up."  "No really, I got him a scanner."  "You did not."  "I did too!"  "He already has one!"  "He said he wanted one!"  "He says all kinds of shit!  Now what did you really send him?"  "A scanner!!"  "Okay, whatever.  Do I get one too?"  "You don't want a scanner."  "So what did I get?"  "I'm not telling."  "Is it a briefcase?"  "No."  "An espresso maker?"  "No; you can't plug it in.  It's just something you like and you said you wanted."  "Did you really get him a scanner?"  And so on.  Fade back to present:  No South Park, but Lorraine's surprise was perfect.  The first season now has a buddy on the DVD shelf and the third is being released Tuesday.  Balance is a funny thing; and it's our friend.    And by the way:  it wasn't dark at 6 tonight; it wasn't light, but it wasn't dark.  Spring is coming; and it's almost here.

      1.  I am now a proud subscriber of EarthLink.  2.  Dr. Howser's decided to submit a chapter of her personal story to the law school's newsletter; it needs to be heard.  3.  Said doctor convinced me to submit a story of my own.  4.  Brought the computer to Civil Procedure class for the first time.  5.  Major shit is going down in said class about the suit against Wal-Mart for gender discrimination and I shall now enter the fray.

      ...but the Boy makes a mean dykey vagina mix!  I'm not even all the way through it and I have to write something about it!!  The damn thing couldn't be a better finale for the day.  Classes, homework, and media board were all dealt with swiftly, deftly, without breaking a sweat, and yoga perfectly mixed challenge and ease.  I rock at tree pose, I have to say.  Found myself planning the rest of my evening in the meditative corpse pose when I should have been focusing on my breath and thought:  "I'll end up eating a burrito, reading the pleading and Rule 23 while listening to the new mix; it will be waiting when I get home."    The only addition to that picture has been the chai tea and a couple extra surprises in the envelope.    And each new song finds my jaw on the floor and a "SHUT..UUUPPPPP!!!  HE.DID.NOT.PUT.THIS.ON.HERE!!!" on my lips.  Think this might even have November beat, which makes me all the more excited for the Spring Mix.  I shudder (not unpleasantly) when I think about the inevitable Summer Mix Volume II.    Let's solve the world's problems with mixes, honey!  Forever!  On Cherry Avenue!  CHERRY AVENUE ON THE VAGINA MIX!!  LOVE IT!  And then we'll hit 'repeat' and do it all over again! 							  Author's note: this post was written Tuesday evening around 9-ish; posting was attempted around 10-ish the same evening, but AOL ... well, you can guess.  Hence, the posting this morning.  Note to author's note: AOL shall soon be no more on this system.

      I wish my Civil Procedure professor would let us know which sections of the book are superfluous  before  class.  It's a draw really; the student is either damned if she reads the meaningless material or doesn't.  He'll either skip right over it saying:  "It's good to be exposed to the historical backdrop upon which our modern system is based, so if you read the assignment for today (all 20 pages of it) consider yourself exposed.  It's not on the exam and I'm not going to spend any time on it."  Or he'll take the material line by line, asking only the most blatantly obvious questions, which are sure to confound the conservatives in the front rows.  My favorite trick of the professor, though, is his condemnation of the book's authors for including such irrelevant material and poor organization of the concepts discussed in the book, as though he has no power in how the class and the readings are organized and presented.    But, next year's students will have a better time of it because of this test-run called his first year of teaching, and that's an encouraging thought.  I suppose.  In other news, socialist hippies make great lunches and even greater atmospheres in which to enjoy said lunches.  And postal workers who refuse to send comic books via media mail because of the advertisements included therein can bite my ass.

      Glad to hear that notorious page gave my classmates as much trouble as it did me.  Who would think editing a single page after a writing assignment would be so difficult?  After all, it's what I was trained to do in my undergraduate degree, both in and out of the classroom.  For whatever reason, the universe conspired against us and many hours were spent retaliating against Page 11.  It was a difficult battle, and many casualties were suffered.  That beautiful policy pontification; the beyond-perfect quote from a spot-on case.  Ultimately, though, we were made stronger and our papers more persuasive because of those editing passes.  Or so we've convinced ourselves.  At any rate, the thing's done, finished, turned in and left to the good graces of our esteemed Professor.  And we are all a bit happier because of it.    The weekend rounded out rather nicely.  Everything on the agenda completed, including some quality time with the orphaned novels.  Plus, dear Harley received some long-overdue attention, involving open highways and loud music.  Now the week's off and running without Monday's usual easy introduction.  In addition to the usual heavy class load, this week is full of activities: the classy dame bringing the major class action suit against Wal-Mart for gender discrimination will be here tomorrow, sharing her experience and imparting her wisdom during the day and cutting it loose with students, faculty and local attorneys at the winery downtown in the evening; Natalie's competing across the way and that always leads to exciting (if not a bit frightening) places; and Joey's birthday is Thursday, so I'll have to arrange some fireworks for that.    And then it will be Friday again!  Who knew?

      Doing my part to help Neil spread the word:  A panel of five people, whose identities and guidelines have to be kept secret, who don't know they were actually on a panel, never met each other, nor knew that their views on TV would decide what was and was not suitable for the deaf to be able to watch have compiled a list of shows  urlLink acceptable  (and  urlLink unacceptable ) to continue receiving closed-captioning funding.    No more Law and Order, but all of FOX News was spared.  Seems logical.

      Actually got cracking on the writing assignment's rough draft around 1030 this morning.  YAY!!  1130-noonish is usually my start-up time, so a full hour ahead of schedule is an achievement.    Two hours later, my argument section is looking pretty spiffy and 11 pages long.  Just have to add the statement of facts and edit the whole thing down to 10 pages.  The most difficult part is over now, though.  Just have to employ those little journalistic skills:  reporting and editing.  Admittedly, this type of reporting is much more involved and entertaining because we get to tell the story from our client's perspective; we get to be as pointed, sympathetic and unforgiving as we want.  Think I'll take the Man vs The Man conflict theme to describe poor Stephen Perry's plight of being the victim of Devil Detective Danielle's vile lie about terrorists across the street when she really wanted to bust his hippie ass for pot distribution.  I'm debating whether or not to include the suspicion I have about Danielle's motives; you see, I think Stephen wooed Danielle's lesbian lover away from her and now she's exacting her revenge by overstepping her official police bounds.    Think it would start out like this:  "Danielle Washburn was a woman on the edge; a woman apart from her better judgment.  She was hurt, humiliated, humorless and looking for something or someone to hunt.  Who better than the man who ripped her very world, her reason to live and love from her and filled it with intoxicating vapor?"  Oh yea, this definitely has potential.

      Happy Valentine's Day, blogger!  It doesn't seem to count when it falls on the weekend.  Yesterday felt like the big Heart day; probably because I found myself at the mall (in the middle of the afternoon!  GASP!) surrounded by cards, decorations, sales.  I'm a fan, I have to say.  Valentine's day is our friend.  Even those of us who don't like to admit it and hide behind a veil of faux ambivalence/hostility like it just a bit.  They just don't like their aloneness; not that they should, but still.  It's just a cute little holiday that comes out of nowhere and is a nice pick-me-up in the barren void of celebrations left by Christmas and New Year's.    So yea, made it out to the mall yesterday for something other than a birthday card or a pound of coffee.  And have a terribly over-priced, retro-ugly, history-in-the-making new shirt to show for it.  Yay!  It's a terrible combination of sky/baby blue and '70s green shag carpet, sporting the stylish felt lettering announcing "Greenwich Village, NY Speech and Debate", complete with a big green bird mascot and gold star as background.  It's hideous and gorgeous in its hideousness.  It's such a Pride shirt; I can't wait to take it to Seattle this summer.  Sure, I overspent by at least $15 (and that's including the 20% off), but I already love it and am not ashamed.    Stayed out too late, but it was worth seeing Monster.  Charlize sooo has the Oscar in the bag.  I just hope she uses her power for good now.  It's a fool's hope, I realize, but we've seen what those can do for people!  And hobbits!  It didn't leave me as discombobulated as I anticipated, which was nice.  But Charlize's performance certainly has stuck around in the back of my mind, which isn't entirely all that pleasant, but what can you do?  Anyway, as a result of my latenight excursions, I was left in a less than stellar position to kick ass on the final draft of my writing assignment today.  Woke up too early to be refreshed, but too late to go back to sleep.  Felt hungover only without the alcohol and great stories.  Hated that the easy, relaxed week would have to be kicked and pummeled to loosen its grasp on my work-ethic.  So I pouted in three morning pages and felt a bit better.  Got a surprise call from the Boy and by noon, the day was looking up.    Worked for a bit on said paper, mostly shaping up what I had, inserting parenthetical suggestions like:  (Expand net line, incorporating it into "trick".)   and  (Reyes: discovered ruse; clearly the truck wasn't hurt and he was the subject of the search; the guy walked out into the street before he discovered the truth and that wasn't an intervening act)   and  (Garcia rebuttal: ruse was discovered/over before police were allowed into his house; here, she had already illegally entered by the time the ruse was discovered, tainting anything that came later; all wrapped up because she was admitted illegally)   throughout.  Hopefully they'll be helpful tomorrow when I (really, actually, honestly) go to town on it.  Made it to school around 2, typed up Friday's class notes and have been pretty successful at wasting the last hour.   Sigh.  At least my mood's been saved.  Think I'll go do the hunting/gathering routine, then do the nesting thing back at the hovel and see about maybe, just maaaybe doing a bit more paper-work before closing the day down.    Random thought: I miss Juno and Isaac.

      You want blog fodder, Ms. Mossman?  I'll  give  you blog fodder!  It's come to my attention that a certain someone seems to get nothing for her trouble in regularly reading, and now commenting on (The Platudinarian), this blog other than a miserable critique of grammar and spelling.  Most of my friends have received their own introductions here: some a bit edgy, others more touchy-feely; but she's only been mentioned in passing or in stories of funny moments in otherwise ordinary days.  Always one to jump on the remedy train, I thought I better do something about this issue, and right quick!  I mean really, here she is, taking a chance, reaching out at last, after much prodding and harassment and what does she get in return?  Well, she gets this; her very own introduction. Hope it's what she wanted.  She's the enigmatic one of our class.  Always has been.  The one everyone has a sneaking suspicion about, but few actually know.  She's just recently begun to come out from behind her shield.  And I think she's starting to like it.  I remember seeing a bit of that person around the shield the first few weeks of the school year and instantly wanting to know more.  She was so quiet and protective at school.  And, really, who can resist such a great mystery?  Once she found her comfort-level, though, she was incredibly open, honest and generous with herself.   She's the one thinking deep, profound thoughts and letting others spout off incessantly.  She's the one studying 14 hours a day and lets me get away with claiming I "carried" her through finals.  She sings along with a favorite song and wonders if she's shown too much of herself.  She begins linguistic trends in strangers' households without even trying, for Christ's sake!  She's more careful in showing off her bongo drums than in telling stories of life-changing experiences; it's easier to share who she was than who she is.  But she's starting to do just that more and more.  I hope she likes what she finds.    She used to "not engage"; now she's writing jokes in her class notes.    She's still hesitant to let anyone know how well she does or how hard she works; but she's working on finding ways to articulate those deep thoughts without too much exposure.  This is someone I hope to know forever and am grateful for each piece of herself she shares.

      Some people you look at and know instantly; others take time to see fully, but there's nothing like it when you begin to see them.    Tonight, I asked a bag of runes a not-at-all-specific question about where I am, where I'm going, who I'll meet.  It told me to start (and/or continue) letting go of my old ways, worn habits, usual modes of operation.  The Jesus-fish-looking symbol was good for a round of laughs, but the rune's description made me smile.  It was the perfect reminder and the best encouragement.    I looked at the people around me, my friends, and saw the truth and reality of its entreaty.

      A package from the parents arrived at Joe's this afternoon with Valentine's Day treats.  The usual:  cookies, money for something fun, etc.  And a new coffee maker!!!    My God!  If that's not a sign of good things to come, I don't know what is!  I can't just throw away my old one, though.  Lorraine bought it; it's my first, to go with my first apartment.  Maybe I can turn it into a planter for Trudi; or keep it in Harley; or have it mounted on my wall...

      Today's one of those days.  Haven't had one since high school, but the feeling is unmistakable and completely impossible to fully describe.    It's one of those days that begins as all others do; nothing is amiss, there's no reason to think it will be any more or less demanding than yesterday or tomorrow.  And maybe even the first couple hours aren't that special, either, but at some point, the day's activities become a mere pretense.  You're going through the motions because there's nothing else to do.  It hit me in Civil Procedure, after an hour of listening to the professor give us a book report on A Civil Action and taking bids for 2 hours' worth of legal advice.  No notes, no necessary information, no expectations.  The entire school day pretty much matched that level of involvement.  Not that I'm complaining, mind you; it's just that a day like this hasn't come along for a long while.  And to top it off, it's an unbelievably beautiful spring (that's right! SPRING!) day.  Clouds gone, sunglasses required, window optional.    So I guess it's only fitting that the day's turned out to be a bit of a collage of various thoughts/memories/feelings that haven't visited for a while.  The old high school nostalgia is going well with Melissa's latest CD, which is turning out to be quite excellent.  It matches the bright, fresh, young feeling of today.  The last, and first, Melissa album I devoured immediately upon receiving it was (yes, it's a terrible cliche) Yes, I Am.  My friend Sami lent it to me as we traveled on a field trip to Boise.  It didn't leave my vicinity for two years.  Every damn line of that album related  completely  to my place in the world, matched my life completely, as only a 17 year old in love can construe them.  Ever since, Melissa's had a special place on my CD shelf, more so than the obligatory lesbian-collection-favorites.  So it's nice to have a new album that's easy to get into and enjoy (as opposed to Breakdown or Skin; it's over Melissa!  DUMP HER!) without apology.    An anniversary has been tickling the back of my mind for a couple of weeks; and it struck me as I was perusing this month's Premiere magazine that another important anniversary has come to pass without recognition.  They work well in balance.    I'm not looking forward to Mardi Gras.  Last year, Carrie and planned a Saturday morning breakfast; I was going to return and write a wonderful story about a boy and a girl to make the Creative Nonfiction class cry.  Walked out to the parking lot to find Harley's side-view mirrors in pieces, her windshield in shards.    "It's finally happened."   Not that I'll ever know for sure, of course, whether my stickers precipitated the incident; but I'll always wonder.  It's not that huge a deal, really, and I'm not exactly sure why the anniversary has been rolling around in my mind as much as it has.  Find myself holding my breath in the morning as I make my way out, hoping.  Then feel over-dramatic and paranoid when everything's fine.    The third anniversary of a favorite weekend works well to bring the smile back.    The plans were laid more than a month in advance, during the first epic Christmas break, over the pool table.  I would have Fridays off the spring semester of 2001, and we really needed to see this movie together.  There was no other way.  A trip to Bozeman was in order.  And so it was, that said boy and girl, the weekend of the 9th saw Hannibal not once, not twice, but three times.  The first two viewings within a few hours of each other.  And we haven't been the same since.  Admittedly, the movie has lost a bit of its luster since, but the Bible we found waiting under my car hasn't.  Those few days have come to symbolize an era, of sorts.  The last moment before everything changes completely.  The deep breath before the plunge.  The pause at the end of an exhalation.  Of course, we had no idea at the time; we just knew we were young and unstoppable, together again, and summer was around the corner.    But anyway...  Today's just one of those days.

      Okay, so winter's rallying again, but its grip is still gone.  The frost fought back viciously this morning, but the coat remained unbuttoned.  Spring will find a way!  Like life!  In other news, the Idaho House of Representatives is voting in 15 minutes on whether to ban gay marriage via a constitutional amendment.  Sent emails to 6 of those reps telling them how much I'd appreciate it if they voted against it.  Not much, but maybe just enough (gasp!)  And now on to Civil Procedure reading about fee shifting and settlements.  Yay.

      Spring is coming.  It could just be my reaction to seeing the clear sky for the first time in many weeks, but there's a subtle, but distinct change in the air today.  Don't have to bundle up quite as snug; the frost was still on the windows, but mostly because it didn't have anywhere else to be, it gave up easily.  There's nothing quite like the transition between winter and spring.  Fall is great and we love it; spring into summer is a party in itself, but winter into spring is unequaled.  There's a marked change in most everything when spring is on its way; it's very sudden.  One day is decidedly winter, the next, its grip is gone.  Not just slipping or easing; it's gone, and we wait for spring to arrive.

      Alrighty...the tweaking is finished.    The links aren't quite right; I'd rather they were in the sexy little box to the right, but whatever.  All else is fabulous, and the links are still pretty damn cool, really.  And the original bloggy is still lurking around the archives (gasp!).   Had an action-packed night completely devoid of homework.  Well, except for the two pages of Civil Procedure.  Cashed in a dinner Joey owed me and we spent a nice chunk of the evening on the living room floor with our roasted chicken, macaroni salad and dinner rolls from Safeway watching The Spy Who Shagged Me.    Good times.

      No Civil Procedure done.  Instead, I thought I'd try altering the template on my blog.  I tried a brand new template.  Only to find my comments erased, along with my fancy links, and my text in a new, uncaring, unfamiliar environment.  I hated it.  So, I made my peace with the wonderful comments, lost forever, and set out to make things right by dedicating this (new) blog's life to returning things back to the way they were.  Added the links again, matched the background and text colors as best I could, and finally came to the comments.  They came right back after a few copy and pastings.  YAY!!  They weren't lost or forgotten!    Now that I know those are easily recoverable and have a better working knowledge of the color situation, I might attempt another template change one day.  But it is not this day...

      I'm vacillating between enjoying the gooey relaxing Monday the universe has given me on the heels of the lusciously empty Sunday afternoon of yesterday and being wary of the simple gratuity.    "What am I forgetting?  What huge reading assignment did I miss?  Should I review the reading I did last week that we didn't get to?"   It's always a bit weird coming back into the space that preempted a minor breakdown, too.  But I'm keeping the thought of "what shall I do when I get home?" at bay by reading for tomorrow, drawing it out by blogging and surfing the net during my lunch breaky.  I'm sure something will occur to me by the end of the school day.    But said lusciously empty afternoon was sooo great, I have to say.  Rounded out the paper by 330, leaving nothing, I repeat Nothing, to be done for the rest of the day.  To be sure, a few moments of guilt-induced "Maybe I should give that paper another look over.  Or I could read those 4 new cases I printed out to see if they have a place in it somewhere." thoughts crept up; I burrowed deeper into my over-sized pillow and tucked the new novel a bit tighter to my chest.  The book's cadence really picks up when it actually gets read for a couple hours!  Yay!    But the book I couldn't put down once I started was A Civil Action.  Decided to give it and Ghostwritten equal time, since I had it in spades, and found I couldn't get enough of the legal thriller!  It's sick, I realize.  Even had a few moments of almost-panic reading about the heroic young attorney unable to find his way: "Oh God, don't let that happen to me!" and the sharky older trial veteran training his minions: "Oh God, I can't deal with those people! Do not ask it of me!"  It was so intense.    And in completely unrelated news:     Anybody who is anybody is part of a  urlLink  photo exhibition opening this week in London.    THE London???  On the centenary of his birth, the National Portrait Gallery  WE LOVE THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY!!!  is showing nearly 200 photographs by Cecil Beaton, the gay man who for much of the 20th century was the epitome of sex and style on both sides of the Atlantic.     GO SEX AND STYLE!  GO ATLANTIC!  BOTH SIDES!

      I'm posting, not because there's anything to say, but because I don't know how long this connection will last, nor when the next reliable connection will be available.  (other than the kick ass wi-fi at school, that is.)    But I've just discovered it's not just my connection; it's AOL in general.  Hmmm.  Just when I've made up my mind to switch completely, it works wonderfully again.  Guess I'll just ride it out until it irks me for the last time.    Other than that, today's been really good.  Really relaxed, but really productive.  Have the rough draft all printed out and ready to be ravished by the red pen.  Reading for tomorrow's completed; laundry folded nicely in the drawers.  And I still have the whole afternoon to do with it what I wish!  MY GOD!  Have to send a shoutout to Carrie in Fuckin'-Boston.  She hasn't gotten much blog-attention lately, and she really deserves it.  So there you go, girlie, you're very own shoutout.  I remember my first; it stays with you forever.

      Okay, so I've been reduced to writing this in Word Perfect because AOL is gay again tonight.  It probably won't get posted until tomorrow morning when the novelty of tonight has worn away and all the great lines forgotten. (She wrote as she posted on a tenuous connection.)  Law school parties are fun.  Who knew?  I could have spent a nice, quiet, low-key evening at home with my Indian (as in the continent, not the conquered natives) take-out, laundry, yoga and new book and been perfectly content.  Instead, I risked a night out.  Three weekends in a row!  Someone get the hose!    I was sure I'd arrive at precisely the wrong time.  It was a surprise party after all, set to go off at 845.  Cruising out of the parking lot at 839, I wondered if I should circle the vicinity for a bit.  Again, I risked it, and was again rewarded.  9 came and went with nary a birthday girl to be found.  She arrived soon after, though, genuinely surprised, wearing a tiara with not a single hair out of place.  That takes skill, let me tell ya!    And there was much rejoicing.  Coups were planned, platitude-filled speeches rehearsed, hook-ups promised, shopping tips shared.  Drinking, fucking and heroine were conversation high points.  And somewhere in between the spilled beer, stories about "This guy I know" and lame Laughy-Taffy jokes, we all became a bit closer than we were in class Friday...gasp!  We will absolve ourselves of all knowledge of these activities by Monday, to be sure.  But for now, we have each other!  And it...it feels good!

      Yay for the Internet!  AOL's been acting up the last couple of days and I thought I'd have to turn my back on it forever, but oh no, the ever-so-helpful technical service staff at the corporate monster fixed it up all purty and new.  That really was the breaking point last night, being unable to sign on and surf the net, check in with my favorite bloggies.    So the day ended pretty well.  Checked out the "Human Rights store" I've been seeing flyers for and came to find out about a big peace rally protesting the local ultra-conservative-neo-confederate pastor's "History" conference at the SUB.  The guy wrote a pamphlet discussing how harmonious southern slavery was.  So, the local diversity-loving hippies planned a get together across the street in the Catholic church; they love a good fight!  Have to say, a rally against hate sounded like just the thing I was looking for, but my night was already booked with a campaign strategy meeting.  Ever the loyalist, I decided to stick to my commitment and headed home after buying some bed-wetting liberal propaganda.    As I was cleaning the apartment, which is always a good stress reliever, I couldn't escape the thought that I should be going to this rally/march instead of the Garden.  "Do these people even  know  there's a march happening?  Maybe we can catch the tail end of it after the meeting.  Student Bar Association presidential campaigns are important too, after all."  When the phone rang, I knew what the call was about and was relieved before I even answered.  No meeting.  All rally.    And it was pretty damn good.  Those Catholics know how to throw a party!  The head of the Seattle Chapter of the NAACP heralded a great calvary charge.  Then we battled the blizzardy night up to the Administration Building to listen to a journalist-turned-Southern Poverty Law Center-publication guy recount the history of neo-confederates and how their messages so closely, clearly, painstakingly match said local pastor's.  We needed our NAACP guy back.  Desperately.  Skinny white journalists don't, can't and shouldn't compete with emboldened African-American preachers.  Two hours and years of boredom later, I slunk from the auditorium.    Now that I have my precious AOL back, everything seems complete.  And tomorrow's writing assignment isn't looming as large as it has the last few days.  I'm sure there will be blood and tears running down the hands of innocents before it's all over, but for now, there's a fragile peace, one might even say...(gasp!)..balance!

      Leave it to me to have a mini-breakdown and semi-sleepless night the eve of an easy school day, promising a solid 2 hours of sleep-in time.  Nothing really new to report.  The same, obligatory overwhelming wave of realization about just what I've gotten myself into, resisting the duty to act accordingly and all the while having a sneaking suspicion I'm not doing enough.  What in the goddamn hell am I going to do with myself?  Signing up for diversity certification training in April helped a bit.  And writing the motion to suppress tangible evidence this weekend will help substantially.  Productivity is our friend.  Just trying to figure out what this bout of doubt/vulnerability is trying to teach me.  Typing notes from class is helping, too.  Can't seem to escape the fear/worry that I'm wasting time, opportunities, not applying myself fully, etc.  But at the same time, I realize that anything I'm supposed to do/find will never let me pass it by, no matter how much I may try to ignore it.  Sigh.  This seems to be my favorite struggle.

      I've resigned myself to the fact that this semester is not going to settle down.  This week has been about as normal as one could hope for, and one's still jogging a bit to keep up.  The balancing technique applied this week has been foregoing the easy reading assignments until the hours before class.  It's worked thus far, but I'm not sure it has potential for long-term success.    In spite of that little hang-up, though, things are going remarkably well.  Not sure what it is about the new year/semester, but there's a tinge of (dare I say it?) purpose? challenge? that's lurking behind every case, brief, outline, note, lecture, always prodding, whispering.  This whole experiment called law school always carried with it the question: "Can I actually pull this off?"  That question led to a few sleepless nights and more than a few frantic late night/early morning pep-talks.  And much of last semester was about answering that question once and for all.  Now that the answer is clearly "yes," it seems to be time to see how far this little experiment can go.    As cheesy as it sounds, No Doubt got it right in the line "I ask myself: 'what good do you do?'."  The answer to that has always been an adventure and a half, even without law school's input.  It feels now, though, like I have a bit more leverage in the answer; always remembering that with great power comes great responsibility, of course.    So yes, this semester is going to be a mad-crazy, wild ride, only to be followed by ever more challenging ones that make this look smooth.  But all I have to decide is what to do with the time that's given to me, which might include using fewer pop-culture references in my entries.  And it might not.

      Ever have those days when you can't get enough of a particular artist's voice?  And not just  any  particular artist's voice, but one of your all-time, all-lives favorites; one of which you hear every day, but there's just something about  this  one voice,  this day that you just can't get over?  And because you've heard this voice and six of her songs twice, everything else sounds infinitely better and the songs your computer juke-box plays are divinely selected and ordered.  Then the edges of your vision get blurry and ethereal, like a dream sequence in a soap opera, and nothing seems impossible, except sitting still and being calm.  Even Civil Procedure is interesting!!  Well, okay, it's not, but the 20 pages of reading you didn't get done last night doesn't seem quite as insurmountable.  Maybe all of this has something to do with the handstands you did last night.  Party!  Let's do some right now!  At the chalkboard!

      I just have to say how proud I am of my Boy.  Probably don't let him know that enough, so I figured this would be a good way to make up for it.  He produces artwork at a stunningly high quality level that his professors (and soon the world's masses) never fail to salivate on each due date; he gives everyone around him more than they could ever expect without thinking twice while wondering if he's done enough; he watches over the residents in his care, keeps exhausting crazy-makers at bay without causing them pain or embarrassment, works until the wee hours of the morning, creates mixes that make the world cry and STILL has time to listen to me bitch about how rough I have it.  Love you, hon; I want to be like you when I grow up.

      I don't care what that Chinese Medicine expert says!  She's a Westerner anyway!  What the hell can she possibly know about Chinese Medicine?  Oh sure, she's "licensed" and "apprenticed" with a master, but really, what kind of standards do these people use to gauge these things?  Not very high ones, I'd surmise, from their stature.  Stay away from coffee and cold food.  They'll only bring you bad things.  Whatever.  I refuse to believe every morning of my life has been detrimental to my overall health because of my ritual bowl of cereal.  Hot oatmeal is too much damn work and tea is great for evening relaxing time, but I may as well be drinking warm air for morning purposes.  Gimmie my overpriced, capitalist-pig supporting Starbucks brew, baby!  I'm avoiding typing up my Contracts notes.  Nothing too difficult, but I'm just not in the mood.  The Women's Center didn't provide the quiet haven I was hoping for.  Tried to read over there yesterday, but ended up using the same noise-avoidance tactics I use here.  I forgot how chatty women can be.  Add a few Asians-at-heart and you're totally screwed!  But I did get to show off how deliriously happy I am with law school to ex-professor Debbie, which is always good for self-empowerment.    "So you think this is what you want to do, huh?" she asked, not trying to mask her skepticism.  "Oh definitely; that took about a week to decide."    "Well, it'll be nice to have a lawyer on our side."   "That's precisely the idea."   And I know how hard that was for you to admit, my poor Debbie.     "Just don't follow Darth Vader," John, her husband, piped in quietly.  "Don't go over to the dark side."  "Never; I'm Luke Skywalker, all the way.  Or maybe Princess Leia, only without the earmuffs."     And am forever in search of my Yoda!  Tear!

      So this is the first day of the fourth week of school.  We've had 9 Contracts classes; my typed notes for the class have reached 14 pages.  We're allowed a 10 page outline for the final.    Sometimes all you (and by "you", I mean "me") can do is laugh, shake your head and start reading the next two cases for tomorrow's class.

      Skipping morning pages sucks.  I should know better by now, really.  Yesterday wasn't bad; I guess it's okay to skip them if you're hungover.  Thought it would be okay for today, too, especially since I didn't get out of bed until 11 and wanted to get school stuff taken care of to hit the 430 show downtown.  Instead, I watched TV until noon and arrived here half an hour later.    It's been 3 hours and all I've got accomplished is typing notes from Friday's classes and reading one Property case.  Not sure I even can remember what I've read.  The movie's been pushed back to 7, so now I have more time to get through at least 2 (should be 3) Contracts cases, get home, crank out a couple of late-afternoon-early-evening pages and manage to salvage the remaining hours before I sleep.    Skipping morning pages sucks.

      Seeing as how I don't have any brilliant or otherwise prose with which to describe the events of the last couple of days, I'll just list them, m'kay?    Finally eradicated the sneaky Trojan viruses from my computer, thanks to the law school's very own Computer Guy.  My search bar is back to normal and no pop-ups as far as the eye can see.  Sweeet.  Saw the cute, hot-in-a-let's-go-home-and-cuddle-way, gas station cashier at lunch with the gals yesterday.  She was with a large, burly manly man, and somehow didn't seem quite as hot.  Maybe the world looked a bit sweeter Sunday evening when I asked her for change as the fog of the Appellate Brief lifted.    And THEN!  (In the very same day!)  A fellow yoga-ite seemed especially friendly before my class last night, which follows hers.  We bonded over our mutual inability to focus on anything other than what we each have to do for the rest of the night during our deep relaxation, meditative time, she as a biology grad student, me as a brilliant law student.  "What is it with me and all these attorneys in my life?"  she asked, genuinely looking for an answer.  Apparently, a good number of her circle of friends from high school ended up being attorneys and now here I am!  Suddenly I'm "in her life"??...interesting.  And she managed to throw in that she's going to be visiting one such friend in San Francisco at the end of the month as she bore her mid-drift tying her yoga pants.  Interesting.  And there was more than one "have a good night/good luck with all your stuff!", as though she wasn't ready to leave just yet, but had no choice because I was headed to class.  Interesting.  Or all figments and exaggerations of my imagination.  Became Vice President of SODA (Sexual Orientation Diversity Alliance) today, finally fulfilling my year-long dream to be beneath Miss Q.  The fact that Dan's our Secretary/Bitch is a bonus.

      If I didn't know better, I'd think it was May.  Between the weather in the 70s, freedom begging to be played with and taken advantage of after turning in the big brief, and cute gas station cashiers giving me more than enough to day dream about, it would be easy to think we're done, finished, ready for three months of summer's glory.  But May can be a dangerous thing.  Especially when it's not yet April.  And so, I find myself somewhere in between:  nestled in the Grind, near the door, enjoying the warmth, getting ready to dig into Civil Procedure, sipping the year's first iced mocha.

      Just revised, edited, re-wrote, cut and begged my appellate brief down to 17 pages.  Only took 8 hours.  Still have to look up and possibly (better fucking not have to) add the subsequent history of my cited cases.  Plus, the table of contents and lists of cases and statutes cited should be typed up at some point.  But not tonight.  For now, I'm on the prowl for groceries and dinner.  Woo!  Look out Saturday night!  P.S.  To my fellow briefers:  is it okay that I gave bare-bones explainations of two cases under by B. section of the second issue while using way more than that for rule statements?  Your comments (answers) won't count as discussing the paper after the black-out period, I checked (while wearing a zipper).

      Just realized I can't stay at school any longer to finish the Civ Pro back-log, so I'll be taking the log home instead.  But, that means I can do a blog entry while I'm here instead.  Yay!  I must tell the story of the shelf-peg.  It's classic.    Went to my cupboard earlier in the week, at the end of a long, tiring day, for some soothing tea to find my middle shelf slumped back.  Thinking it time to flip the shelf over to counter-act the apparent warp, I unloaded the shelf and examined the pegs holding it up.  Ah-Ha!  One of said plastic pegs had given up the fight and defected to the bottom of the cupboard, leaving the peg-part of the peg nestled nicely in its hole-home.  Not in any position to devote any energy to any particular reaction, I instead replaced the board on the three remaining pegs and carefully placed light items upon it.  Tea bags here, graham crackers there.  Soup cans and microwave popcorn relocated to the upper and lower shelves.    Made to Moscow Building Supply a couple days later after a light day of class and before the 80+ pages of Civil Procedure project was to be tackled.  I was sure to bring the peg at issue along to be sure I purchased the right size.  Only when I'm faced with a myriad of plastic pegs of various sizes, no other time, do I realize the one section of the peg I need to gauge the size to be purchased is the one in the hole back home.  Still refusing to give in to any emotional reaction, I calmly pick from the range of sizes I feel pretty certain will fit.  4 of this size (because I may as well prepare for the others to give way, right?), 4 of that and 2 of the more expensive ones.  They're too big, anyway, so I'm not going to buy 4 I know I'm not going to use.  Better to get 8 that will probably work.  Sure enough, the 8 were too small.  And the two too big ones fit perfectly.  Again, not even going to worry about it.  I can take them back and recoup my $2.32.  Not a big deal.  Now I just have to set about getting this remainder-peg out of this hole.    It should be noted at this juncture that I am a very bad lesbian.  I need to go through a remedial course on basic lesbian-isms.  Just as an elementary but very illustrative example:  when my toilet clogs, I call the landlord and have them send a plumber.  Oh, I  say  I've tried plunging, but I haven't.  I think I  could  check my oil if it came to that, but I've never tested that hypothesis.  The only tool I have in my apartment is a hammer.  No nails, no screws, no screwdrivers.  Just a hammer.  So, with this background, let's proceed.  I head to the peg with the nail clipper, file at the ready.  It's small; it's thin; it's all I have that will work in this situation.  And so, I begin picking, pulling, scraping, pushing at this angle and that, to (shockingly enough) little avail.  Soon, I employ the steak knife's help, merely as a stronger force with which to bed this mere stump of plastic to my will.  Then, I realize:  the clipper might be used as a clamp-device and I can perhaps  pull   the stump out.  Indeed, such a plot would work, were it not for the sharp edges of the clipper.  It does pull the material quite a ways forward, but inevitably cuts through the weak plastic, leaving me in no better position.  After more than a few minutes of rearranging myself on the countertop and continued benign attempts at finding the right combination of leverage, pressure and pulling actions, I begin realizing I may have to explore other shelf-placement options.  Could have it a bit lower or a bit higher.  Stopped a couple of different times to seriously think about these options and always come to the same conclusion:  I want the middle.    Eventually, I stop to eat.  It's been five hours since my last meal and roughly one hour since this adventure began.  Hands are starting to shake and I'm beginning to take the whole thing personally.  The bagel and apple helped and I began round two anew.  With similar results.  Decide to call Joe to see if he has any tweezers (because I don't even have any fucking tweezers).  He has none, but suggests a corkscrew.  Why not?  Sure, it's a bit large for the area at issue, but who the hell cares at this point?  It was working at breaking the stump into a more workable slab of plastic, but the scraps of surrounding wood-work it was taking out of the cupboard panel made me nervous.  Yes, the area  around   the hole seems to be getting gradually larger, while the hole itself remains fit snugly around the peg.  The knife makes a few more appearances and the clipper is thrown down in frustration thrice, each time with the intention of never picking it up again because, really, it's time to just figure out another level for this shelf.  But as soon as I start thinking about it seriously, the more I refuse to let this fucker win.  If I have to cut it down, bit by bit, with the clipper, so be it.  If it takes all night, so be it.  And with cold, lonely resolution, I attack again.    During a typical, identical-to-all-its-predecessors, round, holding my breath to prevent the clipper from cutting all the way through the plastic (because that helps) as I pulled it forward, the stump popped out.  And few things, accomplishments, victories, etc. have felt sweeter.    I celebrated by washing the honey stains off the shelf and making completely unnecessary trips into the cupboard for the rest of the night.    Brought Sadie over for lunch today just to show her.    And now, I will run to the Building Supply store to return the unused pegs, go home and read Civil Procedure.  Happy Friday to me...and to you.

      Reluctantly admitted defeat of my goal for the evening of conquering 80+ pages of Civil Procedure catch-up reading after approximately 40-50ish.  Having one of those "Everything must get done now" weeks.  It started out seeming entirely do-able; the week's beginning, that is.  There was no pretense or easing back into the routine after the break, which was more work than break to begin with.  And suddenly, this week has completely escaped my grasp, leaving me scrambling, trying to mitigate my damages as best I can.  Have to keep reminding myself that all these tasks  will  get done.  If not in the next five hours, in the next five days at the latest.  And that's just going to have to be okay.  The fact that next week heralds the last 5 before finals begin in May is looming, albeit quietly, in the psyche, as well.  Still have two subject to outline, one of which is the Mother of All Classes: Contracts.  The typed notes for that class reached 46 pages today.  Yay.  This weekend is dedicated to the final draft of the brief; if it gets done Saturday, I'll be shocked.  I've tried giving up gauging the revision process, and the result has been over-estimating.  Between revising the rough draft and working on the front-matter (i.e. table of contents, statement of facts, etc.), it will most likely take up a good chunk of time.    So, with all of this in mind, I figured tonight would be a good time to get cracking on the material our Civil Procedure professor "covered" in our 2.5 hour class Tuesday.  I read the 6 Rules of Civil Procedure assigned, choosing to forego the corresponding cases, thinking they would be covered in painstaking detail as he has a semi-tendency to do.  Actually, I take that back, he  does  have a tendency to cover material in painstaking detail when it's completely self-explanatory.  When it's complicated, intricate, lengthy, etc., however, he skims the surface.  And thus, not only were the 6 Rules of Civil Procedure that I prepared for class covered, but so were their cases, as well as 2 more Rules and their cases.  Hence the 80+ pages of reading attempted tonight.  It was folly from the beginning, part of me knew, but another part (the same that thought we might not cover all the material Tuesday) thought it might not be too terribly monstrous.  As per this week's developments, that part was wrong.    And so, with the advice of my favorite lesbian sage (she's been on a roll this week), I stopped studying at 830; choosing instead to spend the few hours left doing the things I've been craving for many days:  yoga, blogging and, perhaps, reading about London.  Ranting about all this has helped the cause, too.  But the planner deep inside is already scoping out Friday afternoon for the rest of the make-up readings.  I just hate the feeling of being behind; and nothing is right until I'm caught up.  But I absolutely refuse to miss yoga class tomorrow night, and if it's going to make me choose, Civil Procedure will lose.    Overall, though, I'm managing to keep my "at peace with all things" outlook on life pretty much in tact.  And that's a good thing.  The Media Board, exhausting though it was, went well.  Think we chose a good group of kids to run the university's media establishment for the next year.  Some positions were sought more...intensely...than others, but, thankfully, the right person for each job clearly emerged.    I was very relieved it wasn't necessary to give a character reference to an applicant with whom I have a bit of "history."  Just the usual high school-college drama crossover, of which full-disclosure is not necessary.  But partial-disclosure is.  She decided we were arch-enemies in high school, but since we had Intro to Psych together freshman year of college, we could be friends.  Since I had nothing against her in high school and was fairly interested to see where this new "friendship" would lead, I didn't object.  Eventually, it helped bring Levi and I back into close contact and for that, I am thankful, whether she'll ever know it or not.  But, when her relationship with the Boy dissipated for the last time, I was gone from her life, as well.  And, as before, I was neither hurt nor surprised.  In fact, I took a bit of pleasure (and still do on dark nights) in the fact that he'd finally chosen the right girl.  Every time I would see her on campus while the friendship with the Boy became what it is, I couldn't help but wonder how/what her friend/relationships had become and if she had any idea what had become of the two people she banished from her life.  And so, seeing her name on the list of applicants for the university's new magazine (the yearbook's new form), a part of me smirked and a part of me sighed.  I knew already she wasn't qualified, speaking strictly of my first-hand knowledge of her professional and scholastic abilities.  She's completely capable, to be sure, she just has no motivation nor ability to commit, both of which are *major* requirements for a project of this magnitude.  But, I resolved to put this and more baggage to the side and assume the consummate-professional hat for the evening.  And, as I referenced above, I needn't have worried.  Her references, sadly but not surprisingly, spoke for themselves, and I remained blissfully silent on the matter.    As my turn approached to ask her a question from the prepared list, however, one sentence would not leave my mind.  The statement's been on the tip of my tongue for more than two years now and it needs only the slightest opening to be uttered, an opening that's never actually been given, though.  And, no doubt, she's already heard the news, but my fantasy of being the first to tell her will probably never dissipate.  And so, while she quietly answered the question before mine, I struggled to banish this vision from my mind:  "Hi Laura, I'm Andrea, Student Bar Association Representative.  I have a prepared question to ask you, but first, I just have to let you know:  Levi is gay."  And after hers and the entire Board's eyes fell out of their heads, I continue:  "That's right.  Gay.  We're gay together.  And you can't stop us.  You had him; thought he'd be the One, forever, for all times in all worlds.  But no.  He's mine.  In ways you could never understand.  And plus, Tori is ours too.  She used to be yours; thought she'd be the one, forever, for all times in all worlds.  But no ..." and so on.    But instead, I gathered my wits, wiped a guilty grin off my face, met her eye-to-eye and said:  "Hey Laura.  You know me..." watched her saccharine smile widen into one that just might have been genuine and asked my stupid question.    Maturity and growth are our friends, but slimy-mean visions can be great to cat around with sometimes.

      Haven't blogged for 3 days and I'm going through withdrawals.  It's to the point where, now that I have a tiny slice of time in which to blog, I can't form anything coherent to blog about.  The week has been a big one, already, in just two days.  We're (the Media Board) interviewing for the top positions in Student Media this evening, which is exciting, for professional as well as catty, immature, juvenile reasons (to be explained at a later date, when the results of tonight's meeting are known).  Just wish I didn't have to miss the first class of the new session of yoga.  Oh well, at least there will be pizza and carbonated beverages available.    Suppose I should get on to typing up today's class notes, as any slipping behind in such vital duties would be quite detrimental at this stage in the game, what with the semester rapidly coming to a close, outlines needing completion and professors blasting through material faster than students can read it.    Wonder if the London segment of the current novel will ever have its day.  Probably in June.

      And I'm spent.    The evening seems so easy to plan, organize, and "accomplish" when you're in hour 4 of a 9-hour drive.  The miles were zipping by and I was hefting tasks to an already sizeable list.  Other than unpacking and necessity-grocery shopping that is.  I would email this person for the first time in months, call that person, construct my new CD tower, reorganize my bookshelves, balance my checkbook, blog about the day's drive and its wonders, do a solid round of yoga and read the 2nd novel of the year (god, I hate that) until I fell comfortably and contentedly into bed.    Whatever.  Actually, the biggest tasks are complete.  The new tower is dead sexy and the books are breathing a bit easier.  The checkbook and long lost people will have to wait until tomorrow.  The only things I plan on reading is this month's Premiere and a free Rolling Stone.  And yoga might be of the deep-breathing variety.  At least I've got the blog-task on its way.  Don't ask me why I couldn't leave all this shit until tomorrow, when I have an entire day to get it all done.  Something about coming home and making a huge mess really grates; plus, it's a nice work-out, running around like mad, after spending the day in a particular seated position.    The drive felt great.  It's been a while since the roads, construction and weather have been cooperative and it makes quite a difference.  And as much as I would love to recount every milestone (no pun intended, I swear), my futon and trashy magazines are calling louder than the muse.  So, here are the highlights:  Sharing the trip's single stop with David Jack.  Seeing baby sheep.    Hitting "random" on the changer just outside of Idaho Falls and hearing the first repeat crossing the Latah county line.  Trolling, utterly in vain, the Post Falls Outlet Mall for the store in which I secured my first pair of non-matching thumb rings.    Thinking about the drive to Seattle Pride in three months.     P.S.  The Ogden trip was a success.  Found a new dead sexy outfit perfect for the wedding and indulgent weekends alone.  Plus, a few other choice gems due out this season found their way into the bags.  But, as Mom and I made our way through the Ogden Mall in less than short order, we realized:  Ogden is dumb.  We should just go to Salt Lake.  It's now my responsibility to remind Mom of this fact next time we venture to our neighbor to the south.  For this time, though, we made do with Layton, another SLC suburb; it has a mall of its own (all 40 minutes of it) and a Sam's Club, just to illustrate how far we went to find things in our backyard.  But my new clothes are worth it.

      Big sigh that lasts several minutes.  There.  Now my break can enter its "Nothing left to do but be a lazy sod" phase.  And it's only Friday at 6!  Finished the rough draft today in just under 6 hours and am feeling pretty damn sweet about it.  Not really thinking about the fact that it's 18 pages without the statement of facts or statement of proceedings and without a case my professor told me to use.  I'll worry about that next weekend after we've received insightful feedback and constructive criticism on our efforts thus far.  Then, and only then, will I set about making the final draft comport with the 16 page limit.  For now, my efforts have come to an end, just in time for one last day of Break before heading back north Saturday.    So, Mom and I are heading to Ogden bright and early tomorrow to shop our asses off, which should make for a great send-off.  I'm always surprised to find myself surprised when she has a bag of clothes waiting for me when I arrive.  But sure enough, she's been finding unbelievable bargains ever since I left the last time and has piled them in my room.  And tomorrow, we'll be searching (and no doubt finding) even more.  Chief among our duties is finding a nice summer frock for my (only cool) cousin's wedding in mid-June.  She wouldn't care if I showed up in leather pants, but for once, I'm ready to find a nice, summer-y, not-too-formal-yet-not-too-casual "something."  I have no idea what that means, but I'm convinced I'll know it when I see it.  And if it has to be a tiny tissue of a dress, so be it.    But enough about tomorrow and the days to follow; I realize it's been more than a few days since my last post and this fact pains me.  It burrnsss usss!  Okay, not quite, but I do miss my little bloggy.  When last we blogged, the Boy and I had just finished enjoying our first day off in two months.  That evening found us enjoying chips, salsa and screaming monkeys with his hot-yet-empowered pal Bridget and her hot-in-a-cute way fiancee Dave.  We decided against the fried ice cream and opted for Dairy Queen Blizzards in the back of Bridget's Honda.  It was so hot.  The next day, we set out to get work done.  The more we sat around that morning and talked about other issues, the more we thought our work wouldn't really take  that  long.  After all, I was just outlining my Civil Procedure notes, and between the  Erie  doctrine and Rule 12, what more is there?  Well, as it turns out, about 6 hours' worth, give or take a back-cracking stretch and whine for a Coke.  But, as the last of the rays descended along the horizons and the first stars made their appearance, we threw ourselves on the couch, triumphant in our accomplishments.    "Wanna go get a Coke?"  the Boy asked while flipping through Neil's latest comics.  "Yea."  I answered, not lifting my head from its den in his couch's cushions.  "Let's get some ice cream, too, and make floats while we watch more Queer as Folk."  And so it was.  We stayed up way passed our bedtimes, squealing at Brian's sweet dead sexiness, Ben's Superman physique and Clark Kent demeanor, and Emmett's fabulousness.  Then there was the preparation of Luscious Lorraine's Super Spring package.  It was painstaking and caused more than a few tears, but it was worth it....squeak!...it.was.worth.it.   Yea, all in all, the Break's been a pretty good one, and the incredible swiftness of time's passing hasn't had quite the impact I thought it would.  Maybe that's because being home feels different than it did during the undergrad breaks.  Christmas break certainly felt different than any of its predecessors, to the point that it didn't feel like a break at all.  Near the end, I had to remind myself that I would soon be returning to school, that it was time to start thinking about going back.  "Back?  Back to  what ?  Aren't I finished?  Isn't this the way things  are  now?"  It was the most difficult return back to Moscow, too.  So perhaps I've discovered how to fully enjoy being home and all that entails (even with piles of work to do) to the point where the time doesn't evaporate before I even have a chance to acknowledge the fact that I'm  on  break.  Whatever it is, it feels really great.  And as much as I'm loving Spring, Summer can't get here fast enough.

      Okay, soo much better now that we're on the good ol' Earthlink dial-up connection.  Just got back from a good day bee-bopping around sunny, yet still chilled, Bozeman.  Spent some money we didn't have and added 3 new books to the pile of "Love that I have it, but will probably never read it" finds.  There's just something about new books.  Don't know what it is, but they're fucking dead sexy.  And there's just something about sitting in a coffee shop mauling the new purchases all over, coming home and rubbing them in hot love juices that seals the deal.  Then, years and many memories later, when they're pulled off the shelf, they get to be new all over again!    I honestly have no business bringing home new books at this point.  I've been reading the same novel for 2 months and have barely cracked the 200 page mark.  Plus, I'm running out of room for them.  I would be more justified bringing home abandoned baby kittens.  But for now, they're the newest, coolest books ever and there was much rejoicing.   Just chilling back at the pad for a bit before hitting the night life with the much-talked-about Bridget and her steady beau Dave.  Then we're back on the Boy's agenda:  movies, magazines and sex.  I would rather curl up with the new bookies, Civil Procedure and tea from Goldie, but I mean, whatever the Boy wants he gets.

And I'll try to hook my machine up to the Net soon so as to post a good post.  Until then....

      Left the scarf at home this morning.  It's always a little sad when it happens, it's such a great little scarf and all.  And we seem to always have an obsession with our *firsts*, especially of the epic variety.    The sexy maroon number with the grey stripe on one end is certainly of that variety.  Leave it to me to travel many thousands of miles to buy my first item of truly British clothing at the Gap.  Not just any Gap, mind you, the one in the commercial heart of our dear old Great Grandmother.  No quaint old store on hidden backstreets shopping for us!  We couldn't even get away from huge commercial coffee shops for god's sake!  Regardless of its heritage (and maybe a bit because of it!), the scarf became an integral part of the rest of the London voyage and has remained such ever since.  I don't put it way during the warmer months.  It stays faithfully at the ready, even though it never gets used once the windows start staying open (which they are).    So yea, today marks the end of the little guy's reign for this year.  To be sure, he'll come with me for Spring Break because winter's still fighting like hell everywhere else in the state, but his duties are winding down.  I miss him when he's not around.  But driving to school with the window rolled down and squinting though the sun glasses work well to remind me exactly why he was left to his own devices.    Anyway...  Have a pretty light day today.  So, of course, I'm going to fill it up with important duties.  Well, just one, really.  Going to write the first issue of the Appellate Brief this afternoon, after the big Candidate's Forum.  GO SUE AND ALYCIA!  Will have a nice, solid 5 hours to crank that sucker out, making it the most beautiful rough draft of an argument I've ever seen!  It really shouldn't take that long to write it out, but I'm determined to use the time allotted to the fullest, so if I can make a editorial pass or two, that's just fine by me.  Getting the Motion to Suppress assignment back yesterday provided the perfect motivation, too.  We love rolls, and seeing just how far we can push them.    Friday's rapidly approaching and the Mixes are anxious to hit the highway.

      Can't think of a more fitting end to a 10-hour day, sure to be the first of more than a few others to follow, than a nice Intro-Level Yoga class and the purely idealistic thought that I might actually do more work upon my return.

      The weekend was a success.  Productivity all over the damn place.  The brief's outline is 8 pages and looking good.  Property outline is twice that long and even prettier.  And as I was printing out said brief outline last night, I realized it's not actually due until tomorrow.  For a moment, I was crushed.  But then I realized that I would not have gotten as much done during those two days had I allowed the extra day of work today.  So, as a result, I'm ready to tackle this week on all fronts and chip away from the Break's work-load as much as possible.  Have the last 6 cases to read for the brief assignment all ready and waiting to be highlighted and possibly incorporated into the outline.  Oh yea.  So smooth.    And to top it all off, we're supposed to edge toward the 60s today.  Degrees, that is, not the decade; but that would kick ass, too.    And can I just say how much I love the   urlLink mayor of Seattle?

      Happy Sunday, blogger!  You get to be the morning pages today, m'kay?  M'kay!  So the outline is done.  And I have to keep reminding myself of that.  The weekend's biggest assignment is finished, just needs to be printed off and that will be that.  Have all day to outline Property, which *shouldn't* take the whole day, like yesterday's little ditty.  The best part about being so busy with so many different things right before a break is discovering six new things waiting behind each task completed.  Because really, it's all about mitigating the damage done to Spring Break.  Sure, next week's assignment is done, but if I can do  more , say, have the first issue for the rough draft written before Friday, that means I'll only have to sacrifice one day out of the four I'll be home to work on the second issue.  So really, even though the productivity is high and the hours long (for a weekend), there nevertheless remains a huge pile of work to be done.    Sigh.  At least my blood's finally replenished itself.  And really, I'm loving every second of the whole damn thing.  Even had my ritualistic Sunday-morning-coffee-web-surfing with the Vagina Mix...kick ass.

      That's me.    And now I have the book to prove it.  Our esteemed Torts professor (looking every bit the 2nd grade school teacher this morning) raffled off the heartwarming story of the courageous teenage boy, who, after being gravely injured while using a farm machine, takes on its powerful manufacturer and wins, to the class members who donated blood yesterday.  "What if you tried, but the flow stopped?"  I asked from the pews.  "Wellll..."  she waffled.    "I have the bruise to prove it!  I have a physical impact!"  I argued effectively, using her own concepts against her.  "Oh, if you have a bruise, you're in!"  "Damn right I am!"  And wouldn't you know it, the one person in the pool who didn't  actually  give blood walked away with the prize.    Balance is our friend, especially when it's slanted substantially in your favor.

      It is quickly becoming apparent that there is no time to spare.  Sure, the Appellate Brief has loomed large since its distribution, and last weekend's surprise attack of the Issue Statement brought the scope of the assignment into sharper focus.  This week, though, has brought with it not only the confirmation of that realization, but also the knowing that preparations for finals will soon be in full swing.  Yes, only half-way through the semester and it's time to start preparing for finals.  So that whole: "If I'm not working on homework, the paper or outlining at each moment of the day (until about 8 or 9--I still demand an hour or two to myself), something's wrong" thing has arrived a good month early.    But we got a bit of a break today with the canceling of Contracts this morning.  And instead of using the hour to read for tomorrow or more cases for the Brief, I moved tables for the blood drive, wrote notes on chalkboards (my first official duties as the new Women's Law Caucus Treasurer) and am now blogging.  Fine.  So I'll have an extra hour to myself today.  Sue me.

      Alright, as promised, here's the hot action, as it unfolded, from Sunday:  Billy Crystal needs to stop.  Give me Steve Martin or Whoopi any year.    Supporting Actor, Tim Robbins: well- and long-deserved.  Maybe a nice concession for Mystic River.  Art Direction, LOTR:  good damn start!  Animated Feature, Finding Nemo:  Oooh!  Woo!!  Pick me!  Costume Design, LOTR: YAY!  Better not be a damn concession.  There were costumes in that movie?  Supporting Actress, Renee:  Yay!  Good actress, good role, good win; could her speech have been more rehearsed?  Joe:  "You're writing all this down?  Next thing you know, you'll be keeping a journal!"  Fran Walsh, you ARE the lion, the witch AND the wardrobe!  We love you Bob Hope!  Live Action Short, Two Soldiers:  And what a pair they were!  Animated Short, Harvey (something I didn't get):  Love you Harvey!  And love your hot creator thanking his hot boyfriend.  Visual Effects, LOTR:  Damn right.  Make Up, LOTR:  They better not be setting us up.  There was make-up in that movie?  Sound Mixing, LOTR:  Okay, this is looking really good; better follow through, Academy  Sound Editing, Master and Commander:  Is there a difference between Sound Mixing and Editing?  GO JULIA!  We love you Julia!  And your wispy, gaspy "yeah"s following a legend's legendary line.  And who came up with these lost dog Master Card commercials?  They're good shit!  We love you Oprah!  And your eye-shadow that matches your big bow-y dress.  Documentary short, (some mini-epic about the results of radiation exposure):  The housewife-director looked thrilled.  Stupid radiation, anyway.  Documentary feature, Fog of War:  It's the worst fog of them all!  Original Score, LOTR (Howard Shore):  We love you, Howard Shore!  Make love to us, Howard Shore!  Film Editing, LOTR:  Okay, really, this had better not be a damn ruse!  Original Song, Into the West:  Joe gets the line for this one:  "Here comes the rain again."  Foreign Language Film, The Barbarian Invasions:  Canadians know (and do) them best.  Cinematography, Master and Commander:  It's a good thing there wasn't any cinematography in LOTR  Adapted Screenplay, LOTR:  It's so in the bag.  Original Screenplay, Sophia Coppola:  KICK ASS!  But you're not going to be the first American Woman Best Director tonight, sorry.  Hope this makes up for it.  Director, Peter Jackson:  GO PETE!!  Waddle your way up there!  Don't stop to comb your hair!  WHAT? NO OVATION?  Go Bill and Joan, good job.  Actress, Charlize Theron:  Yay.  Now go do something with it.  Actor, Sean Penn:  HE gets Peter's ovation?  What the fuck?!  We DO love you, Bill!  Go Hollywood Foreign Press.  Picture, LOTR:  It made a clean sweep; it's in the company of Titanic and Ben-Hur for most-won awards in a night and STILL no ovation.  Good thing we're not bitter.

      This didn't really have a place in my last post, so it gets one of its very own.  I WILL post my blow-by-blow accounting of the Oscars soon, maybe even tonight.    But I've amassed an interesting collection of quotes from the day (just today) that must be posted without any context whatsoever to set them up.  This is why I write down funny random quotes, my friends, because they always pay off later:  "What is a cow?"  "Good."  "Then we'll have the plaintiffs testifying about how they didn't do anything to get cancer; the Moms thought they were protecting their unborn children.  It's time to bring out the violins."  "It was one of those 'see 12 countries in 2 days' kind of things."  "If we were all the same, without any differences in views or opinions, we would all be Russian."  "Yoga can help that, you know."  "Can it make my boobs stop growing?"

      Few things are less tiresome than typing up notes from class, but few things beat the feeling of utter completion and triumph after typing up notes from many days of many classes.  It is true, I have not recorded my notes from today's Civil Procedure class, but they're all nicely kept in the Federal Rules supplement section called RULE 12.  No, our professor could not just assign us it to read, he had to tell us in class what each section and subsection said.  (Sigh)  The book reports have reached a new level.    Anyway, my note-typing has been a bit lax of late, as I've been distracted by the whether, my fabulous mood in general and yesterday, by this incessant need to run errands.  The two primary points of focus were getting my winter locks trimmed and buying a small, relatively-inexpensive boombox on which to play my bastardly-burned CDs.  And so, rather than staying around, studying and typing after classes, I took off immediately thereafter to seek my fortune with a stylish new do and miniature stereo.  It all went fantastically, I successfully avoided the evil one-stop shopping empire taking advantage of minimum-wage working women across the land, the Spring Mixes providing the more-than-apt theme songs.  In fact, I even managed to investigate the possibility of a new bookshelf/DVD tower and do a bit of grocery shopping AND fill Harley's tank before heading home by 3!  I KNOW!!  Amazing, isn't it?    And it didn't stop there!  Once home, armed with my new toy, I set about enjoying it immediately while catching up on checkbook balancing and general house puttering.  Eventually, all the good times had to come to an end for the sake of doing today's homework, which wasn't even needed as it turns out.  As I was preparing dinner before heading back to school to type up my back log of notes (yes, class, this is foreshadowing), I felt ready to experience the 1st Volume of the Spring Mix on "Random" mode.  I looked for a convenient "Program" button or the like on the handy remote the boombox came equipped with, but was denied.    "How odd to only have the random feature on the player itself." I thought as I made my way over to the little guy on the floor, pushing away the thought you all are having now.  Crouching around the new acquisition, I denied the obvious even further.  "Here, let me turn on the light.  It's got to be on here somewhere."  But it wasn't.  "Maybe I need to do a combination of 'Program' and 'Memory'."  But I didn't.  "Okay!  FINE!  So there's no Random feature.  So what?  I can live with it like it is!"  But I couldn't.    "Hey!  I'm NOT going to Wal-Mart after all that!  Principles are worth more than a damn Random feature!"  But they're not.  I tried convincing myself of that throughout dinner and the first subject's notes, but I knew the truth.  And so, Contracts was forsaken for yet another day and I made may way back across the border to return my briefly-but-intensely-enjoyed-but-ultimately-worthless new boombox in exchange for one from the Den of Satan.  And no, Shopko did not offer any viable choices other than the one I initially walked out with, so don't even start with me!  I loved my new RCA pal immediately, even though I felt kinda dirty about it.  To make sure I would never forget what was forsaken in the path to Random, I named the little guy Sam, after the founder of Wal-Mart.  He is now Sam Tort in further recognition of the trials those brave workers face each and every day so I can have everyday low prices and my Random feature too.

      It is 5:13 and I am done.   With reading for tomorrow.  With outlines.  With studying.    I have less than 2 hours before yoga and then the rest of the evening is mine to do with whatever I will.    How odd.    So I thought it would be fun to compare the length of my outlines this semester to last.  It's pathetic and gross, I realize, but looking at my Property outline from Fall semester made me laugh out loud, so naturally, I had to find out how comical all the others were, too.    Property:  Fall = 7 pages.  Spring = 28 pages.  Contracts:  Fall = 12.  Spring = 34.  Civil Procedure:  Fall = 11.  Spring = 30.  Torts:  Fall = 11.  Spring = 26.     Criminal Law:  Fall = we didn't have this class last semester, but I couldn't leave it out of the fun.  Spring = 24.    I'm taking the new numbers as a good sign.  And now I'm going home to enjoy the rest of my evening entirely void of any duties or responsibilities.

      Especially when they're tied or in the process of being tied.    Don't remember having an afternoon of solid work with corresponding finalities attached to every task.  It feels really fucking great.  Just finished the two major outlines for the two major exams next week.  Only in Contracts can two weeks of class add 15 pages to an outline.  But it is complete at last, coming in at just under 45 pages.  I'll think about hacking it down to 10 sometime this weekend.    Now on a little break before I dig in with the last bits of Criminal Law, Torts and Civil Procedure (which is mostly editing Miss Q's notes from the last two classes--no wonder it takes her a solid 2 months to outline, everything anyone could possibly know is included in those suckers!  Twice!).    Feeling soooo much better about everything as the week goes by.  A big part of it is studying with the gang.  Who knew study groups could be so helpful?  No more of this island-mentality for me, that's for damn sure!  Well, at least in respect to studying for finals.  I can be an island the rest of the day.  Classes winding down feels nice too.  It's been a while since I've been  excited   about the end of the year arriving.  Last May was spent in denial about Graduation and going through too many goodbyes to be very much fun.    And there's so much to look forward to this summer.    The weekend in Bozeman right after the last exam: nothing but celebration and investigating new possibilities.  Return to the Library:  I'm famous there and they're paying me more than ever.  Cool Cousin's Wedding:  Getting some nice family time, full of congratulatory pats on the head and hanging out with the newly-weds at a hip-happenin' piano bar after the big shin-dig.  Hopefully the parents will retire to the hotel early.    Pride in Seattle:  missed it last year and this one is sure to be the best yet.  Ever.    And all that's only in the first month!!!    But first, there are two weeks to triumph over, and I shall return to preparing for the battle ahead (which has magically transformed into something less ominous, oddly enough).

      ...that happened yesterday.    Because our choices were limited and no one else showed any interest, I was appointed  Interim   Chair of the Media Board.  Sigh.  We'll see how many times I'm going to have to give it away before it stays away or sticks around.     And on a completely unrelated note:  Does anybody want or know somebody who wants a uterus?  I'm taking bids.

      Things that happened today (and by today, I mean within the last few days):  I reminded myself that my goal is not As; my goal is to do my best.  The Boy met a nice guy who loves Allison Janney.  And that's a good thing.    Sadie laughed until she snorted while reading Contracts flashcards.    I've convinced myself that I will do well this semester.  (Props to the Oracle for the affirmation)  Karen reached between my legs.    Sadie got caught checking a girl out.    The Grind became not only the cool place I hang out on lazy weekends and flexible work afternoons, but also the cool place I study for finals in with my peeps.

      Now that the Sami Omar al-Hussayen trial has come around, the publicity is back; this time, we're getting attention from the New York Times:    urlLink It is one of the few times anyone has been prosecuted under language in the antiterrorism law known as the USA Patriot Act, which makes it a crime to provide "expert guidance or assistance" to groups deemed terrorist.

      As with the viewing of Vol I, I have nothing to say about Vol II that hasn't already been beautifully summarized by the Boy.  And so....   Needless to say I was all erect    (well, you know what I mean)  about Vol.II and I went to see it last night... Closure kicks ass! This chapter is just as phenomenal as the first, but in a totally different way. Where you got all the great action and set-up in Vol I, this time you get all the depth and back-story, as well as the satisfying and totally suprpising resolution. The genius of these films is that you KNOW where the story is going, but the methods of getting there are totally suprising and over-the-top in the very best ways. When you expect the epic, you get the intimate; when you think intimate, you get the most epic. Not to mention it's fucking gorgeous! Not only does Q have a great mind for dialogue, but he's got a bitchin' eye. (and uses them in unexpected ways).  The two volumes together are stunning, that's all there is to it. I'm such a slobbering fan, but it's the truth. A beautifully rip-roaring good time, and as much as we might want to see more of Uma and her bad-ass Bride, it's probably good that the story ends where it does. It couldn't possibly get any better than it already is.   So yes, such a great way to celebrate the end of another Crazy 88 week and kick off another weekend full of preparing for finals.  And if you let me know when you're planning on making your way to Pullman, esteemed Q fan and illustrious, wise professor in all things alternative, I just might join you.  We're down to the last week of classes and the obligatory doubts and worries are working their way in.  But they'll listen to reason and a few hokey self-affirmations.  The growing leaves on the tree outside my window and spotless sky help, too.  Once the day really warms up, think I might make it to campus and work on Torts while I work on my tan.  It needs the attention, let me tell ya.  Here I've been so diligently crafting various muscle groups (at first because they really needed some action and eventually because summer was on its way and I needed to get myself ready to display), and the skin coating said muscles is still pastey-assed white.  We can't have that.    It's sick but there's a part of me who can't wait to tackle this semester's exams; to see how the attempt to push myself further worked out; to celebrate the victory of making it through the first year in a manner fit for fairy tales.  And there's another part of me who can't wait to be a librarian.

      The powers that be really choose the wrong time to have first year law students plan the rest of their law school careers.  Two weeks before finals is just not the time to do it.  We're too stressed; we're too worried; we're already questioning our very existence and now they want us to decide how well we're going to do under  more  pressure and  more  stress.    Had a "I wish the ring had never come to me" night last night.  They're getting easier to overcome, I must say, but they still visit every once in a while.  And it's never a fun time.  The old "what should I be doing this summer?", "do I have any right to be Chair of the Media Board with my schedule?", "do I REALLY have to do moot court?", "did I make the right choice coming to law school?", "when am I going to study for finals?" questions had a party as I tried to get to sleep after avoiding the bed until after 11.    But this morning, most of them had gone.  Much of this has to do with end of the semester stuff.  And really, this round is sooo much better than the last.  At least I  know  what I'm preparing for this time and that helps a tremendous lot.  The doubts manage to creep in, however, when I look over at other's outlines many times the size of my own or when we get emails from the Oracle telling us we should be doing 2-3 practice answers  A DAY  in preparation for the big exams.    So yea, this atmosphere is not the best for figuring out the next four semesters.  But chatting with professors helps.  And finally making decisions I resisted for a few months does well to take the edge off, too.  The schedule that yesterday looked to be a punishment for stupid, idealistic, oblivious hobbits who have no idea just what they've gotten themselves involved with, today looks entirely do-able, challenging in empowering ways and maybe even a bit interesting and fun too.    I'm still taking the summer off; but had to finally let the Student Media Board go.  It was hard, but Dan held me afterward; and I immediately felt better, having decided.  Only a few hours later, another option appeared for next summer, which will make for more flexibility during my last semester.  Will still run by the new schematic by the Dean tomorrow, but at least I'll sleep easier tonight.

      My reward to myself for completing the Criminal Law outline, replacing the unfortunate-coffee-fence-jumping-incident-victim  Property Study Guide and cleaning my apartment over the weekend was renting Kill Bill, Volume I. Its meaning and effect on my life can best be described by the Boy from his blog over the weekend:   Never been much of a Tarantino fan. I always found him as obnoxious as he was pretentious, and he didn't earn any points by casting himself as the obnoxious asshole in all his movies. I hated "Reservoir Dogs" and I thought "Pulp Fiction" was cute for its novelty, but otherwise empty and overblown...except for Uma, who only got 1/2 hour. After she leaves, the movie is dead to me. I didn't even bother to see "Jackie Brown."  (note:  I actually haven't seen Reservoir Dogs, but his was too great a tangent to edit.)   So I scoffed at the hype over 'Kill Bill' and swore I would hate it if I ever wasted enough time to watch it. I saw it as poor, washed-up-Quentin's attempt to cash in on the post-Matrix Kung Fu revival which is so sad it's not even funny...and what's with this Charlie's Angel's rip-off anyway?  (This paragraph I agree with completely)   Well this snobby, elitist Pig was more than happy to be proven wrong.   (respectful snipping)   It didn't take ten minutes for all my venemous hate to become drooling awe. (That doesn't happen often, I assure you.) I was totally blown away by everything about it: the dialogue, the characters (and their names!), the action, the editing, the shameless 70's film referrences, the fucking music! Just dead-serious enough to care about the characters, with enough winking parody to offset its own cartoony violence. Even the damn credits were brilliant! And Uma as The Bride! Uuummmmmaaaaa!!! It's the movie she's needed since Pulp Fiction, and thank god Quentin finally gave her one. (without John Travola!) I was very pleased to learn that Q & U developed the character together way back on that OTHER movie. No wonder she embodies it so well...   (YAY!!!  ME TOOO!)   Anyway, I felt like a whole new fag  (dyke)!  I could not believe how wrong I was, and how much I loved being wrong. How often can you say that you love...LOVE Daryl Hannah and actually mean it? I was a giddy, bouncing fan-boy and not a bit ashamed   After having the same experience, I called him up and we gasped and giggled like little school girls over that scene, this look, ALL THE LINES!!!  It made going to bed after midnight worth it, and when I slept through the alarm again this morning, the omission of morning pages didn't hurt quite as much when I thought of the red cross in Daryl's eye patch.

      Today is my anniversary; or, I guess it  would  be.    Didn't notice it until checking my watch in Contracts class and saw that it's the 16th.  The rest of the class was spent reliving snipets from the day six years ago.  It was a Friday (last year was leap year, remember), and things were slow in Government class.  We must have had an exam or some like thing because I'd brought my current book with me to fill the remaining 40 minutes.  The author had included his wedding ceremony in the text and I was struck by how similar the sentiments and promises described in the passage resembled feelings, thoughts and conversations Lorraine and I had on a regular basis.    We'd done the play "Will you marry me?" thing quite a bit.  Mostly in the context of playful, relaxed, lazy evenings or afternoons basking in the few hours we had together that seemed to stretch on for days.  But reading these exchanges this day suddenly made me want to do it for real, if only in our own minds.  And so, I left class knowing I would ask the woman I loved to marry me that evening.    It was a pretty informal affair.  None of our friends were in attendance, and we never received any gifts.  I even, quite by accident, called her by her ex's name at one point, reading the name out of the text (what are the odds that the author's wife's name had same name as her ex?!)  But it was sweet and we celebrated it every year, in whatever capacity we could.    Without realizing it, we had a perfect celebration last night.  I returned home from a full day of brilliant law school activities around 9, and pushed on for another half an hour before finally admitting defeat.  Scraped a picnic dinner together in front of the TV, at last free to relax and enjoy the remnants of Thursday night TV.  When the phone rang, I whined and refused to get up unless it was someone letting me know I'd just won a free puppy or something.  Pretty close.  It was that girl, calling to say a quick goodnight before her Sleep-Be-Here kicked in.  It was pretty perfect, really, and the fact that neither of us knew what date it was probably contributed.  Had good laughs like we used to, and told idiosyncratic stories that illustrate more about who we are as people than long, involved, deep conversations; there's just nothing like coming home completely ragged to an unexpected connection with someone who knows you completely.    Happy Anniversary, my Mrs. Jesus.

      I've never really mastered the art of waking up to Morning Edition.  Maybe it's the Brit's soothing voice; maybe it's the lack of annoying commercials that refuse to shut up; maybe I'm just conditioned to FM radio.  Whatever the explanation, I've consistently been sleeping through the insightful, probing news stories and these have been increasing in length and significance.  At first, it was just a few minutes out of my breakfast-TV time; then, it was hurrying through Morning Pages a bit; this morning, I managed to get myself on Tuesday's clock.  Tuesday-time is half an hour later than Wednesday-time.    I thought I was only 11 minutes behind when I rolled out of bed at 7:11.  And when I got in the shower at 7:37, I was seemingly right on time.  True, there was something a bit off all morning.  Just seemed to not be entirely on top of things, or at least not as much as I would like...but I attributed it to the mocha I had after 5 last night and my less than filling dinner of leftovers.  Nothing a good dose of water and vitamins wouldn't fix.  But, when I finally glanced at my watch before heading out the door, I was slammed back into Wednesday-time: 8:06.  Class began at 8.  Yay.    During the drive to school, I considered not going to class at all.  But I didn't spend more than a good chunk of my early and late evening reading 20+ pages of material just to not have the lecture to go along with it.  And so, I went into class, 20 minutes late, head held low and avoiding eye contact.    But I needn't have worried:  they had done student evaluations during the first 20 minutes of class and the rest of the time was spent discussing the functions and form of the Statute of Frauds, and not the material I read so diligently last night.  So basically, I got to sleep in, albeit unknowingly, took notes that don't need to be typed up and have no reading for Property to do over the weekend.  Student evaluations rock.

      I'm already mourning the loss of Miss Q's presence over the summer.  She'll be in DC, playing breadwinner to Alycia's Super-Law Student-Intern for an illustrious international ambassador; and together, they'll probably make the world a little bit better for their efforts.  Meanwhile, the rest of us back in Moscow will be missing out on the promised barbecues and hot tub parties.    Plus, I'll be missing out on conversations like this:  "Hey Miss President, how was your weekend?"  "Did you bring me a cookie?"  "What kind of a relationship to you think we have?"  "Will you carry my books for me?"  "What am I to you?"  "A gap-filler."  "Here, I'll walk behind you, since I'm just the Vice President."  "Two paces, at least."

      Not much to blog, really.  Pretty full day of being crouched over various books, struggling to keep the eyes open during the laborious discussions of expectation damages and encouragements to breach for Contracts and the difference between some courts' requirements for an overt act in characterizing the offense of attempt for Criminal Law.  A nap helped.  The two Torts assignments put me behind a bit, but I trudged back to school around 8 to prepare for Civil Procedure.    Coming home to a request to have a copy of my Motion to Suppress Tangible Evidence ready for the Advanced Research and Writing professor added a nice finish.    Now just surfing nearly-forgotten web sites and checking email at a leisurely pace; never would have considered these activities of luxury, but they feel pretty indulgent tonight.

      There's just something about bringing 58 pages of typed class notes to their knees in a 33-page outline that puts a gal's spring back in her step and makes the world a better place, if only for an evening.  Finishing tomorrow's reading, grocery shopping, and two loads of laundry helps too.    Suddenly three weeks seems like just enough time to get the semester's tasks finished without complete and total burnout.  This morning, I wasn't so sure.  I was on page 18 of said 58 and couldn't imagine June in any capacity.  But tonight, I can smell summer on the air and the light at the end of the tunnel doesn't seem quite as daunting.

      So the entries have been a bit spotty lately, I realize, and I hate it.  Well, not "hate" so much as "can't do a damn thing about it so we'll all just have to deal."  Been hanging at the Grind for the last few hours, perfecting the Property outline and feel pretty damn good about it, if not just a bit exhausted.  Still not quite sure I grasp the intricacies of real covenants as opposed to equitable servitudes, but the foundation's there and the gaps will be filled in due time.  Get to spend the weekend organizing the house of cards called Contracts, which actually feels like a break from the recent history of brief-writing and emotional gauntlet-running Saturdays and Sundays.    But I thought I'd take a minute and fill in some holes from the week, because I know I left you hanging:  The oral argument went well, just as everybody tried to assure me.  Yes, I froze on the first question, just as I'd feared.  But, just as promised, I warmed up and kicked ass thereafter.  Didn't quite get onto the second issue as quickly as I should have, but overall, I did very well.  Must have been the zipper.  Celebrated the week's major anniversary with a hot Girlie Exam.  You know, the one we all hate, dread and try to put off as long as we possibly can.  But at least I was finally getting some action...even if it was in a paper-thin cotton gown with a flashlight-equipped-speculum.  It was over pretty quick, to my relief (and dismay??), and I was left wondering whether I still have a "cervix they use to draw anatomy books."  That's what Gloria told me during my first exam and I've always been proud; no such luck this time, but I still like the idea of having a Textbook Cervix, so I'm gonna keep it around.

      "What am I going to ask Tori when I meet her?"  I asked the Boy one night a year and a week ago as we planned the impossible.  "I dunno...maybe you should ask Neil."    Just to remind you, dear readers, Neil is Neil Gaiman, author of the Sandman graphic novel series and several other venerable works.  He's one of our favorite obsessions, and that's saying a lot.  He has is own blog and an option for readers to send him questions.    "If he thinks it's not worth his time, he won't answer and you don't have to worry about it."  The Boy encouraged as I deliberated, already knowing I would.  We didn't want to be the crazed fans, after all.  We knew we were going to be so cool when we met our celebrities, because that's the only way to get them to realize how good friends we will all be.    I passed off the request for advice as a cool-headed college student just trying to handle the possible interview situation a bit better than her contemporaries.  But I couldn't sleep that night after receiving his response:  "The best thing to do with Tori is to throw away the list of questions, sit back and just chat.  She's wise, funny, kind and cool and it will be fine whatever you do.  Give her my best."    And so, a week later, I made my way up to Spokane early to hopefully catch a glimpse and perhaps an interview.  I knew at least I would ask about the Dew Drop Inn in London and get the picture signed for Levi, but if I could actually sit down and (gasp)  talk   with her, I wasn't quite sure what I'd do, but was confident in my ability to figure it out with the least amount of embarrassment.  There was a small group of 20-ish folks waiting when I arrived and it was clear I neither knew nor fit in with any of them.  Gay guys and goth girls lounged in the warm April sun and I sat off to the side, taking it all in, still trying to decide what I wanted her to sign if it came to that.  Eventually, they set up the barricade and we maneuvered around each other.  Veterans made sure those of us who had yet to meet her were moved to the front and we were grateful.    Then we waited.  We laughed with the security guard.  We bounced on our toes.  We sang her songs.  We watched her bus pull in.  We stopped breathing whenever the stage entrance door opened.   Finally, she walked out.  She answered questions and started signing items for people in the back before making her way down the front line of folks crunched against the metal barricade.  By now it was clear I wouldn't be wasting any contact I had with her in a request for an interview; she could say no and walk on down the line.  Besides, this was a time for fans and their artist, and the fan (obsessive and obnoxious as I can be) won.  I had to remember to take pictures and keep inhaling.  Then she was talking to the girl standing next to me, who asked for a picture; Tori handed me the girl's digital camera and took my to-be-signed-items from me.  I still feel bad about how terrible the pictures must have turned out; all hand-eye coordination was lost, as though I hadn't even seen a camera before, let alone knew how to operate one.    Then she was asking my name and I hoped I wouldn't smudge the song requests she'd written on her hand as I shook it.  I couldn't form a complete thought or sentence.  I was that person I promised myself I would never be when meeting celebrities.  No shame, no control; just gibberish and gush.  But she threw me a bone:  "So, how're things?"    "Things are good!!"  I exclaimed.    My god her eyes are green.  She still has your things in her hands.  Say something about them!!    "That picture you're holding?"  "Oh!  Look at that!"    "My best friend and I went in London, thinking we'd find this hip-happenin' place we wouldn't be able to get into, and when we got there we couldn't, but for a completely different reason."   Did I just get all that out in one breath?   "Yea, well, this isn't it," she explained with a soft smile.  "They're kinda scattered all over the country..."  "I know!!  My grandparents owned one in Paul, Idaho!  We just thought this was a gay piano bar in London and figured it had to be you!"  "My girlfriends used to say to each other when we needed to get out of somewhere...like code for 'Let's get the fuck outta here'...let's go to the Dew Drop Inn.  So, how am I spelling this?"  And she moved along the line, hugging some, remembering the names of others and asking about their families.  The whole thing was pretty surreal, to the point where I (again) had to remind myself to take pictures and remember every instant because   this was really happening  .    It didn't hit until she'd gone back inside to prepare for the evening's concert.  It didn't seem real until I called the Boy.   I sent Neil the link for the  urlLink review of the show , not thinking he'd actually read it or even respond, but just in case...  He did.    "Good review.  Nice job."    The whole thing still comes around and surprises me every once in a while.  I smile when I catch a glimpse of my name in her easy, generous script when I'm doing sun salutations in the living room.  I relax when I see her picture on my carrel at school.    When I blasted into my apartment in August, rushing to change clothes in order to get to law school orientation, for which I was 4 hours late, I thought:  "You can handle this.  You met Tori!"

      I'm freaking out.  Have my oral argument in less than 4 hours and can't sit still; can't get my palms to stop sweating; can't focus on my breath; can't get the vision of freezing in front of "The Court" when they ask me an easy, obvious question I've been rehearsing for 3 days.    The fucking thing's not even graded for god's sake.    I'm reminded of my days of high school debate, when the morning before each competition brought similar symptoms (not indications of a disability or request for accommodation, mind you) and I wondered why I even got myself involved in this shit.  But, once the round began and I stepped up to the podium, took a deep breath and began, I was fine and in the zone.    My cold finally took hold last night around 3, when I awoke with terror and avoidance plans, and the medicine is providing a nice haze to the already adrenaline-fuzzy world.    Thank god my power suit has a zipper.  The Chief Justice loves gals with zippers.

      It's been an interesting few days.  Taking today pretty easy; partly to recover from the previous two and partly because I finally can relax, if only for a few hours.  The fan's in the window and the spring air's circulating nicely through the apartment.  As though the emotional changes, growing, and sharing wasn't enough (we'll get to that in a minute), the whole experience has just been topped off by an email from (you'll never guess) Lorraine and I'm sitting here in a new place at last.    Something's been building for the last few months, something not-so-vaguely resembling the final blow-up/breakdown before the Age of Silence this November.  But, with the gift of experience and Susan's advice, I've been able to prevent any nasty expectations from causing more trouble than they're worth and have been able to accept anything Lorraine's given me by way of communication in the last few weeks.  It seems I'm still a problem; an issue, sword, card  to be unleashed only in the most heated, raw discussions.  Despite all her best efforts to maintain peace and balance between us all, Lorraine seems to be losing.  And rather than rushing to her aid, to be there, to listen and to hold (albeit over the phone), I've sat back and waited, resisting the urge every bit of myself is compelled to act upon.  Reading her message today, I found myself waiting for the spark of being slighted, of being put aside in the interest of waiting to see how things worked themselves out.  It never came.  Instead, I felt incredibly sad for how she must be feeling and smiled when I pictured her outside, playing in the dirt.  I will be here when she needs me, but I won't be counting the minutes until she does.  Not out of indigence (finally), but out of patience, trust, and resolve.  I can't attribute my reaction entirely to the experience of this weekend, but I can't deny its impact, either.  And when I think about it, what we did as a group wasn't that extraordinary.  We sat in a room, walked across it a few times and talked.  But walking across a room can be the most difficult, profound thing one can do when one's exposing more about the self than one ever thought or intended to do.  And that's what we did for a day and a half; even when we weren't in the "walking" exercise, we exposed ourselves, sometimes to the core, and held one another together as a cohesive, bonded group afterward.    The idea was to learn how to be more multiculturally competent in order to better serve our clients, colleagues and ourselves.  In so doing, I didn't expect to delve quite so deep into who I am as a person or to listen quite so intently to the people around me.  But, if you want to make the world a better place, free of bias and injustice, the first place to start is yourself.  By the end of the day, I didn't want to leave the room and renter the world at large.  I felt like we'd done so much work together and how was I ever going to incorporate something so big and meaningful into my everyday life?    I guess I'll figure that out as I go along, and I can already tell nothing will compare to the ride.

      Been having a bit of over-extension stress the last few days, but a nice, long, brisk walk around campus putting up fliers for a lecture next week I know very little about (which may not be the best way to begin an administration, but what the hell?) with the Prez makes the mountain of tasks waiting back at my desk seem entirely more do-able and perhaps a bit pleasurable.    Beers and jazz at Pullman's intellectual bar is still in the running, but have a few hours to get through before anything's known for sure.    Back to work...

      It's just not the summer blockbuster season until the first disaster movie is released.  So now we can get on with the business of all the other big summer blockbusters, because really, "The Day After Tomorrow" doesn't serve many other purposes.  Don't get me wrong, its special effects are incredible and the movie does its job of providing a 2-hour eye-candy-fest perfectly.  But I couldn't help thinking, watching six tornadoes sweep through and demolish Los Angeles with stunning detail, "Someone get Helen Hunt on the phone!"  But it was a nice way to spend a couple of hours on an empty, lazy day during an empty lazy weekend.  The only thing on the agenda for the rest of the night is some hard-core futon time with a young wizard.  Yay.    But first, a story...  H'ok so, the whole "gay subject" has always been a delicate one with the parents.  It was the first issue that created a rift between them and me, even in the days before I knew about myself.  They didn't think themselves homophobic; they just preferred it if gay folks just stayed "over there" and kept quiet about the whole thing.  And really, that's where they remain on the subject, even knowing about me.  It's not that surprising, and they've been much better about it than so many other parents in the world.    But any conversations about my sexuality have been very touch and go, very few and far between.  The last talk my dad and I had about it came a month after I came out to them in October of 1999 and ended with slamming doors.    Finally had to quell their last hope that I would one day embrace my feelings for Levi for what they clearly were and get over this whole gay thing last summer by letting them know that not only was my best friend and their best chance for a son-in-law gay, but it looked like it was going to stay that way for me, too.  Mom and I managed to have our first conversation about the whole thing since the outing and it appeared that some progress had been made during the years in between.  She still couldn't say the word, but at least she didn't cry.    And so, there've been baby steps for months.  Talking about my new law school friends, sometimes it had to be addressed.    "So, is Susan married?"  "Umm, no...."   Let it go, Mom, I'm not in the mood to go there.    "Divorced?"  "Noooo..."   Alright, I guess we're going there.     Pause.  "There  is  a third option." I said with a laugh.  "I knowww..." she replied with a long sigh, but managed to change the subject without this disclosure ruining the entire conversation.    Then came the Christmas holiday during which The Boy made an extended stay at the Mountain Fortress.  We toned it down a bit, but there were times our banter strayed into the area marked by rainbow flags.  And shockingly enough, the world didn't end.  Mom would usually either ignore us or mutter something about how she didn't want to hear about it, all the while keeping one ear on the conversation.    During the slow evolution and turnings of small corners, I've been content to be patient and steer clear from that topic of conversation.  They've been able to put the information in another place and not let it change how they are toward me, how they feel about me, and for that I'm grateful.  Meanwhile, I'm sure they've been dealing with it in their own ways and I've had no cause to disrupt their process.    Until I met someone, that is.    Hadn't mentioned anything about Miss Vicious in the last two weeks, despite the routine questions of "How was Bozeman?", "How's the week been going?", etc. and before long, it felt as though I was keeping something hidden.  It's a familiar feeling, and one I have no desire to relive.  And so, I decided to tell Mom about her when she made her weekly check-in call.    There weren't any opportunities to bring up the subject by the time we'd exhausted all the other topics, and when Mom asked "You wanna talk to Dad?" I thought about just saying yes and waiting until next time.    Instead, I said "Actually, I need to talk to you about something."  She let out one of her signature sighs, telling me she had an idea of where this talk was headed and was none too happy about it.    "I will tell you as much or as little as you want, but I just think you should know...I've met someone."  (Insert brief recounting of the Boy's matchmaking here.)  "You're just hell-bent on this, aren't you?" she asked, probably through a bit of tears, wishing I would surprise her.  "I'm not hell-bent on anything, Mom, this is just the way it is."   "So," she said, trying to keep her bearings, "what do you think?"  "I want to see where it's going.  We're not talking about moving in together, and we don't really know what's going to happen with her there and me here, but we both want to see where it's going to lead."  "And this is the first time you've had these romantic feelings for someone..." she started.  "Well, not the first time, but it's the first time it's happened this way.  I've felt like I've been keeping something from you by not saying anything and I don't want to do that."  "Well, I'm glad you said something.  I always figured you would if you needed to talk.  What's her name?...."  The conversation about Vicious herself didn't last very long, and it quickly became what I knew it would be when I brought it up, another turning point.  "So how are you doing with..." She still can't say the word.  "With what?"  "You know...with all this stuff."  "I'm fine, Mom.  Really.  I have been for a long time."  "Good, I'm glad."  "And really, you guys can always ask or talk to me about anything you want to..."  "Oh, I don't think we'll be doing that, dear."  She said with a laugh that was part nerves, part painful and no parts humor.  "I don't mean about this in particular, I mean about in general.  It's been in the news a lot recently, and I just thought I could be a good resource if you wanted to talk about anything."  "I don't think we'll be the ones to bring it up, dear; we're just going to have to deal with it.  I know it's not going to change, and it makes me feel bad."  "Why?"  "Because...you know...you won't have kids..."  "Mom, I plan on having kids, they're part of the long-term plan."  "Are you sure you want to do...that...with a kid?  I mean, I know you think it's so mainstream now, but it really isn't."  I put the sting from her question away for a minute so I could answer the question honestly, hopefully keeping this conversation an open exchange of information.  "It's something I know I'll think about seriously in another 10 years, when I have someone I want to be with forever and we both decide we want them.  But I don't think 'Oh shit, there goes kids.'"  "I know," she said, "it's just that it's so hard and always will be.  I guess you can decide where you live and that could make it easier...Maybe you and Levi could have kids together."  "Well, he is on the top of the sperm donor list."  So, she wasn't talking about "being gay" not being the right thing to do with a kid, she was worried about the surrounding atmosphere.  Part of me smiled at that realization.   "And it IS everywhere now," she continued.  "The hardest thing for me is how it becomes so wrapped up in who the person is, and it shouldn't.  I hate that that's who Rosie and Ellen are now.  It's not who the person is and I hate that it's such a big deal.  I just want it to be something that doesn't have to be announced, that it's just something about a person and it's not a big deal."  "Well, that's what a lot of people want too, but in order to get to that place, we have to go through this place where it is a big deal."  "I guess," she said, sounding resigned and I sensed an opportunity to actually share my feelings in a way I hadn't before.  "I can't get inside those people's heads who come out and then are forever labeled as the 'gay-this', but I imagine some of them wouldn't want to be attributed that any more than you want to hear it.  It's something that happens to them after they've come out, over which I imagine they have little control.  And really, I think a lot of gay people want to get to that place, too, where it isn't a big deal, it's just something you hear about and go on.  But if it really is to be not a big deal and something that just happens to be part of who someone is, then we ought to be able to have the same opportunities and same rights as everyone else.  When things get closer to equal, it may not be such a big deal.  But as long as there's a difference, it's going to be a big deal."  "Is this what you're going to do with your law degree?" she asked with another nervous laugh.     The conversation eventually, and comfortably, moved to other things.  But it's stayed in my mind for much of the day, as I'm sure it has for her, as well.  They're getting easier, these talks; maybe one day she'll have what she wants: the ability to know about it and move on.

       urlLink    Memories of the Super Students Bender....&nbsp; urlLink      Okay, so, added the lovely feature that lets me post pictures to the bloggy!  Yay!  And the only appropriate maiden picture was the Infamous White Board of 1428: The Den of the Stellar Super Students.  Each exam had its own rallying cry, drawn from its respective study sessions.  The surrounding quotes were faves over the two weeks, but didn't quite reach the level of exam-theme, if you will.  So there ya have it.  Suppose I could post a key for all those non-Stellar Super Student readers:  "Strawman!" = Property flashcards session at 1428.  Emily was all over the red flags hidden in the fact patters.    "Eyes on the Prize!" = Contracts food-run to Tideymans.  Emily and I had to focus ourselves on our breaks to ensure our continued studying once we returned from the store.  "Hello, bullets!" = Criminal Law flashcards at the Eastside Marketplace.  Emily found the disorganized meshing of multiple factors to consider troublesome while Calamity Jane and I pictured a shoot-out in the card's fact pattern.  "Sharon!!" = Civil Procedure flashcards at 1428.  The first study session with the new hair do was to be the one during which I finally received a nickname.  We couldn't remember who the other twin was from The Parent Trap, but Emily reminded us shortly as we dug through our Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, shrieking out:  "Sharon!"  The extra exclamation point was added after the name evolved into an Ozzy Ozborne impression.  "25.5 for 130." = Torts study session at the Grind.  Emily reminded us that we had 25.5 hours in which to study for a 130 minute exam.    And that's how it really happened.    Have more to post later, involving another big gay milestone with Mom this morning, but it deserves its own post and I deserve a bit of mindless Summer Blockbuster entertainment, so I'm off to see "The Day After Tomorrow."  Look out Global Warming.

      So I'm hangin' out at my carrel in the law school basement.  Thought I'd drop by and pick up everything I'd left; needed some distance from all the books, paper, shelves and dingey old books.  Putting the books I didn't sell back on Half.com, trying not to think about how much I paid for them as I set the sale price.    It's weird being here now:  all the empty desks, some cleaned out, some apparently recently used.  Enjoying the Wi-Fi, but will be happy to leave this place behind for good this afternoon.  Think I'll spend the afternoon at the Grind, catching up on web surfing and reading.  Yay.   Yea, gonna go through all the notebooks and trash all the precious notes, sort out what needs to be kept and lock it all away in the big gay office upstairs until it's needed again in three months.  Think I might take the long route to the Grind, too.  The day is trying to be nice, with the Superman Blue sky peeking in around the gray rainclouds, but it's still too nippy to enjoy sans the protection of windows.    Good times.

      "Not like anyone's going to notice I'm gone, anyway," my supervisor grumbled as we paid for our fabulous lunches.  The joint-dining experience has become the standard routine with nary a word said about the matter.    "Really, that office is sitting empty right now," I joined in.  It's Friday of a three-day weekend and even though people are at work, no one is at work.    "Oh well," she said, cheering, "I'm leaving at 3, no matter what.  I have annual leave."  "Yea, and I'll stay 'til 530."  "Wow.  You're hard-core."  "No, I'm paid by the hour."

      And that's only 7 months away; but at the rate I'm going, it might not be that far-fetched.    It's been quite a week.  Full of twists and turns, excitements and adventures, some more enjoyable than others.  But they've all lead to this place and, as promised by the stars, was all worth it.    H'OK, SO...  much time has been spent sorting out the whole 'where is this going' question.  I know, before you even start yelling at your computer, I KNOW!  It's too much thinking, over-thinking, planning and re-planning.  I'm working on it, okay?  Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that I'm down for the ride; I'm ready to see what's coming and where this will take us.  I'm game for whatever happens.  And that's a new place to be, really.  I'm not one who gives up control or its illusion easily, especially when there's no indication or assurances of what  could  or  might be  happening.  Haven't quite gotten down the art of trusting in nothing but a feeling, but it's getting easier.  But finally emerging from the haze of trying to pin every possibility down and analyzing it to death in order to figure out if its a winner or not was pretty liberating and lived up to all the hype.    And that's how the week began.  Open and ready for whatever came next.  Just wasn't ready for what ended up happening (do we see a pattern, here?).   SO YEA...  couldn't find this new girl consuming many of my thoughts.  Our schedules are kinda scattered to begin with and our conversations thus far have been fitted into whatever open slots come our way, so it wasn't too big a deal at first.  Before long, though, started worrying about something I may have said, not said, done, not done, etc.  Of course, now we have that wonderful friend, hindsight, to show us the truth of the circumstances, but at the time, I just had a mind reeling with too many possibilities and explanations that may or may not be the case because I couldn't talk to the one person who could reassure me.  Maybe she just needed time to digest everything; maybe she was caught up in personal issues having nothing to do with me; maybe...  You get the idea.    AND SO...  I tried to give her what it appeared she needed, space and time.  But patience has never been one of my strong points, especially when the situation involves someone I care about.  I want whatever the problem is to be fixed yesterday, especially if there's anything I can do to fix it.  But I couldn't do anything here because I didn't know what was going on in the first place.    AND THEN...  came home from work last night, trying to be strong, trying to be brave, and almost convinced myself I could pull off the whole 'patient' thing when it became quite apparent I needed to do some evening pages (the evening counterpart to morning pages).  Sure enough, they did their job.  And after about half an hour of quality pen and paper time (while watching a flash flood outside the window, appropriately enough), I looked up, felt incredibly lighter and as though something had finally been released for good.  By the end of writing everything out, I was smiling. Because the ride's been a wonderful one and whatever happens, it's been worth it; wouldn't change a thing.  I could wait forever to hear from her again, if that's what she needed.    AND REALLY...  the only thing to do after a major breakthrough in understanding yourself is to put on the new Alanis Morissette CD while doing some hard-core yoga, and I'll be goddamned if it's not a pretty good album!  As a brief aside, the CD is pretty much like all the others:  hate it at first, then it's okay, and pretty  soon it's kinda alright!  Yes, there's some songs that just suck, and this whole 10-song thing is complete shit, but the good songs, are really great and I can't get enough of them.  Then curled up on the couch and finished the first Harry Potter book, which is such the perfect re-introduction to reading for pleasure.  Thanks, Emily.  You Rock.    AND THEN...  around 3, the phone rings.  And I jump out of bed, run to the phone and am sooo excited that we're doing the late-night, 'I couldn't wait until morning' call, only to find someone else on the other end.  Fine, it's my friend April and we have a few laughs before she graciously lets me go back to sleep, trying to maintain the new peace and understanding I'd found.    SO TODAY...  managed to keep the momentum going from the night before.  Made it through the day without planning a damn thing or over-analyzing a single thought.  How novel!!  And sure enough, after my most excellent yoga class, I had a message waiting for me and a gal to talk to.  She's been sick all week, poor thing.  Spending the days in bed or in doctor's offices, talking with people who don't know how to help her; unable to do everything she wants to do: be with her friends before they all become scattered, talk to and take care of the people she cares about, etc.  She's been resigned to bed rest and that's the worst.      AND SOOO...  we chatted for the first time since Monday night and it was perfect.  Comfortable, easy and adorable.    FINALLY...  here I find myself, still here, still smiling (while shaking my head at myself), feeling good all over, and down for whatever else the stars have in mind.  Yes, you were right, dear friends and dear horoscopes: patience, going with the flow, and giving up the tight hold on invisible reigns are our new friends.  I apparently need to have the same lesson given over and over before it starts to sink in, but each time, I get the hang of it a bit better.

      My fortune from today's lunch said:  "You are apt to give too much thought to appearance."    Hmm...seems appropriate, I thought and then said to myself.    My new supervisor, whom I was lunching with, who is a few months younger than myself and honestly believes Gwenyth deserved the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love over Cate's Elizabeth, looked me over and said:  "Mmm...not really."

      I don't know how she does it, but Tori has a way.  Never really thought about her as a therapy mechanism, but lately, nothing appeals more or helps take my mind off things as much as she does.    Thanks, ol' girl.

      I'd forgotten the roller coaster ride these things bring.    I remember the newness, how heightened everything seems in the beginning, trying to find my way through old feelings resurfacing in wonderfully new ways.    I remember the steps on the way to getting to know someone, really 'knowing.'  But I'd forgotten how quickly everything can change over so small a thing.  How suddenly the day can transform into something completely different than how it began and somehow circle back again by the end.    I'm remembering now why the tides are so frequently forgotten.  If we didn't forget, we wouldn't try again.     And I'm reminded tonight that the ride, with everything it brings, is still preferable to the alternative.

      Some things that have happened this morning to cheer me out of my all-too-pensive mood:  Blue skies and warm sun;  Random cheerful conversation with a janitor on the elevator;  Getting close to $100 for Property and Contracts books;  Finding a note left by the Office Goddess that she managed to sneak my hours from last week in under the wire, which means I'll be getting paid the 4th instead of the 18th;  Checking the web for any posted grades:  Torts: B+ (one grade-level improved)  Contracts:  B+ (three grade-levels improved)

      why we love May: It gives us the song of summer.  During the month that sets the tone for the entire summer, we find the song that sets the tone for the soundtrack for the next three months.    To illustrate, here are the last few summer themes:  2001:  Elevation, U2  2002:  We Are Made of Stars, Moby  2003:  Hollywood, Madge  2004:  Let it Go, Frou Frou

      Yes, yet another new look.  What can I say?  It's a time for new things.  Emily started a new blog last night and I caught sight of this template and decided I had to have it.  The WSU-colors were starting to get to me, so you know.    So today's the first day of having absolutely nothing to do, nowhere to be, and it feels spectacular.  Slept in until 10, didn't get out of bed until 11, watched two episodes of Queer as Folk before even getting in the shower.  Working on my pile of laundry now and pumped out three, count 'em THREE morning pages!  And it's only 2!  Think the only time I'll leave the abode is to take back the DVD and the rest of the day will be spent puttering around, perhaps cleaning, perhaps not, and starting some new books.  I've been instructed by more than one person to read the Harry Potter series, collected 1 through 4 from Emily last night, and as I find myself in between books, it only seems right to dig in this afternoon.    H'ok, so...the morning began drenched, soppy and gray.  Now it's sunny, blue skies and only marginally warmer.  Still going to watch it from inside.  It's such a day to sit, do very little, but relish every moment and every thought; letting everything surround you, settle and swirl inside.  Have so much to bask in and now that I'm letting myself to precisely that, it feels terrific.  On the second round of the Frou Frou CD, with no sign of stopping.    Suppose I could describe the person more than partially responsible for all this, seeing as how the majority of you readers know nothing other than what has already been posted here.  It may be a bit disjointed and random, but perhaps just right, too.  Hope she doesn't mind.  She's a hero in the making.  Already is in so many ways and can't wait to finish the journey.    She wants to be five years older because she's outgrown her contemporaries and so wants to be the person she knows she's becoming.    She shares Karen's (of the Jack and Karen hour) mentor.    She's loyal to a fault.  She laughs easy, loud and often.  She's generous with herself, but fiercely protects her vulnerability.  She'll make an elaborate meal for her friends and go to bed with a peanut butter sandwich for herself.  She reminds me of someone I used be.    She's spontaneous, charming and kind.   She lives in the moment, and not one has been the same since she walked through the Boy's door.

      Cue hand draped across the forehead and longing gaze in lead-actress' eye, one that appears gooey and romantic, and is, but also has more carnal images dancing behind it.  Then she speaks and people listen:  "One week ago tonight..."

      I know it's too much, but I can't get enough of this astrology shit lately, just deal with it!!  This is a respectfully-snipped excerpt from my May horoscope...fucking creepy.    "This month will have its plusses and minuses. What else is new? Always the practical one, a Capricorn gets upset at nothing I say. Bless your heart. Your balanced, practical approach to life is the secret of your success and the envy of your friends. I love your spirit. Don't ever change!   Let's start at the top of the month and go through each aspect in chronological order.   Yay!  Let's do it to it!!   (edit)  One tough day is sure to be May 25 when Mars will meet up with Saturn. They will stand toe-to-toe in your seventh house of committed relationships. Mars will make you ache to be assertive, while Saturn will say, "Wait! Not yet! Give this time"! Saturn will win this contest, so you might as well resign yourself to being patient.  Think this has already happened, but okay, whatever.   This matter has to do with a romantic or business partner, and you will feel this aspect gaining in power for the whole second half of the month as it reaches perfection.   I love perfection!   (edit)  At the end of September 2004, Jupiter, the giver of gifts and luck, will enter the zenith of your chart, your tenth house and ruler of your career status and promotion. It will be the first time in twelve years that Jupiter has visited this house.   About damn time!   This is a sensational prospect. Jupiter will remain in this house for thirteen MONTHS! This is the best and biggest aspect you could possibly want for professional advancement. But wait! There is more! In mid-October, five planets - half the solar system - will crowd into your sector of fame and honors, making October 2004 one for the record books.  That October always finds a way.   It's important that you don't let Venus retrograde get you down in the dumps or distract you from your purpose.  Stupid Venus.  Everything you are doing now will count toward your impending victory in late September or October, so you want to keep your record strong. You have been waiting literally years for this massive opportunity, and you will want to be in a position to take full advantage of it.  Shit damn right!   Venus also rules romance, of course, and with Venus in your sixth house of work projects, you could become smitten with a coworker or a supplier who you come in contact with frequently.  Like my dealer?   In general, there are some key points to consider when Venus goes retrograde. May 17 to June 29 would not be a good time to schedule plastic surgery.  It would not be the time to launch a big party, spend a great deal of money on clothes or jewelry, or go to that la-de-da spa.  Well, shit, what's the point?   (edit)  Some of the best news of the month concerns romance. Married or single, on May 19 your love life will get a huge boost by the new moon in Taurus. If you are single, even with Venus retrograde you should see a new romantic, social influence start to dominate your life.  Maybe a little bit!   After a long drought, your love life should start to sparkle and it will become easier for you to meet a new romantic partner. A friend seems willing to make an interesting introduction - allow her ( you mean him? ) to do so.  Shut the fuck up.     (edit)   Speaking about talent, you may show off a wonderful talent yourself this month. This new moon will bring out your creativity in a big way. If you work in a creative field, there will be no limit to what you will be capable of turning out. A new moon brings two weeks of very, very powerful energy, dear Capricorn. It is there for you to use or - if you don't take advantage of it - to lose.  Sucker.  I'm coming evening pages, I promise.       Jupiter, the great benefic planet, has been retrograde since January 3 and will turn direct on May 4. This is sensational news because Jupiter will begin to work very hard for you for the rest of 2004! As a result, exciting travel may come up now or later. (Mid-September appears to be a major time for a journey.)  Journeys rock!   If you want to travel during May, you will have two distinct moments when this would be a fabulous idea:   First, from Saturday, May 15 to Monday, May 17 you may take an unexpected short trip that will turn out splendid.   And it did.     On Friday, May 21 though Sunday, May 23, you may take a long trip. If so, it would work out sensationally well. You will have the action of Mars combined with the blessings of lucky Jupiter to thank for these golden days.   If you choose not to travel, you may find the dates mentioned will stand out to advance educational interests, international commerce, citizenship, relationships, or a publishing or legal matter.  Oh good!  That book I've been writing about a secret community of junior honors English professors who travel abroad and become embroiled in the white slave trade with Irish-American militants while exploring their growing mass attraction for their tour guide/attorney, Hanz, will finally be published this weekend!!  SCORE!   So you see, dear Capricorn, you do have some very dazzling aspects along with some less-than-perfect ones. Your sign is known to have a great sense of humor - the best of any sign in the zodiac. This month, laugh. It will be your best tonic, along with love and affection, which should be in full force this month, too!"  All in all, a pretty good one, I'd say.

      No morning pages today, either, and I'm feeling their absence, but it won't get me down today like it did Wednesday; I have my Darth Maul coffee cup to protect me!  Needed the sleep-time after another late-night conversation.  We love communication, especially when it leads to new places.    And so, we come to Friday.  The big boss is gone and I can already feel a lazy day taking shape.  Been here for more than a few minutes and have yet to start working.  Reading The Boy's big blog and talking to the fans mulling through the office takes a while!

      I read a horoscope like this and things don't seem so bad...  "Even if relationships, work responsibilities, or your finances are causing sleepless nights, try to put your mind at rest.  Once you stop expecting the worst, your life will (eventually) fall into perfect place.  You're holding an astrological winner's ticket promising success and fulfillment, but it will take time and patience before you collect on it.  Don't lose heart--instead lose some of the weight on your shoulders."  We love you, Vogue!

      Missing everyone today.    It's a combination of the rainy weather (where's summer?!), skipping morning pages yesterday (might have to institute an evening pages regimen), hormones (PMS is the devil), and being far away from everyone I want to be with.    Trying to pull myself out of the funk with the Summer Mix, but it's just reminding me of good times and the people sharing them.    And really, the whole "detached" approach is a bunch of crap and is not working in the least.  Part of me is ready to jump in with both feet and let whatever may happen happen and part of me needs to make sure this doesn't get away from me before it even starts.    Sigh.

      It's an odd feeling, really, to have what you've been waiting for sitting across from you, giving you a look you've undoubtedly given others in their awkward moments.    And it's even more odd to return home to a life that, when you left, was hitting such a peak with nothing but more adventures on the horizon, now seems so disjointed, off-balance and brand new.    But I'm getting ahead of myself.  During the last few months, I've felt as though I was hurling toward something.  Something intangible, unknown, but unmistakable in its presence or importance.  The feeling became lost in the furor of the last few weeks of class, but re-emerged the more The Boy told me about this girl.  She sounded just right.  Too many damn coincidences  to be, well...coincidence, and since we don't really believe in coincidences anyway, they quickly became a big pile of signs.  Signs I couldn't wait to investigate, but much too big an idea to contemplate for very long, especially with five exams in two weeks to prepare for.  So, the Weekend After Finals became legendary before it even came to pass; it was the perfect motivation to get through the last stretch, the best subject for daydreams and the subject on most of my friends' lips the night of the big finale, the eve of my departure.    Had no real clear idea of what I was heading into, only that she'd won the Boy over, loved everything we love, and sounded exactly like me in more than a few ways.  To a self-proclaimed narcissist, that sounded pretty damn sweet!  I was going to be smooth, calm, confident, devastatingly charming and irresistible.  Then we'd see what happened.    What happened was absolutely nothing I anticipated and everything I hoped it would be.    She grew on me with every passing moment and I found myself quickly unraveling, quite unexpectedly and uncomfortably.  Saturday night found the three of us at her place with Kill Bill and Queer as Folk.  We all laughed at all the same scenes, finished the same lines and bantered with ad-libs.  Before I knew it, I was cuddling with someone for the first time in a year, and was terrified.  Not terrified enough to stop, mind you; no, it felt entirely too good to ruin with too much thinking.  Eventually, the credits rolled and we had a few moments alone, the moments I was craving and dreading.  Her calm, confident, devastatingly charming demeanor was entirely unnerving and completely comforting.  Here I had precisely what I'd been wanting and I couldn't move or even look her in the eye because when I did, I saw nothing but patience and understanding.  We managed to fashion a memorable goodbye at her door that couldn't have been more sweet, only to be followed by my graceless exit.    Now, I don't do well with confusion, especially my own.  And while I was relishing the night and how perfectly it ended, I tried to figure out just what the fuck was happening to me.  The last (first) time anything like this happened, I didn't think about it, just jumped in with both feet and was the comforting, steadying presence.  And now I didn't like being the one in need of comfort and steadying one bit; except for how incredible it felt.    And so, much of Sunday was spent in this place, filtering out my feelings, deciphering the sensations and trying like hell to reclaim my comfort zone, all the while trying to figure out how to reach over and hold her hand as we drove through the rainy forest.    The afternoon found our small gang back at The Boy's apartment, he and I telling story after story, each with three stories' worth of backstory and context-setting.  Found myself soothed by her quiet but solid presence and felt the tension between my shoulders melt away beneath her impromptu massage.  While Levi took a call in the other room, an opportunity to put the entire uncertainty mess to rest presented itself.  And, shockingly enough, the fog was lifted immediately after talking with her about the last day, how utterly discombobulated I'd become and listening to her say exactly what I needed to hear.  No pressure, no strings, we would go wherever this took us, at the very least becoming great friends in the process.  And as is the way with such talks, everything changed after this one; felt re-connected, more balanced and anxious to explore the feelings and sensations that had me in knots hours before.    The Boy and she decided the only way to end the weekend was with "Love Actually."  They were right.  For the second time in as many days, I found myself suggled beneath her comforter, her front glued to my back, and as much as I loved every scene, the damn movie couldn't have been over soon enough.  Eventually, though, we cleared her cozy apartment of its guests, and were left to our own devices at last.    The reel of that time together hasn't stopped playing behind my eyes all day and I'm sitting here in my own cozy apartment feeling disjointed, off-balance and brand new.  But finally, it's a good thing and I can't wait to see what happens next.

      Hey Kids...  We're coming to you live from Bozeman and the other side of the first year of law school.  It still hasn't sunk in yet, but we're getting there.  Summer hasn't hit Bozeman with full-force, either, but we'll make do with the mid-60s.  The Boy and I are hitting the strip mall today, reliving our faux-wedded-bliss experience from Spring Break.  The Pier 1 sales girl really wanted to sell us a dining table and flatware.  Stupid bitch.    So the last exam went well.  It was easily a 3 hour exam crammed into 2 hours; actually, less because it took 30 minutes to even read the whole fact pattern.  But overall, feeling pretty damn good about the entire exam period.  Also received our Appellate Briefs at the end of the Torts exam.  Turned out to be my lowest grade of the three making up our final for the class, but ended up with an A- for the entire year.  And that makes me smile.  The evening that followed wasn't so much a huge explosion of celebration and rejoicing as it was a relieving time among friends who had all endured the same adventure.    The drive yesterday felt really good.  Always find such solace and renewal on long drives.  It's the music, the endless empty miles, the shifting landscapes and hurling oneself toward some destination as fast as possible.    And so, we come to the big dinner....  The Boy is an excellent cook, there was much rejoicing, laughter and flowing wine.  Miss Vicious lived up to the hype and husky-Jodie-Foster-only-deeper voice.  The pubescent cracking of said voice was particularly cute.  The Boy and I regaled her and friend Sally with stories of the old and not so old times.  They heard about the Day of Noodle-Making over Christmas break and laughed as hard as the Boy and I did when it happened.  At 10, we made our way out into the gritty meanstreets of Bozeman by stopping at the uber-swank wine bar, Thunk.  We probably looked like young riff-raff without any clue, but our hot waitress was hot and didn't judge us.  We giggled over the Cherry Explosion selection, wondering if it held a prophecy.  It went down entirely too smooth and too fast, and soon we found ourselves at the bar Levi's been talking about for two years, The Starling.    Not knowing what follows wine best, I let Miss Vicious buy me a beer and received a tour of the establishment with this Amazon on my arm.  Eventually, our gang found a quiet corner in which to gasp over the appearance of Daniel elsewhere in the bar.  I had yet to see the new man who had wooed the Boy and then kicked him in the gut, and we three gals counseled Levi on how to handle the situation.  Before long, Vicious set her drink down and said, "I'm going down there.  Pull some Vicious action on his ass."  And sure enough, within 10 minutes, Dan came 'round, looking to talk to the Boy he'd ignored all week.    While they went off to see if they could save whatever was growing between them, the new hero on the block and I had more than a few moments to chat.  We started with the usual:  what do you want to be when you grow up, etc., which led into some tales of personal adversity and ultimate triumph, not entirely unlike the first real conversation I had with another Libra in a coffee shop 9 months ago.  As we came around to the optimism and hope that best serves as endings to such tales, the Boy rejoined us and became the focus of our attention.  Their talk had gone well; points made, apologies given and a new start on a friendship ahead of them.  Yay.    After some piled snuggling on a tattered leather couch, we all were fading fast, as were the remnants of V's voice.  And so, we made our departures, promising to connect today and see what new adventures we could have together.    This morning's been spent in much the same way most mornings in Bozeman are: one of us wakes up first, jumps into bed with the other for an hour of dozing, snuggling and chatting.  Then we're on the couch with our breakfast and coffee for at least another hour,chatting some more, looking through new magazines, solving the world's problems, etc. before one starts morning pages or blogging, all the while planning the day as though we still have most of it at our disposal.  Finally, it dawns on us that it's almost noon and someone should get in the shower if we're going to do half of the things we've just spent all morning talking about.    And so, since he just finished with his shower, it would appear to be my turn...

      So yea, in less than five hours, the first year will be complete and we'll all be 2nd years.  It's fucking bizarre is what it is.  And I can't stop smiling.  Been tidying up all morning, puttering around to get rid of the energy generated by excitement and nerves.  Still have yet to type up the notes from the last day of Torts class, but don't feel too bad about it.  Suppose I should look at my notes one last time before the exam, but I'm having a hard time pulling myself away from the Seattle Mix of '02 and the pics from the last two weeks' study sessions.    A year ago at this time I was tidying up in anticipation of the parents' and grandparents' arrival for the big graduation.  The weather was pretty similar, except that we'd actually had snow instead of just rain and chilly winds.  And I think today marks the one-year anniversary of the Morning Pages.  Started them the Thursday before Graduation, although the date in the notebook is a bit off.  Stupid leap-year anyway.  Let's just go ahead and say it was a year ago today, m'kay?  Feels like another life.  But then again, so does studying for the Property final two weeks ago.    There's been much moaning and groaning about school, exams, classes and even a couple professors during the last two weeks, much of it completely warranted and justified.  But I'm still sitting here smiling as I think back on the year.  It's an interesting feeling, in this time before the End.  Tomorrow will come and life will go on almost as usual, but for today, an entire experience hangs suspended, about to come to a close.  It's a time for celebration and release, but it's also a bit sad, as all endings are.    And I always cry at endings.

      The last study day of the year finds us gals in the Meeting Room of the Daily Grind.  Feeling pretty good about this last exam; it's Torts, I like the subject, have a pretty good grip on the material and the exam is only two hours.  The longest question is only half an hour; the rest is a mix of 20 and 10 minute questions.  Yay.   The day after tomorrow at this time will find me on the road, headed to The Boy for a weekend of coffee, hugs, DVDs, and maybe some hard core partying.  Good times.  Finally feels like summer's here...REALLY here, and it feels great.  Need to do some standing poses tonight.  As well as tidy up the apartment.  Have shavings from my front door on the kitchen floor to attend to, but it's worth it because of the big shiny new deadbolt installed yesterday.  I feel so secure.    The new cut is growing on me (bad pun intended).  It looks a bit different every day, which is both a good thing and kinda disappointing when I can't get it back to how it looked that one day when it was almost hot.

      So, it's 10, a good 12 hours since I arose and tried not too hard to get to the study session on time.  Rounded out the Pleadings flashcards around 930 and paused enjoy some fresh brownies and Dreyers Andes Mint Ice Cream; somehow, we can't seem to get going again.    Got scared around 3.  The exam was less than 24 hours away and I still didn't have a handle on joinder, despite the intense study of the subject yesterday.  Granted, I had other things on my mind (like the significantly reduced amount of hair on it), but still.  A wasted day never feels good, especially the day following it, particularly when that day is the one before an exam.    So yea, winding down...the mind is turning to mush and that's as good a reason to call it a night as any.  Soon it will be time for Torts, the grand finale.  Good thing it's only a two hour exam.  Feels like we've been in finals mode for a month.  Studying for Property is a distant memory.  We're discussing the propositioning of ourselves for the questions to the Civil Procedure exam.  Could get interesting...

      Not bad, huh?    Blogger decided to re-vamp its look, I saw the new template on the Birthday Girl's blog and decided it was for me.  The comments of old didn't make the transition (it would have been tacky and bugged me to no end, trust me...it's better this way), but that seems to be the only sacrifice.  The links finally have their place on the side bar and there's less white space than usual.  I realize the type is small, and that might receive some attention at some point.  But not tonight.  Have GI Jane on TBS and we're quickly becoming engrossed.    Still waiting for the hair to grow out.  The EMP (in Seattle) baseball cap might be making regular appearances.    Seriously, we're talking an '80s aerobics instructor.  I should get my own video.

      is already half over, but that's okay.  My apartment is clean and I might get to read my long lost novel for a bit tonight.  Going to see "Laws of Attraction" in a few minutes with the gals; it will probably end up being a guilty pleasure, but seeing Julie be a silly lawyer is just what I need right now.    Speaking of Julie-s, I got my hair cut this morning.  Decided this winter that I would cut my hair way short for the summer.  Not too dykey, but shorter than usual.  And I decided my day off in between stressful finals and a week before the big three-day celebration in Bozeman would be the perfect time.  So, I put myself into the hands of my 50+ fag hairdresser and said: "Short and cute for summer"  and let him go.  An hour later, it was the scene out of Steel Magnolias when Julia gets her locks lopped off and makes Dolly Parton cry.  I think it will be fine, once it grows in a bit.  It fucking better.  It's not super short, but it's much shorter than I anticipated.  The back and sides are hot, I must admit, but from the front, I look like a 12 year-old boy.  Sigh.  Maybe the gals will know what to do.  And this is just a random update from  urlLink Neil's site  on the new book:   My gut suspicion at this point -- half way through it, I hope -- is that people who liked American Gods, but didn't like Stardust or Neverwhere probably won't like it, while people who liked Neverwhere but didn't care for American Gods will like it a great deal. (People who liked  Neverwhere  and  American Gods  are on their own.) I don't think it will be one of the books that wins awards, but it may be one of those things that some people love more than anything. I could be wrong about all of this, mind you. I set out to write a Thorne Smith novel, and I have no idea how close I'll actually come. My editor, Jennifer, laughed at the funny bits, and that felt good.   I loved both  American Gods  and  Neverwhere , so I guess I'm hosed.

      The major ones are done.    KICK ASSSSSSS!!!!!  Feeling soooooo good about the Contracts exam.  Came out of the exam last semester feeling confused and violated.  This semester, I was calm, confident and on top of shit.  Once I started, that is.  The morning was split between avoiding practice exams, doing one question and breakfast/lunch with Sadie.  The three hours flew by and I emerged from the building with a huge weight lifted.  Suddenly the next three exams are entirely do-able.  We seem to be taking tonight off; got the Crim Law flashcards out, looked at one, and put them back on the table.  Now we have the Friends special of Dateline going.  It's so odd that a night of TV has become a luxury.    But I'll take it.

      We're plotting the demise of the top students after having tried a Contracts practice question.    The Property exam was pretty good; think I wrote too much, but I'd rather err on that side than being too skimpy.    Contracts for the rest of the night and the whole day today.  After tomorrow, we'll be on the downhill slope.  Feels like we're in the thick of the whole process.  The build-up is finally over and we're rolling, but at the same time, there's still 4 exams left, the mother of all exams coming up tomorrow.  And then there's only 3 left.  Fuck.  Feels like it will never be over.  And yet, there's not enough time to get fully prepared.    I realize this is very fragmented and boring.  My peeps are discussing the demise of vowels and commas in their attempts at getting their outlines down to 10 pages.    How did it come to this?

      Once I'm in this room, I'm calm.  Or at least calmer.    Glanced over the (now 31 page) outline and remember that I DO know this shit.    It feels like we were just in here.  Most of us are in the same seats.  Seems like it should be snowing outside and the November mix is in my head.    I have enough room for my group's three page flowchart on Real Covenants.  Susan has an index for her 80-page outline.    Sadie forgot her disk drive, but will survive on the school's wireless system.    Wonder when the computer guys will get in here and tell us how to do this thing.    Once this exam is done, we'll be on our way and there will be no going back.    Still have 27 minutes to change my mind.

      It's Monday, close to 1030, and I'm watching Ellen.  It must be time for Finals.    I still can't quite wrap my mind around the fact that it's here.  The end.  The whole weekend felt like the beginning of summer.  Highs in the upper-70s, grilling burgers and hot dogs on Karen's back porch, watching the boys chip golf balls, much to the quails' chagrin.  If it weren't for the Property flashcards, it may as well have been the 4th of July.  And the more we did, the better I felt.  This was going to be a good exam.  Sure, no practice exams had been done, no written answers to short questions or the like, but the whiteboard examples and flowchart of greatness made up for it.  Plus, it is impossible to prepare for this professor's exam.  He's giving us a real estate contract and possible title problems, and our task is to write a title opinion addressed to an a practicing attorney who's not versed in Property law.  No pressure.    Thought I would come home from studying last night to spend some time with the Contracts study guide before returning it today.  But no.  That will happen tonight and tomorrow.  Instead, I worked more on the outline and tried to keep my mind occupied so as to not think of what Monday was bringing with it.  Did a nice round of yoga, too, and that always helps.    Chatted with the Boy for a bit and all I want to do this morning is go to Bozeman.  I want it to be the 14th.  I want it all to be over.  Part of me is still in denial about it even being finals because it should only be the beginning of April, and part of me just wants the damn things to hurry up already.  Was doing so well all weekend and now I'm nervous as all hell.  Between 5 and 7, kept waking up doing Privity of Contract and Privity of Estate analyses.  When I wasn't walking through the flow chart of Real Covenants, that is.  Can't come up with hypotheticals while studying, but I have more than enough rolling around my head at 537 the morning before the exam, half asleep.    Just have to remember to take a deep breath, go slow, one exam at a time and by the end, there will be a great celebration waiting for me at the end.

      H'ok, so...I've made reference to him many a time as one of my favorite authors and fellow-bloggers, but there's rarely been an opportunity to share exactly what makes him thus without shoving a book in someone's hands.  Such an opportunity arose, however, with a posting on his journal.  It's a speech he gave at some function at which he received an award and it encapsulates just what makes Neil Neil and why we can't get enough of him.  Yes, he's talking about comics; but I like to think he's talking about other things, too.     I'm in the middle of writing a novel currently, and unlike the pleasant social world of comics where, if you're me, you talk on a daily basis to editors and artists to letterers or colourists or cover artists, writing a novel is something that's done solo. It's just me and a lot of pieces of paper. Even my family leaves me alone to write.   This means that when finally offered the opportunity to speak, I'm liable to begin with apologising for being so out of practice, and then to start blithering unstoppably.  Forgive me if I blither.   (respectful snipping)  ****   When, as a young man, my dream of getting to make comics started to become a reality, I started to meet comics people. These were the people who I had looked up to in my teens, in my twenties, as gods upon the earth. These were the names that I conjured with. I would read everything I could about them when I was growing up, in a time when there was precious little about them to read, and even less of what they had done still in print.  And now I was to meet them.  And I discovered, to my surprise, that quite a lot of them were cranky old jews. Or wannabe cranky old jews – they seemed to be enjoying themselves too much to be properly cranky, and not all of them were actually Jewish.  And now, approaching my mid-forties, eighteen years after writing my first comic, I find myself heading down the conveyor belt towards cranky old Jewhood. I'm at the age where they start to give you lifetime achievement awards, and you rather wish they wouldn't, because it may be some kind of a hint that it's time for you to sit down and shut up.  It is the prerogative, however, of those who are one day to be cranky old jews to give advice to the generations that will follow them. And while some of you are my contemporaries, and others are my seniors, I shall advise anyway. My first piece of advice is this:  Ignore all advice.  In my experience, most interesting art gets made by people who don't know the rules, and have no idea that certain things simply aren't done: so they do them. Transgress. Break things. Have too much fun.    2) Read outside of comics. Learn from places that aren't comics. Don't do what anyone else is doing. Steal from places that people aren't looking. Go outside. Many years ago, when it was almost unheard of for foreigners to write American comics, people used to ask why British Writers were different. I had no idea. I did notice that when I spoke socially to people like Alan Moore, or to Grant Morrison, we mostly weren't talking about comics. We were talking about avant garde forms of poetry, about non-fiction writers, about weird things we'd found. Grant Morrison discovered a long-forgotten Victorian children's author named Lucy Clifford, who wound up influencing both his Doom Patrol and, much later, my Coraline. We loved comics, but they weren't all we knew. There's a whole cool world out there. Use it.  3) Read all the comics you can. Know your comics.   The history of comics is not a long one, and it's not unknowable. We can argue about whether or not hieroglyphics were the earliest comics, or the Bayeux tapestry or what. At the end of the day, we don't have a long history. You can learn it. You can, these days more easily that you ever could before, study it. And the high points of the last century in comics are quite astonishing.    (edit)   There's more classic and important material in print now in affordable editions than there has ever been. Let it inspire you. See how high people have taken the medium in the past, and resolve to take it further.  Isaac Newton, even as he created the foundations of huge swatches of science, said that if he had seen a little further than most men, it was because he was standing on the shoulders of giants.   We've inherited an art-form from giants, some of whom were cranky old Jews, and some of whom weren't Jews, and some of whom weren't even cranky.  Another piece of advice:  I've learned over the years that everything is more or less the same amount of work, so you may as well set your sights high and try and do something really cool.  There are other people around who can do the mediocre, meat-and-potatoes work that anybody can do. So let them do that. You make the art that only you can make. You tell the stories only you can tell.  As a solution to various problems you may encounter upon the way, let me suggest this:  Make Good Art.  It's very simple. But it seems to work. Life fallen apart? Make good art. True love ran off with the milkman? Make good art. Bank foreclosing? Make good art.  Keep moving, learn new skills. Enjoy yourself.   Most of the work I've done that's been highly regarded has happened in places where, when I was working on it I tended to suspect that it would go one of two ways – either I was doing something cool that, if I was lucky, people would talk about for some time, or I was doing something that people would have a particularly good laugh about, in the places where they gather to discuss the embarrassing mistakes of those who went before them.  Be proud of your mistakes. Well, proud may not be exactly the right word, but respect them, treasure them, be kind to them, learn from them.  And, more than that, and more important than that, make them.  Make mistakes. Make great mistakes, make wonderful mistakes, make glorious mistakes. Better to make a hundred mistakes than to stare at a blank piece of paper too scared to do anything wrong, too scared to do anything.  Critics will grumble. Of course they will. That's one of the functions of critics. As an artist it's your job to give them ulcers, and perhaps even something to get apoplectic about.   Most of the things I've got right over the years, I got right because I'd got them wrong first. It's how we make art.   (edit)   And if I have a prediction it's simply this: the often-predicted Death of Comics won't happen. There will be more booms and there will be more busts. Fads and fashions turn up in comics, as with all things, and, as fads and fashions always do, they end, normally in tears.  But comics is a medium, not a fad. It's an art-form, not a fashion. The novel was once so called because it was indeed something novel, but it's lasted, and I think, after a few shakedowns, the graphic novel, in whatever form, will do likewise.  Already some things are changing:  When I started writing about comics, before I ever began to write comics, I wanted a world in which comics would simply be regarded as a medium like any other, and in which we were accorded the same respect that any other medium was given. The amount of respect that novels and films and great works of art got. I wanted us to get literary awards. I wanted comics to turn up on the shelves of bookshops, and to sit next to books on the bestseller lists. Maybe one day a comic could come out and be on the NYT bestseller list.  We've got all that. And I don't think it's important after all.  Right now I actually believe that the best thing about comics may well be that it is a gutter medium. We do not know which fork to use, and we eat with our fingers. We are creators of a medium, we create art in an art-form, which is still alive, which is powerful, which can do things no other medium can do.  I don't believe that a fraction of the things that can be done with comics have yet been done.   For now, I think we've barely scratched the surface.  And I think that's exciting. I don't know where comics as a medium will go in the future. But I want to be amazed, and I'm pretty sure that I shall be.   And I trust that one day when you, whatever age, race, gender, or ethnicity you may lay claim to, are in your turn a cranky old Jew up here giving a speech, that that will always remain true.

      And the Seattle weather that wasn't there when we were followed us home.  Even though I miss the good ol' house-rocking T-storms of Poky, Moscow definitely has the apocalyptic-cloud-thing going.  The wind's picking up as the day turns dark and I hope I'll get through this post in one piece.  Just heating up the remainder of the Boy's impromptu Vegetable-Beef-soup-turned-Pasta-Stew and surveying the too-empty apartment.  Should balance the checkbook, put the extra blankets and pillows away, finish arranging the new wall decorations and vacuum.  But I won't.  Have just enough energy to eat dinner, put on some new mixes, burn a thank-you CD for our lovely hosts, tell the story of the weekend and call it a night.    So the Boy and I have reached the point where we know what we want to do, where we want to go, etc. in our city.  Every visit feels less like a vacation and more like a return to something very familiar and deeply missed.  The transition time between the initial gasps of child-like wonder and squeals of "We're  here !" and easing into the city we hope to one day call home is growing shorter.    Thus, we spent the first evening reconnecting.  At first with the skyline, skinny sidestreets and Broadway; later with old friends, even though it was a first meeting for some of us and a much-overdue reunion for others.   urlLink The General  (Laura) and her  urlLink Boy  (Brandon) met us for remnants of our Thai food and  urlLink the soon-to-be Driver  (Jen) followed soon after.  The Boy and I were looking forward to kicking off the festivities with a few laid back beers at the Wild Rose, the dykiest bar west of the Cascades.  But the $8 cover charge changed things and our group headed back down Pike street to the sleek, chic Manray (read: opposite of the Rose).  We found wall-to-wall well-dressed fags and the long-lost gay thump and it felt like coming home.  We bonded over too many drinks, unattainable but hopeful goals (four-somes, being forced to turn down three numbers because of the winner in the back pocket, etc.) for the next three days and fondling strangers.   urlLink Just Jack in the Big Easy  even stopped by for a few minutes.  It felt like old times at Shermer's with the Argonaut crew, only this time we were older, wiser, hotter, gayer and on top of our respective games.  And we had the entire weekend (not to mention the rest of our lives) ahead of us.  The Boy and I were left to our own devices Friday and we had new sights to see.  First stop was the new branch of the  urlLink Seattle Public Library .  We watched in awe last summer as the skeleton emerged from the mess of steel and insulation.  We stood speechless this summer inside looking out on the gorgeous, clear summer day shining in through the ceilings and walls, drooling over the slanted stacks with rubber call numbers on the floor, imagining taking Sunday worship in its reading rooms.    Such a temple could only be followed by the Elliot Bay Bookstore, a staple we've somehow managed to overlook until this trip.  It's the omega of independently-owned bookstores, something Seattle manages to do well without trying.  It lived up to the hype, with its hardwood floors, walls, and shelves, unending levels, rooms and rows of books, and incredibly eclectic selection.  Leaving emptyhanded felt dirty and wrong, but I was not about to force finding the trip's signature book.  Levi found more than enough loot, on the other hand, bringing his total for his trip into the double-digits.  Took a rest on the pier and wished it could be 3 p.m. Friday forever.    Stopped by our favorite comics store in Pike's Market before heading back to the hotel to prepare for the big night ahead.  A lazy drive back to Capitol Hill and a stop by the Pussy Bookstore later found us at the Broadway Grill for dinner where new big stories were told and old ones were remembered.  Wanted to give the Rose another chance, but the $2 increase in cover charge killed that idea.    Made it to R Place just in time to escape its $4 cover (suck on that, lezzies!) and began drinking what became a river of vodka while catching up on our gay dance fave videos before heading upstairs to the dancefloor.  It's a good thing we had a Vanilla (vodka) Coke and two Vodka Tonics in us each, as they were the only things keeping us going while the DJ played hip hop after rap after R&B song.  Not that there's anything wrong with that type of music, but we came for the cheezy, light, peppy, downright GAY music!  All we're asking for is some Madonna, people; maybe some Pink and No Doubt on the side, Kylie, Bonnie Tyler, ABBA, something.  And what the fuck is the deal with last call at 120 on Pride Friday?  I'm seriously, you guys.  But the greasy pepperoni pizza from the closet across the street made up for the night's shortcomings.  Oh, and scoring an empty Absolut bottle from a Dumpster on the way back to Harley.  Hmm...still need to get that out of my car.  Started Saturday with coffee and donuts before meeting the party-planning crew for lunch at their favorite Asian-cuisine establishment.  The curry was divine and we swapped Mom Stories as the Immaculate Collection made its second pass on 'repeat'.  The fivesome decided to split up for the rest of the afternoon, but made arrangements for gay bingo and a barbershop opening later.  Levi and I made it to our last favorite bookstore, where I finally cleaned up...scoring not one but three books to commemorate the occasion.  YAY (times three)! As the coffee shop next door (where God was last spotted) met its demise in our absence, we made do with a new favorite for our routine fondling and petting of the new acquisitions.    Gay Bingo was tossed over for pizza and Trivial Pursuit, which ended in a stale-mate between the genders.  Meeting Wyatt at the Barber opening later completed the Argonaut circle and I couldn't help remembering the pained look on his face as he tried to swallow his first shot as he stood before me, shmoozing away and drinking like a hot gay fish.    There's just something about sitting on an open patio at the corner of Denny and Bellevue with a perfect gang of favorite people, watching the sun set over the Pacific, telling stories of the hottest and most interesting sex we've had (not necessarily at the same time), with the waxing moon watching over us and the skyline that makes a girl smile.  The night proceeded back to R Place where the music was the same and the patrons were still smashed.    Managed to make it to the girls' place the next morning for the infamous pre-Pride Parade party and ditched it in time to see the roaring Dykes on Bikes who kicked off said parade.  Some of the novelty and much of the free shit (beads, cool stickers, etc.) had evaporated in the time between this and our first parade, but I still got misty when the PLFAG parents walked by.  And there's something to be said for getting a sunburn in Seattle.    The rest of the afternoon found me watching the clock, partly because I knew the longer we stayed meant the later we'd arrive back in Moscow and mostly because I kept hoping it would say something other than it was time to go.  But the day finally got away from us all and before our three hosts collapsed for the afternoon, they saw us off in our bargain parking lot.  Leaving the city gets more difficult every time.  The pouting and chest tightening starts earlier.  The "I hate when things are over/I always cry at endings" feeling sinks deeper.  And then there's the trying to get out of the damn place.  For two years in a row now, it hasn't let us go without a fight, as though we have the strength to pull away.  This time, I-5 thought it would be fun to hide from us.    Took about half an hour on the road to realize there would be no return to work Monday and the day off was the perfect ending to the adventure.  We spent it on the futon with books and conversation, at the Grind with books and more conversation, and on the futon again with AbFab and Scarlet.  The return to reality was hard, but playing the new mixes helped tremendously, as did a yoga session of long-lost stretches.  Hadn't done any poses since Friday night in the back end of the Pussy Bookstore and tonight marks the one-year anniversary of my first class.  Good times.    Now sleep is calling and I don't want to pull myself away from the memories of the last few days.  Maybe I'll bring my new books to bed with me like I used to do with Curious George and Sesame Street.

      We're back.  We're waving.  And we're not leaving the apartment, except for developing the film, visiting the Grind and maybe a lunch or dinner with Jane (you wanna?).  But the Boy put it best on his blog and it's been a while since I've stolen shamelessly from him, so here we go:   The huge summer adventure is approaching its conclusion. Two weeks full of insight and unexpected meetings, resolved conflicts, new beginnings, followed by the climactic Pride weekend in seattle with the gorgeous gay Idaho crew; it's a lot to digest.   Now we're at the part of the story where the heroes have achieved their mission, changed forever, and have only to complete the journey home to carry out the lessons they've learned. It's the bittersweet section, where you don't want it to end, but you know it can't go on; the part where you realize soon you'll have to deal with the dishes and laundry again. This is the point in every vacation where I wish more than anything that I had one more day...just one!  So that's what we've decided, the Girl and I. Leaving Seattle at 5 put us in Moscow at 10. She wasn't going to be any good at work on Monday. I would barely be able to move, let alone drive another 7 hours to Bozeman. So why even try? Why not just give ourselves what we both want and deserve: one more day of lounging, recovering, and recharging from our fantastic weekend of gay excess.  It really is the only thing to do, when you think about it. So we sleep in, make coffee, fondle the pile of new books we feel dirty for buying, and catch up on our AbFab. Nice way to wrap it all up, if you ask me.  As for the thrilling adventures, exotic new people, and dangerous car chases...it's coming. Just give me a few days to sort it all out.    Yeah.  Ditto.

       urlLink Class actions  rock.  Especially the huge, history-making types.  Quick!  Who can name the three requirements for class action classification?  THEN, for 100 bonus points, which type of Rule 23 class action suit does this one fall under?  (without looking, mind you.)

      Most of the important scenes from Saturday night have already been recounted here, but what's missing is the context.  Even though I made it a point to come out to the parents, it was never on the agenda for the grandparents.  The reasons are pretty obvious, but chief among them are: they're from a different generation who wouldn't be, how you say, understanding? tolerant? kind for the sake of appearances? It's all I would be to them; everything else about me aside, I would for all time be The Gay.  And as much as I want my last few years with them to be spent in that space, I don't.  It's basically the same reason I didn't come out to my parents until I moved out.  I knew the last year under the same roof would be consumed by the Gay Curse, a struggle they weren't going to win and I was unwilling to put us all through.  So, because of that decision, I never felt the need to tell any of my extended family because word spreads like wildfire in this family.  Especially this kind of news about one of the two Golden Children.  Also, the parents have such a time with it themselves that to have anyone else in the family know could put them in the awkward position of discussing it with people they know are sizing them and their kids up, something I've always tried to save them from, even though I know it's not my responsibility.    But as we've all grown up and become adults, where the 10-year difference in age means less than it did when I was 14, I've found myself wanting to be friends with some of the cousins.  We've shared bottles of Captain Morgan.  I talked with Michel (the hot husband) for many drunken hours the evening we first met and the next year he made me promise to read the Lord of the Rings...something not even Levi could manage.  Teressa (the bride) and I sat in the corner of Heather's wedding shower two years ago, having never really known her my entire life, cackling, poking fun and relating to each other in a way I've never felt with another family member.  Trish (the wonderful wife) has always been a favorite among my immediate family and she's been opening up more and more during the last few months about her frustration with her in-laws.  And so, I was looking forward to the after wedding wedding party Saturday night with all of these people.  At last, we would be free to be ourselves without hiding in the back or running after the kids when they whine or turn blue.  And part of me wished The Subject would come up, if only to share something with these folks I wanted to be more than just related to.    But I didn't want it coming up at the wedding itself, so I decided against the cropped pants that went with the outfit I planned to wear for the occasion.  Figured I could throw 'em on afterward and the tattoo riding a half-inch below the fabric would go unnoticed...or at least un-commented-on.    My eyes must have dropped onto the table when Rob blurted out:  "Andrea, do you have a tattoo?" at his sister's (Heather) monstrosity of a new house, with my mom to my left.    "Yes," I answered out of my tight lips, one foot covering up the other ankle.  "How long have you had that?" he persisted.  "Since I was 18."    Now DROP IT!!  my tone said.  "You have a tattoo?" Trish asked from across the room.  And somewhere, thankfully, the subject was shifted and all I wanted to do was change out of these damn pants, but made do with holding said ankle in my hand.  Later, the folks and I made an appearance at Bride's parents' barbecue.  As I made my way out front to wait for the ride to the piano bar downtown, Aunt Becky (Rob and Heather's mother) asked: "Is that a tattoo around your ankle?" (Starting to see the connections?)  "Yup," I said, not seeing the connections, just thinking it really  is  that noticeable when it's not covered.  "I haven't seen that before, how long have you had that?"  "Since I was 18."  "The colors are so pretty."  "Yea, I like 'em."  Finally in the van on the way to the evening's plans, I felt more out of place than I have in a long time.  Surrounded by 35-ish people who have just bought brand new homes, are starting families without a hair out of place just didn't make me feel like me.    But a few laughs, drinks and raucous songs later, things were looking up.  And when Michel "innocently" brought up a woman's (the one our table had been making fun of for the last 4 songs because she wouldn't get off the stage) tattoo, I was ready to have this out.  So, he became the first.  He asked when I knew, how the parents and Joe were, if there was Anybody; said he was proud of me; told me everyone already knew (although I never got around to asking who 'everybody' is); joked about it in the way we love; promised to be discrete.    Just as I was learning to breathe again, Rob called me over to his end of the table, asked about the symbolism, apologized for earlier, reassured and hugged me in a way he never has before.    Trish interrupted to ask "What are you two talking about?" and told me I'd be joining her for a smoke outside.   Sure, what the hell?   It started with "So what were you talking to Rob about?" and quickly became a ranting session about her in-laws.  30 minutes in, she let out a long breath and said: "I'm sooo glad you're here."  "Really?  I always feel like the little kid."  "NO!  Don't feel like that.  I love your family!  You guys are so real!"  And before long, I was struck by the fact that here I was again, being the listening, reassuring one, bonding with someone over  her  troubles, when the whole purpose for our time together was for the opposite.    She seemed to realize this all of a sudden, saddled her body up next to mine and said: "So, what's going on with  you ?" with a smile that told me she knew exactly what my answer would be.  "Oh, I think you already know."  She just looked at me for a second before saying: "Why are you so quiet about it?"  Cue update on the Parent Situation.  She never skipped a beat and was nothing but the calm, sweet, wonderful woman I've loved since we met, even though she was incredibly drunk and more loose than I'd ever seen her...which actually just made me like her all the more.  "Is it just your parents?"  "Well, no...it's the grandparents, too..."  "I KNEW IT!!!"   "Yea, that one's not hard to figure out."  "If it were me, I wouldn't be so quiet..but then, I'm a rebel." which she's totally not, but okay, we'll go with that for the moment.  "It's all I would be to them.  If I had someone, that would be a different story..."  "You would say something then?"  "Absolutely; if I had someone I wanted to bring home..."  "Okay, good."  "But I don't.  And there's no reason for me to be out and proud for the sake of it when 'that' would consume the last years I have with them."  "Yea..that's true."  "Hey you two!  The party's  inside !!"  Teressa said as she burst through the doors.    The three of us went on a hunt for more cigarettes and nary another word was spoken about the issue.  Rob and Trish walked me to the hotel an hour later and I re-lived the evening all night in my half-dreams.    The drive home was consumed by my hangover, the intense sensitivity that accompanies said hangovers, the enormity of the evening before and knowing I had to tell the parents the cousins knew, no matter what they would say.  It could have been anything, really.  From Mom's patented "You will be the death of me, child" sigh, to outrage, to anxiety and "What are we supposed to do/say NOW?  I'm sure the whole family knows!!!"  But anything would be better than hearing "Guess what Becky said to me..."  And so, I ended up having the best conversation about the whole thing Mom and I have ever had.  Spent the night on the futon, curled up with a stress-victim stomach, talking with Miss Viscious, attaching words to what the last few weeks have said loud and clear.    The haze of the whole thing has lifted slowly over the course of the day, not coincidentally along the same timeline as the release of this month's hormones.  At least I know I won't have to worry about getting pregnant at Pride.    As the nerves calm, and the raw, exposed sensation fades, I'm left feeling stronger, closer to my family and shaking my head at the band of color around my left ankle.

      It all began innocently enough.  I was going to the Emerald Club for the first time.  Ever.  It's been the scene of many a fabled story for years and I finally had enough I don't know what to leave Mom in the hotel room at 10 and make my way to the drinking establishment alone, looking for a story and maybe a familiar face.  As I walked in, I quickly scanned the faces for one I recognized.  When I found none, I wanted to leave; but, I wanted to go back to the room even less.  The thing is, this place has always been described as this hip-happenin' dance club where all the young things go to be their gay-fabulous-selves.  It's actually just a step up from Charley's.  It reminded me a bit of  urlLink Woody's , though, and that kept me from gulping my Heffy and bolting.   People watching is one of my favorite past-times.  Folks started trickling in around 1030, which kept my attention busy between watching the door, bartender, regulars and the pool game happening over my shoulder.  After such a sweep over the premises and reach back for my beer, I noticed a missed call on the cell phone.    "Viscious' Cell"  How appropriate.  The weekend she knows I'm out of town on assignment with the family and immediately after I've posted my "It's over (even though it never began) and I'm okay with that" entry.  I celebrated the absolute lack of desire, will, pull, etc. to return the call with a swig and gaze at the slop-shot happening to my right.    But I knew I'd have to listen to the message.  Just wanted to let me know she's alive, that her hibernation had nothing to do with me and she wants to talk to me about the conclusions she's reached in her self-imposed isolation.  Deciding I was having too good a time at my post and too close to talking to the girl who reminded me too much of another crush, I left the bathroom knowing V. would wait until Sunday to tell me (or hear) what I've known for a month.  Before long, I was recruited to join the pool party and couldn't help but think of how proud the Boy would be of me for being so social and charming.  I followed Chip (honest to god, that's the woman's name), the center of the group, to the table where I met her pregnant wife, Jen (aka Stands with Arms Folded), their friend (the one who reminds me of a young library worker of old), Christine, and the father of their child, Monte.  Away the next two hours flew with game after game and the arrival of more of my hosts' friends.  It was so nice to play with amateurs again, make impossible shots without trying, winning close games and laughing with faggy strangers.  Small talk was surprisingly easy and comfortable.  The more I was around this gang, the more I realized I could have become the newest member, if only I lived in town.  But for the moment, they cooed over my use of "concur" and "innocuous" and Yay-ed my bank shots.    By 1230, Chip turned to me from a conversation with her spent wife and said, "You up for some pork fried rice?"  "Absolutely."  Rode over with Monte in his big Cadillac and loved that I told Mom I'd be back by midnight.  Once we congregated at the Twin Dragon, the ladies chastised me about getting into a car with a stranger and Emmett...I mean, Monte joined in:  "I couldn't believe she got in just like that!  But I thought I better not say anything about it while we drove around."  Seriously, the guy is big and smart like  urlLink Ben , has  urlLink Emmett's  voice, mannerisms and stunningly sharp wit, and  urlLink Michael's  adorable "I'm going to be a Dad" thing.    "Really," Chip got serious.  "It's great that you're so trusting, but..."  "You guys, if I'd had any inkling that it wasn't absolutely okay, I wouldn't have come with you.  Honestly.  Besides, I had my cell phone. I could have snuck a call to 911 if it came to that."  "Good call," my peeps for a night agreed.  "So, what are we all getting?"  And so, while we passed around pork and seeds, fried rice and pot-stickers, I listened to Chip rattle off the common sayings she's writing about for an English class (since she's been with Jen, she's cleaning up her act) and watched Monte's eyes dance as he told the stories behind many of them.    "Water-logged" really does originate from logging operations on rivers.  "Stealing from Peter to pay Paul" is a British cathedral thing.  We laughed about Chip's germ-phobia and how, as a result, Stands With Arms Folded gets hosed when it comes to oral sex.    Gave the ladies equal time by letting them drive me to the hotel.  "I'm glad you played pool with us." Chip said.  "I'm glad you asked me."  "I hung out at bars by myself when I lived in California and it was really hard, so I try to include people I see..."  "That's really great of you, but I honestly expected to people-watch for a couple of hours."  "I commend you for that...it's really brave."  "But I'm still glad you invited me to play with you."  Ended up getting her business card out of the deal (she's a real estate agent).  Not to mention a few great memories and a lot of story fodder.  And thus concludes the first leg of the weekend.  I thought it would be the one gay night of the trip and the ultimate opening act for Pride.  We'll get to the business of proving me wrong on both counts after I've had some chicken noodle soup.

      Guess this is what you get when you win a huge lawsuit against the CD industry...payback.     urlLink "We've been wondering if we're going to get 12,000 Yanni CDs," said Wallace Hoffsis, director of collections development for the Sacramento (Calif.) Public Library.   And I  will  get around to posting the novel about the weekend, I promise.

      I have no energy to tell this story the way it should be told, but I can't let an evening pass without  something  written about it, either.  Just got home from the big wedding weekend and each day had its own wonders and terrors.  Here's a brief sampling of the trip:  Friday night:  Maiden trip to the Emerald Club where I people-watched, accidentally avoided a fateful phone call, met three dykes and Emmett from QAF (actually, he's like 78% Emmett, 17% Ben and 5% Michael).    Saturday:  wedding was beautiful; cousin Rob asked about my tattoo back at his sister's place, where I immediately clammed up and shot him "Shut the fuck up" vibes; Aunt Becky (his mother) suddenly noticed the very same tattoo a matter of hours later; cut to few more hours later and a vanilla-rum-and-coke-induced conversation with cousin Heather's (Rob's sister) hot husband Michel:    "You have a tattoo?"  "Yes, I do."  "Can I see it?"  ......  "How's  that  going for you?"  "Everybody knows, don't they?"  ....  "Well....yea.  How are your parents with it?"  "They struggle, but they're okay."  Cue huge hug.  "I think you're very brave and I'm proud of you."  Cut to Cousin Rob:  "Does your tattoo have a symbolic meaning?"  Long pause.   Will this never end??   "You can just say 'yes'."  "Yes."  "I didn't mean to embarrass you at the house earlier..."  "I know, Rob."  "You don't have to worry about us."  Cue another huge hug.  Cut to Rob's wonderful wife Trish:  "Come outside and smoke with me..."   Okay, so...long story short...the cousins know.    Cut to 20 minutes and a nervous breakdown ago:  "Quite a weekend." Mom said when I called to let her know I'd returned safely.  "Yup.  Feeling pretty zapped."  "Party!"  "Speaking of that....the cousins know."  "Oh."  "They asked and I had to tell them."  "Okay."  "I thought about it all the way home and decided it would be better for you to hear it from me than be blindsided by it."  "I'm not worried...if it comes up, it comes up."  "I didn't plan for it to happen this way, and I didn't mean to instigate anything..."  "I know you didn't.  And really, I thought you were being paranoid about wearing long pants to the wedding, but when people kept bringing it up afterward....I think it's been discussed..."  "It has been, and I think this was their way of saying 'We know and it's okay'."  "I think so too.  So don't lose sleep over it.  Hopefully no one will say anything to Grandma and Grandpa.  But if they do, we'll just deal with it and it'll be okay.  I know what to say if anyone says anything to be about it.  It doesn't change who you are, we still love you, we're still proud of you, you're still doing great things, we're just going to deal with it because there's no other choice."  Cue crying session number infinity.  "You didn't think I was this far along, did you?"  "I knew you'd get there eventually, I just didn't know when eventually would come."  "Well, I am.  All that worrying for nothing..."  "I don't know what to say."    And I still don't.  So I'm going to take a shower, have some dinner, and process the last three days before I sit down to write the whole story (oh yes, there's more...).  Stay tuned.

      Had an odd but great dream last night.  Don't know where I was, exactly, but I suddenly found myself walking by the office of the Aspen Publishing company.  They're big on law textbooks and "study aids".  They're the only publisher who does 1st-year-subject flashcards and those are pretty hit or miss.  Typos, answers to questions never asked in the fact-patterns and flat-out wrong black-letter law cards.  So, whenever The Stellar Super Students got hosed on an answer we KNEW was right, we took great joy in dismissing the card with the obligatory "Fuck Aspen!" attached.    So, as I found myself so close to the puppet-masters behind the travesty, I was compelled to share my frustration.  Walked in to an empty office space that closely resembled an overdone ski lodge.  High ceilings, too much decorative wood, etc.  Kinda like The Stranger's office.  Nosed around until I found three gals in tank tops, jeans and tool belts (I'm seriously, you guys) working on more decorative wood, only in here, it was 2x4s.  Knew in an instant they were all "family" and one, the leader, took my breath away the instant our eyes met.    But I would not be deterred.    I walked right into that room and declared:  "Fuck Aspen!"  No introduction; no "May I talk to your flashcard department?"; nothing.  They were a bit surprised, but let me go on.  I explained (and by 'explained', I mean 'ranted incessantly about') the problems with said flashcards while they listened attentively.  Finally, as I said my peace and made my way to leave (because really, how was I going to transition well out of that?), all three spoke up at once: "No! Stay!  We like you!  You wanna help us revise those?"  And so on.  I was instantly a member of the group and before long, we made our way to the kitchen.  Yes, there was a kitchen in the office..whatev.  All the while, nothing was really said between me and the hottest of the three worker-lesbians, but there was definitely some vibes exchanged.  As the other two and I shared some Better Than Sex chocolate cake and laughed like old friends, She came up behind me, wrapped her arms around my waist and I woke up.  What do you think it  means ??

      No Intro classes to be found after 645 am.  Fine.  I'll just take my handy-dandy refund and release all those I tried not-so-hard to convince to try out the body-bending experience.  Won't be as sculpted, but at least there's a bit more padding in the bank account.  Sweeeet.

      H'ok, so...have 16 yoga classes to cram into 9 days.  7 of those are make-ups for the Seattle and July vacations.  The remaining ones are just regularly scheduled classes.  Yay.  So, until July 1, I'll have a yoga class every night, and sometimes two.    I'm going to be so damn toned, it won't even be funny.

      Your mom's got nothing on mine!!  For all the stress and trauma she causes me, my mom kicks ass.  Really.  One of the things I dig about her is her inability to go simple, small, understated.    When it appeared I needed a new dresser, bed-side tables, etc. in junior high, she decided I needed a full bedroom set of the finest quality, you know, to have when I move out and get my own house.    When I got my apartment, I planned to fill it with cheap, tacky furniture I could throw away at the end of my tenure, and shopped accordingly before the parents arrived to help in the venture.  By the time they left, I had a brand new table, futon and desk, because really, this was to be my home for (at least) the next two years.    When I asked for a DVD player for Christmas a couple of years ago, she decided I needed a 5-disc changer with 5 speakers and a subwoofer, you know, to have when I get my own house.  She stresses about vacations especially well.  Take an email conversation from this morning:  From: Cheryl    Sent:  Wednesday, June 16, 2004 9:07 am  To:  Andrea  Subject:  How does Mexico sound?   I just don't know what to think about Orlando....too hot and too long of lines.  How does Mexico sound?  From:   Andrea   Sent:  Wednesday, June 16, 2004 9:09 am  To:  Cheryl    Subject:  Re: How does Mexico sound?   WOOOOO HOOOOOOO!!!!!  (it sounds okay) :-)  From:  Cheryl  Sent:  Wednesday, June 16, 2004 9:11 am  To:  Andrea Subject: Re: How does Mexico sound?   Does that sound better to you?   From:   Andrea   Sent:  Wednesday, June 16, 2004 9:14 am  To:  Cheryl  Subject:  Re: How does Mexico sound?   either one would be fine, really...i'm okay with whatever, but Mexico sounds really good...as long as i don't have to see any actual Mexicans, that is.   From:   Cheryl    Sent:  Wednesday, June 16, 2004 9:17 am  To:  Andrea Subject:  Re: How does Mexico sound?   A bus load of mexicans is almost as bad as a bus full of asians it's true!    Sigh...could I love her more?

      Just finishing the "writing" stage of burning the new mix.  It's so exciting!  This is the first mix I've constructed all by myself since last year's October Mix.  I realized, after a few listens, that I may want to start listening to the track list a few times, tinkering with songs and such before actually calling it good.  Never was one who came by revisions naturally.  And so, for months, I resigned myself to the fact that I'm not a good mixer.  Decided to leave that to The Boy and just help with brainstorming possibilities.    But, as promised, that not-too-forgotten pang of creation, the one that's been rolling around in the back of my mind for over a month, finally took hold; just not in the form I was expecting.    But hey, I'll take it.  And now, it's in Sam on its maiden playing.  iTunes doesn't mess around, I tell ya what!  3 minutes, tops.  Jeez!    Madge's "Intervention" didn't make the cut, even though I was dead-set on it yesterday.  But as Stephen King once wrote, we sometimes have to kill our favorite babies for the sake of greatness.  It still doesn't have a title, which is a bit odd, but don't think it'll stay that way for long.  Any suggestions?

      So it's probably just payback for last week's Harry Potter debacle, but I'm really not understanding all the flack "The Stepford Wives" has received.  I thought it was great.  Sure, there were flaws: it could have been darker; it could have been sharper; Matthew Broderick could have been left out.  But over all, it was pretty damn good.  Maybe it's because I have yet to see the original and didn't have any of those nasty expectations going in, other than how much I knew I'd love it.  The critics seem to be so mad about its campiness and superficiality.  I'm sorry, but I thought that was the whole point.  Camp works.  Okay, so it's not a probing, hard-hitting social commentary/satire.  But there are some great fucking lines and Glenn Close is phenomenal as the perfect evil bitch.  The story's a bit weak, but the trio of Nicole, Bette and the gay boy make me want to move to Stepford and join their anti-cult.  I'm sure I'll hate it the second time I see it, but for now, I'm left coveting Nicole's great hair.  Sigh, soon.    In other news...  It's been a long-standing joke/theme/infuriatingly perfect/creepy thing that the Boy and I share parallel experiences.  Always have.  Even way back when we didn't even realize it.  It's not that the exact same thing happens to each of us at the exact same time, or that circumstances that plague one inevitably plague the other.  It's more about the more-than-a-crush we each had on our best friends in 9th grade; both loving the person for all the wrong reasons and hating them because we loved them and having no idea we were loving them.  It's the hugely epic first loves experienced across an impassable distance.  It's the knowing each respective relationship would end and knowing we would be the ones to end it.  It's the revolving obsessions.    Our timing is improving.  We've been sharing similar experiences in closer proximity, which is great for girl-talk value and for being available when one needs to hear what s/he just told the other not more than two weeks ago.  And so, when a new boy came into The Boy's life and showed promise, a part of me rejoiced for my own chances with this new girl I'd been hearing so much about.  When it appeared his promise would not be fulfilled, a part of me got worried.    And sure enough, my story shares the same highs, lows and ending.  Granted, the plot points wore different clothing, but underneath, they're the same.  To the letter.  There's not much to tell by way of details, which is basically the whole point.  There's nothing to tell because there's nothing to tell.  Nothing's happened; nothing's moved anywhere.  And while it hurt in the beginning, the wanting to find out what happens next, to become friends and see where it took us only to be met with silence or promises for later, it doesn't hurt anymore.  We haven't talked about anything; nothing's been resolved (or brought up, for that matter); we're no closer to becoming friends than we were a month ago.  Nothing's ended because it never began.  But none of it bothers me anymore.  I did my part.  I gave it a try and kept up my end as best I could.  There's nothing to regret, really, because nothing ever got to that point.  The whole "in different places" thing, while known from the beginning, becomes more and more apparent with every passing week, and it's time to put the whole thing on the shelf of good memories.    So, the Boy and I find ourselves yet again in the same place.  At the end of another short story, ready to find the first line of the next great tale.  Seattle seems like a good place to go looking.

      So now when Mom asks me, as she's been doing every once in a while for 6 months, I can say I've tried it and it's good, just like the package says.  It's not the same as the original, from the box, cooked on the stove Mac & Cheese, but it'll do on Sunday afternoon spent at the office.    Just compensating for this Friday's absence, which will be spent in Boise celebrating the semester's victories with Mom before the big wedding on Saturday.  Should be quite the event.  Have a cousin's new baby to ohh and ahh over; have another cousin's new pregnancy to pretend to be excited about; Grandma and Grandpa will be missing on account of the latter's recent open-heart surgery; and the after-wedding party with the newlyweds at a dueling piano bar.  Score.    So yea, just me in the big ol' empty office.  Brought my laptop along so I could download the iTunes program using the school's wi-fi.  Decided yesterday that I wanted a new Summer Mix.  Something other than the fabulously brand new Mixes the Boy is cooking up.  This will be a retrospective: Summer's Greatest Hits.  There's some hugely guilty pleasures, some classics, some new faves and some long-forgotten yet greatly beloved archetypes.  Accordingly, some songs had to be hunted down on the internet and (sigh) paid for.  Can't wait to get home, put it together and give it its first listen doing some long-overdue yoga.    After watching Game 4, that is.  Go Pistons.

      I kick ass.  Now, before I post this, it should be noted that I'm not doing so in order to gloat or rub anything in anyone's face.  It's just that I'm really quite excited about the news and have to share the excitement.  Yay.    The law school released the class standings this afternoon, and here's where this gal fell.  We'll start with a bit of backstory, as usual:  Fall Semester GPA: 2.83 Fall Semester standing: 41/98 Fall Semester section standing: 21/48  Now let's get to the best fucking news ever:  Spring Semester GPA: 3.45 Spring Semester Standing: 5/98 (the whole class) Spring Semester Section Standing: 4/48 (just my section [half the class])  And move to the big picture:  Cumulative GPA: 3.19 Cumulative Standing: 18/98 Cumulative Section Standing: 8/48   Sigh.  I still can't quite believe it, but I also can't seem to get this grin off my face.  Nice way to kick off the weekend.

      There's an ass-crack on the cover of Food Processing.    "What's Food Processing?" you ask?  It's a small-scale monthly publication that only librarians and lonely scientists see.  It's not sexy.  It's not flashy.  It probably has a print run of 5000.  There's no need for sex appeal.  Really.    The cover image is actually kind of clever.  It's a woman (of course) holding celery behind her back to catch the salt she's throwing over her shoulder and the article it references has to do with "sodium sinners."  Okay.  That's fine.  But why does she have to be naked from the ass up?  Her pants are half-way down her ass, for that matter.    My boss was half-way across the room when she stopped, did an about-face and came back to inspect the cover.  We were thoroughly outraged.  Then Cort, the resident geezer, stopped by and I thrust the magazine into his hand and said, "Look at how NOT appropriate this cover is!"  He looked over it carefully and said:  "What's wrong with celery?"

      I love blogging.  And I really love having nothing to blog about, and then something great happens and suddenly, there's a perfect story for a blog.    Case in point:  The library Office Goddess is one of the best parts of working here.  She's head secretary to the Dean and holder of the key to the supply room.  She's from Texas and has the best drawl I've ever heard and the dry, no-nonsense, shit-kicker sense of humor to match.  She's larger than life.  Literally.    She approached me from behind a few minutes ago as I carefully double-checked the 2004 invoice line item by line item, tapping my shoulder with a packet of Post-its.    "Can I trade a coffee filter for this stack of Menopause Purple Post-its?"  I looked, and sure enough, she held a stack of wonderfully lavender-hued (insert clever description of Post-its without using Post-its again here).  "Menopause purple?"  I said around my guffaw.  "Both my husband's and my mothers painted their rooms this color when they got older, so we call it Menopause Purple."  "It's also Lesbian Pride Purple.  Now, I don't actually have jurisdiction over the coffee filters, but I say go ahead."  I said as she went rummaging through the nearby drawers for said filter.  "You know, Mary Jane, your stunning outfit kinda matches this color."  "I know, I'm starting to like that color and it's worrying me."    "Could be a good barometer..."  (cut to insignificant, continuity-ruining story about a lesbian cousin)  "Did SHE paint her room this color?"   "No, I don't think she painted anything."  "Not much of a lesbian, then."  "Well, she was in Eastern Texas, she probably didn't know how to be one."  (cut to Mary Jane showing off her rainbow-colored socks)  "Those are pretty fancy," I encouraged, already planning this entry.  "We all go through changes..." she said as she made her way back to her throne, two filters (cone-shaped and flat-bottom) in hand.

      Okay, this deserves a post all its own.  I knew I was starting shit with my previous post, but meant it all in good fun.  Now I realize I've ruffled some feathers I'd never intended to ruffle and should try my best to alleviate the situation as best I can.  I'm reminded of my reaction to a friend's condescending attitude toward Middle Earth and all its beloved creatures around Oscar Time and want to apologize for donning a similar attitude here.  It was only meant in fun, I promise.  Now, I must stress that I AM a fan of the Harry Potter books.  Yes, like the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, I've been proven wrong by making like the dude in Green Eggs and Ham and just giving the books a try.  They're good, quality stuff.  There's no getting around it.  And I know I'll just come to love them more as I continue to complete them.  My previous post was never meant to besmirch the HP series itself or make excuses for my new-found fandom.  I simply am seeing similarities and chose to comment on them by making reference to my previously-held beliefs.  Yes, I've been proven wrong, and on some levels, I've been proven kind of right.    So now, all I can ask is your forgiveness for shitting on something sacred.  Send me to the Forbidden Forest.  Give me an extra Potions assignment.  But please, don't let this incident of thoughtlessness and "your world, my world" observations destroy what could become a moment of learning and...hopefully, winning.

      Okay, I just have to say...I broke down and started reading the Harry Potter books this summer.  They've been perfect for the occasion.  Yes, I resisted as long as I could because I thought Ms. Rowling was a shameless hack of an author who pieced together her story using the best bits of all the great classic epics of our time.  I was determined to resist the furor and hype with every dignified elitist bone in my body.  I was Eric Cartman in the Lord of the Rings episode where the boys are traipsing off to return the One Video Tape to The Video Store and come across a band of fellow youngsters.  "I shall put a spell on you!" said one in a fake British accent.  "What are you kids doing?"  one of the four asked.  "We're playing Harry Potter!"  "HA!!" Eric laughed condescendingly.  "FAGS!"  But the universe saw fit to let me read the series and so I have.  And for the most part, I've been pleasantly surprised.  I'm about 200 pages into the third book and I'm finally getting invested in more than just the novelty (yes, I said novelty) of it.  But the more I read, the more I realize I was right:  she is a shameless hack.    Dobby IS Gollum.  The Dementors ARE the Ringwraiths.  Dumbledore IS Gandalf AND Obi-Wan (from the original trilogy).  But I'm still hooked.  And I still can't wait to get home and keep reading.  Stupid hacks, anyway.

      One thing I miss from southern Idaho are the thunderstorms.  I'm always reminded during Moscow summers when a small rumbling that sounds like the upstairs neighbors' dishwasher rolls over the...well, rolling hills of the Palouse.  Always wish we could have a good storm like we used to have once in a while in Poky.  The kind that woke me out of a deep slumber in my cave in the basement and shook the entire house.    Barely beat the "storm" this afternoon, walking home from work.  But the lightning, when it appears, puts on a pretty good show up here.  Remember lying awake one summer night two years ago, losing yet another battle with insomnia, watching a storm form and turn into a great light show.  Took some comfort in the knowledge that even had I gone to sleep hours before, when I went to bed, I wouldn't have slept through this.  The next morning in my American TV Genres summer school class, my professor yawned and said, "Yes, I was up last night, watching the lightening with my cats."    And this afternoon, the apartment did a slight tremble after the bright flash slashed through the dark clouds, all of which was impressive, for Moscow.  But now, three hours and a cheap movie ("Mean Girls" with Calamity Jane; we love you, Tina Fey...keep making non-SNL-character movies, please) later, the skies are clear and the hills are just a bit greener.

      When I saw the 5-day forecast early Tuesday morning over my bowl of cereal, telling us that Saturday would see 80 degree sunshine and Sunday would bring rain and a plummet to 65, I said "Goin' to Elk River Saturday" around my Honey Bunches of Oats.    The weather was ahead of schedule, proving to be absolutely gorgeous all week, with a slight drop this morning.  But I would not be deterred.  Actually, it probably worked out for the best.  80 degree heat is really not the best to be trekking up and down steep forest floors, after all, and this particular trail always surprises me with its difficulty.  But I bought provisions yesterday and was determined not to get caught huffing and puffing without any trail mix!  And so, bright and early this (late) morning, I packed up my backpack full of water jugs, snacks, Superman notebook, Harry Potter novel and down the road I went.    Outran the rainclouds just fast enough to enjoy a lovely little meander to the falls, enjoyed a full 20 minutes of warm/hot sunshine and made it through a full chapter of The Chamber of Secrets before the rain started.  Even managed to get a little Henry David action on the side, which I thought I'd share here.  It's really rough around the edges, but it works:   Hey kids!  Welcome to Elk River!  We're at the Upper Falls lookout at the moment and it looks as though the spring rains have been beneficial.  My other spot--the one I planned to spend the bulk of the time at--may well be under water, so I'm hanging out here a bit longer than I originally thought.  Brought the old automatic camera I found in the old boxes last weekend--hope the roll of film is properly loaded--can't really risk looking now can I?  Looks like the clouds I outran to get here are catching up.  Good thing I changed my top and brought along the jacket!    It's nice to be here today--just the thing to celebrate a full week of nightly yoga practices and to remember the day from last year.  Good ol' June 5th, I tell ya what!  A story just might come out of my nature wanderings by the end of the day, I just dunno!   Yea, I've been feeling that old familiar pang of creation the last little while.  It's pretty amorphous and no clear idea has taken shape just yet, but the new reading list and increased "pages" time have been helping.  But anyway, back to the day:   Alrighty, here we are at my favorite little spot.  Yes, the water has risen quite a bit.  The places Levi and I dangled our feet and talked about Queer As Folk are under water.  The sun is trying to conquer to overcast sky and it feels really good for a minute.  But then the clouds overcome it and it's a bit cooler again.  But that feels really good, too.  There's nothing like the smell of a river during the summer.  It would be a bit keener if it was warmer, but it's just right for right now.  Making do with rolling up the sleeves to get some sun on the upper-arms and shoulders.  Looks like the sun may be conducive for a bit, too.  Yay.    So glad the day is living up to the idea formed last week.  Was expecting the 75-80 degrees promised, but the mild day is much better.  So glad I brought provisions.    The birds are chatting it up now that the sun's out.  Already found a little souvenir for the day---little rock waiting on a bigger rock that fits my fingers perfectly.  This is so much fun.  Soon I'll make a little nest and read.  Looks like the cloud cover is reclaiming control.  But the skin got a bit of attention and is thankful.  Nature seems to have its own agenda for the day, so all I can do is follow it and smile.    And sure enough, an hour later, nature ushered me out of the canyon.  And all the yoga must really kicking in, in a cardiovascular kind of way, because really...this trek back to the parking lot usually kills me, and it was tough today, but not nearly as.  Yay.  We love physical fitness!  Came home to find out that Ronald Reagan was dead and that Joe and I could get new, sleek flip-phones for $15 each.    "They have the 'OK' button," he said, as though that told me anything.  "As long as they're the sleek silver ones I've been drooling over for months, I'm down." Should have it when I go to Boise in two weeks.  Yay!!  And Miss Q called, which was so nice.  She's having a fabulous time in DC, working with people who are finally of her caliber, doing the sort of progressive, social-change affecting work she's always wanted to do and starting yoga.  That's right.  YOGA, I said!  She sounds as genuinely happy and content as I've heard in too long a time.  She deserves every bit of joy that seems to be continuously heading her way.  Keep following those signs, sweetie.  They'll never let you down.    So yea, not a bad day, all in all.  Think I'll go open a Huckleberry beer, finish a book, start another and listen to the rain falling on my tree.    Summer rocks.

Found this little piece from The Boy, done on a weekend not long ago.  It reminds me of a summer three years ago, sitting in Harley on an off-ramp, watching I-90 for any sign of the car we thought was following us back from Seattle.  While he kept watch, I read comics.

      But I'm just glowing (not to be confused with gloating) about this whole grades thing.  The GPA for the semester rounded out at 3.45 (which beats ShecD's 1st semester average by .03...sucker!), bringing the cumulative GPA to 3.19.    Think it's safe to say at this point that I've been blown away, and that's a good thing.    Okay, as you were...

He must have thrown out the 50 multiple-choice questions from a non-existing class.  Wonder if half the class is joining me this round, hmmmm...)  Criminal Law:  A-  (KICK ASS ALL THE WAY TO JERSEY AND BACK!!!!!  Okay, so this was the exam we all walked out of saying 'What the FUCK was that???' 'That was a 6 hour exam crammed together in 3 hours is what that was!!!!' and so on.)  Not bad, I have to say.

      Getting better at this whole checking the monthly horoscope at the  beginning  of the month.  If this is boring for you, just read my highlighted commentary and get over it.    And so...  "No doubt about it, this will be a hard-work, high-productivity month. While other signs might not be pleased to hear this, you are different.  As usual.   Capricorns are very goal-oriented, and this month you will outdo yourself, driven to near-obsession to get things done to perfection. As a Capricorn, you like to hear that your talents and your time will be put to good use, and certainly this will be the case in June.   The new moon on June 17 will be the month's main event, for from that moment on (for two weeks) an important new project, assignment or account will almost certainly come your way.   In fact, with four planets in Gemini crowded into your solar sixth house at mid-month, it is very possible that this month you will have not one but TWO important projects on your desk, or two clients to see and please. You will be able to juggle all you need to do with rare agility.   We love agility!  Especially the rare kind!!!    You also will be obsessed with organizing things  NO WAY!  - computer files, drawers, closets - and doing so will make your work life much easier. Throwing things out will turn out to be quite therapeutic, making you feel calm and in control.   Just the way I like it.     (respectful snipping of the fitness, weight-loss program)  Romantically, you might be in for a rocky ride this month if you are married or in a close, committed relationship. Before I discuss this, keep in mind that the seventh house (where this aspect will originate) also rules business partners. In what follows, if you have a business partner or collaborator, you might be able to apply this to that person and eliminate the references I make to romance. I am not sure which close partner will be highlighted, but it seems certain one will be.   Well, as long as we have THAT clear.     The first indication of this trend I see is that your partner is about to become much needier at the very time your work will become so busy. Of course, this is not a coincidence. It appears that your partner will feel neglected and it will take all you've got to keep the balls spinning at the office and, at the same time, to soothe your partner and keep your relationship intact.  Thank god I have that rare agility with me!   Saturn is now touring your solar seventh house,  better get that underwear off my table  which often brings about a separation, but it could be one that couldn't be helped. For example, this happens when one person in the pair has to work long hours, study at night, or travel a great deal for work. It looks like this preoccupied person will be you, although I can't be sure of that - it could be your partner.  Stupid partners always mess shit up.     Saturn's position also suggests that this month you may view your partner as too conservative when it comes to taking necessary, calculated risks.  Pussy.     I feel for you, dear Capricorn. It seems obvious you will be pulled in two directions, work and your personal life.  Oh shut up!  It's all your fault, anyway!   There is another way these aspects may assert themselves.  Now you tell me.   You may be in a new relationship, stressed because your work life has become so busy that you simply can't give a new romantic interest the time it takes to cultivate it properly.  Maybe...   You may be worried that things will fizzle before you can get the relationship off the ground.  Mayyybeee.....   In this case, I think you may be worrying needlessly.  Oh fine!   Simply explain to your new partner what's going on. If your new sweetheart doesn't understand, he or she never will. In that case, you need a different type of person. But I don't think that will be the case. Think optimistic thoughts.   Go optimism, woo!   In your horoscope, part of the problem is that Mars has been orbiting close to Saturn since late May. This frustrating aspect can make your feelings fluctuate from hot to cold, sometimes within a single day.  What the fuck is that supposed to mean???   Saturn is your ruler, so clearly, you are emotionally invested in your significant other and would like to give and get support in return. Before that can happen, Mars needs to separate from Saturn. That will happen in the third week of June, when you will see an improvement.   Another equally difficult problem is that Venus will be retrograde until June 29. Venus is the natural ruler of your solar fifth house of true love, and retrograde planets can bring on a change of mind, or some confusion - in this case, in matters of the heart. Luckily, all will straighten out at month's end.   Let's substitute that for  'all will be figured out at month's end' , shall we?    A special day should be Saturday, June 12. The moon will move through Taurus, a great spot for you, and Venus will wink at Neptune, which is as romantic as you can get! This should be a sentimental night, perfect for music, candlelit dinners and going to a very artistic movie together (and talking about it for hours afterwards).    There are several indications that you may travel in June, too, another way to enjoy a little time away from the office.   The weekend of June 26-27 would be ideal for a trip to a nearby town with the one you love (even a friend). Uranus will send the mighty Sun a powerful bolt, and all systems will be go!  I told you, honey!!  We're good to go!!!     If you need to take a business trip, my choice for you would be to schedule a visit to a client or colleague on Friday, June 25. It would also be an ideal day to sign a contract, make a presentation or have an important interview. With Mercury in a sweet angle to Jupiter, this will be everyone's favorite day for very different reasons!"  Favorite days KICK ASS!  Especially the ones we can't put back, gasp!!    And looking over the other pertinent horoscopes (Libra, Scorpio) it appears the Pride weekend and days surrounding it are setting up perfectly for a grand adventure fit for fairy tales...

      Anyone familiar with this blog or its author knows anniversaries are a big deal around here.  Especially the epic variety.  And today, the unofficial first day of summer, finds us at the one year mark of a trip out of legends.  But first, a bit of backstory, as usual.    It's no secret that the Boy and I love Seattle.  It was our first city we fell in love with together and each trip to the end of I-5 has marked a very important and identifiable point in our lives.    The maiden trip at the end of May 2001 encapsulated life at that point perfectly.  We were finishing up our sophomore years of college, the Boy had made a life-changing and major-shifting decision to follow his heart to Graphic Design, I had hit a magnificent stride in my journalistic endeavors, and we were together in the big city, ready to gay it up like never before.  Well, as much as we could without being able to visit any bars, of course.     We thought we could channel some of that wonderfully sunny energy to our visit in January of 2002.  The world had changed while we'd been away and so had we.  I found myself still in the throws of self-doubt and confusion about my place in the universe, but hoped a 10-day stretch in the Emerald City with the Boy would help.  It did, and there were many an adventure had during our stay, but I appreciated them only after the Spring Semester began.    Six months later, the world was looking much brighter as we made our way back for our first ever Pride celebration.  It was also the first meeting of the two most important people in my life.  I spent the weeks leading up to the vacation worried, excited and in awe of the fact that Lorraine and Levi would be meeting.  I needn't have worried.  They got along famously and the trip was spectacularly epic in every way.    I reprised the winter visit again in December of 2002 for my first Tori concert, but since it was made sans the Boy, who was across the Atlantic at the time, it will only get a passing mention here.    And at last, we come to the famous visit of June 2003.  Freshly graduated and trying to avoid a fate at the UI Library, I made my way to the coast, armed with resumes and writing samples to see what I could see.  I'd been on the law school waiting list since April and had decided to stop thinking about that possibility and focus on what new opportunities may be staring me in the face.  What better place to start than the city I hope to eventually reside?  Had just started "The Artist's Way", morning pages were still in their infancy and yoga had not yet occurred to me.  This was also the first time I'd seen Levi since our farewell in a London train station in January.    Last year at this time found us at the Wild Rose, drinking (my first) beers and talking big talks.  The next four days were the most glorious we'd ever spent in the city, literally and metaphorically.  The sun was up at 8 every morning and Seattle's infamous clouds and drizzle were off playing somewhere else.  Managed to get the first tan of the summer on that trip.  As each day came and went, with more and more offices visited and left with my materials on desks, the signs mounted.  Every little thing was momentous.  Of course, I can only remember a scant few now, but I remember there being more than a handful at the time.    Like the clear skies all day every day.  Like people-watching and writing three long, lazy pages in our coffee shop on Broadway.  Like seeing God in that coffee shop, at our table, two days later.  Like buying the Michael Chabon-edited edition of McSweeney's at the Bailey Coy Bookstore.  Like meeting a girl named Josephine at the Rose (what else would her name be?).  Like driving around the city listening to the Summer Mix because it was the only CD player we could both listen to.  Like listening to the Boy gasp as he heard "Hollywood" for the first time.  Like reading this horoscope from the latest "Stranger" the morning of the last day:  "'History is made out of the failures and heroism of each insignificant moment.' This observation by the writer Franz Kafka has special significance for you right now, Capricorn.  Every little action you take will have unimaginable weight, and the cumulative effect of your many little actions may alter conditions you'd assumed were impervious to change.  Even your passing thoughts and idle fantasies will have more influence than usual to shape your future.  Until June 20, there will be no such thing as a trivial detail for you.  My advice?  Act as if each moment is a promise of the life you want to be living next October."      I still have yet to figure out how my traipsing off to Seattle to find a job promised a life in the law school basement, but I'll take it at its word.    And now that summer's here, I can't wait to get back and dive into whatever new adventure the city's holding for us.  It's the one thing I have no problem giving over to the universe to do with us what it will; there's just something in the air in Seattle.

      I'm not in the mood for a drag show.  I want to stay in and devour Book 5, having watched The Chamber of Secrets last night (in addition to The Dreamers, which was totally great by itself, but it ALSO had the Garden State trailer on it....gasp!!!).  I'm fighting off a summer cold and the preemptive medicine I took last night is lingering.    Made an appearance at the festival this afternoon, though, and apparently caught the eye of a young, buff, Japanese-American cop with braces named Janet.  She's from Boise but is in town for the festivities.  She sent a messenger to The Voice of God asking for an introduction.  Kathy's put me on the 'let them in free' list, even though she'd rather take advantage of me in her office.    I'm still not in the mood for a drag show, but I knew the moment Kathy said "No, seriously.  She wants to meet you." that I'd be going.    What should I wear?  Oh, and Happy Birthday to Brandon!!  I'll have a beer and shake my ass in your honor.

      Moscow makes me chuckle for many reasons, but one of the most prominent is the fact that every late-July gay&nbsp;folks from the region (all 18 of us) congregate for a parade, festival in the park and drag show.&nbsp;   It's very cute.&nbsp;   Think I'll have to stop by the park this weekend to check out the...scenery, as I have yet to attend a Moscow Pride celebration.&nbsp; And who knows, maybe there'll be a cute, quiet gal roaming around, new to these parts who needs a date to the big gay gala tomorrow night....

      Slowly coming back to that comfortable place where things can just be; it's quiet again and almost calm.&nbsp;   Had a good night of impressive speeches (you keep getting better, Mr. Kerry; keep it up), a satisfying leftover turkey pesto sandwich from Tuesday's great&nbsp;night out with Calamity Jane, mini yoga session (working on getting the bod back to where it was a month ago), and a round of nearly-forgotten evening pages.&nbsp; Before long, I'll retire to the futon with Book 5 to find out just what the woes of Mrs. Weasley are; they'll be fit for storytelling, I'm sure.&nbsp; But the blog-bug has been gnawing at the back of my mind all day, even though I don't really know what to say.   Think I figured out why the last few days have been so...off.&nbsp; Well, there are the obvious reasons:&nbsp; last week, being back from vacation, realizing that school starts in less than a month.&nbsp; But I realized this morning (during morning pages, no less) that the change, end, old/new path intersection, etc. came when I wasn't looking.&nbsp;   The Boy and I talked about it on our day of recovery after Pride.&nbsp; This feeling that something was wrapping up, coming to a close, making way for something else, something new.&nbsp; And somewhere&nbsp;after&nbsp;the days full of emptiness and before the fields finished changing colors, it did.&nbsp; I just thought the transition would be so subtle, I would look up one day and realize "Hey!&nbsp; It's here!&nbsp; The new path...and I'm already on it!"&nbsp; Didn't think it'd hit when I smelled fall on the yellowing wheat on the drive back.&nbsp; It's not as though the 'something new' has just landed at the door, unannounced and expecting a meal.&nbsp; I still feel like I'm at the top of the hill, looking around, taking a rest between rounds, enjoying the view and the pause.&nbsp; But it's time to start thinking about the trip down.&nbsp; And what made the return more jarring than usual was not getting the chance to feel the wrapping up, the closing of everything behind, not being able to say goodbye.&nbsp; It was suddenly over, and while it's not entirely gone, it's too far away to see my wave.&nbsp;   But if the last few years have taught me anything, it's that I can't try to force what is into what was.&nbsp; Comparing the two is out, too.&nbsp; The only thing to do is to keep moving forward.&nbsp; Because the other thing I've learned is that even though changes and new beginnings can be scary and difficult, they can also be a lot of fun and hold great gifts behind their backs.&nbsp;   So I'll sit here a bit longer, watching the skies darken a bit earlier, maybe finish another book or two, and will think about coming down another day.&nbsp;

      Get out the party streamers and kazoos; load up the record player and pop some corn!&nbsp; We're gonna do each other's hair and party until we fall over!&nbsp;   It's Lorraine's birthday and to celebrate, her hometown is throwing a big parade.&nbsp; Her whole family is descending on the 100+ year-old mansion&nbsp;to perfect the big float and put the finishing touches on Lorraine's headdress.&nbsp;   It will be a celebration fit for legends and I can't wait to see the scars.

      Is Mercury in retrograde again?&nbsp; Is the moon waxing in a particularly strange way this month?&nbsp; Is New Jersey seceding from the Union?&nbsp; Because really, something is going on in the cosmos and it's fucking my shit up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I find myself in a rough transition&nbsp;into ordinary life these days and I don't know what the hell it's about.&nbsp; Everything just seems a bit off...quirky, in fact.&nbsp;   For starters, my garbage disposal is protesting my return to the apartment by just humming when I flip the switch.&nbsp; No disposal to speak of...just humming.&nbsp;   I broke my hot Calvin capris.&nbsp; They have completely supperfluous straps across the tops of the pockets that snap on to the side.&nbsp; Must have been too zealous with the one on the left because&nbsp;the snap&nbsp;popped right off and now I must live with a flapping strap above my left pocket.&nbsp;   I can't stay awake past 10 to save my life.&nbsp; Want to read (because I can't get enough of Book 5 already)?&nbsp; Or watch the late re-run edition of Will & Grace?&nbsp; No, sorry.&nbsp; The eyes start to water and head droops long about 1007 and it's downhill after that.&nbsp; And THEN, I can't pull myself out of bed before 7; consequently, I'm getting to work later and later as each day goes by.   Speaking of work...it's a fucking fridge in here.&nbsp; My productivity level is lower than usual, as my fingers are numb, which doesn't make for the best typing.&nbsp; And I can't get enough junk food while I'm here.&nbsp; Cupcake at 1030?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Hotdog, Doritos and Wild Cherry Pepsi for lunch?&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; Doughnut for dessert?&nbsp; Why the hell not?&nbsp; Take the stairs to compensate for the cuisine and drive to work on account of the above-mentioned lateness?&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha!&nbsp; Surely you jest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      " It was at these times he began to understand, after all these years of study and performance of feats and wonders and surprises, the nature of magic.&nbsp; The magician seemed to promise that something torn to bits might be mended without a seam, that what had vanished might reappear, that a scattered handful of doves or dust might be reunited by a word, that a paper rose consumed by fire could be made to blossom from a pile of ash.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   But everyone knew it was an illusion.     &nbsp;   The true magic of this broken world lay in the ability of the things it contained to vanish, to become so thoroughly lost, that they might never have existed in the first place.  "&nbsp; --Michael Chabon,  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay     &nbsp;  Tried to&nbsp;make sense of the last week, how it began and what it turned into before anyone could blink, and the only thing that comes close is that book.&nbsp; Everything&nbsp;is going just as the heroes have always dreamed, but dared not hope&nbsp;too seriously for, and&nbsp;they&nbsp;still&nbsp;have so much ahead of them, not the least of&nbsp;which is enjoying each moment that seems to carry&nbsp;its own unbelievably perfect gift.&nbsp; And then they're blindsided by the most tragic, crippling event and even holding the book suddenly becomes painful.&nbsp;   He's on his way back to Montana today with his stepmom and her mother.&nbsp; They'll get Marj (stepmom)&nbsp;settled and arranged before he makes his ride back to Bozeman sometime this week.&nbsp; As unbearable as it all has been, it seems that the most difficult part still lays ahead.&nbsp; And the only thing that keeps me from curling up and crying for him are the memories.&nbsp;   Thursday was the hardest, I think.&nbsp; He decided to speak at the funeral, to give his dad a proper goodbye and all of Mitch's friends an image of their old ski buddy, co-adventurer, and friend.&nbsp; But the pastor who married Mitch and Marj had things to say first.&nbsp; Levi's aunts and I exchanged knowing glances&nbsp;between us throughout his sermon and made frequent looks over&nbsp;at Levi to make sure he wouldn't be&nbsp;rushing the stage.&nbsp; The man mentioned Mitch's name no more than three times.&nbsp; Oh, he would  use&nbsp; his name to illustrate a particular passage or Bible story, but he&nbsp;only&nbsp;spoke  of  Mitch a scant few times.&nbsp;   But Levi kept it together as he stood behind the podium and we all sighed huge as he began.&nbsp; We cried as we listened to the nicknames (Dirthead, Uncle Dirt, Dirt 13), and laughed at the image of Mitch sneaking in chicken soup from his mom because Stacey (his first wive, Levi and Olivia's mom) couldn't cook.&nbsp; And as he spoke of his father's generosity, sincerity, kindness, humor and sly grin Levi wishes he'd inherited, I watched in awe of his ability to hold everyone around him as they cried, lifting them up, his back never breaking and comedic timing never failing.&nbsp;   I always knew that about you, hon.&nbsp; Your ability to make everyone else feel better, no matter what you're feeling; to be the unwavering support, to be exactly what someone else needs whenever they need you.&nbsp; So I shouldn't have been surprised to see you&nbsp;do precisely that over and over, even though your heart&nbsp;was breaking.&nbsp;   You amaze me, Luke.&nbsp; You have&nbsp;his grin and mischievous sparkle in your&nbsp;eye, as well as everything else you honor in him.&nbsp; You're my hero, and I hope to be like you when I grow up.   The&nbsp;gravesite service was blessedly short, and as the&nbsp;masses cleared, leaving only Mitch's good friends and wilder relatives, a cousin brought out an armful of six-packs and everyone grabbed a bottle.&nbsp; The toast kicked off the beginning of a long night of&nbsp;partying, just as he would have wanted.&nbsp; A friend stayed behind to make sure the empties and piles of dirt on top of the casket stayed put as the grave was sealed and covered.&nbsp;   After a much-needed break with Stacey's sisters and their families back at the condo, we made our way to one of Mitch's friend's home, where vodka tonics were followed by Mexican beers, followed by Jamaican rum and Coke, followed by more beer.&nbsp; The most surreal moment of the evening came after listening to more stories about Dirthead, icy roads at 120 mph and&nbsp;forgotten friends in the truckbed.&nbsp; The Boy and I found ourselves in a circle with his mom, sister, aunts, neighbors, cousins, and Mitch's friends, passing joints and laughing our asses off.&nbsp;   The party continued back at the condo, where I acted upon Stacey's recommendation that someone start writing some of this shit down.&nbsp; And so, here are some snipets of the evening.&nbsp; Don't ask us what half of them mean, but they all were the funniest things we'd ever heard/said at the time:   " Damn  that woman can crochet!"   " And  there's a shitter!"   "You want us to lay down with you?"   "Where is that Brit?"&nbsp; "Stickin' it in your aunt!"   "It's like 'Stacy's Mom', but different!"   "You guys, I've never been this fucked up before..."   "If you eat the muffins tonight..."&nbsp; "You'll have to make do with eight Almond Bear Claws."   "Aunt Sharyn is a bit like Gollum."   "Pakistanis are always the butt of jokes."&nbsp; "That's because they're all taxi drivers."   "I bet Grandpa was like 'God-fucking-damnit!'"&nbsp; "Your grandfather   NEVER  &nbsp;said that!"&nbsp; "What?&nbsp; He never said 'God'?"   "She slays me, I tell ya!"   "If I were sober..."&nbsp; "I'd kick you where it hurts!"   "I'm ready for love!"   The only thing better than experiencing each of those firsthand was relating them to Levi's grandmother the next night.&nbsp; Later, Levi and I took his sister, Olivia out to Charleys for our own celebration.&nbsp; Natalie joined us eventually and the circle of friends&nbsp;was completed when Jen called.&nbsp; We drank, laughed, talked and bonded&nbsp;like never before.&nbsp; When the DJ played Billy Idol and AC/DC back-to-back, I knew Mitch approved.&nbsp;   And now, I find myself in a much-too-hot apartment with half the day gone, thinking about a&nbsp; man I met only once but have finally gotten to know.&nbsp; He was beautiful, crazy, genuine, adoring of his children, and never spent a day doing anything he didn't believe in.&nbsp;   We've come to the part in the book where everything has changed and we wonder how there can be another chapter; how can the heroes go on after so much happened?&nbsp; But they do; the story always does.&nbsp; And so will we.&nbsp; So open a bottle of beer today, put on some U2,&nbsp;Tom&nbsp;Petty, Coldplay, or Lynnard Skinnard&nbsp;and drink a toast to Mitch.&nbsp; Or the next time you're driving down a dirt road and "Bad to the Bone" or "She Drives Me Crazy" comes on the radio, crank it up and&nbsp;sing loud&nbsp;for ol' Dirthead.&nbsp;

      Back home again and it feels really weird.&nbsp;   I should write about the last few days, but haven't the strength, so that post will wait until tomorrow sometime after coffee and before quality futon-time.&nbsp; I think the biggest shock is being alone after having been surrounded by people non-stop since Wednesday; find myself wanting to have someone to cuddle, chuckle or cry with, but I haven't been great at chatting with the few people I've come into contact with today.&nbsp;   But the plants look fabulous...the babies are coming along nicely.&nbsp; Thanks, Calam.

      Just spent an hour and a half reading and replying to emails, catching up on blogs and comments.&nbsp; It's funny how wonderful reading everybody's normal, day-to-day stories can feel.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The folks left around 10 and Joe will be home from work in a bit.&nbsp; Been ambling around, doing laundry, drinking coffee and will soon do some afternoon pages.&nbsp; Starting to feel better, like myself again, getting ready to head up to the unknown tomorrow.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We had a great conversation Sunday evening about holding on to these perfect moments because we would need them to get us through the hard ones.&nbsp; Of course, we meant the ones in November when we'd be stressing over this project or that class and wondering why we even signed up for this shit.&nbsp; We talked about the pause at the top and bottom of each breath, knowing that no matter where we are, it is always with us, carrying its quiet solace and we can always stop, hold on to it, and use it to get through the next bit.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Didn't know why I was such a mess yesterday.&nbsp; Kept thinking that if   I   felt this way, what must he be going through, which made me want to be with him all the more&nbsp;and&nbsp;'carry' some of it for him, as impossible as it sounds.&nbsp; But maybe that's what happened.&nbsp; And now I'm pooling my reserves, holding on to the weekend, memories&nbsp;and breaths, getting ready to take them to him.

      This story can only be told just the way it happened.&nbsp; The Boy began it perfectly.    &nbsp;   Saturday:   An unexpected party   As always, her timing was freakishly appropriate. I walked home from work through the park and spotted her ambling down the sidewalk to my apartment. With a goofy wave and a shake of our heads (followed by the public fondling) we began our latest weekend of life-altering adventure and bonding.     &nbsp;   We laid on the couch (and on each other) for the obligatory hour of catch-up conversation that marks the beginning of our reunions. I recounted my week of being the cool role model for 6-year-olds everywhere, she talked of the previous night's drive with an old pal, still waiting on a copy of my London mix that I forgot to send 7 months ago. (oops)     &nbsp;   We filled the whole hour before she asked, "So do you want to eat now, or should we wait for Lorraine?"     &nbsp;   My gasp nearly propelled me across the room. "Nooooo, Are you joking! SHUT UP! She is NOT COMING! Are you serious? Don't you fuck with me like that! Don't you even!"     &nbsp;   By her devilish grin I knew it was true. "She's on the road right now."     &nbsp;   "Shut.the.fuck.up."     &nbsp;   But how could this be? Lorraine at my house? In my town? Black Queen? The grand Clam Dragon herself? The secret benefactor I worship and adore on a level separate from all others? The three of us together at last, after an aching year of separation and longing? Earlier in the week i had made a joke of saying "So you gonna get Lorraine to come up, too?" We laughed about the possibility, sure. But always in that because-it'll-never-happen-in-a-million-years kind of way. The dream was too perfect and painfully impossible to entertain.     &nbsp;   After 20 minutes of shock and bewilderment, I realized this changed everything. The three of us haven't been together since last July, and that was an event big enough to kill a team of horses. This was not simply another rockin' trip with Andrea, (which is rare and momentous enough) this was HUGE! The Queen touched down around 10 last night, and we haven't stopped rubbing each other since. Before bed I whined to Andrea, "I'm afraid to go to sleep because i just know she'll be gone when I wake up, and then I'll die! I'll just DIE!" I have to keep poking her to make sure she's really there. She brought her fishing poles, and we're off to find a package of Italian Sausage. The rest is up to the Fates. How does one compress a year's worth of "Quality Time" into 2 magical days? I don't know, but somehow, I know we'll find a way (tear).     &nbsp;  She came to grieve the end of a relationship.&nbsp; A relationship that may find itself again, but for now has ended in its current form.&nbsp; I must admit, a part of me was worried about seeing her again.&nbsp; It's been a year.&nbsp; A year since our rationalized 'reconnection' and I wondered if we could be in the same room without feeling the familiar tension.&nbsp; But there was none.&nbsp; We got on like we always had, without discomfort, uneasiness&nbsp;or too many sparks.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  The fates handed us a brilliant Saturday indeed.&nbsp; Made our way to the site of the October 2000 photoshoot: the bank of a hot river on an even hotter day.&nbsp; But we found just enough shade to keep us busy for a couple of hours.&nbsp; Lorraine and the Boy worked on their sketchpads while I dabbled a bit in mid-afternoon pages before lugging out Book 4, which never received much attention.&nbsp; Ended up chatting while they drew and even made a mad dash for a stray Coke can as it attempted to flee the sunk sack full of beverages.&nbsp; The yoga certainly is paying off, as my ass (who was saved from an embarrassing dunk in said river on said mad dash on account of my stunning agility due to said yoga) can attest.&nbsp; Before long, though, Lorraine's air conditioned hotel room beckoned and we soon found ourselves there, cleaning and priming ourselves for a night on the town with dinner at a favorite Italian eatery and Spider Man 2 (which earned a solid B+ from Lorraine.)  &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Sunday : Learning to fly  &nbsp;  Lazy wanderings&nbsp;around downtown Bozeman after a spot-on wonderful breakfast at the CatEye Cafe.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;marveled at the waitress'&nbsp;tight jeans&nbsp;and tank-top dress code and drooled over the hot cowgirl outside our window.&nbsp; Lorraine and Levi&nbsp;found some keepsakes at a favorite bookstore and we soon found ourselves in Cooper Park&nbsp;(named in&nbsp;honor of Lewis and Clark)&nbsp;with our respective reads.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a round of horoscopes, yoga&nbsp;and&nbsp;the kick-off the the Third Task, the rain convinced us&nbsp;to move the party inside.&nbsp;We relocated to the Boy's apartment, opened the&nbsp;windows, turned on the fans and enjoyed the&nbsp;wet fresh air and each other's company.&nbsp;&nbsp;We gave&nbsp;and got foot massages, lounged and laughed, smiled and shook heads.&nbsp; Lorraine and I retired to the spare bedroom for a bit, leaving Levi to his latest creation.&nbsp; My guilty grin a while later confirmed what he already knew,&nbsp;and I assured him (and myself) that I knew what I was doing and why.&nbsp; No attempts at recreating what we once had.&nbsp; No fantasies of&nbsp;riding off into the sunset&nbsp;together.&nbsp; No rationalizing, no excuses.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Before I knew what happened, I found myself in the middle of a perfect moment.&nbsp; Laying on The Boy's couch, legs sprawled across Lorraine's lap, gripping Book 4 tight, gasping at every other paragraph, listening to one of the new mixes, watching Levi paint out of the corner of my eye, smelling rain on the grass outside, everything was in its right place.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Had take a breath at one point and write a bit about it all:  &nbsp;   Sitting between the two best people I've known, reading a great book, sipping great wine, reveling in afterglow (sans guilt or conflict), with the smell of rain on the air.&nbsp; Couldn't really stop to breathe, let alone write about it.&nbsp; Just felt wrong to stop  being .&nbsp; And at last, a respite.&nbsp; But just for a minute because I want to get back to it.&nbsp; He's painting, she's reading and I've never felt like the planets have aligned to converge such a perfect, needed, surprising gift in such a way.&nbsp; It may be the hormones and it may be the wine.&nbsp; But it could be just what everything kept telling me would happen.&nbsp; Just sit back and let little, seemingly insignificant things happen because that's where the most momentous things will emerge.&nbsp; And I find myself drowning in it all.&nbsp; In a cool, safe, fated kind of way.   &nbsp;  We finished out the night with pizza, more great conversation and a titch more reading before bed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Monday : This is gonna hurt like hell  &nbsp;  The Boy arose at 6 on account of his having to be at work by 8.&nbsp; Lorraine and I bid him a fond farewell and crawled back to bed for a bit before making our own departures.&nbsp; The phone rang around 830, making me jump, literally.&nbsp; I made Lorraine answer.&nbsp; It was the Boy and I was relieved.&nbsp; Then I saw her face change and I shivered.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  "Here, I'll let you talk to Andrea," she said as she put her hand on my shoulder and handed me the receiver.  &nbsp;  "What's up?"  &nbsp;  "I just got a call.&nbsp; My dad's been killed in a farming accident.&nbsp; I'm heading over there..."  &nbsp;  Everything stopped.&nbsp; The air in my lungs and stomach evaporated.&nbsp; I couldn't speak.&nbsp; He kept talking, but I couldn't respond.&nbsp; All I knew was this sudden pain in my chest that hurt more than anything I've ever known.&nbsp; Finally, I knocked myself into reality.  &nbsp;  "We're coming over."  &nbsp;  And we stayed until noon.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Eventually, he went to be with his stepmother and Lorraine and I headed south, although the only place I really wanted to be was at his side.  &nbsp;  We drove down 'together', she following me through the forest to West Yellowstone and beyond.&nbsp; We said our goodbyes at a rest stop between Idaho Falls and Blackfoot.&nbsp; She was opening a water bottle as I pulled away.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As I neared the Pocatello exit, a song from the mix from last night came on that was too appropriate to be coincidental.&nbsp; I turned it up and sang along, hoping he might hear.  &nbsp;  "Light up, light up.&nbsp; As if you have a choice.&nbsp; Even if you cannot hear my voice, I will be right beside you dear."  &nbsp;  I looked to my left and saw Lorraine in the passing lane, waving the sign for "I love you."  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  It's almost midnight and I don't want to get into this big bed by myself.&nbsp; The parents are leaving for Oregon tomorrow.&nbsp; I'm going to Driggs Wednesday to be with him before the funeral Thursday.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yesterday has never felt so far away.&nbsp;

       urlLink     Innocent and cute my ass   Posted by  urlLink Hello      &nbsp;   And so, after much toil and strife, I at last downloaded the version of AIM I already have in my effort to join&nbsp;my peeps in a chatroom conversation.&nbsp; The gals had already made their departure, but Levi, Brandon and I didn't let that stop us from letting our hair down.&nbsp; We covered it all: the textbook cervix,&nbsp;JJ's inches, the&nbsp;Grand Am&nbsp;cult, the secret lives of&nbsp;"innocent" kittens.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Brandon put it best when he said: "it's all fun and games until the next time you see me i'm wearing a purple shirt and driving a pontiac."

      She introduced herself as she made her exit.  Be damned if I can remember her name, but she wanted to say 'hey' because she's relatively new in town and it was months before she found a gang of friends.    "So when I see a fresh face....it's kinda clique-ish around here..." (which is totally true; everyone knows everyone who walks in the place.  But it seems friendlier than the place a block away.) "It's hard to break in and make friends sometimes..."  I explained I'm from here originally, even though I'm up north now as she inched toward her car.  She said something about something else I can't remember as she left...something about me being familiar with something.  God, what happened to all those journalism skills?    Think she was talking to her significant other during the last post, but I'm definitely enjoying all this "I remember what it was like for me when I used to do what you're doing and I just wanted to be nice and say hi" stuff I've received from cute lesbians lately.       This place is about to close, but it's too early to start scoping out the bar.  Suppose the front porch will have to do.

      Enjoying the wi-fi outside on the porch at the College Market.  I've only been here about once in the last 7 years, but hey.  Saw a couple of cute gals sitting out here when Mom and I drove by a bit ago on our way home from Buddies and (gasp!) they're still here!  The one just confirmed my suspicions by her phone conversation, detailing the latest dyke drama that ruined her girls night at Charleys.  For my part, I just finished reading the latest issue of  urlLink Diversity  (I worked there for one story, you know), so she knows the score.  She vaguely reminds me of the Voice of God.    My other agenda in coming down here is to tear away at the last 200 pages of Book 4 left.  I can't get enough.  Just finished the Second Task and it almost killed me.  This just in: she drives a Jetta.   Do you think the laptop makes me look hot?  Or is it the tight London shirt and new jeans I'm conveniently wearing.  Had the locks trimmed a bit yesterday...nothing major, just rearranged so they can grow out properly.  But definitely have the cute coffee-shop dyke thing going.    She's thinking of going to see SpiderMan tomorrow.   The thunder is starting again, so I should put this thing away and see about making eyes at the girl over the top of my book.

      I've had the house to myself since I woke, nearly 3 hours ago.  Just got done with a round morning pages on the back deck and straighten..er, I mean, doing some light cleaning before Mom gets home.  I inherited her eye for clutter.  I can't have it.  So, I made my way from room to room, organizing this, folding that; I even scrubbed down the countertops in the kitchen.  Wonder if she'll notice.  She called while I was on the phone with Lorraine to let me know I have a dentist appointment tomorrow, even though I've outgrown their insurance, to deal with my gingivitis.  Whatever.  I flossed and brushed my teeth twice this morning; that'll fix it all.    Getting excited for the Bozeman trip.  It will be nice to lounge around with the Boy and our books.  They're like kids, really, except they don't pee their pants or have pork product issues.  Then before we know it, the parents and I will be making our way to the Oregon coast for a couple of days.  Yay.  Actually feeling better about that than during the last few days.  Getting my strength back and all.  Ready to deal with any shenanigans or goings-on.  And then it'll be time to trudge back up north for a month of normalcy before the whirlwind of second year begins.  Lorrainey may or may not be up for a visit, which should be good for a story or made-for-TV-special.  It's been a year since the last get-together and even though I realize I'm probably too excited (read: attached) than is good for me, I'll be okay with whatever happens.    I miss my peeps.  It's nice to be in a place where everything's taken care of for me and all I have to decide is which movie to see or pair of shoes to pick out (got a couple new pair yesterday, score), but I'm getting ready to be back in my cozy apartment.  Got a good fortune at lunch yesterday.  "You have found good company--enjoy."    Mom, of course, took it to mean her.    I said, "I like to think it means my new gang."    "Huh?" she scoffed.    "My law school friends.  My peeps."    "What does that stand for?" she said, thinking it was an acronym.

      Things I've done today (the role of "today" will be played by "during the last week"):  Slept until 1130.  I'm not really a fan of the 'in bed by 2, up at 1' schedule, but I seem to be getting there.    Found my long-lost thumb-ring.  "Oh yea, I found that right after you left." Mom said as I came gasping into the room with my prize.  Put my favorite Sony Discman to rest.  It's been with me since 9th grade; it was time.  Bought a new mobile CD player.  It's jog-proof; just in case I get crazy.  Went for the middle of the higher end brands, Magnavox, because Sam, my cute RCA boombox, has been acting up and I refuse to pay $70 for a Sony.  It has a Digital FM Tuner Radio; long playing time; Digital Dynamic Bass Boost (that was the clincher for me); and all CD program modes (made damn sure we had random!).  It will come in handy when the parents and I fold ourselves into the pick-up and do the Oregon coast thing next week.  I'm leaving out the part where I bought it at the Evil Empire; perhaps I should name it Walt.  I felt like asking the female employees if they're part of the 1.6 million.    Gave Harley a bath in the driveway.  Didn't get to the business about cleaning the inside, but she's pretty damn sparkly on the outside.  And that's what matters most.    Got Harley's oil changed.  Was about 1,000 miles late, so decided it would be a good idea before heading to Bozeman Friday.  My cooling system fluid is a lovely rust color; they tell me it should be green, but I won't have to worry about it til winter, so I just won't.    Watched Kill Bill Vol. I with Dad.  He quit narrating ("Got his knife"; "Kid's home from school.") about an hour in and seemed disappointed and confused at the end.  Just made me want Vol. II more.  They really shouldn't be watched by themselves, there's too much missing.  But Uma looked especially good on the huge, high-definition TV and that's a very good thing.      Cracked the half-way point in Book 4.  It's the day of the First Task and it's so intense.  Loving every damm thing about it.  The tension between Harry and Ron...they should just make out and get on with it; Hermione and her crusade to save the house-elves while repairing Harry and Ron's relationship in between studying for class and helping Harry be Champion; Mad-Eye and his moods (bad pun, I realize, but the best I can do on the fly); and the British edition with its non-Americanized language.  I love queues!  And being on about something!    Rented "Welcome to Mooseport" (for Mom; she, like everybody, loves Raymond) and "In America" (for me; I, like everybody if they know what's good for them, love Irish immigrants).  And on a completely random note, go  urlLink Seattle lawyers .  Props to The General for the link.

      Well, I didn't have my day alone, but at least it was spent out of the house.  Went with one of Mom's colleagues (don't ask; it's a long story) to 9/11 and took a trip with Dad out to the grandparents in the evening.    The movie was about what I expected.  Still have to divorce the man from the message when it comes to Michael, but I'm glad I saw it and it gave me all the more resolve that Bush must go.    Coming back to myself a bit more after a trip to Burley today for (the other) Grandma's birthday celebration.  Picnics in the park have a way of doing that.  Just getting ready to do some outside yoga, the first since the round on the beach last July 4.  Then I think I'll settle on the front porch with Book 4 and a Fat Tire.

      from going home and part of me can't wait to get back.  I always know it will happen, but it still surprises me when I get my fill of home life and yearn for my own space again.    Spent two days in Salt Lake with Mom, shopping our asses off and having a pretty good time, including a big gay talk on the side.  My system is still in shock over the recent increase in the subject's discussion and overall, it's a good thing.  But I'm coming away with the feeling that even with the new openness, they still don't know me.  Part of it is because there are things I can't and won't tell them, but part of it, at least as far as Mom's concerned, is her thing she does about seeing everything from her perspective.  Never was a good one for empathy.  She sees things the way  she  sees them and is not big on taking a look from the other person's viewpoint.  She doesn't understand how I could be "so upset" at the cousins asking me about myself when I flash my tattoo around, have a HRC sticker on my car and have told people with "direct links" to my parents.  When I try to explain how I've tried to shield her and Dad from having to deal (in a negative way) with an issue they struggle so much with (and also because she once told me never to tell anyone she knew because she couldn't defend something she doesn't agree with), she tells me I should let all that effort and worry go (sounds good, huh?) because I've already acted in all these ways that let everyone around her know anyway.    It's been 5 years, after all, and really, I should know how far they've progressed even though we haven't discussed it as much in those 5 years as we have in the last 2 weeks.  If I really am as open and okay with it as I say I am, I shouldn't be so surprised when my family members bring it up and want to talk to me about it.    And then we get to the part about looking for a partner.  Really, I've only just started finding a social group and relating to people in a way I never have before (most people do that when they're 16, you know).  I've spent so much time alone that maybe I'm just like those people who never find someone because they aren't willing to give up their space for the sake of a relationship.    It's hard to explain that I know exactly what I'm waiting for when I can't talk about my experiences.    Sigh.    I need to spend today by myself.  I think my way out of what I know when I'm here.  I start to think she has a point about all these things.  I start to see myself the way she does.

      Lazy summer days are fun.  Today's big adventure was hitting the Poky shopping circuit with Mom.  I cleaned up.  Three new pairs of pants from Downeast Outfitters and new yoga garb from TJ Maxx.  Sweeet.  Even have our eyes on some hot suits at Dillard's.  They just might be on sale in Salt Lake...you never know!    Mom's lightening up more, which is so nice.  It's easier to say 'no' to a bad outfit and we laugh a lot.  Even got her caught up on the Viscous situation this morning and it didn't end in tears.  She managed to get the words 'gay' and 'lesbian' out without choking.  "You should just find yourself a nice young man and settle down," she said with a laugh.  "I know.  Levi and I should just stop the charade."  "Really!!"  "Eww, gross."  "Really?"  "Really.  If I can't get excited about Levi, there's no hope."  "Hmmm."  The Viscous conversation didn't last much longer beyond the bare facts, but she did give me a hug after she'd escaped to her bathroom to get ready.  I'm not sure it helped paint a reassuring picture of the lesbian community, but at least it was the truth.  I'd been having a hard time trying to bring up the topic because there was so little to tell, but the last Mom heard, things were just getting rolling and I knew she was wondering about it.  Truth be told, I'd been thinking about V more than I should have been the last few days.  Not wistfully or "Well, maybe...", but I thought it might be nice to see her again when I managed to make my way to Bozeman before heading back to Moscow.    I should have known better.  And thankfully, the Boy helped me see the way before I made a mistake.  There's no big story to tell, just more of what I already knew about her tendency to hear whatever she wants (regardless of whatever is actually said) and turn it into a bigger, more dramatic, more harrowing saga.  I wasn't surprised to hear the spin she put on our story, but was disappointed and more hurt than I realized at the time.  But it got me to delete her numbers from my cell phone and put any ideas of friendly coffee out of my mind.  I know it has nothing to do with me, but it still confuses me that something has to be twisted into an ego-stroking soap opera to be worthy of telling friends.  Sigh.  Oh well.  I'm having too good a time doing nothing to think about it much.    And I don't really know what drove me to tell Mom about it.  But after all the times of listening about Joe's woes in love and roommates, it seemed about time for my turn.    "You need someone more mature," she said after telling me what a wacko V is, in a vaguely comforting, supportive, motherly way.  "It's true, I do."  You have no idea, Mom.

      What could top a 4th of July spent in bed until 11, on the lawn reading Book 4 until 330, savoring Mom's homemade potato salad with dinner and trying not to think about the visit to the Grandparents' house while watching the biggest fireworks show in Idaho, complete with painful 9.11 country songs?  The Burley Independence Day Parade, that's what!  Picked up Grandma around 1030 and crammed our way to our spots just before 11.  Secured my grape cotton candy shortly thereafter and the fun was underway.  Couldn't help but think about the very different parade I found myself at last week, but I don't think Seattle-ites could pull off the major pieces of farm equipment and old men on mopeds quite like this humble town on the plain.  Mom slapped me when I accidentally called the female forest rangers hot, but she was also laughing, which makes me smile.  We're recovering from the whole experience by searching the (empty) air waves for entertainment.  Maybe we should break out the White Russians and invite some black ones over for a game of pool.

      She's on her way home for her annual repose.  She can't wait to curl up downstairs or outside on the lawn and read for hours, getting up only to change books.  She felt the familiar tug to write, the one she's felt circling for a month, 30 miles ago and doesn't care how long she'll have to stay here to get it all down.    With every passing mile and new-yet-perfect song, the last two weeks and years slide into place.  She watches from her new perch, marveling and remembering and letting go.  She suddenly found herself up here on a lazy day last week.  The one they gave themselves to recover from their adventure on the coast.  It felt much like the first time there together, what with the U2 on the stereo and wall coverings about to change.  And at the same time, it felt like only last year, when every minute was taken by all by itself.  This realization came as they sat on her couch, him with his sketches, her with her lunch and revelations.  They're both at the top of their respective hills, after much work and toil, they're finally at the place they weren't completely sure they'd reach.  At first it seemed odd to actually be here, in one piece and so...content.    She's spent more time than usual thinking about the path(s) behind her.  Not longingly or jealously, but because she knows it's almost time to leave them where they lay, behind, for good.  She's about to start a new path and it may be a while before she's able to see this far in all directions again.  She's caught somewhere between something's end and a new thing's beginning.  And even though part of her is still sad at the end, it's almost habit to rejoice at the beginning, the change, the shift.  They've been good to her, even when she didn't know it at the time.  And when old habits start kicking in, telling her to figure this new thing out, she returns to the seeds planted over Christmas, about enjoying the quiet, the calm and the not moving.  She's learning to rest in the pause at the top and bottom of each breath.  It whispers to her and the messages are easier to hear (and follow) than the shouts and shoves that used to guide her.  The person she's been becoming is settling in and is about to take over.  But for the moment, everybody's resting, taking stock at the oasis she finds herself at.       She gave a bit of herself to someone again for the first time since she loved completely and remembers why she waits patiently, finding comfort in knowing such gifts won't hurt as much as she feared.     She's lived up to all her hype and is finally comfortable with being bored.  Soon she'll be ready to go journeying again, to explore and learn big things with a vengeance.  For now, though, she's enjoying the view, the adventure, exploring and learning while she sits still and lives in the pause.

The judge presiding over the trial at which I may or may not have to appear at Tuesday morning, THAT'S WHO!!

      I always talk a good line before she gets here.  I'm gonna resist; we're going to have a great time without going  there ; it's not the best idea with things the way they are for her back home; I don't even really  want  to go there; we can just be really good friends...really!  And for a while, I pull it off pretty well.    And then there's The Kiss.  The kiss I avoid the first little while she's here.  Not the 'hello' kiss or little cuddle kisses.  Those are fine and innocent.  I'm talking about the one that opens the door to other things.  As usual, I avoided it last night, vowing to myself that we would talk about the state of affairs back on the homestead.  At last update, they were on the equivalent of 'a break' and I convinced myself I wouldn't try anything funny while things were in such a precarious state.  And as usual, The Kiss happened.  And all my resolve, strength, lofty ideals about what should and shouldn't happen melted away.    Thank god I escaped to work before things got crazy.  I'm reassured by the lack of "I still love you!" feelings, but am a bit nervous about the "I'm still attracted to you" feelings.    Sigh.  Such a worry.

      Law school ruined me for reading.  There's just nothing I want to do less after a day of writing notes, typing notes, reading 80+ pages of material, writing briefs of said material, etc. than coming home and cracking open another book.  Thankfully, I've been able to replenish my reading-for-fun reserves on break.    Well, the library is ruining me for things, too.  Namely, alphabetizing.  Before this summer's projects of finding empty holdings via lists and lists of call numbers, I knew P came before Q in the line-up.  Likewise, I knew the call numbers P24 and P25 came before PE25.  But no longer.  Now L comes before K and SH sometimes passes for SE.    At least my day is almost over.  Have precisely 18 minutes left and there's nothing, I repeat, nothing waiting to be done once I get home.  Textbook should be sitting at the doorstep, but that's it.  I have all night to wait for the phone and/or door bell to ring.  Yay.  Think I'll spend it either on the futon with Harry or online with the Gang.  Or maybe both...it's just that kind of night.

      I post this, not for myself--because I've already read, been mad at and dealt with it--but so my failthful audience can have a glimpse of what we all will be contending with this month.  I realize we are not all Capricorns, but some of the messages included in my horoscope overlap with the other signs', so just go with it.  Consider yoursevles informed, and on notice.      "You got through July, your toughest month. Rest assured that August will be better and September will be the best month of all. In fact, it could become your very favorite month of the year. Every day, in every way, things are getting better for you.   I saw such heavy aspects for you last month (due to Saturn), with most of the stress centered on a partner or detractor. As a strong, practical Capricorn, you have proven to me that you are able to deal with all sorts of circumstances, including difficult ones, with admirable grace and even ease. I should have been mindful of those qualities in you.   Looking ahead to this month, it's a bit of a mixed bag-but certainly far better than what I saw for you in July!   Mercury, the planet of communication, transportation, commerce and contracts, will be retrograde just about all month long, from August 9 to September 2. That alone will bring down the level of progress any of us can expect to make, because when Mercury retrogrades, it is sleeping and we don't have its beneficial rays to help us assess, communicate or project forward with the same acuity that we are used to.   This doesn't mean you have to come to a grinding halt on all current projects. You can certainly plan, do research, contact others and conduct meetings. I would suggest, however, that you wait to announce final decisions. I will also ask you not to sign any contracts, but other than that, you are free to work as usual. Keep your antenna up for possible changes in strategy or direction, because they often spring up when Mercury is retrograde. Mercury retrograde is like a green light that changed to yellow: Caution is always warranted.   This time, Mercury will retrograde in your ninth house, a part of your chart that rules travel, important relationships with people at a distance, higher education, publishing, broadcasting and legal matters. ( So basically, anything I'm involved in  at all  ) For example, if you are about to start a semester at college or grad school, you may find that some of your favorite classes are unavailable to you. (Sign up as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.) If you ship a package, it could arrive broken or get delayed in customs. ( Already had one of my textbook orders cancelled. ) Have someone professionally pack it for you and make sure the paperwork is letter-perfect. If you plan to travel, show up early at the airport, even though there's a good chance your flight will be late (sad but true). If you are an author, your editor may request lots of revisions. Just shrug and do it-it seems to be part of the cosmic plan. Also, if you are involved in a legal matter, something may suddenly change in the way the case goes. You get the picture.   This area of travel/study/legal matters/higher education is very prominent for you right now, because Mars, Mercury and Jupiter are all filling your ninth house. But it's nothing compared to what's coming next month in this area, when even more planets are gathering there! ( I love planet orgies!! ) Apparently, one of these subjects is rapidly evolving into a key area of focus for you, so you'll be happy to hear that things will improve and progress quite a bit next month. I love it that so many planets are gathering in fellow earth sign Virgo, for you will feel more "in your element" and things will go your way.   Money is emphasized in your chart this month. This trend actually started on the full moon on the last day of last month, July 31, when you were focused on your salary or a purchase. If you are in the arts, you may have made a sale, but it is equally possible that you had a large bill to pay, no matter what field you're in. If that didn't happen on July 31, this same emphasis is still at play during the first four days of August. ( $2/hour raise, anyone? )  On August 17, Saturn, your ruling planet (and, therefore, very important to note), will have a fabulous meeting with good luck planet Jupiter. This is an exceedingly rare event and will not occur again in a similar way until May 2007. On this day, you will come up with a sensational idea that will require your collaboration with a partner or associate that you trust. Collaborate for either business or romantic reasons-gold-star results await you.   I wish I could say that the rest of the month will be quiet and uneventful, but just the opposite is true.   The first sign that something is up occurs on August 18, when Mars, the warrior planet, opposes Uranus, the planet ruling sudden, unexpected developments. This is a very explosive aspect that is capable of provoking quite a bit of anger from you or the other party involved. These two planets will play out their high-noon shootout in houses that center on attitudes, opinions and doctrine. A conflict of ideals with someone who does not see eye-to- eye with you could cause problems, arising from out of nowhere. You will see this played out in a larger scale in the papers, for there will be world events linked to this aspect, as well. It's an aspect that has a wide berth, covering the whole week before and after it occurs, so don't expect just August 18 to be problematic. ( Go epic cosmic dyke drama!  WOO! )  Then, on August 27, Uranus, planet of unexpected developments, will oppose the Sun. This is a separating aspect, causing people to go in separate directions, also quite suddenly and impulsively. Once again, events seem to come out of the blue. This aspect has a plus or minus of five days, and will therefore overlap with the August 18 aspect mentioned above.   Your third and ninth houses are drawn into this conflict, houses that concern relatives, namely your siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles and in-laws. It probably will not be the best month to talk politics with any of your relatives (even though there's a Presidential election coming up in the USA). Bringing up any kind of controversial topic would be a little like throwing a match on gasoline. Some months it's better to bury your head in a book.   These houses deal with travel, too, and Mercury is retrograde, so it would be wise to schedule a checkup for your car to make sure it is in good working order.   The end of the month is likely to be equally tumultuous. A full moon on August 29, plus or minus four days, is due to fall in your third house, the same area that we have been talking about. As I mentioned, this house rules short-distance travel, communication, contracts and negotiations. This time, the moon walks arm-in-arm with Uranus, bringing on a highly volatile influence.   By the time the full moon occurs on August 29, we will have been through the other two nerve-jangling aspects involving challenges to Uranus by Mars and the Sun, so everyone's likely to be exhausted. If you feel you can't quite cope, join the crowd.   Mercury will always exert its strongest pull on the days it turns retrograde or direct, this time on August 9 and September 2. At the time of the full moon, on August 29, plus or minus four days, Mercury will be getting ready to change gears. That means that Mercury could throw plans into confusion at this time. Try to build in a contingency plan, because the planets are telling us to expect the unexpected.   Romantically, your relationship should proceed more smoothly this month than last. You have Venus, the planet of happiness, in your house of commitment at month's end. When it comes to love, your mood will more likely be thoughtful and serious than flirtatious and carefree. That's fine-love can have a kaleidoscope of moods. You seem to be aware that a relationship has certain privileges and responsibilities for both parties. ( I have no idea what she's talking about. Maybe I should ask Lorraine when she gets here tomorrow. )  If one person is not cognizant of this reality, you will have to talk about how to bring things into better balance. You may have worked on this meditation last month, but then you didn't have help from lucky Jupiter in the way you will now. Jupiter will cooperate with Venus in the best way possible this month.   Your best romantic moment will arrive on Friday, August 13. Don't be superstitious: For you, this Friday the 13th will be great!"   So there you have it.  And you better watch out.

      GOD  DAMN   that woman can put together a persuasive summary of the importance of judicial appointments in relation to the American people's rights and liberties!!  Only Miss Q can pack two-hours' worth of reading material into 13 pages and have the reader nodding her head resolutely at the end.   Guess there won't be as much yoga tonight, but by god, there will be Harry Potter reading!  And I have to take down the Morpheus result from the Greek God quiz.

      I "suddenly remembered", while chatting with the big, mean-turned-surprisingly-nice-and-easy-going boss this morning about her week-long vacation that it's after the first of July, which means we're in the new fiscal year, which means the funds with which my pay-check is funded was replenished, which means it's time for said boss to reconsider my pay rate.  It was so intense.    "I'll talk to Mary Jane about it," she said pleasantly, making a reminder-Post-It note.     Damn right you will.     Cut to 7 hours later as I prepared to board the precarious elevator to the depths of the library's basement and said boss made her way into the mail room.  "Oh! I talked to Mary Jane about..."  "Oh right..." I said, preparing myself for the inevitable "...and you're screwed" speech, but hoping for the "...and we raised you to the $8.50 we said you'd get to begin with" because really, she  has  changed.    "and I was able to bump you up to $10."  ......   SAY SOMETHING!   "OH!  Great!  Thanks!"  So yea...for the next three weeks (one and a half pay periods), I'll be making big bucks.  Sweeet.    Finally in for the night, which feels nice.  Thought about going to The Grind for a bit to edit Miss Q's homework, but the thunder/windstorm changed my mind.  So we'll just have to make do with some yoga and Harry Potter in an apartment that smells like rain.  Shucks.  And what.the.fuck is the goddamn deal with all my hot accessories being shoved down to the bottom of the page?!

      Sorry it's taken me so agonizingly long to get around to posting about last night.  I've been busy sleeping in, cleaning the apartment and getting a head start on making up time at the library for being gone this coming Friday.  Whew!     So, about the big show.  Felt pretty good about heading to the Beach all by myself; was looking hot in my new jeans and tight green Banana Republic tank-top...the one that shows off the new Seattle Gap belt oh-so-well.  Did a round of yoga before heading out, too, so was feeling pretty good in my flexible skin.  Took a perch in the bar upstairs and people-watched with the Voice of God for a bit.  Janet didn't arrive until the first set got underway, so I spent quality time with Kathy in the meantime.  We took stock of the crowd (a fairly young one) and I learned that, while I'm not a baby dyke, I do still qualify as 'chicken' because, according to Kathy, I "would be really fun to do."  Always good to know.    As the crowd dispersed at the first show's end, Kathy, Janet and her friend (possibly the messenger?) and I met on the stairs where Kathy hurried through the introductions, on her way to put out some fire or another.  We three secured our beverages and I took another perch overlooking the dancefloor, waiting for them to join me.  The only words we'd exchanged thus far were "Nice to meet you" and I didn't actually know for sure if the TabiKat story was all that credible, so I didn't really feel the need to follow Janet and her friend around...just yet.  Instead, I made sure to stand in clear view of them, leaving plenty of room on either side of me for company.    And sure enough, before long, Janet sidled up next to me and we started chatting.  I have to say, it was really nice to be able to carry on a conversation with someone easily, without worrying about how this flirt came across or whether that was a spark.  There weren't any of  those   sparks to speak of, but that was more of a relief than anything, too.  We talked about the school (she's a UI alum), how the drag shows have changed since her time, law school and law enforcement, the Boise scene, and how 29 is not old.    "I'm 23, and..."    "SEE?  I AM old!!"  "...I feel old in this crowd."  Watching the young things dance and be merry was a good time, I have to say, but seeing the gang of baby dykes I was once drawn to made me chuckle under my breath and shake my head.  So glad I'm not a baby dyke.    But back to the story...after we downed our beers, we ditched Janet's friend (and no, I can't remember her name), who was adamant about her position as wallflower, and hit the dancefloor.  While there was no bump-and-grind action, it was just plain nice to dance with a just plain nice person.  I know it's not flashy or even a bit angsty, but for whatever reason (and probably more than a few of them), I'm just not in the mood for big excitement or gasp-filled stories.  So it was just the perfect thing, really.    Not long after the second show, my reserves were finally giving up, needing another dosage of Vitamin C, and my bed was calling, so I decided to make my exit while I could still be polite and charming.  Being the classy lady I am, I left her with my email address written on a bar napkin.    So yea, not too exciting, but that's just okay.  She wrote me a little email this evening, so I should go see about a reply.  Then I'll finally dig in to Book 5 for the rest of the evening.  If the rumors are true about the book's potency, I may not sleep at all!
