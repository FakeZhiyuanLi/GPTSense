      ei ytyigrd sd uiqfklig pcfg tdyf uiqfkla ueyy al ipyy  There you go. A new code. It was fairly difficult to translate which is why there isn't much of it. It's just a phrase. Tell me the phrase, collect the prize. Asking for clues will decrese the value of the prize. Don't even bother a simple a=1 or a=n(rot 13). Its not that kind of substitution.

      Ok you little bitches. This is what the message said: Ok this is another encrypted message. Obviously. Im super baked right now so I cant really bother to say much. There will be a prize of some sort if you can decrypt this. It wont be crappy I promise. Most likely a graphic novel of some sort. Maybe tickets to AVP. What else? There is only one, first place prize. No others. If you were the second or third person to crack this, sucks to be you.  I guess you weren't ready for that. I'll reuse this in the future so dont even bother asking. Im working an another one so it will be up in a couple days

      I can never decide if I would do it all over. If I had lived my life up to now just a little differently, I wouldn't have a stutter, I wouldn't be worrying about graduating high school, I would be a trustworthy person, I'd have confidence that that I'm a good person, I'd be good at something, ect. But had I done things 'right', I wouldn't be very interesting, people wouldn't be drawn to be around me and my friends, Abby would never have noticed me and on and on and on. It would be so...nice/easy/mentaly relaxing to have never delt with drugs and anger and sadness and&nbsp;mistrust, on that scale. But maybe thats life. Maybe all of that was unavoidable. Maybe I am now better prepared to be independant. I guess even if I could do it all over, I couldn't be much better off.

      Last night was so much fun. Me, Alex, Grey, Nick, Bob, Abby, Nathan, Bryce, and a gazillion girls went drinking at bear creek park. It was so sweet. Ivan showed up. Bryce renounced his Irish heritage. I got super trashed. We spied on some girl and some dude get it on (the dude didn't fucking move. fucking rigid). We ran from cops (I think). A bunch of way cool shit happened. Nick and Bob are possibly the most rockin' guys ever. You cant even explain those kids. Grey and his whole crew are headed up to encampment for&nbsp;two weeks which sucks. He'll be back in the 12 or 13th and&nbsp;I get back from Santa Cruz on the 16th. So much happened that its hard to get it straight so sorry if this is all rambling.   Life feels good. Feels healthy. Feels like I'm doing what I should be doing.   Here's to the homies. Hearts of gold. Live it up. Let the good times roll.

      INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT A jar of salsa is invaded by a large corn chip. Once in the condiment, the corn chip resembles a surfacing shark fin. Fingers poke at it, bringing it to life-swimming menacingly to and fro across the jar.  RANDAL (O.C.) (mumbling Jaws theme) Da-dum! Da-dum! Da-dum! DA-DUM! DA- DUM! DA-DUM!   DANTE and RANDAL are on a freezer case. RANDAL pushes this chip around the jar of salsa. DANTE stares up at the ceiling, oblivious.   RANDAL Salsa shark.   DANTE says nothing.   RANDAL (as Brody) "We're gonna need a bigger boat."   DANTE says even less than nothing.   RANDAL (as Quint) "Man goes into the cage; cage goes into the salsa; shark's in the salsa; our shark."   DANTE...you know.   RANDAL (angry) What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?   DANTE This life.   RANDAL This life?   DANTE Why do I have this life?   RANDAL Have some chips; you'll feel better. 126.   DANTE I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddam steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex-girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.   RANDAL Thirty-seven.   DANTE My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.   CUSTOMER (O.C.) You open?   RANDAL Yeah.   RANDAL hops off the freezer case and steps O.C.   RANDAL (O.C.) That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?   DANTE I was born.   RANDAL comes back.   RANDAL You should shit or get off the pot.   DANTE I should shit or get off the pot.   RANDAL Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.   DANTE What are you talking about?   RANDAL I'm talking about this thing you have...this inability to improve your situation in life. 127.   DANTE Fuck you.   RANDAL It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.   DANTE What responsibility?   RANDAL All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.   DANTE As if it's that easy.   RANDAL It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?   DANTE Leave me alone.   RANDAL You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.   DANTE Oh, like your life's any better?   RANDAL I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.   DANTE Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?   RANDAL It's the same thing with Veronica. 128.   DANTE Leave her out of this.   RANDAL You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!   DANTE Leave me alone.   RANDAL If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...   DANTE ...If I wasn't such a fucking coward. (chuckles) It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.   RANDAL Am I right or what?   DANTE You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.   RANDAL What? The dead guy? She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.   DANTE Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.   RANDAL Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement. 129.   DANTE What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.   RANDAL Make them change.   DANTE I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.   RANDAL Who're you kidding? You can so.   DANTE Jesus H. Christ, I can't!   RANDAL So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?   DANTE (sadly) My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.   RANDAL Lovely story.   DANTE Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.

      I don’t know what to say or what I'm feeling. I don’t feel bad. Stuff has happened the last few days. Its summer. None of it matters. Abby listened to me talk at her for a few hours the other day. It needed to happen. Thanks Abby. Bryce had his first 40 oz. My hatred for individuals has deepened while my hatred for people as a whole has lessened. I got a computer. As odd as it is not feeling great all the time is refreshing if not somewhat relieving. I can’t wait to straighten my head out. I can’t wait to give Abby a great time. I can’t wait for school to start. I never want it to end. AVP will be sweet. Connor should stay away. Jon should stop making people miserable. Alex should stop being paranoid. I should stop worrying about myself. Abby’s wishes should come true. Drugs should mysteriously disappear. Greg should get some sleep. They should make an MVC3. &nbsp;I hope I graduate. I hope there is pasta sauce upstairs. Movies and music will be free. I’m in love.

      Im sort of sick. It sucks. I have a fever of like 99.3 so I'm not dying but I dont feel well. Its annoying cuz I want to go out and do stuff but I dont feel up to it. Crap. I think I'll go out anyway. I was supposed to go drinking but that really would kill me.  &nbsp;  When Bryce got back from Sun Camp or whatever its called I realized how little I knew about Buddhism so I spent a couple hours researching yesterday and have decided that&nbsp;I need to take meditation classes.  &nbsp;  I just made some Annie's and forgot what I was saying.  Have fun.

      Inside we are the patterns emitted from a constant feedback loop. We cannot control who we our to ourselves. There is too much information and too many variables being constantly poured into my head for me to tell myself who I am. We can however, control what we show on the outside. Who we are to other people. How I take the mystery of me on the inside, project it onto a wall for everyone to see, and let their reactions dictate me.&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, people are putrid. I dislike the me who interacts with other people. But I dislike the vast majority of those other people more.&nbsp; It is time for me to reorient. To defrag. To redefine, relationships, fun, everything. The most easily identifiable thing I need to change is my pessimism. I hate people. But&nbsp;I also love people. Love having a good interaction/conversation. Love making someone’s day. Sadly, it is the people I despise who dictate how I interact with the others.&nbsp;Recognizing the good things about a person has been virtually eliminated from me. I see the bad/ugly/dumb. How can I redirect myself to a better place when I am consumed by disgust for other people? I need to focus purely in myself.&nbsp;Ignore all others. Find a good basis for life.

      So much for making a new code. I've been bordering on being sick for the last 4 or 5 days so I haven't done shit. I guess I'll take my computer to Santa Cruz so I can keep up with the happenings and maybe in a moment of free time post something ammusing. You win Abby. You can play Duke Nukem on the plane. I really hope I dont get any sicker. That would blow so much ass. Except that all I would have to do is sit around and play FF: Tactics Advance for 10 days. Thank you so much for letting me borrow that, June.  Once again blogger dispells all my thoughts. There were a few other things I was going to say but whatever.

      Woah. I just woke up from some terrible dreams. Im still sort of shaky. They weren't terrifying or anything but they were stressful and depressing. I'm not even that clear on what happened except that this is the 4th time I was woken up by dreams today/last night. Oh man. Everything feels so wrong at this moment.  I cant wait for Santa Cruz. For the past few weeks all I wanted to do was hang out with Abby but it never happens. Finally, a week where I'll have her all to myself. It sucks though because yesterday I bought all the dankest food on the planet in large quantities but now I have to abandon it all until I get back.  Congratulations to Jessie. She was the first person to figure out the code. It said, "If freedom is outlawed, then only out laws will be free." I owe you something sweet. Maybe I'll find it in Santa Cruz.  Sorry I haven't been updating recently but get used to it. You'll be lucky if there are anymore in the next ten days. I'll try to get a new code posted before I leave.
