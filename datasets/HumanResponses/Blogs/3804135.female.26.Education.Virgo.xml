      for fear for love for the uncertainty of eternity and the  jingling twinklingtoes that danceonthedawn jubilant in the sunshine  for the waters  that never stopped  waving  lullingrolling since the beginning  of time  for the smile pressed to your face by the sway of pinkpetals in the pumpernickel wind  of the bakery  around every corner  for those who look hard enough to believe in a painting’s lush, lurid lay-me-down-to-pick-me-up living layers and  the miniscule moments  of ontopofme orgasms and  calming cockeddangling cigarettes  for the boy in the band loving the girl in pigtails by the water dreaming transcendentalism  cheeseburgers, punk  rock and peace where hearts leapt  through eyes and hands speculating someday san diego  let the love of  twohearts be real and flourish  in skies and eyes and old jeans sagging at the waist, lips parched, soften at the taste  of one soul against another home for a second a while maybe an eternity.

      two sets of lips slinking one  lingerie language  between them or so you’d guess  by listening  but discover electronic distortion-speakers bending the notes to sharp and flat  dissonance amplified the opposite of grace,  polity and wisdom  songs sung the inverse of love but the words were just as charged  four lovinglips spouting hopeful heart-words never got the ears to hear the other’s song  signals switched static won four lips in search of other’s tongues.

      he shaped that pot with his two hard-working tough skin touch-my-face hands  he rounded it and molded it like he rubbed the knots out  of my shoulders and back he pulled at the edges and tugged at my toes shaped the inside and out i can see his fingerprints  that’s the only trace i have his hands  now absent and i still have this pot

      he said burn a candle relax into  its velvetgold flame peacefully exhale your darkness  look up into the cloudful sky cottonwhite  against backdropblue take in the fresh air meditate  under the sistenesky  take a long luscious bike ride into the hills glance at the intimategreen gaze at the grandeur of mother’s tall rooted trees ride into your self  and away from me to let go of the way i  held your heart in mine  to forget me

      an eggshell of the tao resting peacefully while trusting the path  bursts intermittently excavating beliefs with a tongue tasting for truth  axing through the wooden steps  of every foundation searching for the line between  reasonable and not  destroying the roots denying them damning them over the edge of  home  rolling up the edges  and taking the bag  and tonguing around again  for truth as doubt slinks in like a ten dollar whore wearing a red wastebasket and limes  you’ll find me  on a naked wooden porch reconstructing la veritas of the walls:  an egg

      i am from gi. Joe, star wars action figures and barbies without heads i am from a 12 year old girl seeing auras and feeling ghosts i am from “yeah buts live in the woods” and “not me” i am from children fighting caller id for freedom  i am from the spirit in the trees, and basketball hoops that talk back i am from no I in team and soccer pride  i am from catholic guilt and feminist fury i am from the beer and cigarette rebellion i am from jacko’s vineyard and million dollar macaroni, in the early days of bare naked ladies  i am from midnight ramblers and merlot bandits, stealing time for art in a heartbeat and riding off into the sunset to be late for my next scheduled appearance  i am from tight brown dresses and learning to salsa on a dirt floor in cork shoes i am secretly from the cell block tango, all of us with skeletons of our own, that, at times, keep us locked away  i am from what’s that funk in the kitchen? And don’t leave the ice tray half empty  i am from the flowers of flower children, from wordsworth’s plight and emerson’s serenity i am from a generation of activists, searching for a cause and looking inward.  i am from the hearts of folksingers passing out peace and love lollipops on street corners and in cafes, baptizing us with the sunshine in front of our eyes  i am from a conscripted vietnam vet, who grieves janis joplin like a sister i am from the unique strength of Her, a giver of second chances, always seeing the good, and praying it will come i am from goddesses who shall mother the world all over again with careful and deliberate hands  i am from the pain of my sisters as we move on, together, stitching and patching each other, lending hands and shoulders, and handing out hope chocolate to keep on keepin on  i am from ayjadamunjba, and other grandmother slang i am from turning the other cheek and psychology  i am from church choirs, jesus lovers, birth controllers and controversies i am from kick boxing for my life  i am from two landmarks and a roomful of rocks i am from all of the pieces of all the hearts that I touch and love and savor on my way
