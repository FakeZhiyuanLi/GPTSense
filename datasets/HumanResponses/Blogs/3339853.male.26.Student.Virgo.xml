      After 2 hour french class, The prof. called me right on the spot. For what?. It was simple. I however guessed why. She prepared one good and warm book for me. What does this mean?. Humm,, Such a good woman,,, I wonder if she is married..  Exactly four or five weeks ago, I asked her of what french grammar book would help me improve my french comprehension and she tipped me off a bit saying she would let me know right next week. And so far there have not been any news from her on my demand but today she broke the silence. And I thanks her for the book she herself bought for me. How grateful am I... I felt real affection and such an encouraging feeling that no one else ever has made me feel.   I will never ever forget what she did to me. Great. Just great.  Now, I'm here at the computer room they say. I dug up French grammar for about 2 hours before and crawled myself into this room to hear Federal News Radio which is the internet radio broadcasting from the United States and they keep me updated about what is going on around the world with Ap network news and other reports. Also they are my pipelines to the source of both the domestic news in the US and international affairs in which I have much interest. Though The news they are sending over the net may not affect my daily life, I feel much privileged , I dont know why.. I shall not feel this way.. Probably I'm still living here in Korea where English is never spoken openly.

      Today,   Before my presentation on Street food and fast food in the Philippines, I think I'd better tell you a little about what I'm going to talk about in brief.   First, I will tell you about what is street food. But here I will not pay attention to Fast food since it is well known to everyone and I do not think it is necessary for me to bring it up here.  And Next is street food in the Philippines based on which I choosed from the internet.  And importantly, Balut.   Then I will move on to cultural factors that explain why street food in the Philippines is so popular there.  And I prepared all four reasons here.   Okay, Let me begin here.  What is street food ?. Street food is the food that is sold and eaten on the street as you read the paper I handed.  And especially in the Philippines, It plays one of the important roles in the life and culture of the Philippines and We certainly realize how important it means to the Filipinos.    I can make it much easier to understand by taking the case here in Korea. When you walk along the street in downtown Seoul, You never miss those street vendors right on each side of the street. You can see they sell all kinds of things from electric gadgets to food we rarely cook at home. Those food smell good and spicy , looking red or not surely attract us.   And let me take a look at street food in the philippines. ~~~~~~~   Balut is a A specialty of the Philippines - "a fertilized duck's egg, boiled and eaten by cracking the wide end, making a hole, sipping the broth, and then cracking the whole open to savor the red yolk and the tiny chick inside. The perfect balut, to the Filipino, is 17 days old, at which stage the chick is still wrapped in white and does not show beak or feathers   And cultural factors that make it so special are four reasons picked up from the book.  You may better understand what all those four facts are all about if you read the textbook.  well, I will sum up those ideas.   First reason for what is taking place in the case of popularity of street food in the Philippines is about the Filipino meal. They have three meals a day and these give them considerable time and space to enjoy eating inside and outside. And Meals at home extend to yard or street( too many guests or not enough rooms ), which is never unusual or strange. So does the restaurant and the public.   Second is about a concept of meals as stopping points. I think it has more to do with pastime during which we bite some snacks. In the philippines, there is small meal called " pangtawid gutom " between major meals  and People snack   Third one is the Filipino idea of community. Rice is the staple food in the Philippines and they all work hard to maintain their life. For this, Community means a lot.  They need to plant and plough together to make the best use of their efforts to get more products when it is ripe.  And This togetherness links each other strongly and by which they naturally find a place to sit and chat sharing food, idea and many others. This place enables people to eat outside without any hesitation.   The last reason, Food sellers' extention.   Food seller's role changed and they bring food to where it is in need. This means that people can have food easily. And street food began in the same manner.

      Upon cruising the net carelessly, I bumped into a web site posted and run by a guy from America. there I could glimpse at a bunch of pictures he took in the Phillipines and here South Korea.   And Second thought was emerging .. Suddenly my own blogspot crossed my shaky mind. And I acted upon things I wanted to do.   To leave my footsteps here I choosed and they will all one day remaind me of days gone. Recent days, I really feel like the other person who is quite different from who I was months ago. Maybe nothing really has changed dramatically so far and just I become restless. this is the only why I'm so depressed. But I can't tell which or what is right or how to straighten out problems appearing day by day.   Today anyhow is the day I built my own world here in the internet.  Revolutionized world I live in and renders me split into several personal characters, which I did not mean in the first place.

      When a little, I supposed everything would remain just the same as always. Parents, friends, and other people I know.. I thought, they would all survive throughout years. At that time, I was so un prepared to face anything going against my will and expectation. I cried loud and relied on family for support.  Now Time changes and ages, I realize one true fact with harsh reality. That time never awaits me but punishes me causing however, unbearable pain this life I've been leading.   Last night was more than a tragedy, I was so scared and angered.  I hated everything save nothing. I could not find any proper reason for this falling.   He complained a healthy problem. The doctor he consulted warned him of some worst possibility in the future. But He was helpless and me either. Money seems to revenge this life.  He cannot get any costly medical treatment ..nope.. He does not want to.. because it will, he think, only burden his family heavily. The truth is not at all for I and all of my family are so desperate in saving him... But He thinks too much. He sure thinks the way he now practices is correct for people around him..   I heard of a word of his despair. I felt totally overwhelmed with pouring tears and relentless feelings tearing me apart. I'm now devastated in mind. I'm helpless.. and discouraged ... depressed by cruelties inflicted upon my home.. just like a curse that is to take someone's life away by and by after causing him or her growing agony heartlessly. which only fate can plot...   I'm so Sad but laugh though. My tears drained. Words found no meaning. I'm so afraid ...... feared....
