      damn i cant seem to sing properly in front of people.. like i just now.. alex was playing the guitar.. he played.. can't stop.. whereever you will go and under the bridge.. and every time i couldnt sing the way i normally do.. (normal is good heh).. i dont think i can really put enough emphasis but just standing/sitting still... need to move around and really throw my voice at it.. then it sounds all funky.. hmm maybe ill get used to it.. like sooooooon.. anyway.. off for driving lesson now.. post later..

      Woohoo.. last exam was today.. pure maths 2.. i think it went better than i thought.. evne without doing a single bit of revision.. not good enough thou.. prob got like a D but thats not the point.. yea today was cool.. weather was shit thou.. didnt get a chance to play footy.. hmmmm "trying" to get some drums.. but without much luck.. sang a song or two with nish and alex today.. was good.. heard toby too.. his singing is good.. he can sing in tune..sure he can sing but i dont think he has that singer's voice.. sometimes he sounds like he's got something stuck in this throat.. oh well.. was fun anyway.. i think im gonna try to learn a song everyday on my guitar.. i can nearly play and sing at the same time... Stereophonics - Have A Nice Day.. im really enjoying my guitar now that i can pick up stuff much easier.. it shows with enough patience.. you can do anything.. its just the start which is hard.. oh well.. betta go clean up my room.. and cant wait till chillis on friday!!

      Letter received:  Dear No.5  Over the last few days I have noticed that music is being played from one your bedrooms.  This seems to be taking place in the afternoons for several hours  (umm no! not hours) .  I am currently revising  bla dee bla de bla..  as a fellow neighbour I would appreciate it if you could lower the volume of the music, I am finding they are disturbing my concentration which in turns make it diffucult to revise.   Regards No.12.  -Well must of been pretty loud if he could hear it from there. I was listening to the Chillis!
