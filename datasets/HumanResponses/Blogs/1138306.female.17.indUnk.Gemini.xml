      Beauty queen of only eighteen She had some trouble with herself He was always there to help her She always belonged to someone else  I drove for miles and miles And wound up at your door I've had you so many times but somehow I want more  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful I know I tend to get so insecure It doesn't matter anymore  It's not always rainbows and butterflies It's compromise that moves us along My heart is full and my door's always open You can come anytime you want  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  I know where you hide Alone in your car Know all of the things that make you who you are I know that goodbye means nothing at all Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved  [in the backround] Please don't try so hard to say goobye Please don't try so hard to say goobye  Yeah [softly] I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain  Try so hard to say goobye

      Tell me where i’m Supposed to begin An unhappy life working Some kind of dead end job For everything you thought you had Has gone from worse to bad  Lean to the side Whisper it quiet The end is in sight to working All night around the clock For everything you thought you had Has gone from worse to bad  But it’s not my kind of scene oh yeah Footprints on the other side Remind me where I’ve been oh yeah I’ll watch from the other side  Tell me where i’m Supposed to begin Move out of sight and onto Some life I’m dreaming of For everything you thought you had Has gone from worse to bad So I’ll just wait and watch the wheels While you’re turning back  But it’s not my kind of scene oh yeah Footprints on the other side Remind me where I’ve been oh yeah I’ll watch from the other side  Pulls me over and it drags me under Pulls me over and it drags me under Alright now alright now

      I can't remember when it was good moments of happiness in bloom maybe I just misunderstood all of the love we left behind watching our flash backs intertwine memories I will never find inspite of whatever you become forget that reckless thing turned on I think our lives have just begun  I think our lives have just begun  and I'll feel my world crumbling down feel my life crumbling now feel my soul crumbling away falling away falling away with you  staying awake to chase a dream tasting the air you're breathing in I hope I won't forgot a thing I wish to hold you close and pray watching our fantasies decay nothing will ever stay the same and all of the love we threw away and all of the hopes we've cherished fade making the same mistakes again  making the same mistakes again  and I'll feel my world crumbling down feel my life crumbling now feel my soul crumbling away and falling away falling away with you  all of the love we left behind watching our flash backs intertwine memories I will never find memories I will never find

      there's a part in me you'll never know the only thing I'll never show  hopelessly I'll love you endlessly hopelessly I'll give you everything but I won't give you up I won't let you down and I won't leave you falling If the moment ever comes  It's plain to see it's trying to speak cherished dreams forever asleep hopelessly I'll love you endlessly hopelessly I'll give you everything but I won't give you up I won't let you down and I won't leave you falling if the moment ever comes  hopelessly I'll love you endlessly hopelessly I'll give you everything but I won't give you up I won't let you down and I won't leave you falling but the moment never comes
