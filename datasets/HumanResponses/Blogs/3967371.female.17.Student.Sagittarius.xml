       Waiting for Waiting for the night to change your ways There are days missing from my week again And there's not a cloud in the sky But my view from the Hollywood Roosevelt Makes me feel like I can fly I should maybe make some apologies And I probably should fix my hair But I might just stay another night If my credit card's still down there Oh yeah, all right I feel like a hundred million dollars tonight I knew you were the one But I kept you waiting Kept you waiting Anticipating now I'm waiting for you I think I'll go see my friends tonight Who live just a little bit up Crescent Heights And sometimes we stay out all night Feels like there's nothing that we can't do I'm never really sure that I'll ever change But if it makes you happy then I will lie She looked at me and softly said I'm going to love you till the day I die Oh yeah, all right I feel like a hundred million dollars tonight I knew you were the one But I kept you waiting Kept you waiting Anticipating now I'm waiting for you I miss the things you told me I'll be waiting for you I just wish you would hold me I'll be waiting for you If you decide to change your mind I'll be waiting for you I miss the things you told me I'll be waiting for you I'll be waiting there for you waiting there for you waiting there for you waiting there for you I keep waiting anticipating you   It's a song by Sugar Ray that made me drown in my thoughts today... hehehe...

       Dreams... dreams... inconsistent angel things. Horses bred with star laced wings. But it's so hard to make them fly.     &nbsp;   I dreamt I was leaving by ship. As I was preparing to leave, I saw a Maroon5 truck parked in front of my house. I saw Adam Levine walk out with spotlights hovering onto him. I think I shouted... "I love you ADAM!"     &nbsp;   I still have it with the Maroon 5 fevah...      &nbsp;   Then, as I was leaving, I was sitting in a cocoon. It was supposed to be my cabin. I ouldn't quite understand what was under my cocoon... sand or cement. It felt like cement but it was supposed to be sand. Then the cocoon flipped. I went out and told my mom, while holding the cocoon in my hands... THIS SIMPLY CAN'T work. Then I woke up realizing that I'm late.     &nbsp;   Now, it's free cut again. hehehe. I can't just quite imagine why our teacher won't teach us... I think he's on extended vacation... He earned it anyway handling little demons like us...&nbsp;grin again.     Anyway, I want to tell about my new installation on my write-on journal. Extremely random thoughts, fiction writing using a first person's POV... a story of my future self... my future rich self to be exact. grin    I'll type it down when I have time... If I get at it... (wink wink)          &nbsp;

       Tarantado talaga yung tarantadong yun. He had the nerve to tell me that I'm pathetic and I'm arrogant. Why am I so affected by the way?    &nbsp;  Eversince gradeschool, galit saken lahat ng tao. That's why I had to de-pollute my personality buong HS life ko. Ngayon, eveil spirits had been awakened kaya asar na asar ako.    &nbsp;  Pati nanay ko inaway ko kaninang umaga. Lalang.    &nbsp;  The thing is, my dad gave me a lecture. (In short, hindi nya ako ba-back-up-an sa problemang ito) He told me of the difference between men's and women's worlds. Sa loob loob ko lang, I'll make these two, so called, worlds one if need be. I'm surprised that I was suddenly blasted back from the 50's. Parang hindi ko matake yung fact na I have to bow down to males... Try me!    &nbsp;  wala lang.....    &nbsp;

      My first entry again. Dalawa blog ko nyahahaha!  urlLink www.livejournal.com/~orangepesky  yung isa... bahala na... hehehehe Let us first start with a dream. It's a trifle queer ne? That I dreamt of a wedding when I wanted to die last night (for further infomation click on the livejournal link up thur). Trifle queer too that the moiff was creamy white and soft blue. If I remember correctly I removed the colors blue and white from my motiff list for my own wedding... (Current favorite colors: orange and gold.. nyahahaha!) But the weirdest element in the story is that the groom is B. Remark: He's out of my bishboy list.  But last night, I was pondering about love and it was the first time in, at least, half a year I prayed. I prayed for love... Then I got that gift... His way of saying... He... (not B) may not be for you... Should I wait? hmmm... Siguro nga...

      Tinuruan ko yung kapatid ko ngayon. I never thought that at that age, impossible din pala akong turuan... tsk tsk tsk... Eniwei... I just wanted to say something about the finality of my stand against falling into dangerous situations... an insight given to me by LP.  There are things in life I chose to do not because I wanted to do it for the sake of me but because I wanted to do it for the sake of certain OTHERS. This acts for others thing is not your usual MAN FOR OTHERS atenean deed... no. I try to find my own satisfaction by seeing other people being satisfied with the things I do or do not do... In short, I had lived to please others... I had lived for others neglecting the ME part of my life.  I had lived the life of a bitch who I swore that I will never become. I had ceased to become me...  Anlabo  Kase ganito... mahal ko sya... Dahil mahal ko sya... sinusubukan kong ibahin ang buhay ko... dahil sa kagustuhin kong ibahin ang buhay ko... hindi ko alam na kung ano ang dapat kong buhay. Don't satrt with "Ask help from the Lord!" We had made a pact that we'll just let everything take its course so he would not interfere with my life... My achievements and failures will be my doing... We'll just settle scores later... ha?  Sorry ha... gabi na kase... I have to be in full study mode tom and i was in full study mode kagabi until 3 ng hapon kanina... So technically, wala pang ayos ang utak ko.  Let me go back to the mahal ko sya part... Dati yun... aftermath na yung hindi ko na maintindihan yung sarili ko. Ngayon, I'm in the state of pagsasawa. Pano ko nasabi yun? nawawala na PATI yung frustration ko... Dati nawala yung hapiness ko... ngayon... peti frustration na... In short, he starts to be just a regular guy walking around the campusjust for the sake of existing... He has ceased to be my life...  Pathetic noh?  Basta yun... Yun na... tulog na ako... pramis bukas ulit... pero kelangan kong magprogram at magaral!!! Sa tuesday nalang after ng psych test ko... sob

       Sullen faces yet to be erased                    Worries yet to be forgotten   In a search for scientific knowledge            I was kissed by the muse of wisdom   It is this music that rings in my ear                             This rhythm that takes away my rhythm   This promise that she will be loved               It bothers me so   It is his voice I hear                     He sings to me softly   Just behind my shoulder                  Though, if it is song heartfelt   Or a blatant ridicule                      Light was not shed   The she whom he pertains to                  Still remains unknown   Is it me or is it another                 The mind says   "Woman cover thine ears                          And protect thine heart!"   It is only now did I consider concede               Why must I, for so long, hope   When I knew that I had no hope                                 Why must I, for so long, love   When I knew no love was meant for me                           Why must I, for so long, stand in the rain   When the sun is waiting just beyond the clouds                                      When the song can be stopped   And my life can finally continue.

         It's been a while since I wrote in this little hidey hole of mine. I just realized that other journals are full of hustles and bustles of other kids commenting on the life or the thoughts of people responsible for the said journal. I am pretty contented here, sitting quietly in one corner, writing my thoughts... seriously.          I realized that my written journal is, more or less, 25 pages short before completion... In short, I'm running out of pages. Grin...          It's Tuesday and I'm supposed to writing about trivial, nonsense stuff but I am sitting here listening to my mother and her best friend talk about the family crisis.          I have qualms about my father and everyone knows that. He has been the thorn in this family for a long time whether my mother admits it or not. Now, he's in some kind of trouble that leaves me absolutely baffled about who is right.          There is this guy,  Lemuel,  who was a long time friend of my mother. Last week, my other recieved a document stating that that, so called, "friend" filed a case against them, accusing them that my mom and my dad borrowed Php 400,000 from him... the details I do not know. But here is one thing that caught me... He accused my om for ENTICING him to get in the deal.       There is a thing however with money inside the house... My father NEVER shares his money.   Sure there is such a thing as conjugal property but with my family, THAT IS NOT THE CASE. Which means that whatever my dad "borrowed",    IF HE BORROWED   , my mother had nothing to do with it.       It is not the fact that we, suposedly, OWED money. It was the fact that he accused my mother...   THE NERVE OF THAT FUGLY PERSON  !!!       Now, let me talk of the lighter stuff. Today is a Tuesday which implies that it's Psychology day which implies it is  Kirby DAY!       Wahahahaha! nyahahah! Which means I am in love! crap!       Anyway, I started this whole painting thing yesterday. I plan to paint thoughts that I have at the moment. The thing is, I plan to make it permutatable. The edges will be continuous however you turn it, however you arrange it. I would be starting with two canvases. The dimensions are in my notebook. I plan to make lots of those so that it can cover one whole wall. But then again, I have to find a way to mount and hang it if I plan to make it a mural...... too much work... oh well... let me figure that when time comes.      Now, the dimensions of the painting will be according to the golden ratio.      By the way, about the golden ratio, I just realized something:        Suppose x and y are real numbers in such a way that x/y = phi; x>y and x1+x2=x and x1/x2=phi; x1>x2, you will realize that more or less: x1=y.   I still have to prove this though... grin...      Anyway, I have to go home now... I know that was pretty boring... hehehe...bear with me... my wits are absent today... as with every day of the week last week... hehehehe...
