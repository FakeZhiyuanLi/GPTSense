      My original Ragnarok account has no game time left but I managed to lvl up my swordie up to level 30 today.  I was supposed to meet Zane at chaos server though.  I got out of the house carrying 25 pesos and ended up here with 48... cool huh?  Anyway this week is so darn boring... I know it isn't over yet but I expect the rest of the week to be as dull as a noontime drama series shown on local tv networks... and HBO ain't even putting anything good on teh screen.

      I managed to find some money left in my wallet after going to Baguio... 70 pesos, I think I'm gonna spend it all on making testimonials and updating my blog.  I wish I have at least two hours of gaming time, so I could change my thief into an assassin.  Last day was very boring, i'm just sitting all day long in front of tv watching scripted wrestling scenes that does'nt even qualify as "realistic" (I wonder how they avoid having bruises and bloody noses after that amount of "punishment").  My younger brother just changed his magician to a wizard last tuesday and that made me so envious... And worse, I can't even contact Zane since I ran out of load last night (ugh that was like, so darn lame).  Anyway I think that's it for now, I have yet to unravel blog's full potential (pardon the pun).

      I finally got a hold of a pc after some weeks of boredom (congratulate me!!!)!  I also got hold of a simple yet addictive rpg game.  Its graphics aren't that flashy but the gameplay does more than make up for it, plus its extra low system requirements makes it possible for even the outdated ones to play it.  It's called the earth lords and it really rocks!  I'm gonna attend victory weekend this friday... hm... wonder if anything extraordinary will happen there.
