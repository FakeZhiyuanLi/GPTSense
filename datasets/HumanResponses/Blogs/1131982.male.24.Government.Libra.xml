       Plot:  I guess Marvel is going to relaunch the Invaders   Review:  Chuck Austen = shit.  I'm still buying it like JLA, but I'm not reading it either.  It's downright silly.  There is no rhyme or reason as to why the Avengers would give a flying crap about a woman who died in the crossfire.  Would they be sad?  Yes.  Would they be guilt ridden?  Yes.  Would they take her children into Avenger's Mansion? NO!  Would they make a statue honoring the woman?  NO!  Should Chuck Austen never work in comics again?  YES!  And the art is shitty too. Just a few more months till Bendis...   Rating:  F

       Plot:  Superman's a vampire and the JLA is fighting a devil cult or something.   Review:  I've been buying it for this Claremont! and Byrne! run, but I haven't read it.  Because it's been absolute shit.  Sorry, can't put it any more eloquently than that.   Rating:  F

       Plot:  A wrap-up to the 'Hollywood' storyline and all about Peter Parker.   Review:  This issue proves once again how much Bendis must hate, HATE, secret identities.  Mary Jane knows.  Doc Ock knows.  The Green Goblin knows.  The Green Golbin's kid knows.  SHIELD knows.  The Ultimates know.  And now Gwen Stacy knows.  I'm was starting to lose that feeling of suspended disbelief and then this happens: So it's Gwen, Peter, and Mary Jane all chilling on Spider-man's bed, and Peter doesn't have one thought about the possible "ramifications" of that.  That killed me.  He lives with a hot girl.  He dates a hot girl.  They both know he is a SUPERHERO and there is not one thought balloon about hanky-panky?  Did that spider bite chemically castrate him as well?  Next Issue: Carnage.  Whoop-de-freakin-do!   Rating:  C+

       Plot:  Bats, Supes, and Wondy try to figure out what to do with Kara Zor-El, Kal-El's cousin.  Or is she...   Review:  Okay we get it Michael Turner, you can draw hot chicks.  Staged where ever it is the Amazons live, The Holy Trinity of the DCU get ambushed by a bunch of Dommsday clones.  Yes, that Doomsday.  Batman and Wonder Woman are paranoid, Superman is over-protective, and at the end, it is off to Apkolips to face Darkseid.  Lots of Amazonian ass shots, and wide eyed blonde chicks.  Other than that, nothing that couldn't have been done in the previous issues.  Stretching out this storyline to make plenty of room for Michael Turner's artwork has made a weak premise weaker, and further leads me to the conclusion that NO ONE knows what to do with Superman mythos lately.

       Plot:  Alcatraz reopens for super-villians, and two of them aren't showing up right, but mostly an administrative issue for the team.   Review:  And by administrative, I mean status quo.  Arsenal's benefactor shows up, shrouded in mystery.  Metamorpho 2.0 changes into Shift (not bad).  Huntress leaves and warns Arsenal about Nightwing's emotional intrest in the team.  Two robots explode.  But it works.  Winick proves once again how hip he is by dropping smart, witty dialouge in a script that feels action packed, but kind of isn't at the same time.  The art, however, while effectively telling the story, is ugly and muddled, and lacks the polish of the previous artist.  The book really isn't about high emotional drama, a change from most teambooks.  It has personnel drama, but it is mostly about action and funny one-liners.  It reminds me of TV's Angel in that respect.  When something big happens, it is BIG.  But for the most part, it's about whupping ass.   Rating:  B+

       Plot:  Get Raven out of Brother Blood's fortress, and watch out for Deathstroke and his daughter.   Review:  I was really hyped by the new Teen Titans, and I have really liked every issue of the relaunch... except this one.  Actually, this whole "Get Raven" storyline has left me sour, as it is set deep in DC Comics mythology, that frankly, I don't know very much about.  Every single time I see a Brother Blood story, they are rebuilt to the particular writers wishes, so I really can't see why the revelations about the cult here actually matter.  The former Young Justice half of the Titans are left to the back burner here, save Robin (Tim Drake), and with the deep backstory between the Titans, Deathstroke, Deathstroke's kids, Raven, Starfire, and Garth (who looks silly when in non-animal form) it was hard to really care about what was going on.  Plus, when they do highlight Robin, he says things like, "Normally I wouldn't hit someone younger than me, but you really need a spanking."  Ugh.   Rating:  C-

       Plot:  "Cops" meets X-Men starring future cop mutant Bishop.   Review:  I've always dug Bishop, and I'm happy to see a gimmick for him that will actually work.  This issue, however, stars Ismael, the human who gets assigned to work with Bishop as they go through the streets of District X, a mutant ghetto in Manhattan.  Ismael is originally paired with your standard minority hating cop Gus, who isn't exactly thrilled with working in District X, and considers it a place of trash and mutant excrement.  Ismael seems a bit more compassionate, albeit, to a fault, when he helps cover up when his partner Gus screws up a domestic abuse call.  David Hine and David Yardin set an effective pace and style in the book, saving the superhero money shot for the last page.  This first issue has really set my expectations high for this book, and I can't wait to see if someone is actually able to make Bishop cool again.    Rating:  B+

      Plot: Tim Drake gives up the mantle of Robin.  The Spoiler becomes new Robin.  Review:  First of all, I love Tim Drake, so the idea of him NOT being Robin bothers me.  But Bill Willingham is a good writer, and he has included Tim into the pages of this book, while the new Robin wears the red, gold, and green.  I haven't read this book in years, and when I had stopped, the Spoiler wasn't so... childish.  She was pregnant and had had a baby, so seeing her act very "girly-girl" was very surprising.  This launching point for the title introduces new penciler Damion Scott, who despite a few layout hiccups here and there, certainly impresses with clean and cartoony artwork.    But like I said, I love Tim Drake, and so this will be a tough sell to me in future issues.  And it is not even mentioned how the new "civilian" Tim Drake is going to handle The Teen Titans either, which is a DC flagship right now.  This is a major detail, and it hurt my opinion of the book.  Rating: B

         Plot:  The origin continues for Jason Rusch as he struggles with the local Detroit hoods, and the abilities of Firestorm.   Review:  Pretty interesting stuff.  I don't have a lot of interest invested in the Firestorm character, so the changes in persona and powers don't really tie me up in bunches, and it is all pretty fun.  From what I know of the old Firestorm, it was a form that was shared between a codgy old professor and some random teenager.  Now, it looks like the powers will be shared with Jason, and whoever happens to be next to him.  Luckily, a little to luckily for suspension of disbelief's sake, the unintended partner forgets all that has happened.  I am interested in what has become of the old Firestorm, and how exactly these powers ended up in front of a barn in Detroit, but so far nothing on that.  I've been a fan of CrissCross's work since the ill-fated Slingers, and I am happy to see him work on something promising again.  Props to DC for letting them take a fan favorite like this and A) Completely rewriting him from the ground up, and B) Making him black.  When this origin arc ends, I want to see if they will keep the character in Detroit, and how exactly the characterize the city.  A great start so far.   Rating:  B+

         Plot:  First issue of the Joss Whedon era of the X-men.  The roster drops to five as Scott Summers resolves to make the team a bonafide super team, complete with colorful spandex.   Review:  I'm digging it all so far, but then again, I've got a man-crush on Joss Whedon's work, and I am developing another crush on john Cassaday's work too.  It is a return to some older ideas about the X-men.  Scott vs. Logan, a mutant cure, Kitty Pryde, and the Danger Room all return to the spotlight, but with the added bonus of witty dialogue, great characterization, and some fantastic artwork.  My favorite part?  "Superpowers, a scintillating wit, and the best body money can buy... and I still rate below a corpse."  -The White Queen    Rating:  A-

         Plot:  Part one in a series that will bring about the Ultimate version of Carnage.  While Bendis stretches out the eventual reveal of Carnage, Spider-man visits yet another person who knows who he really is, Dr. Curt Conners.     Review:  In what is becoming more and more formulaic in Ultimate Spider-man new villains, we don't actually see the thing, just a vague set-up.  We do get to see the first steps of Dr. Conners inevitable breakdown, but whether or not he becomes Carnage is yet to be seen.  I never really liked Carnage, however, so I hope this isn't as drug out as the last arc.  The art?  Bagley shines as always.   Rating: B-

         Plot:  Still in the first arc, we find out what Kiden was up to the past few months.  And that the girl who may or not be Wolverine's daughter didn't kill that guy.   Review:  After waiting ump-teen months for a new release from this promising title, I must say how utterly disappointed I am with this issue.   Very little happened.  I mean,  nothing  happened.  Two girls sat in a diner, and listened to a third girl talk about being homeless.  But  God  does it look fantastic.  Middleton suffers from incredible talent that just cannot be rushed, and should not be substituted.  But the story has got to back up the wait, and this issue was lacking one.  It'll fit in okay when this first arc is packed into a graphic novel, but on its own it falls flat.  A shame, because I really like the concept for the book.   Rating: C-

         Plot:  JLA vs. Vampires?   Review:  Well, we have finally came to the conclusion of 'The Tenth Circle' which has really been a demonstration of how far comics and its creators have come.  I know these little throwbacks to old creators please alot of the older fans, who mistakingly believe that the 'Dark Phoenix Saga' is the greastest stroy ever told, but to me, its pure annoyance.  The JLA was created to be  the  action title for DC; a place for the best and brightest in the DCU to whoop-ass, save the day, and look pretty as hell doing it.  For a team that that has bested white martians, Starro, and a host of other big bads, a few vampires seem a little too small fry.  Plus, nobody looked pretty doing it.  A spectacular faliure to hold my intrest, the final issue of this Claremont, Byrne, and Ordway proved once again how archic the comics of old can be, and why we must constantly push for this industry to try new things, and forget the ways of old. P.S.  There was a huge error in this issue in the coloring department.  Check it out!     Rating:  F

      WTF ever happened to NYX, your story about NYC teens discovering their mutant abilities, especially one of those teens who may or may not be Wolverine's daughter?

      Please do not worry, I still plan on reviewing books... I guess I'm still waiting for something really worth writing about.  I really crapped on the last batch of titles (deservingly so) and the stuff I have gotten since then hasn't really set me off. On the sidebar, I have added a list of my monthly reads, and when they impress or really depress me, I'll throw up a review.  In the meantime, I'll be reconsidering this site an all encompassing reviews site, including electronics, movies, the web, TV, and print.  So look for a change in name, look, and url on the horizon.

      Bruce Jones, current Hulk writer and s-l-o-w-e-s-t story teller ever, has now become a DC exclusive writer.  Good for him, I can't wait to see what elese he can do.  So now all the fanboys are clamoring for a return 90's Hulk ala the great Peter David.  I love Peter David's Hulk.  I got into the game much later than everyone else and I still loved Peter David's Hulk.  But I don't want to see him return.  Why? 1.  I'm about 25 issues off from completeing his previous run and don't want to add to that. 2.  I'm all about change.  Keep things moving and I'm afraid Peter might drop back to his old Hulk form.  Plus, another title in his life could mess up the seemingly great (sorry Pete, haven't gotten to it yet) Fallen Angel.  Pete had nine years on the Hulk, and tons of great memories and fun were created from that run.  Let's move on.

       T'Challa &nbsp;   End of an era. At least for me...  Yesterday, Shannon got off work early, and went to the comic book store while waiting for me to get off the clock at my job.  She brought home a few of our monthlies, and one of those books was Black Panther #62.  The last issue of the one book that kept me into comics.  I can't really produce why I wanted out of comics in the first place.  It was around the time when  urlLink Marvel  was bouncing back bankruptcy.  New blood was flooding into Marvel, with stacks of new, fresh, and exciting ideas.  And I had had enough of them.  Nothing was really getting me excited about comics; my current stack of monthlies was undergoing creative changes that almost all sucked.  Not in the fanboy, "They changed the costume!  Worst comic ever," but in the, "Wow, this sucks," kind of way.    Marvel Knight hit and I was into Smith's Daredevil, and nothing much else.  But I was turned onto Black Panther by a friend who said it was great and fell in love.  Within the first page, I realized that  urlLink Priest  was writing this book, who wrote another favorite of mine, Quantum and Woody.  So for awhile, everyone I knew was reading Black Panther, until issue 6.  Then the book got difficult to read.  My friends were confused, I was confused, I think all the fill-in artists were confused because the book was a hodge-podge of bizarre story-telling techniques.  Mike Manley, one time artist of Darkhawk, really sucked, and a lot of people jumped ship.  I didn't.  I read, and reread the storyline, Enemy of the State, because it was fantastic.  I HAD to understand it.  I HAD to get all of the references.  I HAD to get all of the jokes.  And I never let the book go again.  But I'm in the minority.  Sales slumped and the book is officaily cancelled.  Of course, there is the Crew, but that’s another story.  But much like the other big cancellations in my life, Darkhawk, New Warriors, Quantum and Woody, a monthly inspiration for me is gone.  I think about writing comics all of the time, and every time I have an idea I compare it to the great-ness those books have risen to in my mind.  But inspiration sometimes fail me, and what worries me about this cancellation of a comic book, comes the fear that a cancellation of my creativity may go with it.  I still have all of my dreams and hopes I entered adulthood with, but now I have reasons why they can't happen.  Why they wouldn't happen.  Why they shouldn't happen.  My fears no longer exist only in conversations over coffee, but in subconscious failure techniques that are bound to bloom once more as another semester of higher education looms.  Long live T'Challa...

       My Rant about Gmaecube @ EGM Boards &nbsp;    Here it is:  While respecting Nintendo's willingness and drive to design new ways for us to play thier games, I don't like the way it has all turned out.  I bought the GC because I enjoy thier franchises (Zelda, Metroid) and I was hopeful that thier future strategies would include other types of gaming I enjoy (online, rpg, fighting, puzzle) but they have not yet lived up to my hopes.  Instead, they seem to obsess over this GBA/GC link in the hopes that someone like me will go out and grab the GBA or GC.  I don't like that.  I don't like the e-reader either.  I don't like lack of two player support with GB Player.  As a fan and consumer, I feel Nintendo has let me down in providing me with MY gaiming needs.  So I am considering a new system.  I'm a one system guy cause I don't have much money.  I regret my decision to purchase a GC, even though I loved Zelda, Metroid, Animal Crossing, Pikmin, and a few third party games here and there.    Point is, Nintendo made alot of promisies with the GC and it hasn't really lived up to any of them.  So my patience with them and thier connectivity gimmicks are up.  Maybe I am a fool for not realzing it earlier, but that doesn't mean Nintendo is any less to blame for not living up the this long time fans expectations.

I just feel like I would be doing a grand diservice to myself if I followed through with Poli Sci.  I just need a higher level of creativity in my life, and I suppose work too.  But I am afraid because of my age, and the amount of schooling I have in front of me anyway.  Everyone says its okay, but I can't help but beat myself up over it all.

       Tall of Two Cities &nbsp;   Got back from DC late last night, and promptly went to bed for this mornings' work.  This long weekend was my first trip to Washington DC, and certainly the first time I have ever been someplace I would actually want to live.  I am unsure whether a desire to live in the capital is based on how effin’ cool that city is, or how un-effin’ cool Detroit is.  As I learn and grow older, I find less and less reason to say in this pit of mindlessness, carelessness, and corruption.  No one cares.  Oh sure, we would all love to see a resurgence in this once(?) proud city, but in the end, everyone is too lazy, or to burned out to do anything to help the process.  Detroit celebrated a 300 year birthday last year.  This year it celebrated the nation’s first “ urlLink hip-hop mayor ” by whacking him with a drunk-driving-stripper scandal, while the city’s police force were described by the Justice department as the  urlLink worst it has ever seen .  Most men want to be Vin Diesel, while the others are soooo punk even they forgot where the underground scene was.  Most girls are hootchie-mamas, just waiting in line at the club to get pregnant.  Shannon is the only one I can truly identify with.  But she is the only one in a metro of millions, and sadly, she’s not enough.  I love blue-collar people for their humor and never ending struggle against the odds.  I hate them for their obesity, stupidity, flag waving, gun loving, Channel 7 watching, swerving in out of lanes without a blinker, cars, and Budweiser.  But I mostly hate them because everytime I look in the mirror, I look more and more like them.

       Types &nbsp;   Before my rant, here is a quick update. 1.  B-52's sucked.  SUCKED!  Sound was off, they played crap, and the crowd had to give an encore for 'Rock Lobster'.  What the fuck is that? 2.  Work is still kicking my ass, in the emotional way.  A coworker got transferred, and all of a sudden I'm a backstabber.  I've been called such before, but in this situation I did nothing.  I wash cars!  I have nothing to do with anything except doing what I am told, and the only thing I am ever told is to WASH FUCKING CARS! 3.  Got a great new haircut!  Okay now the rant.  I am not Shannon's type.  She says I'm wrong (actually she says she doesn't have a type, but, whatever...details) but I am right.  The proof lies in a few simple facts. 1.  Shannon was/is Punk.  I am not, or ever was punk.  I have been Geek as long as I can remember.  (actually Geek bordering on Loser, but, whatever...details) 2.  Everyone has their hollywood types that they crush on.  I have nothing in common with any of her hollywood crushes.  Johnny Depp?  Eddie Vedder?  Angelina Jolie?  HA!  I'm more of a John Godman looking mutha fucka, knaamean?  And I cetainitly don't have that cool, detached vacency in my eyes like those cats.  I am very attached. 3.  The clincher happened last night while watching the Beverly Hills 90210 Reunion special (and no we did not and will not watch "The O.C.").  You know how everyone either liked Brandon or Dylan, but nobody liked Steve?  While I dropped the question, Brandon or Dylan.  She said Dylan.  AH-HAH!  She has a type that I just don't fit into.  Granted its a type that harkens back to her early teenage years, but thems is some formative years, and some of those crushes ain't dead.  So I'm in a constant search for what exactly it was that drew her to me.  I am comfortable with the fact that we are soul mates, one of those sick couples that die within days of one another of a broken heart, but I still wish there was a more physical reason for her being drawn to me.  She claims the cute butt, but as a man I am incapable of understasnding the female love for man's butt.  Shannon, I don't care that I'm not your type, but the above questions and comments are all products of an overweight child's dementia.

       Damn, it's early...    I really should be sleeping in.  This is the first Sat I've had off in ages.  Jason's gone to work.  It's hard to sleep when he's not here.  Ooh, someone sounds codependent.  Anyway, this is my first blog entry.  Ever.  I don't really know what I should be saying...  I, too, wish we could afford the latest technology.  Unfortunately, we're college kids with no help from the 'rents.  It's hard sometimes, realizing we know no one in our situation.  At the same time, it's incredibly cool to be doing what we want (within financial limitations).  I mean, some people never find that someone they want to be with forever.  We're lucky.  School's kicking my ass.  I'm an English major, so i figured this semester would be a breeze.  All English classes.  Eek.  There's so much work involved.  Sometimes I think I want to sabotage myself so I'll have to stay in school longer.  School is all I know.  That and retail work.  But my paying job has always come second to finishing school.  Thing is, I've never been all rah-rah about school.  You could call me an observer.  I watch groups of people at school...and they usually annoy me.  I'm joing the Women's Issues Forum, though.  I hope to meet other women with similar ideas.  Those who don't believe the new feminism involves flashing your tits to get what you want!

       Today's Lesson: Credit Sucks    I really want a Tablet PC.  I imagine showing Shannon typed papers and watching her take the stylus to circle everything I did wrong.  I think I would be the kind of dork to use as a pad of paper and take notes in class.  I imagine keeping it running all night so when I wake up I can scribble down my dreams to upload to my blog. The creditors won't let me have it. I'm not the best with my money sure.  What they don't teach you is once you are 18, mistakes have acost affixed to them.  And if you can't figure it out in a month, the costs rises.  I NEED A TABLET PC.

It was about men and cheating.  What I don't understand is what drives the man to cheat?  The men on the show said it was ego, or rather the stroking of it.  Is there a burgening problem with middle-aged male self esteem in this country?  Would explain all the O'Reily heads out there...  - Me?  In class.

       Underworld    I know it's gotten crap reviews, bit I really dug this movie.  As an unfulfilled closet Goth, it spoke to the inner pissed preteen that always wanted to be a werewolf. Yeah, a werewolf.   I was rooting for the lycans in this movie because Vampires are dumb. Yeah, dumb. Euro-trash. Bourgeois.  Too pale.  Ego. I don't know what the reason but I can't dig on vamps.  Similarly, I can't figure out why I do dig on werewolves.  I'm not an exceptional dog-lover or outdoorsman, so it isn't some deep-rooted desire to pee on stuff. In fact, it was a werewolf movie (An American Werewolf in London) that turned me off horror flicks forever. It could have used some more hand to hand, but I imagine that that costs more money then people capping blanks at one another. I'm reading the book version so I'll drop how that turns out.

       A rant of political ideas &nbsp;   I'm turning this essay in tomorrow for my comparitice politics course.  The professor wanted to know our political beliefs.  Values, ideologies, beliefs, mores, and prejudices.  No political scientist should leave home without them.  They represent the opinions, experiences, and criticisms that people have learned, taught, and created for themselves.  Each word can carry a thousand different snapshots in time where a person understood something for a moment.  A moment where all the confusion, ignorance, and fear were swept away and all that remained were simply truths, or at the very least perceived truths.  For the purpose of organization, label these values, ideologies, beliefs, mores and prejudices into categories.  It is doubtful, however, that any one person can fit all of their snapshots into the categories.  That is why this paper isn’t titled “Tuesdays with Clinton” or “What Would Bill O’Reilly Do”.  I have too many pictures. Although, the left box is much fuller than the right box. My lean towards the left side of politics comes from being a middle class kid with working class parents.  They weren’t active in politics or even aware of politics, but the TV always stayed on the channel longer if a Kennedy was on the screen.  When I was younger, being a democrat, or on the left was much easier.  It was all about helping people.  These people are poor and need money, and if other people were saying we shouldn’t give it to them, they seemed cruel and mean.  The first thing taught in kindergarten is the ability to share.  As age and education start to grow, the ability to back-up those impulses to help people become harder.  Not everyone deserves help in everyone eyes.  That’s when the arguments start and you realize that you have much to learn.  Too much to learn. “What have you learned so far?” is what you’re asking me. I’ve learned that white people are still very afraid of black people.  I’ve learned that the separation of church and state will be a constant battle.  Ditto for abortion.  I’ve learned that feminism has many different meanings, from bra burning, to achieving untold success in a man’s world, and somehow, feminism can mean flashing breasts for beads at a festival.  I’ve learned that even the victims of genocide are willing to burn books. I don’t believe in being color-blind.  When a person is color blind, they can still see the world, just skewed a little.  Racism is still here.  The past forty years on non-legislated segregation is just a drop in the bucket compared to centuries of violence and intolerance.  White people seem to think that just because the drinking fountains are open to everyone that that somehow erases generations of pain and angst.  Black folk have taken their labels and used them to empower themselves, and now they just want a fair shot, and for some unimaginable reason that scares the hell out of white people.  White people claim to believe in an American Dream, or a melting pot.  Nevertheless, every time a minority gets a step forward, there is cadre of white people there trying to knock them back a few steps.  They use bibles against homosexuals.  They use the “not my ancestors” excuse.  They use acts of government to watch them attend their mosque.  They use “research” to make women feel guilty about becoming professionals and not staying at home to raise babies.  They use racial profiling.  They use words like abomination, will of god, and “for the children” to try to keep their piles of money and land safe. One of the smaller tragedies of 9/11 is that my generation is longer referred to as the first in U.S. history that may do worse financially than its parents.  We are now the 9/11 generation.  The “Shock and Awe” generation.  The War Against Terrorism generation.  Does my upcoming bachelor’s degree mean anymore than a diploma these days?  Does anyone realize that I have been socialized to go to college to get a “good job” instead of actually learning?  The distance between rich and poor may only be the length across a mile road, but it also plunges far much deeper.  My planet is dying, hormones in milk are making my daughter develop and become sexualized to early, the average life span for black makes is 25, Lieberman is trying to censor my videogames, my friends lost their financial aid because they got caught smoking pot, I’m overweight, TV tells me I’m not pretty enough, my grandmother can’t marry her girlfriend, you can’t smoke in New York, if I type the word “bomb” three federal agents get phone calls, there is an actual need for a gay high school, courts are deciding elections… and I am being told to watch out for suspicious looking brown men. I’ve learned that the face men aren’t important.  That guy kissing babies trying to get me to think of the good ‘ol days?  He means nothing.  It’s the guy behind the guy that you have to either worry about or believe in, and I guess that’s why I’m a political science major.  I don’t have grandiose visions of changing the world.  I think people that tell me that the hippies stopped Vietnam are still hitting the pipe to hard, but I do think that if I can believe that what I am doing is right, I can bring myself to terms with all of these problems I have with government and the state of our world.  I have difficulty calling myself left these days because of the way the right has been so successful at spinning liberal into a bad word.  Nevertheless, being a part of this lost generation does give a push to quantify and organize myself into the labels of my parents, my grandparents, and my grandparents’ parents.  I’m just not ready to yet.  I think like most Americans I am looking for a third answer.

       Big Update    Yeah, I have been off and on with the blogging lately, so I am going to drop some bullet points on some happenings.  - Did a huge rearrange on the apartment.  Made the master bedroom a 'fun' room with all the game systems, the PC, the comics, and soon enough all the other toys we got.  We've moved into the smaller bedroom in the hopes to soon develop a singular design style instead of a hodge podge of crap furniture.  Its so cozy in there, but we are worried about that room in the summertime.  It gets very, very warm.  - Totally loved I Love the 80's part Two thats been running all over Vh1 this week.  So much so, I'm tossing the link to the right.  - Got Matrix: Reloaded DVD, and I dig the movie more every time I see it.  - I am relatively sure that I did very well on my Stats midterm, accomplished alot for my group in my paper for my Presidents class, and have fallen horrendously behind in Comparative politics.  - Tetris Worlds for Xbox live is great, but I'm really looking forward to True Fantasy Live Online.  A MMORPG that looks great and looks like it plays great.  - Counseling is going well, and I'm making progress.  I just don't know how much longer I should go because that $12 a week is going to pile up.  - Setting Susan up with Rudy looks like it is going to be a good thing.  They have alot in common (she seems to have more in common with him than his last 8 dates) and geniunely like one another.  We shall see.  I thinks that is all for now.  I'll drop more posts once the wireless network at school gets going.

        You are Form 5,  Dragon : The Weaver.   "And The Dragon seperated the virtuous from the sinful.  He tore his eyes from his sockets and used them to peer into the souls of those on trial to make a judgement.  He knew that with endless knowledge came endless responsibility."   Some examples of the Dragon Form are Athena (Greek), St. Peter (Christian), and Surya (Indian). The Dragon is associated with the concept of intelligence, the number 5, and the element of wood. His sign is the crescent moon.  As a member of Form 5, you are an intelligent and wise individual.  You weigh options by looking at how logical they are and you know that while there may not always be a right or wrong choice, there is always a logical one.  People may say you are too indecisive, but it's only because you want to do what's right.  Dragons are the best friends to have because they're willing to learn.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       I really loved those pants...    I'm really sick and tired of hearing what all of these rich people get to do.  OU is in a well off area of metro Detroit, and much of the student body comes from that well-off background.  Hearing about Europe trips, and NY trips, and LA trips just makes me incredibly jealous.  I just can't help but feel that no matter how many times I play, my cards will never be any better than two pair, Queen high. I'm jealous of the clothes, the cars, the experiences, the ignorance, the attitude...they seem to just not care, or not know the privileges they earned by being born. And I've been trying not to judge... trying to stay open-minded.  But every time I meet someone intresting, someone that seems to have the same kind of mind, anecdotes about France or that friend with the boob-job or 'my mom/dad bought me this/that' pop out and it ruins it.  I get that wave of green that screams that I'll always be on the outside looking in.  So I ridicule them, and talk shit about them in my mind because maybe for a moment I can persuade myself I'm better because of the reasons I haven't had their experiences.  It's like I'm still the kid in imitation "Sikdz" (MC Hammer like pants) wearing them on the school bus, feeling proud of myself and feeling like today, yes, today is the day sixth grade Jason gets a nod or handshake or invite or girlfriend... only to have Mandy graves tell me how the pants went out like, two weeks ago. Well sorry Mandy, my birthday wasn't two weeks ago.  Can’t a brutha get an "A" for effort? The one thing I have to lord over them, a satisfyingly rich and powerful relationship with an amazingly talented and beautiful woman, doesn't count for anything because it seems lasting emotional and spiritual relationships built on friendship and trust and respect are not valued in their world of trying to one up each other with belt notches and "I left my panties as a memento" stories.

This is a book about all the people who work thier sack of in college, only to become confused, dissappointed, and jobless upon graduation.  The book compares the mid-twenties to adolescence or a the mid-life crisis as a way to legitmize her points.  But the problem without of her studies are the subjects.  Alot of these people have never had ANY job before, let alone some measure of experience to offer an employer.

I have learned so much from this book in the first few pages...it's inspiring and its a homecoming. To hear so many tales about people who just had to fight to get out of thier blue collar world, fight against parents, against the 'ol neighborhood, the against the self, and the fight against the white collar or the haves that are just oblivious to any of the working class struggles. Its not preachy, its not a Marxist manifesto in disguise, it is just a collection of stories and suggestions for people trying to break the class they were born into.  Its the struggle that faces myself, Shannon, my brother, and countless others.  We're all trying to get into the world that lies above the one we born into, and for me it has been especially hard. It's gratifing to hear the success stories of those in similar situations.  It reads all of the observations from my own class and others straight from my head and puts it on the paper.

       Work Ethic    Om God, the Lions!  They might actually win!  HA! Anyways, this is a look at my major homework. Tuesday: Comp Poli paper due Thursday: Polling paper due Wednesday : Winter registration  And I have no energy or drive to work on any of it.  Both papers are must do's and making a schedule has to wait until I can chat with a professor.  With my cold, and desire to just rest, however, I feel like nothing.  This problem has plagued me my entire life.   WOO-HOO Lions got an interception!  Whatever I uncover in counseling, it still doesn't beat out my inherent procrastination.  I DID do the flash cards trick for an exam last week, and couple that with some group studying, I think I did very, very well.  Did Harrington grow some facial hair?  Wasn't he babyfaced at the season start?  With the amount of classes I have to finish, it is still difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  But I have more focus than ever before, just displaced across my three classes.  Polling and Stats get the most attention, and the very important 100 level comparative politics class that I need to become a full fledged Poli Science major?  I hate it.  Its  8:00 am, and boring ass shit.  Its one of those classes were its all book learning, but the professor tries to make it more by throwing research papers.  Its silly as shit and a waste of my time.  But the era of dropping classes is over and I have to finish what I start.  Lions won.  Yea!

       urlLink Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition) : Daily News in English About Korea  This is a small article about Sunday night's presentation of Volcano High, possibly the most outlandiush thing I have ever heard of.  Its a korean movie about "crouching tiger" type high schoolers (see also Rival Schools) that basically kick ass. What  urlLink MTV  did was buy the rights, then redubb with rap stars.  RAP STARS!  This sounds hilarious and I am praying that there is the smallest chance that this is half way decent to watch.   urlLink Andre Ice Cold 3000  dubs the lead, with Snoop, Tracy Morgan, Mya and others in supporting roles. As a side note, doesn't it seem that there are alot of white geeks who love anime/manga, but hate rap and black folk?  Makes you wanna drop an episode of  urlLink DBZ  or  urlLink Akira  in the midddle of times square.

       urlLink Comment This! Blogger Comments System  I wanna throw a big shoutout to Nik Martin here.  I was informed today that my blog had more than a few comments on it, but I never knew because Enetation urlLink   wasn't updating the count.  So after five failed attempts to login to thier service, I decided to switch.  I came across  urlLink Comment! This  after a Google search, and in less than 5 seconds, had a new way to post comments.  This, in theroy, should work like a dream, and I've already tested it.  Nik offers this service for free, but hopes people will spread the word, or toss him two dollars.  Well, I'll probably do both, but if you're a  urlLink blogger  user, and can't figure out how to drop comments, give this a shot.

       urlLink Doc Octupus Doesn't Look as Cool as I'd thought  When Spider-Man cam out, I loved it.  Shannon and I saw it back to back.  But after my first DVD viewing, I hated it.  That long Parker hospital speech, the fact that Dunst made a boring and non-hot Mary Jane, and the "You mess with Spider-man you mess with New York" shit. Additional viewings (I was outta cable for a couple weeks) warmed me up to it again, thanks to the magicical fast-forward button.  After viewing the new trailer, highlighting one of the best parts of the first movie, I'm a little miffed.  Excuse the fanboyness inside me, but Doc Ock doesn't look cool at all.  I was expecting something kinda a scary, not this... he seemed megomanical sure, but not really inspiring awe.  He didn't seem powerful enough. I don't know.  I'm not a big fan of Spidey rouges anyway.

I need to read up on Milosivich. So now what?  C-Span coverage of war trials?  Can we bring him before the Security Council?  Oh...the books, the made for tv movies... the CNN news breaks.  Dammit, SNL is on Christmas break too. How do we handle this?  Did I hear them call this Operation Red Dawn?   urlLink Red Dawn , the movie where the Russians take over a small town in America?

Awesome beat, awesome lyrics, and probably the most awesome thing about the song, its personal. I automatically respect any rapper or hip-hop artist who does something other than the usual club hit.  AUTOMATICALLY.  Read his bio then read up on his accident.  Its a good story.

       urlLink Amazon.com: Electronics: Sony CLIE PEG-NR70V Handheld  The link above is to a Palm I'm selling on Amazon.  Buyer gets the palm unit, and the stylus.  No other accesories, sorry!  Buy it please!  I need the flow soooo badly...  In other news, two weeks after spending a Saturday afternoon cleaning the apartment, and making all sorts of well wishes to never allow it to get to the horrendous condition it was in...the apartment is trashed.  Between all the books Shannon is selling, our school stuff, the open DVD's (no cable + VCR in game room = Non-stop cable viewing), empty cigarette boxes I never throw away, etc, etc, and etc...Forgive the expression, but it looks like a bomb went off. What makes it weird is that Shannon and I both grew up in very clean houses.  So it leads me to believe its a Libra thing.   We are both naturally messy people.  I generally get fed up with it before Shannon, going from room to room with a garbage bag, swearing I'll never do it again...  Lotsa new neighbors in our building, the one next to us blares his television while watching sports and action flicks.  I believe he is another newly divorced man in his first home after losing his own, and is acting out, revealing in his new freedom.  I can't imagine being divorced.  Losing the home, the children, the money, the neighbors, the friends that took sides, the books, the CD's, the movies...  I just can't imagine getting to that point with someone.  Learning to hate them, or at the very least, hating how they make you feel, seems like such a foreign concept to me.  Like living on the west-side of Detroit... It'd be a whole new world.  I'd move to Alaska before the west-side.  Now extend that metaphor to divorce.  Shannon's ex has been calling...I'm still discerning what my feelings are, and how to handle the situation.  Why are my feelings involved with her ex?  Long story, they just are.  One work visit with no communication, one phone call at work that sounded like it played like the  urlLink apology step for alcoholics .  There was the mention of a 'get together' though, and that's what bothers me.  Don't presume that you get to have her back.  I'm more than you.  Always will be.  This will be the second time you've dropped into the past looking for companionship or understanding, and that first trip lead Shannon to me didn't?  If its about you, let me save you the trouble: move on.  Obviously these trips fail for you, and you'd be better off finding someone new, or just being on you're own.  If its about me, well you just bring that business to me.  There is no reason to involve Shannon if you need to confront me.  Do the right thing, or just leave your ego behind.  Either way, I'll keep her.

       Internet people    I like reading blogs and message boards.  I read the  urlLink Kevin Smith  boards,  urlLink EGM boards ,  urlLink Peter David's blog , and  urlLink Christopher Priest's  blog.  Here is the thing, clebs or quasi-celebs, David and Priest, use their websites as a way to communicate with their audience, as well as promote their projects.  Fans can comment and leave posts and all of that good stuff, but I'm really perturbed by the nay-sayers.  The people who take the time to tear these people apart.  They are exceptionally harsh, and often have misconceptions of the work they are commenting on.  They clog up the pages with trash and bile, and force the owner of the site into a defensive position, and that is what bothers me.  Why place yourself in the position?  Is it sheer self-confidence?  Is it blind strength in their work and characters? I can't imagine having to explain myself to any tool with the inclination and connection speed to thrash my life's work.    The second annoyance is the "net-quasi-celebrity".  Hosts of rumor mills or news sites that gain some bizarre notoriety because of their 'tude or gossip ability.   urlLink Harry Knowles  and that.  WTF is that about?  Its cultish.  Are we all so obsessed with celebrity?  Are we all so shallow?

      Decided not to go for a "political" job.  It was a door to door thing for Clean Water Action.  Four reasons why not: 1.  2:30 -10 pm, monday thru friday means Shannon or me would be on the bus all the time 2.  Personel invasion is not my thing.  Plus im a big dude, and if I'm knocking at your door, chances are, you wont answer it. 3.  Would have to completely rework school schedule, and its too diffcult to find classes in first place. 4.  Lack the passion.  My professor thought waiting for something was a  good idea, but he insisted that I need work experience before I graduate.  I guess washing cars dont count.

       urlLink Camera Phone Moblog Community - textamerica.com | 2004 I love textamerica.com and the concept of a moblog.  I am however very disappointed that its been taken over by dudes who just want to see "amatuer" chicks.  There are feet pics and belly pics and all the most visited sites are of girls, and even sicker, girls that work for Techtv.  TechTv girls are cool and everything, but I don't think they are into being sex objects.  Anyway, the morale of the story is that we as men, after every technical achievement, every new idea, every step we make forward into becoming closer to the gods and goddesses, we, the men of the world, the architects of this unstoppable juggernant called the patriarchy...we as men use it for cleavage photos.

       urlLink MIKE_ROWE_SOFT  For those of you not in the know, Microsoft was suing a high school student for having a url to close to microsoft's  urlLink Microsoft.com.   His site  urlLink mikerowesoft.com  has gotten a huge amount of tech media attention, as the "evil claws" of Gates and Co. grew tighter and tighter around him.  The kid, sporting a huge pair of balls, fought back, didn't settle.  Microsoft, probably facing huge media scrutiny, folded and settled with Mike Rowe.  Mike must change his website name, and Microsoft has hooked Mike up with an Xbox, oppurtunity to become MS certified, and to take care of any cost incurred from changing his web address. My point in this rundown?  I'm making an effort to better flesh out my blog entries.  I'm not looking to becomea source of news or anything like that.  No, NO!  I will still be bitching about any random bits that cross across my lap.  But I will be trying to give a little more background into WHY I'm bitching about it.   I'm not bitching about this MS story though.  I think its great that Bill is helping out this kid.  As opposed to suing him out of house and home, unlike other coprate superpowers like the RIAA.  Which just sucks.

       Now I remember!    Shannon has been having alot of run-ins with her most hated enemy lately: The Past.  First it was the ex's mom.  Then it was the ex.  Then it was my ex's mom.  Then it was a different ex and her boyfriend, and finally a shared mutual ex-friend of us both.  Shannon is horrible at these meetings, all of which have happened at work.  They are always very quick, how's the weather interchanges, that always result in awkward good-byes after only a few moments.  What bugs me the most about these meetings is one simple fact: THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT ME!  No one asks how I am, and Shannon doesn't tell them.  Like our relationship is some secret that everyone knows but everyone pretends to not know.  EVERYONE KNOWS WE ARE TOGETHER!!!  Fuck, you'd think my ex would blurt out a, "Hey hows that guy I once dated umpteen years ago?"  And why doesn't Shannon just blurt it out.  "I'm good, I'm good.  Jason is great too."  Am I really that awkward of a conversation topic?  Does the mention of my name bring about regret or guilt in other people's mind's?  In Shannon's mind? The worst part is, I never bump into anyone.  Granted Shannon's job places her a little bit more accesible than mine, but just once I'd like to bump into somebody from the past, which isn't a dirty word for me, and shit, just catch up.  I think the potential for embarrassment of self validation is too high to just exchange pleasantries.

       Ohhh look at the blinking lights!     urlLink Paying Attention to Adult ADD  So there has been a development in the saga.  I may have Adult ADD.  Next week, I will be subject to a small battery of tests that will determine if I have this disorder. Mosley Braun is on Daily show RIGHT NOW! I have two major concerns about this possible diagnosis. 1.  If I have it, I run the risk of spending a lifetime on medication.  While ultimately proving invaluable, I never imagined myself the 'crutch' type.  While I am certainly unconvinced by holistic medicine, I do believe in mind over matter. 2.  I don't have it.  And the search for the reason for why I have such difficulty in studying and performing at my potential in school and eventually my career will have once again escaped me.  My "magic pill" escape hatch will have malfunctioned, and I'll be left with the problem that maybe, just maybe, I'm not as smart as I think I am.  "I'm not as smart as I think I am."

       Real World SUCKS ASS    Lemme tell you how unexcited I am baout the upcoming season of the Real World: San Diego.  This once fantastic experiment in culture clash has now turned into some bizarre sofrtcore porn show where individuals with the lowest possible IQ, but a nice set of tits or pecs, are allowed to become quasi-celebrities as we watch them suffer through hang-over after hang-over.  Look, I'm not some goddamn purist wish for the days someone like Norman or Kevin or Pedro or Julie or whoever else that was on the show when it is good.  Is sex intresting?  Yes.  Is watching metrosexuals scream at each other in bar engaging?  Probably.  Girls making out, is that cool?  Mos def.  But all of these things that used to happen at random on the show, now seem expressly engineered. Whats really funny about this farce is how people just a few years younger than me LOVE it.  There are so many distinctions amongst all of us post-post baby boomers.   Thats a rant for another time. The point is, FUCK  YOU Real World San Diego.  FUCK YOU!

With a  urlLink marriage amendment  on the table,  urlLink Clear Channel controlling the media , and the  urlLink consistent conservative transformation   of the country, the idea of paying higher taxes and gaining a sillier accent aren't as discouraging anymore. 3.  Finishing the degree, then finding what I want to do for a career.  Why not the field of study I've spent bajaillions on?  A group's inability to work and act like a group in a class project has left quite a bitter taste in my mouth.  I've learned that teamwork, either used in academia or in the workplace, actually refers to one person assuming a leadership position, and then attempting to complete the project themselves, too paranoid and too lacking in  actual  leadership skills to bring the best performance out of their team.  Or maybe she's just a bitch. 4.   urlLink Still mad at Nader.  Go Jen!!!  5.  New Orleans was great!   Currently in my head:  urlLink Going to bed

       Knaamean?    Laptop has been sent out for overheating and multi monitor problems.  I got a digital camera (mostly).  Its pretty cool, eats batteries alive though.  Seriously, we are talking like a few hours and its time for new batteries.  If the Best Buy douche would've mentioned that when trying to pawn off the docking cradle, might've gotten that.  Had phase two of ADD testing.  I don't think I am ADD anymore though.  A test that was supposed to take 4+ hours took 2.  And I did really well on this attention test.  There is a box with a small digital number readout, and it has a giant blue button.  There are three phases: the first is pres the blue button get a point.  If you press it again too quickly, you get no points.  2nd phase, numbers flash on the readout, you can only press the button when a 9 follows a 1.  The final phase had numbers flashing everywhere, and you had to do the 9 and 1 thing again.  Aside from annoying the fucking shit out of me, I didn't feel like I lost attention of anything.  So yeah...    No updates or new moblog for Mardi Gras.  I'm not spending my entire vacation fumbling with computer stuff.  Plus, like I stated above, laptop is out for service.

       F***     urlLink CNN.com - Democratic battle turns into two-man race - Feb. 18, 2004  So it ends with Dean pledging to change and renew and change the democratic party by furthering the grass roots campaign started in his honor.  I think thats an amazing idea.  If anyone knows if this is just politicain shloop, let me know, because the reason I followed Dean and gave him my primary vote is because of his desire to change the party.  I'm a young 'liberal' too mid-west for the greens and too blue color for the Republicans, but when I look at the democratic party, I see a group too confused or too broken to actually perpetuate any agenda, let alone thier own.  I was looking for an inspiration and I got Dean.  Well all of the other democrats must have disagreed with me because look at who's left.  Kerry who reminds me of Gore sooo much, and Edwards who...  he uhm...  jesus I don't have the foggiest idea about this mutha-fucka.  Both are probably more willing to tread the middle realm for swing votes, and to get closer to the main goal: Beat Bush. Well, I gotta disagree.  America is playing campaign manager with Kerry and Edwards, and all it can do is hurt them.  Six months from now when Kerry is dropping some centrist thinking education plan, and glad-handing No Child Left Behind with Bush at the debates, all us liberals are going to be looking at the Nascar Dad numbers, wondering why this unimpassioned robot, party-dog was ever allowed in New Hampshire let alone the big game.  I least Dean would've flamed out.  Would have crossed lines, broke new campaign ground, changed the FUCKING GAME, instead we get Dukakis and Bush Sr.  -sigh-   Currently in my head:  urlLink Angel @ 9pm

       The Buffy-verse is officially over.     urlLink E! News  is reporting that the Angel series will end at the end of this season.  If you know me, you know I've been gushing about this show all season.  It has been excellent this season, and has made my Wednesday nights very happy.  David and the cast has turned their shows conventions upside down, and have brought guffaws outta me that most sitcoms fail to do.  Its a shame the show is getting the axe, but after five years, three of which were on the chopping block, the show is ending at the top of its game.  A stroke of luck that Buffy wasn't even able to achieve. So what now Whedon?  Aside from the comic books, what do you have for me?  Will there be anymore Buffy or Angel?  Actually it doesn't even matter if its B and A, lets just get some interesting and fun writing back on TV.

I'm not sure if I dropped this on the blog before, but I'm going to Mardi Gras.  I'm going to FUCKING MARDI GRAS!  A few months ago, a few of us went to the bar.  A place called  urlLink Gator Jake's .  After quite a few beers, the waitress dropped off a few entry forms for the trip, sponsered by  urlLink Bud Light .  I crumpled mine up as the everyone else started filling thiers out.  Shannon told me I was a douche, and relunctantly filled out the form.  A few weeks later, about a week before Christmas, I got home to find a  urlLink FedEx  package on my door.  And inside was a letter to prove my eligibilty to particpate in the contest, because I had won it. Today we got our plane tickets.  Today we got our hotel details.  Today we screamed, jumping up and down, relizing that for the first time ever, we are going away for Spring Break instead of working.  And we are going to fucking  urlLink Mardi Gras . I'm gonna bring the laptop and possible a digital camera to upload pictures to a new Moblog using by  urlLink textamerica.com .  We are only there a few days, so I'll there will be lots of pictures.  Plus I'll have the regular camera as well.  The trip will be well documented for the few who care. More importantly, we are going to have a ball.

       Week in Review    Its been a strange week in popular media hasn't it?  A great sports game overshadowed by a women's breast.  Bush telling the country, "Yeah sorry about that, but hey, I did do this other thing."  Dean systematically losing any chance of getting the nomination.  Massachutes opening a road for gay marriage.  Angel's 100th episode featuring the demise of Cordelia Chase. Personally, I had a a big week as well.  I got word that testing begins full swing next Tuesday.  I swore off Chrisitianity forever (at least for now, y'know socialization).  I was finally able to back-up the laptop to send to Emachine repair.  Yeah, big week.  God, I need to party.

      I have to see a play tonight for my theatre class.  I'm all about culture, but this is a class where the professor has shown up roughly 60% of the time, and reads out of the book.  He is requiring a level of dedication to the source material and theme of the class, while he himself provides no self discipline to accept his own responsibilities, not only as a teacher, but as a supposed teacher of theatre arts.  Therefore, he is my douche of the week.     Currently in my ears:  urlLink Whatever pops up on shuffle on the ipod.

       I'm watching all the Sunday morning shows, and the same issues are popping up.  The war, US/Europe relations, terrorism, occupation, No Child..., conservatism vs. liberalism, and of course, who will lead this country come November.  My question is, let's say Kerry wins.  And let's say he knocks out all the major issues in the first two years.  Reform of No Child, Medicare, the troops, Osama, all of his big points are taken care of in those first two years.  What next?  As a pretty liberal cat, I have to wonder how effective and how true to his base Kerry will be.  This election is going to be tight.  Tighter than last election probably.  And when the issues of this campaign are over, and the problems of right now have faded from the NY Times limelight, what would Kerry do?   Will he bring, whether effectively or not, a liberal agenda into the West Wing.  Environment?  Universal Health Care?  Privacy?  Civil Rights?   Look what's happening now IS important, and I'm sure over the next 32 weeks we will here about all of these issues.  And outside of ad analysis, and stump speeches, I want to hear something new.  That's why I was down with the Dean camp.  I was hearing a proud liberal say something new, on a stage usually reserved for moderation and safe speech.  Dean lost the primaries because the most extreme of democrats didn't think he could win the crossover.  He was too liberal, too free thinking, too intent on spinning this country in a completely different way of thinking.  I think that's what this country needs.  Kerry's plan to roll back the past three years isn't solid enough for me.  Take what we have, take how far we have gotten, and change the course.  Change the results mid-project.  For as much as going to Iraq was ill-planned and ill-conceived, Saddam was a fucking douche.  Installing a democratic 'regime' in Iraq, while a violation of everything I believe in the sovereignty of nations, will eventually be good for America, not just Haliburton.   So lets take what is given, and move on.  Find new realms and ideas to explore.  Voting for Bush means more of the same (which I don't like) and a vote for Kerry means spending four years repealing everything that Bush spent his four years creating.   Time to move to England.

      To those who know me, I have what only can be characterized as a heterosexual crush on Ben Affleck.  I can't really explain the affection for him, but it is something I had to live with since the release of  urlLink Good Will Hunting , and it is an affection that has only endured and grown over time.  God, I really can't believe I'm blogging this... So  urlLink Kevin Smith  has decided to go serious, to move away from the dick and fart jokes part of his life, and to move into becoming something more mature.  I applaud the move.  I love watching the change and maturation of directors, actors, bands, etc. as they move through their lives and as I move through my own.  So my favorite director, and my favorite actor are teaming up again for  urlLink Jersey Girl , and I get to reap the benefits as the pound the media to get America to see this movie. I got Kevin and Ben on  urlLink Dateline  last Friday, and Ben on  urlLink SNL  yesterday.  Tomorrow I got Ben on Leno, he usually shows up Kilborn too, and there is a rumor he'll be on  urlLink Howard Stern  this week as well.  urlLink March 26th, you know where I'll be.

      Finally, MTV gets it right.  For years MTV has tried to tap into the "Do it Yourself" kick pioneered by Trading Spaces and the like.  They have finally achieved it with "Pimp My Ride".  First off, these aren't any rich white kids getting Mom and Dad's Delta 88 fixed up.  These are REAL people who saved up and bought what they could: rusted-out, falling apart, and embarassing to drive.  And the custom shop really hooks them up.  In the first episode, the girl got a CD/DVD/MP3 player to replace her 8-trak, 2 LCD screens, a motorized shoe orgainizer, accent lights, great rims, a paint job, and a working river thing in the backseat.  The car looked fantastic and the girl's reaction was great.  She truly appreciated it.  All hosted by Xzibit. Wow, MTV.  You actually did something right.

      This is what I did today: Cleaned the apartment a little, watched TV, downloaded music (iTunes), watched TV, and played with the blog.  I did these things all day. Thus the beauty of Sunday.  THere is nothing going on.  No big responsibilities or homework.  Just me, the TV, the laptop, and the occasional ass scratch and ball tug, and bomb, an entire day wasted.  Finishing school this term has felt great.  It was a moderate to high stress term, depending on the week, and depending on the weather.  A no brain power used, no aching bones, or car wash drenched pants day that left no permanent effect other than the butt print in my couch. It was good, but I don't want any more.

      No, I haven't seen the whole thing, but I'm really kind of weirded out to see the President holding a prime time press conference about Iraq.  I'm just a political science undergrad, but I am pretty sure that this is a campaign move.  I mean, primetime, repeated catch phrases.  A singular message topped with sweets about America's strength, the opportunity of freedom, and God's will, it sounds like a rallying of the troops and a move to make Iraq the central theme of the campaign.  The 'ol "What?  This economy?" trick.  Tomorrow's airwaves are going to be rife with debate.  One side slamming the other, its going to be dirty, and I don't know if I have the stomach for it. In Monday's campaigns class, we debated ethics.  It comes down to two ideas: Civic responsibility vs. Self interest.  Civic Responsibility: a campaign manger works with a responsibility for the public good, and for democracy.  A society with civic responsibility will eventually lead to a perfect society.   Self-interest: a responsibility to the individual.  A society where people serve their own self-interest will eventually lead to a perfect society. I think my political life will fall in the realm of Civic responsibility.   The idea of ends justifying the means troubles me.  Mix that with an overall disenfranchisement in my supposed chosen field and you get the usual mess of... well confusion.

      R.I.P.  Kurt Cobain. Here's my rant on Kurt's death.  He overdosed in Europe on heroin, which was the proverbial cry for help.  He was sent back the states, and was all alone.  His wife should have been there, or a band member, or someone who considered him a friend.  It's called a suicide watch people, and those close to him screwed the pooch on that one. Here's my rant on his life.  Five years ago, hell, two years ago, I would have gone on and on about how overrated Kurt was.  I would have bitched about his status as rock deity was the by-product of overzealous critics and Gen-xers, including myself, and his impact was too early lost in a wash of pop-punk, cookie cutter rap music, and teenie pop.  And I am right. But I am also wrong.  Last year, they released "You Know Your Right".  A never before released Nirvana tune that was a hundred times better than 95% of the music out there.  A song, nearly ten years old, ripped through radio and almost performed the same trick "Smells Like Teen Spirit" did when it killed pop rock and hair bands.  Music execs must have been relieved when Nirvana died.  They could restart the same techniques that lined their pockets for years, without the nucisance of people trying to break the mold.  No more ticketmaster lawsuits.  No more money spent on musicians who may not sell stratosphere numbers.  Yes, there are exceptions today, but there are few and far between in corporate controlled radio playlists, and the cloneing of hip-artists, emo bands, and teen friendly marketing gimmicks.   Why is Kurt important?  Awesome songs, awesome spirit.  "Let me die before I become Pete Townsend."  that's some rock star shit!  His impact IS large, but mostly because it was a time in music where it felt, even the slightest bit, that it was in the listeners hands.  A time where everything seemed so important, and music seemed to have the answers to everything.

      Another Saturday passes, and once again its late, I watched SNL, and I'll be going to bed soon.  I've played some video games.  I surfed the web.  I did a little (very little) homework.  I dropped a blog entry.  I am the world's most bored boy.  I'm the only person I know who doesn't work on Sunday, and all of my friends (about 2-3) are asleep, getting rested for tomorrow.  I could stay up late and channel flip, but it's be quicker to cut off a finger, and probably more enjoyable.  The neighbor's are partying, I'm on the couch with a blanket on my lap bitching about boredom.  I am an exciting guy, I just don't have the funds or proper social climate to express it.  If anyone has info on how to get a life, holla.   Currently in my ears:  urlLink The Hunger by The Distillers    Currently in my head:  urlLink Nothing     p.s.

      I'm bothered  latest  urlLink GoArmy.com  commercials.  It highlights a bunch of brown men in turbans wearing turbans and guns.  I suppose it is slightly realistic considering the situation we are in, but at the same time, it's a pretty bold image.  Especially with the added crosshairs tossed upon their faces.

      Behold!  The tale of my Thursday night suck-ness.  I had been battling a horrible headache all day.  It might be a sinus headache (I've been battling it today too) and it's right in the front of my head.  After taking three tylenol at work in the morning that didn't work, I came home yesterday weary, and in dire need of my favorite pain reliever, Advil.  I took three.  Something I don't do often, but my head really hurt.  It was a mistake.  About a half hour later, I get dizzy.  Can't walk dizzy.  After that, the sweats hit.  Even when I am active, I don't sweat as much as I was, sitting in my chair.  So, I'm freaking out, and I go to lay down.  I used the walls to help along the way, and laid there for ten minutes, before deciding that I was probably going to puke at any moment, and I headed to the bathroom.  I sat on that toilet for another half hour, decided if I was going to puke, I would do so comfortably in me bed.  Shannon wiped my down with a cold rag, which helped with the sweating, and I fell asleep.  I didn't wake up again until 7 o'clock in the morning.  It doesn't sound like much, but in my head, I was very freaked out.  It felt like hell, and as a man who prides himself on his health, it was very, very scary.

      It's three in the morning, have to be at work at eight, and for the second night in a row and for the fourth time in the past two weeks, I cannot sleep.  My mind and body seem too restless as I lay down.  I can't seem to relax either one, leaving me to believe that I need to find some daytime activity to release the energy within, and video games and books don't seem to be doing the trick.

      I've had a sort of, maybe, not quite breakthrough.  I live a very unhealthy life.  Bad food, way too many cigarettes, bad sleep, and a complete lack of physical activity.  I have ideas to remedy this, and have been sort of, maybe, not quite working on bettering myself for a while now, but the time has really come to put some REAL effort in.  So I finally have to take Ryan on his offer to help me learn how to get fit, I must start saving for a new mattress to sleep on, CUT WAY DOWN and quit the cigarettes, and stay away from that crappy fast food I had given up for at least a year before I started this job at  urlLink ERAC .  In other news, I'm still on the look out for a new tattoo, and so far the only thing in my mind is this: urlLink  a Zelda inspired Triforce with Latin, Arabic, or maybe a language of my own creation stating Power, Wisdom, and Courage on each triangle .  Shannon thinks this is a bad idea for a tattoo.  Thoughts?

      So like I was sixteen again, I'm sitting in front of the TV, watching Mtv (Mtv2 actually).  I somehow got thinking about my future before, spelling complete doom for the REM cycle.  I'm worried and plain scared.  So I want to start doing creative important things now.  I'm not going to be any smarter or motivated when I complete school next year, so why not trying to be supercool successful and intresting now, right?  Yes, tomorrow will be the day! Except I don't know what to try and do.

      Marriage, I assume, can be a very stressful time.  I find it hard to imagine it is simple to look at someone everyday and carry-on with normal business when in a matter of days, you'll be exchanging vows and signatures promising a life-long commitment to one another.  "Sweetie, can you pass the ketchup and tell me this 'to death do us...' stuff is going to work?"  "On your way home can you pick up some toilet paper and promise me you'll always be true to me and never love another?"  "Oohhh baby, that's the spot, oh and by the way, you must always love and, uhhh, cherish me!" So when people start talking, and judging, and giving advice I'm sure emotions, patience, and strength begin to wane.  So this is a message to the happy couple to be.  Stop listening to us.  All of us.  The parents, the friends, the co-workers, the passer-bys...We have no idea what we are talking about because we are neither of you, and as you enter into this realm of life, and love, the two of you are the only one's you should be listening to.  If someone does happen to drop there two cents, well we all know that pennies are basically worthless anyway.  The only thing that matters from here on out is the union.  I can't imagine that anyone is mad, upset, or disappointed in either of you right now.  And no one will be mad, upset, or disappointed in you come the Big Day.  Just listen to each other, and when the other one isn't talking, start talking yourself.  When we talk, especially me, you really don't have to listen.  And when we say something to one of you, we really know that information will be passed to the other, because, hey, the two of you are now closer to one another than the rest of us.  You know one another's faults, dreams, hopes, and failures.  And your opinions are the only things that truly matters.  Stop listening to all of us.  Just listen to yourselves and each other.  I'm not mad at anyone, except the Bush administration.  I'm certainly no mad at either of you.  Especially you.

Frodo gives this look that seems he is asking Aragorn, "How dare you ask me to continue?", while at the same time, grieving over the loss over a friend.

       urlLink     I went to Border's tonight, and grabbed the usual handful of graphic novels, web programming books, and Toyfare.  AND because I am a political science major, I thought I'd check out on of the thousand political books that are dropping right now.  I grabbed "House of Bush, House of Saud" by Craig Unger.  I picked a random section and just started reading. I came very close to getting upset and crying in the little cafe at Border's.  What this administration has done to confuse the realms of private and public... lining their own oil soaked pockets with the gold of the middle east and the blood of America's soliders.  Then I got angry about all of the Bush supporting pundits that always try to demonize Democrats when they speak about the war.  Or ask questions of the administration.  Or try to find out the who, what, when, where, why, and how of Iraqi detainees.  The endless spinning of an obvious pockmark in American politics, and the people who NEED to read these books aren't.  It's wasted on me because I already have my vote planned and ready to go; I just need the booth.  I'm sorry, but we Americans are very stupid, and kept in the black of so much.  Left to fend for ourselves in the midst of a race and class war, the middle and lower classes are overworked and underpaid and under-educated, and when left in the hands of a profit based, sensational press, are too busy and too stupid to care about the bigger issues at hand. We are obsessed with celebrity and the ever evasive "rich" someday quest.  Foreign policy?  All we understand is dollars and deaths.  Domestic policy?  Just keep school free and the minorities away from the jobs and our women. So many don't vote, and those who do are the victims of pinpoint accurate electioneering and voter targeting.  The state of this country is so incredibly sad... I don't know how to change it. I don't know how to fix it.  I don't know how to beat against the wall without breaking my hands.  I don't know how to beat the wall without losing my mind.

      Angel ends with little to none resolution, leaving fans to beg, plead, and grovel to the feet of Joss Whedon for a Buffy/Angel big screen film.  When the producer credits hit the screen, I tossed a chip clip into the fan in pure anger.  The show ended really well, almost Buffy Season 5 well, and it's just really disappointing that there will be no more.  Angel always had a creative edge over Buffy, and hit its stride in the third season.  This season was arguably the best in both series, as the show reinvented itself again and never ceased to entertain.  I'm very, very sorry to see it go, and I eagerly await a future Angel or Buffy project.  You've hooked me for life, Joss, you have to throw me a fix once in a while.  urlLink

I got into in Season 2, and have learned to hate in season 3.  The last ten minutes of the season finale completely made the weeks of torture worth it.  SPOILERS!     1. Lionel shaves head. 2. Chloe and her father?  Dead. 3. Supergirl?  Never exisited. 4. Lana? Pete? Kissed Smallville good-bye. 5. Lex?  Poisoned. 6. Pa Kent?  Dead? 7. Clark's in the fucking Phantom Zone!  THE PHANTOM ZONE!  And now... the end of Angel.  sniff...

       I don't hate homosexuals. I don't regard them as my enemy. They are the mission field that believers/followers of Christ are to go out and harvest. They are, like we have been in the past, vile sinners who need to be savingly joined to Christ. So its not out of hate that I'm in opposition to homosexuality, its out of a loving concern to see them changed by the power of the Gospel.   I picked up this quote from a discussion on  urlLink Priest's  website.  Now we should all be up to date about my views on homosexuality and same sex marriage (I'm bout-it bout-it).  What strikes me about this quote is the reference to "harvest".  Isn't that the strangest way to refer to people; likening homosexuals to a crop to be cut and processed and consumed?  It's as insulting to me as the whole 'sheepeople' idea.  He uses the word need.    It just throws me off guard when I cross something like this.  It just seems like backward thinking and it frightens me to think that faith, belief, and morality along these lines are commonly referred to as enlightenment.

      More therapy tomorrow.  I've been in it for months and months and it has been rewarding in many ways.  Still don't know the results of my ADD testing, but I am assured the report is coming soon.   Since school has ended in April, I have been spending zero time thinking about my future.  ZILCH!  This is very characteristics unlike me.  I have a reputation for being dreadfully introspective and constantly self-absorbed about my life and future.  Lately, however, I have been bereft of ideas and thoughts about my life and long term goals. I WILL graduate  urlLink OU  with a Political Science degree, but beyond that I don't have any ideas.  I really don't have the passion for politics.  You should see the motivation of some of these fuckers.  It reads like a resume for a  urlLink superhero  with all of the accomplishments and ideas these people kick around.  Even outside of my own self doubt, these people are perpetual go-getters, and I can't imagine having a life where I am constantly impressed of the skills of others. So the search goes on.  I got a real kick out of going to the  urlLink Motor City Comic Con  last weekend, but damn if every indie publisher is looking for artists or all around creators, not plain old writers.  I think about self-publishing, and when school rolls around again, maybe I'll put up some flyers looking for an artist to collaborate with.   At the end of the day though, I can't seem to reconcile the dreams with the practical.  How can I keep the belly full, working electricity, support Shannon's  urlLink Oxycotin  habit, AND pursue life goals and dreams, that may not ever give a big payoff.  Okay, yeah, there is the benefit of loving your work and blah, blah, blah... but in my own head, I can't seem to find a balance.  Or my life's work.

      I'm going to go to the doctor for my sickness.  Hopefully it's no big whoop, but I must figure out what is wrong with my stomach.  The pains are coming less frequently but they are still pretty strong.  My problem is I have no insurance, so there is an extra little desire that whatever it is that's wrong with me, is no big deal.  This will be the first snag I've run into since I lost my health insurance, and when I think about the cost and potential health issues at stake, I get pretty worried, and frankly scared.

      Just caught Britany Spears' new video.  It's crappy.  Look, I've got plenty of sympathy for the trappings of celebrity.  The pictures, the tabloids, the lies, and half-truths that surround thier lives as soon as we fall in love with them is sharp double-edged sword for being successful.  But there is something about Ms. Spears bratiness and schizophrenic slut/virign persona that just bugs me to the point where I feel she deserves the incredible public scrutiny that she gets.  Madonna never apologized or complained as much as Ms. Spears has about her sexuality of public screw-ups.  Ms. Spears want us to worship and fantasize about her, while at the same time, allow her to be a child and make mistakes and be absolved of them.   She's not that hot either.

      So... for whatever reason, Shannon and I are watching a particularly weird move called "Gothic".  Now, I would certainly consider myself an evolved and educated man, but this film and its mansion hoping madmen and madwomen have, and perhaps rightly, perplexed me.  I'm no stranger to abstract imagining, horror, or synthesized music, but I have to wonder what exactly the filmmakers were on and into when detailing the syphilis, alcohol, and plain old kookiness fueled dramatization of the night that gave birth to Mary Shelly's Frankenstien.   Goats, horses, Henry Fuseli, suicide, orgies, and you can't forget the greatest nightmare of all, christianity, all form to create senseless drivel that only film students and schizophrenics can understand or enjoy.  But hey, I've never been medicined by leeches, so I guess I can't judge.   Currently in my Picture Box:  urlLink Gothic    Currently in my Browser:  urlLink The Life of Henry Fuseli

       urlLink    So the class I've been dying for all Spring/Summer has been cancelled.  CSE 251, otherwise known as Introduction to Web Design, is no more, and with it go the chances I'll be able to graduate this year.  The class was going to be the next step in completing my Computing Minor, which was going to fill the void in my credits after I completed my Major in Political Science credits.  So, I'm taking it on both ends now because I cannot register for fall, because I owe money.  I owe money because I'm in counseling to find why I can't do better in school.  Financial Aid didn't cover my entire balance because it transferred book money to my Spirit Card to cover the costs of books for the class that has no been cancelled.  I cannot get a new class for the summer (remaining balance) and I can't prepare for the fall because registration is over.  Most importantly, I cannot take this anymore.  Through my entire college career, I have been fortunate to not run into these problems before.  I've rarely had a hiccup with the financial aspect or anything else.  Now, as I plan to finish school once and for all... shit is flying in to one big fucking fan.

      I finally watched my first episode of CSI: Miami earlier this evening, and then later watched an episode of CSI: Las Vegas.  Miami is anywhere close to having the fun, humor, drama, and plain 'ol watchability of Vegas.  The characters are far more interesting and in-depth, and frankly, so are the situations.  The Miami cast just doesn't seem to be enjoying themselves like Vegas, especially Caruso, who's stotic and deadpan delivery for each and ever line, regardless of the scene's individual dramatic climax, had me switching to the equally substandard 51 Funniest Smart-Asses on Comedy Central.

      Now is your oppurtunity to mess with my life!  I have NO desire to learn a foreign language (web code not included) and couldn't care less which language class I barely pass this fall.  So help me out, and tell me which one I should take.            Which Language Should I Register for the Fall Semester?         Lingusitcs (the science of language)   German   French   Japanese   Spanish           &nbsp;&nbsp;           urlLink  Free polls from Pollhost.com

      So I have yet been able to register for classes for the fall.  That is bad.  This being the "last" year of my collegiate career, it is very important for me to get the classes I need to graduate.  So after getting letter after letter in the mail showing different account balances, I made the trip to Fianacial Aid and got everything squared away. Pistons won the NBA Championship last night, and there was much rejoicing.  With the Pistons being champions, a "promising" Lions season, the 2005 MLB All-Star Game coming to Comerica Park, and the Super Bowl coming to Ford's Field in 2006, the word Detroit will be passing through the lips of many Americans over the next few years.  It is going to be interesting to see how and if the city's image will change, and if it can actually make a turn around to a bonefide metropolis, as opposed to an industrial wasteland.

         It's Saturday.  It's close to 8pm.  I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go. Shannon's at a wedding shower for Susan.  Her betrothed is  urlLink Rudy , my good friend, who has to put an appearance in at the shower.  So all of those people are out of the picture until at least 10pm.  My brother isn't answering his phone, and  urlLink Ben  is probably still working.  I can't call my cousins or anything because I don't have the car.  Where's the car?  With Rudy, Susan, and Shannon.  Why didn't I drive her to the shower?  Because Shannon had to work, rush home to change, then rush back to get to the shower, which is on the other side of town. Yes, I know there is a party store and bar right by the house but A) Drinking alone makes me feel like an alcoholic, and B) My ATM/Check card has a tear in the strip which makes it useless in the ATM machines and credit card machines at the bar and party store.  I found that out when I walked over there earlier today.  Actually it was the second time I walked over there, because I get 25 feet in front of the party store only to realize that I had forgotten my wallet.  OUI! So while the  urlLink Reno 911 marathon on Comedy Central  is entertaining, I need, want, must get out of this apartment.  I want to get crazy and wild and say rude things.  I want to make off color jokes about priest's and small children while choking back the pre-vomit of beer and Jagermeister.  I AM BORED AND TRAPPED IN MY HOME!  PLEASE GOD, SEND ME SOMETHING TO DO!  SEND ME A HERO TO RESCUE FROM MY PRISON!

      HA! How's that for a pun?  There is a lot of hoopla about Michael Moore's upcoming release of Fahrenheit 911.  It's a documentary about the Bush administration’s midnight flight of the Bin Laden family after 9/11 and a host of other problems surrounding Iraq and the war on terrorism.  The hype comes from the right, and their ascertation that the film is filled with lies and half-truths concocted by the Michigan native, in an attempt to skew the American public as we near the upcoming elections.    Quote from  urlLink Conservative Petitions.    His "Fahrenheit 911" will be a political assassination piece which uses lies, exaggerations, twisted facts and unsubstantiated reports in an attempt to discredit President George W. Bush. It also will be a vile insult to the memories of the victims of 9/11, but that doesn't matter to Moore. To vent his personal wrath and bring down the administration as promised, Moore actually is willing to endanger all of us by inflaming our enemies in a crazed attempt to plant seeds of doubt among Americans and our nation's allies.     Quote from  urlLink The Triangle.   The fact of the matter is this: If you think Michael Moore is fine intellectual fare, you're not thinking enough when you watch his films. If you actually pay to see his movie, which is to say you give someone money to lie to you, I urge you in the strongest possible terms to get a vasectomy, because the world has enough idiots.      So I attacked Google repeatedly, trying to find the lies he is going to have in this film.  After entering Michael Moore's name, and the title of his film, I added terms like lies, fact sheet, inaccuracies, and other synonyms but I never stumbled across any listing of his supposed lies in Fahrenheit 911.  I found plenty of essays and comments on Moore's stupidity, poor interview and film editing techniques and how he hates America.  The deal is though, these cats haven't seen the movie.  They don't even hate Michael Moore.  They love being conservative.  They love the incendiary superiority.  They love feeling like they have a level of logic that the rest of America can't understand, and they use that feeling to fuel bile.  They hate democrats and liberals because they see them as stupid and in their arguments to prove them stupid, they cite examples of bad decision making and mishaps, never trying to see or understand the different view of politics and life in America the left has.  For them it's based in logic and hatred.  It's a way to hate blacks, gays, and women without saying it out loud.  It's a way to validate their privilege and wealth in a country where so many go without the two, and frankly, never will.  It has become an unstoppable vehicle of spin, so the world will remain only in shades of white and green, and as Fahrenheit gets closer to release, it is only going to heat up.  Do I think Moore is a puritan documentary filmmaker?  No.  He has a gonzo style of filmmaking designed to embarrass, and in the case of the Bush Administration in Fahrenheit 911, destroy those in the suits that hold so much sway over our lives.  He catches them off guard, he catches them unaware, and as the filmmaker, has complete control over how his material is presented on screen.  But I am holding off judgment until I see it.  WTF am I ranting about?  It boils down to this.  I can't stand politics right now.  People are spinning for criminals, they are discrediting respected public servants, the media isn't putting the information out in the open for all too see, the left looks sodomized and impotent, and the right has so much money and cult members... Nothing feels honest right now.  I don't know if I can put myself in this world.  At least in the Clinton years they felt like there was a balance.  Dem in the White House, Reps in congress, and an even Court.  But there is no balance to anything right now, and it all feels like it is out of control.    I am very intrested in eberyone's opinion on this, so leave a comment.

      It's being reported and repeated on all the gaming message boards,  urlLink True Fantasy Live Online  has been  urlLink cancelled .  I cannot begin to express my disappointment in this matter.  It was to be a MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) with cel-shaded, toon style graphics and the ability to get a job as a shop keeper, blacksmith, or any such thing as opposed to endless combat.  It was one of the reasons why I bought an Xbox, and its cancellation is one of the reasons why I am considering selling my Xbox on ebay.  I'm deadly serious.  It never showed up at this year's E3 after making a huge splash at the 2003 E3.  Rudy and I planned on getting this game, quitting our jobs, and alienating our  urlLink loved ones  to this game.  Looks like we gotta find something else.   urlLink FUCK !

      Clear Channel nixed an anti-war group’s proposed message on one of its NYC billboards citing it was distasteful to the community.  Foul some will say, but there is nothing that can be done about it.  It's privately owned by CC, not by the city, therefore, 1st Amendment rules do not apply.  Clear Channel is also responsible for that Dixie Chicks flap last year, as well as the canceling of Howard Stern in six radio markets this year.  A billboard against the war, a pop group against the war, a shock jock against the war... all thrashed by a company that owns over 1000 different radio stations across the country.   When the FCC decided to nix its policies of disallowing media companies like Clear Channel from owning too many radio stations or media outlets in the same market, some people went bonkers claiming it was going to mess up the way free speech is handled.  A small group owns the majority of outlets that disseminate information and/or entertainment.  This allows these corporations to squelch, change, or decide what messages you and I get to hear.  In effect this eliminates the old, "Don't like it?  Change the channel," argument, because the next channel, owned by the same company, is doing the exact same thing. The sanest argument for capitalism I ever heard came from Rudy Senior at Rudy Junior's bachelor party.  He argued that a free market will, eventually over time, reflect the morality, and truth of the society that uses it.   Example:  Bob hates slavery.  Company X produces a cola using slaves.  Bob stops buying X-Cola.  Cindy loves slavery.  She buys X-Cola everyday.  Eventually, the Bob's and Cindy's of the world decide whether or not X-Cola can stay in business.  If X-Cola, or any other private company owns ALL of the cola's, how will the market decide what is moral, indecent, and just plain silly?

      Picked this one up at  urlLink Fresburger Blog (click here to see what I am talking about) .  Utterly mind-fucking-blowing.  What if in this state, every doctor or pharmacist took this policy?  Think about what a woman would have to go through, what generic, unapproved crap she would have to take in order to stay healthy, or exercise a basic desire to not become pregnant.  The pill isn't about just sex; it's about choice.  And it's about men in power taking the unneeded role of moral parent.  A Patient's Bill of Rights could go a long way to ensure that any and all medications and treatments would be open to the willing, regardless of a health professionals personal creed or mission.  The power of life is in a woman's hands.  Man can bring the gift of life, and any woman is welcome to reject that gift is she so pleases. Is the new era of censorship going to happen this way?  Clear Channel set a precedent when they censured and fired Howard Stern.  A private organization simply choose what was best for it's listeners, regardless of ad revenue and listener support.  What if McDonald's tomorrow stopped serving burgers to the obese?  It's fully in these companies right to do so, and maybe we have taken for granted the money hungry nature of these corporations. I just can't believe that any doctor of any type would refuse to give treatment.  They can recommend, they inform, they can educate, but at the end of the day, shouldn't they be obligated to carry out the wishes of the patient?  Editor's Note: The above link has been changed.  The title for the post is: Reason #67583 to hate Nutjob Fundies.  Sorry!
