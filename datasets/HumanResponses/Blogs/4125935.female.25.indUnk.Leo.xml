       the day of which we do not speak is over    My age is higher, but I'm really not older I guess 'cause you can't age a whole year in just one day.   Well I guess if you like got hit by a train it might make you feel really bad and old........what?   Let's see, it didn't really suck too bad at all.   The boy and my love and I went to the State Fair.  It was pretty cool.  I took a lot of pictures, some of them not so cool, some of them pretty ok.  I am TIRED from it, from the walking.  When I laid down in bed it felt so good.  It was a tired I had earned instead of tired simply from sitting around and doing nothing.    Well hey wow look it's time for me to get ready for work.  Yippie working the weekend is just so so so dandy fun.

       I sit here with my nails painted...'wet paint' the sign would say if they had a sign on them.   I did the little girl thing and painted every other one green and every other one pink.    I have accepted the inevitble birthday that approaches.   I decided trying to avoid it was useless and vain.  What's the big deal anyway?  I hve everything to live for and I'm still alot younger than some people.   I am completely uninspired.

       I've got this really bad pain in my back like right in the middle like someone stuck a knife right there.  Yet my love wonders why I have trust issues!  How the heck can I learn to trust anyone if the people I thought I could trust go around stabbing me full-on in the back.  I guess my life is just one bad choice after another.        I feel like going shopping.  But today I have my physical for my new job at 3.  Maybe after that I'll go.  The boy and I went for a picture-taking ride this morning before lunch.  I had a few moments of aggravation when this ugly white Ford Ranger with red decals on the side decided to ride my bumper and try to exert peer pressure on me to go faster.  I get really irritated at people that follow too closely, you know who you are.

       why must antibitoics cause yeast infections? what the heck is the point.  They need to just come in, do their job and leave without causing all the problems that result when the flora of your body is killed off.  I guess it's one of those times when truly you can't have it all.  Yes, my dear this Keflex will help your leg heal from cellulitis so it doesn't have to be amputated but as if it isn't enough to have cellulitis now you will be throwing up, with diarrhea and a yeast infection.  I GIVE UP.  Maybe I should have let the cellulitis go and then I never would have had to deal with this.  By the way I have a nearly full bottle of 500mg Keflex if anyone wants it.  Yeah I know they tell you to take all of it even if you feel better.....(I didn't go to nursing school for nothing) but I ain't gonna do it.  My leg is fine.  Some things maybe should just be left alone.      I start my new job soon.  I don't know exactly when but I have quit the nursing home yippiiieeeeee.  I am so sick of the management wishing to line their own pockets instead of take care their employees so we can take care of the residents which in turn would line their pockets but when you're a selfish rich person you don't always see that right away until someone sues you and then you are forced to.        my virus scan has detected a virus how dare someone infect me!

       watch Backdraft, or recall it.  No, no the sex scene on the firetruck, but when they'd open a door and that ball would burst through.   Yah that deadly and beautiful ball of fire.  Think about anything you've seen where an airplane door or window goes out way up in the air.  (think: Fight Club, U.S Marshals)   Think about it for a minute.  Think about the sound it makes.  The rush, the roar, the pulling you may feel.   Think about it.   Think about opening a heavy door against the wind.   I did something last night that I regret.  I had a curiosity that I did not want to ignore.  Not all curious urges need be acted on.  My life is an ongoing example of that fact.    I will not give details much.  That is not what maters.  Once again she is greiving for me, this grand firend of mine known fondly as "Spirit Chick" (which reminds me she needs a new name as that one was given nearly 10 years ago when it was cool to be called a chick).  I wrote the account down in my journal, half asleep so I recalled not what I wrote until this morning when I read it.  I'm glad I did that, wrote in my sleep.  I was honest then, honest with myself.   In the Lion King, Mufasa appears in the clouds and tells Simba "remember who you are."  I have a hard time remembering how important it is that I remmber who I am and who I belong to.        To put things simply, I went on a "ghost hunt" with some friends and with my love.   The place we went is well known in this area and beyond to those who belive in the spiritual things.  Troy Taylor thinks  it is a portal.   Who is Troy Taylor?  He writes books.  He has exspenive equipment.    urlLink http://www.prairieghosts.com   if you want to know.   My issue is not really as much what happened, but that it actually happened.    My spirit feels....raw.  Like it's been raped, or road rash or sunburn or all of the above.  Rape is more accurate.  I think that we experienced something last night that very few people ever have.   I can honestly say I have never been so terrified in my life.  Yes I've been scared.  Like the night I walked through the streets of Cuenca alone.  Or the time I had that spider on me, sticking it's web to my skin.   God doesn't leave me....I just get away.  Think of it like a little kid.......a little kid with its mama at the mall.  Mama doesn't leave the kid, kid wanders off.  It's happened to you...I know it has...you get surrounded by strangers, can't see mama.  You know how that feels, to look up and she's gone.           OK take all the sensory images I have given you....hold them in.   Don't call me crazy...believe this or don't.  But don't call me crazy if you don't believe.  Parallel to our puny pathtic vapor of a life on earth is the "spirit world."  I cannot speak for my 2 friends or my love when I say this.....you'll have to ask them.   But I really really really feel that last night, sitting in the back of my friend's Stang....that the door to their world flew open and they swarmed us like a swarm of bees.  I felt them all over me, pawing me in my very soul.  Like a little kid whose mama isn't left, just on the other side of these strangers.  The noise?  Like wind, laughing, screaming, grumbling, terror.  So, no more ghost hunts for me.  My mind is left with questions.......this is not the first time He's made me privy to that world.  Not the last.        at least I know Uncle George is NOT there.....

        I noticed today, while out driving, that the trees and other various green plants are beginning to lose their summer luster.  Not really changing colors yet but not the deep luscious green of May/June/July.  It makes me sad.  But fall is nice, for different reasons.  It brings the snow of course eventually so that is good.   I will never forget when I went to Ecuador for 2 weeks in August of 1998.  When I left at the beginning of the month,  all was right with the world, the corn was thick and green and smelled so grand and the trees were bright and heavy with their green leaves.  When I returned 15 days later, the corn was yellowed and whispy, and the trees were painting themselves any color but green.   Now that I am not in school any more, fall holds no terror for me.   When I was little, my heart would sink with despair when WalMart would put out the back-to-school stuff.    Now it brings to my mind day trips to look at trees, cool nights for hot chocolate, wiener roasts and bonfires.   But as we've found true, the weather will be cool, but the the first week of school it will become hot again.    Never fails.     ["You have been more faithful than the morning sun, You have been more faithful than knowing night will come, You have been more faithful than the changing of seasons."]

       my arm is sore today.  I know that may not matter to anyone, it barely matters to me.  It is a minor annoyance that is easy to deal with.  While I'm complaining, I may as well tell anyone that is reading about how my stomach feels like a can of worms on crack that are about to devour each other in a wave of insane rage.  What a lovely way to describe nausea, my dear.  At this current moment, the boy is in his playpen screaming.  Just his normal occasional screams.  He was in here with me, standing in his crib but he began screaming in my ear and I thought he could take his nap in his box.  He is not napping.  I have put this stuff in my hair, this cholesterol stuff that feels like death and holds my hair like glue.  It's purpose is to soften and strengthen my hair...we'll see.  Soon I will take a shower and the boy and I will get in Sangria and go for a drive.  We will sing.  Probably today will be lots of "did you ever see the faces of the children they get so excited" over and over because I love to sing that.        Today is Tuesday, and I am off today.  I am off on Friday yippie and will more than likely do nothing then as well.        The boy is not napping.  I am assuming he would prefer to nap in the car while I sing like Ann-Margaret.
