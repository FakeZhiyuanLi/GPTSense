						   out in the pouring rain...cuz i love you...and i always will.  Anyway, today was like...hello...Too hot. And aack...Huey!!! C'mon so many negatives? :-(  I feel like I should say something but what? You know you'll be really successful...All you need is faith. Cuz I have a whole bunch for you!  I also applied somewhere else to work at and I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that I get it. It's for the 3-11 shift though and I hate working in the afternoons...I totally prefer the mornings but oh well...I need the work and the money so I'll accept it ya know?  Anyway, enough about that stuff....Today...I'll probably hang out with my boyfriend...again. lol.. You know, you can only sick of it so many times. haha. But then again...I love him so it's fun and really great.  Atleast now I can spend as much time with him before I start working and school gets in. Then it'll be really hard to do anything because work and school always comes first on my list.  You know Huey...life gets hard....but all you need to do is pick yourself and dust yourself off and try again. :-)  Anyway, I'm out. Too hot to sit here and type. lol.

						   Beauty queen of only eighteen She had some trouble with herself He was always there to help her She always belonged to someone else  I drove for miles and miles And wound up at your door I've had you so many times But somehow I want more  I&nbsp;don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  And she will be loved She will be loved  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful  I know I tend to get so insecure It doesn't matter anymore It's not always rainbows and butterflies It's compromise that moves us along  My heart is full and my door's always open You can come anytime you want  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  And she will be loved She will be loved  I know where you hide Alone in your car Know all of the things that make you who you are I know that goodbye means nothing at all Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved  [in the background] Please don't try so hard to say goodbye Please don't try so hard to say goodbye  Yeah  [softly] I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain  Try so hard to say goodbye    copyright Maroon 5 @ 2004

						    you know what i figure? life isn't always as you picture it...yea i know....cliche words or what? but it's so true.    &nbsp;  for the first time in my life....i  felt  the changes and still survived them with my friends...you know...when people grow up....yea they change. But if you think about it...if somebody changes, could you really accept them for their true self after...or would it be too much?    &nbsp;  i never knew the answer to that until now...It's amazing the things you learn as you grow...and you know, i've still got a lot to go before i get to where i want to be...and i'm  hoping ... praying ....that i will get there, along with my friends, the people i  love .    &nbsp;        &nbsp;  Awwwww.....Aren't we cute??? *grins*  And now.... Ladies and gents...Hold onto your shorts....Believe me when I say....this will be the   HOTTEST   thing you've ever seen!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Aw shoot!! Damn....Now if I was single.... *grins* Love ya hue!

						     This song came into my life at the most appropriate moment and I realize that maybe not many people will read this but I hope that those who do....realize what this means.          Grew up in a small town     And when the rain would fall down     I just stared out my window     Dreaming of what could be     And if I'd end up happy     I would pray (I would pray)          Trying not to reach out     But when I'd try to speak out     Felt like no one could hear me     Wanted to belong here     But something felt so wrong here     So I pray (I would pray)     I could breakaway      [Chorus:]     I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly     I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky     I'll make a wish     Take a chance     Make a change     And breakaway          Out of the darkness and into the sun     But I won't forget all the ones that I loved     I'll take a risk     Take a chance     Make a change     And breakaway      Wanna feel the warm breeze     Sleep under a palm tree     Feel the rush of the ocean     Get onboard a fast train     Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)     And breakaway      [Chorus]     I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly     I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky     I'll make a wish     Take a chance     Make a change     And breakaway          Buildings with a hundred floors     Swinging around revolving doors     Maybe I don't know where they'll take me     But gotta keep moving on, moving on     Fly away, breakaway      I'll spread my wings     And I'll learn how to fly     Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye     I gotta take a risk     Take chance     Make a change     And breakaway          Out of the darkness and into the sun     But I won't forget the place I come from     I gotta take a risk     Take a chance     Make a change     And breakaway, breakaway, breakaway    @ copyright 2oo4 Kelly Clarkson

						   you know what i learned from all the experiences i had with my friends? it's that to be true to them and yourself because it's the only way to be a good friend to someone.  look huey, you know i'll be up as late as whenever to talk to you. that's how it works for us. it doesn't matter what time it is, it never has. dun take that particular day..or morning and apply it to everything else from now on. you know it would never work anyway because we're both up late all the time.  all i have to say is and this will be the last time i comment on it...you are NOT stupid....you were not being imma....ok, you were. lol...ok, just kidding....but seriously, we fought because both of us were frustrated and had gone through some things that night and you obviously needed someone to talk to and i couldn't be that person that night. it may have largely been because of what happened earlier that night but it shouldn't have taken it out on you. but the thing is...what i said that night...i still believe and what i said in xanga, i will hold true to. i want to help, i really do but it's not my situation and it's not my relationship.  i dun want to be repetitive so i won't keep repeating myself but i will be there for you as much as possible. i will be there when you need someone to listen to, i will be there when you need someone to bitch to, but i will not be giving advice because on that stand, you need to figure it out yourself and i know you're stronger and you know you're stronger and you can do it.  things happen in life...i get it but each experience is different for each of us and we all handle it with different choices...therefore you must learn from your own mistakes and not take knowledge from mine because then...you'll never know the way life is suppose to be.  and yes, it'll hurt...but.....oh my lordy....i'm preaching again, aren't i? *sigh* alright, i need to stop...i believe this will be my last post here at the blog because i prefer xanga and it's easier for me...yes i'm too lazy to care for two....*shrugs*  anyway, i won't preach anymore and i'll let YOU live YOUR life.  smile sweety, it's meant to get better.   love ya always....  peace ppl i'm out... :-)
