						   Yes...it has been awhile since my last blog. I have been working quite a bit and just plain too tired to think let alone write. This week I have been spending my evening watching the Democratic convention and I am please on how well the speeches have been. This has been the best convention I have seen in many of decades.&nbsp;I urge all you&nbsp;Democrats to get out there and vote and for all you undecided to seriously consider voting Democrat. More importantly everyone must vote their conscience regardless what&nbsp;their sentiments are--the message is to vote!!!   &nbsp;

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has been a busy week and have not had the time to write as much. So much going on through my head this week. Pressing issues such as will I upgrade my computer to XP. Will I use my new picture phone for good or evil. Will my cat stop throwing up her meal on my carpet. Can I stop laughing at these fashion hounds that do not have the balance and body strength to walk&nbsp;upright&nbsp;in the clunky heels or the skimpy sandals with the spiked heels. Will my ex boyfriend that I recently broke up with stop calling me every night just to "chat". Will Martha Stewart become some woman's "Bitch" while she is in prison. My mind is stewing over these things as I write!  &nbsp;  Oh well...a glass of wine, Jim Brickman playing on the stereo and one of my fat cats curled on my lap just may bring me back to a calm place in my head!

						        The boyfriend called! We discussed our situation and worked through a reasonable compromise. We decided to date on occasion than deal with those expectations of a committed relationship. He seemed happier and I felt relieved. Problem solved!      I have other matters I have to deal with such as an annoying neighbor that goes out of her way to be intrusive. My neighbor (lets just call her "nasty arrogant girl"--"Nag for short")had a terrible habit of leaving her loft for days at a time but not disabling her alarm clock that would go off about 6:30 a.m.  and left unattended will continue to blast a nasty little high pitch alarm  for about an hour that I swear has summoned bats! I left a friendly little note last year asking if she could disable her alarm before she left and if she had any problems with say my television or radio being too loud that just let me know. Well...this had festered!       Apparently, she is one of those people that can't be asked to adjust her noise levels and she followed with an action that I deemed one of the most rude and childish behavior in history. She managed to turn up her TV very loud on a nightly basis (she use to be quiet over there), turned on her stereo loud and late (Once at 4:00 a.m. in the morning) and topped it all off with a little alarm clock theatrics. She must have one of those duel alarms because not only was the alarm going off left unattended but another started just as one stopped. Recently, she added a new attraction of what sounds like a bird alarm clock that not only annoyed me but other neighbors that has loft is in the same vicinity.      Now will someone tell me what kind mind would deliberately break their own patterns of comforts just to piss others off. I am  not talking a one time get even thing here...I am talking weeks of small annoyances that I am sure are more of an inconvenience to her than to me. Hell..the energy of the rage alone must consume her (lol)! Well needless to say, I did get the building manager involved to silence this crap which he has been sort of effective. The lofts where I reside are big but the walls are thin. Heck, if I was developer with a lot of space to fill and with plenty drywall I probably do the same thing (lol)!

						        Well I am new to this Blogging thing but I thought I would give it a try. I have never been very good with journals as I am prone to very negative prose illustrating depressing streams of thought. My problem was that I was (am) to quick to compare my life with others--that is others that have (in my mind) ideal lifestyles (lol). I guess I never really worked on the life I had and deluded myself with thoughts on of a life I thought I should have! Well..in order to work on myself I thought if I wrote and later revisited what I wrote I could maybe somehow see myself in a newer light.       Who am I? I am a 42 year old African American Female (please if you don't mind I rather say "Black"--sometimes being politically correct is just way too much of a mouthful). I am college educated with a music degree which I am doing nothing with. I am presently working in Corporate America for an insurance company in a job that is about 90% of the time boring and beneath me but this is a normal rant of about 75% of the working millions in this country today! I live in loft (about 1100 sq Ft) in the downtown district of a major mid-west city. I am an avid reader with a library of about 600 books and I have three cats. I am also Democrat and a Liberal which even in these times I am proud to say care about the quality of my fellow human beings lives and many of the government programs that help people survive. That is not to say I do not believe in Welfare Reform as I think it is necessary but I digress!       The interesting thing about me is that although I care for the quality of lives I am not much of a people person. Since I was a child I have been solitary in nature and realized for the 1st time just recently that I like it that way. You are reading about a woman that had lamented for many years of not having a "significant other" and now I have someone in my life that I do not want!  What is a woman to do?  That is the question I leave for myself tonight. Perhaps I can explore this topic more in days to come!
