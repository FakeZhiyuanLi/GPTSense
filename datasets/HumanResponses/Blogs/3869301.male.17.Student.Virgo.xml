      All of you who love me can find my ramblings over at my parent site http://rickscales.com. I doubt there are any of you that could not figure that out. Oh how I will miss you blog. We had such a short time together.

      I would like to thank Rick Scales for that small news post. It is stuff like this that really pops my tarts. I hope all of you reading this blog who can vote will vote for Kerry. I am.  I finished reading Watership Down. It is only the second book I have ever read that I think I will tell everyone to read. It is filled with adventure, suspence, and vivid imagery. Truely a great work.  I got a letter in the mail from myself. All of you from AGS probably did too. I had forgoten all about that day in Area III sitting next to Halley, that math chick that was in both my Area II and II classes as a way for the powers that be to toy with me, when I wrote this letter. I will probably produce the letter with commentary tonight if I get around to it. I think it is rushed but informative about my psychie then and now.

Jesus Christ people.  Get this guy the fuck out of my whitehouse  ""All the information requested of staff, volunteers and participants for the event has been done so to ensure the safety of all those involved, including the vice president of the United States," he said."

      I listen to much music and dislike much of it. I have decided that I dislike so much because I don't relate. Love and hate are abstract concepts to me. I talk about them, or at least think about them, alot. I hate that. There has never been anything that has rasied my feelings to either of those extreams. I use the words, but I don't mean them. I guess I love my family. You're kind of suppost to or something like that. I have pined, loathed, lusted, and cursed but never loved or hated. So many people I know who are my age have told me that they have felt love or hate. I often wonder whether or not they really have. If so I don't know why I haven't. Maybe it is because I just don't give people the chance. Maybe it is because I don't give myself a chance. Maybe I have loved or hated and just don't know...  Show me love/ Show me what it's all about  I liked Catwoman for it as a movie that you go in with kind of low expectations and come out saying, "That was okay enough." At least I can say that it was better than what the hick with an awesome mullet I was behind in the line for tickets said about it with a deep woods twang, "Catwoman? I heard that movie succccks."  About one quarter of the book left for Watership Down. Awesome book. I will have a review up soon maybe if Andy gives me more than just my blog. There will be a psydo review in the blog though. I have a bet going that I will finish it before my sister finishes reading Catch-22. She has been reading that book for about two months now.

      Mandy Bird... Back when I went to church I went to a Catholic church (the only organized Christian religion I can stand, probalby because it is like a fast food chain:  uniform everywhere) I had church school on Wed. nights. Because my church was on the other side of the lake in Heber Springs and no one from my school was Catholic I knew no one at church outside of chuch. There was this girl though, Mandy, she was from Heber and she was in my class. I had the hugest crush on her. She was kind of a stick with brown hair and glasses. I stopped going to classes at some point. I don't know exactly why... I soon forgot about her, untill this year. The 2nd dumbest guy in my AP English class and the biggest asshole I know tells the class that he has a new girlfriend. Who other than Mandy... Through my few experiances with her of recent I have found her to quite different than I left her. She is now drinks alot and has a less than piete chassie. The following are selected pieces of conversation we had yesterday...  INT CHILLI'S, EXTERIOR  Mandy:  (she has a black shirt on with a wide slit down the middle so you can see her chest while her bra holds her breasts out of sight) Blake, can you see my bra? Blake:  (not looking and flatly) No. Mandy:  (turned around and half bending over) Blake is my but sweaty? Blake:  (not looking) No. Mandy:  You didn't look! Blake:  (not looking) John did. Mandy: (turned around and totally bending over and backing toward me) John, is my but sweaty? end scene  INT CHILLI'S, INTERIOR  We are all sitting at a long half-booth, half-table. The door opens and I look around and see a large girl that is not happy and is definately not pretty in the face.  Mandy:  I think that girl is good looking don't you guys? Amanda:  She's kind of pretty. Me:  Meh. Mandy:  Do you not think she is pretty, John? Is it because she is a large girl? Me:  No, I didn't like her because of her face. Mandy:  Because she had the same body type as I do. You don't want some stick girl. You gotta have some cushin for the pushin'. Me:  I am all for your body type I just didn't think she was good looking. Mandy:  You think I ugly, don't you? end convo  Same place. We are across from eachother mind you. Mandy turns to her right a bit too fast and she almost comes out of her top. She is apropriately embarassed.  Me: (turning my head so she can't she I am laughing) Blake:  You've embarassed John now. First the sweaty butt thing now this. Mandy:  John's not embarassed. Are you John? Me:  Not at all. I don't get embarassed most of the time. I was just laughing. Mandy:  See I could do this (she grabs her CC range breasts and moves them up and down a few times) and he wouldn't be embarassed. Me: tehe  Maybe if her and Blake ever break up I can hook up with her. She might be fun in the sack after a little booze.

      So right after my last post Amanda pulls up, and we are off. She immediately starts bitching about how everyone who is suppost to go to this thing is not convoyiing  as planned. After picking up this girl that reminds me of a thinner but less attractive version of "That Bullard Girl" we are off to Chili's. I hate Chili's. I drank too much tea while we were waiting for everyone to get there... Then we rushed off to the concert. I hate Puddle of Mudd, Nickleback, and 3 Doors Down. I don't hate them so much as I hate the people that listen to their music. Smelly, Drunken, Shirtless people. Any way the best part of the concert was the expensive port-a-pottie. It was just like Dale Gribble's on King Of the Hill. I still have the stamp on my hand that lets me back in. It was a one time payment of 5 dollars. It was so worth it after all that tea at Chili's. On the way back I got Amanda her lemonade that she wanted. After she drank it all I dared her to throw the half of lemon that was in her cup. She wouldn't so I did. When I did this guy next to me who probably had about 15 years on me pokes me and shakes his head at me. If it was not for the fact that he was about a foot and a half taller than me I would have punched him in the jaw. That douche has no right to tell me what to and not to throw into the backs of people with better seats than me! After the concert I went to Waffle House with Amanda and that Bullard-like girl. I enjoy waffles, hashbrowns, and coffee in the middle of the night. I drove Amanda's Izuzu Trooper home from there. I really don't care to drive big cars.  Many of you frequent readers might have noticed the name of this blog has changed. I decided last night that while some mainstream rock is okay I don't like the people and the lifestyle that is associated with fans of that genre. I have always hated A&F, American Eagle, and any other place that sells preppy ragged clothing. I only shop at Hot Topic and stores like that when I feel like spending way too much money on t-shirts. I also hate people that need to be drunk in order to enjoy eachother. I have made up my mind. I think I already am to a certain degree a hipster. I mean, I have never worn something because it is popular. (My Chucks I had before they became as annoyingly mainstream as they are now and I will keep wearing them after their popularity dies down!) I have always enjoyed music for it being kind of an art and have lashed out at those that said that N'Sync and the Spice Girls were artists. They were performers! I still do not feel too much like a hipster though. I am a hipster wantabe.

      I wish I could. It would make life easier if I did not have the burden of hope. In Hell I could kick back with the suffering and know that this is it. It's the uncertainty of hope that I hate.  I realized this when I was watching Donnie Darko with k-ray yesterday. I find her so damn sexxy but even if I got into a romance with her she oviously does not feel the same about me. So I just don't care any more.  I am going to Amanda's Little Rock celebration tonite. This will be depressing. I need to get out though.  Fingernail painting did not go so well. If any of my female readers what to get together, paint my nails, and see where that leads give me a ring. or a comment or something.

      The best part about the state was my wireless internet in my hotel lobby.  I really think that there has to be a God sometimes. Otherwise I would not see the humor in my life, and the way it plays jokes on me. Like the one where Amanda Dotson and k-ray both enjoy me as a friend but as far as I can tell want me as nothing more when I think it is ovious(sp that Andy or Sam can fix) that I really like them. It is ovious(sp) that they don't feel the same though. Oh well, hopefully the first week of college I will get something. I can go on lagging behind my friend Wheeler in the romance department. I mean, the guy is kind of nuts, but he gets more tail than I have ever had (and he has not gotten that much). I mean I understand Andy getting girls. He fits into a niche market with them. I am not so niche-y though.    Things I hope to have done by the time I update next:  1. Sleep 2. Go with Amanda to get her ears pierced 3. Spend precious time watching a movies with the Wheelers at the cabin   Find out where your niche is, and it will lead to riches. - Hank Hill

      I had a small gathering to say good-bye to one of my better friends last night. He is joining the navy. He ships off to basic this Sunday, but because I will be in the OK state I cannot say by later. I will miss him because of the sheer energy he brought to those around him. When he was in a good mood everyone around him was giddy. He also was the only friend I have ever had that has had a healthy romance with anyone that consisted of both a purely physical lust and a deep caring for each other. If I had to have a roommate at the cabin that was not some very attractive maid that wanted to keep the place tiddy everywhere but my bed, it would be him. I made him mad at me once when I told him that I did not approve of his girlfriend, and he shut me out of his life for around a month. I was wrong about that and wish I could truely make him see that I know that... I will miss having you around because you made me a different person that I liked. I will miss you Mr. Eric.  ...Anyway, I celebrated my friend Wheeler's b-day today. We got some movies that I know he will love and had some good eats. I hope he had a better b-day then he might have without me. He is going through alot right now.  I also bought some black fingernail paint today.

      FBLA NLC 2004  I went to a lot of boring "workshops" that sucked because they were nothing like what I expected. They were too "motivational" and not "educational." I did get 7th in my International Business contest.  The worst part of the week was the fact that most of the girls there were very sexxy. As I spent alot of time thinking about how pretty many of them are I came to a way of defining the words I describe them with. So I present you with: THE TROUTSMEG SCALE OF BEAUTY!! *dun dun daaaaa* It is devided into levels of rank as to what title is higher or lower in value than the others. Those on the same level are equal in value for you math-chalanged people. All examples are subject to change as is anyone not mentioned.  First Level  PRETTY:  This is the lowest on THE TROUTSMEG SCALE OF BEAUTY. It is not derogatory because I don't think most if any girls, or guys, are totally unpretty. I say "pretty" when she is not my type at the moment. This might be due to any number of factors from eyes to breasts to feet. Ex: Drew Barrymore  Second Level  SEXXY*: Someone who is "sexxy" must make me want to have sex with them. There are varying sublevels of this from ugly sexxy to eligent sexxy to kinky sexxy. This title is earned by me just looking at the person. Ex: Uma Thurman  Third Level  CUTE:  A "cute" girl is a girl that I find somewhat physically attractive because of what she says and the way she says things. A girl dubed "cute" has very high mobility in THE TROUTSMEP SCALE OF BEAUTY. She could move up the levels very quickly, but she also can go down as well. It all depends on our convesations and my mood. Ex: Katie Rainey  HOT:  A "hot" girl is a girl that I find somewhat mentally attractive because of what she looks like and does. Mobility is also high here too. Ex: Ariel  Forth Level  BEAUTIFUL:  This girl is both "hot" and "cute" with her mental and physical beauty. How I pine for this type of girl. Ex: Abigail   While I was in Denver I found the timezone to be godaweful. It does not jive with the rest of the U.S. and it attracts panhandlers. I hate people unproductive to society. I did also have a waitress wait on me that looked alot like Katie Rainey. She made me realize how cute I think Katie is.   *I spell "sexxy" with two X's because of the They Might Be Giants song "S-E-X-X-Y."

      It has been a tradition every year, except last year when I was at AGS, for the last three or four years that for my sister's birthday we get a party plater of chicken nuggets from Chic-fil-et. We get the big 200 count tray and see how many we can eat on the way home. I am sooooo full of nugget it is not funny. I think we have some left...  We got to the mall early today, so while my mother and sister went shopping for underwear or something I went to Suncoast. This is one of my favorate stores at the mall (my favorate is the EB, not EB Games, yet, and my third favorate is Build-A-Bear, because Laura Katherine works there and it is fun to drop in on her from time to time, to bad today she was busy with a party). At Suncoast though there is this kinda hot girl that I love talking with about movies. She is the only female I talk to regularly that knows movies as well as I do. So I am hanging out there chating with her about Kill Bill, the Star Wars trilogy finally being released on DVD, Donnie Darko vs A Walk to Remember, and such. Very soon after I get done discussing how Lucus can remaster Star Wars after it has been remaster at least three times already I realize I am smitten. As we talk I find Ginger is a ULAR student, a huge movie buff, perky friend to all customers, and SHE HAS A KID!!!! Fuck... Shit... Damn... While I was there I got Bubba Ho-Tep. So the vistit to the store was not a total loss.  I don't know if I will post tomorrow. I might if I have some time between packing stuff. I might also post something this week if I get to a computer, but you better not count on it. If Andy would quit macking on Sam for a few minutes and tweek the site a bit you might see less blah and more blog. Oh! I might also try to start writing movie reviews. I need to talk with Andy about a rating system because he had some good ideas for a rating system, but we need to perfect them. A universal ratings system for the rickscales dot com family of sites would be fun.  Now about those nuggets...

      I went and got some new dress clothes today for FBLA nationals. When I grow up I want to wear Dockers, button up shirts, and ties. It is a style that looks good I think. Stylish yet not overdressed for many average things.  I think it was this morning... I had breakfast with k-ray. I foregot how much I really do enjoy her. Just her being around makes me smile, but I don't know how to tell her this. I have never known. I have had these feelings for years. Times fades around her. If only she would ever give me a hint that she might, MIGHT, feel even sort of the same for me... Oh, I don't know what I would do.

      I went to volleyball tonight. It truely is the highlight of my week most of the time. I am not socially athletic by nature, but when I am with these people it is not so bad. At least I have a life beyond my computer with volleyball (no offeance Amy, Andy, Kelsea, et al).  I saw Deanna too...  In a song the Barenaked Ladies say, "When you die they make a list/Of every girl you never kissed." The song is about regreting the act of doing nothing. I regret not kissing about three, maybe four, girls I have ever met. I regret a lot of things, but these regrets haunt me the most.

      I went to Kelly's resturant today in Bald Knob. It was my sister's wish to do that. To do that with the Wheelers none the less. I feel near dead. We had a good time, but a little Wheeler goes a long way. A long road trip with the Wheelers goes a very long way.  Tomorrow I am going to have breakfast with k-ray. I have not seen her since May when we graduated. I have always had a crush on her and will forever have one on her. Unfufilled love... the product of a youth in which I did not understand why no one thought I was cool.

      Who will kill Micheal Morre...  I notice that I am always willing to make a friend, but usually want to run away from him/her five minutes after we meet. I am sure that in Mr. Morre's case it would be three and a half.
