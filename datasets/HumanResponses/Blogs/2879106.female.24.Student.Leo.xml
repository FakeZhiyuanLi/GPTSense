      I don't really want to talk about this too much, but I am on the verge of making a decision that will change my life. I am not sure which road I want to go down, but there is one thing for sure, I am at a crossroads and I have to choose a path. I am so confused and scared but I guess that's what life is all about. Why is it so hard to let go when you know that it is probably the right thing to do. Sorry about being so vague, but this is all I can say for now. I can say this though, "St. Jerome said something along the lines that a friend who leaves probably wasn't ever your friend to begin with." This isn't a direct quote but I think you get the idea. Thanks to everyone who has been there for me when I needed you. My only hope is that I can do the same for you.

      Hey there everyone reading this!!!! I am having a pretty good day today (although I still haven't sat down to read the book for history when a paper is due next week.) I started back on my workout today  because I was a little bad for a couple of day's. With all of the things going, I just didn't have time to worry about my diet.  I hope to stay on it and be very good from here on out.  Well for now that's all I really have to say.

      Hello everyone reading this!!!! Well yesterday I was very upset and I expressed my feelings on here. Although I don't want to take back what I said yesterday, I do want to add a little too it. I love my boyfriend very much and I never want to be without him. But I think we will have to make some changes very soon. I am a leo and he is a cancer. I am not sure if this has anything to do with how our relationship is going, but I know that am way too needy and he doesn't have the energy to give me as much as I want. By saying this I am by no means blaming either one of us (this is just the way our personalities are), and the fact is that I knew all of this going into our relationship. I guess I really need to be talking to him about this instead of crying about it on here. Let's all pray that we can figure this out and come to a compromise. I guess that's all I really want to say about that.  Next big thing is that I am so stressed out right now. I am trying to lose weight while working and going to school. Also I have a book report due next week and I haven't even started reading the book. I guess tomorrow I am going to have to do something about this. WHAH WHAH WHAH!!! Okay enough complaining about myself.   I guess the last thing I want to say today is that I am very happy with the way my life is right now. (Yes even with a relationship on the rocks, school, work, and trying to work out everyday) I just want to thank God for everything I have and no matter how bad things seem, things could alway's get worse. (Hell I could be working at TJMaxx with my life not going anywhere)

      Hello everyone!!! I am going to start this journal everyday as if someone is listening to what I have to say. Well this is the day after Valentines Day and I am so very pissed off. My Boyfriend (who I love so much) is the biggest jerk in the whole world. He was so selfish!!! Last night he never once thought to make V-Day special for me. I understand that he doesn't have much $$$$$ But I don't really ask for much. I just wanted a quite night TOGETHER!!!! Not a night of me watching TV and him ignoring my while he looks at his computer. What makes it worse is that today when I talked to him, he had no clue I was even mad. I guess I cry myself to sleep whenever I am truly happy!!(He is so clueless!!) OH well I guess that's what I get for falling in love with a selfish jerk. Sorry hunny if you are reading this but this is all true. Well That's all for now. Thanks for listening to me vent. I really appreciate it!! Love alway's

      I am so very stressed out right now. I have so many things going on in my life that I can't keep everything straight. I have been trying to study for classes but life just keeps me away from the things that I need to get done. I am trying to stay focused but it just seems to be too hard. I am on the verge of just giving up completely. Anyway enought bitching today. Let's just pray that I don't go crazy in the next couple of days. If I can just make it till friday everything will be okay.

      I know! I know! I need to write more often. I have just been busy doing different things and I have just forgot. But I am back and ready to tell you everything that has been going on in my life. I think last time I wrote me and Alek were having problems. Well things are going great in that area now. We have worked everything out and we are back better than ever. Everything is going well in other aspects of my life. Friends are great!!! School is okay!!! It's getting harder the closer I get to the end of the year but I am sure I will get through it. Lastly, Work!!!! I hate that damn place and I wish I wouldn't ever have to go back. BUT YOU KNOW BILLS BILLS BILLS!!!!! I have to work and I guess I just need to stop complaining about it. That's all for now I will write more later. LOVE YA!!

      Today's entry is going to be very short. I started back to Lonestar today and I am so very tired. My feet and legs are going to fall off. I am so out of shape and I remember serving being tiring but hell I don't remember the pain I am in now. I have to say that I was having nightmares about going back but really other than the pain in my legs and feet, the night wasn't all that bad. Now tomorrow may be another story. It is now 12:16am and I have to be up at 6:00am to be at American General at 8:00am. URGHHH Then when I leave AGI I have to be back at Lonestar by five. URGHHHH Oh well I really need the money.   One quick thing about Alek. He wrote me today and said that he will write me back tomorrow with his decision about our relationship. I hope everything in his letter is what I want. I guess though I should know what I want before I say that. I will keep you updated as to what happens with that. Love you bunches and bunches Royale

      Well things aren't going so well in my life right now. I have been doing a lot of soul searching trying to figure out where I belong in this world. Mainly the biggest problem in my life is that I think me and Alek are on the verge of a total melt down. I wrote him last night telling him that I want to separate in order for me to get the rest of my life together. I am not sure that I really want to separate from him. One one hand I love him with all of my heart and I don't ever want to be apart from him. Then on the other hand we are so totally different that it is hard sometimes for us to relate. He is going to be leaving to go to school in the fall and he will be 6 and a half hours away. They say that distance makes the heart grow stronger but I feel that if we are having trouble keeping things together when we live 20 mins apart, it will be almost impossible to work things out when he is in Illinois. What in the hell am I going to do???? I want to go over to his house right now and take him into my arms and have my way with him. I want to show him how much I love him and make him understand that we are meant to be together. But then reality sets in and I realize that isn't a solution. We can't just kiss and make up because this problem isn't just about some fight we had. (Our problems are much deeper than that!!!) Why can't we make this work??? Why does life have to be so hard???  Talking about life being hard. I am such a fuck up!!!! I can't pay my bills. I am in debt so bad that I can't see any light above me while I sit in this hole I have dug for myself. To make things worse I had to borrow money from my best friend just so I could keep my insurance from being cancelled. I am starting back at lonestar tomorrow and I am dreading it like no other. It was so humiliating last night when I had to call and beg Country to give me my job back. I felt so low that I just wanted to die. Everyone keeps telling me that it won't be that bad, but how can it not be. Also I am trying to go full time at American General. Once I do that, I am going to have to work 40hrs a week and go to school 15hrs a week come fall. That is going to be so hard and I am not sure I can even do it. My only hope is that an opening will surface so I can go to full time because if I don't I am not going to be able to go to school at all. Mom has threatened to take me out of school or Kick my ass out if I don't start getting caught up on my bills. I just can't let that happen because school is the only thing going right in my life.   Lastly, I hate everything about myself. I saw a girl the other day that at one time was my very best friend. She used to be my size and was just like me. (you know always looking to lose weight) Well she was so thin that I didn't even want to talk to her. It had nothing to do with her, I was just embarrassed for her to see me in my new even fatter state. Well we talked for a bit and she asked how I was doing. Of course I said great. "Me and Alek are great, Work is great, and School is better than ever!!!" Well in fact none of that is great because even with school we are on summer break and I am hating not being on campus. Well we didn't talk long because Amber was like "We have to go!!" I didn't ask her about her weight loss and I am not sure if I even want to know. I just don't understand how everyone around me can seem to do it and lose the weight and all I seem to do is fall on my face and into a big bowl of spaghetti. (which is what I am eating as I type this.) God I just wish things would change. I wish I could just snap my fingers and be in a fantasy world where everything is beautiful including me. I know that I just need to stop bitching and make things happen but for some reason I just love to be self destructive.  I guess I should end this blog with at least one thing that I am grateful for. This is not hard for me to answer because I know  what the most wonderful thing is in my life and that is my friends. They have all been so wonderful to me. They have been my biggest supporters, my shoulders to cry on, and even my financial help. Thank you guys for everything you have done for me and if you are reading this, I want you all to know that I love you very much. I could not make it through the hard times without you. I just hope that I prove to be the kind of friend you have been to me!!!!   I am sorry for bitching all the way through this blog but I haven't really felt like doing anything else right now. I know that things are going to get better and I know that I can get through anything that I work to achieve. I just have to keep moving and hopefully I will see the light soon. Love always Royale

      Well I am not at all sure what I want to write about today because really nothing has happened. I woke went to work at Lonestar, then came home. FUN FUN!!!! I needed to make about 80 dollars tonight which I did but then that damn tip share came and took my 80 dollars down to 67. FUCK THAT TIP SHARE!!!! Anyway I will make more tomorrow. Also Alek wrote me saying that he misses me. I am not sure what to think of that considering that missing me doesn't really mean "I want to be with you". Plus I am not all that sure that I want to be with him. Don't get me wrong I love him with all my heart and it is killing me to be without him. BUT I am just not sure if we are supposed to be together. I hate the way life throws you curve balls messing up everything that you thought was so right. It just really sucks!!!! OH WELL life is going to get better!! I mean hell it has already improved since last week. I just try to be optimistic about things in order to see that everything that happens in your life, happens for a reason. Maybe in a couple of weeks I will know why this has been happening to me and everything should be clear. I love myself very much and I hope you love yourself too. (That is if anyone is reading this)

      Well Let me see, I went out with a friend last night and we went to see a band in Mt. Vernon. As I sat listening I just kept thinking "wow I should call Alek because he would really like to see the guitar player." Or I would think, "Alek would be really great in this band, I wonder if they need a bass player?" It was so strange for me because at times I would not even think of his name I would just say "my boyfriend blah blah blah." Then I would say to myself "not my boyfriend... my EX-boyfriend" I just hate that so very much. I never wanted this to happen and I swear that this was the farthest thing from my mind when I wrote the first E-mail to him. I just needed time to fix my life and now I don't know if I have made it worse. I wish I knew what to do, I wish I could talk to him, and I wish this never happened. Well you know what the say about wishing. Wish in one hand and shit in the other.... blah blah blah (you know the rest) Oh well I did this so I guess I just need to live with it. Talk to you later.

      Well lets see I have talked to Alek and we decided to just let things be as they are for a while until we both have time to heal from this experience. I think that's going to be for the best. Maybe we were just holding on to something that wasn't really there to begin with just so we could have someone. I do know that I really do love him with all my heart but I am just not sure if we were meant to be together. So anyway I am doing pretty well considering. Actually I have had two very good nights last night and tonight. What is so funny I watched the movie Bad Santa both nights. Go Figure!!! Anyway I have had a little too much wine to drink tonight so I think I will go to bed. I promise when I am not so tipsy I will get you more up to date on the situation at hand.

      I am so very happy today. Yes I am writing this the first thing this morning, but I can just tell that today is going to be a great day. Let's see why am I so happy? Well to start with I just bought a new Harry Potter t-shirt. HELL YEAH!!! I have been wanting one so very much and it was nice to get one. Next my DAD is out of the hospital and I think he is doing well. I only heard him get up out of bed once last night, which is better than his usual every thirty min trips to the bathroom. I hope this time we can keep him out of that damn hospital. Lastly, I just want to tell you about my wonderful night last night. Let's see to start out with, other than my trip to the mall to get the Harry Potter t-shirt, I tried on jeans in vanity. Wow they fit. I think I have lost about five pounds this week and I plan to keep that up. Also me and Amber went to play pool and we had so much fun. There was this hot guy there with his girlfriend, but for some reason he would go out of his way to stay in staring view of me and also make little comments when I walked by. I didn't say anything to Amber about that because I am not trying to Talk to anyone right now (especially someone with a girlfriend). DID I MENTION THAT HE WAS HOT!!!!! Okay, I have to admit that I was thinking about taking him out back and it was flattering to know that I still have the touch to turn heads. Okay I need to stop thinking about the guy at the pool hall. Did I tell you that I won almost all the games against Amber. HELL YEAH I did!!!! Okay I suck really bad and she is better than I am but she would clean the table and then for some reason scratch on the 8ball. HEHEHE I WIN!!! It was just an all around good night. Thanks to Amber for being such a great friend.

      I have been thinking about how all I have really been doing is bitching about my life on here lately. I don't want this blog to be nothing but negative shit. Instead today I am going to write about something positive.   Today I am going to write about friends:  First there is my best friend and soulmate Amanda K. She is so special to me and I want to thank her so much for being there for me and being my confidant. I truly believe that she is the one person in my life that I was supposed to meet to complete me. Too bad I am not gay huh.. HEHEHE To be serious for a moment, I really do love Amanda because she is a ray of sunshine in my life and I know that anytime I need her she will always be there for me. There is no one in the world that I can have such long, deep conversations with and I would never trade our talks on the back porch for anything. We can sit for hours talking about nothing and everything all at the same time. I wish every friendship could be like that. I would also like to say that I can't mention Amanda without mentioning Mike. He is like a brother to me and I couldn't ask for a nicer or more honest guy to have in my life.  Next there is Nicole. As you all know she is known as my savior. If it weren't for Nicole I wouldn't me here to write in this blog and I will never be able to thank her enough. Nicole has been in my life longer than anyone else and it is because of her that I wake up everyday and try to make something of myself. She is the one person that I would most like to be like because of her passion, determination, and compassion. She tells me all the time to bring her down off my pedestal but I just simply can't. In my opinion there is no one in the world that is more perfect than she is.  This now brings me to Amber. As of right now I do not have a title for Amber but she is like a sister to me. I would never be able to make it through the day without her encouragement. She is the reason I know that I will survive. She pushes me to be the best that I can be and it is because of her that I am now making something of myself. Plus she is the reason that I can now go to the mall and not worry if I spend too much money on a t-shirt. She will never know how MUCH that means to me. Also no one in the world can make me laugh like she does. We have so much fun together that all it take is seeing her to make me smile.  Last but not least there is Alisha. There is nothing really to say about Alisha but that she is my eternal optimist. I have never found anyone in my life who can see the silver lining the way she can. She is also my psychic friend. I will never have to call a one nine hundred number again. Also even though she is the most preppie of my friends, I love her just the same. Alisha is the one person I know that can make me happy to be alive and see that tomorrow is going to be a brighter day.  I have so many more friends than just these four girls but I have to say that they are the reason for living.  But I would like to acknowledge some other people before I end this blog. Of course there are my parents who put up with me when they probably could have just kicked me out a long time ago. There is my sister who will always be the most beautiful girl I have ever known. There is my high school friends that I still keep in touch with. When we get together it's like we have never been apart. Lastly, there are my friends at Lonestar and American General who make it bearable to go to work.   For now that is everyone that I can think of. If I have forgotten you it's only because it is so late at night and I am just tired. If you are really mad about it just E-mail me and I will get you into my next blog. I PROMISE!!! Love you all and thank you for everything that you have done for me in my life. My only hope is that I can be as good of a friend to you as you have been to me.

      Well I have been waiting for Alek to E-mail me. I was hoping that he would have something to tell me considering that we are ending a two and a half year relationship. I guess I was wrong to think that he cared considering that he hasn't wrote. I have been trying so hard to fix the problems that we are having and instead of helping me control the pain I am in right now, he is dragging the pain out. I just can't do this anymore. He is making me hate him. I want to call him or E-mail him in order to tell him that he is an asshole. On the other hand, I just want this to be over. I just don't know what to do and I hate myself for feeling this way. I promised myself that I would never put myself in a situation where I could be hurt. Now here I am in pain. What a fucking stupid idiot I have been.

      As I said yesterday, I would explain everything that has been going on today. Well The other day I E-mailed Alek saying that I wanted to separate for a while in order to work on things that are going on in my life. I asked him to E-mail me back by Friday in order for me to know how he feels about my decision. Friday came and all I received was a two line E-mail saying that he was busy and his response would have to wait till the next day. I was completely fine with that and was grateful for a notice on when he would respond. Then on Saturday I received nothing at all. I was so pissed off that he was such a jerk that I wrote him back and broke everything off. I informed him that I wanted to get my things back and I would make plans to come and get them after work on Sunday. So he called my phone and said that he would have my things in his car at the elementary school down the street and I would be able to come get them without having to come to his house. He was playing Basketball while Amber got my things out of his car. I tried to not look at him but I couldn't help it. I just stared wondering what he was thinking about as we drove away. I was told that he looked our way as we pulled away and Amber flipped him the bird, but I am not sure about that because I was too busy trying to get away as fast as possible. I just wish things didn't have to end this way. I love him so much and I can't stand to be away from him. I just wish I understood why he is acting this way. Why is he so insensitive? Why can't he just tell me how he is feeling? Why does he not have the courage to leave me himself? Why does he push me away so much that he forces me to make the decisions? Why can't he just be a MAN about this? I have decided that men of my generation have been raised to be spineless, week, jellyfish and that there are no good, strong, Marlboro men left in the world.   All I know is that I don't want to feel this way anymore. I am just a shell of a person wondering around from one of my jobs to another. I am going through the movements of my day and not feeling a damn thing. It is a real shame that I have to do this but if I don't just cut myself off from my emotions, I break down and cry. (while you are standing at a table taking orders, crying isn't the best way to get a big tip) So I just put on my fake smile and get through the day. I hate feeling this way so much and I wish I could just flip a switch and be back to normal. I guess I have gone through this before. I have dealt with men who can never seem to give you the answers you need. So I guess I am strong enough to get through this too. I just hope I get over it soon.  For some reason I am looking forward to being alone for a while. I am not going to jump into another relationship any time soon. I haven't been alone for about six years and I can't even remember what it is like to be a single woman. Maybe this time I will learn how to be strong and secure with myself without a man in my life.  One last thing, Dad is still in the Hospital. I hope he gets well soon and comes home. I feel really bad because I haven't been able to go and see him in the hospital. I have been working so much that I am either at work or asleep. Also yesterday I went to get my things. I told day what I was doing and why I couldn't come to see him. I think he understood. At least I hope he understood. He should be coming home today but we are still not sure. I guess I will keep you updated as things evolve.

      I AM SO VERY VERY TIRED!!!!  I didn't sleep last night because I was up working on the computer. I have joined the web site friendster and I was writing testimonials for all of my friends. Well now today they all said that they got e-mails saying that someone submitted a testimonial, but when they signed on there wasn't anything there. I am starting to hate that site. I was up all night and now I have nothing to show for it. Damn it!!  Nothing much has happened other than the fact that Me and Alek are doing great. I was a little concerned but I am pretty sure that things are good now. He got a tattoo today for his birthday. Happy Happy Joy Joy!!! I now have an inked out boyfriend. I am so excited to see it. I should be going over there in just a bit, but I want to finish writing this first.  Well lastly I want to keep you updated on my trip plans. We are going to have to change the date of our New Orleans trip to spring break. Granted that is far away but we will be there during Marti Gras and that will be so much fun!!! Also me and Nicole talked last night and I think our Europe trip plans are coming together. We should be going not this next summer but the summer after that. I think it will be my graduation present to myself. Lastly, Me and Nicole also talked about moving in together. We are going to look at some apartments down on second. OH BABY!!! Those apartments are so unique and great. I hope everything works out. We should be getting our plans together for that real soon. I will keep you updated as more info becomes available.

      Well yesterday I wrote about me and Alek's dream date the other night. I wrote about how it was everything that I could wish for. I wrote that it was like we were never apart. Well I guess if I felt like we weren't ever apart that night, I shouldn't expect that the following day to be any different from any other day. I mean that if I have never received a phone call, e-mail, IM, or any other form of romantic gesture the day after sex, I should not expect that now. Even though to me this particular evening was special compared to other nights when we were intimate, I shouldn't expect for it to be any more special to him. If I know how he is then I shouldn't expect for things to be any different this time.   Well the whole thing is that we still have a lot of things to work on and even though the other night we played pretend, the problems are still there. Maybe he didn't call or anything because he wanted the fantasy to last one more day. I mean hell I understand that as soon as we talk we are going to have to work through everything. We also need to decide what we want to do about the fact that he is leaving in a month. I wish this wasn't so hard. Love should be easy. Why on hell isn't it?

      Weirdest thing happened last night. Everything that I had wished for yesterday came true. I have missed Alek so very much in the past couple of weeks and finally last night we saw each other. It started out weird and then it was soon as if we were never apart. We went to Barnes for a little while and when we were walking into the building I saw a friend of mine from Lonestar. She asked if Alek was my boyfriend and quickly I replied, "this is Alek." That was strange considering that in that moment I wasn't sure what he was and things went back to being weird. All night that strange awkward feeling would come and go until later that night when we got back to his house. I knew then that it was right and meant to be. Hopefully this feeling won't come and go. I will keep you updated as thing progress.

      Well to start out with, I went out with Amber and Alisha last night and we went bar hoping. Okay I only stayed out with them till 11 but I had a lot of fun while I was there. (Alisha don't worry a couple more times out with me and Amber and you will play pool like a pro) So then I left there to go see Spiderman 2 for the midnight showing. I had a really good time and the movie was great BUT I have never been so glad that a movie was over in my life. The fricken A/C never came on and I felt like I had a fever. It was miserable. Anyway, other than that it was great. So I think that is enough talk about what I did last night.  Now onto the important stuff. I miss Alek a whole lot. I am not sure why exactly. I just want to see his hot sexy face and look into those gorgeous eyes. I want to see him looking back at me in appreciation while at the same time I am looking at him the same way. I want him to take me into his arms and kiss me like he has never kissed me before. Then I want to touch each other all over in order to explore each other's bodies, just to see if there is any secret places to be discovered. Then I want to make love as if it were the first time. HEHEHE I sound like a porn author. ughhh. Anyway, this is just a dream that will never come true. Even if it did real life never lives up to your expectations. Also if things went this far it would just be a cover up for the true problems we are having. BUT hell it would be a fun cover up while it lasted. WINK WINK!!!

      DO YOU LIKE MY NEW BACKGROUND?????  Well nothing too exciting going on right now. Last night I went to Amber's and as soon as I walked in the door she screamed we are going to Mexico! I am like uhhhh yeah. So she said that she was planning a trip to Mexico with Alisha and I had to come too. I was still like uhhhh yeah. Right whatever. So we sat down at the computer with Alisha on AIM and discussed everything while checking driving times and prices. I think we have now decided to go to New Orleans instead. I mean hell Mexico would be cool but come on it's LIKE New Orleans (Oh My God!). We should be going on Christmas break which gives us six months to plan. I am getting very excited about this and I think it's going to be great. Just too bad we didn't think of this six months ago because we could be there already. Anyway I will keep you posted as I know more.

      Have you ever had one of those days where you feel as though you are being pulled in every direction at once. All you want to do is get from point A to point B and there are all of these construction crews forces you to take detours. Well that is my life right now. It seems that all I want to do is get a few things done like cleaning my room, washing my car, reading a book, hanging out with friends, and going to work. But there is never enough time in a day and then my room never gets clean, my car is just gross (although the other day thanks to Ambers help I did get it cleaned out), I am in the middle of about 7 books that have no chance of getting finished, and I have so many friends that I can't find time for them all. I do go to work but that isn't really a want in life it's a "have too."Don't get me wrong I love my life and I do have time to do a lot of things. But it's just these small things that I want to do and I just can't find the time. UGHHHH!!!  Anyway, Last night I had a great time. I went out with a friend and we went to Barnes, then to dinner, and then to another friends house, then we watched Batman until about 4:30 in the morning. Great night!!! Unfortunately I didn't wake up till about 1:30 this afternoon. OOOOPS!!! But I never get to sleep in so it was really nice to do that too. But then again I woke up thinking of all the things I wanted to get done today and now don't have the chance because I stayed up way too late. Oh well there is always tomorrow.

      YAY!!!! Alek is home and I am sitting here with him as he unpacks. I am so happy to see him even though I am not showing it all that well. I have so much on my mind and I just got home from work. So when he got home, I wasn't expecting it. I am happy to see him but at the same time I had so many things that I wanted to do tonight. Nothing big and exciting but just stuff like cleaning my room and stuff like that. Anyway, I am here and hopefully we will have a good night before I have to go to work at lonestar tomorrow.   Well I am worried about bills. Everything will be fine as soon as I get my first full time paycheck. The problem is just making it till then. Everything should end up fine but you know me all I do is worry, worry, worry. Well I will keep you updated on that as things evolve.

      Well I am not really all that sure what I want to write about today. I guess I could tell you all about my day at work but that would really suck!!! My job is so fucking boring. I did go off on this guy I work with again today. That was fun!!!!He is such an idiot but because he knows a lot of big words and can articulate himself well, all the girls think he is soooo smart. Fortunately, for me I am smarter than many of the girls I work with and I can see right through his facade. Anyway, that is enough about work.  Tiffany is going to the hospital tomorrow and she may have to have surgery. I don't really want to talk about what she has to have surgery on but I can say that I am really worried about her. I am just tired of everyone in my family being sick. Luckily, dad is doing a lot better and he hasn't really had any more major problems. Hopefully, we will get him better yet.   Lastly, I miss Alek. He just left and he will be back Sunday but I still miss him. I know I shouldn't complain because I am going to have to get used to this. I just hope that we can work everything out before he leaves. I feel as if we just jumped back into our old habits and really didn't work on our problems. It's as if we are just ignoring things hoping that they will go away. I wish we could just talk about this openly and honestly. A friend of mine gave me advise last night saying that I need to just sit him down and not let him squirm his way out of answering my questions. I think that is good advise, I just hope I have the balls to make it happen. I guess we will see. I will keep you updated on everything.  P.S. Everyone say a prayer for Alisha's Aunt who has cancer. If we all pray for her and her family, hopefully things will get a lot better for her soon.

      Alek left for NIU today. Granted he will only be there till prolly Sunday, but it's the first step to him leaving for the next five years. I hope he has a good time while he is there and I hope he doesn't get too depressed over the idea of leaving everything that he knows. He was supposed to go up there this weekend with Courtney but she had to bale at the last minute. I wanted to go but unfortunately I have to work. SO he is up there all by himself. I just hope he comes home soon. Anyway, I have to stop it because I am going to have to learn to deal with it.  Before I go I need to tell you that I start full time on Monday. I am so excited about the idea of having more money. But I am not excited about being in that building 40hrs a week. Also I am not excited about working full time and going to school full time. URGHHHH Oh Well sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I will just work hard and prove to myself that I can do anything I set my mind too. Pray for me because I will be praying for myself every night.

      I promise yesterday I wrote a blog. I think there have been problems with electronics lately due to the storms. I wrote five testimonials the other day for friendster that never showed up and then yesterday I wrote a post on here that never showed up. I am not really sure what is going on. Oh Well!!!! I don't think I really said anything yesterday that was important, so you aren't missing out on anything.   So I have been ripping CD's into my computer lately. I am having a lot of fun doing it because now I can make mixed CD's for all of my friends. Also I have been borrowing CD's from friends so I can make mixed CD's for myself with any of the cost of going to walmart to buy a CD for just one song. COOL COOL COOL. I am loving it!!!   Also I have been hanging out with friends a lot lately. Any of my friends that are about to read this I don't want you to take offense to what I am about to say but.... I am really going crazy!!!!! God I am not one of these people who have to have my alone time but right now I haven't had anytime alone at all. I really need to find sometime to just sit in my room with a cosmo and music. I just need sometime by myself so I can relax and take care of myself for a minute. Right now as I speak I am sitting at Alisha's on her computer. All I want right now is to home in my room, doing nothing at all. I love my friends but I just need to be alone!!!!  Well I guess that's all for now. I am going to go into the living room and watch TV. Love always

But if that is what he wants to do that is AOK with me!!Well anyway I will get back with you later to let you know how it went.

      Well I just got home from the Fourth of July festivities. I had an okay night tonight. Let's see I had to work till six then I went to Aleks. From there we went to Ambers and we rented the movie called the perfect score. (at least I think that is the name of it) It was a pretty good movie. The Asian guy in it was fucking crazy funny!!!! Then I took Alek home because he has to be in bed early for work. I left there and went to JoJo's to meet up with some friends. The waitress sucked big time!!! I mean hell I know there was about ten of us but shit, it's not like we all ordered steaks. It took her about twenty minutes to bring the check. What the hell is that? We probably would have waited longer if Tom hadn't went up and asked for her to bring them. Anyway, I had a good time. That was my Fourth. Oh I did see some of the river fireworks. That was cool, even though I saw them from my car. Good Times!!! Well I hope everyone reading this had a good time too, even though you were too good to hang with me. BOO HOO, Cry Cry!!

         I had so much fun last night. I went to Alek's and we sat and talked all night long. It was so nice. We talked about everything that had been going on in our lives and for the first time in a long time I felt like I had my best friend back. I just love him so very much and I can't imagine not having him in my life.           &nbsp;     Tomorrow is my last day at Lonestar for the summer. I am so excited!!!! I hope I make a lot of money so I can start to save for moving out on my own. After I am finished with&nbsp;my night at Lonestar tomorrow I am going straight to Aleks. Then we are going to spend the night together and then we are going to spend all day Sunday together. I just can't wait. Well I will tell you more about all of that later.

      Okay well, I am as ready as I am going to get concerning the thoughts I talked about yesterday in this blog. I have done a lot of thinking about this and I now feel that I am ready to discuss the thoughts and feeling that I have been having. This concerns a certain person and I will keep the name of this person private in order to protect them. But I want to make it clear that this concerns all of my friends who read my blog and it is important for all of you to read this now because I am not going to type this again.  Well let me just start off by saying that what I write in here and on my webpages are "MY" thoughts. That is why I titled this blog "My Thoughts!!!!" This is just a place for me to write down what I am thinking and my feelings for the day. If for some reason you make it into my blog and you don't like what you have read then you need to understand that this is me RAW!!! I do not censor myself in here because I rarely censor myself in public. I speak what is on my mind as well as write it that way. I am trying to keep this blog as true to my personality as possible and that includes my sarcastic personality. In order for someone to be my friend they have to understand that side of me. I come across very brassy at times but it only comes from the fun, sarcastic side of myself. My friends can not be sensitive and at times they must have a thick skin to be around me. I expect for my friends to throw the comments back in the same fashion that I dish it. This is a very important trait for my friends to have. At one time I had a longtime friend who couldn't not handle this side of me and I found myself walking on eggshells just to be around her. I WILL NOT do that again!!! In the end we ended our close to 15 year relationship badly, which tells me that walking on eggshells never works in a true friendship. I will not and can not change this side of myself and if that hurts your feelings than maybe I am not the kind of friend that you need. I am not saying this to be mean or cruel. I am just saying this to be very honest. I love my friends very much and I would never do or say anything to intentionally hurt them or their feelings. BUT... The simple fact is that my sense of humor is sometimes a lot to swallow and it takes a strong person with a lot of self confidence to handle it. This is why I only surround myself with strong people who can take it as well as they dish it. Lastly, before I close this blog for the night I want to make it clear that this entry isn't intended for just one person, it is for everyone. In order to make people happy I have changed somethings in here as well as my webpage, but I will NOT ever be doing that again. JUST REMEMBER these are my thoughts and this is who I am. If you can't handle that then don't read my blog!!!   Also one more last thing, (and this IS for that one person who will remain nameless) before you fly off the handle over two little words please read the content around those words. My thoughts lie in the paragraph and not a word. I can sometimes be a little long winded but you will find that although I choose every words very carefully, it is the message that is important and not the words used. I have decided that this is the last time that I will discuss this issue with you because I feel that if it is a blog that is most important to you, then I will use this blog to communicate my feeling to you. Obviously when I say "I love you" in real life it doesn't matter as much as what is written online. Try to think about what I have written in here because these are the facts and they will not change in the future. I do love you very much but do not ask me to change who I am because I have never asked you to change things about yourself. If you can't handle me then maybe we weren't as close as I originally thought.

      There is something that I really want to talk to you about but I am afraid that I don't know if I am ready to write it on here yet. Basically, I will probably not be writing for the next couple of days in order to collect my thoughts and decide exactly how I want to word everything I am thinking. Then again I may decide to take the time tonight. Who knows? Anyway, as soon as I am ready I will get back with you.

      I have a lot to tell you today but it's just a lot of little things. Well to start off with I had a GREAT time last night with Alek. He was so wonderful. He was the way that I have always wanted him to be as well as a night that I have always wanted between the two of us. Also I started reading the book "The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty" by Anne Rice again. That may have had a little to do with our great night. For anyone who wants to read a really great series of books, I suggest these. They are very pornographic and S&M but I think you will like them. (even if Nicole does not) HEHEHE. Next, I spent the evening with Nicole tonight. We had a great time but I am afraid to say this (in case she reads this) but I was a little upset with her. Don't get me wrong because we had a great time. She just admitted to me that she wasn't too sure if she still wanted to try to move in together in a couple of months. I am happy that she told me this now before I got too excited, but at the same time I was a little disappointed. The fact is that I was already starting to get excited about it.  It's all good though because I still have a someone else who is thinking about moving in with me, so thing still may come through for me. Who knows. I don't want to say who this person is right now because I want to protect the innocent. (I am so secretive hehehe) Lastly, I am really upset about something between me, Amanda, and Amber. I don't want to talk too much about it because I haven't talked to Amber yet and I don't want her to read things on here before I get a chance to talk to her. I will keep you updated on that though as more happens.  Well I guess that's all for now. I will write back later.

         What do I want to talk about today??? I am just not sure. I have been working a lot lately, I have seen Alek a couple of times this week, and the rest of the time I sleep, eat, read, or watch TV. Nothing all that exciting has been happening. I am starting to get used to working full time and although I hate it, I think I am going to be okay. I just need to get very used to this because as soon as school starts I am not going to have any fun time at all. But that's cool because Alek will be at NIU so I need a lot to keep my mind off him being gone. Other than Alek leaving, another thing that I am not going to like when school starts is that I won't have any time for all of my friends. Actually me and Alisha will see each other more during school than we do now. This is a great thing, but I won't see Amanda near as much. I am doing my best to see her as much as possible in order to make up for the absence during school.      &nbsp;   I have had so much on my mind lately. A lot of it I don't really want to talk about on here because I don't want anyone to read about it. I do know that if there is anyone out there that is reading this and would like to talk to me I would really appreciate it if you would e-mail me and let me know. I have a lot of friends but that doesn't mean that I can afford to lose any of them. Well I guess that is all that I want to say about that. I love you all and I couldn't live without any of you.

         Damn I have had a horrible night. A girl from work has been bugging me for months to hang out with her. Finally, tonight I gave in and went out with her after work. BIG MISTAKE!!!! First of all she lives in Henderson. That wouldn't be a big deal if I hadn't worked all day and if I weren't very tired. So anyway, we went to this kariokie bar that was so redneck and sucked really bad. Plus she was on the phone all night and wandering around the bar talking to everyone but me. I just wasn't having a good time at all. Then when I finally got someone to take her home so I could go I got stuck in this road construction that took me about thirty minutes out of my way. I was running low on gas and almost out of smokes. (Mandy and her brother didn't bring any squares to the bar and bummed off me all night) Anyway, I stopped at a gas station and only had enough money for gas. So now tomorrow I am going to be an even bigger bitch because I will be at work all day without anything and be running on very little sleep. Well I guess I need to get offline and go to bed. I just can't wait to start my day tomorrow. WOOHOO!!!

         What a weekend I have had. I can't even begin to tell you how much fun me and Alek had just being together. I won't go into all of the juicy details with you but I can say that we just had a blast!!! Other than just spending time with Alek I also saw Nicole today. We went out to lunch, then to Value City and then to the Book and Music Exchange. We had so much fun and did&nbsp;a lot of catching up. Granted we see each other once a week but in that week so much always happens. Anyway, that's not the point of the story. The point is that I am looking to move out come December. I have someone in mind for a roommate who will be wanting to move out about the same time I do, but for right now I am not going to name names in order to not jinks things. So I have to start thinking about saving and figuring out a plan of action. I have been making the first steps in the last couple of days. I have talked things over with my mom and we have figured out a way to save 2000 dollars in the next five months. That will help out a lot when it comes to getting everything ready. I have priced furniture and I have figured out about what I will be able to afford. Plus I have been checking prices on apartments and utilities. I am hoping that with a little planning I can make this really happen. Now I just have to make sure my roommate comes through and everything should be fine. I just can't wait. I wish this five months would just fly by and the semester would be over. Funny that I want the semester to be over before it has even started. HEHEHE Anyway, I guess that's all for now. I will get back with you as soon as I know more.

         Let me think....What do I want to talk about today???? I am just not sure. Nothing really has happened. I went to work today and I came home. YAY!!! So much fun. I have been trying to clean my room for the past week and I have decided to not go to bed till it's done. HA yeah right. I am now here online instead of cleaning. Anyway, I will get this done!!!! Well I better go and get to work.

         This is so hard for me to talk about. I know that I talk about it all the time and all of my friends know that I have problems dealing with my body image. But for some reason writing&nbsp;this down&nbsp;is a lot harder than talking about this with friends. Well basically, I have been feeling dissatisfied with my body for some time now. (DUH Everyone knows this) I have done so many different things trying to lose weight. For the most part I do very well for several months and then for some reason or another I stop, gain everything back, plus some, and then start my vicious cycle all over. I am so very tired of doing this. I would like to get into a lifestyle change weight loss&nbsp;program but I am just not sure that I am motivated enough to do anything about it. I am just SOOOO very lazy. Alisha has been doing a great job of keeping me motivated as well as giving me some great ideas for making this happen. I am just a person&nbsp;who needs instant gratification and I know that I just can't be like this anymore if I want to make this lifestyle change. Today with Alisha's help I narrowed down some of my key problems. Mainly, I work a sit down job where I eat all day and move nothing but my fingers. Because I am at work I don't have a lot of options for nutritional food and choose to eat whatever is in the vending machines... ie candy and chips. Alisha has given me some alternatives to these snacks and hopefully with a little planning I can eat a little more healthy at work. My nest problem is fast food. I am a person who is always on the go. I am never home and rarely do any of my eating in my house. Because of this I eat a lot from fast food places. I have decided to just choose options from these places that are more healthy. Most fast food places have figured out that health food is not just a fad and are now incorporating these things into their menus. Lastly, there is exercise. Today I cancelled my YMCA membership because I just never go anymore. I can't afford to throw my money away in hopes that I will go to the gym and start my new life. Plus when school starts there is just no way that I will find time to go. So I have decided that I am going to do my best to do some form of activity every day. I am not sure what this is going to be but I figure that when school starts I am going to do a lot of walking around campus. Maybe I will even dust off some of my workout tapes and do that again. Anyway, I am going to do my best.           &nbsp;     So here is the thing that has been upsetting me the most about this body image thing. As we all know Alek has been losing a lot of weight. Yesterday we went to buy him new jeans and he was fitting into the size 32 jeans. I was like Oh My God!!!! I just couldn't believe it. I mean I knew that he was thin but GOD DAMN!!!! So I just got very depressed. By the time we got home I was hating those damn jeans. Don't get me wrong he looked very hot but I just couldn't help but think that he is just going to get tired of his fat girlfriend and leave me. He tells me all the time that he thinks I am sexy but I just can't believe him. How can anyone think this body is sexy??? So I know this is just my little demon telling me this but I can't help but listen. So anyway I am going to do my best to change the way I look so that I don't have to listen to that little demon anymore. I am not doing this to keep Alek because I know that he will love me no matter what but at the same time I just can't get upset anymore without being prepared to do something about it. I am not going to get sucked into fad diets and I am not going to try to crash myself into getting thin fast. I am just going to try to do my best and make some small changes that I can live with for the rest of my life. Hopefully this way I don't fall into the same old patterns.

          I am going to try to keep this short today. I am sitting here at Alek's and we are having a great time. Right now he is in the kitchen making popcorn so that is why I am taking this time now to write. Last night we watched the movie Secret Window and today we watched The Last Samurai. Both great flicks and I would recommend them both to anyone. The Secret Window wasn't one of Johnny Depp's best movies but it was good and the Last Samurai was long so plan to make several potty breaks.  Other than that I really liked them both. (Alek just came back in and he has a twislers in his mouth trying to do the Lady and the Tramp  spagetti scene.) He is so funny! Anyway we are going to watch Sports Night now so I will write more later. I have something I really want to talk to you about but for right now I need to  give my attention to Alek. LOVES TO EVERYONE!!!

       Sorry I haven't written in a while but trust me there really hasn't been anything to talk about. I have done nothing for the past five days but work visit with Alek and sleep. We haven't even really had a chance to have any fun when we hang out because I have had to be in bed so early. "Life sucks donkey balls and then you die." Anyway, Alek is leaving on Tuesday and hopefully if all goes well I will be able to go with him to help move him in. Until then I plan to spend every waking moment with him. I am just getting so upset with the idea of him leaving. I am trying to keep a happy face because I know he is nervous and I don't want to him to be anymore upset about the move. I am sure everything will be cool. Hell Dad went to Germany for a while when he was in the army and Mom did okay. AND THE ARE STILL TOGETHER. I think we will be okay. I just wish I could go with him. Unfortunetly, I am just not ready yet. I like my life here and I am just not ready to leave USI. It would be nice to move out on my own but I think I am going to have to do that here. Granted if I can move out here I should be able to move out to anywhere in the country, but out of state tuition it just too much. I might as well just go to UofE. (Which I have decided isn't as good of a school as USI because it's more expensive and the education you get there isn't any better) You ask how do I know this? Well I have been talking to people around town and everyone that I have talked to that goes there isn't very happy with the school. Okay time to stop rambling and time to get back to the subject of this blog. Well anyway I am just scared about this year. It is going to be so hard to get through it without Alek being here for support. I know that he will be just a phone call away but I just don't want us to get into any relationship problems because of this. I love him so much and I know that he is the man that I want to marry. We just have to work through this and become stronger because of it. I just hope it all works out.

         Today was the fifth day of my ten day stretch at work. Half way through, YAY!!!! Okay so, Alek leaves in a week and I am just trying not to think about it. I just don't know what I am going to do without him. He really is my rock and support. He is always there for me and I want to be there for him if anything happens where he needs me. I am trying to figure out a way to move up there as soon as possible to be with him. I just need to get my car paid off and as soon as that happens I will be on my way. I have always been planning to go to grad school there but now I just think I may want to finish undergrad there instead. Not that I really want to leave USI, because I really love it at that school. but I just have to be with Alek. OKAY, I need to stop crying over him leaving and talk about something else.  This weekend was great. I did have to work but other than that, I was with Alek hanging out. He got his second tattoo. It's a treble clef. VERY COOL!!! He is so very very HOT!!!! So after he got his tat we colored my hair and watched a movie. First, let me talk about my hair. It is very dark and a little bit red. So Cool!! It is different from what I am used to but Alek loves it and it is starting to grow on me too. Next, we watched the movie "The Ninth Gate." HATED IT!!! The script sucked, directing sucked, and the only thing that was good about it was the fact that I could look at Johnny Depp. I should have bought "The Pirates of the Caribbean" instead but this movie came in a set with "Stir of Echoes" so it was a better deal. Next time I will get "The Pirates of the Caribbean." Well I guess that's all for now. I will tell you more later.
