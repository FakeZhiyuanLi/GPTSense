      Mitch Kupchak.It's obvious that he is in over his head at this point in time. Dr Buss,feel free to call Jerry West up and apoligize to him for running him out of town to Memphis. We need a real GM right now who has the experience. Every passing day brings more and more bad news. D Fish has opted out of his deal now. Let's see, I guess that leaves "the glove" Gary Payton and Deaven George on the team now(even though Shaq is under contract,I'm not counting on him being around anymore because it's obvious he doesn't want to be Laker anymore). Great, that's just a fine nucleus of players,NOT.

      This makes all the sense in the world for the Clintons. urlLink Drudge  is quoting an unnamed top Kerry source saying that "all the signs are pointing in that direction". This is a scary development, but one that if true in my opinion will only help solidify support for Bush. Sure Hillary will energize the female vote, etc, but she will energize the GOP base like nothing else could.This is a fascinating development in the campaign.

      As i was going through the news today,I am always struck when I hear democrats,specifically Hillary at a San Francisco fundraiser for Barbara Boxer,say that we need to recind the recent tax cuts for the "common good". Huh???? Excuse me  urlLink Hillary , but the money I earn is my money and not the federal governments money. We are not under taxed in the US. What an amazing story.                      Also we handed sovereignty back to the Iraqis yesterday. That was a great symbolic day for them if nothing else. We all know that security is still going to be a problem for them over there,but it was nice to see that we are keeping our word to them that we are not occupiers,but liberators. Their destiny is in their hands now.                     I have mixed emotions about the Supreme Court's ruling that enemy combatants can now have access to the US Judical system. On one hand everyone deserves to get their due process and day in court if accused of a crime, but the people we have down at GITMO are not US citizens. They are enemy combatants. Are our soldiers now supposed to start reading the Miranda warning to all prisoners of war that we capture? Hard questions. I think the court has just muddied the waters

        Oh my how the double standard/hypocracy wheel turns.Get ready everyone for fireworks this week in the John Kerry Campaign. It seems that what's good for the goose is good for the gander.  urlLink Drudge  is reporting that the same media that demanded sealed divorce records from now former Republican Senate candidate Jack Ryan of Illinois,are set to demand full release of John Kerry's very messy 1988 divorce. For those that aren't familiar with the Jack Ryan details,his divorce records say that his wife alledged that he wanted some form of sex in public at certain strip clubs(Bill Clinton eat your heart out!). Your about to see a media feeding frenzy that doesn't happen all that often,but when it does it is a sight to behold. The only question I have is if the media will have the guts to actually follow through with this.What a great start to the week!

      Well,I'm back from an awesome three day weekend in Lake Tahoe.Everything was perfect,except I lost about $100 playing blackjack. I want to give props to the Nelson,Barnett,and Hagemeyer families for putting on a wonderful event.The scenery was beautiful,friends & family great and much more. It looks like we will do this all again in three months when Katie & Jonas say their "I do's" in Napa. I'm looking forward to that one too. For anyone reading this wanting a great wedding reception place,you couldn't do much better than Edgewood Country Club in Tahoe.What a place. I'm out

        I have a question for all you liberals out there.I'm putting a fund together to help  urlLink Al Gore's  family pay for the insane asylum.How much can you guys pitch in? It's obvious he has lost all touch with reality.They might even just send him to some sort of anger management program to deal with his issues.Between his and Howard Dean's speeches,it's a wonder Kerry is even close right now.John "f..ing" Kerry has got to be cursing at himself right now and trying to figure out how to muzzle these idiots.I say,keep it up Al and Howard.The more America sees these speeches,the faster you'll slip into political oblivion.

      As i'm sitting here at my desk thinking of how we all can best honor Ronald Reagan,I got it.What if everyone took one Saturday a month out their busy schedule and volunteered for the local/county Bush Cheney 2004 team from now until election time to help Bush across the finish line a winner.It is going to take a huge effort to turn out our voters.The RNC has put together what they call the "72 hour task force" to mobilize voters during the last weekend before the Tuesday election.We plan to put together the biggest get out the vote drive that has ever been undertaken by a campaign.Everyone knows that the stakes couldn't be higher in November.Everything from security,taxes,judgeships,etc is on the table.A few votes in a few swing states is going to make all the difference.An added benefit is that working for the campaign is fun.You get to meet all kinds of new people and make new friends with people of like mind.

      Bad news for democrats, urlLink new U.S. home sales leap to record high . John Kerry et al can't be very happy about all these positive economic indicators lately.I mean according to him we're in the worst economy since the Great Depression.All this good news is just not good for them.They were hoping to campaign on gloom and doom as always.

      As the election gets closer and closer,I am becoming even more optimistic about our chances to pick up some badly needed Senate seats so President Bush can get his judges confirmed.I figure there will be at least two Supreme Court vacancies during the next Presidential term if not three.It is very important to have a Republican Senate to break the democratic filibusters that they have been using. urlLink John Thune  is a great candidate.He barely lost to Tim Johnson in an off year election in 2002.Tom Dascle has seen his best days already.It's time to send him back to home to his real home in Washington D.C,not in South Dakota where he pretends to be conservative the closer the election gets.Any donations for him would be greatly appreciated.

      Yesterday at the polls.This is exactly what the  urlLink Club for Growth  was formed to do.It bundles financial support to pro growth,free market conservatives over RINO candidates.In the case of David Beasley of South Carolina though,it was because of his protectionist views.In the Utah 2nd district race,John Swallow won the right for a rematch against Jim Matheson.John lost a squeaker in 2002 and seems in good position to win this seat back.He should get good coattails from Bush's upcoming winning margin in Utah.

      Well I guess it's time to go on record about my illustrious   urlLink UCLA Bruins  for the upcoming season.After all,I did name my blog after them.I'm afraid this is the season we are going to hit rock bottom.I really would like to believe that the glass is half full,but after reviewing this years recruiting class,player losses,coaching quotient,and a few other factors,one can only come to the conclusion that this season is going to be an absolute train wreck.They probably will be unwatchable.If the gutty little bruins can scrape a victory over USC then I would classify that as a good season for them this year.I'm not getting my hopes up though.

      Being the commodities/futures broker that I am,I believe that psychology is what drives the markets.When people feel strongly about a market,they wager money or trade on that information.There are now exchanges to take action on political races.One such place is called  urlLink Intrade . Right now based on current betting and trades, urlLink George W Bush  has a 58% of pulling out a victory in November.This of course can change,but right now the so called "smart money" is on Bush.

      This past weekends' games of the Dodgers playing the Yankees brought back alot of memories for me.First let me say that I used to be a Dodger fan through and through.I have not followed them too closely lately because quite frankly they suck! The last straw for me was when they traded Mike Piazza and then proceeded to sell the team to Fox.Now a guy from Boston named Frank McCourt owns the team? What's wrong with that picture? Anyway I remember vividly the two back to back world series that the Dodgers and Yankees played back in the late seventies'.I remember Mr. October Reggie Jackson hitting three bombs in one game to win the series and rip our hearts out.I remember "the rundown" where Steve Garvey threw the ball back to the second baseman and Reggie stuck his wide body in front of the ball and the ball then hitting him.Tommy Lasorda ran out to argue,but it was all for not.My,my how baseball has changed from those days.Anyone remember these guys?   And who could forget this moment in time

      I wanted to share with everyone here on the blog of my experience at the     urlLink Reagan Library .Ronald Reagan was my hero.He championed freedom and liberty more than any modern politician IMO.I left my house at 7:45pm .The drive to the library is about 100 miles from my house.My wife and I arrived at the staging area of Moorpark College at 12:30am this morning after waiting three and half hours just to get off the freeway.We got in the line for the shuttle at 1am this morning.At 6am we finally boarded the bus to the library.The five hour wait in line seemed to go by very fast as we made many new friends while waiting.At 6:20am we arrived in the rotunda where the President's body lay in repose.It really was a surreal moment and it was all I could do to hold back tears.The viewing lasted no more than two minutes.I will never forget this day as long as I live.Rest in peace Mr President.

I will not waste a dime on it.I would like to hear some feedback from anyone that does read it though.Maybe I'll read through some of it on my next trip through the bookstore for free.

      It looks like a classic buy the rumor, sell the fact day as we say in stockbroker lingo. The trading today over at  urlLink Intrade's Presidential Futures   is up for Bush. With markets, everything is factored into the equation. It seems that people are realizing that now that the DNC convention is over, Bush is looking better and better. This week was a high water mark for Kerry. It's all downhill from here I'm glad to say for John Kerry. He may even get a small bounce from the convention, but it still doesn't change the fact that people who are wagering real money are still betting on Bush.

      With all the hubbub about the DNC convention this week, I forgot to mention that Dr. Tom Coburn won a huge primary victory in Oklahoma this week. Tom Coburn is a strong conservative and was backed by the Club For Growth. It's another sign that the Club is fast becoming a kingmaker and RINO killer. Tom's main opponent was Tulsa mayor Kirk Humphreys. Humphreys was the choice of the RNC, the so-called safe pick, but Oklahoma can do better and they did. It's another reason that the RNC should not pick favorites in the primary like they tend to do. Let the voters decide. Tom will face off against his successor in the house when he retired, Brad Carson. Oklahoma is a very Republican state and Tom should do well in November with Bush at the top of the ticket. Rep. Carson did not even go to his own party's convention because he is afraid of being seen with all the freaks there this week. Actually probably a smart move for him.

      I am the only one that noticed that Kerry was sweating like a pig up there on stage? I thought it was hilarious. They needed to crank up the AC in the arena. I also heard the stage manager curse at the guys in the rafters while watching CNN. He was heard saying "what the fuck are you guys doing up there,drop all the balloons and confetti now!" As for the speech itself, it was Kerry trying to pretend that he was a Republican. He hammered away that he would be a better command-in-chief than Bush. He didn't really talk about his record in the Senate for the last twenty years, but that's okay because I'm sure Karl Rove et al will make sure that Kerry's voting record gets exposed for what it is and that is extremely liberal. I can't wait for the RNC now. Oh yeah I almost forgot, Kerry says he was born in the "west wing" of the hospital in Colorado. I beg to differ. He was born in the left wing of the hospital :^)

      I happen to like seeing "red meat" at political conventions. Today's conventions are too scripted. The campaigns from both sides are trying to put a "moderate face" on their candidates. This is IMO a disservice to the voters. Having said all this, the Kerry campaign is probably not to happy about Reverand Al's speech last night. He didn't follow the script very well or at all. I watched the speech on CNN. After he was done you could almost see Judy Woodruff blowing a gasket. She looked pissed off. After all, she and most others in the media are liberal, and she knows as well as anyone that Al's speech did not play well in Peoria as they say. In fact, I think it turned off many swing voters. They then went to Candy Crowley behind the podium to interview the Reverend after the speech. Her first question: "Was that speech approved by the Kerry campaign?", Al's answer: "I got approval for the tone of the speech from them(I highly doubt that)", Candy then followed up with this question: "were your actual words approved Reverend Sharpton?" Al's answer: "I told them that I needed to answer Bush's speech from last Friday's Urban League meeting". I then switched channels to Chris Matthews. He was livid also! How dare this man come out and give a red meat speech like he did! The only saving grace for Kerry is that most people probably did not and will not see or hear about Al's speech.

       urlLink I don't know how these stories would get told if there wasn't a Matt Drudge of the world . In another huge scoop, Drudge is reporting that the war footage that John Kerry's campaign plans to use to introduce John Kerry was all reenactments. This guy Kerry is turning out to be pathological. Most guys in the military will tell you that they never try to call attention to their service. It just isn't done. In fact most guys, if asked about their combat experience, are extremely reluctant to say anything about it. A few guys have told their stories to be sure, but to glorify it like Kerry is doing is disengenuous at its best and pathological at its worst. The story says that after a couple of firefights, Kerry went into town to purchase a super 8 video camera and then went back to the scenes of the battles and had other people film him walking resolutely through the jungle and reenacting certain things for the camera. I'm wondering if this sort of activity is encouraged by the military. I'm guessing it is not, but i'm going to check it out. Maybe in addition to those purple hearts we could add some sort of military censure or court martial. This should be interresting.

       ************************* Memo to Kerry campaign ***********************  RE: Selling John F...ing Kerry  It's not going to work running as a moderate. I'm officially naming this gathering "The Reinvention Convention". You might as well take your chances and run as a true blue liberal. Why don't you want to run as one? You clearly are the most liberal Senator in the Senate. We all know it kills you to moderate your message. Just drop all pretense and run far to the left. You'll feel liberated after doing so. Also just another piece of advice: you might want to have a talk with that trophy wife of yours. I know she is now a billionaire, but she is not keeping her end of the bargain up. Put a muzzle on her. The contrast between Laura Bush and Thereza is striking. You won't win the Presidency because of your wife, but you could lose it if she keeps running her mouth.

      Wow, where should I begin. My opinion of the first night of the DNC is that it was the same old,same old. First Al Gore came out and appeared heavily sedated. Gone was the animated/Move-On.org  Al Gore of the last few years. I think he had to promise Kerry's staff that he would take his prozac before the speech and it showed.  * Next we had Jimmy Carter. You know it's bad for the Democrats when Jimmy Carter has to give the "red meat" speech of the convention. I don't know what's funnier, Jimmy Carter lecturing Bush about the evils of North Korea or him saying that we had lost credibility with the rest of the world community(translation of world community= France & Germany).  * On to Mrs. Monotone errr I mean Hillary Clinton. This women needs a speech coach in the worst way. She has no inflexion in her voice. It is just one long annoying monotone. She has four years to work on all these things because she is going to be the nominee in 2008 when kerry loses this year. * Lastly we had Bubba. He is the Democrats rock star of the convention. That man can deliver a speech. You may not agree with it, but he gives a great speech without sounding like a liberal. You can tell he loves being on the stage. He didn't want to leave it last night.

         urlLink Ahh who could forget this moment . It brings back so many good memories. 1988 was the first year that I got to cast my ballot and I proudly voted for George HW Bush. This picture must be bittersweet for all my Democrat friends out there. You have to admit it though,liberals, the picture brings to mind the phrase "fish out of water". Maybe they could put John Kerry in a picture with him working a normal job. I mean, he's never had to work a regular job or meet a payroll deadline as an employer in his life except for the few years that he was a soldier,which by the way I give him credit for. God knows he looks like a fish out of water when he is around normal people.

      I hope this is just a rumor. Drudge had something today on his website saying that USA Today had hired Michael Moore to be a columnist from the convention. They also hired Ann Coulter to write columns from the DNC convention. I don't think having Michael Moore at the RNC gathering is such a very good idea. First, us Republicans need to eat and by having Moore there, he might eat all the food and not leave any for others. Second, if i were him, I really wouldn't be showing my face at that convention. I mean, doesn't he have another conspiracy movie to film? I can't wait to hear more about this from USA Today.

      That's the time time left until the Presidential election. On tap this week is the Democratic National Convention. Boy I'm I excited about watching it(NOT). It appears set to become a bash Bush convention. I hope it is, so the few people that will actually watch it see how desperate the Democrats are these days. I'm convinced that there is not a majority out in America of hate Bush people. They will be just preaching to the choir. If it becomes a Michael Moore type of convention, you can kiss the Presidency goodbye for another four years dems.

       urlLink It looks like Kobe Bryant will be around for the Lakers afterall   this upcoming season. In what has to seen as a devastating blow to the prosecution, the judge in the case, Terry Ruckriegle has just ruled today that the accuser's sex life in the 72 hour period prior to and after the alledged rape can be used against her as exculpatory evidence. This oughta just about wrap up this case. I don't think any reasonable jury is going to convict someone for rape if it can be shown that the accuser was basically slutting around prior to and after the alledged incident. This begs the question of why this case was even filed in the first place. I wouldn't be surprised if the plug is pulled on this case and Kobe settles the soon to be civil suit for a few million dollars. Case closed. Kobe'a a few million dollars poorer, but he just signed a $140 million contract with the Lakers, so he is not hurting and he has his freedom back

      I won't go over all of them, but suffice to say, the Edwards VP selection bounce has all but disappeared according to  urlLink Real Clear Politics  cumulative poll average. This is not good news for the Kerry campaign. They should be up by at least six or seven points right now. They probably will get their other bounce when their convention is over next week. To add insult to injury, Bush is still winning in the futures market too,albeit by a very slim margin. You also had Alan Greenspan telling Congress this week that the recovery is not weak and it is in fact very robust, so much so that he warned that the Fed would aggressively raise rates to combat inflation should it occur. In the end, the economy will once again be the deciding factor in the race assuming that a catastophic event doesn't take place between now and the election.

         urlLink This week does mark the 35th anniversary  of Ted Kennedy's murder errr I mean accidental death(alledgedly) of Mary Jo Kopechne at the Chappaquiddick bridge. After a night of debauchery, Ted was driving down the road and drove his car off a bridge. He escaped with his life, but his passenger Mary Jo was not as lucky. She ended up drowning and Ted didn't report the incident to the authorities until the next morning. No one is really shocked that he beat the rap. After all, he is a Kennedy. I'm sure papa Joe made a few calls and made the whole thing go away. It's also ironic that on the 35th anniversary of the incident that the DNC is in Boston next week. Coincidence?

        Today was a momentous day in the financial markets. I've been a broker for almost eight years now and I have never seen Mr Greenspan come right out and telegraph a rise in interest rates like he did today. In my opinion, everyone needs to get ready for this eventuality. The people with adjustable rate mortgages should be ready to at the very least hedge their exposure to a rise in interest rates. This can be easily done by selling short Eurodollar,treasury bonds & note futures. Needless to say there can be alot of money made by speculating in this market right now too. If anyone is interrested in how this might work, please give me a call at the office. The firm i'm at is called  urlLink Excel Futures . The phone number is (888)959-9955

        The Academy award winning flopper/whiner Vlade Divac has apparently agreed to terms with the Lakers after playing for the Suckramento Queens the last six years according to a source at ESPN. Did the Lakers really have a choice? I mean, they don't have a bona fide center right now after trading Shaq away. Welcome back to the fold Vlade, I think. Now that your a Laker again and in light of your diminishing skills/advancing age, may I suggest you ready yourself this season for the acting performance of your lifetime. We'll need it.

      In a further sign that Democrats have no sense of humor, They have berated Arnold for calling them "girlie men". Never has so much been said about so little. He was just poking fun at himself and the process in my opinion. The hyper-sensitive gay/bi-sexual/transgender lobby needs to chill out.  urlLink What Arnold was saying   was that the Democrats were so beholden to groups like trial lawyers and unions that they have no guts to make decisions on what's best for the state. I say, you go Arnold! That's what we elected him to do. We needed him to shake up the business as usual democratic legislature. I think he should keep holding out until he gets the spending cuts and laws repealed that he wants.

      She was sentenced today to five months in the slammer, five months of home confinment, and two years probation. My thoughts: She lied to federal prosecutors. When you lie to the feds and get caught, there are consequences. She should have known better than to dump her stock in Imclone after getting tipped about the FDA approval(or lack thereof) for their drug they were developing. She used to be a stockbroker herself, so to claim there was some sort of stop loss sell order when there wasn't one was bogus. I'm a stockbroker/commodity broker myself. Believe me, every non-discretionary order from a client has to be written on a ticket and saved for future audits by the NASD and NFA. Most brokers also tape record the order with the client so there is no confusion. She and her broker didn't have anything to back up their claim that there was a good until canceled(GTC) sell stop for her account. It's only cheating if you get caught and Martha you got caught. Just shut up and pay your dues. I'm sure you will be showing all the other inmates how much potential there is to each and every cell to decorate.

        After  urlLink Sen. John McCain introduced VP Dick Cheney   at a rally in Michigan, the washington press corp have officially gone into meltdown mode. First off, politics is a contact sport. Lots of past Presidents have switched VPs midstream for various reasons.

I'm not saying that Bush is going to replace Cheney with McCain, but I wouldn't be shocked if it actually happened. I'm sure they have lots of polling data to back up any decision they make. Bush is a very loyal man, but if he thinks he needs a change of scenery at the Veep spot then i'm sure He wouldn't hesitate to pull the trigger. In fact Karl Rove is out here in Irvine,CA today for a big GOP meeting and i'm sure it is being secretly discussed right now.    urlLink

        Today at high noon is the time that Kobe will announce what team he has chosen. It will be either the Clippers or the Lakers. I still gotta believe that with all the moves that the Lakers have been making, firing Phillip and trading Shaq, that this was done to accomadate Kobe Bryant's wishes. There is a part of me still though that is worried that Kobe might just want a change of scenery and go with the Clippers. I guess anything is possible today after what happened to Carlos Boozer and that entire messed up situation. Stayed tuned everyone....  ************************* UPDATE ***********************************  After toying with the LA Clippers and then ripping their hearts out, Kobe has decided to re-sign with the Lakers. Come on, was there any doubt? It just makes total sense. Basically the Lakers gave in to every one of Kobe's wishes. I don't buy the argument that they got rid of Phillip and Shaq because it was the right thing to do. Kobe and Dr. Buss had a secret agreement I believe, but Mitch had to say that Kobe wasn't calling the shots, but we know otherwise.

      This was a difficult decision by the Lakers to part company with arguably the greatest center ever, but it was a move they had to make. Shaq's skills are diminishing and by trading him while he still was under contract, the Lakers received some good players in return. Having said that, Shaq is still far and away the best center in the NBA by a long way. He instantly turns the Heat into contenders for next year in the East. That big sigh you hear is the western conference teams breathing easier now that they only have to face him twice a year and not four or five times. Minnesota and San Antonio start off prohibitive favorites in the west. I can't wait to see the look on Shaq's new teammates faces when he shows up to training camp overweight and out of shape. As for the Lakers, obviously this is a huge gamble. For all we know Kobe is going to be playing in the Colorado penal league next year or worse, with the LA Clippers. If either of those scenarios come to fruition, the Lakers are, pardon my expression F*$#KED. My educated guess though is that he re-signs with the Lakers and he beats the rap in Colorado. They(Lakers) are now also left without a center.Great. They are going to have to run the court like no other, which is fine for Kobe. That's what he has wanted to do ever since he came into the league. In my opinion it is going to take them a couple of years to put all the pieces into place, but once they do, they could model themselves like the Michael Jordon Bulls of the 90's.

        Mike Ditka is starting to seriously consider running for US Senate from Illinois. At first everyone thought it was just a goof, but as Illinois Republicans contemplate their current standing and lack of talent to draw from, Da Coach is looking more and more appealing to the rank & file. Obviously he has to be further vetted. Sen. George Allen of Virginia,Chairman of the NRSC, is meeting with Iron Mike today to have a heart to heart about what being a US Senator is like and what Mike can expect. All systems are go right now. This is the Democrats worst nightmare come true. They were already popping champagne corks celebrating Obama's victory, but as they say in sports, you still have to play the actual game. In fact, an online unscientific poll by the Chicago Tribune today has Ditka leading by roughly 54-46%!

      The Senate is scheduled to vote on a procedural move to get to the gay marriage amendment vote. This issue is very cut and dried for me. Marriage should remain between a man and a woman. We don't however in my opinion need a constitutional amendment yet. The issue should be left to the states. I can understand the desire to try for the amendment right now with a couple of recent court decisions i.e Massachusetts,Vermont, and Hawaii, but Bill Clinton signed DOMA (Defense of marriage Act) in 1996 and that is the law of the land right now. DOMA basically reinforced the "full faith & credit clause" in the constitution saying that states are allowed to not recognize gay marriage if they wish. This way, some states that want it can have it and others that don't want it, don't have to recognize it. If however this issue gets to the Supreme Court and they rule that states must recognize gay marriage, it would then be appropriate to get relief via the amendment process.

      Right now at this moment in time, Bush is ahead at  urlLink Intrade Presidential Futures . Of course this is just a snapshot of today's moment in time, but it is interresting to see that after all the kerry/Edwards talk in the last week that Bush is still ahead at Intrade in all the states that he won back in 2000. If he does manage to carry all the states that he did in 2000, he would have 278 electoral votes and he would be the winner again. This makes me very happy. The polls put out by the various media are all well and good, but nothing is more accurate than the futures markets of predicting future events. The smart money is still on Bush. The open intrest is over 385,000 contracts right now, also a very good indicator and a very liquid market.

      I was reading the register this morning and look who's coming to Newport Beach this Saturday. None other than VP contender/pretender John Edwards. Here is the story from the OC Register(posted here because registration required):  Edwards has O.C. lunch date  Orange County's been on a roll when it comes to visits from the highest-profile Democrats – and the trend will continue, with John Kerry's chosen running mate John Edwards stopping in for lunch at the Balboa Bay Club in Newport Beach on Saturday.   Frank Barbaro, chairman of the county Democratic Party and head of the county Kerry- Edwards campaign, said this will be the last California stop by a member of the presidential ticket before the Democratic National Convention in Boston, which begins July 26.  The campaign "thinks it's appropriate to have the California sendoff in the Republicans' back yard, here in Orange County," Barbaro said.  The event is expected to sell all 450 available seats, with a minimum $1,000 per-plate donation. Barbaro said he expects to raise at least $500,000, and several commitments have been made for the maximum donation of $27,000 – including himself, county Democratic Foundation founder Wylie Aitken, former Irvine Co. board member Joan Irvine Smith, and county Democrat icon Dick O'Neill.

Well some surfer named Brad Smith of Southern Australia was ambushed by two great white sharks over the weekend and killed. This is not good for my phyche when I go back into the water at the beach. I'm always thinking about this possibility in the back of my head when i'm out there body surfing or swimming. This poor guy never had a chance. Usually they'll bite you and release you because they mistake us humans for they favorite food, seals.

      It looks from the sound of everything that Shaquille O'Neal is set to go the Miami Heat and Pat Riley's dictatorship. Good luck to all involved there. Riley is known as a strong diciplinarian and Shaq could give a crap about coming to camp in shape or improving his horrendous free throw stroke. Now that the deal for all intents and purposes is done, I have some thoughts. Initially I didn't want him to be traded, but the more I thought about it, the more it made sense for the Lakers. He is on the downslope of his career. We might as well get something for him while we still can. If he stayed, he would have been a cancer in the locker room because of his lame-duck status. He obviously feels the Lakers disrespected him after the season. Get over it Shaq. Look what happened last year when he waited almost until the season had begun before he had his foot surgery when he could have taken care of it after the last season had ended. His coming to training camp perpetually overweight and out of shape just showed a complete disregard for his other teammates and they always resented him for that. Let's be honest here also,this is now Kobe's team. He doesn't like that fact at all. Kobe Bryant is not going to the LA Clippers. He may be stupid, but he's not that stupid. They never got along with each other on or off the court and that is an important consideration. I expect Kobe to re-sign this week with the Lakers.

      The traffic going to and from San Diego is just getting so ridiculous. We left the OC today at 1:30pm and didn't arrive in downtown S.D. until 3:45pm. That's a trip that normally takes a little over an hour from where I live in Irvine. The 5 freeway is just plain jam packed with too many cars. If they're going to approve all the new housing being built,they might want to think of the impact that it is going to have on congestion. What sucks is that you'd think on a weekend that there would be no traffic, but you would be dead wrong on that assumption. As I was listening to the traffic report on the radio, it was nice to hear that we weren't the only ones suffering. There's too many freakin'people in Southern California for the current roads to handle. I'd be nice if our tax dollars could go towards widening and building new roads, but I guess I won't hold my breath. Here would be my platform if I ever ran for office: #1 would be to widen and build more roads, round up all the illegal immigrants and deport them back home wherever that might be, don't raise any taxes & cut spending across the board to get to balance, and abolish speed limits on the highways. I guess you could boil it down to a platform of "quality of life" issues. Sure there are other things to do, but those would be the things I would concentrate on.

      If everyone in California and the nation didn't hear John's interview yesterday with Asa Hutchinson of the Homeland Security Dept, I'm highly suggesting that you take a few minutes and listen to it. It is so frustrating that politicians can't answer simple questions that are put to them.  urlLink Here is the link for the audio . The southern border is such a mess, but what also is a mess is the fact that two million illegal immigrants are in California at this time and finally when the Border Partol inland enforcement made headlines by grabbing over 400 hundred illegals in the Riverside/Inland empire, they are ordered to stop because the immigrant activists protested louder than us ordinary citizens. Here is a summary of the interview  A month ago, immigration activist groups like La Raza (The Race. How's that for a nice inoffensive name?) were howling in uproar because the 12 Border Patrol officers of the Temecula office were conducting sweeps in Temecula, Escondido, and Corona, all of which are cities located in Riverside and northern San Diego counties.  Complaints about these sweeps aroused the ire of not only the activists, but the Mexican government, whose LA consulate expressed its displeasure in no uncertain terms. Members of Congress also got involved, berating Homeland Security for the sweeps as well.  About a week after the complaints, spokesmen for the Border Patrol said that Asa Hutchinson the undersecretary responsible for the BP, ordered them to stop the sweeps. So, John got an interview with Hutchinson, which aired live this afternoon in the 4:00 hour.  John, who is not a tactful guy, bluntly asked Hutchinson why he ordered the patrols stopped. Hutchinson began droning on about the need for coordination, and about how many illegals (16,000 per week, according to Hutchinson) were being stopped from coming into the country in Arizona.  John cut him off and began demanding to know how many illegals were being rounded up in California. Hutchinson didn't know. John then began grilling him about how many employers had been indicted in Southern California for hiring illegals. Hutchinson said he didn't know. (John did. The answer: 0) John asked if interior enforcement sweeps would begin again. Hutchinson said he couldn't give away specifics about planned operations, for, you know security reasons.  John then pointed out that, if we were unable to stop economic refugees from pouring across the border, how could we possibly stop al-Qaida? Hutchinson said that, yep, that was a pretty important question. You betcha. John asked how Hutchinson planned to react when, after the next 911, we learn that the terrorists came through the Mexican border in California. Hutchinson said that it was really important to stop them.  At the end of the interview, John kept demanding a yes or no answer to the following question: "Can I tell my listeners that Asa Hutchinson assured me that the interior sweeps by the border patrol would begin again?" Hutchinson refused to answer.

      When else have we been down this road before? I seem to remember back in 1988 when George H.W.Bush picked an obscure Indiana Senator named Dan Quayle to be his running mate and he was belittled for it. The media was complaining of Quayle's lack of "gravitas". Now I know that the mainstream media is going to treat Edwards with kid gloves because he is a democrat, but it is an interresting moment of history repeating itself. John Edwards is a lightweight. Besides being a senator for the last six years, he has no real experience to speak of. I don't count chasing ambulances as experience if your wondering. Edwards even admitted that he didn't start voting until a few years before he ran for the senate. I think we have a case hear of Kerry getting a short lived bounce out the decision, but then as reality sets in, the country is going to fall back on the experience and leadership of Bush/Cheney.

My guess is it will be announced early tomorrow morning, that is of course assuming no one in the campaign leaks the name to Drudge or someone else in the media today. CNN is reporting that the decision has been made. Oh the intrigue. By the way, great fireworks show at Edison field last night.

        Kind of a sad day in Hollywood I guess. Marlon Brando was a great actor. I'll never forget the first time that I saw "The Godfather". It is to this day, in his role of Don Corleone still one of my favorite movies. As I channel surf at night, "The Godfather" must be on at least once a week by my count either on pay channels or free. The line,"I made him an offer he couldn't refuse" was a classic. The scene with the guy waking up with his horse's head in bed wasn't bad either. Other notable performances from him were Superman,Apocalypse Now,A Street Car Named Desire,and On the Waterfront.

        That pissed off look on  urlLink Jesse's  face says it all doesn't it. It says "Pssst,hey Bill, stop that, your telling the truth, I can't handle the truth." Bill had this to say, "Stop beating up your women because you can't find a job", and "Let me tell you something, your dirty laundry gets out of school at 2:30 every day, it's cursing and calling each other n------ as they're walking up and down the street," or how about "They think they're hip," the entertainer said. "They can't read; they can't write. They're laughing and giggling, and they're going nowhere", and "I can't even talk the way these people talk, 'Why you ain't,' 'Where you is' ... and I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk," Cosby said then. "And then I heard the father talk ... Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth", and for good measure "When you put on a record and that record is yelling `n----- this and n----- that' and you've got your little 6-year-old, 7-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car, those children hear that." Thank you Mr. Cosby for saying what is obvious from someone who has the credibility to say that. Any white person aka "cracka or wonderbread" who says anything like what Bill said would be branded a racist, but since Bill said it, whoa, that's why jesse has that look on his face.

Most of the guys out there looked burned out. They didn't have any energy or passion. We should get back to using college guys who have not been through an 82 game regular season plus multiple playoff games. We just got a good old fashioned ass-kicking. I'll be surprised if they even get a medal if they keep playing like the way they played today.

       urlLink U.S Rep Darrell Issa held a townhall style meeting today in Temecula on the illegal immigration issue with Undersecretary of Homeland Defense Asa Hutchinson as his guest . I don't know what Darrell was expecting, he tried to run interference for Asa, but the crowd was not swayed a bit by this slight of hand. The crowd "gets it" and Hutchison looked like a deer in the headlights. I think he was expecting a normal suburban Republican townhall meeting where everyone is kissing ass with the politicians, but instead he got the angry mob demanding answers about the interior border sweeps. One of the questions Asa asked the crowd was for intelligence of where all the illegals were. The crowd started yelling "Home Depot". It was totally hilarious yet totally accurate. Our politicians don't get it about illegal immigration but the average citizen does. They need to keep the interior enforcement up because it is effective and it is a great deterent. John & Ken showed up at the rally with their trademark bullhorn and a broom symbolizing the need to keep the interior sweeps going. Asa kept asking Darrell to come to his rescue, but the crowd was not buying his act. We need to send a message to these stupid politicians until they get it. I also noted that today was the deadline for David Dreier to appear on John & Ken's radio show and he did not make it. He is about to find out about the power of the "angry mob" as J&K have coined their listeners. We tossed out a child molester judge in Orange county and recalled a governor with their megaphone on KFI and we are about to show David Dreier the power of the illegal immigration as an issue. I think David Dreier is a great guy, but he just doesn't get it. He will in November.

One of his former male aides had resigned awhile back under a cloud of suspicion. We found out today that the aide is filing a sexual harassment suit against the Governor. With all this hanging over Gov. McGreevey's head, he will be submitting his resignation effective November 15th of this year. This is such a sad story on so many levels. He was a husband and a father. His career was on a upward trajectory that had unlimited potential, but he squandered it all to have an extramarital affair with another guy!

      Just when I thought California had gone over the liberal edge,  urlLink The Ca. Supreme Court today announced that they are voiding all gay marriages that happened about six months ago . This brings a little sanity back into process in my opinion. If the people of California wanted gay marriage, they would have voted for it when it was on the ballot a few years ago. As it stands right now though, mayors do not have free reign to hand out marriage licenses like Gavin Newsome did. I'm sure that gay marriage proponents are filling out their appeal to the Ninth Circuit as I'm writing this. I am predicting right here and now that the Ninth Circus err Circuit will overturn the California Supreme Court ruling and that the US Supremes will have to again slap the liberal 9th judges back down.

They say if they let Wal-Mart into L.A. to open more stores that it would cost the city & state something like 86 million dollars in welfare & health care benefits because Wal-Mart is not unionized, but they don't mind shelling out 5 billion a year for illegal alien services. What am I missing here? Nothing except blatant hypocracy by Los Angeles, but I am not surprised. They don't mind paying for all the illegal alien services, that's okay by them, but absorbing a little cost for Wal-Mart is bad.

The caption the picture shoulda read, "Wow, I made alot of money in futures". By the way, the firm where she had her brokerage account was busted by the CFTC for placing illegal "out trades" in her account. Those are trades that happened after the end of trading and are prohibited by rule. Some how though, she always managed to beat the rap.

William Danko talks alot about this subject in his book  urlLink "The Millionaire Next Door" and the "Millionaire Mind" . One of the types of investments that alot of super rich people use are hedge funds and managed futures. These are investment vehicles that most people know nothing about or don't have access to. Some of the ones that my clients are in are up over 500% in the last four years with basically a flat stock market during that time. I also must emphasize that there is risk with these investments just like there is risk when your money is in the stock market and past performance does not indicate future results.

I wish I had a crystal ball, I don't know. I do know that once the S&P broke 1077 today that it was headed lower. I love talking the stock market and different stratagies & investments with people.

      and the Bush re-elect futures contract is down two points to 52%. There's not much to spin here by the Bush campaign. While I agree that with them that the Labor Dept. stats don't measure alot of other types of jobs like self-employment,independent contractors and entrepeneurs, it doesn't change the fact that most people just look at the Labor Dept stats. The bond market had a huge rally this morning as well. What does all this mean? Bush is behind a little in the media polls , but he is still the favorite according to the all important futures market. My prediction is that he will come out of the convention tied in the polls and about right where he is today in the futures. The debates and or a future event are going to decide the election.

      I found this article by a guy named  urlLink Jim Garven . It is must reading for political prognosticators. I copied and pasted the article here.It is from about one week ago.  Political "futures" markets   The idea of relying upon futures markets prices to forecast future events has an interesting history. Nearly 20 years ago, Richard Roll published a paper in the American Economic Review entitled "Orange Juice and Weather" which showed, among other things, that the futures market in orange juice concentrate is a better predictor of Florida weather than the National Weather Service. Since the only way one can earn excess profits in a speculative market is to gain an informational advantage over the competition, traders are strongly motivated to try to do just that. As I noted in my previous blog entry about political "futures" markets if markets are informationally efficient, it follows that market prices represent unbiased forecasts concerning future events. Technically, this means that on average, the market's estimate of the average value of the event in question is likely to be quite accurate. Consequently, I believe that political "futures" markets are more reliable indicators of the odds of a Bush or Kerry win than surveys conducted by the various media companies. With this in mind, it is interesting to observe what the political futures markets are telling us. As Alex Tabarrok notes, the market prediction of a Bush victory has hit an all-time low; I just checked the tradesports.com website, and today's closing price for the PRESIDENT.GWBUSH2004 futures contract (George W. Bush is re-elected as United States President) is $49.60, which indicates that the election today is quite literally a tossup (note: since the tradesports contracts pay off $100 if a predefined event occurs and $0 otherwise, the reported price is essentially a probability measure). However, it does appear that regardless of which party wins the presidential election, the House and Senate will most likely have Republican majorities. This is evident because today's closing price for the SENATE.GOP.2004 futures contract (Republicans maintain control of the US Senate in 2004 Election) is $76.50, whereas today's closing price for the HOUSE.GOP.2004 futures contract (Republicans maintain control of the House in 2004 Election) is $87.  As of today 8/5/04, The re-elect George W Bush contract is at $55.00

      In a lopsided  urlLink 71-29% tally , voters of Missouri have made their voices heard loud and clear, no gay marriage. This is unless of course a federal judge steps in and slaps an injuction on the referendum for being unconstitutional. I'm wondering how long it will take for the lawsuit papers to be filed by the ACLU or like organization. I put the over/under on it at 45 days. The Defense of Marriage Act(DOMA) days are numbered I get the feeling. This just reinforces the urgency of re-electing George W Bush. There will probably be at least two retirements next year on the US Supreme Court. There might be up to four vacancies in the next coming four years on the court. I predict justices Stevens,Rhenquist, and O'Conner to be likely choices for retirement.

Now Kobe will have to deal with a civil lawsuit. Once the criminal suit is dropped, I'm guessing his lawyers will get together with the accusers lawyers and work out a settlement. You dodged a bullet Kobe. Now just get on with the business of bringing back LA another ring.

Something is definately happening now. I can sense it. For people that trade stocks or futures it's the same feeling you get when all your trading indicators are aligning and screaming at you to BUY or to go SHORT if your talking about John Kerry. I'd margin to the hilt right now and bet on Bush.

      Take a look at this chart from  urlLink Iowa Electronic Markets . As you can see, Bush saw his low water mark on the first day of the Democratic Convention where he was trading at 49%. At the end of trading today, he was at 54%. I keep harping on it, but this is in my opinion the most accurate indicator of sentiment out there.   Over at  urlLink Intrade Presidential Futures , Bush is winning all the states that he won back in 2000 except for the state of New Hampshire. He is not winning any Gore states from 2000. Therefore if these numbers stand for the 2004 election, then Bush would win with 274 electoral votes. This is three more electoral votes than 2000 when Bush received just over the magical number and got 271 electoral votes. Thank you reapportionment.

      but John Kerry has proved me wrong. I was just watching Wolf Blitzer on CNN's Morning Edition and their poll numbers taken after Kerry's speech show no bounce at all for Kerry with registered voters and a negative bounce(or thud!) with likely voters,OUCH! As soon as CNN posts the numbers of the poll on their website, I will link to it. Granted this is only one poll, but as I have been saying, the futures market is going to be the best indicator to watch from now until election day. What's going to be funny though is watching all the Kerry talking heads trying to spin the results of this new CNN poll.
