      The sky is falling.   It is crying a river of rain that runs down the window like tears,  violent and torrential.   Is the day sad?  Does the earth mourn?   Maybe it is angry. Plenty of reasons for it to be.   It could be that the weather is the earth’s way of expressing itself.

      I love watching people.  Diversity is the spice of life, and people are all so different.  It's funny, today I was particularly paying attention to what people wear to work.  I stand in front of my closet every night, knowing that if I don't pick out what to wear the night before, I will be doing this tomorrow (staring blankly into my closet) and it will make me late for work.  So, I was walking across the courtyard into the building.  In front of me was a woman wearing a black, pencil skirt, panty hose, pumps, and then a red, fitted, hooded shirt.  I felt like I should have snapped a photo to send into a magazine where they post pictures with a big "DON'T" next to it. Oh, honey, don't wear a hooded shirt with a business outfit...  You know that part in the "Wizard of Oz" where Dorothy is walking down the road and along comes the wicked little lady on her bicycle?  That little wicked witch theme song starts to play (da, da, ta, na, ta,na,na - da, da, ta, na, ta, na, na), and we all know what it means.  There is one in every office, a little wicked witch who walks to the rhythm of that little song.  The little lady in our office is tiny.  She is tiny, but she has a big office with a really big desk and a really big attitude.  I've also often noticed her coming out of the handicapped stall of our restroom - the really big one.  She is always charging past, and as you see here coming, you have to fight the urge to start humming that song under your breath.  Aren't stereotypes entertaining?

      Love is a teacher.  We love in order to learn.  Pain is a teacher.  We lose and we hurt, but dammit, we learn something.  You could conclude that we love to learn, because we so often long for love.  Love inevitably brings that other teacher, pain.    I do not so much long for love as I long for a resting place (though love should provide a resting place).  Because, the thought of losing love is made that much worse by the realization that you no longer have a "home" and have to pack your bags.  Get back on the road, where you had been, just trudging along, when someone pulled over and picked you up.  Taking a chance on a lonely traveler, like picking up a hitchhiker or finding a stray cat.  He took you home, and you sat with him on the back porch.  He smiled and leaned into you, and you took a deep breath for the first time in what seemed like forever.  Ah, rest, you thought.  Finally I can rest.    But, like the stray that you are, one day you realize you are constantly getting underfoot.  You rub up against the now familiar warmth, you purr, and curl up in his lap - as you normally do.  Then, he sneezes.   “Oh, I’m allergic to you,” he says, a bit concerned, “and, well, now that I think about it, I prefer tabby to calico (or Siamese or Persian - whatever it is that you are not).  Yeah, I’m afraid this is not going to work out, but we had some good times.”   Inside, you feel broken and stunned, you should have trusted your instincts when they first told you to run.  Still, outside you are very much composed.    Like a lioness, you hop down and stretch, then lick each of your paws, “No, don’t get up, I know how busy you are.  I can show myself out the door.”    You've done this before.     I take it back. It is not the loss of love, but the loss of hope that hurts the most (for love, if it really was love, would never have gone). The discovery of love, your heart’s home, was the hope.  Love was hope’s empty promise.  The lesson we learn is one your mom taught you long ago.  Don’t go riding in cars with boys, no matter how tempting the offer.

      Life is too short for artificial sweeteners. I mean, really!  Considering the fact that scientist feel the need for caution, by performing extensive testing on rodents with the ingredients of these sweeteners, people should be more tentative about using them. At Starbucks this morning, for the first time, I stood next to someone who uses just as much sugar as I do in my coffee.  It was refreshing.   My boyfriend, who simply does not sweeten his coffee (hard-core caffeine addict), has only recently stopped watching in alarm as I empty packet after packet of raw sugar (or the regular old white stuff, when the other in not available) into my coffee cup.  In addition to the possible harmful effects of artificial sweeteners, they just don't even taste good.  There is always a funny aftertaste left in your mouth.  Then you feel guilty when you sneak that cookie, or break down and buy the brownie or muffin staring at your from behind the glass as you check out at at your local coffee shop.  Don't you dare turn around and put Sweet & Low or Splenda in that drink, after what you just did!?!  The way I see it, if you just cut back on the extra cookies, cakes, soda, and other junk, then you could sweeten your drinks as you please, and live guilt free. C'mon, I can't believe anyone honestly PREFERS the fake sweet flavor.  Life is to short not to be able to enjoy these things fully.

      I don't have room for clutter in my life.  There is just too much stuff all around.  I love shopping as much as, if not more than, the next woman. But, where they collect, I replace and update.  "Out with the old and in with the new!"  New acquisitions give me an excuse to dispose of the extra, the superfluous, the substitutions for what I really want.  I have learned not to hold too tightly to anything.  Loss is expected, it is a part of everything.  Look at nature -, always from birth, to growth, to death: loss.  Or life - birth, growth, independence, dependence, then death: loss.  Love - birth, growth, death: loss.  Push me, and I give, I am yielding.  It is the natural cycle.  Resistance is futile.  I can always start over again.

      (March 2, 2004) There is always a sound of air blowing somewhere.  I sit at my desk, and I hear it overhead.  Oxygen and temperature control.  Sounds, I hear so many sounds.  This morning, standing at the sink: water rushing through the pipes, the stool sliding across the tiled floor, and a high pitched electronic buzz nearby.  My shoes in a sharp staccato on the wood floor, muffling on the pavement as I go to open my car door.  The engine turning and grating, it starts, then that obnoxious loose belt starts it’s ringing, squealing complaining.  I turn up the volume on the car stereo, and the thumping bass makes my butt vibrate.  Thinking of that asshole the other night, rushing me to turn right on red, his car horn honking repeatedly. I raised my arm and let my finger shout back at him.  Walking the fire escape stairs to floor 19, my rings tapping on the metal railing. I hum as I walk, good acoustics in here.  Another mumbled “hello” from the secretary that sits there.  She’s already seen me many times today.  The heels on my shoes announce my presence in the hall. The voices I overhear as I pass each room are very rarely worth listening to.  Somewhere a phone rings.  I want to go sit in the stairwell and sing.

      They say to take time, to stop and smell the roses. In this office there are plenty of roses.  Beautiful and hothouse grown, they smell only of slightly sweet, dry office air.  Not quite stale, just dry.  Stale. I have grown stale. I remember when (it was only about 6 weeks ago), I was the exciting new employee.  Now, a month and a half later, I have grown stale and disappointing somehow.  They were expecting big changes, perhaps miracles. I wrought big changes, but not miracles, and now they are bored.    Stale.  My outlook has grown stale.  I am tired of stale. The loss of life. My life is stale. The sympathies once offered me have grown stale.  The constant anger leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. It is in the air and makes everything taste stale.  Even the constant mumbling sadness I feel is stale.  And by now this complaint is certainly...

      (3/28/04) 	Well, I am here now, at work.  It’s Monday.  It is raining outside.  Dreary day, and I am already more than ready to go home or crawl under my desk and take a nap.  This morning saw me leaving for work late, with Cara crying that she did not want me to go.  Then, I walked into the 18th floor kitchen, and the cover of the Time Magazine caught my eye - a mother with a small, happy child and the title, “The Case for Staying Home” across the bottom of the picture. I gritted my teeth and fought the urge to put a post-it on the Magazine with something like, “fuck you” written in bold, red letters.  If I had the option, I sure as hell would not be here.  In a way, I was offended that someone would so tactlessly put that in here.  	I thought specifically of Valerie, who sits next to me, and just returned from maternity leave.  She is just learning the meaning of mommy guilt, as she tears herself away from her new baby girl every morning.  Every 2-4 hours, she finds an empty conference room or office where she can use her breast pump.  There is the secretary on the 19th floor who is due any day now and walks through the hall with her hand always protectively over her belly.  Cara, my 4 year old, is so disturbed that I now work full time that she worries in her sleep and wakes up repeatedly.  We  take ourselves to court daily, building a case to come here.  This is not a career.  This is not where we find purpose and meaning.  This is our sentence.  This is survival.  Outside, it is still raining.    		*	*	*	*	* 3/30/04 It’s probably not a good thing when the contents of the bottles under your kitchen sink are of more interest to you - as possible ingredients for a mixed drink – than those in the liquor cabinet.  When, while filling up the bathtub with water, the thought, “This could be my grave…” flitters across your brain. 	 An end.  An end to all that your future promises to be.  Suicide, that terrible word, become a tantalizing idea, but not something you could actually ever go through with, not with a clear conscience.  And who can face death, truly face it, with a burdened conscience.  As much as you think that everyone else really would be better off… (and honestly, they could very well be) you know that deep inside it does not matter.  The trauma of your exit, their release, would outweigh the benefits. So, suicide, the idea of it, the impossibility of it, entertains and somehow relieves some of the pressure built up inside.    Driving to and from work every day, at every turn and intersection, you wonder, “Could this be it?”  Always partially cocked, ready for the 18 Wheeler to come barreling into the driver’s side of your car; for the idiot in front of you to suddenly slam on his breaks, while going 70 miles an hour, so you can’t stop soon enough, and your head smashes though the windshield; for someone to back up in the parking lot, not looking, while you walk unsuspectingly behind their car with your arms full of groceries.  Yet, even there, death is not a certainty, otherwise more of us would step dazedly into traffic the next time we had the urge. If an end was guaranteed. If you could save everyone else from you, what wouldn’t you do?  Your kidding yourself, though, if you think your motives purely unselfish.  “I’m doing this for them,” to help them by removing yourself…bullshit.  The truth is, though that may in fact play a significant role in motivation (and again, it may be an accurate deduction); the truth is, you look ahead into a future filled with every day of this feeling, of no real hope of happiness or color to life, and you want to die – would rather die – than have to live another day like this.  There is no hope that it might get better, that “the skies may turn blue again” – even if you know (if you were really honest with yourself) that the possibility exists.  Right here, right now, the tunnel doesn’t have an end and there is no light to head towards.  There is no objectivity in despair.  It looks at logic, unflinchingly.  It faces reality, directly, and says, “ I don’t fucking care how this could get better or what might change in the future. This is now, I am here, and I am buried alive.”

      Pop-up adds on the internet are the biggest pain in the ass.  There you are, just trying to read or get something else accomplished, and then suddenly, POP! a little box jumps onto your computer screen and screams, LOOK AT ME, LOOKE AT ME, LOOK AT ME.  Let me guess, I'm the 1,263,452,301 visitor to this sight and that means I win something?  Great.  Now all I have to do is click on this button and read this add, oh, and fill in this survey... What's that?  There's another page of special offers I just have to see? Ok, well, I mean if I just have to look for a minute.  A free I-Pod would be cool.  Yeah, "free". And the boxes open one, after the other, until finally they ask for your credit card number. Hmmm, now why would they need a credit card number if it is free?  Oh, and hopefully you didn't put your real email address in all those little forms and surveys you filled out... because the next time you check email, you will have 10 messages from God knows where with more "free" offers and "great deals".  So, now it's an hour later, and I can't remember what I was doing before all this started. In the last hour, I think I entered a poetry contest... I might be getting some coupons in the mail for chocolate chips... that vacation offer was kind of tempting... but I stopped myself before I slid all the way down the slippery slope of free offers.  Man, they ask for my credit card number, and I have to draw the line. So, no free IPod today.  Bummer.

      If you could go back and change anything about your life, what would it be?  If we are the sum of our many experiences, then changing something about my past could change who it is I have become.  It could alter other decisions I made after that, setting off a different chain of events.  If that happened, where and who would I be right now?   I close my eyes, and I can picture myself somewhere else...  I am sitting in a dark corner of a dusty cafe, somewhere in the Middle East, travel worn and nearly unrecognizable.  With my dyed skin and a veil over my face, I have seen things few other have.  Pen in hand, I am scribbling down ideas for my next article...  I am on stage, and the roar of the crowd is nearly deafening.  Sweat dampens the back of my shirt and the microphone is a little slippery in my hand.  The music surrounds me and I begin to sing, feeling that soaring, heady freedom.  I can barely hear myself over the people singing every word to my songs...  A mosquito buzzes in my ear, and I swat at it.  A voice calls out to me in a language not my own, but I understand it and reply in the same.  I am unpacking medical supplies from the back of a large truck, the African sun beating down on my back.  Water is in short supply this year, but with our help, the natives will make it through the drought this year.  Sometimes I miss the cool fall and winter seasons we had in the States, but the work is so rewarding - saving hundreds of lives from starvation and disease every week...  I hear little laughing voices come from down the hall. “It’s almost time for dinner,” I call out.   “Ok, mommy,” they answer. “Would you go tell Daddy to hurry up?”  I turn of the stove and turn to set the table for four.  It’s so nice now that we can all sit together and there are no more messy high chairs to clean up.  The girls come running into the room.  “Daddy’s almost finished with our tree house!” they excitedly announce together.   I nod and smile, thankful that he was willing to do this on his day off, even though I am always home.  The girls will both be in school this fall, though, and I am thinking I might go back to work part-time...  Then, I open my eyes, and I am still sitting here in front of the computer screen.  It’s lunch time, and the office has cleared a little bit.  I have a grocery list in front of me, trying to figure out what to make for dinner.  I am hoping the kids have a good nap today, so that our few hours together tonight are pleasant.  Traffic was so bad coming into work this morning, I hope it is better tonight.  I wonder if I will have time to sit down and work on those songs tonight, but probably not.  The evening will doubtless end with me washing the dishes and finishing the laundry.  I think I’ll pick up a bottle of wine to keep me company, and maybe something good will be on TV...

      Let's talk for a moment about breastfeeding.  What are my qualifications, you ask?  I'm a mom.  I have breastfed 2 children, and if I ever have any more children, I look forward to the opportunity of doing it again in the future.  The benefits are countless.    1) Breastfeeding aids in the prevention of breast cancer.  2) It is scientifically proven to be better for children, both for it's physical nutritional value and contribution to healthy brain development.    3) Antibodies (see #2)  4) Mother and child bonding (once you get through the initial pain - cracked and  bleeding nipples, the possibility of public boob exposure, and the occasional biting - once teething begins...)  5) Prevention of allergies (see #2)  6) Less diaper bag paraphernalia (like bottles and formula)  7) More constructive use of time (instead of needing to purchase bottles and sterilize them, heating water, mixing formula and water - usually resulting in some sort of mess)  8) Economical (booby milk is cheap)  Need I say more?  To all those macho feminist who don't want babies, I argue that giving birth and breastfeeding is extremely empowering.  How could it not be?! Only a woman has the ability to create and sustain life with and within her body.  Well, ok, we can't create completely alone. We do need that sperm from you guys, but we do all the work.  Not to mention, physical scars.   I recently went bathingsuit shopping.  Not fun, when you have stretch marks.  Especially if you are partial to 2 piece bathing suits, and honestly, most stores don't carry a large variety of cute one pieces.  I have a virtual road map of stretch marks lining my abdomen.  My daughters ask me all the time, "Mommy, why do you have scratches on your tummy?"  I very gently remind them, even to the point of pulling out pictures of me pregnant, that they are from them.  Not in a blaming sort of way, more like a reminder of what I was willing to go through because of my love for them.  "It's squishy, Mommy!"  And I love them for it.    No matter what anyone says or what products claim to be able to do, stretch marks are genetic.  Bottom line: if your mom has them, then you are likely to as well.  I was prepared for mine, but I still fought them like hell.  For 9 months, my bathroom constantly smelled of cocoa butter and other products that promised to "prevent stretch marks".  Nevertheless, around 6 1/2 months into the pregnancy, my tummy started to itch, and then these little spots appeared.  It was kind of strange to watch them gradually progress, as my stomach grew, from round marks to long jagged lines as my stomach grew.  It wasn't like I was huge.  I only gained about 35 lbs with each of my pregnancies (by the way, I think that Kate Hudson reportedly gained 70+ lbs. with her pregnancy).  So, I embraced my "battle scars."  After Cara (my oldest) was born and my body started to recover, I was relieved when I realized that the stretch marks just fell short of coming out of the top of my bikini bottoms.  A few months later, even before my hair had stopped falling out (another fun post-pregnancy thing), I found out I was going to be having another baby.  I had already lost more than my pregnancy weight, and I thought that my stretch marks couldn't get any worse...   The other day, I showed Cara which stetch marks were from her (all of them), and then I turned to Adia (my youngest) and told her, "See up here, the top inch of all of these is from you."  Being a mother of two has stretched me farther - in more ways than one, sometimes farther than I think I am able to go.  The girls seem almost proud to own the responsibility for my stetch marks, and so I think I can bear them unabashedly.  I bought a new bathing suit the other day.  A 2 piece.  I will show the world that I am empowered, and I hope I can do my part to empower the next generation of women.

      I am just appalled.  What kind of idiots are running this country?  How is that the President and his advisors are forever uninformed or misinformed?  It reeks of deception or extreme stupidity.  This week the media stuns us with pictures of the brutal treatment some of the members of our army have inflicted on prisoners in the Middle East.  I thank the media. For all of it’s faults, were it not for them, many injustices would be allowed to continue.    oh, but the President and Defense minister didn’t know about it…  Of course, they found out only just before we did.  Well, maybe they didn’t, but I find that possibility (besides being a bit hard to swallow) even more appalling.  It is sounds too much like September 11th, and so many other incidences, where the President was once again “uninformed.”  I want to know why he doesn’t have spies.  And, if he does have spies, they should be fired for their complete incompetence.  The Secret Service is a misnomer.  Nothing secretive about the services they perform.  What else do they do besides protect the physical safety of the President and talk on those little black headsets?  I would almost feel safer if there were more secrets.  If the President knew more than we knew, if he was more capable than anyone else.  Why can’t Superman be the President?    We long to be inspired.  We crave a Presidential Candidate in whom we can be confident that the running of this country is a top priority.  No more popularity contests.  No more greed.  No more celebrity politicians.   HELP WANTED: SERVANT AND MANAGER FOR A LARGE NATION.  MUST BE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT AND EXTREMELY HUMBLE.  IF INTERESTED, PLEASE CALL ME.  –CONCERNED AMERICAN CITIZEN

      Sometimes there is just too much going on to write about.  Especially when most of it is internal activity.  What you think.  What you feel.  The transition of perspective and belief.    I want…  It changes every week.  I want to be a rockstar.  I want to be super-mom.  I want to be famous.  I want to be rich.  I want to sleep.  I want world peace.  I want to run away.  I want to be happy.  I want simplicity.  I want to sit quietly.  I want to party.  I want love.  I want to be alone.  I want everything.  I don’t want anything.  We never want the same thing, but we always want the same things.    We are nothing if not creatures of extreme habit.  It makes us comfortable.  Consistency.  Then, some of us consistently want change, maybe because change has become a habit.  However, we still crave consistency, and so we are never truly comfortable with the changes.  Yet, we don’t know how to change.    I ask myself daily, what do I want?  The answer is always changing.

      I want to rock.  Not to necessarily be a rock star, but I want to be able to stand up on a stage and play an electric guitar.  I want to eat the mic and flail around on stage.  To moan and wail song lyrics with an energy that pulses and inspires.  I want to write songs like Patti Smith in the 70's, with Gwen Stefani's energy and girlyness, while channeling a little of the raw and wild sexuality of Courtney Love. Tired of tamely strumming acoustic guitar, melodic with melancholy and love.  I don't want to sit on a stool and croon.  Give me throbbing bass and a driving beat.  Dirty hair and tattoos.  I wanna rock.

      I woke up today, and everything was different. The world around me looks the same, but it feels different. It's almost as though I have spent my life - up to this point - looking through a smudged window, that has grown dirtier every year. I've windexed the inside a thousand times, but I can only get this one side clean. Then, somebody comes along on the outside, wipes their hand across the middle of the glass and says, "Now, look."

      I love the people who will say anything.  Like the receptionist at this office.  She's one of those people with whom no topic is off limits for discussion.  I remember one day when she drew a little picture of her childhood pet -- a hamster with oversized balls.  I have rarely laughed that hard.  Then, today, somehow we got on the topic of the difference between how much time men and women take on the toilet.  And then onto toilet paper use.  Next thing I knew, we were discussing her wiping techniques.  Out came the pen and the little piece of paper for a diagram.  When was the last time someone drew a diagram of how they wipe their ass for you?  Oh, it was funny.

      Somebody gave me a little American flag today, I picked it up, looked at it, and felt nothing.  No, actually, that's not true. I did feel something.    I felt like the colors were too bright and the pattern too busy.  Too many stripes and too many stars.  I felt tired of seeing it everywhere, and as we draw closer to July 4th, that is bound to increase.  I guess I am thankful that I am a citizen of a country that has economic strength and social freedom.  But, I am not proud of it.  More often than not, I am embarrassed.   But, then, I am a woman without a country.  I have spent more time, total, living in other countries than I have in my own.  In the Philippines, the kids used to run up to me and yell, "Hey, Joe!"  What they remembered was the American G.I.'s who helped them win political freedom.  Then, we designed their government to be just like ours, and to this day, it still doesn't work.  In Europe, America is an embarrassment, just a baby.  To Eastern Europe, America is the land of milk and honey.  In Russia, they love America for movies and Coca-Cola, for rock music, freedom.  America the land of strength and stupidity.  When was that last time that we could look at the figurehead, the leader of our nation, and know that he was respected across the ocean.  How far back do we have to go, before they were bumbling idiots, with a Cheshire cat grin and so much to make fun of on SNL.  I hate our political structure and foreign politics.    But I like the idea of our country, my country, which I guess it is.  I like the ideas of the forefather's of this nation.  The Declaration of Independence.  Memorizing the Preamble to the Constitution.  Growing up outside of my country, those were the things I was proud of, those words, those ideas.  That was my America.  Those are the things I still remember.  I was taught that we are supposed to have a government, "Of the people, by the people, and for the people."  That "all men are created equal... with certain, unalienable rights... life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."    Or how about this: "Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  I guess I'm just disappointed, and I don't really like the American flag - for purely aesthetic reasons.

      In the office kitchen today, the smell of food was heavy in the air.  But it didn't smell like real food, not a mouth watering, appetizing smell.  Still, it was a familiar scent.  Not just because I smell it everyday, but something about that smell tickles at the corner of my brain, in a memory.  I couldn't quite place it, at first, then it hit me.  Like coming out of a hypnotic state, when the bell chimes.  The microwave beeped  to announce that another frozen dinner was ready to be eaten.  At that moment, the scent and the memory collided.  Airplane food.  Frozen dinners taste and smell just like airlplane food.  I mean, that is basically what the food is that you get on an airplane.  Food that has been frozen and then defrosted until it is really, really hot, burning the tips of your fingers as you work the tinfoil off the top.    Now, why would you want to eat that stuff at any other time?  I mean, we eat airplane food, because, after 8 hours of flying you are hungry enough to eat anything.  It's not as though you have anything better to do, trapped in a too small seat, listening to the breathing of the other people pressed in around you, and watching reruns of CNN on the tiny TV screen.  What I don't understand is why you would ever go to the grocery store, and buy packages of Lean Cuisine, Healthy Choice, Stouffers, or whatever happens to be your preferred brand of frozen, pre-prepared food.    I am sympathetic to the monotony of making your own lunch and the expenses of take-out for the nine to fiver.  Don't get me wrong. But, let's leave airplane food to be eaten only when you're in the sky.

      We are getting ready to take a road trip.  Nashville to Maine, to spend our vacation with my boyfriend’s family.  They do this every year, but I think he usually flies up there.  I keep warning him that it won’t be like the other trips he and I have taken together, since Cara and Adiaare also coming.  Traveling with a three year old and four year old is going to b e new experience for him.  Especially since up until recently he was the quintessential bachelor.  Though he gets an uncertain look in his eyes, when I remind him of this, he is quick to reassure me (and himself) that it will be fun.  I think he is remembering what it was like to travel, as a child, and still views things from that perspective.  Still, I hope he's right.  I hope it is fun.  I remember being young and taking long trips with my family.  My sister and I would sit, cramped with all the baggage, in the backseat.  It seems like we always had so much stuff.  For a while, we would argue and push each other off our “side” of the seat.  Then, after hours, or maybe even days, of being trapped in such a small space together, we would reach a point of extreme silliness.  We would sing songs, loudly and intentionally off-key, throw toys or food, twist our bodies sideways and upside down, and drive my parents crazy with our screeching and laughing.  Initially, they would be amused and relieved that we were no longer fighting.  Mostly, though, I remember that they looked tired.  Sometimes, my mom would sigh out of sheer exhaustion. This was about the time she would start nagging my dad about his driving, telling him to watch the road and stop messing with the stereo.  Music was his escape on those road trips, while my mom simply craved a little peace and quiet.  So, she was thrilled when I discovered my love for reading, and that driving and reading did not make me car sick.    Despite all the chaos, we were fine, and this must be the part that my boyfriend remembers.  Only, this time, he gets to join me in the role of exhausted parent.  We will do all we can to ensure that the trip is bearable for the children, to spare not just their suffering, but also our own.  In the end, though, it all just makes you tired, and the arrival at the destination is that much sweeter for having survived the road getting there.

      Saturday morning, an unhappy Cara crawled into bed with me, "Mommy, I had a bad dream..."  With her growing vocabulary, her descriptions of her dreams is getting really interesting.  She crawled up in bed with me, I listened and reassured her that it was just a dream, and she fell back to sleep.  Well, some sort of strange role reversal must have happened.  Cara's dream had been full of bad guys and good guys, dialogue and even jail cells.  Then, I closed my eyes and came face to face with a monster.  Your classic running from the long snouted, snarling, horned, monster dream.  Quite typically, at the climactic moment, I jumped and woke myself up.  Cara rolled over, ready to talk again, and it was my turn to share a bad dream.  There we were, 8:00 in the morning, talking about our nightmares.  But there was no, "Don't worry, mommy, it's not real."  No reassurances or distractions from thinking about it.  She wanted to know what happened next. Did the monster eat her and Adia? Did I kill the monster? Maybe there were other monsters with him?    What happened next was that I woke up and realized I had been dreaming.  It was all just a bad dream.  Reality was snuggled up next to me, with her head on my shoulder and so much stronger than the monsters beneath my bed.   (forgive the Indigo Girl's lyric theft)

      My yawning is out of control this week.  I’ve decided that either I’m not getting enough oxygen, or I’m not getting enough sleep.  I do need to get back into my regular practice of yoga – with the deep abdominal breathing, but the lack of sleep is probably more likely to be the culprit.  How many 3 and 4 year olds do you know that still take 3 hour naps?  My children do.  They are smart strategists.  Since I have gone back to work, they have figured out that the only time they really get to spend with me is in the evenings.  So, they sleep all afternoon, knowing that if they wake up at 5:30, I am not likely to force them into bed a mere 2 ½ hours later.  Even on those nights when I feel desperately exhausted, and I encourage them to run laps around the coffee table, the schedule stays the same.  By the time we have completed or lengthy bedtime ritual, including whatever new excuses they have come up with to stall the process, it is after 10:00.  There are still dishes to be washed, clothes folded and put away, toys cluttering the floor, bills to be paid, and that relaxing, alone time I have been craving all day.  Sleep has fallen the bottom of my priority list.  There is not enough time for sleep anymore.  (YAWN) There I go again...

      Ok, so maybe giving your kids coffee ice cream before bed is not such a good idea.  In an attempt to quit drinking coffee, I have been buying coffee ice cream to treat myself for such firm resolve.  (No, I don't want to know how close it is to the real thing.  To me, it's not coffee, it's ice cream.)  Of course, I couldn't hide it from the girls.  They haven't touched the chocolate ice cream since.  And now I"m wondering if it's a sign that they are going to be future coffee drinkers (with lots of cream and sugar - just like mommy) when they like to wait until the ice cream is completely melted and room temperature before eating it?    We watched "Breakfast at Tiffany's" last night.  It seemed somehow appropriate, the decadence of drippy, melting, coffee ice cream, while watching Audrey Hepburn munch pastries outside of Tiffany's.  Bedtime could wait.  Then, after the movie, after the effects of the coffee ice cream had worn off, two sleepy little girls crawled into bed, the strains of "Moon River" still floating in their heads.

      "Mommy I want a baby brother," Cara said to me last night.    We were sitting around the table eating dinner, or trying to at least.  Instead of eating, the girls were distract me with every topic of conversation possible.  Well, Cara was.  Adia was just making silly noises and faces to make me laugh.  Eventually, they brought up the usual, "Mommy, why aren't you and Daddy married anymore?"   "But, I want you to be together," Adia protested. "You don't have to fight."    It's a reoccuring discussion we have about once a week.  It is not even that they like us in the same room together.  Sunday, when Drew dropped the kids off, they practically herded him out the door.  And, they actually really like my boyfriend.  They think he's great and talk about him all the time (which I'm sure their Dad loves).  There are no tears about it anymore, but now that they can carry on a conversation, they want to know about everything.  As much as they have adjusted to going back and forth every week, they understandably would prefer if they could have both of their parents under one roof at the same time.  In addition to that, they are also entering the "Why" stage.       I will say that last night, I think I came up with one of my best illustrative explanations yet.  I asked them to think about the puzzles that they play with, and how sometimes, some of the pieces fit together and others don't.  I told them that their Dad and I were like 2 puzzle pieces that you tried to put together, but they didn't fit.  Then they asked me who I was going to marry next, when I was getting married again.  I tried to impress upon them the importance of being careful, being sure about who you plan to marry.  Not rushing and making a mistake, like I did before.  Although, I made sure they knew they were not a mistake.  That no matter what happened, even if me and Daddy didn't love each other anymore, we would always love them.  That seemed to be enough for them, for the time being.     Cara smiled and said, "Well, when I'm 5, you can get married to somebody else and have a baby brother for me."    Adia chimed in, "And one for me too!"  When she is 5, Cara is going to be able to do everything.  When she is 5, she is going to be an artist.  When she turns 5, She is going to marry Cole (her "boyfriend").  After all, 5 years old is all grown up.  Thankfully, after that, she dropped the baby brother bit.  Then, it was back to complaining about how she didn't want to eat the food on her plate...

      “There is no such thing as magic,” I found myself telling my 4 year old, Cara, on the way home from a movie tonight. Of course, all of this needs to be put into context.   I had taken them to see a fairy-tale type movie - complete with princesses, ogres, elves, and (of course) magic. On the way home, Cara started doing her push-mommy’s-buttons-guilt-trip thing, which quickly (as she knew it would) cast a shadow over what had otherwise been an enjoyable evening. I think it must be a control thing. Oh, yeah, and maybe she’s a little mad at me for no longer being married to her dad… But, that is another issue entirely.   We had just been talking about the non-existence of monsters with her younger sister, Adia (who is 3 years old). Ok, so I was still a little disgruntled, and admittedly, hurt (sometimes it’s just too damn hard to be the grown-up and pretend nothing touches you). I was trying to convince Adia that there were no such thing as monsters.   “Monsters are just pretend,” I insisted, with the occasional, “Yeah” thrown in from the peanut gallery.   Then, Cara interjected, “Mommy, why is there magic in my blanket?” And, that was where this all started...   I remember when I was pregnant with Cara, I bought two of the thickest books I could find, just FULL of fairy tales. I emphasized to Drew (the now ex-husband) the importance of an open and imaginative mind. Of course, I was still full of hopes and ideals. I was going to find out how to be the BEST mom ever. I would do everything in my power to ensure I gave birth to the most brilliant and healthy children, and I would give them the most diversely well-rounded environment. Tack onto that a few other unrealistically ideal expectations, and anyone could see I was headed for mountains of disappointment. My children actually have been perfect - perfectly beautiful, exceptionally intelligent and intuitive, and full of good health. It is me, myself, who turned out to be the disappointment. No big surprise, but also an entirely different issue.  Ok, back to magic. Monsters... Magic... Blankets? Yes, magical blankets. That one came back to bite me.   It all started when I went back to work. Cara started “acting out” (as THEY call it). Besides being completely uncooperative, she did not want to sleep in her bed at night, and certainly not alone. One of her favorite lines was, “I’m scared when I'm sleeping. I’m scared of my bed.” So, I had the brilliant idea to tell her that there was magic in her blanket, thinking that it would foster a safe feeling – like, mommy set this blanket to watch over you, always (mm-hmm, even she didn’t buy it). While pregnant with Adia, I had helped my mom sew Cara a quilt to ease her move to a big girl bed. I explained this to her, and I told her that we had sewn the blanket with love and put magic in it to keep her safe. Cara finds a way to disagree with everything or create a complication to it. After that, I often heard her say that the magic in her blanket was bothering her, and she created a whole new set of excuses for not sleeping in her bed, based on that.   Lesson 1: magic is not always good.   Now, returning to being in the car and on the way home from the movie. Cara is being disagreeable. I am feeling injured. We establish and agree together that there are no monsters anywhere, not for real. Then, she asks about the magic in her blanket. I explained the reason again.   “Well, I don’t want a magic blanket,” she declares.   “Ok,” I tell her, exasperated, “there is no such thing as magic. I just meant that the love we put into that blanket can make you feel safe. Magic isn’t real. Monster’s aren’t real. It’s just all pretend!”  (And... BAM!!! Right into that glass bubble of innocence. Big Mommy points for that one.)  We turn the corner. We are nearly home. I am gritting my teeth, willing her not to say one more negative thing. I’m afraid of what else I might say. Luckily, although they always seem to be listening when I wish they wouldn't, they are not really paying attention to me right now. Cara has already moved on to the next thing.   “I don’t want love to be in my blanket,” she mutters.  I sigh with exasperation and tell her, “Cara, that's all there is. Love is the only thing there is that is good in this world, the only magic.” Wondering to myself, as I say these words, how much of their love I have lost.   So, here I am, bereft of personal dreams and full of compromised ideals, trying to grow in my children what I lack. But, I think, or I now realize, that they already have it. And in forcing them to hold onto it, to consciously think of it, rather than be as children naturally are, I could very well crush it. That was the warning that came screaming out at me tonight.   Lesson 2: Let not your bitterness dirty the water of someone else’s well.   Putting the girls to bed, they asked me for the song I always sing to them, “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” I sang so softly, tonight, barely able to get through the words.   “…if happy, little bluebirds fly above the rainbow, why, oh why, can’t I?”

      There is this song that Tori Amos sings called, "I Don't Like Mondays."  I love that song. I hate Mondays.  As she sings, "I wanna shoot the whole day down, down, down, shoot it all down..."  Today it’s Monday, and all of yesterday and today came together in a big blur.  I wish I could wipe the day clean and start over again, then I could be prepared for everything that went awry, that just slipped off track.    Sunday night, I got the girls back from their Dad’s house.  Note to self: Never offer to pick the kids up from Drew’s place again. As tortuous as Cara’s tearful and resentful goodbye is to her Dad when he drops them off, it is that much worse pulling her away from his house and enduring the 15-20 minute ride home.  I felt like a terrible person, taking the poor child away from her father. At the same time, I am deeply injured by the idea that she could love him more than – or even as much as – me.  After all, I keep thinking, he didn’t give birth to her.  He didn’t house her in his body for over 9 months, and then push her out into the world using every ounce of strength in his body.  When did milk ever flow from his breasts to sustain life? (and, for a moment, I feel almost goddess like when I think of women this way – with the ability to house and sustain life…)  Does that mean nothing anymore?   After an exhausting evening of appeasing my Mommy-guilt by trying to make up for every minute, hour, day, and night I have to spend away from them, I stay up nearly the entire evening working on a project for work.  After cleaning the kitchen.  After putting the clothes away.  After taking a rushed shower and deciding that, once again, I do not have enough time to shave my legs. There is not time to complete the day, before the next one begins.  So, today, I am still trying to finish with yesterday and nothing is going right.  Loose ends, losing ends, losing it.   No, I don’t like Mondays.

      I think that the moment children are born, there is fused an invisible chord that connects their mother to them.  We are bound by that, eternally, but it can be damaged. It can be severed. A child can twist it, tug and pull on it, break it, or even rip your heart out with it. Maybe I am being a little dramatic, but it really feels that way sometimes. At four years old, my oldest daughter has already learned how to manipulate. Like a puppet, she jerks my heart around on a string.   My mom, who just came into town, pointed that out to me the other night. Cara was working herself into her usual obstinate “I refusal to cooperate in any way, shape, or form” frenzy, when my Mom turned accusingly to me. “What has happened to you, you didn’t used to be like this?! Take control of your child, take control of your life,” she threw out at me. I threw my hands up, frustrated and resigned, and she took over for me.  She knows that since I hardly see the girls anymore, I hate to be the bad guy during the few hours I have with them at night. “I just don’t know what’s wrong with you. When you are here, you’re not really here. You’re not really anywhere…” she told me.    I could not really disagree with her.  I felt that way, spread so thin that I am never really entirely present in any part of my life.  As a divorced single parent, you have to play every role.  Not only are you still responsible for all the things you did before, but the entire other half of things are now also needing your attention.  I am comforted by the knowledge that at least I have a family to give me some emotionally support, and I can take the criticisms and everything else that comes with that.  I cannot imagine how difficult it is for single-mothers who are truly alone.  At least my ex-husband is not a “dead beat dad,” and he actually is an involved father, although I sometime resent it more than I appreciate it.  But, I am here.  If it sometimes doesn’t seem like it, it’s because I am trying to figure all of this out and still find time to eat, sleep, and breathe.

      I can’t believe I’ve had children with this man, I thought to myself as we walked down the sidewalk. The four of us, nearly a family, except that we weren’t.  We had actually just signed and filed the divorce papers a few weeks ago.  I watched the top of Adia’s curly head and looked at Cara’s newly painted toenails poking of her sandals, while I pretend to listen to their father. Drew was talking animatedly about some new idea for a show he planned to pitch to a local radio station. He was always excited about something new. I tried not to let that thought lead me into bitter territory. I had promised myself I would not be angry today. I had wanted to see the kids, so I had determined to endure his irritating conversation for an hour.  At least he had been accommodating enough to bring them to me on my lunch break, even though it was the start of his weekend with them.  The girls were subdued, and I wondered how they must feel when they are with the two of us.  It was obvious that there was nothing left between us, nothing but our children, and I wondered again at how I had ever had the desire to have a family with this man.  Then, I felt Adia’s soft little hand in mine, and I quieted the thought. I couldn’t imagine a world without them in it.   The downtown library was just across the street from the building I worked in.  We walked in the double doors, and there were moms and children everywhere. Pushing strollers with sandals on, reminding me that I was not part of that world anymore.  I tugged self-consciously at my suit jack and slipped it off my shoulders.  I work full time now and mommy on the side.  I am not sure if I will ever be able to reconcile myself with the guilt I feel at leaving my kids every day, especially since they also spend weekends away at their dad’s house.  I miss our mornings together, snuggling on the couch, drinking chocolate milk and watching “The Wiggles.” I miss lunches on the back porch and trips to the park.  Washing sticky fingers and kissing boo-boos.  I am not even sure how much Adia weighs now or how many inches Cara has grown, but every week they seem to outgrow something else.  That reminded me, I still needed to get that basket of their clean clothes put away.  I am just always so tired when I get home, and dinner needs to be made, the girls fed and bathed. Dishes need to be washed, and toys put away... There is just not enough time anymore.

      The story of a person’s life has so many beginnings. If I could choose, I’d say my life really began on a train bearing West through the midnight desert of New Mexico. The shadows of cactuses chasing the train, the sand everywhere, in every direction, almost white underneath the gaze of the full moon. It seeped into our passenger cars, lightly dusting everything in its path. My daughter Georgia not yet born, but she was the reason my life was racing towards California.  	It was August 1942, the train was packed with soldiers sitting and standing and only because I showed more leg than I should have did I even get a seat. Behind me, not ten feet away, stood a mother tending her four children. I never saw the mother sit down, not any time in the four days it took us to snake across the country. I think she forgot how. One child at her breast, a girl and boy who must have been twins with golden locks the color of honey and another girl, probably about ten, whom the mother sent to beg for water at each stop. Me, all eighteen years of myself, I told a soldier he could kiss me if he got me water. I had a bag of biscuits with me, and a ham I baked before I left Athens.  	The soldiers were heading to begin their own lives as killers and saviors, men-boys all of them, none more than twenty-five years old. One boy was my age, a cute freckled redhead. I woke up one morning to find him staring at me. “You sure did look like an angel when you was sleepin’, miss,” he said.  	I’d fantasized about the two of us kissing in the bathroom, his freckled hands around my waist. He blushed, maybe sensing what I was thinking, and offered me a sip from his flask. “Just water, I promise,” he said.   	“You looked like an angel when you were sleeping, too,” I said.  	But the train isn’t really where my life began. Never mind about the early years – they may have their place, but they didn’t make me who I am. If I’m honest, then I’d have to say my life began a year before that, the day I told my mother and father I was pregnant. Mama stood next to the sink mashing potatoes in a blue glass  bowl. When I said those words, “I’m pregnant,” she dropped her head, silent. But she kept mashing the potatoes, pale hands mixing salty tears in with butter and milk.  	All Daddy said was, “Then you’ll marry him.” And it made sense. Henry and I would graduate high school the next month and marry the day afterwards. I envisioned the Baptist church steps, Henry and I stepping out onto them, he in a fine dark suit and I in a pale pink gown, my stomach barely swollen and a cathedral veil draped behind me. Our family and friends lined up and down the steps tossing rice as bulbs flashed and the wedding album would hold my cherished memories. But I didn’t want any of that.  	“No,” I said. Mama coughed out a sob and again Daddy said, “You’ll marry him.” He said it like he believed I’d not really heard him the first time, or if I did, that I’d simply misunderstood him. He only wanted the best for me, his baby girl, his only child, I knew that.  	“No,” I said again. “Why should I, when he’ll marry me and then go get killed  in that war? When the last thing I want to do is be a housewife?”  	My mother slammed the steel masher against the bowl with a quick, sharp stroke. “I’ve had a very fulfilling life as a housewife, Lily Ann Roth.”  	But I knew she hadn’t. And for the first time, I said so. “How fulfilling was it when you told me you only married him because you didn’t know you could do anything else? Or when he comes home from his precious country club, drunk as everything, and beats you for no reason?”  	You’d have thought I was the one who’d beaten her. The look of hurt on her porcelain face, her faded blonde curls unmoving, her mouth open and silent.  	But still I pressed on. I yelled about the talent she’d wasted, the voice she put on the shelf when Daddy married her. The choir teaching job she turned down because she was afraid of what people would think in high Athens society. Then I yelled about anything else I could think of: why she made me cheer when I didn’t want to, why she rolled my hair even when I told her a bob would be better, why she broke her back cleaning a house that was way too big for the three of us but Daddy bought because it was what people did and obviously we couldn’t do anything other than what people did.   	“Goddammit, Lily!” My father’s roar was followed by the unmistakable chk-chick of his double-barrel shotgun.  	When I turned around, the twin barrels were aimed right at me. It felt like the entire kitchen had come to life and was watching: The copper plaque on the wall bearing “As for me and my house, we shall serve the Lord;” the ceramic corn-shaped salt-and-pepper shakers on the worn wooden table; the pristine white of the refrigerator.   	Daddy’s grip on the gun was steady, trained by decades of deer hunting in the mountains of Georgia. I smelled the  bourbon then, surprised I’d not smelled it earlier. The whiff told me he’d been drinking since at least lunchtime, when his law firm stopped working and became the good old boys hang-out for the rest of the day. The bourbon seeped out of his skin and rested in droplets on his balding head. His brown eyes were wild and quivered from side to side, but his grip on the gun remained firm.  	I understood the deer then, his instinct first to stand utterly still in a frantic last chance at life, then his eyes blink and he thinks No and bolts, quickly, but not quickly enough. I froze, but instantly knew he was serious and ducked.  	He pulled the trigger.                My mother’s instant terrified screams made me stand up and look.   	The blood seemed to be everywhere, pooling out of her back onto the black and white Formica of the floor, gushing out of her chest and turning her apron the darkest red. I screamed and grabbed a dishtowel to press against her heaving chest, and prayed to God that I could save her. “No Mama no you can’t leave me like this!” I yelled. I pressed harder onto her chest, knowing it was useless, knowing more blood was rushing out of her back than I could ever hope to stop.   	She locked eyes with me, then opened her mouth. “Oh, my,” she said. She heaved a breath and was gone. It was so quick, so fast, that I thought there was no way it could have just happened.  	Above us stood my father, his face almost a caricature of itself the way it tore into horror, unable to process what he’d done. There he was, the man who’d washed my hair and tickled my toes, the one who, despite everything, I loved. And he had killed my mother instead of me.   	I remember the smell of blood and gunpowder. The way my cuticles soaked up the red and refused to wash out. The look in my mother’s eyes when she realized she was going to die.  	My father and I didn’t speak a word to each other – I simply put my head on my mother’s shoulder and laid down with her, and he walked out of the kitchen. When the police came, they  found me on the floor with my mother, both our dresses ruined from the blood. My father was sitting on the porch steps, his gun resting on his legs, waiting on them.   	He was taken to jail never let out, even though he wouldn’t have gone anywhere anyway. He was a crushed shell, an oak tree hollowed by termites. I saw him after the burial and told him she was in the plot he’d bought for her when they got married. That was the kind of man he was – he bought burial plots as a wedding gift and life insurance (for him only) in celebration of my birth. A pragmatic man.  	I couldn’t find anything to say to him after giving him the details of Mom’s burial. We sat on opposite sides of a wooden table, a guard standing ten feet away. He looked horrible even though he was clean-shaven. Dark blue circles swam underneath his eyes, and his hands shook continuously from lack of liquor.  	While I sat there and looked at my hands, cracked and red from the bleach I used to clean my mother’s blood from the kitchen, he talked.  	“Sweetie, Lily, you know how sorry I am. You know it was an accident. I didn’t know what I was doing. Can you forgive me?” He swallowed, twice, before I could even look into his eyes. They twitched from left to right, seeming to search my face for any clue for how to act.  	But I gave him nothing. He was my father, and I’d been raised to respect him, but if I hadn’t ducked it would be me in the ground and my mother sitting there being asked for forgiveness.  	He spoke again. “What are your plans, then?”  	I thought about it. “I don’t know. Right now I’m,” I paused, “cleaning up your mess.” Literally.  	His eyes clicked into place then, having found something to talk about. So I sat there while he rattled off a to-do list for me. Who to call about electricity, house payments, his country club membership.  	When he finished he nodded to the guard and stood up. Suddenly he seemed to want out of there as much as I did. He stepped towards me, I guess for a hug or kiss or any kind of reassuring touch, but I flinched and stepped back.   	I didn’t have any family left – both my parents were only children and my grandparents were long dead. So I went home to my best friend Rose’s house, the DeWalt’s, where I sat down to a normal dinner of meatloaf, mashed potatoes, peas, and peach cobbler for dessert. I was surrounded by a normal family: mother and father, daughter Rose, son Richard Junior, second son Matthew, dog and cat slinking through legs begging for scraps. No wonder, then, that I decided to leave Athens.

      Every story begins on the way somewhere. Between where you are going and where you were.&nbsp; Sometimes you’re on the road, driving.&nbsp; Maybe because driving is therapeutic.&nbsp; When you are driving, you have time to think, time to reflect.&nbsp; It’s when you talk to yourself, or you talk to your companion, the road.&nbsp; There are times when I like to driving in complete silence, just the sound of the engine and the tires on the highway.&nbsp; Other times, I need music.&nbsp; Loud music that I can sing to at the top of my lungs; because I am angry or full of some exuberant emotion.&nbsp; Then, there are the times when I’m sad, and it’s hard to see the road through my tears.&nbsp; Driving is perfect for when I’m sad, and I want to escape or go somewhere that I feel safe.&nbsp; Just me and the road. &nbsp;And I love my car, because it takes me there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I bought a new car a few months ago.&nbsp; I drove away from the car lot singing, “I got a new car, I got a new car…”&nbsp; I sang that song for miles.&nbsp; For days.&nbsp; I still thank God a few times a week for that car, even though I’m not entirely sure what kind of terms He/She and I are on these days.&nbsp; Me and the road have a new vehicle for going places, and we love going places.&nbsp; New places.&nbsp; Old places.&nbsp; I prefer driving fast on smooth pavement, but I’m very understanding of occasional potholes and dirt roads.&nbsp; Nobody’s perfect, and after all, variety is supposed to add spice to life.&nbsp; It may even add character.&nbsp; That’s another reason the road and I get along so well.&nbsp; There is no judgment here.&nbsp; I don’t have to be anyone but me.&nbsp; My occasional tears don’t embarrass the road, and it doesn’t flinch when I yell out, “Fuck you, Motherfucker!” at the car that just cut me off.   My windows are down today.&nbsp; The wind is blowing my hair all over the place, a few strands keep getting in my face, but I like them there.&nbsp; I am leaving the parking lot of the bookstore.&nbsp; An hour and a half in there, and I walked out bored and empty handed.&nbsp; Hundreds of books, and nothing I feel like reading.&nbsp; I guess you just have to be in the right mood.&nbsp; Besides, lately, there probably isn’t enough room in my head for imagining someone else’s world.&nbsp; Mine is taking up too much space.&nbsp; I fight the urge to throw my head back and close my eyes, as I take a deep, cleansing breath.&nbsp; Mmm, that felt good.&nbsp; I turn up the car stereo.&nbsp; I love this song.&nbsp; I wonder for a minute what people think when they pass by and see me completely lost in the music.&nbsp; I love driving like this, it’s invigorating.&nbsp; Some people start their day with a cup of coffee or the newspaper and cigarette.&nbsp; All I need is the road.&nbsp; Me and the road.   I think it makes sense that my story begins on the road.&nbsp; I have spent more time there than anywhere. There are always those typical&nbsp;questions people love to ask, when they first meet you.&nbsp; First, it’s, “What your name?” and then, “So, where are you from?” I know that no one really wants an essay answer, so I typically, reply with something like, “Oh, everywhere…” Well, maybe I should just start saying that I grew up on the road.&nbsp; Yeah, that’s where I’m from.&nbsp; I’m a gypsy, a nomad.&nbsp; It’s kind of exciting and intriguing.&nbsp; After all, that is where I go when I feel like I don’t really know where I belong.&nbsp; So, I’ll begin my story with the only place that feels like home.

      Saturday morning, an unhappy Cara crawled into bed with me, "Mommy, I had a bad dream..."  With her growing vocabulary, her descriptions of her dreams is getting really interesting.  She crawled up in bed with me, I listened and reassured her that it was just a dream, and she fell back to sleep.  Well, some sort of strange role reversal must have happened.  Cara's dream had been full of bad guys and good guys, dialogue and even jail cells.  Then, I closed my eyes and came face to face with a monster.  Your classic running from the long snouted, snarling, horned, monster dream.  Quite typically, at the climactic moment, I jumped and woke myself up.  Cara rolled over, ready to talk again, and it was my turn to share a bad dream.  There we were, 8:00 in the morning, talking about our nightmares.  But there was no, "Don't worry, mommy, it's not real."  No reassurances or distractions from thinking about it.  She wanted to know what happened next. Did the monster eat her and Adia? Did I kill the monster? Maybe there were other monsters with him?    What happened next was that I woke up and realized I had been dreaming.  It was all just a bad dream.  Reality was snuggled up next to me, with her head on my shoulder and so much stronger than the monsters beneath my bed.   (forgive the Indigo Girl's lyric theft)

      My yawning is out of control this week.  I’ve decided that either I’m not getting enough oxygen, or I’m not getting enough sleep.  I do need to get back into my regular practice of yoga – with the deep abdominal breathing, but the lack of sleep is probably more likely to be the culprit.  How many 3 and 4 year olds do you know that still take 3 hour naps?  My children do.  They are smart strategists.  Since I have gone back to work, they have figured out that the only time they really get to spend with me is in the evenings.  So, they sleep all afternoon, knowing that if they wake up at 5:30, I am not likely to force them into bed a mere 2 ½ hours later.  Even on those nights when I feel desperately exhausted, and I encourage them to run laps around the coffee table, the schedule stays the same.  By the time we have completed or lengthy bedtime ritual, including whatever new excuses they have come up with to stall the process, it is after 10:00.  There are still dishes to be washed, clothes folded and put away, toys cluttering the floor, bills to be paid, and that relaxing, alone time I have been craving all day.  Sleep has fallen the bottom of my priority list.  There is not enough time for sleep anymore.  (YAWN) There I go again...

      Ok, so maybe giving your kids coffee ice cream before bed is not such a good idea.  In an attempt to quit drinking coffee, I have been buying coffee ice cream to treat myself for such firm resolve.  (No, I don't want to know how close it is to the real thing.  To me, it's not coffee, it's ice cream.)  Of course, I couldn't hide it from the girls.  They haven't touched the chocolate ice cream since.  And now I"m wondering if it's a sign that they are going to be future coffee drinkers (with lots of cream and sugar - just like mommy) when they like to wait until the ice cream is completely melted and room temperature before eating it?    We watched "Breakfast at Tiffany's" last night.  It seemed somehow appropriate, the decadence of drippy, melting, coffee ice cream, while watching Audrey Hepburn munch pastries outside of Tiffany's.  Bedtime could wait.  Then, after the movie, after the effects of the coffee ice cream had worn off, two sleepy little girls crawled into bed, the strains of "Moon River" still floating in their heads.

      "Mommy I want a baby brother," Cara said to me last night.    We were sitting around the table eating dinner, or trying to at least.  Instead of eating, the girls were distract me with every topic of conversation possible.  Well, Cara was.  Adia was just making silly noises and faces to make me laugh.  Eventually, they brought up the usual, "Mommy, why aren't you and Daddy married anymore?"   "But, I want you to be together," Adia protested. "You don't have to fight."    It's a reoccuring discussion we have about once a week.  It is not even that they like us in the same room together.  Sunday, when Drew dropped the kids off, they practically herded him out the door.  And, they actually really like my boyfriend.  They think he's great and talk about him all the time (which I'm sure their Dad loves).  There are no tears about it anymore, but now that they can carry on a conversation, they want to know about everything.  As much as they have adjusted to going back and forth every week, they understandably would prefer if they could have both of their parents under one roof at the same time.  In addition to that, they are also entering the "Why" stage.       I will say that last night, I think I came up with one of my best illustrative explanations yet.  I asked them to think about the puzzles that they play with, and how sometimes, some of the pieces fit together and others don't.  I told them that their Dad and I were like 2 puzzle pieces that you tried to put together, but they didn't fit.  Then they asked me who I was going to marry next, when I was getting married again.  I tried to impress upon them the importance of being careful, being sure about who you plan to marry.  Not rushing and making a mistake, like I did before.  Although, I made sure they knew they were not a mistake.  That no matter what happened, even if me and Daddy didn't love each other anymore, we would always love them.  That seemed to be enough for them, for the time being.     Cara smiled and said, "Well, when I'm 5, you can get married to somebody else and have a baby brother for me."    Adia chimed in, "And one for me too!"  When she is 5, Cara is going to be able to do everything.  When she is 5, she is going to be an artist.  When she turns 5, She is going to marry Cole (her "boyfriend").  After all, 5 years old is all grown up.  Thankfully, after that, she dropped the baby brother bit.  Then, it was back to complaining about how she didn't want to eat the food on her plate...

      “There is no such thing as magic,” I found myself telling my 4 year old, Cara, on the way home from a movie tonight. Of course, all of this needs to be put into context.   I had taken them to see a fairy-tale type movie - complete with princesses, ogres, elves, and (of course) magic. On the way home, Cara started doing her push-mommy’s-buttons-guilt-trip thing, which quickly (as she knew it would) cast a shadow over what had otherwise been an enjoyable evening. I think it must be a control thing. Oh, yeah, and maybe she’s a little mad at me for no longer being married to her dad… But, that is another issue entirely.   We had just been talking about the non-existence of monsters with her younger sister, Adia (who is 3 years old). Ok, so I was still a little disgruntled, and admittedly, hurt (sometimes it’s just too damn hard to be the grown-up and pretend nothing touches you). I was trying to convince Adia that there were no such thing as monsters.   “Monsters are just pretend,” I insisted, with the occasional, “Yeah” thrown in from the peanut gallery.   Then, Cara interjected, “Mommy, why is there magic in my blanket?” And, that was where this all started...   I remember when I was pregnant with Cara, I bought two of the thickest books I could find, just FULL of fairy tales. I emphasized to Drew (the now ex-husband) the importance of an open and imaginative mind. Of course, I was still full of hopes and ideals. I was going to find out how to be the BEST mom ever. I would do everything in my power to ensure I gave birth to the most brilliant and healthy children, and I would give them the most diversely well-rounded environment. Tack onto that a few other unrealistically ideal expectations, and anyone could see I was headed for mountains of disappointment. My children actually have been perfect - perfectly beautiful, exceptionally intelligent and intuitive, and full of good health. It is me, myself, who turned out to be the disappointment. No big surprise, but also an entirely different issue.  Ok, back to magic. Monsters... Magic... Blankets? Yes, magical blankets. That one came back to bite me.   It all started when I went back to work. Cara started “acting out” (as THEY call it). Besides being completely uncooperative, she did not want to sleep in her bed at night, and certainly not alone. One of her favorite lines was, “I’m scared when I'm sleeping. I’m scared of my bed.” So, I had the brilliant idea to tell her that there was magic in her blanket, thinking that it would foster a safe feeling – like, mommy set this blanket to watch over you, always (mm-hmm, even she didn’t buy it). While pregnant with Adia, I had helped my mom sew Cara a quilt to ease her move to a big girl bed. I explained this to her, and I told her that we had sewn the blanket with love and put magic in it to keep her safe. Cara finds a way to disagree with everything or create a complication to it. After that, I often heard her say that the magic in her blanket was bothering her, and she created a whole new set of excuses for not sleeping in her bed, based on that.   Lesson 1: magic is not always good.   Now, returning to being in the car and on the way home from the movie. Cara is being disagreeable. I am feeling injured. We establish and agree together that there are no monsters anywhere, not for real. Then, she asks about the magic in her blanket. I explained the reason again.   “Well, I don’t want a magic blanket,” she declares.   “Ok,” I tell her, exasperated, “there is no such thing as magic. I just meant that the love we put into that blanket can make you feel safe. Magic isn’t real. Monster’s aren’t real. It’s just all pretend!”  (And... BAM!!! Right into that glass bubble of innocence. Big Mommy points for that one.)  We turn the corner. We are nearly home. I am gritting my teeth, willing her not to say one more negative thing. I’m afraid of what else I might say. Luckily, although they always seem to be listening when I wish they wouldn't, they are not really paying attention to me right now. Cara has already moved on to the next thing.   “I don’t want love to be in my blanket,” she mutters.  I sigh with exasperation and tell her, “Cara, that's all there is. Love is the only thing there is that is good in this world, the only magic.” Wondering to myself, as I say these words, how much of their love I have lost.   So, here I am, bereft of personal dreams and full of compromised ideals, trying to grow in my children what I lack. But, I think, or I now realize, that they already have it. And in forcing them to hold onto it, to consciously think of it, rather than be as children naturally are, I could very well crush it. That was the warning that came screaming out at me tonight.   Lesson 2: Let not your bitterness dirty the water of someone else’s well.   Putting the girls to bed, they asked me for the song I always sing to them, “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” I sang so softly, tonight, barely able to get through the words.   “…if happy, little bluebirds fly above the rainbow, why, oh why, can’t I?”

      There is this song that Tori Amos sings called, "I Don't Like Mondays."  I love that song. I hate Mondays.  As she sings, "I wanna shoot the whole day down, down, down, shoot it all down..."  Today it’s Monday, and all of yesterday and today came together in a big blur.  I wish I could wipe the day clean and start over again, then I could be prepared for everything that went awry, that just slipped off track.    Sunday night, I got the girls back from their Dad’s house.  Note to self: Never offer to pick the kids up from Drew’s place again. As tortuous as Cara’s tearful and resentful goodbye is to her Dad when he drops them off, it is that much worse pulling her away from his house and enduring the 15-20 minute ride home.  I felt like a terrible person, taking the poor child away from her father. At the same time, I am deeply injured by the idea that she could love him more than – or even as much as – me.  After all, I keep thinking, he didn’t give birth to her.  He didn’t house her in his body for over 9 months, and then push her out into the world using every ounce of strength in his body.  When did milk ever flow from his breasts to sustain life? (and, for a moment, I feel almost goddess like when I think of women this way – with the ability to house and sustain life…)  Does that mean nothing anymore?   After an exhausting evening of appeasing my Mommy-guilt by trying to make up for every minute, hour, day, and night I have to spend away from them, I stay up nearly the entire evening working on a project for work.  After cleaning the kitchen.  After putting the clothes away.  After taking a rushed shower and deciding that, once again, I do not have enough time to shave my legs. There is not time to complete the day, before the next one begins.  So, today, I am still trying to finish with yesterday and nothing is going right.  Loose ends, losing ends, losing it.   No, I don’t like Mondays.

      I think that the moment children are born, there is fused an invisible chord that connects their mother to them.  We are bound by that, eternally, but it can be damaged. It can be severed. A child can twist it, tug and pull on it, break it, or even rip your heart out with it. Maybe I am being a little dramatic, but it really feels that way sometimes. At four years old, my oldest daughter has already learned how to manipulate. Like a puppet, she jerks my heart around on a string.   My mom, who just came into town, pointed that out to me the other night. Cara was working herself into her usual obstinate “I refusal to cooperate in any way, shape, or form” frenzy, when my Mom turned accusingly to me. “What has happened to you, you didn’t used to be like this?! Take control of your child, take control of your life,” she threw out at me. I threw my hands up, frustrated and resigned, and she took over for me.  She knows that since I hardly see the girls anymore, I hate to be the bad guy during the few hours I have with them at night. “I just don’t know what’s wrong with you. When you are here, you’re not really here. You’re not really anywhere…” she told me.    I could not really disagree with her.  I felt that way, spread so thin that I am never really entirely present in any part of my life.  As a divorced single parent, you have to play every role.  Not only are you still responsible for all the things you did before, but the entire other half of things are now also needing your attention.  I am comforted by the knowledge that at least I have a family to give me some emotionally support, and I can take the criticisms and everything else that comes with that.  I cannot imagine how difficult it is for single-mothers who are truly alone.  At least my ex-husband is not a “dead beat dad,” and he actually is an involved father, although I sometime resent it more than I appreciate it.  But, I am here.  If it sometimes doesn’t seem like it, it’s because I am trying to figure all of this out and still find time to eat, sleep, and breathe.

      I can’t believe I’ve had children with this man, I thought to myself as we walked down the sidewalk. The four of us, nearly a family, except that we weren’t.  We had actually just signed and filed the divorce papers a few weeks ago.  I watched the top of Adia’s curly head and looked at Cara’s newly painted toenails poking of her sandals, while I pretend to listen to their father. Drew was talking animatedly about some new idea for a show he planned to pitch to a local radio station. He was always excited about something new. I tried not to let that thought lead me into bitter territory. I had promised myself I would not be angry today. I had wanted to see the kids, so I had determined to endure his irritating conversation for an hour.  At least he had been accommodating enough to bring them to me on my lunch break, even though it was the start of his weekend with them.  The girls were subdued, and I wondered how they must feel when they are with the two of us.  It was obvious that there was nothing left between us, nothing but our children, and I wondered again at how I had ever had the desire to have a family with this man.  Then, I felt Adia’s soft little hand in mine, and I quieted the thought. I couldn’t imagine a world without them in it.   The downtown library was just across the street from the building I worked in.  We walked in the double doors, and there were moms and children everywhere. Pushing strollers with sandals on, reminding me that I was not part of that world anymore.  I tugged self-consciously at my suit jack and slipped it off my shoulders.  I work full time now and mommy on the side.  I am not sure if I will ever be able to reconcile myself with the guilt I feel at leaving my kids every day, especially since they also spend weekends away at their dad’s house.  I miss our mornings together, snuggling on the couch, drinking chocolate milk and watching “The Wiggles.” I miss lunches on the back porch and trips to the park.  Washing sticky fingers and kissing boo-boos.  I am not even sure how much Adia weighs now or how many inches Cara has grown, but every week they seem to outgrow something else.  That reminded me, I still needed to get that basket of their clean clothes put away.  I am just always so tired when I get home, and dinner needs to be made, the girls fed and bathed. Dishes need to be washed, and toys put away... There is just not enough time anymore.

      We are getting ready to take a road trip.  Nashville to Maine, to spend our vacation with my boyfriend’s family.  They do this every year, but I think he usually flies up there.  I keep warning him that it won’t be like the other trips he and I have taken together, since Cara and Adiaare also coming.  Traveling with a three year old and four year old is going to b e new experience for him.  Especially since up until recently he was the quintessential bachelor.  Though he gets an uncertain look in his eyes, when I remind him of this, he is quick to reassure me (and himself) that it will be fun.  I think he is remembering what it was like to travel, as a child, and still views things from that perspective.  Still, I hope he's right.  I hope it is fun.  I remember being young and taking long trips with my family.  My sister and I would sit, cramped with all the baggage, in the backseat.  It seems like we always had so much stuff.  For a while, we would argue and push each other off our “side” of the seat.  Then, after hours, or maybe even days, of being trapped in such a small space together, we would reach a point of extreme silliness.  We would sing songs, loudly and intentionally off-key, throw toys or food, twist our bodies sideways and upside down, and drive my parents crazy with our screeching and laughing.  Initially, they would be amused and relieved that we were no longer fighting.  Mostly, though, I remember that they looked tired.  Sometimes, my mom would sigh out of sheer exhaustion. This was about the time she would start nagging my dad about his driving, telling him to watch the road and stop messing with the stereo.  Music was his escape on those road trips, while my mom simply craved a little peace and quiet.  So, she was thrilled when I discovered my love for reading, and that driving and reading did not make me car sick.    Despite all the chaos, we were fine, and this must be the part that my boyfriend remembers.  Only, this time, he gets to join me in the role of exhausted parent.  We will do all we can to ensure that the trip is bearable for the children, to spare not just their suffering, but also our own.  In the end, though, it all just makes you tired, and the arrival at the destination is that much sweeter for having survived the road getting there.

      I woke up today, and everything was different. The world around me looks the same, but it feels different. It's almost as though I have spent my life - up to this point - looking through a smudged window, that has grown dirtier every year. I've windexed the inside a thousand times, but I can only get this one side clean. Then, somebody comes along on the outside, wipes their hand across the middle of the glass and says, "Now, look."

      I love the people who will say anything.  Like the receptionist at this office.  She's one of those people with whom no topic is off limits for discussion.  I remember one day when she drew a little picture of her childhood pet -- a hamster with oversized balls.  I have rarely laughed that hard.  Then, today, somehow we got on the topic of the difference between how much time men and women take on the toilet.  And then onto toilet paper use.  Next thing I knew, we were discussing her wiping techniques.  Out came the pen and the little piece of paper for a diagram.  When was the last time someone drew a diagram of how they wipe their ass for you?  Oh, it was funny.

      Somebody gave me a little American flag today, I picked it up, looked at it, and felt nothing.  No, actually, that's not true. I did feel something.    I felt like the colors were too bright and the pattern too busy.  Too many stripes and too many stars.  I felt tired of seeing it everywhere, and as we draw closer to July 4th, that is bound to increase.  I guess I am thankful that I am a citizen of a country that has economic strength and social freedom.  But, I am not proud of it.  More often than not, I am embarrassed.   But, then, I am a woman without a country.  I have spent more time, total, living in other countries than I have in my own.  In the Philippines, the kids used to run up to me and yell, "Hey, Joe!"  What they remembered was the American G.I.'s who helped them win political freedom.  Then, we designed their government to be just like ours, and to this day, it still doesn't work.  In Europe, America is an embarrassment, just a baby.  To Eastern Europe, America is the land of milk and honey.  In Russia, they love America for movies and Coca-Cola, for rock music, freedom.  America the land of strength and stupidity.  When was that last time that we could look at the figurehead, the leader of our nation, and know that he was respected across the ocean.  How far back do we have to go, before they were bumbling idiots, with a Cheshire cat grin and so much to make fun of on SNL.  I hate our political structure and foreign politics.    But I like the idea of our country, my country, which I guess it is.  I like the ideas of the forefather's of this nation.  The Declaration of Independence.  Memorizing the Preamble to the Constitution.  Growing up outside of my country, those were the things I was proud of, those words, those ideas.  That was my America.  Those are the things I still remember.  I was taught that we are supposed to have a government, "Of the people, by the people, and for the people."  That "all men are created equal... with certain, unalienable rights... life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."    Or how about this: "Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  I guess I'm just disappointed, and I don't really like the American flag - for purely aesthetic reasons.

      In the office kitchen today, the smell of food was heavy in the air.  But it didn't smell like real food, not a mouth watering, appetizing smell.  Still, it was a familiar scent.  Not just because I smell it everyday, but something about that smell tickles at the corner of my brain, in a memory.  I couldn't quite place it, at first, then it hit me.  Like coming out of a hypnotic state, when the bell chimes.  The microwave beeped  to announce that another frozen dinner was ready to be eaten.  At that moment, the scent and the memory collided.  Airplane food.  Frozen dinners taste and smell just like airlplane food.  I mean, that is basically what the food is that you get on an airplane.  Food that has been frozen and then defrosted until it is really, really hot, burning the tips of your fingers as you work the tinfoil off the top.    Now, why would you want to eat that stuff at any other time?  I mean, we eat airplane food, because, after 8 hours of flying you are hungry enough to eat anything.  It's not as though you have anything better to do, trapped in a too small seat, listening to the breathing of the other people pressed in around you, and watching reruns of CNN on the tiny TV screen.  What I don't understand is why you would ever go to the grocery store, and buy packages of Lean Cuisine, Healthy Choice, Stouffers, or whatever happens to be your preferred brand of frozen, pre-prepared food.    I am sympathetic to the monotony of making your own lunch and the expenses of take-out for the nine to fiver.  Don't get me wrong. But, let's leave airplane food to be eaten only when you're in the sky.

      Pop-up adds on the internet are the biggest pain in the ass.  There you are, just trying to read or get something else accomplished, and then suddenly, POP! a little box jumps onto your computer screen and screams, LOOK AT ME, LOOKE AT ME, LOOK AT ME.  Let me guess, I'm the 1,263,452,301 visitor to this sight and that means I win something?  Great.  Now all I have to do is click on this button and read this add, oh, and fill in this survey... What's that?  There's another page of special offers I just have to see? Ok, well, I mean if I just have to look for a minute.  A free I-Pod would be cool.  Yeah, "free". And the boxes open one, after the other, until finally they ask for your credit card number. Hmmm, now why would they need a credit card number if it is free?  Oh, and hopefully you didn't put your real email address in all those little forms and surveys you filled out... because the next time you check email, you will have 10 messages from God knows where with more "free" offers and "great deals".  So, now it's an hour later, and I can't remember what I was doing before all this started. In the last hour, I think I entered a poetry contest... I might be getting some coupons in the mail for chocolate chips... that vacation offer was kind of tempting... but I stopped myself before I slid all the way down the slippery slope of free offers.  Man, they ask for my credit card number, and I have to draw the line. So, no free IPod today.  Bummer.

      I'm just a little raincloud Floating over your bright parade But I'm read to explode And flood these city streets  Only sharpening my claws Beneath the smile on my face But my fur is silky soft And my look is innocence

      If you could go back and change anything about your life, what would it be?  If we are the sum of our many experiences, then changing something about my past could change who it is I have become.  It could alter other decisions I made after that, setting off a different chain of events.  If that happened, where and who would I be right now?   I close my eyes, and I can picture myself somewhere else...  I am sitting in a dark corner of a dusty cafe, somewhere in the Middle East, travel worn and nearly unrecognizable.  With my dyed skin and a veil over my face, I have seen things few other have.  Pen in hand, I am scribbling down ideas for my next article...  I am on stage, and the roar of the crowd is nearly deafening.  Sweat dampens the back of my shirt and the microphone is a little slippery in my hand.  The music surrounds me and I begin to sing, feeling that soaring, heady freedom.  I can barely hear myself over the people singing every word to my songs...  A mosquito buzzes in my ear, and I swat at it.  A voice calls out to me in a language not my own, but I understand it and reply in the same.  I am unpacking medical supplies from the back of a large truck, the African sun beating down on my back.  Water is in short supply this year, but with our help, the natives will make it through the drought this year.  Sometimes I miss the cool fall and winter seasons we had in the States, but the work is so rewarding - saving hundreds of lives from starvation and disease every week...  I hear little laughing voices come from down the hall. “It’s almost time for dinner,” I call out.   “Ok, mommy,” they answer. “Would you go tell Daddy to hurry up?”  I turn of the stove and turn to set the table for four.  It’s so nice now that we can all sit together and there are no more messy high chairs to clean up.  The girls come running into the room.  “Daddy’s almost finished with our tree house!” they excitedly announce together.   I nod and smile, thankful that he was willing to do this on his day off, even though I am always home.  The girls will both be in school this fall, though, and I am thinking I might go back to work part-time...  Then, I open my eyes, and I am still sitting here in front of the computer screen.  It’s lunch time, and the office has cleared a little bit.  I have a grocery list in front of me, trying to figure out what to make for dinner.  I am hoping the kids have a good nap today, so that our few hours together tonight are pleasant.  Traffic was so bad coming into work this morning, I hope it is better tonight.  I wonder if I will have time to sit down and work on those songs tonight, but probably not.  The evening will doubtless end with me washing the dishes and finishing the laundry.  I think I’ll pick up a bottle of wine to keep me company, and maybe something good will be on TV...

      Let's talk for a moment about breastfeeding.  What are my qualifications, you ask?  I'm a mom.  I have breastfed 2 children, and if I ever have any more children, I look forward to the opportunity of doing it again in the future.  The benefits are countless.    1) Breastfeeding aids in the prevention of breast cancer.  2) It is scientifically proven to be better for children, both for it's physical nutritional value and contribution to healthy brain development.    3) Antibodies (see #2)  4) Mother and child bonding (once you get through the initial pain - cracked and  bleeding nipples, the possibility of public boob exposure, and the occasional biting - once teething begins...)  5) Prevention of allergies (see #2)  6) Less diaper bag paraphernalia (like bottles and formula)  7) More constructive use of time (instead of needing to purchase bottles and sterilize them, heating water, mixing formula and water - usually resulting in some sort of mess)  8) Economical (booby milk is cheap)  Need I say more?  To all those macho feminist who don't want babies, I argue that giving birth and breastfeeding is extremely empowering.  How could it not be?! Only a woman has the ability to create and sustain life with and within her body.  Well, ok, we can't create completely alone. We do need that sperm from you guys, but we do all the work.  Not to mention, physical scars.   I recently went bathingsuit shopping.  Not fun, when you have stretch marks.  Especially if you are partial to 2 piece bathing suits, and honestly, most stores don't carry a large variety of cute one pieces.  I have a virtual road map of stretch marks lining my abdomen.  My daughters ask me all the time, "Mommy, why do you have scratches on your tummy?"  I very gently remind them, even to the point of pulling out pictures of me pregnant, that they are from them.  Not in a blaming sort of way, more like a reminder of what I was willing to go through because of my love for them.  "It's squishy, Mommy!"  And I love them for it.    No matter what anyone says or what products claim to be able to do, stretch marks are genetic.  Bottom line: if your mom has them, then you are likely to as well.  I was prepared for mine, but I still fought them like hell.  For 9 months, my bathroom constantly smelled of cocoa butter and other products that promised to "prevent stretch marks".  Nevertheless, around 6 1/2 months into the pregnancy, my tummy started to itch, and then these little spots appeared.  It was kind of strange to watch them gradually progress, as my stomach grew, from round marks to long jagged lines as my stomach grew.  It wasn't like I was huge.  I only gained about 35 lbs with each of my pregnancies (by the way, I think that Kate Hudson reportedly gained 70+ lbs. with her pregnancy).  So, I embraced my "battle scars."  After Cara (my oldest) was born and my body started to recover, I was relieved when I realized that the stretch marks just fell short of coming out of the top of my bikini bottoms.  A few months later, even before my hair had stopped falling out (another fun post-pregnancy thing), I found out I was going to be having another baby.  I had already lost more than my pregnancy weight, and I thought that my stretch marks couldn't get any worse...   The other day, I showed Cara which stetch marks were from her (all of them), and then I turned to Adia (my youngest) and told her, "See up here, the top inch of all of these is from you."  Being a mother of two has stretched me farther - in more ways than one, sometimes farther than I think I am able to go.  The girls seem almost proud to own the responsibility for my stetch marks, and so I think I can bear them unabashedly.  I bought a new bathing suit the other day.  A 2 piece.  I will show the world that I am empowered, and I hope I can do my part to empower the next generation of women.

      I am just appalled.  What kind of idiots are running this country?  How is that the President and his advisors are forever uninformed or misinformed?  It reeks of deception or extreme stupidity.  This week the media stuns us with pictures of the brutal treatment some of the members of our army have inflicted on prisoners in the Middle East.  I thank the media. For all of it’s faults, were it not for them, many injustices would be allowed to continue.    oh, but the President and Defense minister didn’t know about it…  Of course, they found out only just before we did.  Well, maybe they didn’t, but I find that possibility (besides being a bit hard to swallow) even more appalling.  It is sounds too much like September 11th, and so many other incidences, where the President was once again “uninformed.”  I want to know why he doesn’t have spies.  And, if he does have spies, they should be fired for their complete incompetence.  The Secret Service is a misnomer.  Nothing secretive about the services they perform.  What else do they do besides protect the physical safety of the President and talk on those little black headsets?  I would almost feel safer if there were more secrets.  If the President knew more than we knew, if he was more capable than anyone else.  Why can’t Superman be the President?    We long to be inspired.  We crave a Presidential Candidate in whom we can be confident that the running of this country is a top priority.  No more popularity contests.  No more greed.  No more celebrity politicians.   HELP WANTED: SERVANT AND MANAGER FOR A LARGE NATION.  MUST BE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT AND EXTREMELY HUMBLE.  IF INTERESTED, PLEASE CALL ME.  –CONCERNED AMERICAN CITIZEN
