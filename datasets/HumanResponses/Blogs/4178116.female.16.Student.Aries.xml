       Well I'm back in town. Didja miss me? I have a few pictures, but not a whole lot. It was really gloomy and dark on Saturday but Sunday was bright and filled with sunshine. I got to see my brother play ultimate Frisbee and it was pretty cool. It's a blend of football and Frisbee, as far as I could tell. Well I have to go but I have lots more to say.

       Well before I say good night, I have had a few new happenings since this mornings entry. My cousins who I love so much, visited my house today. They had to scan some pictures for their aunts slideshow, for her birthday. We are supposed to go to lunch on Friday because that's the last time we will be together for a long time. My cousin Justin is going off to college and he leaves the  15th , but I will be in San Francisco so I won't be able to see him off. He will be back for Christmas, but that is so far away. I am kinda tired so I will write some more tomorrow.

       I know not many people know about my blog yet, but some of you may now know that Befrank is my dad and you like to see what he has to say.   I wanted people to read my blog, not because you knew of him or because he asked you to take a look, I wanted to write my true feeling concerning my life and life itself. It's really cool to be able to express myself in a constructive way, but if you don't think I'm interesting that's okay, I just want to write about what I know, not about who I know.

       It's a brand new day open for adventure and new beginnings or just rolling out of bed and taking a shower. It's a fresh day so you should be fresh yourself. I will begin apply for college soon. I'm scared by the fact that I will soon be leaving home, but I'm excited to see what the world has to offer. You never really know until you're on your own. I plan on applying to Hawaii Pacific as my first choice. I still have my doubts about leaving home, but then I think about all the new and creative ways I have to reinvent myself in a new environment. I really do hope I can get into HPU. Well until later in the day, I bid you all farewell.

       The feeling of nothing is Being alone in a room, Not knowing what's going to happen next, What life is like after death, wondering Why we struggle to stay alive, and then die.  The feeling of nothing is Thinking about why you exist, Daydreaming about if nobody ever existed what would happen, and Trying to deal with life knowing you will die.  When I think of nothingness, I think about the fact that We are alive for a certain number of years, We struggle with society to stay alive, and Then when we are on top of the world we die. We have everything we could possibly need, but What happens to that when we leave? Do we disappear into a pit of despair and nothingness, or Do we reincarnate into something we would hate to become. Do we go onto the "other side", or Do we stay in between the real and the fake.  Having to experience life is in itself the true feeling of nothingness.

       Well the day is slowly going by, I think I'm going to scream. The only thing keeping me from doing so is the softball game on ESPN. I can't wait till friday I will be taking a trip to visit my brother. I will hopefully have a lot of pictures from my trip. I am being distracted by the sports on my TV so I will write again shortly.

       So I found a couple of funny pictures on my computer. From time to time this may happen, because I think people need to laugh every once in a while.

       Well it's a brand new day yet it is still summer, me without a job, and no softball practice to go to. I don't start school for another two whole weeks. I kinda wish summer was over, but I really don't wanna go back to my school. I didn't really wanna go to my school, but I had no choice. I didn't make myself aware of the deadlines for C.A.M.S. so I wasn't allowed the opportunity to apply there. My dad was so mad when he found out. But never the less he cooled down and realized I was going to the high school where he went. Man oh Man let me tell you about this school, it is a good academic school but not very good for socializing and making friends. They make rules and restrictions on just about everything. Most of them don't make since like we can't dye our hair or get braids with other color hair in it. We can only wear a school approved sweater or letterman jacket. I guess they figure you can pay the tuition you can buy a  $40 or 50  jacket. Did they ever think twice about that? No they could care less. I'm all upset now I need to leave and blog some more later.

       To say that I'm interesting would be a lie. I am probably your typical teenager. I love to hang out with my friends when I can or I'm not being lazy, there is the whole teen-angst thing I got going on and of course I am always "mad at the world" as my dad would put it. I am pretty laid back, and if you wanna talk baseball or politics I'm your gal. Keeping up on what's going on in the world is very important to me because I will soon be a voter. I love to shop and I am very girlie but I also love to talk sports. People always say why do you talk about that, why are you so into sports, why this and why that? I am who I am so get over it. If you don't wanna talk sports with me that's to bad, I'll find someone who will. I am very strong-willed and I couldn't care less about what people think of me, but don't think I wont say anything if you talk mess about me. I would close with something witty, but I'm to sleepy to think, so until tomorrow I bid you farewell.

       Just to tell you a little about me, I am a high school student in the California area. I am actually a senior going to graduate and hopefully going off to the college of my choice. I was inspired to right my own blog because of all the good things i've heard about it, I just really needed to express myself constructively without yelling into a pillow to release my anger and frustration. You would think I was a well adjusted teenager, I have everything I could possibly ask for: my own room, computer, cell phone and I go to a private school to top it off, so what could I possibly be angry and frustrated about? Well I am actually very stressed out most of the time. I have a lot to live up to, my brother graduated from Stanford, my sister went to Harvard and now I feel like I should be able to accomplish at least a high score on the SATs. I am frustrated by the stupidity of our government and what dress I should wear to prom. I'm 16 and unable to vote so why should I be worried about who's going to win in the upcoming election. To tell you the truth I don't blame people for not thinking the youth cares about any of the issuses becasue the majority of them don't vote. I like to make it well known that I am very opinionated and really do care about what will happen to my world once I and a member of the larger socirty. I may be young but I am just as concerned about the issues as the next person.
