You have once become my  urlLink love , my Life. Times when peace and happiness seemed more like intruders in my life than the familiar companions they are today. Times when we struggled to know each other, but always smoothing out those rough spots until we came to share ourselves completely. We can never rid our lives entirely of sadness and difficult times but we can understand them together, and grow stronger as individuals and as loving couple. If I don’t tell you so often as I’d like, it’s because I could never tell you again... that I’m grateful for you sharing your life with mine once and that my  urlLink love  for you will live forever in my heart whether is it as memories...

And if I find a new  urlLink love , I view the past as a teacher. In the game of  urlLink love , to me, it doesn't really matter who won or who lost. What is important is I know when to hold on and when to let go… Have I?…   I know I really  urlLink love  someone when I want him to be happy, even if his happiness means that I’m not part of it. Everything happens for the best. If the person I  urlLink love  doesn't  urlLink love  me back, I will try not to be afraid to  urlLink love  someone else again, for I’ll never know unless I give it a try. I’ll never  urlLink love  a person I  urlLink love  unless I risk for  urlLink love . But the question is… Will I be able to  urlLink love  that person the way I loved you?…    urlLink Love  strives in hurting. If I don't get hurt, I don't learn how to  urlLink love .  urlLink Love  doesn't hurt all the  urlLink time . Though the hurting is still there to  urlLink test  me, to help me grow. Don't find  urlLink love , let  urlLink love  find me. That's why it's called falling in  urlLink love  because I don’t force myself to fall. I just fall… But why you want me to force myself to fall for someone I don’t love?…   I cannot finish a book without closing it's chapters. If I want to go on, then I have to leave the past as I turn the pages.  urlLink Love  is not destroyed by a  urlLink single  failure or won by a  urlLink single  caress. It is a lifetime venture in which we are always  urlLink learning , discovering and growing. I am… The greatest irony of  urlLink love  is letting you go when I need to hold on and holding on when I need to let you go. We lose someone we  urlLink love  only when we are destined to find someone else who can  urlLink love  us even more than we can  urlLink love  ourselves. But still, to me, destiny has always been in my hands for me to create a better tomorrow for us… I don’t depend on destiny… I allow destiny to depend on me to create my own hope for a better tomorrow...   On falling out of  urlLink love , it takes some  urlLink time  to heal and then I get back on the bus. But I tried not to make the same mistake of boarding the same one that alighted me the first  urlLink time . But I did it out of Love…   To  urlLink love  is to risk rejection, to live is to risk dying, to hope is to risk failure. To believe is to risk miracles. But all this risk must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is risk nothing! To reach for you is to risk involvement and commitment, to expose my feelings is to expose my true self towards you which I had and to  urlLink love  you, is to risk not to be loved in return…  How to define love: fall but do not stumble, be constant but not too persistent, share and never be unfair, understanding you and try not to demand, hurt but never keep the pain which I am still trying…  urlLink Love  is like a knife. It can stab my heart or it can carve wonderful images into my soul that always last for a lifetime. Or in memories of years…    urlLink Love  is supposed to be the most wonderful feeling. It should inspire me and give me joy and strength. But sometimes the things that gave me joy can also hurt me in the end. Loving you means giving you the freedom who you choose to be and where you choose to be. For all the heartaches and the tears, for gloomy days and fruitless years, I should give thanks, for I know, that there were the things that helped me grow.   Loving you means giving you the freedom to find your way and for me to be patient while you are doing your findings.Whether it leads towards me or away from me.  urlLink Love  is a painful risk to take but the risk must be taken no matter how scary or painful it is to me, for only then I’ll experience the fullness of humanity and that is love…   Only  urlLink love  can hurt my heart, fill me with desire and tear me apart. Only  urlLink love  can make me cry and only  urlLink love  knows why. If I’m not ready to cry, if I’m not ready to take the risk, if I’m not ready to feel the pain, then I’m not ready to  urlLink love .   There was a  urlLink time  in my life when I became afraid to fall in  urlLink love , you gave me the confident to  urlLink love  and  urlLink trust  you… I thank you… But now you know why I became afraid to  urlLink love  before you came and filled my world with love? Coz every  urlLink time  I do, just like now… I get hurt, then I figured it out… that's why I had to let you go for good… Tough it really hurts to let you go… But do I have a choice? I had… But did you give me one?… Sad to say… No…  »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»» Jß JªÑ ««««««««««««««««««««««««««««

True Love is built upon complete trust - complete by knowing that you can never be deceitful or misleading, because to do so would forever cloud the relationship with doubt.       True Love is knowing that you'd rather be with this other person than with anyone else, and you feel a sense of emptiness when the two of you are apart...        It's when you always think of the future in terms of "we" instead of "me".       True Love is treasuring the touch of the other person while feeling a sense of contentment and completeness as you emotinally and physically embrace.       True Love is wanting to make the other person happy and fulfilled in every possible way while doing everything you can to prevent their distress...       True Love is a commitment to working out the differences that will&nbsp; always come about when two people become one.       It is knowing that life will bring pain and sorrow, but together, you will support each other and overcome even the most difficult times.        True Love is showing and saying "I LoveYou" even when you both know - through a simple smile - that doing so isn't necessary.        True Love is complete within itself, and it lasts into Eternity...     »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»» Jß JªÑ ««««««««««««««««««««««««««««   &nbsp;

I really don't know what I have done... If you hate me just because of the 'emcee' thing, Do you think I wanted to be with you? I tell you... I do... but that was a wish that can never be fulfilled... When the teacher decided to pair us up, I told her to ask you first... Just as I expected... you didn't like it... when the other two selected emcees came to tell me you were not happy about it, Understand... I understand what you were thinking... I did not want to put you in a difficult position and chose to pair up with someone else... Did you know that... No... You didn't turn up for last Friday's rehearsal just because you we were paired up and you didn't give me a chance to tell you that I wasn't pairing up with anymore... Like I said... I t was a wish that can never be fulfilled... And I had to take over all your speeches... I owed you in my past life... That was what I thought... You did not apologies for backing out nor thanked me for taking over your speeches, as expected... But instead, you said you hate me... There are things I have done that you'll never know nor see... Cos you'll never see through it... If I was given a chance to make a wish... This wish is for you... To disappear form your sight forever... Like I never existed... In fact... I never existed in your presence... I was just being used... You admitted you were avoiding me... So as to not causing any more mis understandings... The irony is that when we get in touch, problems rises... when you tried avoiding me... there were also mis understandings... Is this some kind of connection that only we can identify... Is not that I didn't try... I tried not to interfere in your life... So why should I bother... Because it hurts... It hurts to know that you could forget about all the things we did together and how you just left me in lurch... So what have I done for you to hate more... I once told you that you had no rights to hate me as you know what you have done... And to just leave me like that... But now... I surrender... I realized... You can hate me as much as you want because I don't know what I have done to deserve nothing form you but your hate... Your anger was thrown on me... And I can't hate you back... I was not born to Hate... I was born to Love... That's why... And you'll never see through it... Never...   &nbsp; »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»» Jß JªÑ ««««««««««««««««««««««««««««

As you can see that he is wearing his fan club shirt! He also like 'CocaCola' as in collecting minitures... He has a cabinet in his house full of coke minitures and I added a puzzle to his collection I made for his Birthday in 2002 which was a picture of a coke bottle...

We will sing "A Whole New World" Theme song of Disney's "Aladin"... So call our Favourite... After our break up... I wanted him to listen to this song... "From This Moment" Sang by Shania Twain and Bryan White... At first... the begining part sounded wired to him but I asked him to carry on listening... I started singing as Shania... When it was the guy's part... he was like pretending to sing it... Dot dot dot... Actually... he didn't know the lyrics! Just as I thought... he liked the song... I gave him the lyrics... and the cd... And he did practise it at home I guess... It was actually a song sang Solo by Shania... But she Duet it with Bryan... Though we are apart... We still sing Duet... Though it wasn't a Song I dedicated to him... BUT... There was once... We made a promise and it wasn't supposed to be told to each other... This song... "From This Moment"... Is my Promise to him...          J:   I do swear that I'll aways be there...         I'd give anything and everything and I will always care...        Through weakness and strength,        Happiness and sorrow,        For better or worse,         I will love you with every beat of my heart...        J:      From this moment life has begun     R:     From this moment you are the one     J:      Right beside you     JR:  Is where I belong     J:      From this moment on     R:     From this moment           I have been blessed     J:      I live only for your happiness     R:     And for your love     JR:  I'd give my last breath     J:      From this moment onI give my hand to you with all my heart     R:     Can't wait to live my life with you,           Can't wait to start    JR:  You and I will never be apart          My dreams came true because of you     J:      From this moment as long    JR:  As I liveI will love you,           I promise you this          There is nothing I wouldn't give           From this moment on     J:      You're the reason I believe in love     R:     And you're the answer to my prayers from up above     JR:   All we need is just the two of us          My dreams came true because of you          From this moment as long as I liveI will love you,           I promise you this          There is nothing,           I wouldn't give          From this moment     J:      I will love you      R:     I will love you     J:     As long as I live    JR:  From this moment on...

Each night when the world is quiet and still...   Your smile and the wonderful moments    We have shared, crowd my mind...   Each day,    As I go about my routine,    You slip gently into my thoughts,   And make my smile...   Though we can't be together right now...   We are together in our Thoughts and Memories...   »»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»» Jß JªÑ ««««««««««««««««««««««««««««
