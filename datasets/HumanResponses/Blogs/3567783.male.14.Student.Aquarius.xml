      I'm currently obsessed with paranormal stuffs. Found the Atheist board at GameFAQs, and they made a pretty great debate there whether God exists or not. I'm an Atheist myself, but I always believed that anything may or may not be possible in this world.  However, I read one of the posts about if you do no believe in God, you will go to hell. I mean, that is seriously ****ed up. Does that mean a person who is good in moral terms will burn in hell if he didn't believe in God and a criminal who believes in God will go to heaven?  Still trying to figure out what is the Seven Gates of Hell. I heard there are 6 Gates at the US and a Gate at the UK.  Heavy rain in the early morning. It's been years since I smelt this kind of rain... The smell of the sea.

      Nothing much to write, except that my new e-mail is jinz_yami@hotmail.com. For those who are pissed off with me, you are allowed to throw acid on my face the next time I did that.

      What's with my English teacher forcing every student in my class to do the NIE project? She even threatens to deduct five marks from our English papers if we didn't hand it in this Friday. Did she even have the right to do that? Pn. Cheng = second ***** after Habibah.  I'm currently obssesed with Kadaj (no, not that way, you dirty minded people >_  Nothing really interesting happens in my life during the school days >_  Ja ne~

      That's my way of saying "hi". Seems to be a fresh change after the usual "hi", "hello" and "yo".  Grace was talking to Adrian and I about the world's education system and international schools. The word "international schools" made me think about Dinghy and Iona, who both graduated from the same school, aged 14 and 15 respectively. Dinghy's 18 now (I forgot to ask him what he's studying at the moment) while Iona (17) is taking medicine. Impressive, really impressive. /no1 to you two.  I forgot my dreams while I'm in a half-asleep mode, whenever my parents woke me up. I mean, it was like the dream was one second ago, then I woke up, and forgot about it. Weird...  And uh, to the readers, please post some comment about my blog, so I know that someone is reading this other than rhodry (Shaun) :P

      Sometimes, imagination is a wonderful thing. You imagined yourself being with your Mr/Miss Perfect, enjoying your lovely moments together, or getting everything that you wanted in the world, living in a luxurious house in a beautiful scenery, with the wind blowing softly on your face, and the birds chirping, and your house overlooking the sea.  Well, let's imagine the other version of the above description. You're living in hell, blood drips on your walls, there are rusty chains and weird, sick twisted monsters everywhere. You're lost, lying down on the floor, confused, terrified, and your mind seems like it's going to burst anytime soon.  ...  Maybe I've been playing too many horror games at the moment >_  I seem to be getting out of the purpose of my blog, am I not?  Well, school starts today. It's normal, no big difference, except that I only have two days left to do the dumb History folio. Habibah is THE *****. Exams starts next week, this school is so screwed up (other schools have their exams before the holidays). Oh, and Grace got herself frameless specs. She looks prettier in it. I wonder if my parents are gonna repair my frameless specs at all (it's been two months) >_

      I just finished Silent Hill yesterday. Great story, especially after the Hell that Harry (the main character) went through to get his daughter back. I wonder if there is anyone in this world that will go through dangers and risking their lives just to get the one thing they love.  Watched School of Rock a few days back, and American Pie. School of Rock is fun, especially all the music in it ^_^  American Pie, however, is full of sexual stuff (there's even a topless scene involving Shannon Elizabeth). It's about 4 guys making a pact to get laid before school prom's over. I tried watching American Pie 2, but the PS2 region lock made me can't do it -.- Hilarious comedy, anyways :D  Went back to kampung this morning to get my hair cut before the school starts. Meh, school sucks =.=

      There are many moments when I thought I saw a spirit/ghost/soul. The most I'm-100%-sure-I-saw-a-ghost was a few years back when I saw someone heading into the kitchen. I entered the kitchen to get a cup of water and I found out that no one was there. Weird, no?  And then, Silent Hill. This town is controlled by a god named Samael. Any one who has sinned, when he or she enters this town, will see illusions of weird, sick, twisted monsters, giving psychological impact to torture his or her mind. The town could switch to different "worlds", or dimensions. You might come to the town and everything looks normal, but then suddenly, everything seems to get dark all of a sudden, or the town seems to be rusty, bloody and ugly. Interesting ideas...  Ever heard of the Camera Obscura?  "It's a camera that could capture supernatural phenomenon that couldn't be seen with the naked eye.  It was designed to photograph visions of the past and spirit entities, but it was a prototype and its functions hadn't been fully tested. Photographing "things that ordinary people couldn't see" with this camera had an exorcismal effect."     The above and below statement were taken from a Fatal Frame II Plot Analysis by Haruji Sora.  The Crimson Sacrifice -------------------------  Conditions for Crimson Sacrifice to be a success (in my opinion):- -> The "elder" (in their tradition term, modern term would be the younger one)    must strangle the other to death. But sometimes the kill is not done by    the "elder" one, and the Veiled Priest would instead help to end it (refer    to Violet Diary 2). But the strangling must be done though, and the    "younger" must feel pain (maybe the more pain the better, just like the    Kusabi ritual). -> After the ritual, a crimson butterfly must appear at the neck of the    sacrificed one. -> The Remaining would remain in the human world, while the Crimson Butterfly    would flutter down the X, appeasing it. And then later it comes back and     flutter around the village (on certain times, not visible at all times) -> The sacrificed one must willing to do the sacrifice. The one who do the    sacrifice doesn't matter. Azami is willing to be killed by her sister,    Akane. Mayu was willing too, as seen in the Crimson Sacrifice ending. The    sacrificed one also must not be disagreeing with the Ritual, or at least    don't know what the ritual is about (Azami was too young back then, so she    probably don't know what's the nature of the ritual. She only wants to be    part of Akane, and Akane to kill her) -> The one who did the sacrifice must have at least some sort of small    resentment to the other twins, Akane had a resentment to Azami because    she doesn't want to kill, but Azami insisted that she do it. Mayu's was    a success because deep in her heart, she resented her sister for being a    burden to her since the accident. -> I also think that this Crimson Sacrifice Ritual might also be very similar    to the Inner Ritual (The Kusabi). The more the twins suffer, the better    the effect would be. The "younger" one would suffer physically (strangling)    and the "elder" one would suffer emotionally. As you can see, most of The    Remaining suffer alot emotionally, some had their hair turn white, some    shunned away from human contact. Akane suffered massively, and Mio too    suffer at the Crimson Sacrifice ending, where she is bewildered on what she    did AFTER the Butterfly appear.     Creepy, no? Will you perform the sacrifice if you're in either position as the elder twin or younger twin? Will you kill your own twin to save others?

      My mother says I have long fingers, like a girl. Girls in my class wished they have my fingers. Since my hands are thin, maybe I was born with female hands? o.O  Iona has finally forgived me. Arigato gozaimazu, Iona-chan. I wished that what I did would not harm our friendship :)  As to anything exciting that happened today, I played Silent Hill (the first game, on the PlayStation). I managed to finish the school (darn ugly children monsters, take these silver bullets of death!). The first boss is a gigantic lizard type of monster. Its mouth is opened horizontally. I was shooting at it with my handgun, waiting for it to open its mouth. When it stopped chasing me, I knew it was going to open its mouth and I took out my good ol' shotgun. I stood at a corner and waited. Big mistake. It suddenly lunged at me with its mouth wide open and I was BETWEEN those open mouths and I let go two shots. It fell down dead and I gave a sigh of relief.  As for my RO life, something funny happened yesterday. I was leveling with DingDing (he's a Merchant, I'm an Aco) at Geffen Tower and he was just about to attack an Elder Willow when my Musicmatch Jukebox plays Neodämmerung, the final fight scene between Neo and Agent Smith in The Matrix Revolutions. I LMAOed at that time because it was so funny, seeing a puny merchant (sorry Ding!) fighting a tree with that music on.  As to who I really am, I was born Eugene Chan Zhi Xin (stupid name given by my parents) on 15th February 1990 (a day after Valentine's) at Cheras, Kuala Lumpur. Clem (my bro) was born on 15th February 1988. So, our birthdays are on the same day and month (except year). I studied at Tadika Mickey there, then moved to Subang Jaya when I was 6. I then continued my childish education at Tadika Brainchild. When I was 7, I studied at SK Seafield for a year before moving to SK Seafield 3 (which is nearer to my house). I passed the PTS (Penilaian Tahap Satu) and skipped Std 4 to study in Std 5. I'm in Form 3 right now (darn PMR) and my new school is SMK USJ 8. Probably the best schools I ever enroled in compared to the previous ones.  Why do I feel like all my sentences are comprised of the same old boring words?

      As I promised, here are some pictures of Hikari. I took the pictures from the television, so the bright glare of the TV made the pictures blurrish (hope you don't mind :P).     Ain't she cute? :D     That's the Visual Memory Unit (Memory Card) of the Dreamcast. You could download mini-games within the game itself.  I love Hikari. For some reason, she has some nice philosophical ideas, like which came out first, the chicken or the egg (the never-ending question that no one will possibly provide a correct answer). She said that the egg came first because without the egg, there won't be any chicken.  When I first entered the Chao Garden, the first thing I found were two Chao Eggs. So, the idea is kinda true in my opinion :P  I just came back from a family gathering dinner. It was to celebrate my uncle's company's 40th anniversary. There were two tables. The food from each table cost around RM1000. The most expensive dish was the abalone, mushrooms and sea cucumbers. It costs around RM300. It tastes like crap, anyway.  It seems to be a waste of money, eating food that costs RM2000 which will be digested sooner or later. My three female cousins seemed to be great singers, to my surprise (there's a karaoke at the restaurant). They seem to speak in drawling voices, but when they sing, they seem to be like S.H.E.  And, I seem to notice that some girls stare at me. Is it because I'm cool, or because I'm a nerdy geek (this applies to one of my cousins)? Sometimes I think I look cool, but then I stare at my tiny arms and feel like a dork. Anyone care to answer this question (to those who have seen my picture before)?  About my RO life, I managed to get my Huntress at last. But then, Iona seemed pretty angry at me for using her name (said something about "you guys degrading me", which is referring to Dinghy, Clem and me). Iona, if you are reading this, I want you to know something. I LOVED your name. It's probably the most beautiful real-life name (not something like Aeris, Rinoa, Yuna, Tifa, etc.) which is why I named my Huntress after you. If you are still pissed off, I apologize and will ask Syn to change her name (Sora said it's possible, so I gotta contact Syn when he's online).  Till then, ja ne~

      So, this is my first blog. Right now, it's 12.44 a.m. and I'm feeling pretty hungry at the moment.  I had spent the entire day playing Sonic Adventure 2 (a Dreamcast game) and Ragnarok Online. My Chao (the cute, cuddly pets in SA2) asked me a question, "What's the meaning of life?". She then answered the question herself (I'm typing her reply back through memory), "Life is to be happy, sad and excited. I should live my life based on these three emotions".  Sad, but this Chao (whom I named Hikari) makes me feel a bit happier. Like there's a light shining through my question about it. I shall soon post a picture of her.  Be right back at you. I'm gonna grab a bowl of instant noodles.
