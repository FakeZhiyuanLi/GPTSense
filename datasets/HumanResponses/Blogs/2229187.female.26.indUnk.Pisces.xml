      Jeezus god. Thursday and Friday were some of the worst days at work I have EVER had. Thursday was SOOOO busy! We saw about a bazillion cases, and the neuro techs were there until 11 pm or so. The sad thing was that the last case that kept them there so late could have been taken by the surgery department. They offered, they begged, neuro declined. So they were there uber late. Then Friday I had forgotten that I had volunteered to be a neuro bitch, since two of them needed the day off. No biggie, right? Hah! We had to deal with everything left from the day before, PLUS a bunch of transfers, a CT, and having to deal with all the weekend shit (new hospitalization sheets and all). I got out of there at about 8 pm, which made it a 13 hour day for me. Sadly, it was more interesting than my ususal job, sitting in the MRI trailer running scans.    I think I'm going to go back to school. I actually think I'm going to get my engineering degree after all. Kinda dumb, I know, but it still appeals to me on a basic, intellectual snob level.   So, I can get my associates at a local community college, and then finish at the school in the city. I'm guessing, with me working, it will take about 7 years. At least. BUT, if I can manage to work part time, I should be able to finish a lot sooner. We'll see.  Saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre today. Not that great, but not as bad as some of the critics seemed to think. I am partial to Jessica Biehl. If I could look like her, I would. In a heartbeat. I'm also partial to bad movies anyway. The weird thing was that the theater was SOOOOO cold! I kept expecting to see my breath. The boyfriend kept snuggling me, but I was still ridiculously cold. I've used scary movies as an excuse to snuggle with a guy, but this was absurd!

      I have graduated to running anesthesia on neurology cases. This dubious honor is due to one of the neuro techs quitting recently. I can't say that I blame her, haven't I been thinking about doing the same myself? The upshot of this is that now my mornings are spent anesthetizing dogs who have all sorts of issues, and then keeping them alive while we inject potentially reaction-inducing dye into their cerebrospinal fluid. Imagine my joy. On the bright side, if we do the myelograms in the morning, it means I will generally get out on time in the evening. Generally.  I saw a story about some Christmas thing today on the (obscenely early) morning news. It nearly made me ill. Then I realized, "Hey, at least they waited until after Halloween!" That's really sad. At least I don't work retail anymore. Black Friday will live in my memory forever. I'm pretty sure that's where child molesters go when they die, only the customers get to sodomize them, too.  In talking with one of my coworkers, we discussed the allure of a guy who undresses you (to any extent) with his teeth. Men, take note. All it takes is nudging up the shirt, or slipping a bra strap off the shoulder, to make us shiver. I could really use more of that in my life, but then who couldn't?  Today's insult of the day: Flanksucker. Long story.

      God I hate mornings. Well, that's not totally true. I hate early mornings, which is pretty much all the weekday mornings. I don't mind mornings when I get to sleep as late as I want. And I am coming to hate the local morning newscasters; no human being should be that chipper at 5 am.   I wonder if I'll have to work late today. I never really know; it all depends on what comes through the door. Needless to say, this really screws up whatever facsimile of a social life I've had. My cries for scheduling have gone unheeded, so some days I wait 5 or 6 hours, and end up getting overtime to do one scan. It's stupid.   So, is it normal for someone in a long term, comitted relationship to find themselves ogling every good looking man that walks by? I can't decide. I just really like men! But I find that I am VERY tempted, more than I should be. I can't decide if that means that our relationship has issues, or just that I do. Hm.

      Well, here we go. I think maybe I'm just an exhibitionist at heart, hence this cyberspace soul-searching. Or maybe I'm just inherently narcissistic. I dunno.   For those of you who are wondering, Cleo is one of my two cats. She's insane. No, really insane. And she has this weird, spaced out look we like to call the "I like cheese" look. Hence the title.  We is me and my (sometimes) fiance. We've been together for five years now, and engaged for four. Until I realized I was miserable and broke it off. And then he groveled, and I reconsidered, and here I am, still living here. But I'm not wearing the ring, as if that matters.  I work in an emergency/critical care veterinary hospital, which means its a lot like ER, except with more bodily fluids, and the patients are way more pissed off. Some days are better than others, but for the most part I'm looking to do something else. After coming down with both an ulcer and gray hairs at 25 years old, I think it's time for a career change!  Mostly, I'm trying to figure out why I'm unhappy in my life. I think I'm coming up with some answers, but not many solutions. Yet. I'm also trying to decide if I'm expecting too much from myself and those around me, and life in general. Who the hell knows. So. More introspection later, the boyfriend is agitating for the computer. He wants to check his fantasy football scores.   Men.

      Um, yeah. So not doing much better at this whole blogging thing, but I'm trying, right?   Whatever. I'm enjoying it.  Work is work. My boss continues to come up with new, demeaning tasks for me, like helping him plant plants. Or literally cutting and taping little pictures and labels and stuff for a handout for him. It drives me nuts sometimes!!! I need a new job. But I seem to have specialized myself into a corner, I mean, running an MRI doesn't really make one qualified to do much else.  Things are better on the boyfriend front. We are going to Indianapolis this weekend to see the Children's Museum, among other things. It'll be fun. We are also going shopping for boots for me for his sister's wedding. I'm not a small girl, by any means, but this has been absurd!! I haven't been able to find a single goddamn pair of boots that I can zip up over my calf!!! Teach me to work out!! One of the sales guys said that about 75 percent of the women who try on the zip up boots have the same problem, so I guess I feel a little better. Maybe. But it's driving us nuts! I really hope a pair that the boyfriend tracked down at the local outlet mall will work.  It's bitterly cold here, which means the MRI trailer is freezing! I may leave the space heater on overnight, since it only got up to 62 today in here, and it was 56 when I came in.... Ugh.   I need to scale back on my spending. Things are getting a little ugly here, and it's mostly because I have no discipline.  The Indianapolis trip is going to have to be it for a while, I'm afraid. The boyfriend would want to know, but I need to deal with this on my own, which was the whole point of moving out in the first place!

      Wow. It's been far too long since I updated this. Fortunately, the chances are good that nobody reads the damn thing anyway, so does it really matter? However, the exhibitionist drama queen side of me loves this shit, so I'm back.  It has been a crazy, awful past few months. The boyfriend/fiance and I broke up and got back together again several times. I also had a (very brief) fling with a guy during one of the break up times. While he was (and still is, I'm sure) darling and sweet and smart, he's not the one for me. Sadly, I broke his heart telling him this. That said, with a little more maturity, or for the right girl, he's a gold mine. Oh well. He'll find her, I'm sure.  On a funner note, we're getting married in October. End of October, in fact, which is when a)my lease runs out (yes, I finally moved), and b) the anniversary of our first date. So it works out well. We're going to Colonial Williamsburg, VA, which is beautiful. And far away, which means planning may be a tad complicated. Oh well. We love Virginia, and don't really have any ties here, so there's no reason to have it in the greater Chicago area.  The other option was Ohio, where my family is, but I think we will actually just end up having a big reception type party there later.   Work is, well, work. Right now it's freezing cold in MRI, because it's freezing cold outside. And the trailer isn't all that insulated, apparently. So now I can't feel my toes. Dammit.  I am also beginning a career (?)  as a writer. The boyfriend and I have taken to writing poetry to each other during the day, and he's been highly complimentary. Since he's rather a poetry snob, I'm taking this as high praise indeed! If I ever write anything worthwhile, I'll jot it down here. Maybe I can be discovered and leave this bodily fluid soaked job.....

      Yeah, still not being very consistent, but hey. It's my freaking blog, I'll do what I want. So there. lol  Work continues to suck ass. My boss has lost his mind. His most recent breakdown involved literally yelling at me about how it's my fault that my personal life is screwed up, and I have a crappy attitude towards life, yadda yadda yadda. So I have a job interview this morning..... I just am sick to death of not being able to plan my life, or go back to school. So hopefully I'll find something less demanding and stressful, so that I can have a real life.  The romantic front is better, I think. I told the boyfriend I wanted to move back in, but he's not sure he wants me to. That hurt. But at the same time, if that's the case, I probably shouldn't anyway. Damn love sucks. I think I'm going to become a nun. Or a whore. Either way, love is no longer an issue!  The parents are coming for a visit this weekend. I'm excited, this is the first time they've seen our house, and been to Chicago. It'll be a fun weekend! It'll also be the first trip my dad has taken since his kidney transplant, so that will be good for him. And the dog will get to play with my little sister, which will make both of them happy.   I'm listening to "Bushwhacked" in the car these days. It's actually making my ulcer worse, I think! It's disturbing to see how much the current administration has done to screw us over. Or just blow us off. Makes me even more "Anyone but Bush" than before.  My hospital has come up with the "brilliant" idea of hiring a hospital administrator (the last one got fired about a month ago) who still works at a different hospital in a different state. He will come into ours 3 days a month for the next 6 or 12 months, and "administer" that way. I'm not sure who the genius was who came up with that idea, but they need to be beaten severely. Yet another reason I need to get the hell away from the place!  I'm really going to try to write in this more often. I hadn't realized that it had been two and a half months!!! Oh well.

      A friend recently sent me an email in which he mentioned that someone else said "there is no magic". I've been pondering that a lot the past few days, just because I can.   Being the skeptical pragmatist that I am, it's hard for me to say "Yes, there's magic in the world." And I'm not talking about David-Copperfield-make-someone-disappear type magic, just to be clear. I mean more along the lines of things-that-are-freaking-amazing-when-they-happen magic. And I think I believe in this because I see it every day at work.  One of my favorite parts of my job is c-sections. There is nothing like holding a newborn puppy or kitten in your hands and making it breathe for the first time... To see those tiny little ears, eyes sealed shut, soft little paws, and to know that nature will make them grow into healthy adult dogs, is overwhelming. Obviously not all goes well, or we wouldn't be seeing them, but it's the ones that do go well that you remember. There's something very humbling about midwifing 14 Labrador Retriever puppies, and then watching their mom immediately after surgery begin nursing and cleaning them.   Another magic - relationships. The sheer pleasure of finding someone who understands you, who thinks you're wonderful, who is twitterpated with you, is sheer bliss. And the following phase, the time when you get comfortable with each other, and really start making an "us" as opposed to "you and me", is indescribable. The fact that people can do this, and more than once, is to me more amazing than anything. That we are willing to open ourselves up like that repeatedly, despite the chance of getting hurt, is very powerful.  And there's all the little things, too. Seeing the stars in the country, and realizing that there are way more than you ever knew of.... Reading a book that speaks to you so strongly that you're sure the author read your mind.... Knowing that for every star you wish upon, someone else is too.  Yeah, magic is good. I hope I never forget that.

      So, my dearest darling dumb cat daughter has developed a new stupid habit. Sunday evening I was out and about, and when I came home, realized I was short a critter. After calling for a few minutes, I heard her scratching from my walk-in closet. I let her out, she was relieved to be out, and all was well.  So Monday, I come home from work, only to find her - in the closet. Apparently she runs in while I'm getting dressed for the day, and I just don't notice. So once again, I let her out. Later in the evening, I ran out for a minute, and came home to find her - in the closet. Today I came home from work and she was - in the closet. And, after she runs out, so excited to be free, when I reopened the door to put away laundry, she  ran back in.   And this is why I say she is retarded. She has no concept of cause and effect, no idea of how events connect. In some ways, an interesting life, but it also explains why she is always so scared. To her, everything is random. Poor baby.

      is back... Sadly, I mean neither the roller coaster nor the awful horror flick. It's a nickname for depression I picked up from a book, and it's stuck. Anyway, it's tormented me as well, and it's elected to put in another appearance.   In explaining to a friend tonight, I characterized this as a moderate "bad spell", meaning I expect it to last a few days at most, and mostly involve moodiness, and maybe a little crying. This is as opposed to a major bad spell, which happen once or twice a year. Those can lay me low for weeks, with major crying jags and emotional downturns. Whee.  Fortunately, there is medication, which has helped a ton. I still have bad periods, but the time between them can be counted in months, rather than days or weeks. And the severity is much much less. I've also learned to cope better, to not let it kick my ass. If nothing else, I get my ass out of bed and to work, and come home and take care of the critters. They keep me motivated like nothing else at times like that.  So, yeah. Not even new jammies (which are freaking awesome, by the way!) can cure this, but with the support of friends, and my own newfound strength, I'm not scared of it anymore. I hate it, but I don't fear what it can do to me. I can survive it. "Fear is the little death" and all that happy crappy.   But I won't turn down happy thoughts, if you feel like sending them my way. :)

      So, my plans for the Fourth have fallen through. I am fairly bummed about this, but suddenly have many other people interested in my company, which is quite pleasantly surprising, really. So, while no substitute, at least I won't have a chance to sit around and mope. Which I can be excellent at!  I am quite excited that Cowboy Mouth is playing at Summerfest, so I am going to see them Friday night. Or at least, that's the plan. Ihave been attached to them as a band since my freshman year of college, when my (then) boyfriend used "How do you tell someone you don't love them" to break up with me. Sort of. He said "That's how I feel, except for the I don't love you part." It was weird. And you would think that would set up a negative association, but quite the contrary. In fact, I view it as my anthem after a breakup. Odd, but there it is. I saw them last summer at Lincoln Park Zoo, but the acoustics in the venue (a large grassy area) sucked, and thus I didn't really enjoy it. I'm hoping this will be much better.  I'm feeling quite cute today. The funny thing is that while I don't really perceive a difference in how I act on cute days, guys sure can. Or maybe I just pay more attention then, but I get flirted with sooooo much on cute days! Which just turns into a virtuous circle (the positive version of a vicious circle). So yeah, I'm feeling cute, and the Victoria's Secret stuff isn't even here yet!

      Got the sale catalog the other day, and actually had the opportunity to get online and browse during a scan. That is my shopping weakness - well, Victoria's Secret and books.... I'm afraid I spent more than I should have, but I really have been wanting to buy some new fun underwear, as well as some "practical" stuff.   The problem is that at work, I wear scrubs, as does everyone else. Drawstring pants just don't stay up very well, especially while you're bending over, standing up, sitting down, lifting dogs, all that good stuff. So we flash a lot of crack. I mean a *lot*. I can't think of a single person on the day shift who hasn't inadvertently displayed their underwear, myself included. So I, at least, always make sure to wear cute stuff to work. Which pretty much equals VS. I also got a really really fun set of PJ's. I can't wait to wear them, they're all satiny, which I love!!   So, yeah. New underwear on the way. Look out, boys....

      I really meant to write more last night, but it just didn't work out. Mostly because I was exhausted.... My feeling that I needed to have some "alone time" was right on. The trigger - being in a bookstore, and realizing just how much I lost when I left my library at the house. I'm rather surprised at how broken up about it I am, really. But there were some really irreplacable ones in there. Emotionally, at least. One is a copy of The Bachman Books, which includes Rage. After Columbine, Stephen King stopped letting anyone publish that story. My signed copy of Guilty Pleasures. My old, old copy of the three Star Wars novels... There's just a lot of memories tied up in many of them, not to mention money. But the money, while it sucks, is nothing compared to the sense of loss I have.  So yeah. Ended up having a good cry, which I needed. Feeling better about it now. So I'm all excited and ready for work! Well, not really, but I can fake it.

      He looks at someone else's shoes.... Yeah, I know. This is a teeny sample of the jokes and conversation I was involved in at an actuarial party last night. Actually (no pun intended) I had a great time! It was nice to genuinely *fit in* with a group of people. As they discussed their betting pool on how many donuts a coworker would eat by the end of the year, including checking said coworker's spreadsheet that he uses to keep track, I felt postitively normal. And I don't remember the last time that happened...  That said, today I'm feeling a little out of sorts. I'm not sure why, but I suspect I need to deal with it, other than just keeping busy like I have been. Busy is good, but it's no substitute for deep thought. And I think I've been skimping on that a little lately. I'd hate to lose my brooding capabilities... :)

      So the week of the surreal continued. Nothing quite as exciting as the halon discharge, but it did include such joys as an after hours work call, to deal with a power outage for the MR, driving all over the city to find a fuse for the MR, and coming in uber early so that the AC guy could work on the MR. I hate that damn thing right now....  I'm working in ICU today. One of the techs is getting married, so most of the other day shift workers are in it or attending. It's actually kind of a nice change. I wouldn't want to have to deal with wacko clients every day, but once in a while it's amusing. And I get to wear my stethescope, since there's no chance of it being sucked in to the magnet. Yay!!  I'm feeling kinda weird about the weekend of the Fourth. Really looking forward to it, yet at the same time beginning to think that my expectations are perhaps a little too high. So I'm trying to back down from that a little.... And that way I can be pleasantly surprised!  Oddly enough, I found myself thinking about Joe Hill today. I suppose the first time you're offered crack sticks in your mind, but this is beyond that. I just keep remembering him saying "Have a good life", and I'm finally starting to feel like I'm doing that. Not that he cares, or even meant to be profound, probably, but it still affected me. God I'm so weird.... But happier, which is what's important!

      I don't even know where to start, here. Yesterday was quite possibly the most surreal day at work I have ever experienced. Except for the day the cat who swallowed the knife came in. But still.... Much of it was internal political wrangling, which I won't go into here, but I *can* share the weirdest aspect of the day. We are having the A/C fixed in MRI, and apparently this requires some soldering. So yesterday, I'm hiding in the trailer, ducking the politicking inside, and this really loud alarm thing is going off. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from, so I decided to call the guy who leases the trailer to us. I went inside to call, and then realized I didn't have his number in there. So I came back out, and said "Amy, you're a bright girl, you can figure this out...." and started hunting for a kill switch or something. Next thing I know I hear this  enormous  whooshing sound, and jets of white fog just come blasting out of the ceiling through the whole trailer! I, of course, manage to get caught in the middle of this, which scares the bejeezus out of me. I did get the door open and hung my head out, but had no idea whether or not my demise was imminent. Long story short, it turned out that it was the halon system discharging in response to the smoke from the soldering. Fortunately, halon is non-toxic, and usually just makes you dizzy because it displaces the oxygen in the room. I managed to avoid that. But I did need a beer afterwards....  After all that joy, I had Big Brothers/Big Sisters. My little is really opening up, which makes me feel all warm and fuzzy! I think he was gratified that he wanted to string some beads, and I said "Sure, that sounds fun!" instead of giving him crap. I suspect his dad, a police officer, wouldn't stand for that at home. It sounds like they may be moving to Kentucky, though, so I may not have as much time with him as I thought.  Which brings to mind my next thought, which is that I won't be moving when my lease is up, if my Little doesn't. I totally forgot that was a year commitment, so I'm going to have to stay until June, at least. Which means I need to figure out what I'm going to do here at work, and quick.  And now I'm at work at 6:00 AM so the A/C guy can finish up and we can start scanning by 8. I am soooo freaking tired. Emma is excited, though, because she got to come with. Hopefully Quigley and Lottie (her doggie friends) will be here to entertain her today.

      Another beautiful day here. I have all the windows open, which the cats are loving! They seem to think they know how to stalk stuff. They're right - if what they're stalking doesnt happen to be alive. Then they can sneak up on it just fine!  I'm really bummed that my local library isn't open on Sundays in the summer. I just found that out today, and it stinks, because I would love to go check out a book, take the dog to the park, and sit and read while she wears herself out. Oh well. I've read everything here at home I think, but I'll have to check again.  I'm going to have to start working more. The bank account is pretty anemic these days.... Ugh. But I can always pick up a swing on Fridays, still have two days off, and it'll pretty much be pure overtime. Plus a shift differential. If I didn't have company on the fourth, I'd work that, too. Since we don't get paid holidays, it's a good idea to work any that you can.   So I just saw something today about having trampolining in the Olympics. Now, one of my college roommates is a world class archer in compound bow, which is *not* an Olympic sport. This I don't understand. There is precedent for archery being a sport - and compound bow is very challenging, too. But where the hell did trampolines get involved in the Olympics?????? Stupid. And the sad thing is, it could be a huge ratings draw -- just look at the Man Show.

      Gawd, I hate insomnia. I've been afflicted since college, and while it had recently receded, last night it came back with a vengeance. Fortunately a friend from Portland was up, too, and we chatted about our respective social lives, or lack thereof. Thanks, Ken, you're the best!  Today is absolutely gorgeous here, sunny and cooler, and no humidity to speak of. So it's definitely going to be a dog park day. I may even go for a run, instead of working out inside. Nah!  I have to be seriously domestic today - cleaning, bill paying, laundry, that sort of thing. The bill paying scares me - the car has made money much tighter than I anticipated. Ugh.

      I love my family, I really do. Which is why, when my grandparents called at six AM to tell me they are coming to visit in a few weeks, I didn't scream obscenities and hang up. But boy did I want to.... I guess I should just be grateful that they called first!   I was thinking about airports today. In part because NPR had a piece on the phone calls made on 9/11 from the planes and stuff, and in part because my guest is flying into town. Airports are usually either the happiest or saddest places in the world. There's something really special about those moments, waiting for your loved one to step off the plane, and back into arm's reach. I've had a few of those, from both ends, and it's great. But it's the putting your loved one on the plane that's hard. Harder still these days when you can't wait at the gate, but have to say goodbye at security. It's that pain of watching your best friend move away or something. But even that is better than watching the business travelers, the ones who are so fixated on their destination that they miss all the little joys around them. Like the reunions. I hope I never lose sight of the small pleasures around me, whether it be puppy kisses, or the touch of a lover, or just a nice cold beer on a hot day.

        I got a good amount of sleep last night, and yet I am still tired. I choose to attribute that to my rather vivid dreams. Sadly, they weren't fun - no, they were about work. Whee. I can't even get away from the damn place when I'm sleeping!  Talked to my mom last night, which is always nice. While our relationship has been rocky in the past, over the past four or five years things have improved significantly. I think we've both mellowed. And she and my dad have been real pillars of support for me over the past few months, which has meant more to me than I can ever articulate.   I've started to seriously poke around looking for relocating type jobs for after my lease expires. Sadly, I haven't had any luck finding an ECC/specialty hospital in New Orleans, but there are several in Virginia, one in Florida, and one in Texas. I don't think I'm up to living in Texas, though. Ick. I would love to be in Virginia for a while, though.... Not sure how I feel about Florida. Except it's hot. lol  I'm coming to some interesting insights about myself. (Amazing what alone time can do for you...) I am suddenly much more adventurous and outgoing lately. Well, maybe not outgoing. But I feel a lot more - strong, lately, I guess. I've rediscovered my center, I think. Or made a new one, I'm not sure. I just know I feel more grounded and stable, which gives me a good base to launch off of, and do things like move to Virginia or New Orleans or wherever. If I decide that's what I want to do.  Yeah. All in all, despite work and money and stuff - life is good. And it's good to be able to say that again.

      Damn my job sucks. Well, it could be worse, since I do have time to post from here. But I would much prefer to be busy, doing something productive. Oh well.  So my new drink of choice is black and tans. I am well on my way to becoming a hard core beer snob.... But is that a bad thing? Aside from the sheer cost of buying decent beer.   The MRI refused to work this morning. I'm finding that I have become more comfortable with troubleshooting the piece of crap, but today I caved in and just began swearing at it. That seemed to do the trick. Ironic, really, because I was swearing in English, yet the system is from like Sweden or something. I guess it's bilingual.  I think I want to move to New Orleans. Anybody know of a good vet hospital down there?

      I'm really really really trying to be more consistent about posting here. Fortunately, we'll be doing plenty of scans today, which should provide the time.  Had a pretty good weekend. Hung out with various friends, saw Riddick (not too bad, but not that good) and Bubba Ho-Tep (funny as hell). Took the dog to the park, but sadly didn't wear her out as much as I would have liked.  I'm quite excited, I'm having a visitor over the Fourth of July weekend. I haven't had anyone visit just me, so it'll be quite the adventure. The company should be excellent, and I've come up with about a million different things to do, so we'll keep busy. I just hope I don't disappoint!

      Wow, two posts in one week. I'm on a roll.   Today has been a busy, but good, day. I am finding that I am finally able to look ahead and focus on my future, instead of spending all my energy slogging through day to day type stuff. The closest feeling I can think of is how I felt right after I graduated from high school - like the world is mine for the taking. It's great!  So, my friend at work who got fired was offered her dream job in San Francisco. I am so happy for her! I will miss the hell out of her, though, and am trying not to think about that. If nothing else, now I'll have a reason to visit out there!  Had the genuine pleasure of speaking to a new friend today. You know the term "radio voice"? That's him. I swear, I could listen to him talk for hours!! And not only that, but it was one of those conversations that could have gone on for hours about nothing or everything. I need more of those in my life.   Emma and I went to the park today. (Emma is my cuter-than-is-safe dog.) She always ends up getting humped by other dogs, but today she actually turned and barked at him this time. Maybe she's grown a backbone, too! She also insisted on swimming in the creek, which is nearly flooded these days. So now she stinks.

      I'm really bad about this, aren't I? I guess it doesn't much matter, since nobody reads the damn thing anyway, but still. What if someone did? They would think I was dead.  So, lots of new stuff going on. The boyfriend and I split, for good, a few weeks ago. It was *not* pretty, with both of us contributing to the ugliness. Long story short, I had to get a new car and move all the rest of my crap. And there was a  lot  of it. Actually, I just took the basics. The rest is still there, including almost all my books, some keepsake type stuff, and my cookbooks and recipes. I was in such a hurry, I forgot a lot of stuff. That said, now that I have wheels and such, I am feeling much much much better!!! It was the right thing to do, for both of us.   Work has been crazy, as usual. I put in my notice to transfer to the internal medicine department here, so that I can have a better schedule and go back to school. Today the HR chick said something to me about staying in radiology - apparently when my boss said something about changing the imaging schedule, and I said I'd consider it, he thought I meant I would be staying. Uh, no. They just fired one of our best techs over politics, there've been all sorts of ethical issues, *and* I can't have a life. No way I'm staying. Morons.  Despite all the drama, I'm actually doing really really well. I'm happier and more relaxed than I have been in a long time, and am actually feeling like I might have a chance at a normal life. Have met some really great people lately, and found that I had more friends already than I knew.   On a totally unrelated note, I'm thinking about moving to New Orleans when my lease is up. God I loved that city, and I keep thinking about it more and more. Now's the time, I guess, while I'm rootless and mobile. Definitely something to think about.....

      So, the seats at the Cubs game - SKYBOX!!!!!!! I was awestruck, and am fairly confident I will never get to sit in there again. But it was amazing. Free food, free drink, awesome view - we were just a little to the first base side of home plate, and Wrigley is so small that you can't be that far away. So cool.....  I think it's the first time I've ever gotten a concrete reward out of being virtuous. I like it!!!

      Today is going to be busy. I have a Cubs game with Big Brothers/Big Sisters, and then am going to spend the rest of the day with Mike. I haven't gotten a hard hat for the game, though perhaps I should. (For those of you not from Chicago, pieces of concrete have been falling from the levels above in several places. They installed a net to catch any other chunks, but I'm still a little nervous. It *is* Wrigley Field, after all, where everything that can go wrong will!) And I'm bummed that I won't be drinking any beer, but that's the price you pay for being a good role model. And I get to see the Cubbies this year, when it's absolutely impossible to (legally) get tickets, unless you know someone who has them and is willing to share. Next year should be better, since we've burned out our pitchers already, and let some of our best players go to other clubs.  Sorry. I can get intense about the Cubs! Anyway, we're probably going to see the Village tonight. I've read some not-so-complimentary reviews, so we'll see how it goes. Talked about going to the drive-in to see it, but it's supposed to be ungodly hot today and tomorrow, so I think we'll wait until the weather is nicer. And I'd like to see the Village in stereo - creepier that way! I hope.  I have neighbors!!! Someone moved into the open place next door. There are three names on the mailbox, so I really hope theirs is a two bedroom, and not a one like mine. That, or they're *very* friendly!!!

      I have such mixed feelings about my job. My work is great, and I love being a healer. But the job, well, that's something different.  Today, for example. There are three neurology techs here today. And a bunch of inpatients, who need TPRs and meds and fed and walked. And some rechecks, starting at nine. Well, the tech of whom I spoke in an earlier post, rather than doing any of the TPRs or meds or walks, decided to sit at the computer and type up the discharge instructions for dogs going home  this afternoon . Ugh. And I even came in early, because I knew the morning would suck, to help. I wound up treating more neuro patients than she did!!!!!  But the tradeoff is that I got to do the recheck exam on a dog we took a brain tumor out of four months ago. And she looks great!!!!! She's happy and healthy, and hopefully will be for years to come. Seeing her makes it almost worth all the stress and frustration, but we don't see cases like that every day, or even every week. Neurology for animals just isn't that happy a specialty....

      The problem with the shirt - well, not a problem, really, just an interesting thing, is that I wake up with waffle print on my boobs. It's good for a giggle first thing in the AM, which is always welcome. I dunno, I kinda like the zebra look.

      I asked Mike the other night if anyone had ever read to him. And they hadn't, or not since childhood anyway. For some reason, that made me sad. Not that anyone has really read to me in adulthood, either, but... So, on the drive to the Dells, and while we're there, I want to read to him. Any suggestions? I'm leaning towards Watership Down right now. One of my favorites since I was quite young, and a good story. But I'm open to ideas....

      Little newborn kittens. I love cat moms, they're so good. Protctive and loving and indulgent. A beautiful litter, probably going to be white with grey striping on face and legs and tail. Mom is so proud! Babies can't purr yet, but will soon. It's amazing to think that those little blind, deaf squeaky things will someday soon be grown up cats, all grace and agility and attitude.   I don't care much for my job, but I sure do love my work.

      I'm seriously considering taking that kitten from the other day. I know it would be bad, and I don't need another cat, but.... I just can't get the memory of her cuddled against my chest, purring her little heart out out of my mind. Well, I guess I started it. I purred to her, and then she started, and never stopped. Twenty minutes later, that was the only sound she had made, until I put her back with her brothers. Then she mewed little kitten mews.....   Argh. I'm such a sucker. And I swear these animals can spot us a mile away. I know Emma did! I keep trying to convince Mike that he needs a kitten. Or, more accurately, that she needs him. It's not working. Oh well.

      So, here's what I've got so far. Black squirrels are either a variation or a melanistic shade of gray squirrel, so they can interbreed. The theory is that black squirrels are found mostly up north because their dark color gives them a slight edge in the cold winters, and are found near cities because their unusual color messes up their camoflauge. They are by no means typical, but not rare in northern WI.   I was way off. I was guessing a camoflauge advantage. Ah well.

      I haven't been able to come up with headlines adequate to the feelings I'm trying to articulate lately. It's not often that words fail me (as I'm sure you've noticed), but I'm actually enjoying it.  Last night was, as usual, amazing. We started out talking about jobs we had. I never guessed that the overnight shift at Target could be so interesting! Actually, I'm pretty sure that's my heart talking. After having that exact conversation, we progressed to the sighing and staring. Except nowadays that tends to make my eyes leak.... And I don't mind. And after the snippet I posted earlier, well, I was beyond coherent conversation for a while.   I've tried so hard to articulate to him that the fact that he loves me, just the way I am, is utterly breathtaking to me. And he's constantly bemused, because "Well, who else would I want you to be?"&nbsp;  I'm doing a lousy job with the words this morning. I'm starting to suspect I just don't have them. But I think you guys know what I mean.

      One of my coworkers, while very sweet, has been difficult lately. She seems reluctant to work. Period. She will drag her feet and bs with everyone else to avoid doing anything. Today is my day to work as a neuro tech. I do what needs to be done, just like everyone else. So I did two anesthetic procedures this morning, helped with a third, entered charges, all sorts of stuff.&nbsp; And I knew, *KNEW* this particular coworker was going to try to pawn another MRI off on me. So when she asked if I wanted to do it, since she had done one procedure, and that was all, all day, I said "Actually, no, but thanks for asking."  Now she's pissed at me. And I don't really care. I mean, there's no reason for me to be the only person to do anesthesia today. Particularly since that would have ended up being six procedures. But - she's gotten other people fired when they pissed her off. I'm not sure if I care, though. I refuse to be hostage to her laziness. And if I get fired, well, at least I get unemployment!

      Is driving all the way to north Chicago from St. Louis to get an MRI for your old, old lab.   It's also *not* taking a teeny tiny kitten that needs a home, and curls up on your chest purring little teeny purrs while you work. Because that would be bad. But oh so tempting. Stupid kitten season.  It's also sleeping in his shirt, even though you were just snuggled up twenty minutes earlier. Or maybe that's just a sickness. Oh well.

      Mike's birthday is coming up. He says he doesn't celebrate it, but that just doesn't fly with me. Birthdays, and half birthdays, and unbirthdays, are to be enjoyed. So.... Since he wouldn't tell me anything about what he liked, or even what cake he wanted, I called in reinforcements.  All Mike's recipes are emails from his mom, so I swiped one, emailed her, and begged for advice. And found out that his favorite cake growing up, and that he had at his graduation party, was twinkie cake. Oddly enough, it's chocolate cake. But whatever. The funny thing is that I appear to have made a real friend in his mom, all unintentionally.  I also am supposed to get Tootsie Pops for the trip to the Dells. I hate the damn things. Oh well. What we do for love.

      Impossible to find the words. At least, not adequate ones. Love, while it has a lot of oomph, can be too ambiguous. Twitterpated is too cutesy now. I'm just - gone. And here. Swept up and tossed and set back down with disheveled emotions and a grin on my face. I feel like time has just jumped track, racing and stopping at the same time. It should give me motion sickness, but instead I just get weak-kneed. Laughing and crying are much the same sometimes. And I have no room for fear in my life anymore. Get you off the skin of this earth! And I find my fight and spirit, sick for so long, and now whole again. I'm overwhelmed and humbled. And so damn ready.

      I just sat down and evaluated things for a few minutes. Here's what I'm thinking:    I am absolutely stunned at where I am right now. Six months ago, if anyone had described this to me, I would have called them a nutjob. Or a flanksucker.  I am very much enjoying watching your relationship unfold. As far as vicarious living goes, you guys are great!!   I am even more enjoying watching my own relationship unfold. But it'd be pretty messed up if I didn't.   I'm approaching the point where I'm ready to get serious about working out and stuff. I think this is a good thing. I just wish salad were cheaper.  I finally feel like I know myself again. I'm glad. I missed me.  I'm happy. I was so scared before that I would never be happy, and now I am. If I believed in God, I would be grateful. Hell, I'm grateful anyway.  I have met some neat people lately, and made some very good friends. Thanks.   I would much like to see any and all of those friends in Chicago some day fairly soon. I don't get enough visitors (read: any), and I gotta show off the place to  somebody !   Okay, that's all for now. Carry on.

      Movies I watch to fall asleep to. Or when I'm feeling sad or stressed. Movies I know by heart.     Star Wars (Any of the the original trilogy, but especially A New Hope)  The Saint  Deep Blue Sea  Moulin Rouge  Raiders of the Lost Ark (just Raiders - not nearly as fond of the other two)  Toy Story  Dangerous Beauty  Brotherhood of the Wolf  Drop Dead Gorgeous  Aliens   Looking at this list I realize that my movie tastes are terribly eclectic. Disney next to the porn, and all that... And I like it. I love when someone comes over, looks at my movie collection and says "Oh, I love that movie!! I can't believe you have it!" And I love to share them, to send them home with people to watch and love the way I do.  (I'd do that with books, but I don't know many people who read as fast or as often as I do, and I would never get them back. And I'm fiercely protective of my books, especially since I have so few of them now....)

      I love yoga. I started in college. One of my roommates and I would do (insert body part here) of Steel four days a week, and yoga on&nbsp;a fifth. It actually helped me sleep. And anything that could help me sleep then was a freaking miracle. So I've continued.  I love the feeling of centeredness I get. Since I've stopped playing soccer, I've lost touch with some of that. Sounds corny, but there was an awareness of my body, my muscles, how they all worked, when I played. And I knew how to get to that place where nothing exists but the now. It was almost a form of meditation, I guess. Anyway.  I like yoga because it helps me get back there. Plus I can feel my muscles stretching, lengthening. Feel my balance improve. Feel my heart rate slow, my blood pressure drop. I just feel more - me. The me I would be without stress and pain and grief. The me who still knows how to stop&nbsp;a breakaway forward, or how to intimidate a shooter on a penalty kick. I kinda miss that me.

      That's what Mike calls it. We spent most of the weekend saying "I was just going to say that!" or something to that effect. We were listening to the Return of the Jedi soundtrack before lunch the other day, and standing in line, we both started humming the same bar of Ewok song at the same time. If it weren't so wonderful it would be scary!  And we both say "one fell swoop".   Yeah. I've got it bad. And I'm enjoying it. I love that he can read my geeky mind. That we can be lying on the couch trying to decide which variables we would include in an algorithm to predict crowd movement at a concert. (The consensus was bathroom location, beer tent location, age, music volume, and gender... I was in favor of more, but Mike thought it should be simple. No, we didn't actually write it!) I love that he rumbles down in his chest when he's happy - the grizzly bear version of a purr. I love that he gets misty eyed about us as much as I do. I love that he included "Brown Eyed Girl" in the playlist we listen to before bed.   I think I love him.  Wow.

      I was listening to NPR this morning on my way to work. Fairly typical for me, really. It's an easy way to get my news fix, among other things. But anyway... There was an amazing story about a woman who received a heart transplant. How she was scared she would die before she received a new heart, her recovery from surgery, her pain at realizing 'her' heart was dead and gone, and the guilt she felt about her donor, a young girl she had never met.  This really hits home for me, because my dad has had a kidney transplant, not once, but twice. A hereditary condition caused him to go into total renal failure at the age of 29.&nbsp; After dialysis, he received a transplant. I vaguely remember that surgery. Mostly the scariness of going to visit him afterwards. We had to scrub and glove and mask, and for a 7 year old girl, it was frightening stuff.&nbsp; But he did amazingly well, and was able to do everything he had before, and then some. He started long distance bike riding about ten years ago, just to keep in shape.  Then, two years ago, he rejected the transplanted kidney. Actually, he got longer out of it than anyone had expected, but it was still a shock. Suddenly, we were back to dialysis, strict diet, and eight million meds a day again. And now I knew enough to be really scared. The first time I saw him, he had been in failure for a few months, and he had lost so much weight. All I could think was "oh, my daddy...." And I don't remember the last time I called him Daddy.  But we got through it. He recieved a kidney this past Valentine's Day. I drove home to see him, and nearly passed out in his room. Something about seeing all that stuff, knowing what it did, and remembering the time years earlier, just threw me for a loop.  That night, my stepmother told me about his donor. A police officer, with a wife and child. Hit by a car while helping load a car onto a tow truck after an accident. A man who risked his life on a regular basis, and was brave enough and caring enough to not let that be the end of his community service. I am, as ever, in awe of donors and their families.  Anyway. I found myself wondering if dad felt the same way as the woman in the story. I don't know that I'll ever be able to ask. But I did send the link to my stepmom. I think she'll enjoy it.

      At least for today and tomorrow. The boss is moving, so it's all me. I'll get to make decisions and everything!!! I just hope surgery and neurology don't get in a pissing contest over me. They've been pretty good though, lately. Playing nice and everything. Maybe somebody's started slipping Prozac in their coffee....

      Playful, kind, and well-loved, you are The Peach. &nbsp; &nbsp; For such a warm-hearted, generous person, you're surprisingly experienced in both love and sex. We credit your spontaneous side; you tend to live in the moment, and you don't get bogged down by inhibitions like most women your age. If you see something wonderful, you confidently embrace it.   You are a fun flirt and an instant sweetheart, but our guess is you're becoming more selective about long-term love. It's getting tougher for you to become permanently attached; and a guy who's in a different place emotionally might misunderstand your early enthusiasm. You can wreck someone simply by enjoying him. &nbsp; &nbsp; Your ideal mate is adventurous and giving, like you. But not overly intense.

      The funny thing is, I wouldn't have picked to live here. Like many things in my life, it just sorta happened, and I have learned to live with it. Only this time, I've come to love it. I seem able to do that quite a lot - is that part of the easygoing Pisces thing? I dunno. And it's only cold here in the winter - right now, it's anything but. Beautiful, actually. I've had all the windows open all weekend. Except for the bedroom ones, because they're right by the door to the building, and that's none of anyone's business....  Yeah, the whole tollway thing sucks. The first time I drove home to Ohio, I took the Skyway, which was a TWO DOLLAR TOLL!!! I was stunned. I'll have to tell the cop story from that trip sometime, too. I think of it as they charge money to leave, too. The cool thing is that I'm learning how to go around the tolls..... All sorts of surface streets!  Yeah, well when you think about all the icky animal stuff I bring home on a daily basis, I'm not real worried about your contribution. :) As far as finding you, well.... I'm smarter than I look. And you can search on gender, age, and location. And I recognized the speech pattern, before I even saw the pics. Funny, huh?

      So the shelter thing didn't go so well today. Mike came over to drive me there, because I was basically falling apart. Get there, to be met by a girl who says&nbsp;"Did you  call ?" Um, no. Didn't really feel like giving up my daughter over the phone. Well, they're full. Period. Gave me the numbers of other no-kills in the area, most of them in the south Chicago suburbs, so an hour or hour and a half away. I'm certainly willing to go that far, but not until I know they'll take her. So I just went home. So I have to go through all that emotional girding of loins again next weekend. Assuming I can find somewhere that can take her - it is kitten season, after all.  The upside of this (and I looked long and hard to find one) is that Mike still thinks I'm cute when I've been crying and my eyes are all puffy.&nbsp; And he knows how to hold a sobbing woman - quietly, and with plenty of kleenex nearby.

      Today will be tough. My retarded daughter has finally pushed me over the edge. She sprays. Always has - since she was about six months old. For the last six years, I've been patient. I've paid extra carpet cleaning fees every time I've moved. I've tried drugs. I've tried behavior modification. I've done urinalyses every six months. Nothing has worked. And I can't afford to clean my carpets every week anymore.   So today we're going to the local no-kill shelter. It's killing me. I know better than to go alone, because I won't be able to drive back. I feel so badly - I took responsibility for her when she was just&nbsp;a few weeks old. I've tried so hard to love her, and that part is easy. But I just can't live with her anymore. I'm hoping&nbsp;she can find a home, with some little old lady who lives by herself, where she's not stressed and doesn't spray, and she can be happy. And hopefully forget her Mama, who loves her and just doesn't know what else to do.   I'm so sorry, Cleo. So very goddamn sorry.

      Sometimes I feel old. Not in&nbsp;a decrepit sort of way, but in an I-remember-what-it-was-like-to-be-younger-way....   When I was 20, I met this amazing guy. I was in a lonely spot in my life. I had dropped out of school, moved out of my parents' house (I had strained relations with them at the time), had no local&nbsp;acquaintances except for the ex who had cheated on me repeatedly, and was flat broke. It was rough. I met this guy online, who was lonely and having a tough time at work. We chatted. I went into nurturer mode, because that's what I do.   We met. We fell in love. I was content to let him be in charge. He was older and wiser, and I was passive. I just wanted to be with him. He gave me everything I wanted, basically supported me, since my job paid less than peanuts. And I was okay with that. We got engaged. I was 21.   Things went on that&nbsp;way for a while.&nbsp;A long while. And then I started to get restless. Frustrated. Stifled. It took me sooooo long to figure out why. Four or five years, to be exact. I had surrendered my right to be myself. Willingly, but not understanding the consequences. And once I started to realize that, I knew just how unhappy I was. Well, I had known. Acknowledged, I guess.   So now I'm trying to sort out who I am these days. I've made a lot of progress. Figured out a lot of stuff. I am no longer willing to change for someone, except myself. I don't want to be the only thing someone has in their life, friend or lover. I want to be spontaneous, silly, goofy. I want to be in control of my life, not the other way around. I'm tired of just going with the flow - now I'm actively rowing.   I just am amazed at how much I've changed over the past six years. The me now would never have bowed to the situation I was in then. I think back to my college days, or even just a few years ago, and feel so different. So jaded. And now hopeful all over again. It's -- odd.

      One of life's joys. My family has always camped, since I was very small. Mostly semi-hardcore camping, really. No running water, but with an outhouse. Grandparents' house nearby in case of rain, that sort of thing.  Every year we have the Doins in the Woods. My great-grandmother named it that probably 15 or 20 years ago. Closer to fifteen, I guess, since I remember it. It was my grandmother's family's Thanksgiving. Since the actual holiday was frequently problematic, they moved it to summer. And then it turned into a campout at my great-aunt's place, with a pond for swimming and one for fishing, and woods and fields and stuff. Every summer the family gathers, with friends and extended family. We get eaten alive by mosquitoes, bathe in the pond, and cook awesome, awesome food. Like fried taters and onions.   Fry a pound or two of bacon in a cast iron skillet over a fire. When the bacon's done, add 3-5 pounds of sliced potatoes, and 3-4 sliced onions. Beat a dozen eggs in a bowl. When potatoes and onions are almost done, add eggs. Stir frequently. Have heart attack. Die happy.  Last year was my first year at the Doins as a grownup. I missed several years because I was in the pacific northwest, and I was excited to go back. I bought a tent. We had sleeping bags. I got bugspray. I packed my swimsuit. I got there, set up my own tent, and realized I had forgotten pillows. Ugh. But it was great. I did all the adult stuff - helped cook, watch the kids in the pond, set up the games.... And I reveled in my family's company. I had missed it so much. The old jokes, the stories, seeing how big some of the kids had gotten. The big excitement - they put in a new outhouse, with a floor. Whee!!  I missed the Doin's again this year. It was last weekend, and I pined a little. But next year I plan on going. I'll take Emma, if I can get over my paranoia over Lyme disease and West Nile. And maybe I'll have someone else to take with. I hope so - I would love to share more than just the words.

      I have two pieces of art at the moment, what I remembered to take in the exodus (as I now call it). One is an old, old print called the Horse Fair, in a beautiful cherry frame. It was my great-grandfather's, and when he died, I got to have it.  The other is a print by  urlLink Michael Parkes  called "Diamond Warrior". I love it. It's a beautiful piece of a woman, standing wrapped in the wings of an angel type figure. It's always reminded me of the feeling of being held by someone who loves you and wants to protect you... It still takes my breath away. But many of his other pieces are neat, too. I highly recommend "Dawn", "Athena", and "The Creation".

      The current book I'm working on. Between bouts of Final Fantasy. It's about a future of pure capitalism, where nothing gets done unless you have money, and the cops are out for hire. As is the NRA. Where your last name is your employer's.   Anyway. The author created this website,  urlLink http://www.nationstates.net , where you can build your own nation. It's pretty cool, if you're into that whole political thing, which I am. Mine is EmmaSunshine.

      I was talking to my boss yesterday. He had mentioned how much he liked Cincinnati, and being an Ohio native, I had to agree. We ended up chatting about how everyone finds a city that they really resonate with, and they feel at home in. They may leave, but they will come back. I think Chicago will be that city for me.  I love that there is so much to do here. Amusement park (right across the street, no less!), museums, festivals, bars, restaurants, beaches.... There are three zoos within 60 miles of my apartment! There's public&nbsp; transportation out the wazoo. You can be downtown and see an "adult toy store" next to a comic book place and the army surplus store.   Our skyline is beautiful. We have the Cubs if you're into unrequited love, or the Sox if you like to win. And the Bulls if you're just dumb. We love our loser teams. We get snow, real snow, in the winter, and it actually gets hot in the summer. You can grow roses here.   So. Come see scenic Chicago!! I have a futon you can sleep on. If you don't mind critters.

      (before bed) So the chicken and the egg are lying in bed together. The egg is smoking a cigarette and looking *very* smug. The chicken is rather frustrated. Finally it bursts out - "Well, now we know the answer to  that  question!"  Sorry. But it made me chuckle.  Oh, and not only did Mike forget his shoes last night - he missed not one, not two, but  three  turns on the way home. Makes a girl feel pretty damn captivating, I gotta admit!

      Not feeling sad, really. Just in the mood for sad music. In fact, feeling extraordinarily content. I have good critters, good friends, and good family.

      Nothing is so good it lasts eternally Perfect situations must go wrong But this has never yet prevented me From hoping for too much for far too long  Looking back I could have played it differently Won a few more moments, who can tell? But it took time to understand the man Now at least I know I know him well  Wasn't he good? Wasn't he fine? Isn't it madness he won't be mine? But in the end he needs a little bit more than me more Security (He needs his fantasy and freedom) I know him so well  No one in your life is with you constantly No one is completely on your side And though I move my world to be with him Still the gap between us is too wide  Looking back I could have played it differently Learned about the man before I fell (I was just a little careless, maybe) I was ever so much younger then Now at least I know I know him well

I know you can't resist Trying to reopen a sore  Believe me I don't want to argue I just get confused and I come all undone If I agree well it's just to appease you Cause I don't remember what we're fighting for

      I guess my response wasn't cordial enough. The ex responded with a not-so-friendly reply about the joint bank account I closed almost two weeks ago. I really need to stop being hopeful that we can have a friendship, because I'm tired of the sting when he goes from warm to cold. I guess&nbsp; I should just start ignoring him. It just seems so - immature.

      When I was in high school, my friend Gregg and I often wore the same color shirts. Now, part of that was some little saying "Wear green on Thursday, purple on Friday, and get laid on the weekend." Sadly, it didn't work - well, not for me. But anyway.  Today, Yolanda and I are identical. We even have on the same color bras.... I like to think it's some weird wavelength thing. For some reason, I get a huge kick out of it. I'm such a dork.

      So the ex emailed again last night. This was a nice, friendly email. I liked it. But it makes me wonder if he's reading the blog. I'd be surprised, but whatever floats his boat. It's almost like the him I knew is gone, and now I'm getting to know a new one.&nbsp; It's nice and sad all at the same time.   Mike has asked me to go on a long weekend trip to the Dells with him the first weekend in August. I really really want to say yes, but I'm a little nervous, too. I mean, that implies a certain amount of seriousness I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to yet. I guess it's my way of maintaining control, witholding my "commitment".&nbsp; Really, emotionally, the idea of him dating other people makes me want to growl and bite things, and I'm not interested in dating other people either.   Christ, who am I kidding? I'm going. And we'll have a great time. And I'll probably fall in love, which isn't a bad thing, but I'm just scared as hell. I'm so sick of being scared.

      Until tonight, the greatest compliment a guy ever paid me was the ex. When we went out to see Les Mis, on Broadway. I was all spiffed up, black velvet sheath dress, heels, whole nine yards. When we went to leave, he tried to lock the apartment door with the car remote.  Tonight... Mike left. Without his shoes. He had to come back for them. And I'm overwhelmed.

      Today has been hectic. On Wednesdays I'm a neurology bitch, so I get to do even more work for the same crappy pay. Whee. But today will likely pay off, since I bitched about my performance review (or lack thereof) to HR. She freaked out, stuck a couple of reviews in the neurologist and radiologist's boxes, and promised that my annual raise (which I didn't get) would be retroactive. To November. So I'm being very well behaved today! I need the money, badly. Very badly.   But it's still been a long day. My knee is still hurting quite a bit, and I've lost a fair amount of range of motion. I'm using it too much, probably, but not much choice in a job like this. And I'm afraid if I keep taking Advil the way I have, I'll either blow out my kidneys or piss off my ulcer. So I need an alternative. I wish Celebrex weren't so damn expensive, I'd go back on that for a while.   Saw Mystic River last night. A very very good movie, but definitely a disturbing one as well. Sean Penn has grown into an amazing actor, especially after watching Fast Times at Ridgemont High the night before.   Missing the ex today. Just some of the little rituals we had, little exchanges that meant nothing - except to us. I miss the house. My rose bushes. I wonder how they're doing? The guest bedroom I was going to paint this neat aqua color, in stripes on two walls, and solid on a wall or two. I love that house, and leaving it was so very very hard.

      This is the song one ex used to sort of break up with me. It's angry and mournful and angsty all at the same time. Good stuff.

How do you tell someone you don't care anymore?  How do you tell someone&nbsp; you don't love them anymore?   Tina says the pictures that we took are put away  Inside a box of memories for cold and rainy days  Poems in pencil rhyming with the things you'd never say  There's a little girl who's crying over here   Michael's old engagement picture's in a wooden box  His wooden heart's as tough as nails, he's solid as a rock  Keeps himself protected with a combination lock  There's a little boy who's crying over here   Did you ever know me?/I swear that I have tried  Did you ever need me?/I feel like I just died  Did you ever want me?/I swear that I have tried  How do you tell someone you don't love them?  How do you tell someone you don't care anymore?  How do you tell someone&nbsp; you don't love them anymore?   Tina says I wish that I had never seen you smile  Your name is written on my soul in alphabetic file  All I've got's my dignity, so I will leave in style  There's a million of us crying over here   Did you ever know me?/I swear that I have tried  Did you ever need me?/I feel like I just died  Did you ever want me?/I swear that I have tried  How do you tell someone you don't love them?  How do you tell someone you don't care anymore?  How do you tell someone&nbsp; you don't love them anymore?

      So I realized last night why I'm falling so hard. Mike is totally fine without me. He's not looking to me to fill a void in his life, or play a specific role. He just wants me to be myself. That's a first for me. It's been overwhelming, really. And he doesn't really understand, because his experience with women, while not nonexistent, is rather limited. And I can't seem to articulate it. But I can feel it. And it's great.

My days are brighter than morning air/Evergreen pine or autumn blue/But all my days were twice as fair/If I could share my days with you My nights are warmer than fire coals/incense or stars or smoke-filled rooms/But nights would warm beyond compare/If I could share my nights with you To dance in my dreams/To shine when I need the sun/With you to hold me when dreams are done/And oh my dearest love if you would be my love/Then all my dreams are truly come And time weaves ribbons of memories/To sweeten life when youth is through/But I would need no memories there/If I could share my life with you  Sappy, yeah. Musical, yeah. And still makes my throat tight.

      I am so very sick to death of working in a place that neither rewards good performance, nor punishes poor performance, and then laments the lack of initiative in its employees. You simply cannot motivate people to work hard when they don't get reviews, raises, or even paid holidays, and yet they see the administration driving around in Lexuses.  &nbsp; I need a raise. I need a new job. I need to know that not only do I make a difference, but that is appreciated, and if I go above and beyond, that will be appreciated and recognized.  &nbsp; Anybody hiring?

      Is is just me, or does it look like that movie is going to suck? I mean, *I* don't even want to see it, and I want to see Anacondas!! I think part of it is the outfit. Michelle Pfeiffer's was much much better. &nbsp; I've drunk 1.5 L of water today. Yay for me! I've decided that's more realistic than two liters. Though I should probably drink more, just to keep up with my alcohol consumption.  &nbsp; Craniotomy today. We've had a run on them. Hopefully it will go well.... I should post some pics sometime. It's wild.  &nbsp; My knee hurts. A lot. Ibuprofen helps, but not enough. I think I'm going to be hurting for a while. &nbsp; Emma is sooo in love with Mike. It's cute. He won't let her lick his face - yet. I think the time will come. The ex started out the same way.... I, on the other hand, get to lick his face as much as I want. Yay!!!

      I'm realizing that perhaps I've hit on this nausea thing a little too hard.... I meant it as a joke. A long standing joke, particularly since I got the impression that everyone enjoyed it, and the implications.  &nbsp; In all honesty, reading your posts, seeing these pics, is incredibly humbling. I feel very lucky to have a glimpse of something this beautiful growing and developing. There are many, many people in this world who will never experience what you guys are feeling now, and I feel sorry for them. So... Please accept my sincere thanks for sharing this with us. Remotivating, indeed. &nbsp; So, when I joke - it's because I'm not always comfortable articulating this deeper stuff. Consider nausea shorthand for awe.....

      I hate mornings. Well, I hate getting up before I'm ready. Now, getting to sleep until I wake up is a different story altogether. And my bedroom faces east, so I get sun way too freaking early.... Thank god for mini blinds.  &nbsp; Yesterday started out really really well. Sadly, it didn't continue that way. We CT'd an employee dog who turned out to have awful awful cancer in her pelvis. We didn't even wake her up, just sent her on to heaven. Poor thing.  &nbsp; On the way home, I accidentally cut a guy off - didn't even see him. He honks, I feel dumb, but what can you do? Well, then he starts following me, which scared the crap out of me. You never know who has a gun these days!! So finally he cuts me off in return and gives me the finger. Thank god that was all, but I've never tried to remember where the police station was so fast in my life!!  &nbsp; Then I went to Big Brothers/Big Sisters. That was fun, as usual, but I dislocated my kneecap playing soccer. An old injury (since I was eight or so) that I tend to reaggravate. I've actually been doing physical therapy, which honestly helped, I think. I mean, I was able to stay standing, which is better than usual. Most of the time I end up on the ground crying and whimpering. I have a lot of sympathy for these little dogs with luxating patellas!! Anyway, after that we played a board game, and Brad proceeded to tell me how once his dad had a job in Maryland, an apartment rented and everything, and suddenly his mom demanded visitation rights. So that killed the move. Then, like a year later, she stopped seeing him (Brad). And now he's afraid that she'll do that again with this move to Kentucky. It made my blood boil!!!!!!!! And all I could think of to say was "You know this isn't about you, right? It's your mom's problem, not you." I hope he understood.  &nbsp; After that I came home, took a bunch of tylenol, iced my knee, and called Mike. He came over (yay!) on the condition that we could watch American Chopper. And he brought beer. He's the best! So I layed in his lap, drank beer, and watched TV. He wouldn't let me get up to do anything. It was very cute, in a protective sort of way. Christ I'm smitten.  &nbsp; And I'm realizing I will never be able to be as nauseating as S &amp; B, and I'm okay with that. I mean, you can't compete with the masters....

      I mentioned earlier that the only societal hangup I haven't managed to duck is weight. Ironically, I was oblivious to it until I graduated from high school. I went from having five or six school activities, skipping lunch, and eating dinner at home, to having a desk job, eating out for lunch and sometimes dinner, and having little time for anything outside of that. So I gained weight. I never would have thought about it, except my stepmother said something along the lines of "What, you think that now that you found a guy you can just let yourself go?" I really don't know where that came from. It was a very out of character comment for her, and I like to pretend aliens were controlling her at the time.  &nbsp; After that, it was a niggle in the back of my mind. Now, I'm a big girl by any standards, 5'10, valued for my ability to take a hit and not fall over in soccer.... And I had always been okay with that, and sometimes even proud. It was muscle and height and I liked being 'the strong one'. But now I was fretting sometimes - what was muscle? What was fat? In college, my weight fluctuated dramatically, mostly due to depression. When I came home for a visit, and my bf said "Wow, you've lost a lot of weight!" I hadn't even noticed. Suddenly, that was in my head. Maybe if I lost enough weight, he'd want to be with me. Pathetic, but true. &nbsp; I was an eating disorder waiting to happen. Fortunately, I have the self-discipline of a slug, and thus anorexia was out of the question. And I hate puking, so bulimia was too. I guess that means I wasn't seriously neurotic enough about it. But it didn't get bad until five years or so ago. Once again, someone else's comments triggered it. My fiance and I were arguing about our sex life, and I was complaining that he didn't seem to want to sleep with me very often. He replied "Well, maybe if we both lost some weight, I would feel more like it."  &nbsp;   &nbsp; That hurt. And while he said "we", what I heard (and still hear) is "I". And then things got ugly. I'd go shopping for clothes and break down into tears. We joined a gym, which I hated every minute of going to. I didn't see results. I got frustrated. I cried some more. I raged some more. I let myself feel more and more inadequate. Our sex life continued to suck.&nbsp; This went on until last fall.  &nbsp; I was getting ready to go to New Orleans, and I wanted to look good. I hadn't seen my friends there in a year or so, and I wanted them to be surprised. I worked out five or six days a week. I ate well. I drank water. I drank less booze, though that was more to be a lightweight, and thus a cheaper drunk on the trip. And it worked. I felt good. I bought new clothes. &nbsp; And then the relationship blew up. And I lost control of my depression and just stopped caring. And now the weight is back. I spent a long, long time feeling not good enough. No more. I will *not* let my weight define me, or ruin my life. Nor will I let myself beat up myself for being fat.  &nbsp; There are several reasons I've gotten to this point. B, you're one of them. When we first started talking, your sincere compliments were exactly what I needed. Thank you. My new guy is another. He so obviously means it when he calls me gorgeous, and there's no qualifiers there. I never realized (or let myself realize) that it wasn't all my problem. That my ex had the issue, too - and it wasn't all my fault he didn't want me for who I was.  &nbsp; This is so freeing I can't even articulate it. I share the blame for what happened, but I've learned from it. And I'm stronger because of it. And maybe someday I'll be skinnier, too.

      So, in a little more detail, because that's probably what it's going to take to keep up with the nausea couple over there... :)  &nbsp; Saturday was mucho fun. Woke up all warm and snuggly and cozy.... He had to leave to shower and stuff, so I floated around in a daze for a while, got some breakfast, and just enjoyed myself. Took Emma to pick him up and drove down to the forest preserve. Let Emma run around while we sat and waited for Chris and Yolanda. Did a lot of sighing and looking into each other's eyes. (God, just writing this I'm starting to feel diabetic....) Chris and Yolanda came with Quigley and Lottie, and off we went. The dogs had fun romping and playing and sniffing. Emma and Quigs wrestled for a while. The humans gossiped and chatted and laughed at the antics of the dogs. Once the critters were tired, we headed back to the cars, and followed to Chris's place. &nbsp; (I really love that he gets along with my friends. That's soooo important. Particularly if your friends are sane about it.&nbsp; If they hate all your dates, that's one thing. But I trust Yolanda's judgement, and it means a lot to me that everyone liked each other.) &nbsp; We hung out at Chris's for a while, killing time until it was time to have my tattoo looked at. I've wanted to get my dragon filled in for a while, and Chris is friends with a guy who does some beautiful work. So we ambled over there, holding hands the whole way. More sighing. More staring. Lots of blushing on my part.&nbsp; My tattoo will cost about $250 bucks to do, because the whole thing would have to be redone. Definitely *not* in the budget. Oh well. &nbsp; Went to dinner. Mongolian BBQ. Great food, and since we alternated who watched the stuff, plenty of alone time. Played footsie under the table. Snuck in kisses. More sighing. Had conversations that we only had to have half of, really, because we knew what the other was thinking.  &nbsp; Went to the concert. Cowboy Mouth was great. Standing in front of him, letting him break the crowd for me, was even better. Sharing this music I enjoy so much, and having him enjoy it too, was wonderful, especially after my last concert date. Not much sighing or staring, but lots of touching and smooching on my part.  &nbsp; Went home. Too tired to fool around, but that whole sleeping in each other's arms things was even better. Don't remember moving in the night, but managed to follow each other's turning over in bed. God I missed that. Woke up. More sighing and staring. &nbsp; This is ridiculous. I can't even keep writing. You get the idea. I just can't stop sighing. And it's great.

      Yes, I invariably sing along with the radio. And in the shower. But humming - well, that's different. That's when life is good, even on a subconscious level, and it just sorta starts oozing out my pores. And I'm actually humming again, for the first time in a loooooong time. And yes, it's about a man, which is sad and funny and wonderful all at the same time. &nbsp; Oddly enough, I've covered a lot of today's blog topics this weekend. Facial hair - very good. Especially stubble. Kissing - mandatory, and one of the best things in the world. Ever. Understanding that a)you're as sexy as you feel and b) a partner who listens to you and responds to you is worth their weight in gold are both very important. And my own contribution - being a cuddle addict may have long, awful cold turkey periods, but those highs are mind-blowing!!  &nbsp; Okay, enough TMI. I'm going to bed to glow. Who knows, maybe one day I can be as nauseating as S &amp; B!

      And this time it *is* me.... I had a wonderful time last night. Went to&nbsp;a really lame bar downtown, spent the evening with people I don't know, and had a blast. I suspect it was the company. No, I know it was. I really really don't miss the bar scene, though had I been on the hunt, there was ample opportunity. One of the girls at this party is from out of town, and was looking for a nice little fling, so we were scouting for her. It was all the fun with none of the work! But mostly I sat on my bar stool and drank my drink (because they only had icky American beer, and I've become a beer snob) and snuggled against my date's chest. It was just - right. Not S &amp; B earthshakingly right, but more curled up in a warm blanket on the couch watching the rain fall right.  &nbsp; And so was&nbsp; waking up next to him this morning. I had forgotten how wonderful it was to sleep next to someone, let alone someone who is smart and cute and an utter smartass and who thinks I'm beautiful.....&nbsp; Oh my. I think I'm twitterpated.

      I'm just getting ready to leave work. CT and MR are shut down, everything is locked up and cleaned up, and I walk through ICU to drop off a dirty towel when I hear that there's a dog that got squashed by a garage door coming in, and the neurologist will look at it. This means we may yet do another scan today. Dammit. I really wanted to go home. Ah well. Maybe it just needs steroids.

      I am in love with New Orleans. Not puppy love, either. Real, honest-to-god grown up love. I think it's the only city I've been in that's so custom made for a hedonist like me. &nbsp; Last fall, I went to the International Veterinary Emergency Critical Care Symposium. Which was in New Orleans. I had never been, and was quite excited to go. Originally I was going to go to Reno, but when Joel mentioned he was going to New Orleans, and I had never been there, I decided to go there. (He didn't, after all. Dork.) The bf couldn't get time off of work, so he didn't come with. Apparently I was supposed to have said if he couldn't go, I wouldn't, but I didn't know that. And I wanted to go. &nbsp; So anyway. The trip started out with the bf dropping me off at the airport after a bit of a fight, so I wasn't in the best of moods. But then I decided "Fuck it, I'm going to New Orleans, I'm gonna have a blast." And I did.  &nbsp; The greatest thing was, I think, the people. They were all so proud to show off their city to the newbie. And they all called me "baby", though it sounded more like "behbeh". They loved to tell me about restaurants, dishes, drinks, bars - everything. I got a free ride on a donkey-drawn wagon, from a guy who asked me out. I had alligator sausage, and ate waaaaay too much crawfish etoufee. I drank hurricanes and June Bugs and god only knows what else.&nbsp; And the music.... God. One night I just sat in a bar, in the corner, sipping a Sex on the Beach and listening to this amazing jazz quartet.  &nbsp; The day I had to leave, I checked out of my hotel early. It was a Sunday, so the streets of the Quarter were pretty empty, since everyone was sleeping off Bourbon St from the night before. It had rained, and steam was coming up off the cobblestones. A guy in a purple zoot suit was standing on the corner, playing soprano sax. It was like something out of the movies! I was entranced. I still use that memory when I'm doing yoga, to center. &nbsp; (B, you know this story already. Sorry.) I wandered the Quarter, picked up a beignet and hot chocolate (no coffee, thanks), and sat down in Jackson Square to people watch. After a little while, an obviously homeless guy came up to me. He introduced himself as Joe Hill. Repeatedly. With sound effects. Most involved "Pow!" and smacking his hands together. Joe asked me if I thought he was a good guy. I said I didn't know him, but I thought everyone had good in them. I then got a rather disjointed story about his kids, and custody, and a fistfight, punctuated by introductions and sound effects. He then asked me if I smoked crack at all. When I said no, he said "That's good! I just have some here I'm trying to get rid of." I guess I looked like as good a spot as any to dump crack..... Anyway. I declined, politely. Then his friend came over, looked at me and said "Do I know you?" I said I hadn't been in New Orleans before, so no. Then he asked "Do any of your relatives play football?" When I said no, he replied "Really? Because you have this big, solid look to you!" I wasn't sure what to say. I think he meant it as a compliment, but..... Sheesh! So I decided it was time for me to go. As I got up to leave, Joe grabbed my arm. He kissed his finger, and put it to my cheek. "Have a good life, okay? Don't end up like me." &nbsp; I was touched by that. A lot. Ironically, I saw him again before I left the city, punching a donkey in the head. Kinda tarnished the image, but at the same time put it in perspective, I guess. I still remember that, when I'm feeling sorry for myself. And hey, not everyone gets offered crack on a business trip.  &nbsp; I've set up a trip to go down there and interview for jobs, but I don't think I'm ready to move just yet. My Little (BB/BS) doesn't know if he's moving or not, and I'm not leaving him, so.... It may all have to wait. But&nbsp;New Orleans&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;going anywhere, so it's okay. Some days, it's all the happy thought I need.

      (Why are all my stories from Seattle?) One night, this big beautiful Bullmastiff named Otis came in because he couldn't walk. This is *never* a good thing. We were out of big cages, so he had a bed on the floor, since he wasn't going anywhere. Sometimes I just fall in love with dogs. Emma was one. Otis was another. I think it was his big squishy lips and enormous head. Anyway, I immediately loved him. I ate "lunch" (or whatever meal you eat at 3 am) with his head in my lap. And yes, I shared.  &nbsp; We started him on steroids, on the premise that he ruptured a disk and just needed the inflammation to subside. Sure enough, the next morning he was walking. Yay! His owners thought we worked a miracle. A few weeks later, Otis was back. Having trouble walking again, *and* he had started to seizure. Very not good. This time he stayed in our little side room for exotics and strays, with a baby gate. But I let him out to do treatments with me. He would follow me around, and when I stayed still for a few minutes would lie down and snooze until I moved on.&nbsp; And we shared lunch again. More steroids this time, which seemed to do the trick. &nbsp; The next time was bad. Otis came in, not walking at all. He was having more seizures. And he stopped eating. He didn't even want any of my lunch... It was time. His owners didn't want to come in, so it was just me and Adam, another excellent doc. We had some stray kittens in the little room, and Otis was really interested in them, so I got them out for him to play with. He slobbered all over them, wagged his tail, and nibbled a little food.  &nbsp; Adam gave me the option to not help, since he knew how attached I was, but I felt that since his owners weren't there, I should be. So I held his enormous head, whispered in his ear, and watched him get the juice. As he fell asleep, the last thing he did was turn his head and lick my face. I will never ever forget that. &nbsp; And that's why someday I will have a big brindle bullmastiff. But I don't think I'll be able to name him Otis.

      I've been listening to the Vagina Monologues in the car.&nbsp; I'm stunned. It's an amazing piece. I was fortunate enough to not have ended up with the hangups about sex and my body (well, except weight) that so many women have, and I still find it a powerful work. I cannot recommend it enough. Especially read by the author. She's amazing. &nbsp; Okay, not speechless. But pretty damn close, especially for me!

      It's Friday. Thank god. This week has been so freaking long, and I don't even know why. Well, except for massive hormone fluctuations.... But that can't explain all of it. Part of it is probably that I ended up working for 13 hours yesterday. Whee. Did a CSF tap, scrubbed into surgery, did a myelogram, CT, and anesthesia for another surgery, and got off work at about 7:45. This is why I need a different job if I'm going to go back to school. &nbsp; This weekend should be awesome. Tonight I'm going to a party with a "friend" (read: we're dating, but don't know what to call each other yet). Tomorrow I'm taking Emma to the city to hike (I don't get it either, but that's what Yolanda called it - hiking) with Yolanda, Quigley, and Lottie. Then I think I'm going to get my tattoo filled in, maybe. And then Cowboy Mouth is playing that night. So I'll be in the city all day.  &nbsp; And I'm guessing Sunday I will rest. I think I'll need it.

      My favoritest veterinarian in the whole wide world is Joel. He worked with me in Seattle. Joel is a BIG guy - 6'6 and 260, easily. And he's muscular big, not fat big. We started within about a month of each other at a day practice with an emergency service attached.  The first day we met, he was meeting everyone in the clinic. I was doing a dental or something, and then I heard this big rumbling voice behind me. I turned around to see a huge hand, attached to an enormous forearm, sticking out to shake my hand. I swear I did one of those cartoon things, looking up and up and up until I saw the cutest surfer boy face I could imagine! I was still scared I might lose my hand when he shook it, but I didn't.  A few days later he was working in ICU with me, and we just started talking. And we never stopped. And not just about work, though that was part of it. Everything. Just having moved. Family living far away, and disappointed in our career choices. Beer. All sorts of stuff. He even paid me the compliment of asking my opinion on cases sometimes, which is high praise indeed.  The (then) fiance and I found out we were moving about three months later. I took that opportunity to introduce the two of them. The fiance agreed that Joel was the nicest, most polite guy he had ever met, and decided he must be a serial killer or something. I think he was jealous.   I cried the day I left that hospital. Not because I would miss Seattle, but because I would miss Joel. He gave me the biggest, best hug in the world when I left. After we moved, we kept in touch. A phone call every couple of weeks, emails, all that good stuff. I don't hear from him often, but when I need him, he's there. I don't know what I'd do without him.  I was thinking of him today. Missing that voice, the looks we'd share when the medical director was a wench, working on a patient and doing *good* work, and sharing that pride. Yeah. The greatest vet in the world. And more. Stupid timing.

      Seattle is, needless to say, a land of coffee addicts. And not just Starbucks, oddly enough. Every hospital I worked in there had an espresso stand in the parking lot. And we (meaning the hospital) could have single handedly kept them in business, but that place was *always* busy! I never understood it. And you know how Home Depot has hot dog vendors near the entrance? In Seattle, they're espresso stands. No, really.   In college, my roommate's boyfriend worked as a barista for Sufficient Grounds, a coffee place in Toledo. He was always bringing home stuff for us, and I swear they made me try every drink in the place. Finally they got me hooked on chai tea, of all things. But it wasn't coffee, so it was okay. And italian sodas. I make those at home sometimes, Torani and club soda. Yum.

      -sober now, but still feeling damn good; must've been endorphins. or the frog pen.  -for all my talk of not opening up to people (read: men) right away, I'm doing it again. And I just can't convince myself that it's a bad thing. Life's too short to maybe miss out on good stuff because you're playing games. I think my heart might be the only thing I'm -- not fearless -- reckless? with.  -I hate that the morning national news spends a whole segment covering the Peterson trial, and the Bryant trial. You know, people who aren't rich and/or beautiful are living and dying all around the world. Cover that.  -I think sometimes I would sell my soul for a man who can cook and cuddles. And who understands why the news pissed me off, and why Emma is allowed on the bed, and why the idea of moving to New Orleans takes my breath away. Besides, my soul's going to hell anyway, so it's not going to do me much good.  -I'm addicted to exfoliation. And I'm out of special body wash. I think I may have to sit in the shower and rock, now.

      Must be the cure for all evils. Or at least all mine. After another date (this one I'll actually call that), and extensive cuddling, I'm feeling much better. Or maybe it's just endorphins. And booze. Probably all three. Though I seem to be very sensitive to those cuddling endorphins. I'm such a cuddle slut, really. And I'm proud!   I think maybe I drank too much to blog. I suspect I should go to sleep now. But I feel very nice. Yay!

      When I was in high school, I took all sorts of AP classes, because that was what nerds at our high school did. Senior year that included AP Government, which was a joke of a class. We spent the vast majority of our time playing "Jeopardy" with categories like Pop Culture, and The Electoral College. Whee.   One day we came in, and Mr. K (his real name far too long to spell or say) had a project for us. It was one of those apocalyptic-bomb-shelter-room-for-six-people-but-you-have-twelve-to-choose-from scenarios. All of the characters had pluses and minuses. There was the gorgeous blonde of breeding age, who was dumb as a rock. The farmer who was old. A woman and her son, and the woman wouldn't stay unless her son did. I don't remember the others, but you get the idea. Mom and son were  Roberta and Martin Lopez. Martin was not too bright and blind in one eye. (The project's description, not mine!!!) Roberta had useful skills (no, I don't remember what), and we knew she was fertile. So there was quite a discussion about whether we should keep them both or not. In fact, the discussion lasted into the next day. As I recall, we were leaning towards dumping them both.  As the day progressed, two of my classmates began a "Save Martin Lopez" campaign. They made posters, they plastered lockers with sticky notes, they harangued anyone and everyone about Martin, and how they would vote the next day. Honestly, I think we killed Martin AND Roberta off the next day, but Martin took on a life of his own.  Martin ran for sophomore class president that year. (Because we were a 10-12 high school, the sophomores voted the same year, rather than the one before.) We got the requisite 80 student signatures, and four teachers, all of whom thought Martin would be a great class prez. We made posters, promising a poolside lunch bar. (No, no pool, either.) When it came time to give the speeches, Martin was ill, so one of the seniors gave it. Sadly, Mr. K blew the whistle on that one, when it looked like Martin might win.  Martin applied for college. Martin went to math competitions. Martin was our mascot in everything that year. Sadly, Martin didn't graduate. We weren't able to slip his name in, since he was so well known.  I got an email from Martin when I was in college, in a particularly tough patch in my life. He reported that he had had eye surgery, and now had vision in both eyes, and that he was doing well, and hoped I was too. Another one of those undeserved karma things, I guess, but I was happy to hear from him.  And Yolanda here at work has a cousin named - Martin Lopez.

      I would believe in it, if it didn't so often not work out. Today is a case in point. My coworkers have been wonderfully supportive, and in a good way, too. Saying constructive things, not just reflexive knee jerk "he sucks" type stuff. They rock. I don't think I've earned it, really, but I'm grateful. Things like that are so humbling sometimes.  And Yolanda got us all really cool boxing frog pens, with bobble heads, and they light up when you write with them. It's the small things... I need to name mine, any suggestions? I will post his pic later.  Small joys, but so important. Thanks, guys. And thanks to you guys, for reading. Makes me feel less like I'm talking to myself...

      Amazing how caffeine can alter ones outlook on life. At the moment, I'm very nearly perky, despite about four hours of sleep...   One of my coworkers may have quit today. She left and took all her stuff, but didn't actually say she quit. I think they just need to dispense Prozac at the timeclock. Veterinary field workers are all freaking unbalanced.... No offense. I include myself in that!  On the bright side, the kitty with the brain tumor breathed for me the whole scan. Good kitty. Gotta take the small victories today.

      If it did, and then he did, you'd be better off without. And if he does, I'll find him and kick his ass for being stupid.  Ironically enough, you two keep me from being bitter. Watching the relationship grow (having been in enough to fill in the blanks) has been remotivating. And honed my purpose - I want *that*. Not something close. That. But in my size, of course.

      Is way gross. I keep getting this aftertaste. Yech. Thank god I have cookies and ice cream here....  My response to the ex was short and -- well, not sweet really. I made it in under fifty words. I'm so sick of this. Every time I think I'm done, I'm over it, I've moved on, something rips it all open and I have to start healing all over. I'm just so very tired of crying. God knows I've done my share. When do I get to get better?????  Fucking artichoke.

      The ex just emailed me. I've been accused of sounding like I currently have the emotional availability of an ice pop, and then been encouraged to respond. (In fifty words or less.)  It stings. A lot, dammit. Maybe because it could be true.

      While I was in Seattle, I worked an an emergency/critical care hospital. I worked as an ICU tech, which was really all we had, since we didn't have any specialists in the place. So by the time I came on, there were actually several other techs there, because 4-midnite or so was our busiest time.   So one night in July, I came in just in time to see someone bringing back a puppy. She was cute, red and black with floppy fuzzy ears and fluffy feet. She had fallen down the stairs and now wasn't using her right foreleg. So after the doc went in and talked to the owners, we got the okay for pain meds and xrays. She was such a good dog, even though she hurt, she yelped, but never offered to bite at all. We found out the poor thing's name was Baby D, which led my mom to later speculate that she threw herself down the stairs to get away.... Her xrays showed a nasty humeral break, with a couple different pieces broken off, and right near the growth plate, a bad spot in a puppy.  So we splinted her leg, with her owners complaining that it was "taking so long". I found that to be a little annoying, particularly after I explained that splinting the leg to reduce pain and swelling takes time, and they said "So?" So I went to discharge Baby D to her people, explaining about the splint and the pain meds she was going home on. They couldn't afford the surgeon who came in and did orthopedic work for us, but there was a day practice down the road whose owner loved to do orthopedics, so they were going there. As I gave them the bill, the man said "Two hundred dollars?" I don't have that kind of money!" Which surprised me, since they had initialed the box okaying emergency treatment up to 300 bucks. So I said "Well, we have to have *some* kind of payment before you can go" at which they offered five dollars. Needless to say, the doc didn't go for it.  So they left, promising to come back with the money tomorrow. And Baby D got to stay overnight. I took her out to potty, gave her happy drugs, and skritched her ears. She wagged her tail and licked my face. I fell in love. (Yes, it's that easy for me!) During rounds the next morning, we discussed the likelihood of her owners returning, and decided it was low. So I mentioned, casually, that I was interested in keeping her if they dumped her.   So I went home, slept all day, waited for the (then) fiance to come home. Said "Honey, there's a really really cute dog at work. She has a broken leg, her owners can't afford to fix it, and I don't think they're coming back for her." He knew me, knew where this was going, and said "We can't have a dog." I was bummed, but countered with "Well, can we at least fix her leg and then she can go to a shelter or something?" He did a little passive aggressive "Whatever you think is best, honey." Not a good idea on his part....  So I went in that night. Baby D was still there, with no word from her owners. More wagging, more kisses. More in love. I announced my intentions to fix the leg *and* keep the dog. Everyone was happy. Including Baby D. I started thinking of names. The doc suggested Emma, and I loved it. So did Emma. But she loved everything if I said it. Overwhelming, even from a dog.   So the surgeon came the next day and did the surgery. While knocking her down (Jargon!!), I saw her speckled tongue for the first time. More in love. "Sweet dreams, honey, I'll see you tonite." And off she went. I went home and stayed awake, by the phone, until they called to say it went well, no plates in the leg, just pins. Yay! That night, Emma was groggy, but already responding to her new name. Her orgy of wagging made my day! Every moment I had was spent at her cage, talking and skritching and falling in love more by the second.   That morning, after my shift, we went home. The bf, regretting his hasty words, had had to go with me the evening before for bowls, toys, crate, leash, and collar. So I had all the supplies. That first day I slept on the floor with my new baby, so smitten I could barely speak. When the bf came home, and saw us asleep on the floor, her leg all bandaged, already wagging at him, speckled tongue hanging out, he fell in love too. And we had an Emma.  And that's how I ended up with the best, cutest, most wonderful dog ever. I don't know what I would do without her.

      So, my work is fairly unique. It occurred to me to wonder today just how many animal-specific imaging techs there are in the country, and I'm guessing not many. I mean, there aren't that many places with imaging capabilities in the first place!   So a typical day for me is something like this.... I get to work, clock in, and go to the ICU area. There is an ER doc 24/7, but the specialists work M-F. The neurologist, whom I work with specifically, sees patients in the AM, and does procedures in the PM. Usually. So I go over to see what they've seen so far, and if anything needs a scan. We also take transfers from ER overnight, so they may need stuff too. Once I've looked there, I head back to surgery, to see if they have anything that may need scanned. The vast majority of our imaging is for neuro, but surgery does it's fair share.   Then, if there are scans, I go set up. In MRI, that involves making sure the anesthesia machine is set up and working, firing up the scanning software, warming up the monitoring equipment, and making sure we have enough O2. For CT, it's more warming up the machine and setting up the anesthesia. Once the animal's ready to go (pre-anesthetic bloodwork, xrays, catheter, all that good stuff) they come to the trailer (for MR, anyway). We give them some valium to make them happy and reduce seizures (why most of them are being scanned), and then use injectible anesthesia to "knock them down" (jargon, sorry!). Then we intubate them, start them on inhaled anesthesia, and hope they breathe. Ideally, they do. We have all sorts of nifty monitoring equipment, pulse ox and end-tidal CO2 and blood pressure. Then, the person doing anesthesia watches the dog's vitals while I set up the MR equipment. Then I start the scan. Which mostly involves pushing certain buttons in the right order. As the images come up, I transfer them to a PC inside for my boss to interpret. That said, I've gotten to where I'm not bad at reading them myself.... I can spot most brain tumors, some spinal cord lesions, and a blown intervertebral disc. Not that it matters.  I mention all this because I mostly feel like a trained monkey. None of my attempts to learn how to scan better, faster, whatever have been appreciated. My boss doesn't think I know anything, because I'm a girl and don't have any letters after my name. This is why I'm transferring departments. I'm tired of feeling like my skills are not only financially under-recognized, but also emotionally. I'm tired of waking up knowing that nothing I do will gain me praise, because I'm invisible. It's like that being a tech sometimes.   Oh, for pics of said workplace...  urlLink Animal Emergency and Critical Care Center . Whee.

      Since everyone else seems to be listing their romantic history, I thought I'd jump on the bandwagon....   My first boyfriend was Tom. Ahhh, eigth grade romance. Holding hands after lunch, kissing after school, groping at the dance. It was great. He broke up with me when his friends pointed out I wasn't very popular. He started dating some girl named Martha who lived far away, which made me laugh, once I stopped being hurt. I mean really, Martha? (Or so I told myself...)  Next was Brian. I fell hard, and vice versa. Smart, funny, incredibly cute, we were both smitten. But I panicked. I didn't really know how to handle feeling like that about someone, so I ended it. We split on not very good terms, which was unfortunate, as we had many mutual friends. Spent lots of time doing damage control and wondering why I felt so sad....  Then came Jason. Not really a boyfriend, but more a partner in lust. Older and cute, when he started paying attention to me I was flattered and overwhelmed. We started eating lunch together in the math teacher's classroom, and then started groping each other under the table at lunch. Tawdry, yes, but true. Things paused when he graduated and went to college, but would fire up later after a nasty breakup. At that point I had graduated, had my own place, all that good stuff. He would drive, after working two jobs, to come see me. It was wonderful for my ego, particularly since I still had the hugest crush in the world! And, frankly, the sex was amazing..... Ended when he got serious about a girl. I admit I sniffled a little when he told me he was engaged, but he's happily married, and I'm glad. He's a good guy.  Next was Josh. Younger, fellow theater geek. I loved his sense of humor and eclectic tastes, but he turned out to be fairly immature. (Imagine that, a high school guy being immature....) I spent a lot of time trying to change him, which was my mistake. I was great friends with his parents, and I think they would have been happy to have me as family, but it didn't work out that way. When I went away to school, he ended up flirting and then kissing some other girl. I could deal with that, if it didn't happen again. Then, at his graduation party (that *I* had done the cleaning and cooking for with his mom), he told me he loved the other girl, too. It was all downhill from there, I just didn't know it. No, I didn't want to see it. Anyway. He actually went to college very close to me, so things dragged on for a while. Lots of fights and crying on my part, yelling on his. Finally, it came down to I was good enough to fuck but not good enough to be his girlfriend. That was the final straw. This was the nasty break up Jason got me through. It was so great to really *feel* that I was that attractive to someone else, someone who wasn't treating me like shit. As far as I know, Josh is still living at home with his parents.   Next came the ex. He was amazing, cute, sweet, smart. Once again, I fell hard, but this time I jumped on it with both feet. He lived in New Jersey, and I drove the nine hours nearly every weekend to see him. Finally, I got tired of driving and just stayed. We did well for a long time, but we both let things slide that were important to us but the other person wasn't supplying. We drifted apart, and just couldn't seem to get it back together. Plus we both had (have?) our own issues to deal with that we weren't. So, all in all, it just didn't work. I think he's going to be one of those people I always love, always care about. Leaving was the hardest thing I have ever done, but I knew it was the right thing. That said, it got ugly, and thus all the missing stuff, but I just can't believe that was really him. We all do awful things when we're hurting that much, so I'm trying to get past it. Otherwise the hurt will eat me alive.  This isn't exhaustive, but it's the high points. There have been other flings, lots of kisses and flirting, guys I've wanted but couldn't have, and guys just at the wrong time. I'm finding, though, that my heart seems to be big enough to love more than one person. I can't decide if that means I give my heart too freely, or I'm just particularly blessed. Probably both.

      Sucks. I opened a new account with a certain bank on Saturday, because my previous financial institution is a) inconvenient and b) really rude. I think it's that PNW thing. Anyway... The guy who opened the account was hitting on me, everything went smoothly, deposited my paycheck, and away I went. Well, went to use the new card today at the grocery, and --- denied. WTF???? So I tried it as a debit card. Denied. ????? I was on the way to a friend's for dinner, so I just waited till I got home to call. Well, they're closed. So I decide to try online. They can't "verify my account." I may be finding another bank very soon, flirty tellers or not.  On the bright side, dinner was a sort-of date, and was quite nice. The gentleman in question is smart, funny, and wonderfully tall, which always makes my heart skip a little. We had a lot of excellent conversation, mostly involving politics and American Chopper. God I'm a geek. Not sure what will happen, but the company was good, and I'm always looking for good company. And he gives good hugs.

      I was randomly surfing the web today, and idly starting plugging names of old theater buddies into IMDb. Lo and behold,  urlLink  Tony  showed up! I had actually seen that before, but wasn't sure it was him. But now there's a picture, and sure enough, it's him!  Part of my excitement is because I had a huuuuuuuge crush on him in college. We did a show called Women of Troy, about what happens to the wives and sisters and daughters after Troy falls. Very powerful stuff. Anyway, he was one of our captors, and I had the pleasure of frequent byplay with him. He couldn't not have known I was hot for him, but nothing happened. Anyway..... Imagine my surprise a few years ago when I was watching Blind Date (a guilty pleasure, along with Cops and Cheaters), and there's Tony!!! I fell off the bed, I was so surprised. Anyway, she was a wench, and he deserved so much better.... Okay, so I'm still biased.   Anyway. He's got a picture under King of The Ants, there's a shot with three guys looking into the camera, he's the (uncredited) one on the left. I still think he's yummy, but he used to have better hair. Oh well.

      Without it, life would be so - isolated. I sit here, killing time, waiting to start brain surgery somewhere in the Chicago metro area, having read the thoughts of someone in Wisconsin about someone else in Missouri. Now, granted, it's an odd situation, but it's so good for me (and others, I would like to think) to hear new thoughts, ideas, and even better to hear mine echoed.   Timing is indeed everything. I am a firm believer that there is more than one person out there for everyone, and who is right depends on where you are in your life. Heart wrenching, yes, but that's the price you pay for caring. Wouldn't give it up for the world. Makes the sweeter that much better. And yes, that feeling of relativity come to life is the most wonderful thing in the world....

      So. Left late for work. Realized I forgot to change my AIM away message, so now I'll be in the shower all damn day. No breakfast. Tons of traffic. Despite all this, I'm in a pretty good mood, radio cranked and singing along at the top of my lungs. Then I get to work.....  Now, I really do love my work. (Notice I say work and not job. Big difference.) But sometimes the minuses are really crappy. Today I find out that my lateral boss (neurologist) is going to have to euthanize his dog. Now, we've taken care of her through all sorts of stuff, she's stayed with us when he went out of town, she's played with Emma and Quigs and Gator while they were all at work.... It's hard. So I'm spoiling the hell out of her. Being a lab, she's very, um, food motivated, so she's getting tons of cookies.  I guess it just reminds me that while you have to have a layer of toughness here, you have to remember that there's a whole life story in that human-animal bond. And just because we've only known them for a few minutes/days/whatever, someone has loved them much longer than that.   Love you, Hannah. Good girl.

      Amy, for her behavior of the past few weeks!! Whee. Spent some time thinking last night (which I hate doing, believe me. Thinking seems to wake the Beast....) and realized that I have had my priorities all wrong lately, and been an utter wench about it, too. So, to all of you reading (all two of you, hi Mom!), I am sorry. I'm sorry I've been irrational and cranky and judgemental. No excuse, really. I promise to try and do better.  To expound.... Since I split with the ex, I've been working hard to convince myself that I'm perfectly fine, nothing wrong with me at all. Obviously not the case, as I managed to get a six year relationship to blow in in less than twelve months. I've pretended that I don't miss anything about the whole relationship, that all is well with the world and nothing could be better. Soooo not the case. I miss things, yes. Not I-want-to-get-back-together things, just things. And I miss my stuff, I left sooooo much stuff, and every new thing just stings. Like my copy of Les Miserables. I almost told someone I would lend it to him, and I realized I don't have it. Or my Breyer horses.... I'm going to miss those. And my Star Wars figures, had those since I was seven. Damn.  Not just that, either. I'm pushy and bossy and totally holier-than-thou when it comes to work. (Thanks for pointing that out, I needed reminded!!) I'm often not as careful with men's hearts as I should be, letting them get attached when I'm not all that interested, and rationalizing it by saying "well, they know the rules". I am demanding and jealous and occaisionally bitter, though I try not to be. Sometimes I'm even successful.  So. I have been deliberately obtuse, which probably made for some awkward situations. I'm sorry. Don't doubt that my feelings were genuine, but I handled things poorly. Happy for you guys, really, it's been enlightening to watch the conversations - gives me something to look forward to! I've been looking for connections, when what I really crave at the moment is wild, hot monkey sex. With someone I can have a long, rambling conversation with afterwards.  But mostly I haven't been focusing on myself enough. While I have my balance back, I haven't gotten out of the habit of thinking about "my guy" first, which is part of what blew up that long term relationship in the first place. And I will *not* make that mistake again....   Great. Now I'm late. But needed to get all this off my chest. I am indeed sorry to everyone whose life I have made more complicated or less pleasant lately - I'm turning over a new leaf! Really!

      I am obsessed with this show, in part because it's neat to watch "shop". But more because two of the doctors I worked with in Seattle were on the show at various times. So I watch compulsively in case Andy or John are on. I have seen Andy - not at all. John - twice. And I've seen the show probably eight bazillion times. Sad.   Thinking about it, that was one of the early reality shows. Much more nicely edited, because you *never* see anyone getting puked on, or shit on, and that happens all the time. And nobody swears, which I just don't believe is the case. (Every tech and doc in the field I've ever known has cursed like a sailor...) But it's still nice to have something to point to when people ask what you do.

      Watched that the other night. Was slightly drunk, and thus terribly amused by gang names like "Dead Rabbits" and "Shirt Tails". Particularly since I remember, quite fondly, the ShirtTales cartoon... Actually, was amused by pretty much the whole movie. I don't think that was their intent, though. Seems like a lot of movies end up like that for me. Maybe I'm just an intellectual snob, but I think it's more that my sense of the ridiculous is just overwhelming.

      Well, maybe not quite random. We did a big ole workup on a dog today. He's an old, overweight (severely so) dog who is the mascot of an animal shelter. Really really really really sweet dog. Yesterday when he came in, it looked like he had a mass in his chest, which isn't at all unusual for an older dog, and suggests cancer, cancer that has spread. So we investigated what was going on in his chest before we did his myelogram and CT today. This shelter will have spent in the area of 2500 bucks on this dog before all is said and done, and that's *without* sugery...  Now, I think it's great that they feel this love and responsibility for this dog. That's great, really. But I can't help but think about all the young, healthy animals the shelter could feed and house for that same $2500. It's kinda sad.

      Stupid air conditioning in the stupid MRI.... If I didn't remember how hot it got last summer when the a/c out here broke (104 degrees, thank you very much), I'd be even more pissed about being here at six AM. My boss threw a temper tantrum when I said I was coming in, and didn't let him convince me not to be here. He's such a baby. It must be nice to always be right.   Forgot to mention that I spent a day and a half working on the network connection out here. Long story short, I was getting 25-50 percent packet loss on pings to the gateway, but everyone in the main building pinged it fine. So I finally decided (after changing IP addresses, gateways, DNS servers, the whole nine yards) that it must be hardware related. So I start swapping ethernet cables. No dice. That left the network card, or its connector. I suspect the latter. Anyway, swapped network cards and everything is peachy. I'm so proud! I confess I had lots of help from Ray the MRI guy, but still. And now I know a little bit more about networking.   Emma is donating blood today. We used a bunch on a hit by car dog that came in yesterday with an abdominal bleed and in shock. Plus there are several dogs with IMHA, which is when their immune system starts attacking its own red blood cells. So I think we expect to go through the blood we have pretty fast.  I need a vacation. I'm compulsively browsing expedia, looking for deals. New Orleans, here I come!

On one hand, it's really funny. But on the other, the implication is that the wife should have sex with the husband, whether she's feeling emotionally neglected or not. This is crap. And it's not like he would have okayed the shopping spree, had she had sex with him the night before....   I think too much. I really need to stop that.

      I can tell it's been a while since I worked out. My muscles informed me this morning that they were pissed off, and so I caved and just did some light stretching. Yoga tonight, probably.   Work is likely to suck, since a patient that always cancels didn't, and a patient scheduled for next Thursday showed up today. So we're up two procedures we didn't expect, plus the usual stuff. Whee.   I loved the rain last night. It helped me fall asleep, but sadly I still had trouble staying asleep. I think the animals have been restless. Ah well. That, or the insomnia is coming back. God, I hope not.

      I really like working in the surgery department. They work hard, but they play hard, too. And so many of their cases are orthopedic, ie basically healthy, just structurally unsound. They do well under anesthesia, they wake up nice, and they go home the next day.  I also like that I frequently feel useful. I know what they do, mostly, and thus can anticipate and be helpful. I can place catheters and draw blood and do recheck xrays and stuff, while the "real" techs scrub in for surgery and stuff like that. I actually feel like I help. I like that.  Oh, and one of the surgeons flirts with me. That's nice too. :)

      Last day before vacation!!!! Yay!!!!! Didn't sleep all that well last night. I'm seeing the reason for our "no overnights on work nights" rule, because I'm exhausted. Part of it - sleeping on the wrong side of the bed. What a creature of habit I am.  Oh well.  Good things: working with surgery today. That'll be fun, and keep me out of trouble. Probably. My August calendar picture is awesome. Michael Parkes, The Last Lion. Makes me happy just to look at it. My frog pen broke, but I fixed him. Simple pleasures, today.  Oh, and screw the food thing. I can't imagine how boring and annoying that must have been. Sorry!!!!

      I was really hoping to get out of here early today. We are done with everything. Except. The neurologist said he'd do a CT on a dog that's supposed to be here at 3:30. Or so. I guess they wanted to come at five, and he said they had to be here by four. So, we'll see when they actually show up. Figures. I really would have liked to have gone home and cleaned up the place. Oh well.

      So I'm getting pretty fed up with this place. I finally got my raise, which was not insubstantial. Well, for an hourly person anyway. But rather than it being retroactive to November, which was my anniversary date, it's only to June. Because last June they did adjustments for everyone, and I guess that was supposed to count as my raise. Assholes. So rather than the six or seven hundred dollar check it should have been, it will be much much much less.  I guess that wouldn't piss me off all that much, if I hadn't been explicitly told, by HR, that it would be retroactive to November. And she even mentioned that my last pay raise had been the adjustment, so she knew. She's such an idiot. I'll have to tell the story of my interview some time....  Anyway. I'm just disgusted with the whole deal. It's like a Dilbert cartoon, only worse, because there are about five pointy haired bosses. And it's not nearly as funny when it's live.

      Mike and I are still at that stage where if we don't see each other every night, we feel severely deprived. And since I got back so late from BBBS Monday, we just took the night off. So last night was ridiculously sappy sweet.... And I loved every minute of it! I can't help lauging at myself about it.  Oh, last night: Ate about half a pint of General Tso's chicken, and drank three beers. Today am working out, toning, and going to have a salad for breakfast. (have to eat it before it goes bad.

      So, one of my cousins is getting married in October. I'm terribly happy for him. I'm also terribly excited, because one of his college roommates also happened to be a goalkeeping coach at a soccer camp I went to. In fact, it's quite possible that they met because I told John (the roomie) about Jason (my cousin). Oh, and did I mention that I had a ginormous crush on John? Anyway. He's married, I'm smitten - but I still feel like being a hottie. Which leads me to: the project. Losing some weight. I have wanted to for a while, but motivation has been sorely lacking. I think this is just the spur I need.  The plan: make myself accountable to you guys. If I have to post my pathetic diet and lack of exercise, I'll be embarassed enough to actually eat well and work out. I think. Anyway, worth a shot. So.....  Day 1. Set alarm for 6:15, or so I thought. Apparently actually set the 7:15 one. No time to work out before work, but still managed to make time to go to McD's. Ugh. Bad Amy!! Anyway - sausage mcmuffin with egg, hash brown, diet coke. Rice krispie thank you treat from girl from yesterday whose dog has an awful tumor. Now I feel gross. But I've already drunk half a liter of water.  Yeah, that is embarassing. I think this may just work!!

        Got to finally talk to someone last night that I probably should have talked to long ago. Conversation was short, but sweet. And quite pleasant. We will have to do it again, soon.:)     My cousin in Afghanistan has come home. Thank god. He's going back to school to get his masters in aerospace engineering. Yeah, he's kinda bright. He's also going to be living (with his wife) very very close to my parents. I'm thrilled! Haven't seen him in years, but at least now he's safe.  I'm getting a raise, finally. After kicking and screaming that I hadn't had a performance review or raise since I started here, which is now 21 months ago, they finally caved. AND my raise will be retroactive to November, my anniversary date. Yay!!!!  I only have four days of work this week, before I go on a 'venture. Double yay!!!!   Random miscellany: My little sister is in marching band. (pauses for requisite band camp jokes) I saw some pics, and it's hard for me to believe my little munchkin is that grown up! I know, I sound old. I feel old.   Haven't test baked the cake yet. Maybe tonight. I'll keep you posted.   That's all for now. Carry on.

      Mary Kay Letourneau (sp?) is being released from prison either tonight or tomorrow. I am so grateful I don't have children, because she is one fucked up puppy. And knowing someone like her was out walking the streets would likely grow me another ulcer. Hell, it stresses me out anyway!  The sad thing is, it's not like I have an alternative. I don't think she should have been locked up for life, but I sure as hell don't think she's ever going to be "cured". I mean, the kid was TWELVE YEARS OLD!!!!!! And she had his baby!!!!!! What a freak. Her poor kids..... I dunno. It all just makes me ill.  And now this friend of hers on TV had the utter balls to compare her sleeping with this kid, to her speeding. When asked how she could do this to her kids, he said "Well, being a mother doesn't always have a connection to other parts of your life. It's like saying if someone is speeding and gets in a car accident, that they weren't thinking of their kids, and must not be a good mom." I think my brain just imploded from the sheer absurdity.  Oh, and she still wants a relationship with the kid, who's 21 now. Hopefully he's gotten some counseling in the meantime. In the words of Kyle and Stan, "Dude, this is some fucked up shit right here."

      Tonight was hard. Roller skating was humiliating, but that was to be expected, and not too traumatic. No, the hard part was that the place we skated was extraordinarily near the house. As in, I used to drive by the skate place every day on my way to work. I had this crazy urge to drive by the house, see my roses. Stop in and knock. See the ex. See what he's done with the place. Make sure he's doing okay. But I didn't.  I realized that there would be nothing to be gained by that. We're both finally starting to heal, no reason to open up old wounds. It would have been selfish as hell to just show up and throw his life into an uproar. But I still wanted to.  Oh, certain of you should check your okmail. We seem to have had similar thoughts independently the other day. :)

      Today has sucked. Not because things have been not working smoothly, which they haven't. Not because I'm ravenously hungry, which I am. But because I got to scan and see an enormous, inoperable brain tumor on a former coworker's dog. I hate that feeling. Bad enough when it's a stranger's dog. But when someone you like and respect is sobbing, because the they don't know if they should even wake the dog up, or send him on to heaven -- well, that sucks royally.  And we're likely going to diagnose horrible badness in a less than year old pug here in just second. I want a happy job. Like McDonalds.

      After I blogged last night, I called Joel. Haven't talked to him in forever, mostly because he's busy as hell, and the time difference can be a real bitch. In fact, it was the first time we actually talked since me and the ex split.  It meant to much to me to talk to him and hear him be nice and comforting and asking if I was doing okay. I've missed him terribly. His simple, genuine concern and kindness almost undid me. Amazing how something like that from a friend can just be overwhelming.  Thanks, babe. It meant a lot. Hope to talk to you again soon!

      So tonight is one of our two Big Brothers/Big Sisters meetings of the month. I got a call yesterday - it's going to be at a local roller skating rink. My initial reaction - dismay. I think the last time I went roller skating was about 13 years ago. And I didn't really like it then, either. Not to mention I'm worried about my knee. But I'm trying to put on a brave face and be optimistic. Maybe I've developed some mad skating skillz since then. I guess I'll find out!

      Pretty much says it all. I'm beat. Went to Quiggles' birthday party. It was an hour drive for me, down to the city, and when I got there - there was nobody I knew at the dog park. I was pissed. They showed up half an hour late. It's ninety odd degrees, mind you, I'm in a totally unfamiliar part of the city, and Emma was roasting. But I managed to smother my irritation, and give Quigs his present - a dog bone bigger than himself. I suspect he'll love it. (Emma, of course, got a toy too, because I can't buy something for another dog without getting something for her... So far she's ignored it.) After we played at the park for a while, we took the dogs to have birthday cake. Yes, there was a doggie birthday cake. Everyone had a piece. And party hats. Once I get the pics of that, I will post it - too too cute!!! Then we went back to the park for a while, but Emma was really hot, and once I noticed that when she was on the pavement, she kept picking up different feet (the pavement must've been hot) we decided to go home. Well, I decided. She panted in the back of the car the whole hour trip home. She's passed out on the couch right now.  After that, took a shower, did some laundry, and all that crap. Went over to Mike's. On the excellent advice of a friend, did my best to alter my attitude towards my foibles. Had limited success, but I'm still new at it, so I'm trying to be tolerant of myself. Had a long talk about my fears, and his perspective, and agreed to take things as they come. I think he's just humoring me, and is convinced that everything will be fine, but I know from personal experience that just being in love isn't enough. So, I guess we're humoring each other. Oh well. If I pretend long enough, maybe it'll sink in.  Came home, did more laundry, and am now getting ready for bed. Forgot to get a new guy shirt, and left the old one there, so I'm "alone" tonight. Ugh. I guess I'll break out the satin jammies and the teddy bear - next best thing. But I do finally have a fan for my bedroom. Yay!!!!  Short week next week - leaving for the Dells Friday AM. I can't wait......

      Last night was difficult. Pretty much because I made it so.  So I was making dinner before we went to see The Village. Tortellini, my recent fave. Heated up the sauce, the pasta was almost done -- and then I managed to knock the full dish of hot sauce off the counter. It was one of those slow-motion Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo moments, you know? It sucked. Splashed hot spaghetti sauce  everywhere . On me. On my new shirt. All across the kitchen, including the walls. And  ceiling . My computer, which lives on the breakfast bar.  I'm afraid I lost it. It's been a while since I lost my temper like that. A looooooong while. After screaming and hitting a few walls, I started cleaning up. Mike was taken aback, I think. No, I know. I'm on my hands and knees on the floor, crying and shaking with absolute rage. Not anger,  rage.  It scared me. So, once the worst of it was cleaned up, I threw my clothes in the washer and got in the shower. I had sauce in my hair, even. It was bad.  Once in the shower, all that rage turned inward, as usual. Standing there in the shower, sobbing, hating myself, I realized that I'm probably not ready for this whole serious relationship thing. I mean, I'm still damaged goods, you know? Mike kept saying "I'm not scared off", to which I replied "Then you aren't as smart as I think you are."  And I keep finding splatters of sauce this morning. I'm hoping it will be funny soon. Really hoping hard.  Oh, and the Village sucked ass. I fell asleep during it. Not recommended. Unless you're drunk. Then it might be okay.
