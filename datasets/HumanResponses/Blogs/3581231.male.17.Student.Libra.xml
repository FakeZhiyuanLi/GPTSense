      so, this is my first blog here.  this shit better be theraputic, cuz i'm led to believe that writting down thoughts is quite theraputic.  i'll give it a try.  more later though.  visit gillz.deviantart.com.  or any of deviantart.com.  lots of good stuff there.

      today was fun at first....but very very irritating at the end.  i basically did nothing all morning.  which was great.  i didn't want to.  my goal today was to do laundry, of which i did naught.  then i got a phone call.  it was from bethany.  did i want to run to waupaca and help put up "Luther Olsen for State Senate" signs?  sure.  why not?  so, we did.  we later find out that there is a get together happening tonight.  go out for pizza, then who-knows-what from there.  heres the thing.  i became very irritated right away.  immediately.  bethy and i had picked up matt, and were running late.  oh well, it happens.  so, we pull in to jaime's driveway.  first thing:  karl flips us off.  next, he starts grabbing his crotch.  finally (and through the rest of the night) he starts spouting off stupid shit.  it was almost non-stop.    you see, i was really hoping that i would actually be able to have fun.  the most fun i had was sitting in ripon, listening to a blues band (reverend raven and the chain smoking alter boys, to be exact), and watching the planes go by in the sky - on their way to eaa.  i had my mind on other things.  i could ponder.  and there was great background noise.  i would've been happy just sitting there all night.    nope.  we went to fox river days.  that was ok.  saw some friends of the fam i haven't seen in maybe 2 years.  basically, the rest was....well, not so fun.  so, we decide to leave.  but go where?  no one knew.  we finally decided to go to karl's for a bon fire.  well, bethy and i took josie to get her car.  karl, amanda, jaime, and matt went to harass some kids quick.  bethy and i went to my house so i could go home.  i had enough.  i like bethy.  and matt.  and jaime.  and joise.  and amanda.  and karl sometimes, too.  but tonight, it was just unbearable.  half of the original six of us (amanda was an add on at fox river days) were pissed at karl for being an ass all night.  bethy was pissy cuz matt was following karl like a puppy dog.  i was just pissy at karl.  i don't like being the person that is in a bad mood and is bringing the fun down.  but, i couldn't take it.  i   should've   blown up at karl.  but, i kept quiet.  i didn't want to ruin the fun, plus i rode with bethany, so i didn't want to inconvenience her.  but, truthfully, i'm just glad i'm home.  i don't see them having a good time.    quite frankly, if karl wants to be friendly to my face, but then irritate the hell out my while doing so, and then talking shit behind my back, he can take a flying fuck at a rolling donut.  and thats all there is to it....

      well, i figured that it was time to buckle down and actually write something substantial here.&nbsp; the only problem:&nbsp; what?&nbsp; i guess the thing is, i do all my blogging at da.&nbsp; so, i don't really have anything left for here.&nbsp; as i am writing this, i find the text to be very pleasing.&nbsp; so, there is lots for me to ponder over.&nbsp; to clue in, here is my wish list.    a relationship  different car  more money  a job  a good night's sleep  a relationship  not be living at home  that weird frustration feeling in my head to go away  a good relationship  and finally, a loving relationship.   i know, that sounds weird coming from me.&nbsp; you may query "gi?!&nbsp; sounding like a sap?!"&nbsp; but, the truth is this:&nbsp; yes - me sounding like a sap.&nbsp; even the most cold hearted bastards can look for a little affection.&nbsp; unfortunatly, where i'm looking doesn't lead me anywhere but into a confusing circle.&nbsp; i'm looking for answers, but all the clues are shrowded in mystery.&nbsp; i don't get any of it.&nbsp;   the really weird thing is that i'm supposed to get it.&nbsp; of all people,  i  should get it.&nbsp; when people need&nbsp;advice about people, i'm always there with that advice.&nbsp; i'm good at reading people.&nbsp; "if i know you, you have an answer for everything and are always very sure about everything."&nbsp; its true.&nbsp; i do have an answer for most of life's little challenges - whether its in my life or someone else's.&nbsp; and, yes, i am sure about most everything.&nbsp; i am a&nbsp;confident person.&nbsp; i can read people and situations very well - well, at least most of the time.   right now, i have no answers.&nbsp; i'm not confident.&nbsp; its not a side of me that people see.&nbsp;  ever .&nbsp; i'm not weak.&nbsp; i don't pretend to be.&nbsp; people see me as hardcore, unapproachable, distant, uncompassionate, unemotional, an asshole....the list goes on.&nbsp; some of that truly is me.&nbsp; and some of it is a facade.   in my life, i've learned that the only way to not get screwed over is to be those things.&nbsp; but, in the end, i'm only screwing myself over.&nbsp; to put up that facade is to put up a brick wall around you.&nbsp; you don't let anyone get close to you; no one ever knows the real you.&nbsp; its unfortuanate.&nbsp; then you've separated and/or alienated yourself from all of your friends.   because of this separation, i sit back and watch the world of my friends.&nbsp; i'm just barely in their world....kinda clutching at the very limits.&nbsp; i see them evolving into different people, i see them making new friends and letting go of&nbsp;others.&nbsp; i see the mistakes they are about to make.&nbsp; then, i'm there to help - if needed - when the mistake has been made.&nbsp; but, i don't want to be clutching on; there to bat clean up.&nbsp; but, the thing is, i've tried so hard to push everyone away that i've actually succeeded.&nbsp; except for a few people.&nbsp; and i consider them to be my closest and best friends.&nbsp; they know who they are.&nbsp; they're always there for me.&nbsp; and i appreciate that so much.&nbsp;   in the end, i'm looking for a good, long, lasting, loving, decent, relationship.&nbsp; i don't know where to find that exactly.&nbsp; i have a start, but thats where the confusing circles start.&nbsp; the shrowd of mystery needs to come off.&nbsp; i need a sign.&nbsp; i&nbsp;need someone to point it out to me.&nbsp; i need that special someone in my life.&nbsp; i need her to just let me know.&nbsp; i need, i need, i need.....

      so, its been established that i like this girl.  but, there are a few things that are weighing on my mind:  1)  we've many mutual friends.  what is there reaction going to be?  will it be well receieved?  or is it going to make things weird?  i guess it doesn't really matter.  that would be a minor thing, and they can get over it.  2) most importantly, what happens if things don't go well?  what if it results in a horribly bitter break up?  then everything is ruined?  we can't be friends?  i certainly don't want that.  but, i think it is something i might have to chance.  maybe things will work out really well.  i mean, its possible to be together for ever.  my aunt has been dating the same guy for over 30 years.  who knows.  its something for me to think about.  but i think that, given the risks, its something that has to be moved forward with.  best of luck to me, i guess.  now my only problem is the actual asking....hmph.

      i'm pissed.  we're moving.  when?  hell if i know.  where?  middle of fucking nowhere.  the whole thing is idiotic.  why are we moving?  cuz sue got a hair up her ass and now she thinks that we need to move.  god forbid we'd live anywhere for a decade.  i have lived in five houses in my life.    "its a place where we'll spend the rest of our lives."  no you won't.  no you   fucking won't  .  its all going to be a cob job, not well thought out, and everyone is going to be pissed in the end.  especially me.  "you only have another year at home, so your opinion doesn't count."  how about this opinion:  jump up your ass and poke your head through your neck.  or this:  take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut.  or this:  fuck off.    if you can't tell, i get pissed everytime the subject comes up.  this is going to be an uphill battle for them, from me.  it won't be pleasant for anyone involved....

      i speak about relationships   alot   in my blog.  they weigh on my mind quite a bit.  when i have thinking time, they are what i'm normally thinking about.  but, i'm not infatuated with them.  *insert segue to relationship discussion.....now.*  there is a distinct difference between infatuation and love.  infatuation is a strong, obsessive, lust.  love, on the other hand, is an attraction of the mind, body, and spirit.  very different.  people are a very infatuative species.  look at fads.  they come, they go, and are forgotten.  same thing in relationships.    i'm not going to say that only girls infatuate over guys.  not true.  guys do it as well.  but, i will say that girls are more prone to do it than guys are.  at least from what i've seen.  this is the point at which i insert my opinions and observations of what girls do in this situation.  from the view point of a guy.  sometimes, girls find a guy whom they like.  then, they start spending all of their time together, talking about each other constantly, calling eachother all of the time, its like they are twins.  so, they go out for a while, and something goes horribly wrong.  he dumps her.  she is devestated.  she is crying all of the time.  depressed.  moody.  eventually she starts to feel better.  then, right when you think everything is ok....it starts all over!    its just a viscious cycle.  it may happen once.  or it may happen repeatedly.  i don't understand it.    right now, i like this girl.  i'm not infatuated with her.  why not?  i wouldn't want to rush into something and have it blow up in my face.  anywho.  i like this girl.  i don't know if she knows, but i kinda have a feeling that she might.  sometimes i get a reciprocating vibe.  but, i don't know.  everything is confusing and shrouded in mystery.  i wish she would just say something to me.  let me know any little way.  it would make things so much easier in the end....

      Significant others.  the most challenging part of life.  as a species, we are supposed to find a mate and have a kid.  as higher thinking beings, its so much harder than that.  sure, pretty much all animals go through some sort of selection process to find a mate.  people are no exception.  but, once we've found one its so easy to find a reason to move on.  they way they do their hair.  an obnoxious laugh.  they're a mobster....whatever.  and in today's society, there is such a pressure to find a mate and get married that fools rush in and then things end up going to hell in a handbasket.  a handbasket much like what i picture little red riding hood carrying, i might add.  i'll admit, i don't have the most experience or the best luck with relationships.  but, somehow, i have an ability to guide other people through   their   relationships.  have a question?  come to me.  i might be able to help.  i don't know why i am able to help.  and i'll gladly admit that i'm no expert by any means.  but, i feel that growing up with three sisters has helped me understand people better.  maybe its part natural....maybe i don't really care where it came from that much.  enough about it.  so, i can help you but not me.  ok.  i'm not the "Great Communicator" aka Ronald Reagan.  give me a speech to write, i'll knock your socks off.  tell me that i have to have a one to one with my girlfriend, i'll tell you to fuck yourself.  i know what i have to say and do.  but, its bringing myself to say or do that thing that is the kicker.  on the other hand, i can tell you what to do or say in your own little predicament and convince you that doing it is the right thing.  the difference:  you'll do it, i won't.    here is my other problem:  i don't like to take chances.  i do not like to ask a girl out unless i   know   that we share the same feelings for eachother.  even at that, i may have to find a way to ask the question without having to be there in person.  this is something that i will have to work out on my own.  it is these two things that cripple me.  i don't like to take that initial chance and i don't always communicate well.  but, as time goes on i get better.  there will be a time when i have no issue with either.  that time just won't be in the immediate future.  so enough about my own problems.  lets talk about other couples.  there are a lot of couples in the world.  there are a lot of couples in my immediate circle of friends.  good for all of them - they all seem very happy together.  each couple is completely different from the next.  they have different traits, different styles, everything.  its awesome.  its fun to watch.  its fun to try to guess what will happen with them down the road.    sometimes i wonder what they are thinking.  about eachother.  about the relationship.  about what other people think about them.  about the rumors.  about whatever it is they think about.  i don't know why.  maybe its because i like to see happy couples.  why do i like happy couples?  i'm not exactly sure.  i think it may be because it fills an empty void - part of me that lacks a relationship with that right loving person.    thats right.  even i have a void in my life.  a good chunk of my time goes to thinking about my ideal girl - my ideal realtionship.  someone funny, likes to laugh, good personality, doesn't take things too seriously, fun to be with, likes music, nature, and dogs.  someone i can curl up with on the couch on a cold winter night and watch a movie....or not watch that movie....;)  it doesn't seem like too much to ask for.  but, then again, it probably is.  otherwise, i would have found it, right?    you see, my problem is the fact that i've made friends with too many girls.  been there for them, held a conversation, have some sort of friendly history.  then, they are unsure about being more than friends.  "what if things get screwed up?  what if we can't be friends?" they think.  true.  i wouldn't want to loose that friend.   here is the problem with girls:  they beat around the bush.  they play a game where they confuse the hell out of guys til we dont' know what they are thinking.  the whole time they're interested, of course.  but, we're not supposed to know.  then they get pissy or depressed when he doesn't say anything.  to any girls reading this:  be honest and forthcoming about your feelings with a guy.  he'll never get it otherwise....   maybe my only chance is to find someone outside of berlin.  or wait til college.  but, those don't sound like good options to me.  i'm looking for something now.  if there is someone out there reading this right now, see the previous paragraph and let me know.  who knows where things could lead to....

      parents.  hmph.  who really needs them?  well, all of us.  what do we owe them?  well, everything.  clearly if it weren't for them, we wouldn't be here.  and if we were, then we'd be living on the streets.  and who wants that?  now that i'm past the admittance, i begin.  i feel that there are three types of parents.  those who have a real relationship with their kids, those who don't because they are too busy working, and those who don't because they just don't give a damn.  my sister and i feel that we come from type the second.  there is lots of background there, but i'm not about to delve into it here.  i believe at one point i have mentioned it on da.  check past blogs there.  gillz.deviantart.com.  if you have parents in the frist group, good for you.  that means you generally get along, have fun, laugh, confide, etc.  you're being raised to be a good parent yourself.  applause for you.  but, i'm not here to talk to you.  you don't have the parental issues that the rest of us deal with.    lets start with the last group of parents.  these people are the ones with the screwed up kids.  always wearing black, into trouble, sitting at the round tables in teh back of the commons.  you know who i'm talking about.  it is a toss up on how their life will turn out.  its unfortunate.  if the parents actually tried to care every so often, maybe their kids wouldn't turn out to be punks and freaks.    the situation that i am most familiar with is the middle one.  parents who have little or no relationship with their kids because they are always working.  it is noble that they are working to support their families.  i cannot find fault in that.  but, i do have a problem when work is brought home.    you see, in my house, my parents didn't just set aside an hour to talk about work.  no.  they started when they got home.  that was the topic at the dinner table.  after dinner they rambled on some more.  they concluded their night with more work.  it was just never ending.  little time was made for us kids.  sure, they went to the school functions.  we even took that trip up north for a week each year.  but, those token moments don't add up to much.  the lack of their presence outweighed whatever time they were there.  i don't want to make it sound like they were only around for school things and going to the lake.  there were more times.  i don't really remember them though.  ok, we went out to eat every friday night.  dad and i would go to deer camp in the fall.  we took two vacations in montana to see friends.   i'd like to quote Peggy Noonan - author of    When Character was King  , a biography of Ronald Reagan.  ....and there is more, of course.  there is the great sadness of the politacal life, which is the great sin of all persons of intense ambition.  robert lincoln didn't always speak of his father, abraham, with great affection, and didn't much like his mother.  FDR wasn't really an attentive father, eleanor a fairly unusual mother.  robert kennedy loved his children so much he would kiss their hands as they walked by, but when the choice came between bringing them up in an air of relative calm after their uncle's assassination or gambling himself for the presidency -- in a dangerous time when they were killing people like Jack and MLK, Jr., and Medgar Evans -- he gambled, and ran.  And he too of course was killed, leaving ten children to be brought up by an overwhelmed mother in a home marked by loss.  Washington is full of people who work at the office late and go in on saturdays and sundays to prepare and argue over child-friendly welfare bills and child-friendly education initiatives and Head Start programs and reading programs for impoverished children.  they are doing good work at HHS and the DoE and in the OEOB.  it is work that is important to our country.  and sometimes at their desks they think of their own children and look up and promise themselves, "next week we'll go on a picnic, or to a ball game."  and their children are home watching tv or pushing a rock with a stick in the driveway thinking, "where's dad?  where's mom?"  washington, of course, isn't the only city this applies to, nor people in politics the only professionals.  my son has pushed that rock with a stick.  maybe yours has too.  this is what professional amibition does:  it takes you into the world and away from your family.  you can make a lot of people's lives better that way, but you can make the lives of those around you worse.  it's one of the great traps, the great strains of trying to make the world better, and i don't mean that ironically....  so, that passage is what i'm trying to sum up about parents.  no kid wants to be that rock pusher.  and no parent wants to come home to see their kids pushing that rock.  my parents have that professional ambition.  and good for them.  but, if you are going to be a professional, learn to balance your time.  i  hope that i can be a professional and a family man at the same time.  i don't ever want to see my kids pushing a rock while waiting for me....  my next entry:  significant others.  that should be fun.  i've been waiting a long to to blog about that.

      Crazy Ranting. thats how i started this damn thing last night. then my computer got shut off. here are the basics: i was bitching about karl. see previous entries. i don't remember the material. it was good. thats all i know. anywho....now for thoughtful blogging.  so, i had been writing to my public *ahem* aobut relationships. friendships, parents, and significant others. then i lost it all. so, i decided that, in order to possibly make things more thoughtful and meaningful, i would do this in installments. with my handy dandy outline in hand (yes, an outline. i had to remember what i needed to say somehow....), i begin.  friends. some have them, some don't. i feel that i have enough to fill all my fingers and both thumbs. maybe add some toes in there, too. if i'm using my body as an abicus, then i can have up to 21 friends.  i would hope to have more than that though.    it seems to me that the most dynamic aspect of high school, and life for that matter, is friendship. they change constantly. add more, subtract some, try to erase some from your memory, what have you.  over the years, i have seen relationships change.  my own and others'.  it has been an interesting process.  mistakes have been made - for good and bad.  it may be a fluke that you become friends with a person, but that person may become your best mistake ever.  or your worst nightmare.  look at it how you will on a case by case basis.    i feel that throughout my life, i have been careful about choosing my friends.  i don't like to get screwed over, so there is a major trust issue that i have to get over before i can click with a person.  because of this, my friend base has grown slowly over time.  my tendency is to start out as a mere acquaintance.  over time, depending on the situation, friendship ensues.  i feel that this is the best way to make sure that you don't get screwed.  i don't want to sound like i've never been in that situation.  i've made a few unfortunate mistakes.  things were terminated.  i've moved on.  i'm just like that....  i've seen my fair share of people get screwed by others.  obsessiveness between friends leads to a superficial friendship more often than not.  i do know of people who spend all their time together and are best of friends - always will be.  on the other hand (there are more fingers), the superficiality eventually leads to cracks in the relationship.  hurt feelings ensue, and a nasty bitterness starts to separate.  sometimes, things can be reconciled.  others, its just not possible.    not only have a seen this happen several times, i've predicted it.  then, i became a middleman.  friend of both sides.  what to do?  stay neutral.  don't talk bad about either side to the other.  let them vent.  things will cool down eventually, so let it run its course.    it really is unfortunate when things end up like that.  there is an old saying:  make new friends, but keep the old.  one is silver, the other:  gold.  but, because that is mushy - and mushy isn't me - i look at it this way:  walk softly and carry a big stick.  that way, you can tell who is and who isn't truly your friend.  good night everybody!  stay tuned for tomorrow's episode:  parents.
