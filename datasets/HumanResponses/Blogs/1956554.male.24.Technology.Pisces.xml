       urlLink http://sourceforge.net/projects/editorviewer/   urlLink http://www.eclipse-plugins.info/eclipse/plugin_details.jsp?id=540   "This Eclipse Plugin "EditorViewer" provides a view of all open editors within Eclipse. The goal is to provide as many of the same features of the "Navigator" plugin provided with the base Eclipse install. Currently Eclipse presents the list of open editors via the use of tabs, while useful if only a few files are open, the names on those tabs quickly become useless/unreadable as more and more editors are open. This plugin aims to provide a means to clearly access the open editors regardless of the number as well as provide convenient functionality for those editors such as comparison and team functions."  This is a very nice plugin.. It corrects one of the few irritant factors in Eclipse. This is the beauty of the Eclipse's plugin architecture, one does not need to wait for the next release of the product, anyone can build a plugin for the small/big feature that he believes will make Eclipse a better place to live.

      "Version 0.5  urlLink Log4E  is an Eclipse Plugin which helps you to set up your logger easily in Java Projects. It assists you in several tasks: logger declaration, logger Inserts at certain method entries, replacements of System out's, modification of already existing logger statements.  "  This should be a useful plugin for projects which are using Log4J. This confirms the belief that people should just use the standard APIs available without building wrappers over it, unless your requirement is really different. I am not sure it was smart of Indigo to build its own wrappers for Logging.

       You are currently using 1 MB (0%) of your 1000000 MB.   This is the message I see on my Gmail inbox page. Yeah ok.. You can count the zeroes again. Is this a mistake ?  or is this a masterstroke from Google. When I heard for the first time about this 1 GB mail service from Google, I thought, they could actually make it “unlimited space” since very few people will even use up 1GB. Moreover, if someone really wants to upload 10GB, then he will just open 10 different accounts. Lets wait to get confirmation over this.

      Look at my previous post about the StaticMethodNullObjectConfusion class example where a null object is used to invoke a static class without causing a NullPointerException.  It is now that I completely understand how it works.   It works since the binding of which method to call for nullObj.someStaticMethod(); happens at compilation time and not at Runtime. That is why it does not matter that the value assigned to the nullObj is null. It will be interesting to see the results of this class's compilation using some ByteCode viewer tool. When Jimmy has some time I will ask him to join me this.

       urlLink The Java IAQ   Nice set of java questions here.  One that  surprised  :-O me:   public class StaticMethodNullObjectConfusion { 	public static void someStaticMethod() { 		System.out.println("someStaticMethod called"); 	} 	 	public static void main(String args[]) { 		StaticMethodNullObjectConfusion nullObj = null; 		nullObj.someStaticMethod(); 		System.out.println("look maa!!, No NullPointerException"); 	} }    The above main method runs without causing a NullPointerException, since while executing a static method only the type of the object being used for the call is considered and its value is ignored.

       Read this rediff story today. Tribal kills his mother for sacrifice to a diety.  urlLink [1]     It makes me feel sick to know that people can be so senseless. How can someone kill ones own mother ? Just a few days ago there was another story where some guy killed a neighbour's kid for sacrifice. I feel as sorry for the guy who killed his mother as much as for the lady herself. He would really be believing that doing such a horrible thing would bring benifit to him.   <> Somehow basic education needs to spread to all sections of our society. Only that can stop people acting this dumb.

      Hey     I cleared the SCJD exam today. Got the results back from Sun within less than a week from submission.   I have scored  86% , I am not happy with the score, but then I lost most of the points in the Locking section which is the most controversial. Whatever it is, its fine.    Here is the full Report card.   Sun Certified Developer for the Java 2 Platform (310-027) Date Taken: 2004-07-17 13:21:30.560 Registration Number: kbcsyd5193 Site: iid68 Grade: 	P Score: 345  Comment: This report shows the total 1.4 SCJD points that could have been awarded in each section, and the actual number of points you were awarded. This is provided to give you per-section feedback on your strengths.   The maximum possible score is 400;  the minimum to pass is 320.   General Considerations (maximum = 100): 94  Documentation (maximum = 70): 70  O-O Design (maximum = 30): 17  GUI (maximum = 40): 40  Locking (maximum = 80): 44  Data store (maximum = 40): 40  Network server (maximum = 40): 40 Total (maximum = 400): 345     I should thank  Jimmy ,  Latha ,  Nidhi  and  Matira . These guys helped me a lot in testing out the application. Given the score I have got I would maybe have flunked if I had not got a good score on the GUI section.  Thanks  Jimmy  for making my GUI good.
