I can still feel his lips on the lower portion of my left eye.  yeah. that is where his first kiss landed. uhuh. but he just skyrockted in my heart.

      Ah, John. This would be my vow to you...  “There is no room in my body for anything but you. My arms love you; my knees shake with blind affection. My mind begs you to ask it something so it can obey.”   Thanks Buttercup, or should I say William Goldman =)

      I am scared, and at the same time excited about the things going on in my life. I really don’t know which emotion to hang on to. Especially with regards to this great guy.  He is such a wonderful person. A very pleasant surprise.  But I have to play this one coolly. Think things through. But gawd! He is so much wonderful. And our conversations keep playing in my head like a sweet lullaby.  Oh dear john…

Jen and I always made a pact that we'll see where this thing is going. 'I'm not sure it really is in our nature to be with someone the rest of our lives, just because you made this pact. 'You keep going as long as you keep growing. When that dies, we do.' But he adds: 'Just when you think you've gotten all you can out of it, you get knocked upside the head. It's good fun.'"

      I can feel the stick in my heart. At past 4 in the morning, I awoke sensing the something dreadful will come my way. And I was correct. I had my heart pierced, left vulnerable to a deluge of never-ending pain. He just spoke two words and these were enough to extinguish the glow from my face, the optimism in my life. “My honey…” Why do I have to always play the second best? Why can’t I be the only one?
