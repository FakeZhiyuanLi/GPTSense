        Yesterdae was my Prelim oral. I don't tink I did well.. wells.. I gt Mrs Redwan for my eng oral! When I peeped in2 de exam rm, I almost fainted. I've been dreading her.. N wells, the ting tt I dread 4 came true. I've gt her 4 oral! I was lyk thinking, "Oh my gud! How m I gonna survive?". But she was veri friendly to me. Which made me less nervous. But nevertheless, she is a strict teacher! Heard tt from Ixora gurls. Damn fierce.. But veri nice to Hibiscus gurls (My class!) when we go dere for moral ed. Mayb she was juz acting.. Hu noes? For chinese, I gt soon kueh! My own chi. teacher!!! Its ridiculous isn't it? Fancy getting yr own chi teacher 4 oral.
