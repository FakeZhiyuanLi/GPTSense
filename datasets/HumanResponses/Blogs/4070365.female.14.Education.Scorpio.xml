      Well, This is especially for gerls! have u even thinks that u like this guy and expects him to like u back?It will NEVER come true...*maybe*.Well, let me tell u something... When a gerls likes a boy the boy surely runs away from her or ignores her.. He will think bad about this gerl and will tell his friends about it!~ And sooner than u think, Ur personal love life will be Gossips!~ They didnt know how much u love them and they didnt care...So what is love?? Love is something to make u more stress then ever...There are good times but mostly most of them are bad!~ People everywhere will talk about our reactions...And maybe your parents may find out about ur love life. The more u love them the more they hate u...The more u come closer they more they try to run away..They more u talk about them, the more people gossips about u...and The more he tinks u're a jerk! So all u have to do is dont believe in love! Well, I Dont!!Remember Love doesnt exist for boiz all they know is to enjoy!~
