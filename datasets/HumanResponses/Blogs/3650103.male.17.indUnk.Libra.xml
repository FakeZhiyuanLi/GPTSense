      Well, following my recent breakup with my tru love, Nicole, I have gotten back into the game.  I had forgotten how hard it is to get a date.  This is like that thing where as soon as I get a girl everyone wants me all at once, but as soon as I'm single no one even wants to speak to me.  I hope I don't seem like a dick or something.  Maybe girls see a ghetto white boy and just think he's slangin' and smokin' and ain't no good kind of man.  I'll never really know what it is.  I guess I might as well get used to being alone again.  Any Juggalettes that live in the Columbus, GA area holla at me.  Just e-mail me and I'll be sure to get back at'cha.    hoodlym_lilninja@yahoo.com

      I have had a long deliberation and I have decided that it bestt if I don't come home for a while.  My Mother doesn't seem to trust me even as far as she could throw Yokozuna.  In this sense my life would be living Hell if I stayed at her house.  I could move down after I have enough money to get my own place adnd I'm 18.  This might take some time seeing as how my Mom has my car is not giving it back, leaving me the only option to buy another vehicle.  And if I'm throwing money into a car savings I can't save for a place to live.  I regret that I can not be there for Nicole, but I think I have made my mind up.  It's been 3 months since we've seen each other and we only stayed together on the hope that I'd be home soon.  I think the best thing would be for us to see other people at this distance since it will be some time before I get home.  I can't afford school right now.  I plan to attend school here in the Fall.  The school isn't bad and yet again I am here, away from my Mom.  Besides, where my Mother fails to support me emotionally, mentally, and financially my Grandmother succeeds.   I'm sorry Nicole.

      I realized earlier tonight while I was talkin' to Nicole (my gurl) that she makes me happier than I have been in a very long time.  It doesn't seem to matter that we aren't physically together.  Just talkin to her everday makes our relationship that much better.  I feel like with every word that is spoken that we grow closer and stronger.  She calls me her Superman and that's all I ever want to be for her.  She won't let me buy her anything and she wants to do everything by herself, but I just want to be there to do it for her.  Even if we're so far apart I want to be her Superman every second of every day.  I know even more every day that it truly is love.  They say that you're allowed three good women in your life.  She's my third which means I've got to make it last.  If I fuck this one up I don't know what I'd do.  I pray to God that He gives me the strength to keep our love as strong as it has been up till now, together or apart.  "One Great Favor" -Lil' Ninja These feelings I feel have got to come out, Have got to come down, 'Cuz no matter how many times I've been around, Not a greater love, have I found, I dedicate these words to you, If only I could give, the world to you, I just want, to grow old with you, 'Cuz you was there, when I was still wearin' baby blue, Throwin' 'round signs actin' a crazy fool, And I pray that the Lord will do, Me one great favor, maybe two, Bring my baby back, and make it you.  --  Even though I have my second, family, My Hoodlymz can never replace, what you could be, And even now as we stand apart, I can see, That the Lord still fills, my heart with glee, He calms my pain, and lets me breathe, Maybe you will wear that platinum ring, Our world, used to be, one big fling, Now it's time to settle down, let Heaven sing, Of two, love is a beautiful thing, And I pray that the Lord will do, Me one great favor, maybe two, Bring my baby back, and make it you.  I love you baby.

      All I strive for is inpedendence.  I feel like America and my grandparents are England.  She says I can't go out because - 1. We have company coming this weekend.  - Fuck company, they don't wanna spend 24/7 with me while I sit around the house bored in my room writin' raps and tryin' to draw a meaningful sketch. 2. She can't take me and I don't have a car.  - Fuck me not having a car.  I have people to get rides from.  Just because she can't take me doesn't mean I can't get to where I wanna be. 3. They are responsible for me.  - Fuck that.  Just because they are responsible for me doesn't mean that if they don't deliver me personally to my destination that they are being irresponsible.  All I wanna do is go hang out at the arcade/club with the few people I do know here.  Yea, I'm a ex-crack addict, that doesn't mean if she doesn't watch me every second of every day that I'm smokin'.  Maybe she just can't let go.  I haven't worked for 2 1/2 weeks, but I don't wanna find another job just because my boss is out of town right now.  I get paid good doin' somethin' I enjoy doin' and I don't wanna learn somethin' else and get paid less.  All this stress is bearing down on me hard.  I tried to put all my cards on the table and when I did she (my Grandma) just backs away because she knows I'm too old to listen to her bullshit any longer.  Because I strive for independence I can't seem to get any without fighting till my knuckles are bleeding and my face is red.  My inner feelings and thoughts are fighting to get out and they are going to force their way though my pores eventually and when they do I don't wanna be in the room with myself.

      It would take too long to inform you on everything that's going on in my life; much less everthing that goes through my head. So, here's the basic outline.  *My girl's name is Nicole.  It's currently a long distance relationship.  We met in Strickland Youth Center in Mobile, AL. I love you baby!  *I live with my grandparents at the moment.  My Mother lives in Mobile, AL.  *I know no one here.  Except family and they don't count.  *I'm a Juggalo.  If you don't know what I mean by that you don't deserve to know.  *I'm a Hoodlym.  The Hoodlymz are my homies, excuse me - my family, and they are in Mobile also.  Here or there I'll be throwin' 'H' signs and wearin' baby blue till I die.  Shout outs to Klip, P.C., T-Bear, Bone, 40 oz., Lil' Ray Ray, and Bri.  Hoodlymz 4 Life.  *I attempt to rhyme.  I figure the more I practice, the more chance I have to let the world hear my message.  *I write and draw.  Maybe some of my stuff will make it here.  *My life may not seem that intense, but I won't lie, things go South more often than they go right.  And everything seems fuck up as soon I try to fix it.  I tend to attempt things that I know I can't accomplish and when I fail I get even more depressed than usual.  I try to live by one simple philosphy: "Fuck the world.  You can't please them so do what you gotta do.  Fuck the world."  I hope this paints a picture to get you started.  I hope you follow me.  Feel free to comment at will, if you have any questions I'll try to answer them to the best of my abilities.    Holla.   "Fuck the world.  You can't please them so do what you gotta do.  Fuck the world."

      And once again the cycle begins to move.&nbsp; Brittany and I are talking and she is really crazy about me.&nbsp; Lisa&nbsp;has my hat still and I haven't even spoken to her yet on the phone.&nbsp; And I work with Tanya, she's playin hard to get.  Brittany wants to be with me and she's great, but I really need to date for a little while before I commit to anything.&nbsp; I think that's best right now.&nbsp; I don't want to hurt Brit, but that's the decision I've made and I'm stickin to it.  I haven't called Elizabeth in a while because I don't know when she works and usually by the time I wake up in the afternoon she's gone.&nbsp; I haven't updated in a while because of work and being social.  I stayed out all night last night with Terrell chillin.&nbsp; My Grandma freaked and Mom called my PO and I'm waiting on my Grandpa to get back with the drug test.&nbsp; Even though I know I'm gonna pass I still get nervous.  I kinda lost Tanya's number at some point last night and I can't call her like I told her I would.&nbsp; I guess I'll go see her at work tonight,&nbsp;even though I don't work,&nbsp;and tell her what happened so she doesn't think I'm totally unreliable.&nbsp; I was supposed to give her a ride Monday morning and I fell asleep.&nbsp; I feel like I'm gonna ruin something before I have it.  Maybe Brit will read this and be upset, but there's nothing I can do about that.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is what I'm gonna do for right now and that's that.  Holla, Lil' Ninja

      I've been talkin to my ex girlfriend Elizabeth here lately.&nbsp; She lives in Huntsville and we broke up because I wasn't comin there and a knew I wasn't and instead of calling her I just stopped calling.&nbsp; I ran away. &nbsp; Whether I move there later or not she's back in my life for good and I'm grateful. &nbsp; This changes nothing between myself and Dani.&nbsp; We are together and nothing short of Hell freezing over is gonna break us up, but a huge void in my soul has been filled where Liz was. &nbsp; p.s.

      The past few entries have been somewhat depressing, I'm not sure that I really have a lot to be depressed about tho. This is my life as of current.  Dani and I are still together and we are very happy with one another.  The word 'love' may have already been used, I'm still not sure if it was premature. The relationship is starting to lose it's 'new car smell' and is becoming an everyday thing.  I found myself a j-o-b and I go in for training on next Tuesday. This in turn means I get my car back. ^_^  Tori's b-day is coming up fast and Dale, her boyfriend, and I are working hard to throw a good party for her.  He and I are going to rap some ICP for everyone.  Faygo showers all around.  I'm keeping in touch better with my Hoodz.  My Mom will be here and my two brothers will be spending the weekend next week.  Sibling fun!  NOT!  My stress level has decreased tremendously over the past few days and I feel the weight of the world lifting from my shoulders.  The boy down the street from Dani is starting shit and I really don't want to go to county for beating the hell outta some punkass thirteen year old, but if he wants to push his luck all he's gonna get from lady luck is my fist in his face and my RBK's in his ass.  Well, as of right now this is my life.  Pretty fun, eh?  Yea right!  Holla!   Copyright 2004 Wicked Clownz inc. "Swingin' hatchets since 1996"

      The world constantly pulls me down, People always wrench me down into the pit just as I reach the rim, Love always leaves me as soon as I give into it, Someone will always lie to me no matter how much I trust them, I can chase my dreams forever and a day and yet they always remain an inch away, Why must I try so hard to be just me and be accepted, Nothing ever truly changes in this life, No matter how hard I believe in something it'll never fulfill my prayers, Things in this world that are worth having are taken and stealing is illegal, No matter how broken my heart is I'll never learn my lesson, It doesn't matter if I scream it from a mountaintop my voice will never be heard, Even if I had a million followers I'd never anything more than just me and not a single one of them would truly know me, Believers don't make something real no matter how hard they kneel, I can't win the battle against myself even if I had a bullet, No one escapes death and everyone runs from it, Fuck it.  -Lil' Ninja

       People hate me cause I'm a good person. People hate me cause I believe in something. People hate me cause I know a thing called love. People hate me cause I'm a white boy with gangsta wishes. People hate me cause I know right from wrong.    Because I know left from right. People hate me cause I stand tall and don't take shit. People love me cause I stand for them. People love me for all the reasons that they hate me, too. Fuck the world and it's bullshit. People hate me cause I dress better than them. People hate me cause I look sexier than them. People hate me cause I got dreams of livin' large and I'm chasin' 'em. People hate me cause I tell it the way it is. People hate me cause I know the importance of self.    Because I know the necessity of companionship. People hate me cause I'm loud and obnoxious. People love me cause I speak for them. People love me for all the reasons they hate me, too. Fuck the world and all it's hate.  But most of all, Fuck you!  -Lil'Ninja --To tha hataz.

      One more day has passed and it has been of mixed emotions.  I'm tired of takin people's shit.  I hate to be told no when there is no reason for the denial.  I love being with Dani.  We spent a little while together tonight and I have yet to show her my real skillz -if you know what I mean- .  I talked to Bri tonight.  It was a little unexpected but it was pleasant.  It inspired the post below.  Hoodz niggaz don't die!  I drew for the first time tonight in a while.  I haven't really be mused by anything lately.  Maybe Dani is my muse.  Today was crazy.  If you're one of my Hoodz you can check the shout outs below.  If you're not you can familiarize yourself with them so that when I refer to them you can know i little bit about who they are.  Holla.

      Being away from people really makes you realize how much you really miss them. My Hoodz were always there for me when I needed them to be and even when  didn't want help they beat the help into my hard help. I just wanna take a few minutes to give my shout outs.  Bri a.k.a. Thorn a.k.a Hood Queen - You's my gurl.  You turned normal, now we turn you ghetto.  Raini a.k.a. Lil' Ray Ray - You changed and I don't even know you anymore.  David was like a plague that killed your personality.  Shane a.k.a. Klip a.k.a. Hood King - Lay off the bud man, you gonna give yourself asthma.  Alex a.k.a. Pussy Crook (P.C.) - Get outta Strickland and stop hittin that nasty ass pussy.  Sammie a.k.a. Bone a.k.a. Hood Prince - Keep it real and kick some prep ass for me while I'm away and throw the H in their face while they bleed on the pavement.  Justin a.k.a. T-Bear - Stay tru dawg and I'll see you when I see you.  Oreo - I know we haven't met but hold it down for all the homies.  Kyle a.k.a. Roach - Quit stealin all the Hoodz so we can party in town sometime, damn.  Terry a.k.a. 40 oz. - You my boy, don't take any shit from Brandy.  Boyz over bitches.

      Is age just a number, When happiness is a factor, Does a few years matter, If it causes a heart, to shatter, to be pulled-dragged-ripped apart, Should everything revolve around age as a ratio to maturity, If the other's heart, mind, and body cantain immeasurable purity, If two share a mutual attraction, Why it seen to an infraction, upon ethics, Does it matter who one picks, if they aren't exactly the same age? "Just a Number" -Lil' Ninja  Tonight after I took Dani home my Grandmother and myself got into an argument about Dani's age and mine.  I don't really care what she says, Dani makes me happy and that's all that matters to me in the end.  I don't care that there's a 4 year age gap.  She is mature enough for me and I love being with her.  It shouldn't matter if there was a bigger gap.  She's a teenager and she can make her own decisions, I'm a man in my own right and I can make decisions too.  And my decision is her.

      Once again it's Friday and I am going to do my usual.  Only this time around its different.  This time I have someone.  I don't have to just stand around like a fool playing video games and hangin with the guys.  I got a woman.  I propose a toast. *Raise Glass* To Friday's with someone special, not just a night full of tostosterone.

      Well, everything has been straightened out and I can now be with Dani.  It's a great feeling to not have anything to worry about, no stress, and yet I can't quite get used to it.  This feeling of security is so foreign that I'm not sure its real.  Now ends a period of loneliness and a period, hopefully a long period, of companionship begins.   Commencement indeed.

      So I get caught up in the bullshit of life again.  I meet a new gurl.  Megan.  I meet her friend.  Dani.  I fall for the friend.  Wrench in the works.  I don't know what to do.  Dilemma.  I want nothing more than to tell Megan that I've fallen for her friend and that she and I aren't working.  But I don't want to lose her friendship.  Dani, I'm not sure if she's going to say "Yes." to me and her.  Praying.

      I'm not sure who I am, but I know that I like being me.  No one else seems to like me though.  Especially not the people that make decisions.  I'm a Juggalo.  Swingin' my hatchet.  I'm a Hoodlym.  Throwin' up H's.  I'm a thug.  Wearin' baby blue.  I'm a Ninja.  Sneak up behind ya and snatch your bitch.  I'm a little backward by the world's perspective and they spare no expense to let me know.  I'm like an Uh-Oh Oreo, white on the outside and black on the inside. I've spent my time in the ghetto and I'd go back in second.  I've spent my time chillin' with pimps and drug dealers, even did a little bit of that myself. I've smoked blunts with niggaz that would shoot and punk bitch that even thought about comin around. Now, I'm straight flyin.  Not fuckin' with trick hoes or touchin' bud.  The bub calls to me sometimes and I fight back with two fists.  This is me bein' me and even though I do things right they always end up wrong in someone's eyes.  So if you don't like me for me then this is my official statement to all you haters who hate the playa and the game, who hate me cuz I dress better and look better than you, who hate cuz I got gurlz hangin from my ankles prayin' to get a look their way, who hate me for me and ain't happy with yourselves...  ...FUCK YOU!!

      So, there's this girl and she's amazing.  She is everything I ever wanted in a woman.  She makes me smile and we have a lot of the same opinions.  She is the sister of one of my good friends.  When I told him tonight that I liked his sister he told me he could tell and that I was pretty obvious.  Now, I feel like a dork.  So, there's this girl and she has a boyfriend already.  She smiles at me and everything bad is made good and everything that's gone wrong in my life doesn't even matter.  She is like a living ray of sunshine, but someone has already stolen that sunshine away and it is night eternal.  Now, I feel like a dreamer.  So, there's this girl and she seems so far away.  She is too perfect to chase.  It feels like running a marathon in my head whenever I think about what to say, a marathon that goes in a circle and has only a start.  She is like a deer, beautiful, but I dare not go too close for fear of scaring her away.  Words that say what i wish to never escape my throat, they simply choke my heart and shatter it to pieces.  Now, I feel like a fool.  So, there's this girl and her name is Jaime.

      I'm a playa and I'm tired of playin.  I'm tired of spittin game, I just wanna tell the truth.  And I could care less if I get them in their birthday suits.  There are only four girls in life truly and honestly that I can see myself with. Nicole Dani Tori Elizabeth  Nicole and Elizabeth are too far away from me.  Dani is too young for me.  Tori's Mom doesn't like me.  I'm just shit outta luck.  Let a playa play.  But what if he's tired of playin?

      It's been a week or so since my last post.  I've been working midnight shift at Steak-n-Shake waiting tables.  So if any fly honeys wanna come by and say 'Hey.' come on through.  Dani and I have been spending some time together.  Thomas wants to be back with her but, alas, she doesn't want to be with him.  Andrea and I have been talking.  She's great.  She's beautiful, out-going, and is a lot of fun to be around.  And to top it all off I think she genunely wants to be with me.  Now, to get past her parents so we can see each other.  Brooke broke up with her boyfriend to go out with me, but neglected to tell me.  Brittany and I were dating at the time and it kinda hurt Brooke.  But I am never even going to consider going out with Brittany again, maybe we can be friends, but after what she did to me...  Well, I'll have to give you the 411 some other time.  To keep it short she's a lying chicken-shit.  But as far as Brooke is concerned I'm available!  School starts officially for everyone tomorrow.  But its all gravy 'cause I'm asleep while everyone else is in school.  I am off probation ass of yesterday.  Fuckin' sweet!.  So, as you can see, some things have changed and some things will never change.  Holla.
