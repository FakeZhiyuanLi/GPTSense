      it's wednesday.  my sister's friend erica and her son hector came to visit today.  i lived with them and rented their house in philly last year.  they told me stories about people i knew there.  loretta is a mutual friend who eventually bought the house on south 5th.  she wears cat-eye glasses and plastic flowers on matching 50's dresses, owns a streamline trailer home, and is a tough-cookie bar-tender.  the first job i got in philly was at beau monde, where she works.  then a week later, i got a second part-time job at modern eye, and it turned out she worked there too.  so she thought i was stalking her for a while.  anyway, apparently she was at a party and had packed away a few martinis when she went up to a woman with crooked glasses and offered to adjust them.  the woman gratefully accepted, and then loretta, master optician, accidently snapped the glasses in half.  the woman was furious and said loretta would have to pay for them.  chris, the optometrist we worked for, was there.  "i told you not to do that, loretta," he chuckled.  this amused me because i got a lot of shit whenever i broke someone's glasses (which only happened a couple of times, mind you!)  oh, second-hand stories.  i went on a date last night.  it was pretty fun, we had ice cream and talked for a while at some bar downtown.  he's very nice.  but there wasn't much of a spark, i have to say, except in a friendly way.  it made me think about what i want from a boy, which is, in this order:  intense sexual attraction (mutual), outgoingness (because i can barely entertain myself, much less people who are more shy than i), obsession of some kind (music, film, art), self-obsession (it's easier to be obsessed with someone who's obsessed with himself), bad-boy streak (promiscuity or fucked-up world view -- i feel uncomfortable around people who are too PC), and a healthy balance of intelect and frivolity/materiality/absurdity.  overall this guy scored pretty high, so i want to see him agian, but lacked some of those guilty pleasure qualities.  first impressions can be misleading though.  i cleaned my room yesterday.  so satisfying.  i have a pretty awesome pad at my sister's house.  i should have more people over.  especially of the male variety.  henrietta (my puppy) is lying on the wood floor.  i'm listening to the animal collective, who are playing a show with black dice later this month.  it's like the only good show going on this month.  austin is supposed to be such a happening hub of musical mayhem, but no.  maybe i just don't know where the house shows are going on.     i wonder if anybody is reading this.  i haven't told anyone about it.     ••••••••••••••

      I've always wanted to write a novel in blog.  And actually post it, au fur et a measure.  It's about a teenage girl with one arm who has trouble in school and with meeting boys.  She's a typical girl, with typical tastes and valley girl spazz writing style.  She builds up a romance in her head with a boy she meets online, and then when she finally meets him in person, he gets freaked out about her missing arm and disses her.  She gets really depressed and starts talking dirty with another guy on instant messenger, but insists that they never meet in person.  He asks if he can send her a letter, and she stupidly gives him her address. He shows up when she's at home alone after school and rapes her.  It's kindof inspired by Gide's Pastoral Symphony, in part.  Maybe I'll do that one day...  Today I returned some of Lorelei's library books (the local branch is super-weird:  big sign that reads "AMERICANA" in 1950's italic lettering above the more to-the-point one that says "Austin Public Library" and bright green George Jetson-style drop off boxes.)  I also went to SAVERS and spent a lot of money I don't have on:  2 blazers, pants, t-shirts, paper-shredder, vangaurd suitcase (nice!), mugs/glasses, and an old nun doll that opens her frightening blue glassy eyes when you sit her up.  Woody Harrelson's caterer came over and brought us (my sister and me) a delicious RAW meal:  raw bread crackers with cashew spread, salad with apples and dried sour cherries in a balsamic-maple vinegrette, zuccini pasta with sundried tomato marinara, and dehydrated oatmeal cookies.  I feel so CLEAN.  We watched the end of Magnolia.  Sorry, but watching over-paid actors pant and yip out a painfully self-indulgent pomo script just doesn't get me off.  I'm listening to the Fiery Furnaces right now.  Didn't like them at first, but they're growing on me.  I made some shorts the other day.  The first thing I've ever sewn (since home ec in junior hi).  They're bermuda shorts with male bodybuilders posing on sunny beaches printed on them.  What else have I done lately...  I saw (only in part because my vision was obstructed by large texans standing in front of me holding their obese white children on their shoulders) the H2Hos: a feminist water ballet troupe.  The definitive kitsch austin experience.  Saw a bunch of people I used to work with @ bookpeople, including a girl who was in the show.  That reminds me, I haven't been swimming in a while.  I won't be going to San Francisco after all.  Instead I have to use my airline miles to go to my cousin's wedding.  In South Dakota.  Why do straight people have to interfere with MY VACATION?!  Oh well.  He's three days older (or younger?) than me and has some sort of french fiancé.   Now I see how people end up writing so much on these nonsensical things.   BYE.
