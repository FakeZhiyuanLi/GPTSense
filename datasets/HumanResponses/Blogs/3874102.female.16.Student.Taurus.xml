      I was in a really really good mood. i even offered to stay 3 extra hours at work. i do that all the time. they ask me to stay and the nice person i am i do. I dont want to anymore. im tired of being treated like a lesser person then them its not fair. i didnt do anything. i do my job and im nice to them. but some of them just treat me like im a inferior person. im so tired of that, everyone thinks there better then me. my manager would yell at me at anything i asked. or give me looks of hate. i asked for my break and she got all mad. then 2 minutes before the time i said id stay tell i asked who was taking my place i got yelled at in front of everyone "you still have 2 minutes and ill put someone back there so get back there!" then she turns and continues to talk to her friend that had come in, and becca gave me snide remarks and laughed. im sorry, i do recall that i was supposed to get off 3 hours prior to this but i stayed for you bitch. its like they enjoy humiliating me. beccas always saying things like "no one cares what you think or say" i hate my job. they made me cry. i hate them
