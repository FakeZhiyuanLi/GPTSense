      The begining of my posts and hopefully not the end, let's start with the past.  About 6 years ago I was in 6th grade. Meeting new people and not really caring to notice anything because I was only 10-11 at the time. We sat at our tables the first day of school, and I was pleased to notice that I was sitting by my best friend. No familiar faces but his were at our table, Next to me, a rather "tough" yet soft kid with red hair, and a temper to boot. Across the way was someone I'd met before but hardly remembered, next to her, a fellow math-liker, also a she. At the far end was a large young man, probably older than the rest of us, who later would leave and never be seen again after 6th grade. Between my across-neighbor and the disappearing man, is the lefter...but at the time, she was the writer.  Ending it brief, the story shall unfold quickly as my mind twists away from the roots that have held me at bay for so many years.

      It's tonight of the day I created this, and I've an urge to continue where I left you. Moving forward in time a year, friends are found and lost, I venture into a new land, Junior High.  Simple but sweet, 7th grade flies by without much to bother with. Meeting new people, and reuniting with some old, gaining friends, and losing friends. The lefter and the writer become closer and have gained a much stronger friendship over the next year. As that age comes to a close and the next year is upon us, trouble begins to brew.  I'm in yearbook this year, and a new friend has joined the league. One you will become quite acquainted with if you continue to follow me. We become good friends and the year moves slow. Still good friends with the lefter, this new friend and I come to a wall. Before I can explain what happens, I must tell of something far more important first. About half way through the 8th grade year, the writer began to feel something. As if a weight were tied to the bottom of my heart, each time I would see the lefter, the weight increased in size. As time pressed, the weight became unbearable, yet it wasn't pain, it was joy. What the feelings were was not discovered untill confrontation about this matter with another close friend, a friend who I've kept, and who has helped me. Whether it be lust, love, admiration, or some other silly way of caring for someone, didn't matter, the fact was, it was there.  The very base of the mountain that is about to engulf the writers life, I end it here for another post, another night.
