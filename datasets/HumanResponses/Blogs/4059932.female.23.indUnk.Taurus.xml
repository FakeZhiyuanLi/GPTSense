       ..tho i'm stuck ere in da office, early in da mornin wit quite a lot of stuff 2 do, i still keep my excitement growing each & every minute! Its saturday &amp; da  mega sale  has juz started & i juz got my pay 4 dis month.. increased 1 dat is *wink* (thanx ayah! :D).. Are all dis signs sayin dat i shud go crazy over da discounted clothes &amp; shop till i drop? Hmm.. i'll try my best not 2 overspend by bringing only enuff cash 4 d necessary things (long-sleeved & sleeveless tops + 2 sandles (black &amp; white).. & of course FOOD (yummy!). I have to really control my eagerness 2 spend dis time, cuz i've a lot of bills 2 settle for; Convo Fees (yea, i'm graduating on da  Aug 28, 2004 in UiTM Shah Alam (morn session)  *hint hint*, as well as my tailor made kebaya that cost me RM 220 for juz a plain design! *urghh*. Lucky thing i dun have 2 pay for my soon-to-be motorola h/p :D, cuz its kinna like a gift fr my parents for graduating & gettin a gud result 4 my degree + being a well-behaved daughter! Yea i made them proud.. always have.. &amp; i'm glad i did cuz they've been a great parents all dis while, for makin sure all our (da children) needs r fulfilled juz 2 c us succeed in life.. *sigh* i neva failed 2 get wat i wanted, really.. Now i'm being emotional.. Thanx ayah.. mummy.. thanx for pamperin &amp; spoilin us hehe *kidding* ..ure da best!

        I've thot long b4 i worked 4 my dad, dat life wud b dull & boring.. da thing dat add color 2 it is only MONEY.. &amp; i was definitely rite, all along. Yea i am money-minded as much as havin a joyful life.. but truth is, i cant haf both. I dun think i only speak 4 myself, but dis may represent every workin ppl in dis universe. But maybe.. juz maybe.. it doesnt apply 2 ppl who didnt haf dat much frens & haf da same interest of fun by chillin with their frens / hommies.. like i do. &amp; they r juz used 2 live in their own world, wit their own hobbies, along wit their own peepz (if any). Changes juz dun occur 2 them.. as it does 4 me.. *sigh* Yea livin like dis (makin frens wit da pc, otha collegues, clients, daddy's fwens/partners) has definitely makin me miserable at times.. especially wen i'm back home after work or during dinner time, wen i'm stuck at home wit no food 2 eat cuz i'll b too lazy 2 join my parents 4 dinner at da usual places; Vicchudda, Santai or D'Tandoor.. d only day dat i'll look forward 2 is da weekends. Dis is wen all my frens & my boy will b around *Yay*.. but dis seems 2 b da shortest time of da week 4 me, after a seem-2-b long weekdays of waiting 4 it 2 come by.. I hate 2 start da blog wit dis sad story of my life.. but its da truth.. its da reality of my world now.. tho  reality bites but life goes on so live it 2 da fullest!..my fav motto  & dis is d only reason dat keeps me alive each &amp; every day :D
