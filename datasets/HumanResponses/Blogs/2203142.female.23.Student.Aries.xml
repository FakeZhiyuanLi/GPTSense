      Ok I thought since I have blogged one of Beenish's articles I might as well tell whom she is.   She's been my friend since matric (that's equal to junior high or o levels in Pakistan). That was 1995. Wow! Long time girl! Anyway, she's my best bud and she' in her 2nd year of LLB. She's done BA in Law and Political Science. Two years left to become a full fledged lawyer. And like the rest of us, she might also decide to go for an MA LLB from UK or some place. I hope she would.

      Beenish happens to be my best friend. Hey Beens!!! She's becoming a lawyer. Yes sir! She's gonna fight for our rights one of these days. Here's a really great article she wrote. She sent it to all of us and thought I'd put it on my blog because it's really informative. Haven't edited it in anyway so here it is in its entirity.  1.  Misconceptions:   There has been a misconception and confusion regarding rape and its relation to another sexual crime, adultery.  The confusion connecting rape and adultery should not exist as both are two different crimes and their circumstances and punishments cannot be the same. They are not looked at them as the same nor given an equal treatment in Submission (Islam). The need for four witnesses in case of adultery when no other evidence exists does not apply in cases of rape where modern science allows the use of advanced techniques to identify the rapist with the highest accuracy. The victims of rape, if they notify the authority immediately, will have enough proofs to convict most, if not all the accused rapists, as the physical facts including semen, saliva, blood, hair, fibers, skin scraps, bite marks...etc. are so many and easy to identify to convict the rapist. There is no truth to the claimed rumor that the rape victim has to present four witnesses to prove the rape when there are so many other physical proofs. This requirement is needed only if a person who has no other proof accused an un-expected person of such a crime. In our modern society, no one will be convicted with any proof or any person can accuse any person at any time with no proof and gets away with it. Islam is justice, for both the victim and the accused. The least of the proofs is eyewitness, and God sees to it that the four witnesses (who do not have to be men), will be a better guarantee against a deliberate plot to scheme an innocent person. The wrong application and/or understanding of the Quranic law related to rape in Submission (Islam) is but a reflection of the desertion of these so called "Islamic" countries" to the law of the Quran in favor for their man made laws, or corrupted religious laws originated from sources other than the Quran. Anti Islamic campaigners try to take advantage of these wrong application of the law and to slander Submission (Islam) in the eyes of the ignorant public who do not educate themselves about the true nature of Islam.  As clearly its written in 24:15, “ You fabricated with your own tongues and the rest of you repeated it with your mouths without a proof. You thought it was simple, when it was according to God, gross”. In this ayah…  A} ‘Rest of you repeated’…meaning a person who accuses someone for the penalty of hadd ( 100 lashes ,if not married , if married stoning to death in public place) he can easily bring 3 witnesses along with him , who may lie ! .  B} ‘without a proof’ …certainly not talking about witnesses but some other proof , might be medical examination (  DNA test in relation to male/female whether it was concent or rape) .These days you can even tell from hairs ,blood,clothes and can pinpoint the real rapist .Theres no need of witnesses anyway.Because if you examine Medical test of someone , the result will be the same by all doctors ,  all over the world .  C} ‘simple’  …God clearly says ..if accusations were that easy , everyone could have then accused and brought 4 witnesses ,who may lie, / certainly this is not very simple !  For those who still believe more ayaat should be given to them ,so , according to this ayat 49:6 ,   “o you who believe, if a wicked person brings news to you, you shall first investigate, lest you commit injustice towards Some people out of ignorance, then become sorry for what you have done” In this ayat as well,   A} the word investigate…………., surely Science today ! How can the Judge investigate whether witnesses are lieing or telling the truth ?  God can not be cruel to innocent people ???   …or can HE ?    ….  B} Wicked peron brings news     ……can be any person  …can be a liar   ….brings news to you  ….. can be any news ….theft news …any allegations ….or   falsely accusing someone with the offence of Hadd  by simply bringing witnesses ..etc who are liars as well  .  C} ‘lest you commit Injustice” ……….. you commit ….maybe referring to Society …or Pious men  ….or Qazi  ..or Modern day Judge ……… Injustice…we can relate it to jarga system …or Courts etc   PAKISTANI LAWS ON ZINA  ( how stupid) Proof of zina or zina-bil-jabr liable to HADD( provision 8,VII Hadood Ordinance 1979:  “   …….b) .   at least 4 muslim MALE  adult witnesses, about whom the court is satisfied, having regard to the requirements of tazkiyah-al-shuhood, that they are truthful persons and abstain from mjor sins ,give evidence as eye witnesses of the act of penetration necessary to the offence: ………….For non muslims …non muslim witnesses .  *****  there is no ayat in Quran which says that you must bring along 4 adult MALE MUSLIMS         …..Quran says … ‘witnesses” it can be male, female , muslims and non muslims as well  ….and the reason being because Islamic society  or the base of Islamic state is to give rights to every citizen living in an Islamic state and one more thing in every country     or in every Islamic state , MISTAKE of law is no excuse !!  Quran is for everyone ,muslims and non muslims ….suppose if this Provision was right …… 2 people commited zina in reality ….the third person did see them as eye witness along with 3 other people, 2 of them were muslim females and one non male muslim ( total 4 people) How can we bring the two people who commited ZINA to justice…when we fail to produce 4 MALE MUSLIMS according to HADOOD LAWS  ………. ????????   anyone can commit ZINA …if there are non muslims and female muslim living in their locality ….even when they know they did the act of zina ….?     In this ordinance , if you produce 4 adult male muslim  against anyone , the defendant is liable for 100 lashes , (even if he/she hs not commited zina ) This is not certainly our RELIGION, this is a stupid PROVISION in PAKISTAN     **** 	In case of a rape ,  a women was in reality a rape victim ,  and there was no eye witness , (  hadood law….4 adult male muslim)  and the man is accusing woman of ZINA (adultery) by simply bringing his friends …( 4 male muslim men) in reality she was raped . then ? ?   how could a girl under Haoood ordinance protect herself ???   ****** What if the girl who was raped …..has got witnesses but they are females or females and a non muslim …..even then according to Hadood laws….she can not testify them because …( u need 4 male muslim )   Can GOD be that cruel to the victims of rape ??????   remember there is no mentioning of medical test for defendants …but there is in QURAN as mentioned earlier in first phase   Certainly not because You only need witnesses ….male/female/anyone but adult ….and if there are Medical tests which can show whether it was rape or adultery ,then you don’t need witnesses anymore …..>>>>>> its not in Hadood ordinance …you must bring 4 adult male muslims …which maynotttttt  be  possible …..!!!!!!!!!!  Hadood Ordinance & QURAN:  heck of difference  H_ordinanceOrdinance  requires 4 adult male muslims and that’s it . NO medical tests for (defendants ,if they say that zina was merely an accusation & that 4 ppl were lieing , in reality it was rape , surely medical test can prove anything …but its not highlighted in Hadood ordinance …..   Quran :  Any proof (medical etc )  and 4 witnesses ( can be anyone but citizen of tht Islamic state..number is 4 as well)   In Ayat 24:11-13 :   “ a gang among you produced a big lie. Do not think that it was bad for you . Infact it was good for you ( as a lesson)……………………you should have demanded 4 witnesses, if the witnesses were not produced, then they are according to GOD , LIARS”

      Love has always been a stranger to me. Watch, as love passes me by. I can see those doves flying above the neighbor’s house. Three of them. I want some too. My head hurts as usual. I cannot look at the sky. Flowers that I can touch. In the night. In the darkness. The dark is not sheer due to the full moon. It is shining. How did I land into the night out of the day?  Does anyone know the size of my heart?  I am watching I am listening. Somewhere there is this emptiness. Maybe it is inside my heart. I am watching myself in the window. The car is moving fast. The road. It is long. On both sides golden reeds. The light reflecting off the road. Yes, we are all alone in the universe.  I am moving in circles that are infinitesimally concentric until I fall in upon myself. I am so tired. I want something but I do not know what it is. I am hungry and thirsty but it is not water that I want. It is not food that I crave.   I am watching myself fall. The white clothes that I wear flutter as I spread my arms to feel. I wanted to feel. Why couldn’t I ever feel anything that was real? Where is the reality in falling out of the sky? Then you connect with the earth so suddenly and your last image of life is the blue sky. No more doves. Emptiness that is finally real. Maybe blood is flowing out of my mouth and even my head where it connected with the ground. Freefalling objects from an empty blue sky. The thump of something solid falling and hitting ground. That is ground zero for you. Yes sir! Ground zero. Somewhere in the distance, maybe it is the firecrackers going off. The distance is so immense. You are not as far as the poles. You are not as far as the moon. You are farther then the farthest stars. We stand as far as the opposite corners of the universe.   And we are both so alone.  Don’t be sad. I will kiss you.  Do you also feel the emptiness creep out of you sometimes? Some times, you also want to look at the sun. Some times, you also want to go blind. You also wanted things you could not get. Why do we always want thing we cannot get?   I am running after the car. Then I stop because I cannot run. I cannot breathe. Breathing is so difficult. That is why I have stopped running. Not because I have given up.  Circumstances sometimes stop us. Why are they like this for us?  I was wondering at the stars. Sitting under the sky thinking maybe I would know where you were. I never thought you were with me from the beginning. Maybe this is also written in my genes. Or maybe it is because we are both made of stardust.   Is it because of this that even through this distance we can feel each other? Is this really feeling? Or is it deception like everything else?  The mind plays so many tricks on us. I am watching clouds form into faces and battle scenes and birds and flowers. I am ready to die one moment and ready to be reborn another.  I die one moment. And another moment I am born again.  Why don’t I die for once? Is death that easy or that difficult? Does life love me or do I love life. Will I ever know?  In my mind, you had the answer to my questions. I thought you carried something for me in your pocket that would make this hunger go away.  I turn away laughing but I turn away only to hide tears of disappointment. Please take that hand out of your pocket. It made me anticipate so much.

      Really nice song by Saliva!!! Lyrics of the day...   All Because of You   Something's wrong with me, Cause I can't even feel you now Or know that this is real. Am I blind to see that there's something there behind your eyes And it's bringing me to my knees. All I want is you and I don't care All I want is you and I don't care Cause all I do is wait in,  wondering and hoping,  that we'll survive it. I know that all this is true. All because of you. Something's wrong with you, The walls you build around you now, Seem to fit you like a glove. Something's wrong with you, Cause stars cannot be found in clouds that cover up their love. Cause all I do is wait in,  wondering and hoping,  that we'll survive it. I know that all this is true. All because of you.

       urlLink Making Purple By Dan Chiasson    Making Purple  By Dan Chiasson  Nibble what nibbles you, play dead, play bored;          play sad, shell gaping, like the cockle used for bait;  like the melting purple eat the mud, be seen through          like the pebble purple, light and soft like the reef purple.  Imagine yourself suffusing a woman's gown or sheets          your bloodstream running through a king's inkwell.  Those rich dyes once were your ideas, your love          of broccoli rabe. Half-killed cockles attract purples,  the reef is littered with open mouths waiting to snap.          I am trying to make my pain attractive, my yearning  pretty. A man caught me in a fine-ply lobster pot.          He scalded me until I nearly died, then threw me back.  I gape like this because of the ordeal. Did you foresee          this moment, where what you intended to devour  devours you? Did you know they'd haul us up          into the suffocating air, our bodies fused together?  He wrecked my body so that it looked like need.          You made your insatiable greed appear like love.   What a beautiful poem! And that last verse! Oh wow! Just the way I feel... you made your insatiable greed appear like love... and I put a question of my own to you... Why?

       It's 4 A.M. Nasruddin leaves the tavern and walks the town aimlessly. A policeman stops him. "Why are you out wandering the streets in the middle of the night?" "Sir," replies Nasruddin, "if I knew the answer to that question, I would have been home hours ago!"   That's from the book, The Essential Rumi, translated by Coleman Barks. It's a most wonderful book. Though Rumi is my heritage and I should've learnt to read him in Farsi, yet I have to rely on translations. Must say it's a wonderful translation though.   Why did I take this excerpt? Because this is how I feel nowadays.   Tonight I'll let you know about my feelings. I am feeling so odd. I'm not nervous but it's the feeling of impending doom. What with the fast and all, my stomach seems to be churning as well. Won't be giving him any reasons because there arent any. There's no reason why you feel in a certain way. All this time, while I thought that it was okay not to tell, I was wrong. Now that I think about it. I feel that I've been trying to hold onto him even though I knew that he might never be mine because there was this burden of truth on me. I want to be free. By telling the truth. By not denying it. I always used to ask myself, why do people deny the truth. They don't lie but they deny it. Now I know, the truth is much more scarier than anything in this world. We're always so scared of losing something that we'd rather make an alternate realit where we don't accept what's really real and true. Tonight I'll come to terms with the truth. I hope Allah will give me the strength to do this. InshAllah!

      This is one of those poem, after reading which, you start thinking about things. Certain things that you might otherwise not have wanted to think about. I guess Nasir Kazmi is the kind of poet who has always brought feelings and vague things into focus for me. The first time I read him was when I was 14. What's more interesting is that he gives that socialist touch in his poetry. The people's poet. Since, I don't know anything about the poet's life (there's not much literature available on that here in Peshawar... sigh!) and as I said in the last post, there isn't anyone I really know who'd know about these things. Living in Peshawar is not easy. It seems bereft of literary talent. *double sighs* There is Sir Taha Khan but how would I go meet him? That's another problem. Being a girl out here is a big problem. Nopes. Not a problem. It's a handicap. I'm far from the topic I started. So I was saying, to me Nasir Kazmi seems like a socialist or a communist (during his time, there were many socialist/communist poets and no I'm not confusing the two ideologies) because he used to write about the common man and his problems like life, economy, jobs etc. Anyway, I'll leave these thoughts incomplete for now. I need more information. I might be going to the Central Library in a few days. I'll see if I can find some information on him. Hope so!     Your Name Distresses Me Sometimes    Your name distresses me sometimes And without a cause do I feel restless sometimes  Oh, heart! Who has this gift of anxiousness? Only some get this comfort in life sometimes  With your blessings, oh pain of immaculate beauty Has become the heart a resting place for friends sometimes  The vigor of madness in the tempest of sorrow Has drowned your face in tears sometimes  A day when your proximity would not bring my heart content Has gone by on me sometimes  Neither thought of you nor thoughts of mine The night of parting has passed like that sometimes  Oh friend! Though long has it been since I quit love I have felt your need sometimes  Nasir Kazmi   18th November 2003

      Here's a poem by Munir Niazi, I translated from Urdu on 18th November, 2003, the day after his birthday, when he came to the department. I don't know for sure, but I think that he had some part in spurring this creative surge.   Anyway, what I really don't know about this poem is whether the translation does at least 50% justice to the actual poem. There's no one here at least in Peshawar who could help me find that out. I mean, no one who is an expert in both languages who could say, ok, this is a good translation or a bad translation. Khair, let's see. One of these days, I might get lucky too. (:   I Always Get Late (Belated)   I always get late in doing things To say something, to keep a promise To call him, to beckon him back I always get late. To help him, or to sympathize with my friend To meet someone on ways unrevealed I always get late. To put my heart in the changing seasons To remember someone, to forget someone I always get late. To save someone from some grief before death To tell someone that the truth was something else I always get late in doing everything.  Munir Niazi

      War Threats Peace   War and peace are terms that have been synonimized in today’s world due to the trend started by Adolph Hitler by starting the First World War. As the world moved from that episode, a second world war was started. After that there have been numerous wars that have been fought the world over, including civilian strife.   As many people as there are who are the proponents of peace, there would still be many who would tell you that war is important. There would be many reasons given by them for this laughable statement. Even in the non-civilized worlds, wars either used to be carried out for looting, plundering and pillaging or self-defense but nowadays a new trend has come to the fore, that of pre-emptive strikes: to strike the enemy in self-defense but without any provocation. That is what America is doing in Iraq.   Then there are wars that are fought for land that rightfully belongs to the races settled on that land. The finest examples would be Palestine and Kashmir.   The world has made at least some phony efforts at peace by making first the League of Nations and then United Nations. However, nowadays, even the United Nations fails to bring peace to war ravaged nations as it has become a puppet organization in the hands of its biggest member countries who are always either ready to veto peace moves or themselves be aggravators. Russia has been doing this in Chechnya for more than a decade now.   What a shame it is that today, peace has no value. It is fast becoming a term just for philosophers and academics. A term just found in books and not in the world we live in. Where there is war, there is only talk of peace and then even that disappears. There are white doves but no moves for peace.   Of all the wars that have been fought, there is seldom peace in the end. Wars might be fought for any reason, from regime change to no reasons at all. However, not only does a war have a human cost but also costs for the aggressor. Look at Afghanistan today. The USSR started the war in Afghanistan and it did not end but it was reduced from a cold war superpower to many of its component states. Then the civil war continued there for another decade until the Americans struck in the name of war on terror. Thus, the war in Afghanistan still goes on. Not only have many Afghans and many Americans lost lives but it is also costing billions to the Americans when they have started an offensive in Iraq also.   Evident from the Iraq chapter is another bitter truth for the world to see in light of all the examples given to us by history. That even this war might never end and even if it does, there would be no peace. In fact, there would be bitterness and resentment among the people against whom this atrocious crime of aggression has been carried out in the name of pre-emption, right in front of the very eyes of the world rather too blatantly.   If the world leaders and peace bodies keep quiet about these things, that day will not be far off when countries would be attacking each other on no premises at all. War would become the norm and they would be fought long and hard because weapons are as readily available to the aggressors as to the aggressed.   Palwascha W. Jan   Thursday October 02, 2003   I wrote this as an essay-speech for my friend Shehryar, who had promised someone to write her a speech. It later went on to win the first prize in the speech competion. I don't know this really well but if I'm not wrong, she was first among all the schools of the whole province. I was a bit flattered and also embarrassed *lol* I always get embarrassed and start blushing when something nice involving me happens and I think the same happens when there aren't many things nice. (: &nbsp; Shehryar told me that the girl was thanking the person who wrote it for her. For me that would've been enough but it's always nice to know that something you did went an extra mile or two to make someone happy (in this case, by winning the first prize... hooray!). I think I was happier than anyone to make a few people happy.  &nbsp; The text&nbsp;of the essay is unmodified here. Sherry made some minor changes in it. He added a few lines about Kashmir. Of course I always agree with Shakespeare that, "Brevity is the soul of wit" and would continue to do so.&nbsp; :P &nbsp; There's one thing that needs to be added to the essay though. People on all sides of a war suffer. The human toll is the biggest loss. I seriously doubt that a person who loses a family member would think about economy or gas prices or things like that (though in the long term one has to forget the human loss and concentrate on economy) and say it's all right because this might help me. We do tend to put invisible band aids on the marks left by the loss of someone close but they're always there for us to see. To remind us of our losses. Wars cripple people's hearts. They take away innocence. They make people vengeful and bitter. These are some of the reasons why I hate wars but most of all I hate them because I was watching Fahernheit 9/11 and my heart was going out to the Lila Lipscombe who lost her son to the war. My heart went out to the woman whose whole family was obliterated. My heart went out to the whole world in those moments. I remember when the planes were shown crashing into the Twin Towers. I remember how I had cried. Must the innocent be punished for the sins of a few? That question now repeats itself in my head again. It was 2001 then and 2004 now. Nothing seems to have changed.  &nbsp; Yes. I still hate war. Maybe, more.

      I wrote a few stories back in 2000 (12 to be exact). I used to write one at the end of every month except for December. They are incoherent yet linked because in many ways they're offshoots of my own every day experiences. I just made some modifications or added a few things here and there. I find that, essentially, even life is just a story. The difference between something written on a paper (or typed in a wordprocessor) is that the story called Life is happening all around me even as I type right now. On the other hand, these stories that we have in our minds might be extensions of the main plot but they're almost always in our heads. Even sometimes, recalls are stories fabricated by people to make them interesting for the listeners or readers. Somehow, sometimes even history seems like that... &nbsp; The one for December was written all over the year so it might be the one, which is most incoherent (though it's name might suggest otherwise). I don't think that I need coherence to put my point across. The point of writing is sometimes to unburden oneself and at times to burden the reader. The diary in which I had been writing down my thoughts (and notes) had been issued by some French company, thus the French names. That is not much of a reason. I guess it was more like I found some secret titles in those names. &nbsp; I thought I'd put them up on my blog. At least just for populating it *laughs* because I think I'm almost out of fresh things to say. Nowadays, there's just one thing on my mind and that's how I'm going to continue with my education sans money. Phew! It's making me sad. Guess on with the stories then.

       urlLink http://musibat-khan.deviantart.com  Jamal Khan's Online Art Gallery  A few days back Zia posted a message for me on the IMS messageboard about his friend's artistic endeavours. Yesterday, I checked it out and it's kind of interesting. It's Jamal Khan aka Musibat Khan from NCA. Though, the art doesn't have relevance to us as the people of Pakistan but seen from a global perspective, I find it in a way, enduring. The attention he gives to details is really admirable and I must say a lot lies in those details. I loved the anime and the cover for his illustrated book "Wahid". It's funny that his lone wolf hero shares his first name with my last.  All in all, it's a wonderful collection. Pop art at one time, anime at another and comic book art at another time. I would give him 7/10 (if I may be allowed that).
