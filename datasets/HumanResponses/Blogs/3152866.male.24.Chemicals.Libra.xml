      Time: 5.5 hours to go Location: fortress of solitude (back of Rolf’s store)  Dane and Joel finally removed their superhero costumes for a quick wash. The duo can’t wait until 7 p.m. when Spiderman 2 opens.   Dane wraps his lips around a straw and sucks up a huge amount of watermelon slurpee. A momentary brainfreeze cripples the crimefighter who can push big rocks with the greatest of ease. The second gulp does the same. Dane can’t take the pain anymore and slams the slush against the wall.  Joel comes back after attending to a customer, lights a cigarette and exhales a breath of pure smoke. A satisfying look crosses his face. With all the criminal inactivity in the Rocky area, Joel’s sobered up. He’s been too busy slaving for the man, Rolf, to devour gallons and gallons of rye serum. Dane wonders if this superhero team will disband in the near future.  “Only five and a half fucking hours to go,” states Joel, who has taken up swearing instead of drinking. “Shit! Spiderman 2 is going to fucking rock ass!”  “Yep,” Dane replies. “They should really make a new Superman movie.”   Joel begins a rant about some site with all the latest Superman movie gossip. Dane stares at the slurpee slowly dripping down the wall. How could a cup of delicious fluid defeat the mighty Dung Beetle Guy? It must be some ingenious weapon from some super villain, or maybe frozen drinks are DBG’s kryptonite.  “You know, fuck, Spiderman could kick the living shit out of fucking Superman, don’t you assface?” Joel inquires of Dane.   Dane gives Joel the glance of death. It doesn’t work. Dane wonders if his super powers are fading.   “How the hell could you say that!?” Dane yells back. “There is no possible way. Spiderman wouldn’t stand a chance.”  “Fuck you! All he’d need is some kryptonite crap,” Joel says. “Asshole Superman would be a useless piece of shit.”  “Damn it, you’re right,” concedes Dane. “But without kryptonite, Superman would smash Spiderman. Hell, even Superdog could squish Spiderman.”  “Well, that’s a given,” is Joel’s only reply.   The front door chimes. Joel rushes to the till ready to serve his next customer. He’s taking care of his duty to society. He sells legal drugs to addicts. Whether it’s sugar to kids, nicotine to smokers or porn to sexaholics, Joel is right there ready to feed the needs of the citizens of Rocky. Without Joel, they'd have to buy their stuff from someone else.

      Sung to the tune of Victory Day by Tom Cochrane:  He's got no reason, but he's got pride People thought Martin was through Sponsorship trouble? No, he cried We'll turn to see what is true Martin's Canada came into play On this Election Day  He's stuck it out, He's hung in tough Today just wasn't his day Attack ads came, but each time they did He managed to keep them at bay But plurality, it's escaped him today Harper grumbles, then goes on to say Pollsters need a big cut in their pay On this Election Day  Election Day, Election Day There's no rockets flaring, there's no loud display This country's Red shone through anyway On this Election Day  Oh Layton, think of the children, said Layton But a two percent margin, that's kind of small It's all he could hope for, winning his seat That smiling ass didn't help his party at all And the Bloc-heads came through as usual Seperation coming? Well, they just can't say Four percent vote, just for the Greens They'll receive funding and I guess that's okay On this Election Day  Election Day, Election Day There's no rockets flaring, there's no loud display Third and fourth parties got down and prayed On this Election Day  So this is the news as it happens A Liberal minority will now take the stage But don't get too comfy, because it seems That with no alliance you won't get to stay Just a matter of time Till the House says "We hate you and we want you to pay"  Election Day, Election Day There's no rockets flaring, there's no loud display See you in six months, or at least by next May The next Election Day, the next Election Day

      After casting your ballot and before heading out to get totally sloshed while awaiting the results, you might want to check out some [booming voice] urlLink Federal Election Trivia !  On another note, I was shocked to see a picture of George W. Bush mixed among pictures of the Canadian party leaders on the front page of the National Post. However, closer inspection revealed that it was actually Paul Martin squinting rather fiercely. This must mean something.  Sick to death of local radio stations and having an acute case of election fever, I've decided to connect to the live feed of CBC over the net. If we had decent reception in the area, I wouldn't have to do tie up the store's phone line doing this. And there's another small problem: election coverage doesn't start until six, and I'm not not planning on disconnecting until well after we close at eleven. But since I don't feel like fielding questions from fat assholes asking if there's tax on our candy, this is no big loss for me.  Dane has posted in the interim but because there was no editor around to correct his mistakes it posted on June 23. Go figure.

      Dane should've written something by now, but when he viewed our hit count yesterday he freaked out and is currently huddled under a coffee table and whimpering. I somehow knew it was a bad idea to get Extreme Tracking, but I never foresaw something like this. I guess I better throw something up here while the poor bastard recovers. I've got to quell the demands of our loyal readers (HAH!) before they start rioting in the streets...  But thanks to a bout of creative constipation - an all-too-apt metaphor considering the quality of my work - I'm currently undetermined about which comedic clich&eacute; I should abuse next. So in the meantime I'm going to toss up an old Outland cartoon. Trust me, it's a classic.    urlLink        If you're an ignorant jackass or an avid fan of Nickelback (although those two things aren't mutually exclusive) you need to click on the picture to view the strip at full size.  Also, if you don't know about Outland and its far better predecessor Bloom County, and are interesting in learning more, may I suggest clicking  urlLink here ? And if you're not, may I suggest that you get the hell off of this site? Thank you, folks; and have yourself a wonderful night!

      Okay, it's been almost a week, and neither Dane and I have made an effort to thank a very special person who's done our fledgling website right. Who am I talking about? Why, it's none other than  urlLink Steve Smith , who I'm sure needs no introduction. At least, if you're reaching this humble page through the means I'm sure you are. Thanks to his link to our site, our hit count has shot through the roof! So, as an effort to thank him, both of us have tried to unearth a photo so that we may glorify him to the masses. From what we've read this should've been a lot easier task than it turned out to be. However, after a strenuous effort involving equal parts luck, grit, and moxie we've managed to do it; and even better, it's one of him participating in council. So without further ado, we here at Super Fun Happy Amazing Hour present Mr. Steve Smith:         That's it, Steve! You go legislate evil a new asshole!

      Dane went to see Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story without me. The following cartoon encapsulates my feelings about this perfectly.              Beware Dane, beware.     Also, I'm very annoyed that this page has a much higher hit count than  urlLink my personal blog ; mostly because I put a lot more effort into making the posts there than I do here. So I should let you know that if you're looking for marginally more intelligent discourse than stories about drunken superheroes, you should go  urlLink check it out .

      In the past month, I've had the pleasure to attend four graduations. I only participated in my convocation from MRC. I've had to endure inspirational speech after inspirational speech. You can do whatever you put your mind to. The sky's the limit. You're about to embrace life. It's all the same.  I thought my graduation was special. I thought I was part of the only class that could become rich, famous and successful. I can't believe it's not true.   What did I want to do when I left high school? Damned if I knew, so I went to the University of Calgary for a semester. I studied psychology and economics. After I turned 18, I found the lib. I had to wait until the end of October to legally drink. I pretty much flunked out of UofC.   I took some time off before returning to MRC. I enrolled in some general study classes, keeping some of my schedule free for the liberty lounge. I ended up in the Journalism program. Fun times. Lots of drinking and laughs.  Four years later, I'm done. I just have two months of working at the Mountaineer before I'm mailed my degree. Yippy.  I don't remember any grad speech preparing me for that.  What's the point of graduating? I guess it's for the parents and the sentimental students.   Maybe I'm just sick of graduations. If you made it this far, thanks for reading my speal.

      It’s been three weeks since their last encounter with evil and they were starting to get bored. Dane, with his chips, and Joel, with the remote, were about to embark on another day of nothingness.  Dane thrusts his hand high into the air and brings it down with a loud crunch into the chip bowl. He grabs a handful and shoves them into his mouth. Smoky bacon chips are his favorite. Crumbs fall onto his chest. He doesn’t care.   “Why the hell don’t we ever get an email of distress from mayor Lou Soppit?” Joel demands.   Dane shrugs his shoulders. “Maybe email isn’t the best method,” Dane comments. “Batman and Commissioner Gordon used a phone. Maybe we should use a phone.”  “Shut up! You fool.” Joel yells and readies his hand for a bitch slap, but doesn’t execute. Dane is momentarily startled. “I’m the brains. You stupid ass. You do what I say.” Joel clenches his fist and raises it into the air. His elbow is at a ninety degree angle. A bright light shines in through the window, silhouetting Joel. A truly perfect superhero moment. Too bad Dane was the only one to see it, and he just doesn’t care.  Dane crams more delicious Lay potato chips into his mouth. Joel’s face returns to a normal skin tone after his burst of rage. Joel changes the channel. It’s muchmusic.   “Why the hell did they take Bob and Dave off TV?” Joel’s face regains its fiery red colour. The discontinuation of Bob and Dave is a sensitive subject for Joel.   “Calm down Joel. It’s just a show,” Dane says, regretting it moments later.  “JUST A SHOW. Mr. Show was more than JUST-A-SHOW.” Joel’s rage can’t be controlled. He stands up, spins three times and erupts. “Whoooop, whooop, whoop, whoop, whoop.” He does a perfect imitation of Dr. Zoidberg.   Dane bolts to his feet. He doesn’t have a clue what Joel is capable of. The last time Joel got this upset, Orlin found himself on the floor after a failed homework snatching. Dane’s hands raise to shoulder height and he begins pushing the air in front of him. It’s a defensive posture. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. The pair circle one another. It looks like a fight to the death is about to commence. The milkshake song plays in the background.   Bing! The computer chimes. “You have mail,” a robotic voice informs the crime fighting heroes. They rush to the laptop with delight. Their death match put on hold.  Joel clicks a couple buttons. Dane looks over Joel’s shoulder in anticipation. He wonders what kind of crime it could be. Godzilla? An alien invasion? Hell, he’d settle for a common nazi ninja fight.  “Spam. Fucking spam,” Joel looks to roof and screams. “AARRRRRGGGH.” Dane grabs his chips, sits back down and stuffs his face.

      Anthony is a busy guy on Mondays. You can tell by the way he wanders around the office with a disgruntled look on his face. Anthony is another reporter at the Rocky Mountain House Mountaineer, and Monday is production day, so it's busy.   I often wonder if all his wandering is really him planning out the quickest possible way to kill everyone. He counts his steps, and looks for problem areas. Where would the resistance come from? Where is the best and most likely place to reload? Is a nice circle route the best or would a quick in and out straight line be appropriate? Could he make it out the back door before the cops get to the paper? I'm sure he's clocked out how long it takes to drive from the police station the Mountaineer.   Then it happens. Snap! Anthony pulls his gun out of his camera bag. We all thought it was a Nikon D-100. It turned out to be an AK-47. Bullets spray the office. Two secretaries are left for dead. Little bloody holes appear on their bodies. The remaining employees panic. They yell and scream. The loudest cry comes from the desk in the corner, by the window. Dane didn't believe today could be the last of his life.  The only problem Anthony didn't foresee was Joel Nielsen: Disorientedman. He stumbles into the office with the first cries for help. Anthony, with his gun, tries and shoot the superhero. Unfortunately, the DoM's movements are unpredictable. One minute he's lurching to the right and the next moment he's face first on the ground. There's no way to anticipate the DoM's actions.  "Ssstoppp," slurs the DoM, spittle flies from his mouth as he unknowingly exaggerates his P in stop.  Anthony lets out a laugh. He has no idea the ass kicking he's going to get.  "dOOn't U laffff at meeee," the DoM utters as he crashes into the photocopier. A gush of blood erupts from his forehead. "Eowwww." Blood stings the DoM's eyes. His vision blurs, which doesn't help the double vision he already has.  "You stupid drunk bastard. Get out of here before you kill yourself," Anthony states. He points his gun at the DoM and makes a threatening face. It's really scary.  "I'mm not druunkk. I'm just disoriented, man," responds Joel Nielsen with DoM written on his chest. The reek of rye is on his breath and urine stains his pants. It's been a rough day of disorienting people at the local strip club. The DoM is starting to realize his tolerance to his rye transformation solution is increasing. He'll have to increase his dosage to doubles. It won't belong before he's downing triples.  Bang! Anthony fires his gun. Disorientedman can't stand up straight and falls over to his left, narrowly eluding the bullet.   "Hold still you piece of shit," yells Anthony, frustrated with the DoM's inability to stay still.  In the corner of the office, hidden under his desk another superhero is about to make an appearance.  Bang! A second shot. A second miss. Anthony lets loose a ferocious scream of frustration. The DoM falls to the ground and covers his ears.   "Whaaatt de helll waas thhat?" asks Joel's alter ego, as we grabs his flask of serum and downs a little. He gets to his feet after two failed attempts.  In the corner, a mask is pulled over a face.  Anthony lets loose a couple rounds. A bunch more employees are bloodied up. The DoM reacts. He falls forward straight onto Anthony's shoes. Just enough to hold Anothony in one spot. A death cry errupts from the corner of the room.   "Oh my god, it's the guy with the abilities of a dung beetle," Stu proclaims. It was earlier in the week Stu won a celebrity look alike contest for his Brent Butt impersonation.  "Yes it is I. Dungbeetleguy." DBG runs over to Anthony and pushes him against the wall. He rolls Anthony into a ball. The sounds of bones snapping can be heard by the radio station upstairs. DBG finally quits rolling Anthony into a bloodied pulp. He wakes the DoM up. The DoM passed out as soon as his head his the carpet.  Evil was vanquished and a new superhero duo formed. A pair that could rival Clark Kent and Superman, weed and Rob, Dave and Bob, peanut butter and jam on bread. Villains beware! Rocky Mountain House has a pair of crime fighters who aren't smart enough to get out of your way. With the DoM as the peanut butter and DBG as the jam, they're going to make one tasty sandwich.

      Joel advised me about Prey for Rock and Roll. He said Gina Gershon supposedly sucked. She did. The movie did and I'm pissed off I sat through the entire thing.   If a movie has a hot girl with a tight leather outfit on the cover, it should have some nudity. The movie needed something. At least Showgirls knew enough to put naked girls in the film. The back cover of Prey for Rock and Roll even mentions a sexy thrill ride. There was no sex, no thrill and I've had better rides on donkeys.  I did however watch dumb and dumberer. It was funny. Not as good as the first but decent. I would recommend it to friends, but only watch it once. After that, it becomes stupid. The jokes aren't funny after the one time. The actors are very similar to Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels, but they're not the same. Watch it though. It's stupid, but puts a smile on your face.  Now I'm back to thinking up schemes to keep the ladies away from Joel.

What's my favorite kind of bee?  Boo bee.  With luck on our side, Dane will be posting again soon. Then I'll never have to subject you to this again.

      This  urlLink story  was considered important enough to make the front page of yesterday's Edmonton Sun, but for the benefit of our readers who are either shut-ins or from Texas, I've decided to mention it here. It's yet another reason to give out a guttural snort of derision whenever somebody talks wistfully about married life.

      Once again Joel is using his superior intelligence to get back at me, check my bio. Damn your huge cranium. I shake my fist in your general direction. Why can’t you leave my obsession with Clay Aiken alone. He should have won. You know it; I know it. What’s wrong with the American people who voted? Don’t they know talent when they see it? Man, I’m starting to tear up. Time for a short break to regain my composure.  I’m back. What do I have to say? It’s a good thing George Michaels, Joel's hero, didn’t attempt to become an American Idol. He could never do it. Only the best of the best make it, like Van Dam in that movie with the fighting. What was it called?. So yeah. Take that. In your face Joel. Boo-yaaa. Rocky West Side. Out.

      Well, my blog partner has decided to start making posts. And just about all of them has something derogatory about me. It's almost to the point where Dane seems to have some psycho-sexual obsession with yours truly. However, I've decided to take the high road and not dignify this donkey braying with a response.  In other news, Dane has posted his  urlLink bio .

      I run out my front door, down the stairs and along the gravel road. Abruptly the road becomes a trail and the trail leads to a rocky, dusty clearing. The sky is blood red with black clouds. Lightning flashes in the background. Thunder rumbles. What world am I in?  Sweat drips down my forehead. My lungs burn. I’m exhausted. I can’t stop to catch my breath. I don’t know what I’m fleeing from. All I know is that it’s evil. I look back. There’s nothing. Why am I running? Fear.  Finally my legs give way. I fall to the ground. I crawl forward a couple metres. My hands clasp red dirt as I pull myself forward.   Out of the corner of my eye, a blurry specter appears. My mind panics. Who is it? What does it want with me? The ghost takes shape. It wears a black hooded robe, carries a scythe, has skeleton hands and two beady red eyes. Death has come to claim my life.  I roll on my back and stare. I try to scream but my throat is dry.   “Do you know who I am?” Death’s voice booms.   I nod my head. I’ve met him before. My skin crawls.   “I’m here to guide you to the land of the dead.” The wraith lifts its blade high in the air. It has to kill my body before my soul can leave the world of the living behind.  I don’t want to leave my life, my family, my friends. I grab a handful of rocks. I throw them.  Death chuckles at my pitiful attempt. My last glimpse is the scythe’s shiny, silver tip penetrating my chest. Blood splatters everywhere. I shut my eyes.  When my eyelids open, I’m standing next to Death, naked. I don’t feel any pain. My chest bears no scars. I’m no longer afraid. I’m curious. What’s happening now?  “Follow me,” orders Death. It’s not a scary voice anymore. It’s almost soothing. A James Earl Jones type voice. The earth feels like a sandy beach on my bare feet.   “Where to?” I ask.   “You’ll find out shortly,” is its reply. I follow.   We head towards a black portal. Just before I step into the darkness, I awake in my bed. Blankets drenched in sweat. I feel good though. I take five deep breaths, roll over and fall back asleep.   Dying equals death.  I’ve heard it’s supposed to be a bad omen to die in your dreams, well your nightmares. I’ve been told that you die in real life shortly after. It’s not true. I’ve been killed numerous times in my dreams and one time I even went out looking to kill Death. I didn’t succeed, but damn was I close. Death beheaded me on an altar that time.  I’ve been hit by cars. I’ve been shot. I’ve plummeted to my death. I don’t just wake up at time of impact. I actually leave my body, rise up and look down upon myself. The first time was creepy. The second time wasn’t any better, but now I’m used to it.   I don’t know what happens in the afterlife, but I’m getting very curious. It's a new mystery to explore. It's something totally new and exciting. No one can warn you. No one can prepare you for what to expect. Religions try, but there are so many of them. Who is right? Are we reincarnated? Do we become that new baby born in the maternity ward and begin on another life? Heaven? Hell? Do we sail across the sea for eternal life like the elves in Lord of the Rings? Maybe our bodies are unplugged from the Matrix? We’re tossed into the used battery drawer.   Whatever it is I hope it’s fun. I hope it’s like Mardi Gras, spring break, the 4th of July all wrapped up as a Christmas present.   I'm sure Joel will tell me it's dark, gloomy and not fun. Screw you Joel.

      Being a journalist, I get to cover some fun and exciting stuff. One example is town council. Seven councilors battle it out on a bi-weekly basis to keep the town thriving. They discuss the important issues and tackle the most minuscule details. I wouldn’t take their job for anything in the world, not even to put Mr. Show back on television. Sorry Joel.   At the latest meeting, one hot debate sticks out in my mind. It was the wording of a bylaw. The bylaw dealt with skating on frozen ponds and rivers and the posting of thin ice signs. The controversy was between “not uniformly consistent” versus “uniformly inconsistent.” The conversation went back and forth between two councilors. The public gathering, three people, found the whole ordeal amusing. The council took the matter very seriously. Now whenever the ice is not uniformly consistent, thin ice signs must be posted 75 metres apart. God bless the councilors and all their hard work.  Another subject on the agenda was the smoking bylaw. Should the town regulate where, when and who can smoke? Should the town stay out of the situation? The local bottle depot lady came with a report. Surprisingly enough places that make business off smokers didn’t want the town to do anything. Places that didn’t care, just didn’t care. And the minority of people who don’t want to die from a slow, painful cancerous death were opposed. I’m a non-smoker and don’t really care. My lungs enjoy clean, fresh air, but they don’t cry every time some second hand smoke comes their way. I’m still sitting on the fence on this subject. Should I leave because I don’t smoke and want some fresh air or should smokers leave because they have a nicotine addiction? In a perfect world, we’d invent a cigarette that didn’t give off second hand smoke. Everyone would be happy then. Or why don’t cigarette companies cure cancer. They have the money, and then more people would smoke, if they didn’t have to worry about dying from cancer.   Should the town of Rocky pay for the maintenance of our beloved windmill, or tear it down and replace it with a plaque on a rock? The windmill remembers all the Dutch/Canadian war heroes during world war 1, but that doesn’t really matter. Who cares about WWI? I do. I can’t believe the town would even think about demolishing something so important. We should just start kicking over tombstones and pissing on the graves. So it costs a little money. It’s a small price to pay. I’m glad I’m not in the bottom of some bloody, muddy trench awaiting my death. They’ll throw money at a $10,000 dollar clock, but remembering our war heroes is too much to ask.  The next greatest event in a small town journalist’s week is police briefs. The amount of small stupid crimes is outstanding. People report everything. “RCMP were informed about a student who left for school and failed to show up. The youth was located in Rocky a short time later.” Who cares? Amazingly it’s crime that sparks the readers interest the most.   “A complaint was made under the Mental Health Act about an unstable person who had left the Rocky hospital.” I believe this person was none other than Joel. His not wearing any pants antic finally made its way into the news. There’s even a pantless picture of Joel on this blog. After seven long years, Joel finally achieved his goal of being known as the pantless guy. Check that off the to-do list. He tried the backwards, inside-out shirt routine for a while, butt that didn’t last too long. Actually it was for only one day. A thumbs up for trying though. Not too many people would dare attempt the feat, but Joel wasn’t afraid of what his classmates thought.

      I'm not much of a political animal, so I can't rightly claim that I found this piece of  urlLink utter brilliance  by myself. Kudos goes to some  urlLink Steve Smith guy , who makes the only blog I read on a regular basis. Apparently he's a hack, which I'm guessing means he's in desperate need of some Buckley's, or he's a washed-up cab driver. Or maybe some other concept I'm entirely ignorant of. Anyway, check it out; you won't regret it. Or don't, it's entirely up to you...

      I was driving to work today, and like every convenience store clerk does in their free moments, I was pondering the mysteries of the universe. After kneading the old what is reality question in my brain for a while, I decide to turn to what is wrong with our world. Then, in a flash of brilliance, it hit me.  Flash back to 1987. What was a female sex symbol like back then? Well, for example:         Ah, good old Heather Locklear. Still attractive by today's standards. Now let's take a look at a male sex symbol:         George Michael. Ummm, yeah. Anyway, let's flash forward four years, to 1991. Female sex symbol, step right up:         Hmmm, Sharon Stone! The woman who made icepicks sexy! I know you don't want to, but let's look at a male sex symbol:         Vanilla Ice. Dammit. Puts everything into perspective, doesn't it?

      I have decided to increase my standards when it comes to leaving servers gratuities. I hate the way society deems it mandatory to leave a tip for every bit of service. I go to lunch; I have to leave a tip. I order a drink from the bar; I have to leave a tip. Enough is enough.  	 I could just be a pissed off cook bitching about the amount of money waitresses make. I could be whining and complaining because they’d treat the kitchen like shit. I might be pissed off because they didn’t see past all the drunks hitting on them that they weren’t the only ones with crappy jobs. I’d have traded jobs quicker than I can cut mushrooms, which is really fast I just don’t think the average server should get free money. I’m speaking about the bar industry waitresses. Not the ones in restaurants. They’re okay. 	 It really yanks my crank when a bartender needs a tip. Grab a beer, twist off the top and serve. Why should I tip for that? I do the exact same thing all the time. I don’t go to the fridge, stare at it and wish I had someone to open the door remove the cap and hand the beer to me. I don’t mind leaving a little change if the beer is brought directly to my table, but how much is it worth? And what is their hourly wage for? Wiping down a table?  	 Don’t get me wrong, some waitresses are very nice and worth a little extra, but for all those who have been in the industry too long and have become bitter get a new job. And for all those who make mistakes because you’re too stupid, it’s not cute. And yes we are laughing at you for being so stupid. The minute you walk away we’re bitching about the crappy job you’re doing, but of course we’ll succumb and you leave that tip. It might not be as much, but it’ll still be there. 	 How hard is it to be a server? I don’t know, but from what the servers tell me it’s the worst experience in the world. The atmosphere is loud, it’s hard to hear orders and the smoke makes their eyes water. Ninety-nine per cent of them are smokers, so I don’t see what they’re bitching about. I have to say. Serving is probably the highest paid uneducated job. I think it should be mandatory for servers to go to serving school. If the job is as hard as they make it out to be, there should be some kind of education. Maybe a two year apprenticeship course at SAIT. I don’t think there’s enough to know for a four year degree, but a little actual training would be nice. A course at figuring out when to refill drinks, how to take orders, how many free shots can you accept and still serve at a decent level and how to properly flirt to maximize tips. All important skills.  	 I really believe every table should have a little electronic menu. The customer just presses a button and the food or drink has been ordered. The grub would come in a timely manner by a food runner. We could eliminate the position of server all together. It would save people money. Enough money, you could get another one or two drinks a night. That’s all anyone really wants is another couple drinks.  	 I advise everyone to be weary when they leave a tip. Actually think about what they did and what you’re paying them for. Here’s what I do. Fifty cents for every trip to the table. It’s twenty steps and usually they don’t have to do anything. An extra dollar for kindness. Be aware of the servers section. Is it busy? If it is, let a couple things slide. It’s not their fault management didn’t schedule enough workers. If it’s slow, they better be on top of shit. If they leave me with an empty drink, I leave them no tip. NO TIP. Don’t throw you’re money away on crappy service. Instead give me an email and I’ll let you know where to send it.  Remember, don’t drink and read comics. You’ll fuck up the spines and they’ll be worthless.

      Since Superman is my childhood hero, I fully believe he could complete a centurion (100 shots of beer in 100 minutes) no problem. He could shotgun a can of beer for each drink and still fly back to the fortress of solitude in a straight line. I’m guessing beer is Superman’s drink of choice. There's nothing better than a nice cold, frosty mug of ale, not lager, on a nice, hot sunny day in the city of Metropolis. I’m guessing Jerry Siegel would have him drinking a Budweiser, but Joe Shuster would put a case of Canadian beer in the superhero’s fridge.Yeah Canada. In a bar, Superman would be the guy playing golden tee, pool or darts. He is very competitive and needs to be the best at everything.  Batman could also pound back quite a few. He has mental problems and needs something to suppress the death of his parents, Robin 1 and 2 and all the people he couldn’t save. Hell, I’m surprised he’s not throwing up all over the batcave and wrapping the batmobile around lampposts throughout Gothem. I know I would. Batman seems like a rye guy. A glass of JD on the rocks. He likes the way Jack burns his throat on the way down. Batman would sit in his chair and drink. He’d think about all the ways to kick the shit out of the others sitting near him. 	 The Flash would always be the first one drunk. The drinks would warm his belly at a speed only matched by Superman. Flash does have a super metabolism which could hinder his attempts to get drunk, so I’m guessing he’d be a shot guy. One after the other, until they started to take effect. He’s a sissy so I’m guessing he’d order fuzzy navels and electric popsicles. Once drunk Flash wouldn’t shutup. He’d keep jibbering and jabbering until Batman knocked him out. 	 Why am I spouting off about the drinking habits of the greatest men on the planet? Well, this past weekend, I happened to witness one drunk superhero. He let his secret identity slip out for the world to see. After enough rye and beer to sufficiently buzz the average man, Joel became Disorientatedman. He can stumble to the ground quicker than the common drunk and has a hard time taking a piss at a urinal. Underneath his shirt, he has a wobbly DoM etched on his chest with black marker. He’s better known as the DoM to the regulars of the drunk tank.  	 I’ve heard the legend of a guy wandering around the streets of Rocky Mountain House in a disorganized fashion, but I didn’t believe them. Now, I know better. I never had the chance to see the famous acronym, but I saw the well-known stagger, the slurring and the reckless spending. I happened to see the DoM’s finishing move: the pass out. His eyes roll deep into the back of his skull, he emits a heavy laboured snoring noise to repel off intruders and he didn’t even use blankets. Blankets slow down his reaction time. What if someone needs a disorientating right away? I had suspicions that Joel was the DoM ever since my 18th birthday party; now I know for sure. I’m spreading his secret identity to everyone who reads this blog. Beware of the DoM. He’ll make you feel uninebriated and capable of driving. He’s so disorientated that you feel fine. 	 Where ever the DoM can be found, the Ball of Fury isn’t far away. He’s a 5 foot five inch being of pure blubber mixed in with a dash of rage. Mike Spoor is the man behind the anger. He’s fiercer than a snapping turtle and has the ferocious beak to match. He likes to yell and scream and isn’t afraid of crying. I’d like to give you a warning, but he’s hard to describe. He’s either Spanish, Mexican, Canadian or American. He has that lovable, kill-dem-all American attitude. The only person who can put a lid on the Ball of Fury’s incredible can of whupass is Hoser. They have a strange relationship. It could be a gay love affair or just two drinking buddies who never get out of the I love you stage. 	 After all the superhero sightings over the past weekend. I can’t wait to party like it’s June 12, 2004 again. With the help of my spindly little arms, I’m going to raise the roof. Whoop, Whoop.

      A relationship in the Joel-verse is not quite like a relationship in the real world. To illustrate my point, I've slapped together some panels from a couple of comics I've been reading. All thanks go to Grant Morrison, Phillip Bond, Cameron Stewart, and a group of inkers, colourers, and letterers I've forgot; even though this is without their express written consent. Oh yeah, this should go without saying but some people are idiots; this post will be very graphic intensive. Don't be a whiny bitch. Just wait, and watch brilliance unfold in front of your eyes.    So Without Further Ado...     The Beginning - Stasis Period : Relationship Inertia    The Courtship - First Contact ? Emotional Calculus    The Honeymoon Period - Unreality ! Synaptical Jazz    The End - Heart of Mind * Fatally Yours    The Aftermath - Female Agression + Affection Inverse     So there you go. It's only a matter of time before  urlLink Vertigo  comes and gang rapes me, so enjoy it while it lasts.

      I think Joel had a little too much catnip last night after work. I'm going to have to beat him like Williams beat Tyson. It'll take four rounds of pummling, but in the end Joel will fall face first on to the canvas and cry like a little girl. I'll raise my mighty fists skyward and hug my trainer, Van Dam.  Joel's bloodied, battered, bruised body will be swept over the edge of the ring, never to be found again.  Anyway, Bozzy's pool hall is shutting down in Rocky. It'll reopen in two weeks under the name of the Fish Bowl. It's not like I went to Bozzy's too often, but I'm not going to the fish bowl ever. What a crappy name.

          Hello everybody! This is Joel speaking. This is an historic day for our site, because Dane and I have decided to co-author a post! I have to admit that the excitement in the air is palpable. Why don't you say hi to the nice people, Dane?    Hey.    Oh c'mon, Dane; you can do better than that.    Hey moron, I didn't even wanna do this, so don't start co-depending me!    I think you mean condescend.    Damn it Joel! That's it, get out of my house. And stop inviting yourself over!    But I thought it'd be something cool for the blog!    This is the stupidest idea you've ever had.    And I even made cool little icons for us!    Who cares? I'm not a damn cat.    Watch it, you peckerhead...    No! Guess what? You're off the team! I'm out too! No blog!    What? You can't do that! I'm the administrator, you stupid asshole!    Fuck you! You piece of shit! Get the hell outta here! Where's that crowbar...    Damn it, why does this keep happening to me?

      I thought I'd mention this story for the last paragraph. It shows why criminals are criminals.   40 held hostage in Halifax robbery    Last Updated Fri, 30 Jul 2004 13:46:20 EDT    HALIFAX - About 40 employees of a big box store in Halifax were held hostage for more than three hours early Friday while a gang robbed the store.    Police said four or five armed and masked men entered the Costco store at about 3 a.m., taking the overnight staff hostage. They proceeded to tie up the early morning staff as they arrived for work between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m.    No one was hurt.    The robbers ransacked the store, taking a number of items including a large amount of cigarettes.    Police say they are looking for a cube van with a picture of a purple octopus on the side.    Written by CBC News Online staff   A picture of a purple octopus on the side. How inconspicuous. There must be millions of purple octopus sided vans driving around Halifax. Some people are just too stupid. They should be shot. There's no use for people like that in society. They might be able to handle a job at a convenience store. There's no way they could hold an occupation as strenuous as being a reporter.

      I have always respected the law. I fear the repercussions of breaking the law. I'm not sure&nbsp;I do&nbsp;anymore.   On Wednesday, I covered provincial court in Rocky Mountain House. Was I ever disappointed with our justice system. I've been a law abiding civilian my entire life. I don't have a criminal record. I do have two speeding tickets, which I paid in a timely manner.    What's the point?    The entire process was crap. Half of the names on the docket never showed. The afternoon trial was held over because the witness never appeared, and the lawyers were unorganized and unprofessional.   Three quarters of the charged had their court dates postponed. The quarter that did face the consequences of their actions received the minimum charge.   I was thoroughly disgusted with one case in particular. Ivan C. Beaverbones entered the local dollar store and attempted to steal some batteries. He was drunk and the staff caught him in the act. He had also cut himself and was bleeding all over the building. He received a $100 fine for the theft and another $100 fine for breech of probation, which he received for being drunk. He not supposed to drink and must attend AA meetings every week.   I would have been all right with the sentence had he been a first time offender. Beaverbones has a long list of criminal activity. He's a drunk criminal and even the prosecutor said he expects to see Ivan again real soon. "He's a nuisance and he'll be back." I'm starting to understand the 3-strike rule in California. We need to put some fear into the criminals again. The death sentence doesn't stop people from killing, but I'm sure it has decreased the numbers.  Anyway, Ivan left the courtroom smiling. He has no respect, so why should the average citizen who actually obeys society's rules?   I'm also trying to figure out the relationship between the population of natives in the area and the number that appear in court. There are five times the number on non-native people living in Rocky, but there are about the same amount of natives in court as non-natives. There were five members of the Beaverbones clan, two members of the Goodrunning family, two Redbears among others. I hope this is a Rocky anomaly. If this is the case everywhere, something has to be changed.   I will give them some credit. They all showed up. They know how the system works even if they don't care for it.   I always thought justice was an all powerful being. A godlike figure,&nbsp;who slams&nbsp;his gavel down. Now I believe he is more of a withered, battered old man, who has seen too much and just doesn't care.

      I got a nice chuckle out of this story when I first read it. I found the article at cnn.com. What are her great-grandkids going to think?  I have to say this is one criminal Dane and Joel might have a chance at beating up.   ROME, Italy (Reuters)     &nbsp;  Italian police have arrested an 80-year-old great-grandmother suspected of drugging and robbing easily fooled victims for years to feed her gambling habit.    Vittoria Benetti was detained after her last victim, a 70-year-old woman travelling in the same train compartment, identified her in a photo, Italian media reported Saturday.    Benetti drugged her with a cup of coffee and then escaped with 1,000 euros ($1,226) which she promptly spent at a casino in neighboring Slovenia.    Benetti's criminal record for a string of frauds and swindles and her obsession for gambling made it easy for the police to track her down, newspapers said.    &nbsp; I guess prison is just about as bad as an old-folks home. The difference is the abondoned, retired old people have pensions and life savings. Prisoners have cigarettes. She'd probably have more fun swindling all the inheritance out of the senile fools at the care centre, not the jail.  &nbsp;

      As you're most likely aware, I've not been posting on this site for some time now. This was mainly because I was too busy working on the 52nd Post Spectacular for the other site. And hey, if you haven't read it yet, what the hell are you doing here? Go read it. I've received word that people have found it quite funny, and it even has interviews with both Dane AND Steve Smith, our mysterious benefactor. Shameless plug over.  Back to business. I've been away, and I return to the site today to find that Dane has turned himself into an angry, charismatic prophet of some kind; announcing that the animals are quickly going to take over Earth and subject us humans to their iron-willed tyranny. Although I - having an as yet unmatched loathing for all of humankind - would not be upset if those events were to unfold, I must say that Dane really needs to stop smoking peat moss.  Step one of the reconstruction of this site is now complete.

      It's right out of Orwell's Animal Farm. Monkies will be the new humans. I hope the other critters are able to see that the monkies are going to screw them over.   Jerusalem - A young monkey at an Israeli zoo has started walking like a human after a near-death experience.  The zoo's veterinarian said Natasha, a small five-year-old black macaque monkey at the Safari Park next to Tel Aviv, began walking exclusively upright after a stomach ailment nearly killed her.Monkeys usually alternate between upright movement and walking on all fours.   A picture in the Ma'ariv newspaper on Wednesday showed Natasha standing ramrod straight like a human. The picture was humorously labelled "The missing link?"  "I've never seen or heard of this before. One possible explanation is brain damage from the illness," veterinarian Igal Horowitz said.   Sapa-AP  Beware

      CBC   Lesbian couple seeking country's first same-sex divorce   Last Updated Wed, 21 Jul 2004 11:44:04 EDT   TORONTO - A lesbian couple in Ontario may face problems getting what is believed to be Canada's first same-sex divorce because the law limits divorce to male-female couples.   Martha McCarthy   INDEPTH:  urlLink Same-sex Rights    The two women, identified only as M.M. and J.H., were married in Ontario on June 18, 2003, a week after Ontario's Court of Appeal legalized same-sex marriage.  They separated five days later.   RELATED:  urlLink Ottawa to recognize same-sex marriages    However, the Divorce Act, which is federal legislation, defines spouses as "either of a man or a woman who are married to each other."   Toronto lawyer Martha McCarthy and her client, M.M. have asked the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to issue an order that the federal definition of spouse under the Divorce Act is unconstitutional. She said the federal government is due to respond next week.   "It's unconstitutional to give straight people the freedom to divorce, and not gays and lesbians," said McCarthy.   She said she has written to the federal government asking it not to fight their court challenge.  "In September, there could be gay marriage and gay divorce in the province of Ontario," said McCarthy.   The Ontario court was the first to legalize same-sex marriage in Canada. British Columbia, Quebec and the Yukon soon followed.   The federal government referred a draft bill changing the definition of marriage to the Supreme Court for its consideration. Hearings on the issue are scheduled to begin this fall.

      Goats now have the ability to spin webbing. It's part two in the animals taking over the world. Birds lighting entire forests on fire in California&nbsp;and now goats that can trap humans in webs. The main thing that sucks is that we're giving the goats these incredible abilities.  &nbsp;  Here's a piece of the article I found on the BBC's website.  (Dane originally posted a link&nbsp;to the article here, but since he's an inbred twit with no regard for proper formatting, I&nbsp;deleted it to&nbsp;return the page to it's former nicely-formatted glory. Since Dane is a journalist you would think he would have a grasp on the fact that there's only a limited space to work with. But I guess not. - Joel) &nbsp;   In an unlikely coupling, genetic engineers have now bred goats that have spider silk genes inside them. By doing this, they can harvest the silk proteins from the goat's milk (silky milk, anyone?). The silk gene was just one of 70,000 that make up the DNA blueprint for building a normal goat.   In adult female goats, the silk gene is activated only while the animal is producing milk. One goat can produce about 7g of silk per day.      Spiders in space and surgery      &nbsp;   Called 'biosteel', the silk is lighter, yet tougher than Kevlar, and nearly as elastic as nylon. It could be used in medical supplies, space equipment and bullet-proof vests.  So there's a new superhero in town. Swinging from skyscraper to skyscraper, fighting crime as it shoots jets of silk from its udders, it's Spider-Goat!   &nbsp;  The author thinks the entire thing is a joke. I can't believe it. He won't be laughing for too much longer.  &nbsp;  I've noticed that&nbsp;Joel was harboring a small force of&nbsp;terrorist animals at his trailer.&nbsp;Now they're all heading their separate ways&nbsp;to lead larger forces in the destruction of&nbsp;mankind. I wouldn't be surprised if Joel trained&nbsp;them himself. After three years of dealing with people&nbsp;at Rolf's, he's begun to despise all people and wants to kill them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Damn you Joel. Damn You.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  By the way everyone should check out his 52 post extravaganza at  urlLink http://www.brokencontroller.blogspot.com/ . It's pretty funny.

      I saw this on CNN’s website. It had me worried.   "The wildfire began when a red-tailed hawk hit power lines and caught fire, said Jim Dellamonica, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.The bird fell to the ground, setting plants on fire, he said. Helicopters dropped water on hillsides, seeking to halt the Foothill blaze's spread."   The fire is still raging. I think this could be the start of the apocalypse. Animals are going to destroy the human world and kill everyone in it. &nbsp;They seem willing to sacrifice themselves. We're doomed.  I’ll keep this post short so everyone doesn’t get into a panic. I suggest&nbsp;everyone should try and go about their daily lives and let the end come. It’s no use trying to fight. We’re horribly outnumbered.

      On Monday night, I saw one of the nastiest sights I’ve ever seen. It was horrible. All the gyrating, fake smiles and jiggling. What did I do to deserve that punishment? I’m scarred. Terribly, terribly scarred. It was worse than seeing Court’s dance in an Amsterdam nightclub. I’ll try and get Joel to perform the dance and have to downloaded onto the site, but we’ll see. It wasn’t pretty.   Where did I go? What did I see? You ask.   It was Monday, 9 p.m. I went to the bottom bar, and I had my first encounter with a Rocky Mountain House stripper. I don’t think I’ve ever been so disgusted. She didn’t put any effort into her routine, which would have made the show bearable. She looked bad and everything else that could suck, did. I was only there to meet my girlfriend and play some pool. If only I had known. My sheltered life made me believe strippers were supposed to look good.   How I rate strippers?   1) Appearance. Yes, I’m superficial. I like to see good looking strippers. I don’t mind fake breasts. I’m not going to touch them anyway, so they might as well look good. I’m not asking for a life sized Barbie. I actually prefer athletic girls. Piercings are nice, but too many isn’t good. Not for me.  No one wants to see ugly people get naked. It’s alcohol’s job to make ugly people bearable. Covering them up with clothes is also a good idea. Lots and lots of thick baggy clothing. I myself have numerous hoodies that I frequently wear.   2) Performance. I like strength moves. I like Pole tricks, acrobatics and flexibility. Good dancing is a must. The performance should be fluid and not at all awkward. Music is key. I like loud, heavy and fast. I don’t really like the ladies who play the top 40. The louder and faster the music the more the crowd gets pumped up and excited.  They might not want to get the drunk, dirty bastards all rowdied up, but they’ll make more money.   3) Enthusiasm. I like a stripper who enjoys getting up and being naked in front of a bunch of horny bastards. At least pretend. They should look like they want to be up there. I don’t care if they have to do a couple lines, smoke a joint or down a bunch of shots, but they need to look like they’re having fun. They can’t flinch when loonies are tossed at them. It just looks stupid.   4) Bonuses. It’s always great when there are more than one on stage at once. A shower is great. Prizes are a must. Posters, key chains, videos, etc... You need somthing to remember the ladies by.  Rocky’s stripper didn’t have anything. The music I guess was okay, but that’s it. She was old. I’d guess she was about 40. She could hold a handstand for ten seconds, but didn’t use the pole or confirm her flexibility. She made a lousy $6 dollars in loonies.   I always wondered what happened to strippers when they got too old. They go on a small town circuit. They travel around to crappy locations and take their clothes off. I always hoped they quite and find a waitress job.   Maybe my standards are too high. I’ve only seen Calgary strippers. It’s very competitive and only the best remain. The rest exchange occupations or join the minor leagues. I’ve also seen the stripper in Powell River. A town about the size of Rocky. She looked good, but couldn’t dance. If she could, she probably could have been making the big bucks in Vancouver or Victoria.  &nbsp; I've managed to come to grips with the nasty stripper. I blocked it from my thoughts for a week and needed a form of release. This is it. I warn everyone to stay away from the strippers in a small town.

      Are you looking for some Bloom County? I sure hope so, because that's all I've got to give you today. Perhaps if I show a bunch of strips and spread the County love, the good folks who own the rights will see fit to reprint the entire canon. And that'll be just like a sloppy kiss on a rainy day. With a helping of boysenberry pie.  For the benefit of the ignorant jackasses or those people who hated Spider-Man 2 (although those two things aren't mutually exclusive) I should give a reminder that you need to click on the picture to view the strip at full size.  A bit of commentary for the first strip: I've already shown it to a certain somebody who said the part of the rabbit sums up their entire political career. No points for guessing who it is.    urlLink      urlLink

      It was a hot summer day, and Joel and Dane were cruising around Rocky. The black ‘83 Chevette was hot, the AM radio cranked out the sounds of the oldies, and the sweat stains were appearing in the armpit regions of their superhero costumes. It was almost time for a free slurpee from Rolf’s.  They took a final tour down main street, the hub of the action in the small town. If there was crime prevention needed, it was on main street. Dane was looking for villainous activity, while Joel’s eyes were perusing, peering, probing the area for scantily clad women. Joel was in heat and on the prowl. Watch out ladies.  The pair had already saved one kid from the perils of J-walking. A new daily record would be established if they foiled two more crimes.   “If only the cops would do their job,” Joel muttered. He was pissed because he didn’t get to go to Sylvan Lake to admire all the uncovered flesh. “I wouldn’t have to be in this hot car, in this skin-tight suit, patrolling a boring town.”  “We have powers that have to be used for the good of the world,” Dane said trying to calm the easily irritable Joel. “You know you need to use your editing skills to further mankind, not to destroy the already fragile planet.” Dane had become very concerned about Earth once he heard about the atrocities in Iraq and the Liberals winning the federal election. He still couldn’t believe they were true.  Joel on the other hand didn’t know what to think. He knew his powers could help eradicate evil, but he also knew the world was weak and his for the taking. It was then that his dream girl walked down the street. Silky, brown hair flowed over her tanned shoulders. Long legs jutted out of a pair of cutoff shorts and her low-cut shirt was too much. Joel got out of the car and strutted over to her. The kind of strut only a superhero wearing a mask could execute. Dane had never seen Joel do anything this perposterous sincehe puked on some guy’s shoes in the old Republic.  Unfortunately, he hadn’t quite planned out the scenario. He wanted to say something, but couldn’t. His voice froze; he couldn’t force out a word. He just stuttered. It was an incomprehensible mumble. His face went red and a puddle formed at the bottom of his right leg. Joel ran in horror. He flipped a manhole cover and fled into the sewer.  In the background the only sound was laughter. Dane fell out of the driver’s side door and couldn’t stop laughing. Tears steamed down his face, and his sides burst. The pain and misery of his friends made his life worth living. A car quickly turned in beside the Chevette and cranked Dane in the head. Everything went black.  The girl didn’t know what to think and continued on her way. Her thoughts were on the bald clerk from Rolf’s who sold her a Hershey bar the night prior.

      The judge sits high on his perch, gavel in hand. His bloodshot eyes peer down upon me. My hands are bound in cuffs at crotch level. I give myself a quick scratch before he hands down his sentence. The room must have increased in temperature by 20 degrees. Sweat drips down in between my ass cheeks and collects in my boxerbriefs. Everyone is waiting for the judgment, especially me.   With his comments, my life changes. Will I feel his wrath or will I leave a man with a free mind? The hulking judge slowly opens his mouth, saliva threads tear apart as his lips separate. Here it comes. The words vibrate along his vocal cords and the sound waves reach my ears.  “Very good,” says the judge. “You’ve met or exceeded all expectations.”   (I love my thesaurus. Another word for vibration is vibration. Stupid Webster’s English thesaurus.)  I let out a sigh of relief. My body begins to fill with pleasantness. I feel like Joel does when Rolf gives him a gold star for his excellent work ethic. I feel as good as a kid does when they are rewarded for wiping their own ass. I feel good.  Today was my midway evaluation. I wasn’t sure how it was going to turn out. I’ve been going through the motions, but there’s been nothing to really challenge me. No tests. Everything is small and fairly easy. I haven’t had to deal with any serious, controversial topics. But really, are there many in a small town? If there are, another one of the reporters is on top of the story.   I’ll get a good review, which hopefully means a good evaluation, which lands me a good job, which means a happy life. I’d really like a happy life. I don’t know exactly what I’ll be doing to keep me happy, but I’ll found out soon enough.

      Giving someone the finger is the typical gesture of offense. We don’t bite our thumbs anymore, like in Romeo and Juliet, but I think we should rekindle the art of snooking. To snook is to perform a rude gesture made as a sign of contempt, thumb on the nose and fingers out-stretched. It was the primary signal of insult in the late 18th century.   I also feel we should reinstate the glove-smack-to-the-face challenge. If you are going to fight, you have to make it clear. You can’t just sucker punch someone. There needs to be some sort of code again. I’m not a fighter, but I’ve been hit in the head a couple of times. Most were a result of what I said and should have known it was coming, but on one occasion that wasn’t the case.   I was drunk in a bar. It was the Metro in Calgary. Another drunk blamed me for spilling his beer. He told me to buy him another one. I refused and walked away. My friend, Cartwright was talking with one of the bouncers. He was actually trying to pick up a beer tub girl, but ended up talking to the other staff member standing beside her. Anyway I went over and joined in the conversation.   It was a $1.50 high ball night and I was having a great time. As this other drunk guy walked past, he asked if we were tattling to the bouncer on him. I said no, and seconds after his fist hit my face twice. His buddy hit Cartwright once before the bouncer jumped in and escorted the evil duo out. No damage was done to my face. I got a free beer and everything was all good.  Cartwright and I wandered around the place looking for people we knew. All of the sudden the pair was back in the bar and had spotted us. They came in through the front. The doorman didn’t know they had been thrown out because they were escorted through a side door. Anyway, they came right up to us. Cartwright bolted. One guy grabbed my arms, while the other drove his knuckles into my head. I managed to tuck my chin into my neck so I took the brunt of the hits with forehead. I wouldn’t doubt that he broke a knuckle on my thick skull. I suffered a cut in my right eyebrow, and was asked to leave. I still have a small scar to this day. Cartwright was already outside. We got in a cab and headed home.  The next day I had a hangover and Cartwright had a story about how he scared the two off. His buddy Chad asked me what really happened? Did he run? Yep. Anyone that knew him, knew he was full of crap. But the story he told was a lot better than I got my ass kicked while he ran story. So, I didn’t really care.

      As I promised/threatened before, I was going to write an installment in the adventures of Drunk Man and Bug Guy or whatever the hell their names are. And here it is! Now you may go about your business now that the Master of Brilliant Awesomeness has blessed you. Of course, after you're done with him, you could always read this. Issue 0, hitting blogstands now!  But before I start, I'd just... screw it, I'll save it for another post. Enjoy!         It was a dark, or a stormy, or perhaps a dark and stormy night. Lightning crashed, which pissed off the thunder, because apparently only thunder is supposed to crash. They bitched at each other for a while then whisped away to the atmosphere, leaving behind a stench of ozone. The suicidal rain drops fell to the earth and burst apart on impact, leaving behind streams of watery gore. Newsprint blackness was smeared over the landscape and was everywhere. Except in one area, where it was washed away by two thin streams of light.  A small black car slid sharply around the corner of the gravel road. It began to drift and soon found itself hurtling into a tree. It crashed, as expected. Three rather large branches came down with a thud on the hood. And then, all was quiet. All was still. For a few moments anyway, for loud screaming came from inside the car. Soon after, the passenger side door opened.  "...Ing ASSHOLE!!! FUCK! FUCK FUCKITY FUCK FUCK FUCK!! WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!!" yelled Joel as he stepped outside. The driver side door opened, then Dane stepped outside as well. "Calm down, Joel. This car cost us thirty bucks. Those new red pens you bought cost more than that. And look! We're in the driveway of my house!" "CALM DOWN?! I'LL CALM DOWN AFTER I'VE URINATED ON YOUR CORPSE, YOU FUCKING WACKADOO!"  Dane calmly took a cigarette out of his pocket and shoved it in Joel's mouth. Before Joel could react, Dane grabbed his lighter and lit it. Joel immediately inhaled half the cigarette, then crumpled into a heap on the road. Dane shook his head, grabbed Joel's arms, and dragged him towards the house.  After ten minutes of arduous pulling, Dane zipped up his pants and went into the living room to see if Joel was still alive after he had threw him on the couch twenty minutes earlier. He went back into the kitchen after he saw Joel muttering about "all the pretty puppies". Damn, Dane thought to himself, all this pulling has worn me out. I'm used to pushing things! Before he could curl up on the table and go to sleep, he was confronted by his girlfriend, Famira!  "So, I'm still not good enough for your little adventures, am I?" she sneered. Dane lept to his feet, opened a cupboard, and hid behind it's door. "It's just that you don't have any powers, sweetie!" stammered Dane. "What, like you guys? WOW, the ability to get drunk. That's a showstopper. And being able to push things?" "Dammit, Famira; I have a gift! I push well! And with a bit of power, comes a little responsibility!" shouted Dane as he stood up and raised his fist to the ceiling. Famira shook her head. "Dane, I have a secret to tell you. You didn't get bitten by a radioactive dung beetle. You got bitten by a radioactive spider. But besides making you sterile, it didn't do anything for you." "But... but what about Anthony? I pushed him into in a little ball!" "Oh, him. Well, it turns out he was just a big sissy." "And why the big story about the dung beetle?" "Because, dear, if I told you you were bitten by a radioactive spider you would've tried jumping from buildings and stuff. This at least kept you safe on the ground." "But I have no powers!" "Do you need powers to be a hero?" "Hmmm... I guess not... wait a minute, what the fuck am I saying?! Of course you need powers to be a hero! Does Superman save a busful of screaming passengers from going off a cliff by talking nice to the bus?" "Sigh... you don't get it." "No! You know what I don't I get? How you appeared out of nowhere! You're supposed to be at work right now! And you don't even sound like you usually do! You don't talk like that! What the hell is going on?"  Famira suddenly began to flicker. She was an image, projected from some unknown source.  "HA HA HA! That's right! I'm not Famira! And this is the end of the line for you!"  To Be Continued!!!

      Alone in his room, Joel was reading a comic. He held the comic with his left hand and in his right was a red, fine-tipped, felt pen. The ashtray sitting on his night stand, only an arm’s reach away, was now empty. It was usually heaped with discarded cigarette butts. A desk lamp positioned over his right shoulder was the only source of light. A little of the light radiated back into his face from a mirror hanging on the wall.   Suddenly a quack startled the confused superhero. His head snapped up to glance out the window. Only a hazy full moon was visible. Joel’s quick thinking registered the noise and matched it with it’s only possible source.  “Damn duck,” Joel muttered, a bit of saddness jolted his heart for the duck that went missing two weeks prior. He was about to return to his comic when he caught a glimse of himself in the mirror.  “Who am I?” Joel asked himself. I’m Disorientedman no more. He looked at the red pen in his hand. Joel thought maybe he could become the editor and correct the mistakes of bad men. He couldn’t help himslef from correcting the shoddy grammar in his comic books and the Mountaineer was absolutely horrible. Joel dispised the writter with the byline Aaron Dane Lutz. He still believed his partner in crime fighting, Dane Lutz, was somehow related.  He also knew of the power of addiction. The empty ashtray reminded Joel of how great it felt to suck on the filter of a DuMuarier light kingsize. His need began to grow. He wished there was a villan in front of him, so he could kick a little ass. Lately the only people feeling the effects of his smokless life style were the customers at Rolf’s.   On Sunday evening to piss his customers off, he pretended to be out of the most popular brand of nic-sticks. He laughed in the face of one lady as she swipped a container of chocolates all over the counter. It was a malicious cackle. It was not one of a superhero, but one that belonged to the most mischievious evil-doer Rocky has ever seen.  Could this be the end for our courageous superhero? Could this be the demise of Joel as a goodguy? Is this the beginning of a new force of evil?   Tune in next time. Same blog internet address. Same crazy blog title.

      It wasn’t a position he usually found himself in. Well maybe one or two times before. He was fighting evil with a tire wrench. Mud dripped down his face. He wiped the sludge from his eyes and cleaned his hand on his Dung Beetle Guy uniform. The uniform he wore when he crushed badness into a ball and threw it in a trash can. This particular devil landed DBG in a mud puddle on a rainy day. He had a flat tire.  “What the hell is taking so long?” Inquired the ex-Disorientedman from the passenger seat of the goodmobile. They hadn’t agreed on a decent name for their mode of transportation. It was a black 1983 Chevette.   Since sobering up, Joel was having an identity crisis. He couldn’t decide whether he was the all powerful Editor or if he wanted to be Nicfit. Joel had just quit smoking and was having a rough time. He could, however, turn that nicotine free ferociousness on anyone who got in his way.  “Shut up you lazy bastard,” replied DBG, a vein was starting to pop out of his neck and his eye began to spasm. “With one push, I could send this car into orbit and it’d be your casket for all eternity,” DBG whispered under his breath as a smile crossed his lips.  “What was that?” Joel asked. He heard some mumbling but couldn’t quite make out the words.  “Nothing. You sit in the nice warm car and relax. You stupid cunt,” said DBG. The tire iron pressed against the nut and with a little effort began to spin. “Ha ha. I’ve triumphed again.” Soon all four of the bolts were on the ground. DBG pulled off the flat and tossed on the itty-bitty spare. He fastened the nuts back in place, released the jack, tossed the ruined tire in the trunk and hopped back behind the wheel. They were off to Kal-tire.  Evil was vanquished for yet, another day.

      Those of you new to our site probably have some questions cranking the hamster wheel in your brain; and I have no doubt that number one on your list of inquiries is this: Just what the hell do we look like? Mostly to know who you're looking for when you finally decide to make Darwin's theories more "pro-active", I'm guessing. Well, tough luck, assholes! AH HA HA HAH!   Ahem.  Barring the pictures on our logo, the pictures of us in our posts and the spiffy animated GIF in our sidebar, we're just not that well represented image-wise on our site. I decided to rectify this  tout de suite .     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   We're ready for our close-ups, Mr. DeMille.    Well, I hope that helps when you make the trip to Rocky to pop some caps in our ignorant asses. We'll be eating cupcakes and watching Winnie the Pooh until then.  Now on to the first edition of Dane's Relevant Links!  Now hold on, you're saying. You, Jam-Master Joel, are writing this post. Why the hell is it Dane's Relevant Links, then? Because, my simple friend, when Dane recommends a link, it is Relevant. When I recommend a link, it is Useless. Read the damn sidebar. Since these links are actually somewhat relevant, I'm acting as a proxy for Dane until such time when he is in a capacity to recommend them himself. At the moment Dane is currently holding hands with his girlfriend or brushing her hair or perhaps engaging in any number of wholesome activities that boys and girls do together nowadays. I don't know, I took a vow of celibacy two years ago; not as an expression of any beliefs, mind you, but more as a way to justify my social life or lack thereof. But that's neither here nor there.  I'd really like to claim that I created the images above and the images in our header myself, but then I'd be lying. And liars make cuddly kittens cry while Jesus plots to literally shit in their cereal. Or something. Anyways, I made them with the help of some avatar creation programs I managed to find while trolling the Interweb. Kudos goes to  urlLink Heroine X  for being the person whose post about them I found first.      urlLink Portrait Illustration Maker  - Used to make the images contained in this post. Not that pretty of a system, really; but there's lots of things to play around with.   urlLink Dookyweb  - Used to make the images in the logo. Nice and easy! Less options than the one above, though.    Up next: Joel attempts to write a chapter in the saga of Drunk Guy and Bug Man, or whatever the hell their names are.

      It was a great day for me. I've never experienced the excitement and pleasure before. Today was my first time being bitched at because someone didn't agree with my column in the paper. It was my first column, but hopefully I have many more angry readers calling into the paper.   I'm sure Joel will tell you my column title sucks, but his recommendation was too clever and no one got it.    (Admin's Note: It was "A Paradigm Shifting Without A Clutch.")   I wrote about Todd Bertuzzi being charged. I don't think he should have been. Anyway, the guy on the other end of the phone started going off and I just listened. I countered every time he said something I didn't agree with.  The conversation ended with him complimenting me on my opinion piece. It's nice to see that I've got people talking.   (Admin's Note: In case you're curious about his editorial, I've typed it below. Yes, I have no life.)     Dane States His Case   Bertuzzi, what did you do?   On Thursday, June 24, Todd Bertuzzi was charged with assault causing bodily harm for his vicious on-ice attack directed at Steve Moore of the Colorado Avalanche. Moore suffered a broken neck and a concussion. It is still unknown whether he'll play next season. The incident at GM Place ocurred three and a half months ago in front of 18,000 fans.  The league acted quick and fierce. Bertuzzi was suspended for the final 13 games of the season. He missed the Canucks' seven post-season games. He lost more than $500,000 in salary. The Canucks were also fined $250,000 for the clubbing from behind. Bertuzzi wasn't selected for Team Canada at the World Hockey Championships in August, because the league hasn't reinstated Bertuzzi making him eligible to play. Now, he faces the possibility of jail time. It's too much.  The attack was terrible and deserved discipline. The league was taking care of it. Now, Bertuzzi has a lot more to worry about. The maximum penalty depends on how the Crown proceeds. Bertuzzi faces a maximum penalty of 18 months in provincial jail. Or if the Crown chooses to go the path of indictment, Bertuzzi could spend the rest of his NHL career in jail. The Supreme Court could send him away for a maximum of 10 years.  Jail time is unnecessary. Bertuzzi has been punished enough. Plus, how much punishment is going to be handed down? The Marty McSorley stick-upside-the-head incident received an 18-month conditional discharge, after being convicted of assault.  In 1998, Dino Ciccarelli was sentenced to one day in jail and fined $1,000 Cdn. for striking Luke Richardson in the head with his stick.  One more. In 1982, Jimmy Mann, Winnipeg Jets enforcer, left the bench and clocked Penguin's Paul Gardner. Mann broke Gardner's jaw in two places. The penalty was a $500 fine and a suspended sentence.  Whatever sentence the courts hand out pales in comparison to what his suspension has done to the Canucks. Bertuzzi could have been the difference in the first round of the playoffs. He could have scred the game winning goal in Game 7 to send the Canucks on to Round 2. He could have had the influence to extinguish the pesky flames before Game 7. It could have been the Canucks battling the Tampa Bay Lightning for the Stanley Cup. It could have been Vancouver's year. Now they'll never know.  The league has to look at ways to keep a similar occurence from happening again. I suggest they eliminate the instigator rule. A player who tries to fight an unwilling combatant is ejected from the game with the possibility of suspension. Before the instigator rule an enforcer could protect the team's star players. Bertuzzi's attack on Moore was in retaliation for a controversial bodycheck. In a previous game Moore injured Vancouver captain Marcus Naslund. Vancouver wanted to punish Moore for the hit. Bertuzzi was the one who acted.  Bertuzzi didn't drop the gloves and hit Moore face to face because of the instigator rule. Instead he chose to hit Moore from behind and take him to the ice, breaking Moore's neck. If Moore had skated away, the play would have likely resulted in a roughing call, and maybe a suspension. It wouldn't have been nearly as long as the one he's serving now.  The terrible assault never should have happened and the penalties could become even more sever with a conviction.

        Hey everybody, this is Dane. I decided to invite Joel back over to my house so we could write another post together. Say hey, Joel.    Hey guys! How's it going? It's great to back here, even though the last time we tried this it ended up with Dane swinging a crowbar while chasing me down a country lane. But you know, that's why pencils have erasers. It's all water under the bridge. We got over it, and let bygones be by-    Quit it.    Oops, sorry. Why don't you lead off the discussion, Dane? We've got some good topics to talk about today! Like how to make a decent egg salad, or what the best Winnie the Pooh cartoon short is, or even what the price of r-    Why the fuck were you writing about my  urlLink girlfriend?     Oh! Um, I see that Dane has, um, chosen a meaningful issue to er, debate.    Can it, shithead! Give me one good reason not kick your ass!    Dane, I merely wrote that to help clear up some misconceptions we had about each other.    What, her "misconception" that you're a douchebag? That did fat fuck-all!    Hey, we can act like two grown men and not resort to names... oh, who am I kidding, YOU FUCKING FRUIT! That's it! It's go time!         Huh... wheeze...    Wheeze... pant...    So are we cool?    I know I am. You sure as hell aren't!    WHAT?!         Heeeey, eveeereeebodeee! I'm drunk on punch!    Um... where's my ear?

      Thanks to my investigative journalism, the Pentagon is now aware of the animal threat level. They are implementing programs to stop the attack. Here is some proof. It's the top two paragraphs of an article on the Globe and Mail's website.    Pentagon tests directed-energy weapons  By MICHAEL P. REGAN Associated Press    A few months from now, Peter Anthony Schlesinger hopes to zap a laser beam at a couple of chickens or other animals in a cage a few dozen yards away. If all goes as planned, the chickens will be frozen in mid-cluck, their leg and wing muscles paralyzed by an electrical charge created by the beam, even as their heart and lungs function normally.    Among those most interested in the outcome will be officials at the Pentagon, who helped fund Mr. Schlesinger's work and are looking at this type of device to do a lot more than just zap the cluck out of a chicken. Devices like these, known as directed-energy weapons, could be used to fight wars in coming years.   These new ray guns will allow people to harm the animals, but not kill them. We have to crush the attack, but don't want to destroy our food supply.

      I found this little bit of news on the BBC's website and thought I'd give everyone a warning.  I don't want people to hear the new slogan and crumble to their knees wondering what had happened. I don't want people thinking that they've been transported to a strange parallel dimension. Be prepared. Change isn't always good.    Ad slogan has a break - for good     One of the most recognizable slogans in advertising history - "Have a break, have a KitKat" - is to be dropped after 47 years.    Manufacturer Nestle Rowntree has said it will roll out a new tagline - "Make the most of your break" - next month.    KitKat's first television commercial launched the famous tagline in 1957.    Andrex toilet roll is also reported to be replacing its 32-year-old "Soft, strong and long" slogan with the tagline, "Tuggable, huggable softness".     Why did they have to mess with a good thing? It's stupid and won't do anything. Kit Kat's ad people just wanted to make it look like they're doing something.  The second slogan change was a good idea. Joel already has numerous sexual innuendos pumping, thrusting and grinding through his head.

      I'd like to formally announce to the world that Dane has a girlfriend. They've been dating for over a year now. This really shouldn't come as a surprise; after all, he's the studliest guy to ever wield a camera in the entire span of human existence. What, you think a man that chock-full of machismo wouldn't have a girlfriend? Wouldn't spend every waking hour alone? Wouldn't see his dreams drown in cigarette butts and empty bottles of Pepsi? [sniff] Wouldn't be posting his worthless thoughts for the perusal of the uncaring sacks of hatred and gristle who visit his sites out of pity? WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE THROUGH THE STREAMS OF TEARS CASCADING DOWN HIS SALLOW FACE!?  Ahem. *cough*  Anyway, Dane has a girlfriend. And ever since I met her, things have been rather weird. For some odd reason, both of us think that the other doesn't like them. So, I'd like to announce that I don't hate Dane's girlfriend, Famira. Actually, she's really cool! She's awesome! She's funny! In fact, I don't think Dane realizes how lucky he has it. After all, there's nothing better than a girl who does binary conversions in her spare time. For fun, even! Reeeow!

      I have something to admit. I have been living a lie. For the past several days, I've been basking in glory that wasn't rightfully mine. The world was shouting my name, naked women threw themselves upon me, and offers of fabulous wealth poured in daily. But then there was a flash of lightning. Thunder crashed, and a dark figure entered the scene. His flowing cape fluttered in the wind, and his eyes burned with the fire of a thousand suns. It was the dramatic young visionary known only as Spencer, coming to cast his judgement upon me. He thrust his finger at me and bellowed, "O False Messiah! You traitor to all of man! Deceiver! I cannot abide your lies any longer! For you have perverted the works of great men and claimed the results as  urlLink your own!  The world shall soon know of your greivous sins." With that, he wrapped his cape around him and vanished into thin air. I was left, surrounded by a heavy fog of shame. My faithful readers, can you ever forgive me? I'm sorry if it raised your opinion of this shallow, hollow person. Why God? Why do you allow this patchwork piecemeal man to keep drawing breath? When he has nary an original thought in his styrofoam peanut-filled head? Oh Dane! I have forever tainted this site! [intese bawling]

       urlLink Our Names on a Marquee   Sigh. Why do I bother? Nobody returns my e-mails, nobody returns my phone calls. I'm watching the molecules slowly break off from my arm, transform into information, and drift away on electromagnetic waves. Slowly the rest of my body will follow suit. My consciousness will glide away until my lidless eyes close and I fade from existence.  Hallelujah.

      Well, I suppose when you have one of these blog-ma-bobs it's necessary to post all the tedious tid-bits that make up your travels. Just so I don't have to do this ever again I've decided to post a breakdown of my average day. Stand back from your computer screen, don't look directly at it, and prepare to be dazzled!  10:00 A.M. - Day starts. My day, anyway. Yes, while you poor bastards have been slaving away for two hours, I am nice and cozy in my bed with a cat by my side. Ha ha!   10:15 A.M. - Breakfast!  10:30 A.M. - Daytime T.V!  10:33 A.M. - Since daytime television sucks, I switch it off. The next three and a half hours, who the hell knows. It's occupied by anything from taking Ben the dog out for a walk, annoying the ducks, doing chores (HA!), watching Mr. Show for the bazillionth time, watching Mr. Show with commentary, watching Mr. Show extras, corrupting my brain with video games, increasing my knowledge of C++ and HTML, and perhaps cooking. Maybe some macram&eacute; if I'm feeling salty.  2:00 P.M. - If I didn't get enough sleep the night before it's time for my afternoon nap. Yes, the Sandman visits me twice in one day! Aren't I lucky?  4:00 P.M. - Oops, play-time's over. Time to put on my game face. Any trace of mirth sinks back into my pores, because it's not going to be needed for the next seven hours.  4:30 P.M. - I mount my mighty blue stallion and soar to work on the wings of children's dreams.  5:00 P.M. - The dreams turn into nightmares, for I am back at Rolf's Groceries. For the next eon or so I am the public's bitch. Yes, a bitch. Horny parents sic their sugar-starved kids on me with twenty bucks in their sweaty, greasy grasp. The village idiots pore over the bags of chips, hoping to find the brand and flavor which defines them as people. Nicotine-addled fools beg me to front them a package of cigarettes until payday, even though their kids haven't eaten for a week. And through it all there's me, tapping out telegrams from the frontlines of cultural armageddon.   11:00 P.M. - The store closes. This particular eon lasted around six hours; rather piddling by eon standards, but not if you were there living it. Rope up the cash, sling it in the back, toss off a rough estimate of how much money we lost, and there we go! Work's done! Oh yeah, the cleaning. Then I'm done. Wait, the tapes for the security cameras! And then... fuck it, I'm never done. But let's pretend, shall we? I'm doing a damn fine job of it already. It's my peaceful and solitudinal computer time next. Ah yes! Unlimited access to the entire breadth of knowledge transcribed by mankind! So what if I use it for porn?  3:00 A.M. - Depending on whatever the fuck I was doing (or watching!) I'm usually back at home around 2:00 A.M. At which point I'm practically attacked by my attention starved cat, at least until I open my bedroom window, at which point she couldn't give a crap about me. I swear, she's more interested in sniffing the window-screen than eating, sometimes. So, once I've regained my peace, I read from the selection of books I've got going at the same time. Around 3:00 A.M. I drift off to sleep and dream about vampire puppies.

      It's currently past three in the morning and I am not at home nor am I in bed. I am not at the bar, nor am I at a friend's house. I am still at work, banging away on my laptop's keyboard and jiggering with the mouse. There's something profoundly wrong with this situation. Do normal people do this? Does a regular guy stay at his office and dick around on his computer for, let's say, five hours after punching the clock? And reason no. 3,359,287 for why Joel does not have a girlfriend is...  Double standard time: When a gal plays on a computer for more than an hour at a time it's incredibly cute, quirky, and endearing. But when a dude does it, it's just really sad and wrong.

      Bleagh! This day can just go and kick itself in the ass. I'm sporting a damn big headache, it feels like I'm slathered with grease, and to top it off its goddamned  urlLink Mountaineer  day. Oh goody, Pepsi just showed up with a delivery! Throw in castration and it's my favorite day ever!

      (Please note that this post was composed on May 13, 2004)  Criminy, how is it that a day that started off so pleasant can devolve into something so hideous?! Well, that's a bit of hyperbole right there but the day sure ended up crappy. Sheesh, I even did a (sort-of) good thing by rooting through all our home movies and digging out the one my mom's been dying to see lately. Okay, so it's not that great. Judge not, lest ye be judged. I was flying high when I pulled up to work listening to I Had the Time of My Life from Dirty Dancing, which is probably a scarier scene than you want to imagine. So I have shitty tapes, what're you gonna do? Unfortunately, the second I walked in the door all the fuzzy feelings melted away. Sherry started ranting to me about ignorant customers and my evil creditor who won't stop bugging the shit out of everyone. Didn't really put a positive spin on things. After that, little annoying crap just kept building up and up until the end of the night when I could probably shatter glass just by staring at it. Hoo - boy. In more positive news Dane and I are probably going to see Troy tomorrow night and rendez-vous with Rob later. Been about six months since I've seen Rob; last November to be exact. There's really no reason why it's been that long; it's just the miracle of procrastination at work. "Yeah, I don't feel like leaving the house today. I'll call 'im next week." Of course, the fact it's my turn to buy the pizza this time probably makes up some of it, too. Lo and behold, six months have gone by, Rob is sporting dreadlocks and new tattoos, there's no more bloody snow on the ground, and nothing else of great import has happened. That's the beauty of having married friends; you can drop in pretty much whenever and guarantee nothing's changed since the last time you saw them. Well, until the rabbit dies, anyway. God help you when you're visiting in that situation. But regardless, it should be a decent night. Now that Rob despises Rocky's "night-life" it's probably going to be a ganja-fest through and through.

      (Please note that I did not create a post on May 14, 2004. In lieu of said post, here's some crap I pulled from my computer.)  Page 6 panel 4:  Burgess gives the name of "old lords":  Namtar, Allatu, Morax, Naberius, Klesh, Vepar, Maymon.  Morax is certainly the name of a bull-headed demon appearing in _The Demon_.  Maymon may be a reference to Mammon, a Greek word for riches.  Mammon is also the name of a devil in the Key of Solomon, based on the line "one cannot serve God and Mammon" in the scripture.  	Panel 5:  More names:  Ashema-Deva, Maborym, Horvendile.  Ashema-Deva is Persian, a god or devil in the Zoroastrian pantheon.  He is more familiar to Westerners under the name Asmodeus.  Horvendile is a name that appears in both Lord Dunsany and James Branch Cabell.  In Dunsany (an early fantasist and playwright, active in the early decades of this century, best known work perhaps _The King of Elfland's Daughter_), Horvendile is a god.  In Cabell's "Poictesme" cycle, he is referred to as a demiurge, a being who, though walking through the story, is above it, and possibly pulling the strings.  He also keeps swine that feed on human flesh.  Page 7 panel 6:  First known appearance of Morpheus, the Sandman.  Morpheus has many different names, since every culture has known of him in some form. Morpheus is fairly rarely referred to directly as the Sandman, with the major exception being issue #3.  In this shot, he is wearing a helmet; that is not his head.  Page 8-9:  We clearly see here the removal of the helmet, ruby, and pouch of sand, whose recovery will occupy most of _More than Rubies_.  Page 10 panel 1:  Ellie is holding a copy of _Through the Looking Glass_, and her appearance bears some resemblence to Alice, the heroine of that book.  Page 11 panel 2:  The word "morphine" is derived from the name "Morpheus".  Page 14 panel 3-4:  "Sleepy sickness" appears to have been a real phenomenon in the early part of this century.  It can also be seen in the Williams-De Niro movie _Awakenings_ and various texts.  Page 15 panel 4:  Who or what are the Endless?  They include Death, Destiny, Desire, and Dream.  We will find out more in later issues.

      (Please note that this post was composed on May 15, 2004)  Aah, there's nothing like working a nice, peaceful Saturday morning. At least until the sunshine hits and you're swamped with bleary-eyed toddlers looking for their next sugar fix. That's the sad reality of working at a convenience store; you're the worst paid drug dealer in the world. If you think that description's hyperbole, try selling cigarettes to an old man who's hacked out his left lung on the way to the counter. It's not just the tobacco either; practically everything here's designed to satisfy a damn craving. But in the big scheme of things, that's neither here or there. Whenever I get too many customers and I'm in a pissy mood I'll blame my grumpiness on the chemical dependence of society instead of my own anti-social dickhead tendencies to make myself feel better.   Went to see Troy last night with my ol' pal, Dane. Talk about one unsatisfying movie. First of all, practically everyone knows that Troy loses the war and Achilles dies (if you think this is a spoiler, go read a damn book). So much of the dramatic tension is pretty much lost. However, this isn't a big deal if you like the characters, and wanna follow them throughout their journey. The problem is that in a cast that's this big there's only two people I gave a damn about, Hector and Oddyseus. But this movie from the get-go is pretty much all about Achilles. Oh, Achilles... I hated, hated, hated, HATED that fucker. I still hated him, even after his character started developing in the last ten minutes of the movie. I see enough arrogant, cocky pricks in my day-to-day routine; I don't need to see one glorified on the big screen for two and a half hours. Another thing to point out are the natures of the opposing sides. The Greeks are portrayed as assholes and the Trojans are portrayed as sympathetic. Which is kinda annoying considering how it all turns out. Again, this would not be a big problem if there was the sense the Trojans were capable of more than dying in combat. Oh sure, they pull a couple of upsets  out of their asses. But the feeling you get watching this movie is akin to watching a bunch of tyrannosaurs chasing a lamb. I might be a bit harsh, but we're talking about an adaptation of the first (and possibly best) epic story that mankind ever produced. Homer wrote it to light a fire in mankind's soul. Of course, I acknowledge that a straight adaptation would be pretty much impossible. But in bringing this story to the big screen they cut out just about everything that made this story stirring in the first place.  Buuuuut... if you're looking for swordfights and naked men, you ain't gonna do much better this summer. And maybe that's the point.

      (Please note that this post was composed on May 16, 2004)  When you go to Rob and Lynn's house, there are two things you can expect: dogs and marijuana. Both of them were there in spades when I visited last night. 'Twas cool though; I love dogs and I don't mind marijuana, so a good time was had, I can say. I got to visit my delirious Mr. Show fandom on people other than my mother for a change; to the tune of seven episodes in a row. I still can't believe I got away with it, either. At the end of the fifth one Rob said, "All right, who's had enough of Bob and David?" But through the use of some divine mystical force that I cannot yet name or even understand, I managed to squeeze in two more episodes before I went to the bathroom and they hijacked the remote. Whatever the hell they put on next is lost in a gigantic haze; I just remember there were lots of cars crashing, a gratuitous lingerie shot, and a fat asshole pretending to be a badass. Oh yeah, Swordfish. Anyways, I think they liked Mr. Show until I overkilled it. But yes, the revolution is coming. Soon, the nation will be just as zealous as me. The Bob will rule all!  "Only British people can fly! You shouldn't try to fly, and you shouldn't listen to British people." - Our Excitable Friend from Across the Ocean, Ernie!  Dane and his girlfriend were there as well. That day was actually the first time that I met her. Now, before I continue on this topic I just need to point something out. Ever since my male friends went through puberty (I'm still waiting, apparently) they have attracted members of the female species. I say they have 'attracted' because I don't think any of my male friends have had to do more than a token gesture to get into a relationship, because the girl was already smitten with them. That's not the point I'm trying to make, but it's interesting to note nonetheless. Anyways, they would get girlfriends and I would eventually have to meet them at one point or another. There has been a startling consistency in their response to me to this point in my life, and I guess the nicest way to dress this up would be to call it toleration. Disdain would probably be a more accurate word, though. There are exceptions to this rule, of course, including if I knew the girl before they started going out or my friend and I first meet the girl at the same time. If I meet her for the first time after they've started going out however, it all goes to crap.   Now, after having established this disturbing precedent, can you imagine the meeting that took place going any better? No, I dare say it did not. In the first five seconds, which people say are the most important in first impressions, I could hear any hope of social chemistry between us splutter and die like a bloated muskrat. Which is a shame, because Fermita (dammit, I mean Femira, I think, sp?) seems like a genuinely nice person, despite that whole "If I could immolate you with my mind, I would" vibe going on. And hell, Dane likes her, and he's always demonstrated good taste.   Of course, one could construe through what I've written that it's entirely the girl's fault for this sad, sad game. After all, I'm an affable, charming enough lad; how could anyone dislike me? Heh, fuck that. If anything, it's my own fault entirely for this state of affairs. People who've known me for a long time know that I'm a rather shy person. However, I am not one of those affably shy people. You know, people who don't say that much but are still approachable. I am a MISERABLY shy person. It's the kind that often gets confused with being a snob. I have to admit it, when I'm in my shell I just don't look like that friendly of a guy. I've stepped away from this sort of thing as I've gotten older, but there's still this one instance that sends me into a relapse every time. And, if you can't get what it is, you obviously haven't been paying attention. You see, it all started back when I was 14 and it seemed like all of my friends were hooking up. Not me, of course. I started resenting them for seeming to leaving me behind. And when it was coupled with own frustration in being (in my own mind) disdained by girls, it grew into something even more bitter and poisonous. It seemed wrong to direct this odd mix of meat, gristle, self-loathing and hatred at my own pals, so I chose the next target in line: their girlfriends. I've never been able to hide my negative feelings (positive ones, I with no problem hiding) so the reaction they have to me was probably influenced by my own demeanour. Hence, my own fault. It's weird that I've never managed to shake it off. Whenever I meet a friend's bird, my mind regresses back to its state of when I was 14 years old. The aforementioned meat and gristle blah blahbity blah. Now, this isn't to say that I automatically despise them right off the bat. No no no. Just the sensations I had back then start up again. See, isn't armchair psychology fun?  But perhaps this is all for the best. In the one case where I started to get along with one of my friend's girlfriend, they broke up like one week later. So, if you start going out with a pal of mine, whatever you do, don't start being nice to me because your relationship will go down the toilet soon after. But in the meantime, just remember you're insulting my buddy's impeccable taste if you start questioning why I'm hanging around.

      (Please note that this post was written on May 17, 2004)  One of the suppliers dropped in today, gave me a free bag of Planter's Peanut Butter Bites (think Reese cups, but swankier) and asked if the store would be willing to order a box. Of course, with such a bribe as that and being lusty with power myself I yelled out to the heavens, "Damn right we would!!!!" I've sampled one and I have to say they're decent, except for a peanut aftertaste that lingers long after it's welcome. So, in an uncharacteristic spirit of generosity, I've decided to offer them to my customers instead. Response has been excellent, but there are a few people who still hang on the notion that nothing can beat a Reese. Ah, the joy of branding at work. How people can be emotionally involved with a chocolate bar is beyond me, but hey, what can you do? Some people have accused me of doing this just to move the product. Well, of course, but I'm mostly doing it to bribe people into thinking I'm not a total asshole. I'll buy their love and devotion yet.   I've sold one bag as I write this. Go me! Go Joelie, it's your birthday, gonna drink some Pepsi like it's my birthday. Sellin' lots of chocolate like it's my birthday It ain't even October but it's still my birthday! You can find me in the store Selling cigs to underage crack whores Pimpin' out candy gets me love So come give me a hug   Ooh... sorry 'bout that. But aren't parodies of year old songs the best? Just wait until I start on John Mayer!   While we're on the topic of pop music, I was recently mocked by three of my friends for not recognizing a recent Britney Spears song. I just, I don't know, there's just so many things  WRONG  with that I don't know where to begin. One would figure that you know,  NOT  having any knowledge on something so stupid would be laudable. Here's a little experiment you can do: go to Google and search for "Calgary Sun health care" and "Calgary Sun Britney Spears". FYI, the Calgary Sun is one of the daily papers in the glorious province of Alberta. Notice a disparity in the numbers? The Britney Spears search turns up at least twice the amount of results. How is it that something as trivial as an over-sexed pop star gets twice as much press as something that has a bearing on our daily lives? Sweet Zombie Jesus, any sign of ignorance in respect to the vacuous tart should be applauded!  And this is coming from a guy who just did a parody of a 50 Cent song. Hello, hypocrisy, my old friend... but the sentiment remains strong and true. It's practically impossible to tune out the ramblings of pop culture. Lord knows how much useless trivia concerning it I have harbored in my brain. But maybe, just maybe, we can cease our infatuation with it, and start to to concentrate on issues that matter.   Now whattya think of that; Danewort, Saraband, and Jeroboam?*  * Names changed to protect the incontinent

      (Please note that this post was written on May 18, 2004)  People have always dreamed of time travel. Go back in time, and visit an old relative who's long since passed; or go forward, grab the lottery numbers and use 'em to fatten the ol' bank account. My daydreams, too, are occupied with the idle fantasies of warping time. However, it's not money or truth that I'm seeking. No, I'll be going back in time five years, when a certain individual walks into Rolf's Groceries on a mission. But this time, he's getting no further than the front door. As he enters, he notices Rolf asleep on the floor. Before he can wrap his head around this, there's a flash of Japanese steel, and in the next instant his right arm is gone. Before he can start wailing like a constipated banshee, five more flashes light up the store. I'm not going to describe the resulting mess. The remains of the guy are then fed into all eight tumblers of the slush machines making a fairly disgusting mixture which is then deposited into a chum bucket. The chum is transported to the ocean and fed to sharks. The sharks are electrocuted, then served to the guy's family. After which they get thrown into cages containing horny silverback gorillas jacked up with cocaine. And finally, not only will I have prevented a foul deed from occuring, I'll also have sent a message loud and clear to anybody else who has the same designs. Now, you may be asking, what the hell did this guy do that's so heinous, so despicable as to deserve treatment like this? Did he rob the store at gunpoint? Did he throw a temper tantrum and knock over a rack? Oh no, nothing as trivial as that. This person came into the store that fateful day and suggested to Rolf that he should serve hard ice cream. And thus, the tenth circle of hell was born, and populated solely by me.     On a happier, and more tasteful note, I ran into one of my old co-workers from the gas plant I wiled away my summers in over five years ago. He is the man with no name; Kevin McNutt. He was there with a bunch of kids, who I believe were in a youth group he's running. I only managed to talk with him for a little bit, as he had to make it back to the church and I was getting swamped with customers. I gleaned some odd information from him; it turns out he's the only pipefitter left at the plant. What the heck's going on? When I was working there, there were pipefitters practically crawling out of the supervisor's ass. Now they're down to one. I heard they did some reorganizing since I left, but this is ridiculous. Anyways. Now that I'm four years removed from the school-yard antics that colored my summers, I can safely say that Mr. McNutt was one of my favorite people to work with. Anyone who can put up with my continual screw-ups is a decent guy in my books. It's kinda sad to note however that I didn't really feel that way the time. Every time I was assigned fixing the louvers (think gigantic venetian blinds) with him I thought that I was missing out on all the action with the other summer stupids. Oh, how my heart would sing when we had to go to the warehouse! Basking in its golden light! If I really had control over time, however, I'd go back and tell myself to let it go. Right after a little stint of unspeakable violence, as mentioned before. Compared to some of the crap I had to do and some of the assholes I was paired up with, this was pure gold. So what if I wasn't where the action was? Oh well, hindsight 20/20 blah blahbity blah. But back to the man himself. It should be mentioned that I haven't met a man more religious than he. Normally, this would not be a good combination, me and him. Yet besides the odd mention that I should really go to one of his church picnics, there wasn't anything churchy being shoved down my throat. There WAS the dissection of the Jesus mini-series playing at the time, but I'd rather not go into that. What is interesting about him being religious is that from the stories he told me he was the craziest, partiest mother ever when he was younger. Cripes, my friend Glenroy was with us once and you should have heard the stories they were bandying about. They were so raunchy I swore I could see the paint peeling off the pipes around us. What were they about, you ask? Well, they did swear me to secrecy. I guess it's been five years and the statute of limitations has expired, but still, these stories would probably mark them out as evil bastards for the rest of their natural lives. Thus, I shall remain silent on the matter for this point on. Or until someone sends me fifty bucks. Then I'm going to give out every last piddling detail. But anyways, let's jump back to December 2000, which was during what I call my Bleak Period. After an almost staggering display of continual fucking-up I ended up at my Dad's. Which is when he relayed a message from Mr. McNutt (and a Mr. Kirstein, but we're not talking about him) wishing me a Merry Christmas. This might not seem like a big deal, but at this point in time I was pretty much a wreck. I had done a damn good job of alienating just about every friend I had. Somebody wishing a pathetic wretch like me a Merry Christmas managed to get to even my black, crusted heart.   So, anyways, if you can hear me out there Mr. McNutt;  SHINE ON, YOU CRAZY DIAMOND!!     "Just wait till tomorrow I guess that's what they all say Just before they fall apart"

      (Please note this post was written on May 19, 2004)  Wooo! It's Core-Mark day here at the old Rolf store; which means endless pricing of crap. Okay, I should take this oppurtunity to address why all the prices end in nine. I know a lot of you are just dying to hear this information. Oh, so maybe you aren't; who cares? You're still going to hear it anyway. And git yer damn pointer away from the close button!!! I'm giving you knowledge! Maaaaad science! I'm droppin' old-school philosophy on yo punk-ass!   Yeah... Um, sorry, the leprechaun in my head was Riverdancing again. Stupid leprechaun.  There are two reasons why all prices end in nine. The first one is the one most people are able figure out for themselves; namely that $1.99 looks better than $2.00. Or $59.99 looks better than $60.00. It's just one of those low-level mindfucks to make customers believe they're getting a better deal than they're really getting. Hell, I knew about this back when I was eight. The second reason isn't as obvious; and that's because it has to do with us heathen bastards behind the counter. Back when all the prices were nicely rounded off, the management noticed that us cashiers (venomous, back-stabbing curs of Satan that we are) were taking the money from clean transactions and pocketing it. By a clean transaction, I mean one that doesn't involve making change. So, somebody would come up with a one dollar item, give us the money, and then we'd conveniently forget to ring it into the till. The noble and pure-hearted managers were taken aback by the gravity of the sins we had commited, and took it upon themselves to bring us back to the straight and narrow. Thus, every price from that point on would end in nine, forcing us to make change on every transaction, which meant we would have to ring it into the till.   Verily, the kind and loving executives had won this battle in the War Against Shrinkage. Yep, that's what stores call their losses. Shrinkage. Takes on a whole new meaning after Seinfeld, right?  "So, how's it going, Bob?" "Oh man, you wouldn't believe the amount of shrinkage I've got!" "Tough break, Bob. I could go over your resources if you want." "Nah, I think I got a good handle on 'em." "Cool. Wanna fuck each other up the ass?" "All right!" Help me! The subtext has become the text!   Ahem. The boss gets a convenience store magazine every month with his orders from Core-Mark, and if he hasn't taken it home by the time I get there I usually give it a quick read-through. Although most of it is run-of-the-mill business crap (Improve Your Customer Service! Stock More Stuff! Maximize Your Profits!) every now and then you run across something interesting. This month there's a three page advertisement for du Maurier cigarettes. First of all, cigarette companies haven't been allowed to advertise in Canada since like 1860 so I was a bit taken aback by this. Second of all, du Maurier is pretty much the top-selling brand in the country and stores would stock it anyway, so what's the point? And third; well, I'll let the copy speak for itself.  "Some cigarette packaging may look alike but the smoking experience tells a different story. du Maurier delivers on exceptionally smooth and classic taste that your customers cannot find in any other brands of cigarettes. Here is why: du Maurier has always offered an exclusive combination of filters and tobacco brands. If it's not a du Maurier brand, it's not a du Maurier product and it's not du Maurier quality. IT IS that simple. Now YOU know the difference! Only the du Maurier name guarantees the du Maurier quality."  Which is funny, because I thought the du Maurier name guarantees trach rings, lung cancer, and general hacking death. Sheesh, I should forward this to Canada's anti-tobacco lobby, or Adbusters at least; they'd have a bloody field day with this shit. I WOULD do it, I should say, if I didn't smoke more than London's chimneys myself. I'll end my discussion on the magazine by saying it has probably the silliest example of corporate lingo I've ever heard. In one article it actually describes the act of buying a chocolate bar as an "eat occasion". An eat occasion?! What the hell? What's next, when they go to the can are they going to say they're "performing a urinary evacuation"?  Ooh, it seems like the Calgary Flames are going to the Stanley Cup finals. Since I'm not a fan I usually have a marginal interest at best in hockey, but it's hard not to get swept up in the boundless enthusiasm that's flying all over the place. Frankly, after the dark days the entire country had last summer, it's nice to see people excited for a change. Getting the Cup back in Canada, even if it's in Alberta (as the assholes say), will go a long way in improving our national mood. 'Cause if cynicism were monkeys, we'd need a hell of a lot of bananas right now.  On the homefront, things are stable. I gave my room a massive clean yesterday, so it's finally hospitable again, although my cat was kind of put off by the whole thing. But seeing as she's the damn reason why I had to sweep up anyway, what with the cat hair and all, I really didn't give a shit. I gave her a toss out the door and let the ducks have their fun with her. After that was done I started up a new game of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. Even though it's been said many times before, I must say it again. This is one of the best games ever made. If you believe that video games have to ability to evolve beyond a spectacular waste of time into something more akin to art, you owe it to yourself to buy this game. Show the gaming cartel that you want to see more games like this and that you've had enough with the derivative unplayable crap that's flooding the market. And pick up Beyond Good & Evil while you're at it. It's short, but it's most definitely sweet.  Joel's Non Sequitur of the Day:  Jeroboam: I've been collecting silver bullion lately. Joel: Yeah, so what? I've got a stuffed Batman doll hanging on my wall!

      (Please note that this post was written on May 20, 2004)  Good news, everyone! The Rob Mob is back in business. Or the Lynn.. uh... Flynn. Hell, let's just include them both and call it the Hart Mart, okay? ANYWAYS, the Hart Mart, as it henceforth shall be called, is now the number one seller of dreadlock... wax? in the Rocky Mountain House area and is willing to supply your every dreadlock need. Git dem natty dreads, mon! Irie! Okay, okay, i'll stop before I embarass myself further. But it's good to see Rob (and Lynn; don't forget Lynn, dammit) back in business. So, with their future in mind, I therefore declare this to be the Year of the Snow Cult. Well, on my page at least. Which will get the message out to my whopping ten unique visitors. All right, so it's an empty fucking gesture! What, are you doing anything better? WHO THE HELL ARE YOU TO JUDGE ME?!  ...  So, to help out all of you who are lost as to what this business is and who these people are, I present to you:    THE ACCOUNT OF THE SNOW CULT The Immaculate Conception    "Lo! Dost thou hear the wind? Dost thou feel the shiver it imparts down thy spine? All's Wintered Eve comes! Prepare thouself, for long months of agony. The chill hardens the very marrow of bones; the eyes and lips turn to cold stone. Alas, the world of man suffers not alone. For in the merciless nights, the beasts fare no better than men under winter's harsh gaze. Nature is robbed of her beauty; there is only an endless white sea to behold. All things who dwell in these afflicted lands suffer. Oh thou naked man, oh thou shivering beast; how I long to clasp thee to mine bosom in the passionate fire of mine embrace!"  -- Lord Quincy; 1420  "A wint'ry doom has befallen our lands since the dawn of time itself. It retreats from the power of spring's warmth only to conquer again at autumn's finish. But its tyranny will soon be at an end. For in the snowflakes I have divined the coming of a conquering army, destined to make the winters their own! These good and noble-hearted souls will glide upon the very snow itself, illuminating the path upon which humanity will march itself to freedom. I must make haste to the Norwegian mountains, where I am assured by my good friend Heinrich, who has assisted me thus far in my research, that I will discover the rest of the prophecy. It pains me to leave my beautiful wife behind, but Heinrich has insisted that he look after her while I'm gone, so I know that she will be well taken care of. At the stirring of the morn, it is off to Norway I go!"  -- Sir Adelbaird Quincy; 1745  (British crackpot found frozen to death. A Mr. and Mrs. Heinrich Stoller will arrive in a month's time to claim the body on behalf of the Queen.)* -- Norwegian Telegram; 1747    *Translated from original Norwegian  "A pox on the usurping Stollers! They are the malicious beasts who condemned my uncle to lifetimes of ridicule upon his death. And now mankind is not prepared to face down perhaps its greatest foe. I have continued my uncle's research, and discovered that this army is not here to save; rather, to enslave! Plucked from the very bosom of the traitorous pagan god, Ularr, they will wreak unthinkable havoc upon this world. Unholy terrors! Robbed of their very wit and will by a sacred sacrificial plant, they will erode the morality and decency which keeps our society together. The arrival of these perverted Lotus Eaters is not the worst to come, however. Soon afterwards, one will rise from their ranks who will unite them all under a common banner. This cult, this Snow Cult will then rule the Earth as they see fit. We are doomed, doomed I say, doomed to an eternal winter!"  -- H. P. Quincy; 1863  "Hey! You know what would be a good name for my snowboard brand? Snow Cult!"  -- Rob Hart; 1999  "And so, the child of man and Ularr revealed himself to humanity at the turn of the millennium. He began to spread his tidings of love, respect and peace, but was quickly brought to an end by his own personal Judas. All was not lost, however, for he had once discovered a maiden fair and introduced her to his ways. Through their combined strength and love he was resurrected once again to preach to the masses. He is long gone from this world, but his spirit still lingers to guide and teach us. Praise be to Ularr! Praise be to Rob! Praise be to Lynn! Now step forward for your ceremonial toke and dreadlock waxing. Then let's RIDE!"  -- Mass on October 18 at a Snocultian Temple; 2545   There! I hope that clears everything up. Now you know all there is to know about Rob and Lynn's business.   "Man, I have too much time on my hands."  -- Joel Nielsen; 2004   P.S. I am not a fanatic. Love, Joel.

      Oh, what a month it's been! I lost my old internet account to the technological ether, but I've managed to summon another one to do my bidding. Unfortunately, I sign back on here and find out they've revamped the whole bloody shebang! And because of this, I can't sign on to my old... uh... blog. Yeah, I know, blog is a widely accepted term, and millions of people have no problem tossing it around everyday, but it still seems pretty damn ridiculous to me. Blog. Sounds like my cat barfing. Well, now that I'm done disrespecting one of the revered cornerstones of online life, I'll continue by venting about this shitty service! My god, you'd think they treat their customers better than that! I pay good money... oh wait, no I don't. I'll be quiet now. Praise Blogger! Praise Blog*Spot! The champions of the free-loading ingrate!  If you're at all interested in reading my stilted ramblings from before, click  urlLink here.  It looks and reads like crap, frankly, which is why I've decided to start fresh with a new one instead of complaining to customer service. The plethora of new design options just sweetened the deal. I've been creating posts during the last week, and I'll put them up shortly. But because of the way the posts'll be ordered, you probably knew that already.

      Phew. Although most people seem to be doing something extra fun lately that prevents them from sitting down in front of a computer and making a post, that's one problem I don't really have.  Updated the look on the Super Fun Happy Amazing Hour site. Nothing spiffy; updated the links and made a new logo to replace the boring old text one. Perhaps I'll do something for this page one day. Hmmm.  I shall be seeing Spider-Man 2 tonight. A review may follow. I don't see how it'd be really necessary, though; you either want to see it or you don't. No amount of rhetoric can change someone's mind when it comes to blockbuster movies.  And the day after? Well, it's Canada Day. I'm going to be working it, but that really should go without saying. Anyways, there's just one little something I want to tell all you revellers before you go out and down about fifteen beers; that simply isn't one of the better ways you can celebrate our nation's birthday. Now, I'm not saying that it's horrible and that you're an outright asshole for doing so. In fact, if I wasn't working that night there'd probably be a good chance I'd be joining in on the fun. I'm just tired of the fact that the source of most of our national pride is a beer commercial. I'd like to think there's more to being a Canadian than buying a flat of our namesake beer and shouting "I AM!"  Regardless, you should go out and have yourself a good time. Just remember to pour some on the curb for your poor homey working his ass off. Peace!

      Aaah, the weekend. A time of such wonderous wonderment. An ode of unimaginable beauty sang by the workaday masses now swathed in the golden light of freedom! Pastoral poetry leaping from the page into throbbing reality! A fire lit in the bosom of man and woman; who suffer little death and feel more alive than ever before! Orgiastic melodies climaxing in harmony with the Gods themselves!   At what point does subtext become text?  While bored out of my gourd Saturday evening I found a program that could quite possibly change your life. It'll make you new friends, and make your current friends worship the ground you walk on. Wo/men will throw themselves at your feet and beg to be your love slaves in pressurized lingerie. Governments will topple at your very whim. Well, actually, all it does is turn text to speech, but it's a fun diversion nonetheless. Just imagine, you can enter the text from this blog and it'll be exactly like I'm there reading it to you! Minus the smell, of course. Interested parties can click  urlLink here .   Joel's Conversation with a Customer   Customer: Election's on Monday. Joel: Yep. Who you thinking about voting for? Customer: Conservative. Martin ran a dirty campaign, I'm not voting for him. Joel: If that's your only reason, are you aware that are three other parties in our riding? And that you're not directly voting for a prime minister? Customer: ...uh... gimmee my cigarettes. [mumbling]  Why does it seem like the popular goal of politics now is keeping somebody horrible out of office instead of voting somebody worthwhile in?   The boss is currently telling his dog Riley in a screechy voice that if he doesn't start helping to put the stock away, he's going to have him put to sleep. When I told him that he sounded like the Wicked Witch of the West, he started cackling evilly and shouting "I'm wicked! Do you hear that Riley? I'm wicked!" Just one of the perks of working at the Rolf store: your boss is a complete looney. Actually, it's a good thing he showed up this morning because it helped to put me in a better mood; which is one of those rare instances when an employee is happy to see his boss. It's been rather interesting; I found out that the boss associates the NDP party with communism. When I pressed him to elaborate he told me to shut up and go back to work. So much for the dialectic. But really, it was a highly immature and relaxed morning. To start off the day I chased around Riley with my electric razor. We put empty cases of pop on our head. The boss referred to himself as a drunken monkey numerous times; parroting what I'd called him some time ago. The definite highlight - although to a mind that isn't on the brink it will seem rather odd - was a store announcement I made with the help of the aforementioned 2nd Speech Center. I won't bother transcribing it, but if you're interested you can obtain a copy  urlLink here . Suffice to say that when I played it over the stereo when customers were in the store I could  hear Rolf doubling over with laughter in the stock room.  The bizarre apex of the weekend came late Sunday evening, when a gigantic lady and her beleaguered teenage son came in for some slush. Upon entering the store she quietly commanded her son to not be an idiot, and they came up to the counter to get some cups. After paying for them she glanced behind the counter, then asked me if happened to be Rolf. I replied in the negative then pointed him out, as he was pricing something on top of the ice cream freezer nearby. She got his attention, and then in the most heartfelt manner possible said, "Thank you. THANK you for keeping your pornography magazines behind the counter and away from the prying eyes of children like my son." Rolf didn't know quite what to say to this, so he simply nodded his assent. At this point I was about to lose it. After they went to the machines I had to duck down and stifle my chuckles before they saw me. When they finally left I ran to the stock room and burst out laughing. Thank you? For that? What the fuck?! I don't know where to begin on this, so maybe it's best I don't start in the first place. Anyways, when the kid had filled his cup he had to ask what lid went with the smallest slush. Oh, I don't know; the smallest lid, maybe? You have to feel sorry for him, though. Let's see, he most likely has - or will have - mother issues impossible to fathom. It appears that there's an unimpenetrable aura of shame surrounding anything sexual in his household. Yep, looks like we got ourselves a serial killer in training here...  Attention all stoners: when you're reading our flavours of ice cream you will notice one named Heavenly Hash. The relevance this has to your daily life is apparent to anybody within ten feet of you; therefore you do NOT need to point this out. Thank you.   Two fifteen hour work days have taken a five dollar man and made change. I need a hug.

      I've started visiting political party websites. I can understand election coverage now. I read a summary of our town council's last meeting and had an opinion on each of the items besides "Meh." I watched CPAC for a span of two hours the other day and it's become my regular breakfast viewing material.  What the hell is happening to me?

      Nous étions tous en voyage quand un brouillard s'approche, C'est la forêt des regrets amers, des doutes sans rémission.  Anybody the least bit curious about my state of mind will receive an answer now, as I announce that over the next four days the shortest shift I'll be working is eleven hours long. Friday and Monday are noon to eleven gigs; this isn't bad because of the sheer amount of them I've been working lately. No, the insanity belongs solely to my weekend schedule. Believe me when I say that Saturday and Sunday are going to my clerking days' magnum opii. Eight to eleven both days. Fifteen. Hours. Of. Pure. Agonizing. Torture. Times. Two. Now, I realize that this isn't exactly legal; however, I have an entire flock(?) of screaming, rabid, and oversexed hyenas a.k.a. expenses writhing around on my back. Combined with my boss' propensity for falling on sharp objects and his lax attitude concerning the hiring of someone new, we couldn't give less of a shit. Boss gets to sleep, I get more money. Sure, the customers will have to deal with a twitching-bloodshot-eyed-foaming-at-the-mouth-butcher-knife-waving maniac come the later hours of the day, but since when has our store ever been about them?  Stupid, fat expenseses! We wants to wrings their filthy little necks! Now that I've popped a few more of your brain cells with yet another unnecessary Gollum affectation, I might as well outline what they are. First off, I need another pair of glasses. I'm not going to tell you how long I've had my current pair because it's very, very sad. Secondly, six months insurance at the end of July. Third, car payments! And lastly, it would behoove me to pay off the remaining debt on The Stolen Laptop so I can get transcripts from SAIT.   Moment of Zen:   One fine Friday many years ago, after my final class of the day, I decided I'd take a stroll down to the campus arcade. This was partly because I didn't feel like going back to residence to be harassed by my overzealous RAs. Nor did I feel like reading more rap lyrics written by my psychotic roommate that would always be posted on our door; most of them detailing how he was going to kill me and rip out my 'nosebone'. But mostly, it was because I wanted to make sure nobody had yet topped my insane high score for  urlLink Metal Slug . When I arrived at the Macewan Student Centre I saw one of the most pathetic sights that I've ever seen. Loitering around the front entrance were three fifteen-year-old  urlLink Whiteboyz  smoking cigarettes. Whenever a girl would enter or leave invariably a stream of catcalls from these three would follow after them. Any girl unlucky to get away fast enough would subjected to one of the boyz attempts to be suave. Since nothing about me is considered sexy to fifteen-year-old boys (or anybody else, for that matter) I entered the centre being subjected only to scowls. Does this happen anywhere else? Or was it due to the 'cone of ignorance' I seem to enact on my surroundings?

      Someone recently brought to my attention that a former classmate of mine is now running CJSR, the campus-community radio station of the University of Alberta. This is kind of depressing. Don't get me wrong - I couldn't be happier for her - but this news has forced me to evaluate my life once again and the findings, as always, have not been good. Goddamned quarter-life crisis at work. Rather than dwell on this however (although dwelling on it and making some change would be considered beneficial) I've decided to reflect on what the rest of my classmates have been doing since we collectively flew the coop back in 1997. It should go without saying but this will be a fairly self-indulgent post. Note to peoples mentioned: some light e-stalking has been done to find out just what the hell you've been up to lately. Rest assured that it was done solely for the purpose of research, and I'm not slathering myself in peanut butter and masturbating while viewing your pages. Although that last description probably did nothing to help rest your assures...  So in no particular order...    urlLink Dane L.   - He just graduated with a journalism degree.    urlLink Mike Sp.   - Going to school for carpentry.    urlLink Rob H.   - There is no description adequate enough for the kind of life he's led. Regardless, he's now working for his father's oilfield rental company.    urlLink Court A.   - In school for psychology degree.    urlLink Logan R.   - Instrumentation person in Drayton Valley.    Married to...      urlLink Diane T.   - Graduated from SAIT in Business Something-or-other.   Diane F.  - Last I heard she was set to graduate from SAIT's Radio-Televison program.   Teanna H.  - Went to Japan to do some teaching there, from what I recall.    urlLink Brad S.   - Currently playing for the San Jose Sharks.    urlLink Blake M.   - In the CFL draft, I think? Oh, he's been signed to the Stampeders.   Darla H.  - Elementary school teacher. Our store gave her entire class free slushies a few days ago. Go Rolf's!!!   Dustin M. a.k.a. Dirty Deeds  - Married, and now divorced. Works in a lumber yard? Used to work at Toys R' Us. Saw him a few weeks ago during my stint as Disoriented Man where we bitched about the entire female population of planet Earth.   Ames L.  - Is/was at the University of Alberta in an unknown program. I haven't seen him in a while, which is very lamentable.   Bill F.  - Probably something involved with rugby.    urlLink Ken H.   - UltraGenius now working at the University of Toronto, researching Computational Linguistics. Ninety percent sure it's the Ken I used to know.   Margaret L.  - Courtesy of that god-forsaken Classmates site: Hi, I spent way too much time in university, but finally came out with a BSc Ag... Want to read more of Margaret's Biography? Become a Gold member! Up yours, Classmates.   Nadine P.  - Another UltraGenius who I believe was working for the  urlLink Institute of Urban Ecology  in New Westminister, BC; but has since taken off for parts unknown.    urlLink Matt H.   - Architect? I don't know, that page is over three years old...   Robyn B.  - Journalist who used to work at the CBC. Maybe she still does; I just can't find any reference to her. Dammit, people, I'm the only one who's supposed to fall through the cracks here!   Colin S.  - Paints game controllers for a living. He's probably on to something else now, but because the last time I saw him he was acting quite the snarky asshole I don't really give a shit.    urlLink Loren O.   - Moved to Ontario and is now a member of the Army. If you went back in time and told 17-year-old Loren that he was going to join the Army, he'd probably punch you out.    urlLink Orlin G.   - He's in Vancouver and he's a chef at a very fancy restaurant.   Eric W.  - After a lot of post-secondary bumbling - although nowhere near the level of mine - he's now married and is currently working at Oras Communications.  So, there you have it. If you were in my class and you're not on the list, it's not because I hate you; it's because I forgot about you. Love, Joel.

      Get the tissues ready, because this is going to be a sad one. Not sad in the sense that it really sucks (I hope) but sad in the sense of bawling uncontrollably and digging your way through half a carton of cookie dough ice cream. So get that Prozac prescription ready, 'cause here we go...   ...and here we stop. First, I think some background might be necessary. I used to live in the beautiful (heh) town of Rocky Mountain House, renting a place with a congenial couple and their demonic kids. However, Rocky is an oil town, and since there's a ton of workers each earning an ungodly amount of money, rent is at the stratospheric level. It's definitely too high for a counter monkey such as myself to pay half the rent on a house, which was my arrangement at the time. So, I moved half an hour out of town to live in my mother's trailer. All bills were paid for; the only thing to consider was spending a lot more on gas. Until my car died necessitating me buying a new one, but that's a whole other story. Anyway, my mother is quite the animal nut. When I moved in there were five cats and an old dog named Ben (Extraneous detail: Ben is currently lying beside my chair at work. The boss is very liberal about animals in the store. Clean freaks and hypochondriacs can go to hell, because I'm not going to stop bringing him with me.) A new cat came shortly after, who I quickly adopted as my own and affectionately dubbed Squeaker. Now, you may be thinking that owning six cats and a dog is going far beyond the rational limit of pet ownership, and you would be right. Just try telling my mother that. The next couple of months saw the addition of three rabbits (Babbit, Swee' Pea and Flopsy) two chickens (Esther and Flo), and a fish (Bruce) to our menagerie. This, although rather strange, was manageable. The rabbits were cute (except when horny, which is ALL THE FRICKIN' TIME), the chickens laid eggs thereby serving a useful purpose, and if you can't ignore a fish then you have serious problems. But I have yet to talk about THEM; the vicious bastard Hell beasts plucked from the traitorous bosom of Satan himself. I'm talking about DUCKS. From what you've seen in various forms of media you would get the idea that ducks are cute and cuddly bundles of sweetness and joy. That is very, extremely, almost impossibly wrong. Ducks are raging assholes who seem to be capable only of incessant quacking and shitting. (Insert joke about some political figure here.) The drake in particular was a gigantic pain in the ass. Ten minutes after the chickens moved in he was screaming and smacking them around. He'd chase the cats and bowl them over, and one time I even caught him ramming into Ben. He loved the rabbits, though, even when they'd attempt to "love" him in return. We also had a female, but I never had any problems with her, besides the fact she was a duck. Well, there was the one time my mother came running in the door screaming, "Come quick and look! The ducks are having sex!" Ummm... right. Now that I've established some of the history, let's move on to the actual story, shall we?   The time? This past weekend. The place? Our trailer. My mother had gone away for a GMC seminar (a.k.a. getting drunk with car salesmen), and thus it was my duty to take care of our various critters. I came home rather late on Friday night and was surprised to see that there were no waterfowl on the front lawn. Usually they're out and about to harass me on the way to the door, but they were nowhere to be seen. I chalked it up to a tiring day of quacking and shitting, and went inside to go to sleep. Cue the next morning. I was woken up by a frenzied quack coming from underneath my bedroom window. By the time I made it there to see what the hell was going on, the perpetrator had waddled off. I went to the front door and saw the female duck going completely apeshit. She was running back and forth, flapping her wings and quacking herself to high heaven. Seeing as it was ten o' clock and the ducks are used to being fed at seven, I thought she was just hungry. I grabbed a carrot and sliced it up for her. It had no discernable effect on her demeanour, even though she'd gobble a slice between quacks. Then I realized I hadn't seen the drake yet. Usually, the two of them were inseperable. A frantic search around the property proved fruitless; he was gone. The female's quacks turned more and more anguished until she went to hide in her shed. With a sad sigh I hauled myself inside and got ready for work.   I arrived home late again on Saturday, and once more there were no ducks on the lawn. Not even the female. Instead of going inside right away, I figured I'd go on a little search for them. We rent a section on a farm, and since there are a couple of grain silos not far from the trailer I thought the best place to look would be there. I asked Ben if he'd like to come, but he decided to pass out in the middle of the driveway instead. Noofle, the most gregarious cat in the world, tagged along in his place. After making it down the hill (and carrying the poor confounded cat across the cattle guard) I couldn't see any activity at the silos. Further inspection revealed no ducks. Beaten, I began to trudge my way back. To my surprise Bailey, the fattest cat in the world, met us halfway. But a few minutes later he was already lagging pretty far behind. So, not wanting to see the poor bastard suffer a heart attack, I scooped him up in my arms and carried him the rest of the way. Points for effort, Bailey; points for effort. Noofle decided he wasn't going to be outdone, so he leapt up onto my shoulder and perched there like a bloody parrot. Just call me Dr. Fucking Doolittle.   Sunday morning was a let down as well. I couldn't see either of the ducks out and about. However, I decided I'd give it one last try before I went to work. I finally managed to find the female hiding behind a box in the duck/chicken shed. She gave some weak quacks when she saw me, then buried her head in her chest. I almost wanted to cry. On the drive into town I thought to myself that I couldn't just leave her like that; I'd have to go back and make sure she was okay. I gave the boss a call when I got to work, explained the situation to him, and asked if he'd be willing to work for me. He said that normally he would have no problem doing so, but he had severely injured himself (it's true; and it's NASTY) and could barely stand, let alone operate a till for seven hours on end. It was a let down, but I thanked him anyway. It was time to give my mother a call and explain the situation. After doing so and getting back to the hell which is my job I received a phone call back around four hours later. It turns out she was just sitting on some eggs that we had no idea she had. All in all, it's very bittersweet; we've lost our drake to god knows what but we're going to get some ducklings out of it. I just hope that duck appreciates that I was going to sacrifice seven hours worth of wages for her.   And now it's Monday evening. Still no sign of the jackass. At this point in time it's best to give up hope that he's still alive. And you know what? I actually miss the cranky asshole. I miss the way he'd charge at my heels, until I gave him a look and he took off in the other direction. I miss the way our amorous rabbits would follow him everywhere and would try to mount his neck. I miss the way he had no balance when he'd try to swim in the little pool we gave them; he'd teeter from one side to the other. And strangely, the thing I miss most of all is the bizarre harmony of quacking those two would have when you got them going.   Whew, that was depressing. What have we learned so far? Besides the fact that I'm a big pussy, I mean.

      Instead of the usual three sentence posts I've been fond of making lately I've decided to make one with a whole bunch of random ideas that would normally receive posts of their own. So now, you get a whole smorgasbord of Joel-y wisdom that'll brighten your day and you know, just improve your quality of life in general.  I love how the ads at the top of my blog change according to the crap I write. I typically get ads for psychics, which means even Blogspot thinks I'm a spoony bastard.  Somebody once came in the store wearing a shirt that says "You Don't Know It, But I'm Right In Front Of You!". It's a damn good thing I don't get high on the job because I'd be thinking about that for hours.    Best customer exchange ever:   Me: Would you like a bag, sir? Customer: No thank you. (points at wife) I've already got one.  A dad and son came in after a soccer game to buy slushes. As most fathers would be apt to do, this one was trying his best to offer his son some pointers on soccer technique. The one he emphasized the most was "Think Soccer!" Goddamn it, that's all you need to do?  urlLink Manchester United , here I come!  There is a printed warning on the back of Stewart's Root Beer, which says not to point the bottle at your face while you open it, lest you get a cap embedded in your skull. To be frank, this isn't even close to being one of the most  urlLink useless warning labels  ever made. But the fact that it exists, and considering all the  urlLink furor  over Big Fat and Big Sugar (the titanic corporate entity, not the band) it's only a matter of time before all packaged foodstuffs and beveragestuffs come with "WARNING: CONSUME AT YOUR OWN RISK" slapped on the front. Beware of food!  Speaking of Big Sugar (the Canadian band) I would like to suggest to the area's radio stations to STOP PLAYING THEM! I've heard that infernal "Don't Say It's Over" song so many times over my illustrious career as a counter monkey I've managed to create a dance routine for it. And yet, no one will ever see it. I have mixed feelings about this.  Although I'm loathe to say it, I urge all of you to rediscover the wonderful wonderfulness of strawberry ice cream. Just don't get it from my store, or I'll shatter your soul with my trademarked Vision-O-Rage. And for my vegan readers, may I suggest a nice tofutti?  Please read my early posts; I know my posts of late have had all the substance of a popcorn fart, but I actually put some time and effort into crafting the earlier ones. I'd hate to think it went to waste. Give my life meaning, damn you!  Fun fact: Dane has met Neil Diamond. I suggest you give him all the deference he's due from this. In contrast, the most famous person I've ever met was the lead singer of Canada's own  urlLink Zuckerbaby , which by a stunning coincidence is now defunct. Well, I didn't MEET him per se, he just happened to be working at the downtown HMV in Calgary while I was browsing for CDs. Upon us noticing each other, I looked at him with bewilderment and he looked at me with fear in his eyes. Then he went to price stock on the other side of the store. But that's the dark underbelly of  urlLink CanCon  for you: A guy gets tons of radio airplay and heavy rotation on Muchmusic, and he ends up fartin' around in an HMV between albums. Next up: the revelation that Tom Cochrane is disguised as the Deputy Prime Minister of Canada.  Delving further into the subject of Canadian music, I have an annoucement to make: I like  urlLink Bran Van 3000 . My level of like is so freakin' high it might better be classified as love. If Bran Van 3000 was a woman instead of a kick-ass musical collective, I would ask for her hand in marriage. Now, there will be three reactions to this news. Some of you will admit that they are, at the very least, decent. Some of you are asking what the hell a Bran Van 3000 is. And the rest of you aren't reading this anyway, because you're rolling around on the floor laughing. Now, lest you confuse my intentions, I am not "admitting" this. Listening to their music is not a guilty pleasure. It is not one of those so bad it's good things. I emphatically enjoy their music, and damn them that thinks that's sad and wrong. In fact, if you're thinking of deriding me for it, please note that I'm more than willing to go to Vancouver, Edmonton, Texas, or where the hell ever and kick your ass (or more realistically, get my ass kicked) for both my sake and the sake of a band that doesn't know that I exist. God help you if you even hint at the term "one hit wonder". But considering how small my readership is, the most that's probably going to happen is that  urlLink Dane  and I will get into a sissy slapfight.

      The boss came back from Red Deer with a truckload of stock today. During the conversation we had after he came in I referred to him as a drunken monkey, a pot-head, and a crappy dresser. I also made fun of his new  urlLink Swatch . Guess who's not getting a raise this year?

      I wrote this piece of... stuff three years ago, about a month after I broke up with my girlfriend. Hope that factoid puts it into perspective; I'm not that cynical and miserable of a bastard (right now, anyway.)  Two men were walking in the woods. One was short, sort of flabby, and had wild chestnut hair that clearly hadn't been washed in weeks. Thick old-fashioned glasses adorned his chubby face; so thick you could barely make out his sad eyes. The walk had taken much out of him. He was hunching over further with every step; gasping for more air with every breath. He was about to walk into a low hanging branch when his companion's strong hand roughly pulled him out of the way. The weak man looked up at him with gratitude. His companion was everything he was not. The glimmering eyes, the confident smirk, the muscular build; all of them gave an air of superiority the other man clearly lacked.        "Hey, watch where you're going, dude." said the confident man, condescendingly.    "Whoa, don't know what I was thinkin'. Thanks for going on this hike with me by the way."    "Think nothing of it. Adriana said it'd be good for you to get some fresh air. I'm always willing to help a friend."    "Thanks for spending time with her lately. Hopefully I'll get this stupid project done soon. I better get an A, so I can graduate with honors and that cool job at IBM. Then Adriana and I can afford to go someplace nice for our third anniversary."  The confident man gave a knowing smirk then increased his pace a little. The weak one struggled even harder to keep up.     "I can't seem to shake the idea that's she's seeing someone else. She's so disaffected lately. She wants more money, and whenever I come home she's off to somewhere else. I barely see her enough as it is. It's like she doesn't care about me at all anymore. Like she's giving all of her love to someone else."  The confident man stopped walking.     "Maybe it's because you're a pathetic loser."  The weak one stopped in his tracks a few feet ahead of the other man.  "Look at yourself. You have nothing to offer her anymore. Tell me the truth. There is no project to finish. You got kicked out one month ago." continued the confident man.  The weak man turned around, shocked and confused.  "No! I'm still in the course; h-how could you even say that?" he stammered. "I said tell me the truth. You've been going out drinking everyday, blowing your savings at the pub." "Th-that's a lie!" "Well, right now it is. But that's not what it will say in your suicide note."  Silence.  "I know people at the registrar," he continued. "We can erase you from the program from one month ago. Say there was a mix-up and a lack of communication to your professors." "W-we... why?"  The confident man pulled out a smoke and lit it. After taking a big drag, he continued.  "You said it yourself. I think my wife's cheating on me! Oh no! She is, you moron. She's cheating on you with me." "You?" "You have nothing to offer but hopes and dreams. You're a waste of a penis in the sack. You look like a bag of potatoes. Do I need to continue?"  Silence.  "Your marriage is one big lie. You've known all along, haven't you? You just never wanted to admit it to yourself. I'm sorry, ol' chum, but it's for the best. Adriana's a beautiful, vibrant woman and she needs a man, not some worthless little boy." "But why kill me..." squeaked the weak man softly, tears streaming down his cheeks. "The strong kill the weak. Survival of the fittest. You need to die. So you'll never try to claim another woman's heart that belongs in the hands of someone like me. Trust me, it's for your benefit. Do you honestly need to live through this pain anyway?"  The weak man shook his head. Calmly, the confident man reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a vial.  "Cyanide. This'll kill you instantly. If you don't want to go that route; well, we've got something far worse lined up for you."  With that the confident man flicked his spent cigarette at the other's head. The other man reared his head in pain as the cherry burst in a shower of sparks. He held out his hand for the cyanide, clutching his face in agony with the other.  "That's a good boy. You realized you won't win. All it took was some prodding from us. It might even feel good now, knowing the truth. At least you won't snap from living a lie morning, noon, til night. Goodbye. You were a worthless fucking waste in life, and so it shall pass in death. Now fucking take this before I kill you myself."  Without any shred of life, hope, or energy in his movements, the weak man opened the vial, dumped the contents down his throat, and closed his eyes.    So how was that for ya? Don't let a depressed man read Nietzsche, that's what I always say. Otherwise you end up with stuff like this.

      It just dawned on me that I've heard that overused "What's the number for 911?!" gag so many times that when the day comes that I need to use the service myself, I'm going to shout it out in reflex. I've heard it on the Simpsons, in the movie Idle Hands, and I'm pretty sure it's been the punchline in a blonde / redneck / Polish / insert unrespected group name here joke. It's one of those timeworn comedy clich&eacute;s, like fat people farting or... dammit, can't think of another one. But still, let the madness stop, please? If you're writing something that has a moron calling for help, don't feel the need to include the old workhorse. Have him call 912, which is the unwed rapper suicide hotline instead.   If you can tell me what I'm referencing there, I'll fly down to where you live and personally peel and feed you grapes. Women only, please. No fatties.

      From the mind that brought you this pointless piece of shit website comes another one with the sole purpose of taking up valuable space. This one is bit different, because it's supposed to be a partnership with my friend Dane. I say a supposed partnership because he's involved in all things wanton at the current moment, and has yet to make a post. So, you can check out the two graphic intensive scribbles I've tossed up there for the time being.  Prepare to be amazed, or  urlLink something .

      I'm inside a hallway. There is no light; but in spite of this I can still make out my surrounding. The walls are worn steel; cold, dull, and lifeless. Formless except for the division between plates. Cold misty air swirls around me, making my skin clammy. Claustrophobia lives here. Death is its roommate. I run down the corridor, hoping to find some way to escape. I run for what seems like hours, but my exertion takes its toll mentally, not physically. Can I make to the end? Is there even an end? Should I stop and accept that I'm trapped? My mind is a washing machine; these questions are its load. But eventually I reach the end. There is a thick metal door, braced against any attempts to be forced open. However, a thin stream of light shimmers from the hinges. Finally, I've made it! The only thing left is to open the door. I reach and turn the knob, but it won't budge. And when I look closer, I find a keyhole. It's in the shape of a heart.  'Nuff said.

      Heh. Even though I tend to bitch about my youngest customers the most, sometimes they can be pretty cool. Case in point; two girls came in the store with a bunch of change to buy candy. This sort of thing I find annoying, but at least they had the good sense to roll it first instead of dumping six tons of pennies and nickels on the counter. Anyways, they bought slushes and polished off the rest of their change with those ten cent rocket lollipops. While I was counting how many they bought one of them started cackling evilly. I gave her a bewildered look, and then she stiffened right up and said "I'm sorry, I'm experiencing technical difficulties at this moment." I think that's the first time a customer's ever made me laugh out loud beyond a bemused chuckle. Besides last week when the guy tripped over the cotton candy stand. It wasn't so much the accident as his reaction to it. It was the most hilarious "DAMMIT!" I've ever heard; the perfect mix of desperation and anger. So, it turns out customers can be pretty cool people sometimes. Who knew?

      Ah, the joy of dreaming. What happens when a person dreams? Is it opening your mind to an entirely new realm of infinite possibilities? Is it your mind giving you hints on what you need to do to make your life better? Or is it simply a section of the brain called the pons firing off randomly, leaving your cognitive faculties to make sense of the whole mess? Who knows? The only universally accepted theory on dreams is that people who force descriptions of theirs on other people are boring assholes. So, it shouldn't really come as a surprise that I'd eventually talk about mine. Hey, it had to happen sooner or later, so stop your complaining.   I've never been able to describe my dreams. Just about every dream that I can remember is so random and haphazard they defy easy summary. It's like something really crazy and interesting will happen, then BOOM! for some reason I'm working at Rolf's. Then I'll be chased by some big guy. After which I'm searching for a bathroom. There's really no narrative arc to help along in the description. If you weren't "there", then it seems like a big jumble. It makes sense in my head at the time, of course, but it's impossible to glean anything besides really basic moments to share in the waking world.  I don't know, it seems like when everybody else talks about their dreams they have a story to describe. I rarely have those. My dreams are a series of non sequitors. Just for the sake of example: Lynn and I got into a bottle fight, which stopped only because I almost skewered her pet rat, Michelle, with a piece of broken glass. At which point Rob had to drag her away, kicking and screaming, because she was threatening to destroy me. I can't remember what happened next, but let me assure you it had nothing to do with the previous scene. Probably climbing Big Rock Candy Mountain. While being chased by vampire puppies. Who shoot lasers from their eyes.  But on a happier note, I don't have nightmares, at least not in the typical sense.  Besides one I had a few months ago, anyways. Let me tell you, I saw imagery so hellish and terrifying it would put  urlLink Bosch  to shame. If I had the ability to translate it into an artistic medium I'd probably get the front page of  urlLink Fangoria . But anyways, the "nightmares" I typically get are so similar to  urlLink Curb Your Enthusiasm  I expect to get sued by Larry David any minute now. The basic recipe? Take one jackass (me), take a series of extremely uncomfortable situations, toss, spin, serve. And make sure it ALWAYS devolves into a screaming match between me and a dream character. Yeesh. An example? Well, a few nights ago I dreamt I was at work. Yeah, I know, I know, you sell your life for minimum wage but they get your dreams for free, yadda yadda yadda. If you don't know you're dreaming you can't hijack the narrative, eh? Anyways, it was three in the morning. The store was closed. Rolf was there, putting away a bunch of stock. Next thing I know, there's people coming in the door because we forgot to lock it. I informed Rolf that I wasn't going to serve these customers, so if he wanted to keep them in the store he would have to help them himself; you know, it being four hours since I punched out and all. He readily agreed, but after a minute an older couple came in and wanted ice cream. Rolf conveniently remembered something he needed to do in the back, so he asked if I would pinch hit for him. Being the wuss that I am, I agreed. And the order? Well, it was for 20 FREAKIN' BOWLS of Cookies n' Cream ice cream, along with a scoop of um... ahem... French Fry ice cream. I tackled the French Fry ice cream first, because I knew it was going to be a pain in the ass. And of course, it was. After managing to mold a decent scoop and getting it to sit in the cone, I looked to the side and saw Rolf sitting in the back and having a cigarette.   Well, I lost it.  I snapped.  I threw the ice cream at the wall, stomped to the counter and launched into a brutal tirade about abusing the good-will of a store by asking them to make twenty bowls of ice cream after they've closed. Now, if you ever scream angrily at someone in the waking world, they will either a) pound the crap out of you, b) run away, or c) try to calm you down. Rarely does option d) scream back come into play. But this being a dream and all, the old couple were more than happy to join in. The ensuing screaming match cleared everybody out of the story rather quickly; I think I even saw Rolf dash out the front door. But I must admit, the memory of being called a fucking asshole by a seventy year old man is something I'll always hold dear to my heart. The fact it only happened in my mind doesn't diminish it in the slightest. Now isn't that just a perfect dream? Though to achieve the full Curb Your Enthusiasm effect I'd need help later on only to find out that the old couple were the only ones who could provide it. Well, that's my subconscious picture show for you. Maybe one day I'll tell you about the time I almost decapitated someone who tried to steal my car.  It seems I might have rage issues.

      "Did you do this? All of this?" "All of what?" "The Vatican. U-Utah. Did you do that?" "Yes." "W-why?" "You came here to ask me why?" "No, I came here... to ask you... to put it back." "Why?" "Because you're not God." "Are you sure?"  Ever wondered what would happen if Superman became unhinged? We're talking about a being of immense power here. He's the superhero every other superhero is judged by. His awesome abilities are normally held in check by a strong sense of justice and the desire to do what's right. But if he ever lost that, if he ever started to do whatever the hell he wanted, if he went insane, then that would be the end. And it wouldn't just be the end of man, but the end of our planet as well. This idea is finally explored in Powers, which you'll remember me gassing on about in an earlier post. Of course, it isn't really Superman taking centre stage here; just a character who's pretty much the same as him. Imagine somebody with the power to follow through with what I quote next, and tell me that doesn't send a shiver down your spine.  "I tried so hard to be there for you. To serve you. I tried so hard to make sense of you and what you needed from me. I wanted to be there. I wanted to serve. But then it occured to me -- I asked myself the incredibly obvious question: why am I so much more than you? Why are you so small, and I am so much more? I then realized that I am not your servant. I am your king. I am not yours. You... are mine. To do with what I please. I bring you life. I bring you death. I control everything around you, and everything inside you. But you choose to life in such shocking contradiction. You fight over sand... You dress as God's servants and rape children. You dress as heroes and you pervert. I'm sick of it. You anger me. You confuse me. And I will have no more of it. No more. You cannot be trusted to decide for yourselves. I have control over your life. I have control over your existence. I always have. You will live the way I want you to live. You will be the way I want you to be. And I will bathe in the blood of those who dare to contradict me."  Going, going, gone... and the writer and artist team of Bendis and Oeming have knocked it out of the park! And the crowd (of ten drooling stinky nerds with  urlLink Asperger's Syndrome ) goes wild!

      I've been going over my old posts and it seems like every one of them has at least a line or two about my job. Now, it's true that a convenience store clerk will tell everyone he/she meets all about his/her job, especially what bugs him/her about it. In fact, it seems like it's all he/she can ever talk about. Is it being conceited, or a desperate cry for help? Well, in this case, it's because I tend to compose most of my posts on the job. Any gripe I've got with customers or the like will be fresh on my mind as I'm typing, so that'll be what I write about. It's not because working at the Rolf store is my entire life. Sigh, precious delusion, my old friend...  I'm listening to Depeche Mode's Violator right now, and it's dragging an amusing anecdote up from my subconsciousness. And lucky for you, I'm gonna tell you all about it. Rolf (who is obviously my boss) and I had a discussion about music a good while ago. After I'd introduced him to the soulful strains of  urlLink Atari Teenage Riot  (not a pleasant reaction, but not as shocked as I hoped) I asked him what kind of music he listened to. He replied by saying that since I was so young (Pfff!) I'd probably have never heard of any of his favorite bands. Those who know me know that my knowledge of music pre-2003 is nothing to trifle with, but since the boss had no idea I decided to have a little fun. I played dumb and asked him to try me anyway. First band he listed was Pet Shop Boys, which I answered by doing a goofy song and dance of their cover of "Go West". Next one he said was New Order, but I threw it back in his face by asking if he knew what band New Order had evolved from and the reason why. The answer to that, of course, is Joy Division, and New Order was formed after the lead singer of that band committed suicide. I then proceeded to go for the overkill by describing the scene they came from (or at least what I had gleaned from the  urlLink 24 Hour Party People  reviews.) Finally, he asked me if I knew about Depeche Mode. This is an insulting question on any level, but what made it worse is that I had played their Violater album no less than three times that night while he was working around the store! Sigh... well, we both learned something that night, at any rate. I learned that the boss has an almost insane infatuation with eighties music, and Rolf learned that I was an even bigger dork than he thought.  Oh yeah, around a year and a half ago the boss came back from Red Deer with a truckload of stock. He came in the store and begged me to put on the CD he had just bought. You wanna know what it was? Eiffel 65. Eeek. What's even worse that it wasn't the album with Blue on it; it was their brand new one. Double Eeek. Let your nightmares commence.

        It's raining, it's porny The old man is horny...    Hoo doggy, is it ever pouring out today! It started last night, just after the Flames fucked up Game 6 and it's not supposed to peter out until tomorrow afternoon. And while the population of Rocky weeps, the leprechaun in my head is doing backflips to disco music. Yeah, I've spelled out my general "frustration" with summertime before, so it should be obvious that anything that cuts a swath through the hot and sticky is fine by me. After all, it's easy to beat the heat when there's no heat to beat. Ain't it sweet? Another bonus is how quiet the store gets. It's a double-edged sword, though; as soon as the storm's over there's a rebound rush of people three times bigger than a normal rush. So, if it manages to keep up like this until after closing time, it'll be an awesome night. But as I type this, the rain just stopped. Fuck.   Er, when the clouds are close to the ground and swirling around in a circle, is that a bad thing? It reminds me of that time when my friend Jermey and I were on the run from this massive F5 tornado and had to tie ourselves to a pipe with my belt so we wouldn't get flung from here to Oz. Oh, wait, that was Twister. I guess that would explain why Jermey had a nice rack and looked like Helen Hunt.  Without anything better to do (besides, you know, doing my job) I've thrown myself headlong into  urlLink Powers,  the comic series by Brian Michael Bendis and some Oeming chap. I know I should perhaps be brushing up on my Plato, which I said I was going to do during my little breaks at work instead of reading comics. Philosophy is a much nobler pursuit, is it not? Plus, you can have something more akin to a normal conservation about it compared with comics. Although, I should admit, not by much. Comics and philosophy are the same in one matter, in that you can't just drop them into casual conversation. Really, there isn't much that'll make an uncomfortable silence faster than broaching the subjects of "Free Will vs. Determinism" or "Who was a better Green Lantern; Kyle, John, or Hal?" At least with the people I know, although at least two of them would have something to say on the latter matter. Er, what was the point I was trying to make again? Anyways, it all comes down to this: Do I want my homoeroticism  urlLink explicit , or do I want it  urlLink implicit?  Seeing as a few of my customers have started to question my sexuality, to the point where they're asking me to my face if I pursue the love that dares not speak its name, I better turn away from the explicit stuff for the time being. Which reminds me of a time when I was lamenting to a friend that I couldn't attract a woman to save my life. His response? "Well, at least you're not gay!" Thanks, I think?  Anyways, I believe I was going to talk about Powers? Yes, I was, before I went all tangential on your asses. I must have ADD or something, I can't seem to keep on one topic for more than three seconds. Powers? Let's see. Two homicide detectives. Their job is to solve cases that involve "Powers", or to put it another way, that involve superheroes. It's a highly entertaining read; sort of like a gritty cop drama tossed into a blender with a copy of Watchmen. Some of the thematic elements I've already seen, but they've never been used quite like this before. Where else can you see immaculately dressed terrorists lob Molotov cocktails at superheroes in protest of the Powers' "domination" of society? Or a hero who's just about impervious to any form of attack literally fucking himself to death? Not in Hagar the Horrible, that's for damn sure. It's such a damn fine book I'm going to have to pick up the trades. Which means going into the comic shop in Red Deer. You know, I always thought Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons was simply a caricature. Until I met one at that store. [shudder] Here's a quick tip; if I think you're a loser, then there's something seriously wrong with you. Seek help.

      Found a really interesting post on Douglas Rushkoff's site; I figured I might as well share it with all three of you who regularly read this   blog. Frankly, this couldn't have been posted at a better time because I've been pondering the notion of "toxic" individuality myself lately. It's kismet, I tell you! I'm just going to add my own little addendum to what he says, though. Free to be me, what's the problem? Well, to me being free to be yourself amounts to little more than buying into a pre-packaged notion of what you can be. I find it troubling the amount of categories there are in culture today. This is and always will be, so any complaint about is a moot point, however. What I find lamentably sad is how many people are more than willing to toss themselves in one of these boxes, declare themselves "individuals", and make it a point to declare themselves at a level above every one in the same box. That's my opinion (uninformed, as always) for the day.      urlLink Follow the trail of ones and zeroes

      June's arrival has got me a bit bummed out. Why, you ask? Well, it's the time of year when that ghastly season known as summer starts to shake off the lint and stretch out its arms. Bah, I hate summer. Hate it, hate it, hate it. Oh, but it's so nice out! So nice and warm and bright and green... hah! HOT and STICKY. That's my view on summer. Now, I know that some of you love being miserable and sweaty, but that ain't me. Ah yes, but the girls in skimpy clothes... yes, that would be a benefit. However, the only people I ever see in a state of undress are hairy fat guys, so I miss out in that respect. So buzz off, summer, don't let the door hit you on the ass on the way out! Don't need ass-prints on my door.

      Hmmm... it's Saturday evening and I'm kinda stumped on what to do. Bozzys, one of Rocky's famous hot spots, is closing its doors after one final hurrah tonight. Should I go? Would I be doing a disservice to my many "fond" memories if I didn't? Could the disrepect demonstrated by not going be considered an act of treason against Rocky Mountain House? Well, if it was an issue of that, then Fuck No; I'd be staying home. Besides, Bozzys is merely in the midst of a change in ownership. It'll be re-opened as The Fish Bowl at a later date. No, the issue at hand is a lot different than civic pride or a lack therof. Tonight will be a big occasion. A big occasion means lots of people. Lots of people means lots of girls. That's good! But lots of people also means lots of guys, and lots of guys means lots of bullshit. That's bad. What it boils down to is a case of eye candy versus rampant cases of testosterone poisoning. It's a very complicated decision, as you can see.  And lest you think I'm some sex-crazed buffoon whose whole-hearted belief in the Law of Averages will lead him to harass every person within fifty feet that has a vagina, perhaps I should explain myself better. No more do I go to the clubs/bars to annoy women with my pathetic advances. Now... I Come To Watch. My approach is best summed up by the song I Like to Watch by Canada's own  urlLink Prozzak :   I like to watch  I like the way you bounce bounce  I like to watch  Ya ya groove 'n' move it  I like to watch  Shake it if you've got it lady  Here's my confession  I like to watch your hot box    Uh... except for that last line. I don't know what the fuck that's about. Hey, hold on a second. What are the benefits of insisting that I'm a staring, drooling pervert instead of a sex-crazed buffoon? Oh man, why do I keep painting myself into these corners?

      Sigh. Summer always seems to devolve into a rut once it hits August. The pleasure centre of our collective brain is suffering an overdose of sunshine, lollipops and rainbows. The people who were looking so forward to warm temperatures are lost in a zombie haze. The burst of energy that came in May is over; we're now coming down off our summer injection, and it's turned out to be one bad hit.   "Oh, look. The sun is shining again. Perhaps we should go outside." "Yes, I agree. Let's." "And we should also visit the beach. I suppose that's what people do on days like this." "Boy, I can hardly contain myself, the glee is just too much." "Hey, look at the water. There are kids and dogs in it. They are splashing about." "Huh. What a delightful picture." "What perfect weather for another barbeque." "More hamburgers? Yay."  And on and on and on. No wonder people are more energized when autumn comes. Just one big rut. Rut rut rut rut rut rut. Hey, isn't the English language swell? Apparently "rut" can mean "A settled and monotonous routine that is hard to escape" or "to be in a state of sexual excitement." This post just takes on a whole different meaning if you use the latter definition. A sensual meaning. Growl. Yay for the protean nature of the English language!  As you can see, my list of topics to post about has grown slim; rather slim, indeed.

      It was a dark and stormy night. The wind howled menacingly in the little town of Rocky Mountain House. Lightning flashed. Thunder crashed. On that fateful evening fourteen years ago, the rain... hold on a sec. What's that, brain? Oh. Turns out it was actually a balmy summer afternoon. Well, so much for the imagery, then! Stupid brain. Anyway, I wasn't outside frivolously frolicking about like children are supposed to do during the days of their summer vacation. No, I was inside playing The Adventures of Bayou Billy for the NES. This was an ambitious game for its time; combining brawling, driving, and shooting sections. It was really hard, and it really sucked. As can be expected, this suckage extended to the game's music, as well.  Digression:  To be fair, this wasn't something unique to this particular game back then. Horrible video game soundtracks were one of the hallmarks of the NES area, caused by a combination of poor technology and apathy on the part of the game developers. There were few exceptions to the Nintendo Audio Curse, and the situation didn't improve until the advent of the Super NES. That really made no difference to me, however; I was still stuck in the era of tinny booping and beeping.  It doesn't take long for a video game soundtrack to grate. I usually play other music to save my sanity. Back then, the tape of choice was MC Hammer, but that was beginning to grate as well. So what to do? I rifled through the household selection of tapes and chanced upon Highlights from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera. I remembered that my mother and her friends wouldn't stop gassing about it. Deciding that I should hear for myself what the fuss was all about, I popped it in the stereo. Apart from the interesting contrast that arose from listening to Prima Donna while pounding the crap out of digital villains, I wasn't that impressed. Little did I realize that fourteen years later I'd still be listening to it.  It came to pass that I salvaged the tape from the back of our storage closet a few years later, while I was looking for decent music to listen to while I played The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. I put it in the stereo of the swanky game room I had "convinced" my parents was necessary, and I don't think it left for another month. It turns out that being a bit older made me a lot more receptive to the joys of the musical. Much to my father's chagrin, I suppose; it must have been a bit disconcerting for an AC/DC lovin' hog ridin' man to find his son listening to a musical while playing a game that involved a little green elf.  Which begs the question: Did I ever see a performance of The Phantom of the Opera? Why yes, I did! However, apart from the business with the chandelier and the... um... "qualities" of the girl playing Christine, I don't remember too much about it. So I guess that leaves out any possibility of discussing it, then. On we move!  There is the begging of another question: Why the hell am I even bothering to write about The Phantom of the Opera? Well, it turns out the chaps in Hollywood are producing a movie version of the musical. Sound good? Hold your horses, young fella; Joel Schumacher is at the helm. That should give you a bit of a pause. The man has a history of working with great ideas yet dropping the ball. The perfect example of this - barring the obvious one - is Falling Down. A man suffers a stress-induced meltdown after dealing with too many of society's flaws then proceeds to toss aside the Unspoken Rules. This is an idea with great potential. So why does the movie devolve into him pulling a gun in a fast-food restaurant because he missed breakfast by five minutes? Given his past directorial efforts, I don't have high hopes for his take of The Phantom of the Opera.  But successful movie or no, at least I'll still have my tape, and the wistful nostalgia that goes with it. Memories... shit, wrong musical.

      As I sit and stare at the title I've just written, I'm starting to realize that I may just be out of my depth. After all, the blog outbreak has encompassed the entire world. I doubt there's one geographical location, obtuse ideology or obscure hobby left unrepresented. At the moment,  urlLink Technorati  lists over 3,265,509 blogs watched. Any minute now, I expect blogging to supplant porn as the number one Internet pastime. Blogging is built on self-reflection, and given the sheer number of online journals and such there have been countless number of posts discussing the Worthiness of the Blog. What can I add to this din that hasn't been said already? And a better question to ask is: Why should I bother? There's only one thing I can say to these admittedly apt questions: I blog, therefore I am.   Note: I don't understand it either, but it sounded good in my head, so it's staying.   Perhaps I'll begin with my own reasons for starting. I found my first online journal back in the balmy spring of 1999. After a brief period of bemusement (as in: Who the fuck wants to read this crap?) my mind changed to wanting to start one of own. However, I had an utter lack of knowledge concerning the logistics of web-publishing and a rather strong desire to not learn any of it. Fast-forward five years later, with my introduction to Blogger. Ah yes! Now you're playing with power! Thus, Our Names on a Marquee was born.   After making several posts, I started to reflect on my continued blogging career. Most bloggers do this after the initial thrill of having your random thoughts available to the masses is over. And while I was surfing one night, I came to the understanding that a lot of people don't think highly of the so-called self-publishing revolution. If you believed them, the web was soon going to be overrun by idiots who can barely work a keyboard. Quality content would be lost in a sea of meaningless information. Nothing less than the fate of humanity was on the line. But in spite of this invective, I resolved to contine my blogging efforts.   First of all, the web has always been a sea of meaningless information overrun by idiots. Take it from me, I've been here for ten years now. (Hey, wait a minute...) Considering the exponential growth of the Internet, the ratio of quality sites to pointless crap has never had a massive fluctuation for good or ill. Back in the day, we had pages devoted to people's cats. Now, we have blogs. It's not that a big of a difference, if you ask me. Number two, horrible blogs with no redeeming qualities aren't going to last. They'll soon be abandoned due to a lack of interest, personal or public. More digital detritus? Indubitably. But this is nothing new. Number three, and this is a bit more sticky. What about what the blogs are about? And I'll answer this with another question: Does it matter? There's millions of voices on the web right now. Some of them tackle politics. Some of them review the arts. Some of them talk about their love lives. Some of them discuss what brand of toothpaste they use. The weaving together of these voices into an ungainly yet mesmerizing mosiac is one of the reasons I've enjoyed the Internet ever since I was first introduced to it. I'll admit that some of these pursuits are loftier than others. But I'll be damned if I ever say that the lesser should make way for the more.   And that's why - despite the waves of elitist pontification - I'm a-keeping my new blog.   Note: If you're interested in reading another opinion - one which is hella more fleshed-out than mine - you should read  urlLink this . He even has a section devoted to the classification of bloggers. In my continuing pursuit of greater forms of self-deprecation I've decided that I'm an Obsessive-Delusional Ranter. Which kind of blogger are you?

      OOH! A trip to Red Deer yesterday! I guess I'll have to come to grips with the fact that I'm a Consumeristical Bitch and that  urlLink Naomi Klein  et  urlLink al  are coming to molest me any minute now.&nbsp; On that note, is anybody else feeling a rather peculiar case of Left-Leaner's exhaustion lately? At this point, if I found out that George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld raped a bunch of monkeys&nbsp;then jizzed all over the Constitution, I'd hardly bat an eyebrow.  I can't believe I just wrote that.  Anyway, I spend a lot of money. What did I pick up? Why, I thought you'd never ask!  For books: Bastards and Boneheads, Fire and Ice on a recommendation left by H. W. in my comments section so H.W. I thank you, a history of the number zero, Wonder Boys although I was really looking for Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay but Wonder Boys was a great movie so I decided to&nbsp;get the book it's based on, Maus, and V for Vendetta.  For movies: Kids in the Hall Season 1, Glengarry Glen Ross, and Melvin Goes to Dinner. Melvin is by one of my heroes  urlLink Bob Odenkirk .  And I'm spent.

      Sorry to let you down, but I'm going to be taking a break from the site and the Internet in general for the next couple days. Perhaps, I might start enjoying life instead of constantly lamenting it.  I can hear the shattering of millions of hearts already.  And somewhere a baby is crying, because  urlLink The Dazzling Sports Ross  has decided to discontinue his blogging efforts. It'll be sad to see him go, as he was one of the first non-friends to post a comment here. Should I remove his link or not? Heh, we'll see.

      Carbonated caramel-coloured sugar water?   Check.   U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind - which would be perfect if not for the groan-inducing Beautiful Day - on the stereo?   Check.   Brain hijacked by evil, evil memories?   Check, check, and double check, with one more check for good measure.   I suppose, then, it's time to begin.   The possession of so public of a forum requires a decent amount of discretion on my part. There are a many number of things that I shouldn't post about; and number one with a bullet are the details of my personal life. The reasons for this are varied, but my favorite is also the one with the most common sense: nobody gives a rat's ass. So I ate a strawberry Pop Tart for breakfast this morning. Who cares? Is that knowledge going to empower some poor sap to take charge of his own life? Frankly, I doubt these "revelations" carry enough oomph to puncture a brain cell; beyond the blogger's core audience of friends and family, of course. And since a large section of my audience is imported from somebody else, I'm not sure that anything I have to say about the details of my own rather humdrum existence is going to intrigue anybody besides the terminally bored. But hesitatant introduction aside, I'm still going to go through with it. Prepare yourselves, people; I'm going to be talking about a subject which'll be rolling up your socks instead of knockin' em off. Relationships, of course. Specifically, mine. More specifically, one of them. And may God have mercy on us all.   It all began in the frosty Rocky Mountain House November of 2003. I was working one evening when a rather striking young woman came into the store to purchase some milk. She came up to the counter and we exchanged the normal customer/cashier pleasantries; the typical comments about the weather and somesuch. She was smiling at me the entire time, which I took to be rather odd, because hey, its me we're talking about here. After I gave her the change, she asked if I worked a lot. I replied that I was pretty much there every evening. She gave a coy smile and said, "Good. That means I'll be seeing more of you." My friends know that when I'm in a situation such as this my face turns beet-red and my mouth turns to my brain-signal-ignoring jelly. And of course, this time was no different. She must have thought it was cute, though, because she started chuckling as she waved good-bye.   I saw her a few more times through the end of November and the first half of December, which culminated in her asking me out to lunch. And so we went. During the course of my meal I found out a lot of things about her that would make a lot of normal guys salivate; such as her affinity for fast motorcycles and sky-diving, and the fact that back in her native Indonesia she was the lead singer in a pop-punk group. My side of the conversation was rather sparse, the only thing sparking interest in her being my then-recent conversion to vegetarianism (which has since ended.) After we had finished we then went to my place where we watched "Jackass: The Movie" on my computer. Never underestimate the romantic appeal of buffoonery, I guess. We made a date to hang out together New Year's Eve, which was the next week.   And so, it was December 31st. We renting xXx (goodbye, braincells) and settled in for a rather uneventful night of movie-watching at her house. Her family phoned after I had been there for an hour, leaving me to contend with her 3 year old son. His idea of a fun game was whacking me in the knee with a plastic hammer. I tried to play along for a bit, but I had to end it after he went to grab a REAL hammer. Oh, aren't kids grand??? The rest of the evening went smoothly, but I was struck with the notion that Something Wasn't Quite Right with the whole picture. After all, we have a single mom who just moved to Canada and has no job, yet she was somehow able to afford a swanky new house and a brand new SUV. I inquired into what job she had back in Indonesia to be able to afford all this, and she said she was in PR. Having no idea what the average flack makes, I left it at that.   2003 began. I was at her house almost every single night. We even took a trip to Red Deer together, where I was subjected to her singing in the vehicle. Please note: If you have a heavy Indonesian accent, it's not a good idea to sing Celine Dion. Ever. Don't. However, she was beginning to act strange. She would get wistful and intimate that she wanted nothing more but to run away with me, because she was in l... and then she would stop. I knew what she meant, and it sent chills down my spine. Not because I have a phobia of the l-word, mind you; but because 1.) I'd only known her for a couple of weeks and 2.) she knew absolutely nothing about me. I could describe every detail of her life story to anyone who cared to listen, but besides the facts that I worked in convenience store and I didn't meat, she knew zip. This was partially my doing, of course, because I've learned nothing ruins a relationship quite like me opening my big mouth. However, she didn't appear all that interested, anyway. The notion that Something Wasn't Quite Right swelled up once again.   It came to pass that one night I was able to get off work earlier than I expected. So I went home, and decided that I would phone her. I dialed her number and was surprised when a man answered the phone. I asked in a fairy nervous fashion if she was in, to which he grunted angrily and passed off the phone. When she answered I rather jauntily asked who that guy was. She rather nonchalantly replied that it was her husband. Oh. It turns out he was working in Russia the whole time, and every trace of his existence was cleverly erased from the household. She said she wouldn't be able to get in touch with me for about a week (for obvious reasons) and we'd get together later. Hoo boy. The pieces had come together. I don't think I ever talked to her again, but that wouldn't be the last I'd hear of her.   I was quite the babbling fool for the rest of the evening. I had visions of some fearsome fire-and-brimstone Relationship God slamming his palm on the earth and bellowing streams of invective at me. In an instant, any good relationship karma I had built up immediately evaporated. "The Other Man" by Sloan suddenly took on a deeper meaning. O Foul Temptress! Lead astray by your wickedness! These thoughts kept on until I was informed rather briskly by an acquaintance that I should suck it up and recognize that it was mostly my fault for sensing something wrong and doing fuck all about it. Quite true, I have to admit. Although in my defense my gut usually has shit-for-brains, and I take anything it tells me with a grain of salt. Eventually, the only thing I was really mad at was the fact I left my copy of The Royal Tenenbaums over at her house. What was I going to do, knock on the door and say, "Hey there! I'm the guy who turned you into a cuckold! Can I have my movie back please?"   And that's not the end of it. Yep, there's more. It came to pass that several months later my roommate spotted her driving past our house numerous times one day. I didn't end up getting stabbed, thank goodness; but her husband was rather shocked to come back home from Russia one day to find out that she had fled the country with their son.   True story.

      Oh, I've been meaning to get to this for close to a month now. I suppose now's a good a time as ever.  There once was a girl named Sara Tjostheim. She befriended some goofball named Joel Nielsen. And along with a whole other cast of crazies, they wiled away the summer months working in a gas plant. But those summer days have long since gone, and after a number of wacky mis-adventures she found herself working at Northern Cablevision in Grand Prairie covering the local entertainment scene. Since this was Grand Prairie and all, you can imagine that this wasn't a very fulfilling job. In a fit of frustration, she began harassing the local CFRN office to hire her. Now, when the average person such as you or I do something like this, we get a squad car full of psychotic police officers chasing after us and smashing off our private parts. But because this is a very special girl we're talking about here, they took pity on the sad case and hired her. So now, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to announce that starting Monday the Magnificent Sara will now be working at CFRN! Hey, wait a minute. Remembering Dane, I just realized that two of my friends are journalists. This is a scary trend and I'd like to see it stop immediately.  In other news, my friend Jermey has mowed his lawn. Go Jermey.

      Whoop, I'm watching a rebroadcast of the swearing-in ceremony for the new cabinet ministers. And they're now grouped together on the lawn for a picture, I believe. Oh, and the camera has zoomed in on Paul Martin. He's currently demonstrating all the facial gestures associated with taking a gigantic, soul-wrenching crap.  The symbolism of this should not be lost on anyone.

       urlLink A member  of the hack circle based in the University of Alberta recently left a comment asking why I was "stalking" Steve Smith. Because I didn't feel like writing anything at the moment, I cut and paste my explanation from an e-mail I sent to Mr. Smith detailing why. That much should be clear if you've been reading my comments section. What you probably don't know is that I made a list of alternate explanations to help break the ice. Frankly, I doubt it worked, but Steve Smith left a comment last night suggesting that I post them because he liked them better than the "straight" reply. At first, I was apprehensive. After all, there's a lot of you who think I'm some wacked-out creep, and reading these aren't going to help change that opinion. But should I be making futile attempts to change it, or should I be embracing it? Eh, who knows. At my best I'm a charlatan and at my worst I'm a goofball.

      'Tis with a mild sense of disappointment&nbsp;that I scrap the project that I was working on. For the time being, anyway; I'm sure there's another phoney milestone I can celebrate coming around the corner. What was it, you ask? Well, suffice to say it was another misguided attempt to bring you all to the verge of the laughter. Which is something I try so hard to do in my continued blogging.&nbsp;So I apologize to my regular readers - and there ARE actually a few of you, given my tracking statistics - you're just going to have to make do with the humdrum descriptions of my day-to-day life. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Notice to anybody who regularly reads this space: &nbsp; If you're wondering why I haven't updated for the past few days, it's because I'm working on a super peachy keen project. And it can't be entirely chalked up to procrastination, either. I'm waiting for SOMEBODY to get back in touch with me so I can get it finished. I should make that multiple somebodys actually, because there's more than one. So please guys, can you stop having wild monkey sex and/or injecting heroin into your eyeball for ten whole seconds and write me back? Thank you. &nbsp; Now, back to the old post... &nbsp; Oh, what a beautiful day! Yessiree, I don't mind the mugginess one bit! Full exposure to a burning star? Oh, no problem; no problem at all!   Fuck.    Adventures In Messaging    If you've been paying attention, you'll no doubt remember my announcement concerning my triumphant return to MSN Messenger. And some of you have even added me to your lists. Mwah! Anyway, in that post I mentioned that some Rocky kids decided to add me. Because of the deep wells of generosity i carry, I reciprocated. Last night, one of them messaged me asking who the hell I was. I told her, of course. She said she didn't remember adding me in the first place and insinuated I was a creepy pervert for adding her. I tried to state the case that I was simply reciprocating, but I guess no matter how you slice it, it looks pretty seamy for a 24 year old guy to add a seventeen year old girl to his list, reciprocation or not. So I ended the conversation before she could keep on the path of accusing me of being a deranged sex offender. How the hell do I keep ending up with that sterotype?   In another recent conversation, the person I was chatting with announced that they were "nominally diurnal" and it was time for them to hit the sack. And in the folly of my youth, I took it to mean they had two urethras. Which is typically something you don't admit in casual conversation. But, it turns out diurnal means "belonging to the day" and not some bizarre birth defect. Heh, don't say much for my vocabulary.

      So I'm down to using that as a title. That's not a very good sign.  I was watching CPAC last night, and they were having a discussion on the North American Relationship. As is typical it turned to the subject of the U.N. and whether or not Canada should side with it instead of the U.S. The fellow who was speaking, who I believe was from the Southern Methodist College in the States(!), brought up the point that the U.N. was LITERALLY where the world goes to discuss its problems. So... as opposed to figuratively? Goddamnit, I always thought that it was a complicated metaphor for baloney and cheese! Next time, Methodist; next time!  Who am I kidding? Who am I fooling? When they be like, "What's Up Joel?" And I say, "Cooling."  Oh, and then we had the guy who said unilateral around thirty times in the span of three seconds. What a foreign policy stud. Ariel Sharon probably has a picture of this dude up on her bedroom wall and coos lovingly at it every night before she goes to sleep. Hey, whattya mean, she's a guy? Well, I still hold to my speculation.  Hmmm... It appears I've received a message from the House for the Actualization of Canadian Knaves - or HACK - issuing a cease-and-desist order in respect to my "half-assed political commentary". Or else they're going to "send a slobbering Paul Wells to remove my testicles with a paring knife". Okay. Well, everything seems to be in order here... have a good night, folks!

      Useless Information: This will be the first post I've composed at home since... well, ever. So as you can imagine, it's a rather exciting time for me. Free from the constraints of my job, I can finally let loose and tell you everything that you've been dying to hear; that I've been dying to tell! So here we go. Now. I'm gonna start now. Maybe... now. Now? Screw it, I've got nothin'. Guess this is going to be the usual crap, then.  In a move that will no doubt shock long time readers, I finally took some time off recently; this past Thursday and Friday to be exact. Yep, I came into work on Thursday evening and I could barely stand straight. I was just too damn burnt out; I begged the boss to give me the night off before I passed out on the spot. Seeing the shape I was in he agreed, at which point I promptly woke up and went to visit a friend. Heh, five weeks straight. Half of them were at least eleven hours long. I don't know what possessed me to give up smoking at the tail end of a stretch like that; hell, if anything, I should be smoking more. But I'm not. Oh, I'm so conflicted...   Follow Me Go Shopping Eh, Me Go Shopping   Ah yesh, went on a shmall shopping shpree, I did. Sheeing ash there'sh nothing more intereshting than hearing shome ash-hole talking bout hish endeavoursh ash a conshumer, I shhall deshcribe them for you ash to masshage your brainsh. Imposhibbible!   First, a question for gamers: Don't the Hypello from Final Fantasy X(-2) kick ass? Ride zat shoopuf, baby!  DVDs! I picked up Bad(der) Santa, Catch-22, and the South Park Season 4 set. Now, before I continue, I'd just like to point out a discovery of mine. Rather informal this; just something I've noticed along the way. There seems to be an odd relationship between how quick-witted someone is and how much they like South Park. Really annoying and buffoonish persons hate it, while intelligent and enjoyable people like it. So, it's best to keep that in mind before you start sneering at my decision to purchase the set. Of course, it should also be pointed out that the most intelligent and enjoyable people don't care either way because they have the sense not to get emotionally involved with a television program. And for the most part, I must concur with that sentiment. But five words: Don't Fuck With Mr. Show.  I also picked up The Rundown previously viewed. This is probably not something I should admit on so public of a forum. Regardless, I have to say it does what any good movie should do. It delivers what it promises, and how. Nothing else I can think to say about it at the moment.  Well, I'm starting to peter out here, so I'll leave my thoughts on the Spider-Man 2 game for next time. Don't do anything an enraged pirate with a nasty case of crabs wouldn't do.

      In yet another pathetic bid for attention, I'm announcing that I am once again using MSN Messenger. So if you're looking for saucy and intriguing conversation... I'd suggest you keep looking. But if you're looking for rambling and incoherent converation punctuated by multiple swear words, then goddamit; I'm your man! But if you think I'm just going to write down my contact info, then you're missing the point. Actually, I don't think I get it either. Could somebody please tell me what the hell it is? Anyway, in the spirit of my continuing efforts to confound and vex you, dear readers, watch as I present my information in the form of a PICTURE!       Fun Fact: As I booted up the new version I'd downloaded, I found out that some of the local kids had added me to their contact lists using my dormant MSN profile. Heh. It turns out that when I found their site a month ago and signed the guestbook they decided they'd like to chat with me. Even though they usually look at me like they'd rather projectile vomit on my face instead of holding a conversation with yours truly. Oh well. If you'd like to get a rare glimpse into the minds of the Rocky youth I'd suggest checking out their  urlLink page .

      First thing firsts: I need to address the fact that new comments being added lately simply aren't showing up on the page. At least on my system, anyway. But don't worry; any comments being added are automatically forwarded to my inbox so I'm still receiving them. They just aren't available for the masses to read. I don't know what the hell's going on with Blogger/Blog*Spot lately; there seems to be something brilliant happening every day here. Check  urlLink here  to get status updates.   So, I'll just take a moment to address what was written in these comments. Big thanks to Brodieclerk for once again reminding me that there's situations ten times worse than I've got going on here. Thank you Ross, it always brings cheer and joy to my heart when people recognize that I'm a barking loony. I also thank you for the c-store empathy. Clerks unite!!! And to the enigmatic fellow/lass known simply as G, I must concur that  urlLink Chopping Block  is one kick-ass webcomic.   I suppose I should give an update on my kicking the habit. Am I still going strong? Well, yes and no. After my Tuesday shift turned out to be the worst possible time ever to have discontinued my intake of nicotine (and tar and CO and so forth) I realized with a heavy heart that I'm simply not going to be able to go without my precious cigarettes at work. Not right off the bat, anyway. So, I gave in and bought a pack today. Which should be sort of clear to you, seeing as I'm not typing out bizarre messages involving meat products. But don't worry, I'm not totally off the wagon yet; I'm keeping them at work. It turns out when I'm at home the urge to smoke doesn't hit me as hard so I can pretty much go without. However, as Tuesday night proved, if I don't have a suitable Nicotine Delivery System on the job I'll start to stare down the customers. So I'm going to have one every hour and a half for this week, then tack on an extra fifteen minutes next week, and henceforth until I don't need the damn things while I'm working anymore. The only problem with this system is when I go out on the town, because that's the other time I smoke like a chimney. Oy, we'll see...  But I'm starting to get sleepy. So until next time, keep your feet on the ground but your eye on the sky!

      Someone recently recommended that I should check out the  urlLink Johnny the Homicidal Maniac  comic series. After managing to procure a few copies through many varied feats of strength, I must admit that I'm quite glad I did. Violence rules. But the main reason I'm enjoying it probably has to do with my introduction to  urlLink Happy Noodle Boy , who has since become my No. 1 personal hero. Why, do you ask? Because [pause for effect] today I have quit smoking, hopefully for good. Believe me, when you're in the middle of a nic fit the best your brain can manage is a stream of invective punctuated by several non sequitors. And it's a very nice thing to see yourself represented so well on the page. Anyways, while I come to grips with the choir of agonized screaming voices that have suddenly taken root in my head, I believe I'm going to take a short break from this blogging thing. For a day at least to forever at most. So keep checking back in the meantime! Trust me when I say take it's taking all of my concentration to sttopp myyyseellf... Check it in the maroon dungheap where my mamma's pasta salad goes to play!! Quick! Patch me through to the President's Anus! AAGH!! I CAN'T DEAL WITH MY SCROTAL BARNACLES IN THE SCRUM! Keep that damn crow in the pie! FUCK!! I see you there thinking you have a beautiful voice but the nail's in my foot and I can't reach my tequila!! FUCK OFF!! SHIT COCK ASSHEAD TROLL!!

      I don't claim to be a wonderful person. Fact is, I'm not the friendliest guy you'd ever hope to meet. However, I like to think that I'm fair and honest when dealing with people, and I never attempt to screw anybody over or plot to bring ruin to their family name. Truth is, I'm just an average schmoe trying to make a buck in this world and as such I'm not interested in being a najor-league asshole, no matter how many times I use that term to describe myself. Oh sure, there have been times when I've rightly deserved it, but it's not something I actively seek out.  So why does it seem like people have it in for me lately?  No matter how sincere my smile, no matter how relaxed the body language, no matter how friendly my tone, I've started to be treated rather scornfully from not only by my customers but the population in general. I can't count the number of damn stink-eyes I've been receiving lately. I figure it's only a matter of time before somebody comes in the store and starts waving a gun in my face again.  But so far, these feelings of animosity toward me have been directly expressed only three times in the past three days, and I'm hoping that's all it will be. Frankly, I'm going to have start screaming at someone soon if this keeps up. Granted, these things aren't really that big of a deal. When combined with the general vibe I've been receiving however, I'm starting to feel like these are only the preliminary rumbles before the big 10.0 quake blows everything to shit.   Friday   Yeah, Friday. Typically the time of the week where all the workaday bums go out and get completely shit-faced. However, there was one lady who just couldn't wait until evening. What are the odds that she'd end up at my store? Oh, pretty damn good, I'd say. After rummaging around in her socks (?) for her money for a good five minutes, she braced herself against the counter and attempted to look me in the eye. She started slurring something at me, but I couldn't understand most of it. To end it though, she said "Yeah, you think I'm a bitch. Well, guess what, you asshole, you're the biggest bitch here!" I chuckled a little, then glared at her and replied, "Don't bother coming back, because I'm not going to be serving you." I've always thought that to be a rather hollow threat; after all, who gives a shit if they can't shop at the bloody Rolf store? But for some reason she looked at me like I meant business and stumbled out. Heh.   Saturday   At the end of a long, boring and soul-baking shift, a member of Rocky's youth population - a guy I wouldn't mind seeing flattened by a Mack truck, incidentally - shuffled through the door. To add even more joy to the moment it appeared that he was completely stoned off his ass. This guy usually takes way too long to make up his mind, and him being high was probably going to tack on an extra ten minutes to the amount of time he'd be in the store. But luckily, he went over to the sub cooler right away and threw something in the microwave. I was getting ready for cash-out and thus was not paying too much attention to what he was doing. I looked up however and saw him shoving an ice-cream sandwich into his face. I made a note of it, and when he came to the counter to pay for his sub I asked if there was anything else. Of course, he said no. Good lord. After pressing him about it and pointing out the copious amount of chocolate all over his lips, he finally confessed to it. I bagged his stuff, and as he was leaving he gave me the finger. Sigh.   Sunday   This was not a bad day, I have to admit. But with half-hour to go on the clock somebody saw fit to ensure that I didn't have a hassle-free shift. A lady came to the counter with a package of Halls and asked for a pack of Export A Ultra Light King Size. After pointing out we only carried the regulars she started swearing and knocked over a bunch of stuff on the counter. I was rather dumb-founded, seeing as this was the first time somebody had thrown a shit fit over cigarettes in the three years that I've worked here. May I recommend some gum?  So, that was my weekend. As I said before, this shit when taken by itself is rather minor. But you've got to place them into context with the rest of my life. When you do that, the future isn't looking too good.

      I came upon this article around three months ago, and if I had a blog back then I would have mentioned it. And although it's been in circulation for a while now, I feel the pressing need to bring it up again. You see, I was pondering the so-called 'underground' culture while I was mopping the floor tonight and this came immediately to mind. Is it good? Is it bad? Well, I leave that up to you.    urlLink Are you ready to be... mildly nonplussed?

      Ah, only 164 packs of cigarettes sold today. My conscience can rest easy, knowing that 36 less packs of our smokes are circulating the lungs of our customers, compared to last Friday. And it looks like I'm still going to be working here!   .............  ...   Fuck.  In other news, I seem to have brought ruin upon  urlLink Steve Smith's blog . 'Twas once a hotbed of witty posts and brilliant repartee in the comments section; but after he was kind enough to mention the song parody I did for  urlLink Super Fun Happy Amazing Hour , the amount of comments have sharply declined. Sheesh, and this is how I pay back the first guy kind enough to add links to my sites...  Or more realistically, his regulars are quite occupied with other matters at the moment. But I refuse to accept that. Because quite simply, everything revolves around me.

      I have a confession to make. I love superheroes. I've always loved superheroes. And when I'm an old man farting away in a wheelchair, I'll still love superheroes. Even though I've only owned about ten hero-centric comic books in my life, I've always had a keen fascination with magic men (and women!) in tights righting wrongs and slamming evil. I've formed the briefest of acquaintaces and the longest lasting of  urlLink friendships  around them; I still remember discussions on how Batman could pound the shit out of Wolverine and why Superman isn't as great as everyone thinks he is. I've watched as heroes were  urlLink deconstructed  and revelled in their eventual  urlLink reconstruction . If you ever meet me, I will eventually ask you which power you would rather have; invisibility or flight. (In case you're wondering, invisibility has it, at about 99 percent of people polled. And hey! Hold on, I'm going somewhere with this.) And then comes the ultimate question. If you could have the powers of any superhero, which one's would you like to have?  EVERYBODY answers Spider-Man.  Everybody. And don't say you'd like somebody else's powers, because you're lying. And if you haven't figured out the point of this post yet, you're an idiot.  But first, let's flash back to the end of April two years ago. As is the case with most blockbuster movies, the hype machine for Spider-Man was in overdrive. Nary a minute would go by without a reference to the web-slinger. There were the ubiquitous commercials. There were the product tie-ins. Massive merchandising. And the Calgary Sun rather infamously decided an interview with Canada's biggest Spider-Fan was worth the front page. Now, the typical response to such massive hype as this from the public is a collective "Meh." But not this time. Every new scrap of information concerning Web-Head was gobbled up and followed by a clawing desperation for more. And when opening weekend came the theatres were absolutely PACKED; to the tune of $114 million if I recall correctly. Your humble blogger would be remiss if he didn't say he got swept up in all this as well. Although since I'd been waiting for this movie ever since James Cameron was attached as director, it would probably be better to say that I was leading the charge instead. And given all these inflated expectations, given the longing I had to see this movie swelling in my chest every minute of every hour of every day since the clock hit midnight on New Years 2002, I was probably disappointed, right? You can bet your fucking testicles I WASN'T. (Or ovaries, as the case may be.) This was the only movie in recent memory that made me want to stand up and cheer. That made we want to cry. That made we want to shake my fist at screen and yell, "YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!" This was a rare thing; a blockbuster movie with heart. That it was a movie about one of the greatest superheroes ever created made it all the sweeter. I left the theatre dazed; as soon as I stumbled in the door of our house I told my roommates rather simply that if they didn't go see Spider-Man I was going to kill them. Although my movie recommendations are usually taken with a grain of salt - see Kung Pow: Enter the Fist - they went to see it anyway and conceded that it was as great as I had said. Millions of other people apparently did the same thing, because Spider-Man eventually grossed over $400 million domestic. And thus, the inevitable sequel.  Spider-Man 2. This isn't the title I would have chosen for it. I mean, take a cue from the damn Batman movies! Don't tack a damn number on the end! It would've been far better to call it "The Amazing Spider-Man". That way, for the even-more-inevitable sequels to follow, you have a wealth of other titles to glean from any one of his monthly series. And why am I bitching about the title? Because, quite frankly, that's all I can find to bitch about. This. Movie. Is. Flawless. Forget the hype machine that's once again spinning out of control. Forget all the extraneous celebrity bullshit that's being dragged into the spotlight. And hey, while you're at it, forget any bally-hoo about the special effects. Because as soon as the first frame is in view this movie will have your heart tangled up in webbing. [Pause for groaning.] And isn't that what really matters? Isn't this what movies are for? It takes a movie like Spider-Man 2 to make us realize all the horse manure that's been shoved in our faces ever since Star Wars initiated the blockbuster craze way back when. Which isn't to say that the technical side of this movie is suffering; the amount of loving craft put into every single shot is eclipsed only by the Lord of the Rings series. Raimi and company, take a bow. But the story's the thing, as my uncle says just before he passes out in the fireplace at our family reunions, and this is a wonderful story. And if you don't think so, then you are wrong. So much for the sanctity of opinion, eh? They've managed to make the out-of-mask character development stuff as engaging as the battle sequences. This is a feat that's rarely accomplished by most superhero movies. See Daredevil, for an example. Or don't; can't really blame you there. Even more unbelievable is that the supporting cast turn out to be actual People, not cardboard cut-outs who do bizarre things solely for the purpose of plot. Every exchange is wholly organic; nothing feels contrived. Except for one small part of the train sequence, but what follows will crack the hardest of hearts. Watch and you'll see.  In fact, that's all I really need to say about Spider-Man 2. Watch, and you'll see.  P.S. To Film Snobs: Sometimes things are popular because they're good.  P.P.S. One of the other  urlLink journals  I regularly read posted a rather negative review, saying that it was boring. I'm started to feel disappointed in the younger generation, dagnabbit. In other news,  urlLink Ebert  gave it four stars out of four, which just about makes up for his panning of the first Spider-Man.

         PART 1: The Announcement      Joel:  (singing)   Mop, mop, mop, all day long Mop, mop, mop while I sing this song Gonna mop the floor, gonna make it shine Then I'm going to go huff some turpentine...    Radio:  (song playing)   I'm gonna run to you If the feelings right, I'm gonna...  SQUEEEEEEEE!   (siren goes on for twenty minutes)   Frantic Radio Woman:  OH FUCK! This is the Alberta Emergency Broadcast System! This is not a fucking test! Here's Environment Canada! AAAAGH!   Scientist:  Yo. Heavy shit goin' down near Lacombe and Gull Lake. Lotsa tornadoes be touching down. They headin' to Ponoka to fuck shit up old school. Foshizzle.   Frantic Radio Woman:  We're doomed! DOOMED! This is the New Perfect Storm! So don't use the phone! Bye!   Joel:  'Hwell! Now there's a fine how-do-you-do!     PART 2: Inner Monologue     Man, the store is really dead. This is cool. Now I'm here all by myself! No customers! Whooopeee! Hmmm... what should I do... oh wait, here comes somebody. What a stupid asshole. What is he doing here? Doesn't he realize it's raining right now? Stay home, you fucking douchebag!   Joel:  Good evening, sir!  Customer: Grunt.  Fuck you! I was all set to have a gay old time, and you had to come and ruin everything! I hate you! I hate you, stupid dickhead! Die! DIE DIE DIE!   Customer:  How much is a bottle of Pepsi?  Joel:  (cheery) $1.67, sir!  Customer:  Oh.  What, is our Pepsi too expensive for you, cock-smoker? Huh! Stupid whiny bitch! I'm sick of your bullshit! Oh, I see you're done now. About fucking time. Dumbass.   Customer:  Well, that should be everything. Oh man, is it ever wet outside!  No. Fucking. Shit!   Joel:  Here's your change, here's your bag; thank you, and have yourself a good night!  Customer:  See ya! You too!  Asshole. Well, maybe I'll check out the blogs. Oh. Wait. They said not to use the phone! NOOOO!      PART 3: Amusement      Joel:  (singing and dancing)   Macho, Macho Man! I want to be a Macho Man...    Customer:  Um, hello?  Shit!     PART 4: An Open Letter     Dear Weather,  Everybody complains about the weather, but nobody does anything about it. Well, I'm writing tonight to change all that. Tonight, there was yet another thunderstorm in the Rocky area. That's not what I have a problem with. What I have a problem with is that you decided to send it away with two hours left on my shift. Let me explain something about humanity; we don't appreciate something until it's taken away. Since most of the people in this town are hydrophobic weiners, you severely limited the movement of a good number of our population. I'm actually kind of fond of this, being that less people moving around means less people harassing me over junk food. But once the rain stopped, all these people who were sitting inside decided they would enjoy their new-found "freedom" to move about. Therefore, on top of the typical rush I get during the last two hours, I also had to deal with an influx of said hydrophobic weiners. I would appreciate it if next time you decide to throw a storm at us you would keep it going until after closing time.  Sincerely,  Joel

      I'm taking an ill-advised break from frothy frivolity today, and instead I'm going to indulge in some polemic pontification. Just as a trial run, you see. If I crash and burn, you won't be seeing much more of this here. Cross your fingers and make your wish as to the outcome, because here I go:  All of you should be aware by now of the latest  urlLink  controversy  concerning Michael Moore's latest film, Farenheit 9/11. It's yet another in a string of misrepresentations contained in the movie coming to light, this one concerning the doctoring of the front page of the Pantagraph, a newspaper based in Illinois. Supporters of the film and Moore in general are shrugging this off as no big deal; after all, they say, it was just some simple editing. It's not like Moore out and out lied. I have to disagree with these sentiments, for I believe that the issue at hand is representative of bigger problem. First off, I should admit that I'm ambivalent when it comes to Michael Moore himself. I do think he's doing a valuable service by acting as a dissenter, but I'm not particularly impressed with the actual quality of his dissent. Why? Farenheit 9/11 has one purpose: to prevent Bush from being re-elected. It's an admirable goal, but I'm not so sure it's going to succeed. What a lot of people fail to recognize is that despite the film's box office success, Moore may only be  urlLink preaching to the choir.  The thing is, there's a good portion of the American population who are either a) undecided or b) blindly supporting Bush. These are the people Moore desperately needs to reach with his film. Unfortunately, the stream of reports concerning the misrepresentations contained within aren't exactly inspiring these people to line up at the box office. What's all the more frustrating is that Moore didn't need to resort to these; surely, there should have been more than enough solid material concerning George W. Bush to make a convincing argument without them. What really worries me however, is the potential for a backlash; one which could actually increase and cement in place the popular support for Bush. When all is said and done and it's time for the American public to cast their votes this November, it could be that Farenheit 9/11 will have done more harm than good. It'd be a vicious irony if this film helped Bush win the election rather than making him lose.

      Oh my, have I ever been lax. It appears I'm not fulfilling my end of the bargain. It's been two weeks since I posted about a certain topic, and because of that, I'm not meeting SteveCon standards. This calls for some immediate rectification. I'm lacking anything of quality at the moment, however, so I'm simply going to reprint a conversation I had on MSN Messenger today. It's without the consent of the person of the person I had it with, but I'm not going to reveal who it was, so hopefully the whole karma thing will balance itself out.  Person: Oh, thats rather disappointing....very much like meeting Steve Smith for the first time.   Joel: You mean he's not some bohemian god? Striking down infidels left right and centre? Crushing his enemies, seeing them driven before him, and hearing the lamentations of their women?  [pause]  Person: Not quite..   There, requirements met for another two weeks. We now return to our regularly scheduled blog.

      Okay, I'm breaking my silence on all matters work-related today. Please bear with me as I vent some of my frustrations.  The thing about being in retail/service is that the worst incidents don't automatically make for the worst days. A customer flipping their top, a rack of glass bottles tumbling to the floor or shoplifting does not an awful day make, no matter how unsettling these individual incidents might be. Besides, there's something oddly cathartic about shit hitting the fan. No, the worst days at work are formed by the little things. The minor little annoyances. Individually, they aren't a problem, but when they're stacked up over a period of seven hours they start snapping your synapses. It's like setting a pissed off gorilla loose to wreak havoc in your mind. That bastard'll rip apart your patience and stomp on your tolerance until the mere sight of a customer sends you into a frothing rage.   When I started this, I had in mind a listing of the particular little things that annoy me over the edge of the reason. As is usual with my life, distractions arose and I had to put this post to the side as I dealt with them. While I was busy, I realized that a lot of these things are part of one main issue. It all arises from the nature of the customers on the shift. Certain natures are worse than others; after all, who enjoys work when the customers are feeling antagonistic? But the customer mood behind my worst nights isn't anger; it's boredom. Ennui. People plodding through the aisles; their eyes half-closed. Half-heartedly studying our stock. Tedium writ large. Time flows like molasses. This is how humanity ends; not with a bang, but a whimper. I can try to fight it, but if it continues for too long, I'll eventually start to feel bored as well. Their mood has informed mine, and mine will inform the mood of future customers. It's a stupid cycle that's impossible to break once it's underway. Throw in all the other bullshit and you've got yourself one bad night. Bored AND stressed. What a combination.
