      Hey guys. Sorry bout not posting much at Rhode Island. I was to preocupied with imporant matters of knowledge. Anyways R.I was awesome. We went to Providence, Bristol, Newport, And Block Island. Personally I thought Block Island Was the coolest place on Earth. Its the smallest islamd in R.I We took a ferry there which was awesome. The beaches at Block Island Were Fucking Great. Great waves and nice sand. But its all over now. Sunday night at the Holiday Inn we were staying in some guys ordered escorts (Girls that bang you for bucks) and never paid them. So the girls called their "Pimp" or the muscules of the service and told the guys to pay up. They refused and an argument of some sort broke out. One of the guys pulled out a gun and pistol wipped the "Pimp" the girls went to the front desk of the hotel and called the police. The swat team came and searched every room for the man wid the gun. While this was all Happening me and fucked up family couldnt get in to the hotel so we drived around for like an hour and came back and we finnaily got back in. The end. And they still didnt find the man wid the gun. Well thats about all the writing my sexy hands can handle for one day. See ya ltr
