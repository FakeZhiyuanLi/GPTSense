      yesterday was&nbsp;a blast...had so much fun tat i cant even begin to describe the feelin of it...it was unexpected tho...cant imagine how it all started or happened...just came on spontaneously u know wat i mean...well...all good outings r always unexpected n spontaneous...if its planned then half the kick of it is gone....hahaha...i think tat almost everyone would agree to this point...there were new ppl tat i met..they r great ppl to hang out wit...like really comfortable hangin out wit em...there was however this joker of a guy tryin his hardest to make us laugh n he did in fact made us laugh till we almost roll on the ground....hahaha...rememberin it now i still chuckle at the thought of it...real funny kinda guy u know....n there was this other guy who's kinda serious n at the same time funny as well...also he's really good in singin...very wise in his choice of words n all...given me a couple of advice of which i find to be very true...i appreciated his good advice n will definately try to pay more attention n practice it if i can...another guy was really quiet...don know whether he was shy or just tryin to control himself....last but not least the guy who invited me....he's totally in control of himself n most times full of himself but tat may just b his cover u know like a book cover n all...mayb he's tryin to act cool n b expressionless...tats fine wit me cuz in the end we were all there cuz of the invitation n we enjoyed ourselves to the max...mayb it could have been better if he opened up n not b altogether so cool n witout emotion but then again ppl need time n so just b patient lo...tats probably all it takes n all tat matters at the moment....hehehehe....newayz...patience is a virtue....

      i have been datin my bf for quite a few years..now v r havin a long distance relationship..i have mentioned to him b4 tat i do not believe in long distance n so to save our relationship v gave it a go for half a year...now things have gotten to the extend of us seldom talkin to each other any more n when v do for longer than usual its&nbsp;cuz v r arguing...other than tat v don talk much or c each other much...its like he's leadin his own life n me my own life..his lifestyle is somewat like mine&nbsp;cuz he loves&nbsp;hangin out wit his friends n so do i...durin the weekends when v meet v party together but if v r apart then v party wit our individual friends....last i have seen him was like 3 weeks back...i m feel as if i m driftin away from him cuz i have nothin to&nbsp;say to him when v talk not like b4 n cuz of the career i want to seek v will still b far apart for years to come...i have spoken to him bout it but he&nbsp;only said to give my career chance a year at max....tats kinda selfish when u think bout it carefully...i have a job waitin for&nbsp;me back home but&nbsp;tats not wat i wanna&nbsp;do...tho ppl say its in the genes but i cant accept it cuz its&nbsp;something&nbsp;others would wan me to do but not wat i wan for myself...i&nbsp;have yet to test my capabilities or the extend i can go on my&nbsp;own n not dependin on others to do tat for me...so this is already a major barrier btw my bf n i...he&nbsp;has said tat he understands n does not object but i fear tat it is not as simple cuz&nbsp;if i do actually work here n later he may ask me to leave my job n go back...tats just not how its done...currently&nbsp;i&nbsp;have not yet finish my studies but will extremely soon...it looks like i only have 3 alternatives...first is to get the job n stay to&nbsp;find myself....second is to go back n work...finally is to continue my degree studies n&nbsp;decide later after actually completin my&nbsp;studies..chances of followin thru the final option is slim but there's still hope..tho i prefer the first option...my dad however is not inagreement of my choice...he did express his wish for me to go back...but it does seem unfair to me cuz the least is tat he could give me a chance to do this for myself...obligations have sometimes make me think really hard bout wat i m suppose to do...i do know wat i m suppose to do...its to go back n work..but tats for them not for me...at times ppl have to be selfish to succeed in life tat is y i choose to stay n work for myself n not them...mayb a few years down the road i may return n fulfill my obligations...till now the problem wit decidin on whether to work here or at home remains a mystery still...the problem wit my bf is also another complication i have in my life at the moment...need to find a solution fast...if not i'll have a whole head full of white hair... ;p
