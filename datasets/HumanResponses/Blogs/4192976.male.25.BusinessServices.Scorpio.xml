       Sleep deprivation has kicked in.  For some stupid reason, I could not sleep at all last night.  I laid down, and my eyes would not close.  So I was up all night long, and watched the sun rise.  Got Kim up a little after 5:30, we packed most of everything, and then she took me to work.  I don't really think that I should be driving right now.  I drove here, Kim riding in passenger seat, and could feel my head bob to the side and stuff.  And I hit the curb when I pulled a U turn in front of the building.        Anyway, If everything goes as planned, Kim and Dad will come and pick me up from work and we will head to the cities.  We will eat dinner, and then I am going to SLEEP!!!!      I am not saying cheers this morning because I am too tired.

       Well, it appears that the external email is currently not working for some unknown reason.  No wonder I am getting so much done!!!!      If you write to me on here, I will check it.  If someone wouldn't mind emailing me a test email about once an hour or so, to see if the email starts working, I would appreciate it.      Kim is taking her car out to get tires on it tonight, so we are going to wander Mills Fleet for a little bit to see the sights, do some non-shopping, and putz around for an hour or 2.  Maybe wander out someplace, eat, and then come back.      Hope everybody is having a good day!      Cheers!

       It's Tuesday!!!      Yesterday was a good day, kind of long at work as I worked until 1:30 before taking my lunch.  But that at least made the afternoon go much faster!  Then I got to class, listened to people complain about coding on Thursday, and then had class.      Looking forward to the time in Cali to relax and enjoy some quiet time.  Looking forward to visiting the castle, the beach, and seeing family I haven't seen for a VERY long time.      I got my code FINALLY for CounterStrike, so maybe I will get a chance to play a little bit tonight as long as everything is ready to go and packed.  I also do have to get my homework done at some point, and I didn't get a chance to work on it last night, so I might have to wait to play until after we get home.      We are talking that the weekend after we get back from Cali of going to the swappers meet again and buying more cucumbers and beans to make dill pickles and dill beans.  Kim is so thrilled.  :)      Anyway, that is about all the mumbling that I can muster at this point.      Cheers!

       It is good that today is Monday I think.  I got put to work this weekend, hard work!!!      We got a call at 7:25 on Saturday from Ron and Kathy asking if we wanted to go to the swappers meet.  So they came over and picked us up and took us out there.  I bought $10 worth of veggies! :)  Snap peas, green beans, cucumbers.  Then also bought some pears and peaches.  Tasty!  :)  Walked around eating the snap peas as we checked the other stalls.  Then, got to the end, and when we had walked in, we had seen a stall that had different plants.  So we stopped there on the way out, ended up buying 4 plants.  A maple bush, an Azaliea bush, and two others that I can't remember.  One starts with a W.  So Saturday afternoon, I went home from Ron and Kathys, and started digging out the bushes in the front of the house that we didn't want in there.  Besides, they were the pine bushes that stab you.  And I was tired of being stabbed by them!!!      There were 3 on the left side when facing the house, and I think 5 on the right side.  Then, 2 others on the side of the garage.  So all of those are now gone.  We planted the other 4 on the back of the house, lined them up at the deck, so that will look really nice.  Then we are going to buy some bushes that work well in the shade.  Those will go in the front of the house.        Yesterday was homework.  Finished that and took my test.  So tonight after class, depending on what time it is, I will have to do homework so that I don't have to think about it when I get home.  And I will also have to try to get my tests taken before we leave.      My email may be down indefinitely, so you can try to email me, please do, and if it doesn't work, drop me a comment on here so that I know it is still down.      Cheers from a rainy MN!

       Well, I started the next big part of my job that I hadn't done to date.  I started working the litigation claims exclusively on my own!  The litigation claims are the workmans comp and liability claims that the insurance is denying as didn't happen, or not work comp or liability.  It is a big step, and alot of work.  I have been working on them since 8 this morning, and have finished 2, and I have two more to go.        They are pretty interesting, but a pain in the butt!!!  You have to make sure that you have all the documentation that they want, and you have to make sure you send a copy to each attorney, and then to the office that is workin on the claim.        But at the same time, I am enjoying it because it is something that is totally new, and gives me another level of knowledge that I never would have had if I had not changed jobs!        The attorneys I have dealt with so far are pretty nice, and will help out as much as they can.  You will always get the crabby ones who don't want to help and just be mean, but oh well.      On another note, my head feels better today, but my knees are absolutely killing me!!!  Having them straight hurts, having them bent hurts, standing up hurts, sitting hurts.  Damn it!   I HURT!!!   They hurt a little bit yesterday, but they really kicked in hard this morning.  I would love to take them out and put them on a shelf until I need them, but that would make it difficult to move around today.      And I called the customer service for my game, and I have to send them a picture of the cd, cd key and receipt and they will then send me a new key.  Of course, they didn't tell me WHEN they would send it!!!      Anyway, it is Friday, I am doing something new, I won't get to see Kim at lunch, my knees hurt, I have to go home and do homework.  I think that is enough, don't you?!      Cheers from MN!

       It's Finally Friday!  YEAH!!!!      I have no clue what the plans are for this weekend.  I am hoping to get a membership out at the archery club started up again so that I could make a trip out there, get my sight sighted in, and then start practicing at the different targets and distances.  It is going to be a count down pretty soon to how many days until hunting!!!      I did not go to class last night.  I did not wait for Kim to get over here, her homevisit ran a bit long, so I went home, was going to take my contacts out, and then found that Kim had my glasses and contact case in her car!  She was being nice and bringing them to me!!!      Short and sweet today.  Not much to say, so lets leave it at, ITS FRIDAY!!!!

       Well, here we are again.  The Day After Yesterday.  Yesterday was a good day.  But hopefully, not as good as today!      The every pleasant and enjoyable Coding Class tonight, and if I make it past long break, a miracle has past!      Renn Faire starts this weekend, Highland Games it is.  Possibly go, bring Tucker, and see what trouble he can cause.      Okay, enough of that now.  I am giving myself a headache.      Tried to play CounterStrike last night, had problem after problem, talked to Darin about it, still no solution.  Finally emailed the maker and said, Now what?!  So hopefully we will have something by the time I get home, and maybe be able to play a bit of it tonight.      I started my excel homework for the third time last night, and then quit because I wasn't so sure about what I was doing, so I stopped.  I will work on it tonight if I don't play games, and if I get home early enough.      Tomorrow is going to be tear down day.  I have to finish tearing all the chip board off the walls so that we can wash them.  We are going to be sealing the walls this weekend.  So I think that while I am ripping down, Kim is going to be washing.  Then, Saturday or Sunday, if we don't go to the Renn Faire, we will be sealing.  Sealing has to get done this weekend since we are in Cali next weekend.      Hunting is another day closer, and I still haven't gotten out shooting yet.  Maybe I will pull out the old bow this weekend for a bit.  Boy, this weekend is getting to be pretty busy!!!  I am sure that the archery group is going to have something going on pretty soon.  They usually do close to hunting.      Realized last night how bad of shape the grill is in.  Lit it last night to toss some chicken on, and had a big flame on the right side, and no flame at all on the left.  So we are going to look around, grills should be getting clearanced pretty soon, and then hopefully get one when we come back from California.      Onward with the day!  What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger!  And all that good stuff!!!      Cheers from a chilly Mn!  Saw my breath this morning!!!!

       Kim called, she is heading to the cities today with her family.  It sounds as though it will be a long day for her.  Hopefully she is able to take it easy and eat.  I did hear the words McDonalds and hashbrowns, but she also said that that might be the only food she gets today.      Bought Half Life last night as the CounterStrike was not the correct game that I needed to get to play it with Darin and people.  So we went out and got that last night as well.      Brain just died, so I am off for now.

       Well, last night was an interesting night.  We crawled into bed around 10, and just after that, the phone rang twice, and then stopped.  Went down to check the messages, and Kim had gotten a crisis call from one of her families.  Ended up being on the phone until almost 11:30, then she didn't go to sleep until after midnight.  I crashed after a while and woke up this morning to a VERY tired wife.      I almost finished my entire report last night, I have 2 pages left I think.  But it hit 4:30, and I had to go.  We had to go do some shopping last night.      I took my bow in yesterday, because when I was shooting last in the garage I kept cranking it up because it was too easy to draw.  So it all the sudden started cranking really easy.  Turns out what I had done was cranked it all the way in.  I was at full poundage and didn't realize it!  So as of now, I am pulling 70 lbs, or just under.  They turned it out a half crank so that it wouldn't be in so tight.      We went and wandered around part of the mall, and realized that there is a reason that we don't go to the mall.  Too many young kids who think they are older than they are!!!!  Dang kids!!!!      I am going to be doing homework tonight, and I think Kim is going to try to get into bed early so that she can get some sleep.      Work work work!!!      Take care everybody!      We are supposed to beat the record low here today, and we did yesterday too I think!

       Well, i must say, today is one of those days where those little can holders with little sayings on them comes into play today.  I would rather be HUNTING!!!      The weather is perfect hunting weather, and I am really feeling the itch.  Unfortunately, I can't scratch that itch for another month.  Oi!  I am hoping to become a member at the archery club again so that I can start shooting and get used to this bow sight.  Then I will be ready for all the hunting!!!      And I need that release of frustration.      Plus, I got a string and an arrow rest for that recurve I got at an auction a while back.  I was concerned about being able to draw it, but found I have no problem.  It is a 45 lb draw weight.  I didn't sit there and try to hold it, but I was able to draw it without a problem.  And I was shocked when I found out that I was able to draw my compound at 70 lbs without a problem as well!  But I need that time to sit and vent that frustration.  So hopefully by the end of the month, with everything else, I will get a chance to get out and do some shooting.      My mind is wandering, thinking of those trees, fields, and streams.   Where all the animals, I love so dear, are out playing, eating and drinking.   Hopefully soon, I will be out there too, finding the one to bring home to dinner!      Cheers from a chilly MN and a crazy guy!

       Well, today kind of seems to be dragging on.  Almost lunch time though!  Then off to have lunch with Kim, and relax for 30 minutes before jumping in with both feet back into the rat race.        I have a picture we took with the digital camera of Tucker looking off to the side.  It is a pretty cute picture, and helps the day go on.  Also, the pictures of Kim around me don't hurt either!!! :)      Maybe I will get a chance to pull my bow out tonight and do some practice with it.  It is getting to be time to hone the skills.  I have to buy one new arrow and get new veins on one.  I shot a hole in one again.  I have to stop doing that!  :)  I was shooting with my broadheads the other day, and shot my arrows so close together that I had to pull out 2 arrows together because the broadheads had gotten stuck together.  One blad was in the hole of another, so I had to pull each of them about a half inch at a time, and then get them out.  So I will have to be a tad more careful so I don't break a blade off!      This year for hunting looks pretty promising.  Met a guy at the school, and we are going to go out hunting as often as we can.  Hopefully I will be able to load up on venison this year since I haven't gotten any meat the last 2 years.  I am on deprivation right now.      I am kind of hoping to be able to get Tucker to the point that he will be able to do some hunting with me for birds at some point.  Get his nose trained to the point that he will be able to find pheasant that are hiding in bushes.  :)      Cheers from MN and the funk cloud has lightened slightly!

       Well, today is Tuesday.  I had class last night, it went well.   Teacher decided that since so many people were not there to give us a quiz that we could work on together.  Then, decided that no matter how many you got wrong on it, you still got full points.  Then, instead of lecturing for 4 hours, gave us a form, paired us up, had us each answer a question, and then we went over that in class, and I was home by 8:30 last night.      Then tried to pull down a piece of chip board that was put up by the previous owners of the house.  They felt that it would make the garage look nicer, or something.  We are taking it all down because we have water that is coming into the garage.  It is leaking through the wall it seems.  So we are tearing down, and then will seal the walls so no more water comes in.      Kim and I are definitely looking forward to the trip to California in just over a week.  Seeing relatives I haven't seen in many, MANY years, and getting away and relaxing.      Kim continues to move forward, and my job continues to be good.  I still enjoy it, and am slowly being given more to do.  I am taking over the litigation accounts, and will soon be the one dealing with the attorneys and judges instead of my supervisor.      Cheers from Mn on a day full of FUNK!!      Then, next month, the all important happens.  HUNTING!  Archery hunting opens the second weekend I believe, and it just so happens that opener is the same week as finals.  So I have my last final on Thursday, and on Saturday, I am going to be out at sunrise sitting in a tree, hoping to bring home a bunch of meat.  If that luck happens, I will be bringing home some steaks or tenderloins to toss on the grill, and will slowly cook them for consumption with some potatoes and probably a beer.      Tucker has continued to be himself, and that is a lab body with the bassett legs.  He is tall enough to drink water out of the kitchen sink now.  Yes, that is what I said.
