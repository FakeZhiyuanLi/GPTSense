      Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.     It seems like such a simple little thing - crawling. For Tommy, it was no big deal. He learned how to roll at a early age and used that to propell himself around. He crawled at about 10 1/2 months which is a little late. But I don't remember it being a big deal.     For Abby, it's been like a personality transplant. She's almost a brand new baby. Well, OK, she's still going to be Abby in a lot of ways, but man, is she a lot easier to manage now. She loves to crawl around and get into trouble. She explores everything. Her favorite hang out is the dog bowls. Kiki, our Lab mix, has a raised table for her dog bowls. Abby scoots over there at every opportunity to play in the water and eat the dog food. Fortunately, Kiki does a pretty good job of eating all of her food, so there's not much left for Abby. You go get her and she laughs and smiles. She knows she's causing trouble. What a cutie.     She's been such a little fusser that it is so nice to see her happy. And she gets tired. You can tell she's ready for her nap because she'll just sit in place and play with her toys. Scoop her up - plop her in her crib and she'll sleep a good two hours. What a great little girl.

      Every morning Tommy wakes up and says "What day today?" He's pretty good at the days of the week and knows that on Saturday and Sunday Daddy is home. We have playgroups on Wednesday and Friday. On Tuesdays, he goes over to his Great Aunt Cathy's for the day.  Mondays is our day to decompress.     We never really do too much with the kids. As terrible as that sounds, it really is a pain to get them out of the house. Besides I don't think they care too much one way or the other. This past weekend we saw Laurie Berkner at Ravinia (review to follow). It was rainy at first so we got a little wet, but came home in plenty of time for nap. Tommy took the world's shortest nap. Steve's been attempting to set up my sister's stereo for a month now. So he took Tommy over to Liz's to get the amp all hooked up. I got to spend some time with Abby which was nice. She can be amazingly pleasant sometimes.     Tommy and Steve got home and without much incident got a bath and went to bed. He also woke up a little early on Sunday and was a complete pistol all day. Another short nap but an early bedtime of 7:00. It was actually nice to have some time to unwind before going to bed ourselves.     This morning on Monday, Abby started wailing at 5:00 which is just too darn early. When I got her she was still inconsolable. I gave her a bottle and put her back down. I never do this because it screws up the schedule for the rest of the day. She was so tired. It's 8:00 now and she is still asleep. It's been a nice quiet morning.     Tommy got up like a Jack in the Box at 6:00 shortly after I got Abby back down. It's like a game of Wack a Mole around here. One goes down, one pops up. Anyway he seems to be in a good mood. He told me over breakfast he feels better today. I asked him how he felt yesterday and he said "I felt tired yesterday." He can be very self aware in retrospect.     His second question of the day is now "Where are we going today?" On Mondays, the boring answer is "Absolutely nowhere baby." It makes the day long. I enjoy getting out more than they do. But to get the week started off right, we need to chill at home.     Well it could be worse. I could have a real job.

       urlLink Laurie Berkner  was at  urlLink Ravinia Festiva l for a Kraft Kids Concert on Saturday, July 17, 2004.     This was the first kids' concert I had seen at Ravinia. I've been there previously for classical and pop concerts. It's an outdoor festival kind of place with a pavillion and lawn seating. For classical concerts, we usually spring for the pavillion seats. My dad's not real big on picnicing on the lawn. Neither is my husband.     We arrived early and got rock star parking. That was great. We found a spot on the lawn and spread out blankets to claim some real estate for the families that were going to join us. Tommy and I went to the rendevous point at the gift shop. Then the skies opened up and it rained. A nice soaking rain that had been threatening all week. Although it was nice for the parched flora, it did not do too much for the spirits of the fauna including all of the toddlers and preschoolers in attendance. Of course the kids were not quite as put out as the parents. Come on - Laurie Berkner and puddles to splash in - what could be better. The gift shop did brisk sales of umbrellas.     About 20 minutes of rain later, the clouds parted and the sun shone. We returned to our grassy patch where Steve has spent the rain shower under an umbrella with Abigail. He actually said she was pretty good. She can be a bit fiesty. We had hooked up with Michelle, Jacob and Ella. One of our playgroup friends. No one else was to be found.     The concert started right on time. Steve brought Tommy up close to the pavillion so he could get a look at Laurie. That way he didn't think we had come all this way with thousands of other people to sit around and listen to a Laurie Berkner Best of CD. I think he twigged on to the fact that it was really her. She started off with "Victor Vito." A cute, funny song. Abby even seemed to enjoy the music and start bopping along in her strangely rhymic way.     The kids all around really did enjoy the music. Nothing is cuter than seeing a bunch of little kids jumping around to kids's music. And Laurie has really great songs. She played all of her hits - "We are the Dinosaurs," "Let's Go Swimming," "Buzz, Buzz," "Song in her Tummy," "Pig on her Head," "Moon, Moon, Moon" and a bunch of others I'm forgetting.  I never thought I would be able to suffer through children's music. Some of it I just can't stand - I'd put my eyes out if I ever had to see the Wiggles in concert.  But Laurie's songs are sweet and a little quirky. You'll find yourself singing a tune when the kids are down for naps. For about a year, I sang Tommy "Moon, Moon, Moon" every night before bed. I miss doing it actually.     Laurie Berkner is pregnant and due in September. (cograts Laurie and Brian!) As someone who vaguely remembers last summer as a hugely pregnant woman, I'm amazing she still has the energy to perform for kids. Besides playing her guitar sidesaddle, I didn't really notice anything different about her. If you ever have a chance to see her live, I would suggest it. I think she's just wonderful. And I'm not even three years old.
