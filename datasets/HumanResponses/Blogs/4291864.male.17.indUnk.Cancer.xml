       urlLink Finally some reform in the intelligence community ! Republican Senator Pat Roberts proposed a bill that would  urlLink dismantle the CIA  and place all operations under the control of a National Intelligence Director (NID). In his proposal the NID would be given budgeting powers over the departments of treasury, energy, homeland security, and defense intelligence. Also, the CIA's three main departments (science and technology, operations, and intelligence) would be split into three different organizations which would each be lead by an Assistant NID. And finally the Pentagon would have to surrender control of it's three largest intelligence departments.  Senator Robertson said he had support from eight out of the nine Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee. He had not discussed the plan with Democrats or the White House, although he has earned praise from many Democrats, including presidential hopeful John Kerry. The White House said it looked "forward to reviewing the details of Senator Robertson's proposal." Although I doubt it will be met will approval from the White House. President Bush had planned on appointing a NID, but he had a different approach to the details from the NID's power. The NID, under the president's plan would not be able to hire or fire anyone, would not have control over the intelligence budget, and would not be a cabinet member (But of course! Why would you want the head of national intelligence at your cabinet meetings? *note sarcasm). So basically under the president's plan the NID would be a figure-head appointed to make it look like he's working for reform in the intelligence community.  Question... Is it smart to give one man so much power? The Bush Administration's plan is bad because they give the NID no power, but Pat Robert's plan almost seems like it's a little too much.  In other news... The Swift Boat Veterans for "Truth" have  urlLink finally admitted  that they don't have any proof to back up their claims. Okay? So why the hell is this still an issue? Oh right, because they keep airing the ads... oh okay... huh. Well those ads may be going off the air soon though, because  urlLink recent evidence  found by the Kerry campaign ties Bush to the Swift Boat Veterans for "Truth". Does this mean that the ads will stop? Probably not anytime soon. But atleast Kerry has the backing of the guys that  actually  served with him.   urlLink Wayne D. Langhofer  backed Kerry when he said that fire was coming from both sides of the river, contrary to the story given by the Swift Boat Veterans for "Truth". And FINALLY, under intense pressure from Democrats and Republicans alike,  urlLink President Bush denouced the ads  from the Swift Boat veterans. Although the Bush campaign did also write letters to television stations  urlLink asking them not to air John Kerry's newest ads.  Which leads me to this... What the hell? Can they do that? TV stations can't pick and choose which canidate's ads they want to air! C'mon now! That's illegal use of the president's position. He can't influence the ads aired on TV by his opponents. If he has a problem he should take it up with the FEC (I'd love to see him get shot down).

      What does this administration think they are doing? A story broke August 7th (I'm a little late, but give me a break I just made this blog a couple days ago) that the  urlLink identity of a mole within Al Qaeda had been leaked , and after appearing in US newspapers,  urlLink US officials confirmed his indentity . Excuse me... but what the fuck? I'm no terrorism expert, but it seems to me that it might be a little difficult to get a mole to infiltrate deep into Al Qaeda. Especially when you tell the world about him! Tim Ripley, a security expert who writes for Jane's Defense publications, said: "You have to ask: what are they doing compromising a deep mole within al Qaeda, when it's so difficult to get these guys in there in the first place?" Good point Tim, I couldn't have said it any better myself. The leaked information prompted a number of hasty arrests on suspected Al Qaeda members in the UK, and the terror alert level was raised in the US. Which leads me to something else...  Is it just me? Or does anyone else see that the Bush Administration is blatantly playing politics with these terror alerts? I mean, Kerry announces Edwards as his running mate, media goes crazy, attention is on Demo... WAIT! Terror Alert! Then the DNC, Kerry makes great speech ( urlLink seriously it was great ), public attention is on Kerry, media is focusing on Ker... Terror Alert! Not only is the timing so freaking obvious, but every time I see Tom Ridge he spends 2 minutes talking about the actual alert, and 20 minutes reminding us how great George Bush is. They aren't using this for politics at all (note the sarcasm)! Next time I see Tom Ridge I think I just might kill myself. Because everytime I see that man it reminds me that to this government, playing politics is more improtant than national security.

      More news on the  urlLink Swift Boat Veterans for "Truth" . There are many other things I could have talked about, but this is getting  urlLink sticky . It is definitely going to be a tough couple of months leading up to the November election, and  urlLink Kerry looks like he's getting upset . And I'm not surprised. I'm just glad Kerry is  urlLink taking action  now. He's launched a  urlLink new ad  featuring John McCain. Hopefully this can counter the damage done to the truth, but unfortunately it may just make him look even more guilty (you can see the ad:  urlLink HERE ). But if Kerry plays his cards right, he may be able to prove that Bush was  urlLink linked  to the Swift Boat Veterans for "Truth". If he can prove the link between them Bush will have to pay more money for every ad he airs. This could be     HUGE  for Kerry considering Bush has raised more money (and still is because the RNC is later than the DNC). This battle is gaining more ground and becoming even urlLink  more intense  as it grows. It is a shame it is even an issue, but I'm afraid the  urlLink media coverage  of this event has made it too big to not be an issue this year. The real issues should be about Iraq and the economy, not something that happened over 30 years ago. You know Bush is reaching for something on Kerry when he has this to pull out his ass.  Finally some good news for Kerry this week. One of his urlLink  fellow officers  (you know, one of the guys that  actually  served with him)  urlLink broke his 35 year silence  this week and came out to defend Kerry. I guess this guy can't stand  urlLink liars  either.

      Now during an election year I expect to hear a lot of bullshit in the form of political ads. And when I say bullshit I mean half truths and flashy pictures to woo you towards a candidate. But this year topped them all with an ad that was much more than that. It was 100% Grade A Bullshit.  I'm talking about the  urlLink Swift Boat veterans for "Truth" . I just still cannot get over the fact that people can actually get on TV and crap lies all over the name of a political candidate. I mean even the "approved by George Bush" commercials have some truth to them (Although Bush ads are misleading, read  urlLink Here  and  urlLink Here ). Although I do hear that laws attempting to stop candidates from lying to voters have been experimented with on the state level... they unfortunately are not effective. It is actually a right for a candidate to lie to us ( urlLink how stupid is that ).  Anyway... getting back on topic... I really think it's stupid how a bunch of guys who never served with Kerry can get on television and flat out lie about how they served with him and how he wasn't a hero and all that  urlLink bullshit . They didn't even serve with him! They didn't fucking serve with him! And now they are going to have a  urlLink second ad  coming out. Then you got Cheney practically calling Kerry a pussy. I mean... what kind of pussy goes to Vietnam, is wounded 3 times, and earns more medals than I care to recall? Not a Bushy pussy, I can tell you that. That's right,  urlLink Bush was AWOL . Whoa! Not news to me! But seriously folks... don't believe me? Well... apparently  urlLink Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Defense confirmed that Bush was AWOL . And just for the hell of it:  urlLink Link ...  urlLink Linkage ...  urlLink Linkageness . But atleast  urlLink Kerry  is  urlLink standing up for himself  and urlLink  defending his war record , not to mention taking urlLink  legal action . I mean... it's not like Bush doesn't have any  urlLink links  to the Swift Boat veterans for "Truth". But just in case you still don't believe me, here are his  urlLink official military records , his  urlLink after action combat reports , and  urlLink command history for Coastal Division 11 in 1969 . And here is a nice little  urlLink ad from John Kerry  to top things off.  Also, on a lighter note, Larry Thurlow, a man who served in a boat in John Kerry's group has made claims that Kerry's boat didn't come under fire when he rescued Lt. James Rassmann from the Bay Hap River. Yet a strange and troubling pattern begins to emerge as the truth shows that once again, a Swift Boat veteran for "Truth"... is  urlLink lying yet again .
