      Ok today was all right. got up showered blah blah blah. ok I then went to the hobby store with gary to look at remote control nitro cars. they are really cool and some can go speeds up to 70 mph i really want one for my birthday in a couple months. well anyways i then went to the gym toda and had my trainer it was my last time with him. i thought he was ok but he had some foreign accent so it was kind of hard to understand him. after the gym i went shoping with amy, my sister, and gary. we went to target, burdines, and bealls it was really boring.   finally i got home went to katies house for a while which was ok and man some one needs to put amy on some medication or someting cause she is hyper. well not that bad but... you know, and not only that she keeps on thinking im going to abuse junior there cat or kill it but id never to that. well i left went home had a stupid boring piano lesson big whoop!then went up stairs and played some X Box which kept me busy for a while.   this all leads me up to now me typing this blog. I hope tomorrow is going to turn out ok but by the looks of it i dont think its going to be that great.

       well finally i got back home from my trip to phoenix Arizona. it was awsome. i had a great time. i saw 2 marlin games while i was out there and i looked at some condos and houses for my uncle because he really likes it out there and wants to buy a second house. that was ok. is soo cool out in phoenix its all desert and cactus and weird shrub plants grow all over. i saw lots of mountains. in fact they were surrounding us, we were in a valley i thought that was kind of neat.    well anyways im really glad to be back. today i just hung out went to the gym and ate dinner at mama mias with my grandparents,sister,gary,and my mom it was all right. right now i kind of have mixed emotions about going to school i want to and then again dont want summer to end but i guess i want to go back.      i think tomorrow or the next day jake and luke get back i cant wait to see them i want to badly i want to hang with someone i havent in a week especially them they have been gone like forever.   well that has been every thing till now i will post later.
