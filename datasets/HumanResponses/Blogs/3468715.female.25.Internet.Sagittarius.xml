       I am an 18-year-old girl studying BBM and from a well-to-do family. About 6 months ago, one day when my mom sent me to the market, I met a fruit-seller. He was a farmer from a village about 500 km away. We got chatting and he gave me a big discount. I have met him a number of times since then, I even offer to go to the market to buy fruits now. Last week, he asked me if I would go with him to his village. The problem is I know he is married with 3 kids and he has his parents and a younger sister to look after. I also know he loves me a lot and that I love him too. Should I leave my family, my studies, my friends, my fashionable wardrobe, my two-wheeler and get on to the roof of the bus to his village with him?    I:  Absolutely. Remember, our lives are ruled by destiny. So, it was destiny that brought this man into your life and now that he has offered to keep you with him you should take it up. But don't hurt your parents in the process. Tell them gently and make them understand that you love this man. Don't worry about missing out on the latest movies, cable TV, your two-wheeler, your education etc. These are all small things in the long run and don't really matter. More over, when you are busy looking after his parents, sister, kids and trying not to get in the way of his first wife, you will not have the time for any of this. All the best!   H:  My dear, very few of us are fortunate enough to find our soul mates. So what if yours happens to be a fruit seller with a wife and three children? Would you love him any more than you already do if he was an investment banker in a multinational bank? Surely not!  As for your family, in due course, they will accept the relationship once they realize you are truly, deeply, madly happy. And as for your city-slick lifestyle, don't even bat your bronze-painted eyelid before giving it up! Who says you can't keep up your identity in a village? So go ahead and flaunt your wardrobe but be sure to add some quaint, rustic touches. Education?! A day at the fields is worth 10 years in university! So you go girl!       I am a 32-year-old married woman with a 4-year-old daughter. My husband is a trainer in an MNC bank and travels out of town often. My 22-year-old brother-in-law stays over at our place when my husband is traveling to give me and my daughter protection. I used to feed him with my hands and treated him like my own son. Last month, when my good-looking father-in-law tried to fix an alliance for him with a girl from a nice family, he refused and declared that he is in love with me. My husband loves his brother very much and has never denied him anything. When he got to know that his brother is in love with his wife, he has offered to divorce me so that I can marry his brother. His father is also OK with the idea since my brother-in-law has agreed to adopt my little daughter as well. But I am still confused. Should I marry my brother-in-law?    I:  You are in a difficult situation. On the one hand, you have a brother-in-law who loves you, wants to marry you and even adopt your daughter. On the other, your husband is more than willing to go with the plan. But from your letter, I get a feeling that you are not in love with either your current husband or brother-in-law. You are in love with your father-in-law. There seems to be lots of chemistry between both of you. Is that the case? If it is, then you should talk to all three men and make it clear that you want a divorce from your husband, give up your daughter for adoption to your brother-in-law, marry your father-in-law and go on a long honeymoon.    H:  My suggestion is rather simple and old fashioned. Stay married to your current husband and "open" your marriage so that you can be intimate with your brother-in-law as well as your father-in-law. This will give your brother-in-law the chance to find his own bride and in due course, you could even consider partner swapping. I am sure your husband will really appreciate this thoughtful gesture. However, you have not made any mention of your-mother-law. How does she feel about the whole situation? You are honestly lucky to have one big happy family. All the best!      I am a 23-year-old lawyer from a big city. I recently visited Patna for a friend's wedding. On the day of the wedding, I was returning home late in the night when three men in a car tried to pick me up. I started running but the men kept gaining on me. A large man, driving buffalos, with a stick in his hand stepped out of a side street suddenly. He immediately figured I was in trouble and beat up the three guys with his stick. He then walked me home and on the way, told me he was a local gangster who had stolen the landlord's buffalos to teach him a lesson. It's been a month since I returned, but I haven't been able to forget this gentle soul who saved my honor. How can I repay him?    I:  You are a good girl who knows the value of saving your honor. The man who saved it seems to respect women and does it without expecting any favors in return. But you must show him your appreciation. Since you say that he is a local gangster in Bihar and we all know what the crime scene in Bihar is like, my suggestion is that you could offer to be the dancer at one of the parties he might throw for his fellow gangsters or politicians. If you are not confident about your dancing skills, watch a few of Shilpa Shetty movies and pick up a few of the  jhatka  tricks. The other idea would be to offer to tend to his own and stolen buffalos and cows. You could even do up the interiors of the  tabela  as a mark of your gratitude.   H:  It is indeed very thoughtful of you! Instead of material gifts and tangible gestures, why don't you repay him with some positive energy generated through long distance Reiki or transcendental meditation? If you are unsure about the procedure, contact your nearest Reiki center - they will probably charge you a nominal fee of Rs. 5,000 for a 10 minute energy transfer session. May the force be with you.      I am 16 years old and in desperate trouble. About 4 months ago, we got a phone call at home. I picked up the phone and the person on the other end asked to speak to my father. He had the best voice I have ever heard. He is a friend of my father's and visited us 2 months ago. I could not see his face, but just from hearing him talk, I know that he is perfect for my 20-year-old sister. He is everything that she says she wants in her husband. I have been trying to trace him without asking my parents for his phone number or address. But there just doesn't seem to be a way out. I am now very depressed and want to commit suicide because I have failed to fulfill my dear sister's wishes. You are my only hope now. Can you help me?    I:  I am so touched by your generous love for your sister. She is indeed lucky to have a caring sibling like you. What you could do is ask your parents the person's name. Pretending that you are just remotely curious might help. Once you have the name, take the local phone directory and look for the name. If it's a common name, you might have about 2000 names to sift through. But if it's a less common one, you might be lucky and not have more than 400 names to zero in on him. Then it's a matter of getting your sister and the man to meet and see how things go between them. If, as you say, he is indeed your sister's ideal man, then nothing else - your parents, his (may be) wife, his (another may be) children, the age difference, your concern over your sister's well being instead of your studies - will matter. I wish you all the best in your search.   H:  Why do I sense a streak of martyrdom in you? Dear girl, ask yourself. Don't YOU love this man? If the answer is a timid 'yes', ask yourself till you hear a resounding 'YES'! If you do love this older gentleman, why are you sacrificing him for your sister, however much you love her? It was YOU who heard his magical voice in the first place and you deserve to be united with him. About finding him, don't look for shortcuts. Declare your love for him in front of your parents. As he is your father's good friend, your parents will be genuinely happy about the excellent choice you have made. I wish you all the best!

       This piece is an indicator that Indu is getting her social life in order, after migrating to the mountains. Looks like she's now all geared up to write Cosmopolitan style, DIY articles, applicable exclusively in the wilderness. Here’s one that offers dating tips in the Himalayas.    Twenty-something, ready for a relationship, have done the dating, online search, experimenting, and giving-up routine? In addition, have a romantic notion of finding your knight on the hairpin curves of the Himalayas? Then our pointers on flirting in the  pahads  might help.  -	The urban concepts of wooing, dating and then determining – over a period of few days or weeks – does not hold good. You meet, you chat, have a couple of cups of butter tea, exchange numbers and you are on. And don’t expect to be treated to long-stemmed roses or candies. Women in the mountains are treated like human beings, no special attention or favors are given or expected.  -	You won’t find your software engineers, investment bankers or corporate legal advisors here. Your true catch would be a climber, a horseman or a hot air balloon or para-gliding pilot. Do your homework and make a list of conversation topics in case you decide to hit on one of them.  -	It’s great that you speak English. But if you try to flirt with a mountain man in it, your success will be limited. Most of them are most comfortable in Hindi-flirting. If you are not sure of the genders and grammar in Hindi, start brushing up now.  -	The language barrier again rules out long-drawn conversations on mails, instant messengers and SMS. Polish your PC skills; it will be far more fruitful.  -	Don’t be a Victorian damsel in distress. If the guys see you complaining about every small  chadai , you will only get suggestions and advice to go jogging everyday… not an invitation to ride pillion on their Enfield Bullets.

       What follows is the excerpt of a conversation with Indu - when both of pondered our single status on MSN messenger - while I was supposed to be working my posterior off and she was supposed to be outdoors, breathing the mountain air. Instead, we had this slightly bizarre conversation - me from work and she from a cyber cafe - a conversation that made her compose Playing Bachelorette - the hilarious piece of non-fiction that details our non-existent love lives.      I: why like this I wonder... others seem to find relationships that are tough, but very workable H: I don’t know... I thought at least you had it figured out I: :) believe me even I did H: I am perversely glad we are now in one happy boat :D H: we'll just sail and try to fish ok I: one happy, single boat H: we'll bait, look and throw it right back H: ok? I: yeah yeah...  H: heheheh H: I am imagining H: both of us bobbing up and down in a boat H: and sitting with fishing rods I: hehehehe even I picture it I: in one of those yak hide boats in Tibet!!!!!!!! H: baiting weird men and pushing them back and saying "oh yuck, bad one" H: hehehehe I: result of reading return to tibet yesterday H: shit I want to read it I: or "uuggh, not this" or once in a while "man, this one is good... but hang on, he is taken or that he is gay" H: Heheheheheee I: You  must... I finished it... its great H: or "awwwwww too small" H: "too ugly" H: "too dumb" H: "... married" I: or maybe "u will like this one, not me" H: "corporate" I: "unromantic, boring" H: "for you... "lollll I: "brotherly" I: Heheheheheh H: "ah! barua boy! this is the ONE" I: just let him open his mouth for the right reasons H: "perfect. but thinks I am fat black and ugly... and oh! dumb" I: Or at least open his mouth at all... if it is peter peter H: ask kaushal if he thinks we are fat black and ugly no H: Lollllll I: "thinks I am benhji types" H: "this is a city shitpot" H: ishte aythu! I: "this ones in my hands but eyeing u" H: we should write columns for ivillage I: heheheheh, full agony aunt cols H: "has a bitch for a mother"! I: actually we should write those questions for weird sexologist or agony aunt cols H: Absolutely H: good money I: where we end up falling in love with our brother in-law or neighbours father I: u and k can turn sexologists: I: :D H: you can be the agony aunt! H: wow... fabulous racket! I: absolutely... k already calls me one H: G can give spurious business advice I: We will start a feature syndicate... I: and free Pepsi H: yeah!  I: there, all our cares taken care of... we can even do this from Manali I: so pack your bags and return H: and k can say " drop everything like a hot brick and come to the mountains" at the end of every answer I: Or "everyone's got to live their own karma" H: Hehehehehe H: Shit H: we are brilliant! H: hey hang on... I have to fw something to you I: u mean brilliant bitches?? :D H: yeah! we think from our ovaries H: this is courtesy conversation with uma I: hahahahahah, I love that I: can I put that as my nick??

H: actually, she said I sometimes think I write from my ovaries I: hehehe, yeah, that’s why we take things sooo seriously or over react like cows in heat H: cows in heat??!! H: have you even seen one? I: nope, but guess its possible... we feel like a cow and we over react like bitches in heat, so cows in heat possible alva? H: Man H: you are brilliant H: that’s very sound logic indeed H: cows in heat I: heheheheh, but its true

       This one is by Indu, my best girl friend, co-escapist, co-conspirator, sounding board, occasional guide, sporadic philosopher and latent conscious-keeper. Indu used to be the most sensible 25-year-old around till a few months ago. She had it all – a prudent disposition, a head on her shoulders, a real job, a devoted boyfriend, a fancy apartment in the making, and as an anti thesis, people like me for friends. Then, one day, she decided to start operation Clean Sweep. She chucked her job, gave up the boyfriend, borrowed my purple rucksack and decided to go on a vacation to the mountains. She went. She saw. She stayed. And the piece that follows is the result of one of her many reminisces in the mountains. (I however DO hope she’s not smoking the riot of hash the grows just outside her house in Manali.)    Playing Bachelorettes – that’s what we call it. The rules are simple: ignore your own ability to attract the members of the opposite sex, if necessary deny it and make sure you do all the bachelor things…hang out with the guys (the ones who would never fall in love with you or you with them), do the guy thing, be single with a vengeance. In short, treat yourself and people around you like furniture and expect to be treated the same way.  Wonder if Hema and I have managed to master the game’s nuances. We hang out with extremely ‘safe’ guys – G and K. G is in love with Hema but their relationship is in such a comfort zone that even by her denying him and his feelings, they manage to remain great friends. Hema treats him like a good combination of ready escort, protective brother and a sounding wall. He almost seems to go down on his knees when he is with her but respects her feelings and is too sensible to mess up the friendship. The only worry is that he might not bring himself to go out with another woman as long as Hema is around and available.  Then there is K, on his own trip, too much in love with his free, wild, mad, polygamous state. You can flirt with him, make out with him, go down on your knees, get him stoned or dread drunk, but absolutely no danger of him turning around and declaring everlasting, eternal love and holy matrimony ‘until death do us part’. Amen. You want a part of his life? You are more than welcome. You have hopes of getting him to share a piece of yours? You must be dreaming! He is good at what he does – loving the single life, living the dream, figuring out life, love and universe and inspiring the whole world and its aunt to do the same. And there is the fact that for K, everything and everyone else is incidental. If we are there, great… if we are not, well, no harm done.  So there we are, the four of us – a slightly messed up Hema, a sensible G, a tripped K and a highly confused me. Rocking along in one trippy boat in the waters of the oceans of singledom. Trippy, coz all of us seem to be rowing to our own ends at our own speed. Sure, there are flashes of un-singlehood but the call of the lonesome brethren is too strong. After every attempt at jumping off the boat, we come back to its safe confines. Yippee! Let’s drink to our singlehood.  Literally, it’s like fishing for ‘other fish’ in the sea. Pick one up, look at it, comment on it and throw it back.  “Yuck! Brahmin SE types. Must be frustrated as hell. No way!”  -Splash!- “Hmm, interesting, but wait! It is in my hands but making eyes at you! Back you go.” -Plonk!- “Sheesh, boring!” -You get the idea- “Brotherly”  “Preachy”  “BO! And can’t think beyond computer games!”  “Thinks it is the answer to all women’s prayers (lets not mention the fact that it does look like it)”  “Man, this one is it… but it’s taken” or “it’s gay”  “It would be easy to fall in love with this one, but it thinks I am fat, black and ugly… not to mention dumb!”  “For you, Hema / Indu”  “This one’s on a rebound. Let’s leave it for some time”  You get the drift. Either there are just no eligible people around or we are too picky and too self absorbed. Yes, we all know that there are no perfect people or relationships. But all that we say are just excuses. Think all of us are just too in love with the freedom that being single gives us. And it is the idea of putting off the finality of marriage a little longer.  K does it by staying over 14000 ft and promptly getting a feet-itch when he comes any lower. G does it by staying in love and always in touch with Hema, not giving himself room to meet anyone else. Hema does it by constantly having crushes, being on self-discovery trips and in love with the idea of being in love. I do it by steadfastedly ignoring my hormones and being the most ‘sensible’ and ‘responsible’ 25-year-old around.  And then there are the ‘singlehood’ things we do. We sit in countless cafes and comment on every other person doing the couple thing around us. We run down married friends and pity their states. We pretend to be 16, that there are still many years left before we take the big plunge. We are thankful not to have the evils of relationships (emotional baggage, answerability, boredom, uncertainty, envy of singlehood) while ignoring the good points (hmm… hang on, lemme think of one… ok, some other time!) and between the 4 of us, we have found our surrogate better halves to come with us to movies or drinking, to give us an ego massage or ego blow as the need arises.  Pathetic, you say? Thank you, but we didn’t ask you. There were other members to this club earlier, but they have drifted apart now – either having gotten married or actively pursuing it. Uma, Tanu, Chinu – we value your inputs and if you decide to change your mind, you are welcome. Chetan, Tariq – you are great guys but letting you in our club might endanger our carefully created emotional and hormonal balance.  There we will be, bobbing along, till one or more of us finally decides to get a tad too risky and gets married. At that point, we hope there will be others to take over and make us look silly for having given it up.
