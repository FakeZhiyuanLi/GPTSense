       My time has cume and I shall Not be mist or remembered As the kid who killed him self Over a girl but a girl that he Had loved and cared for all The hard time that they went Through I shall not feel the Pan when my Neck breaks From the rope that Witch I Will hang from tonight and Now I leave u with tears and Hearts broken sad thoughts And bad memories of me but Time will past friends will For get what happened To me but there will be Those times of hardness And gilt days remember Me as the kid who tried to Fix his life.

         I wander around at night  Looking for my home but  Nun of the homes look  Like mine at all to me  The silent naberhood  Gives me the Goosebumps  Up my back and down  My arms the sound of  Wind whistling through  The trees get to me as  I walk down the sidewalk  The sound of leaves on the  Ground moving from the wind  Make and Erie sound that can  Scar kids till they scream from  There freighting fears from  Deep with in them the nightmare  Continues at night when you’re thinking  Of wear you’re at fear can’t kill you only  Reality.

       The silence of the night is Like music to my ears and I feed on the living to stay Alive u humans think its cool To be undead always feeding Never to see the sun only out At night to feed and kill well to Me the taste of blood on my tong Is so sweet and good the drive to Feed is unbearable to stand u will Go mad and insane for 5 days but After that its all smooth so if u think U still want to be one of us then tern The neck and let me suck your blood And let me tern u into one of us so don’t Be afraid now cume cume it only herts after A wile but u get use to it the pan that is so feed With us and become a child of the night like the Rest of us.
