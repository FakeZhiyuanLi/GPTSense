      Staunch, religious-conservative Republicans are just as much the problem as annoying, pussy liberals. Republicans are no longer the party devoted to freedom.  They're mainly a religious party, who governs us based on their religious philosiphies. Even besides religion, they no longer believe in gun rights, and they made the "Patriot" Act. They claim they're for "small government" but it's quite the opposite. But back to religion, it's annoying to have some radical Christian government tell the country that "sex is bad" and so forth- John Ashcroft is like, the epitome of the religious, authoritarian Conservative. Ashcroft has spearheaded a huge anti-porn campaign, and has supported way tighter FCC regulations. Both things that majorly piss me off. This whole Christian Crusade against abortion, sex, porn, drugs, YOU NAME IT... DOES NOT belong in our national policy. I've had enough of these annoying fundamentalists imposing their will on me. Hey, you church organizations and lobby groups- preach to your own people whatever whe hell you want- But keep it outta my government.

      It really sucks to be both an outdoors enthusiast and an out-of shape fatass at the same time. But, Lyle Canyon is an very easy trail (or at least the first part before the pass) and it should go relatively smoothly. We're (my parents and I) just going to hike a few miles in, stay at a nice campsite a couple nights, and hike back.   To accompany me in this new trip is a new backpack, the Osprey Aether 75- a sweet pack that totally redefines the word "ergonomic". Also, I finally get my own single-person tent (not the $250 tactical one I wanted from TADgear), which means I can finally sleep alone and uncramped, and have a little privacy to myself.

      Hello? Hel...Hello? Is this thing on?  Hi, I'm Henry. I live in a smallish town of 25,000 on the central coast of Kalifornistan, that combines the problems of a city and the problems of a rural farm-town all into one horrible, crappy package . I like guns, knives, and other deadly weapons in general. Enjoy my future posts in this (we)blog.

      I am not very much religious at all- I am definitely not a member of an organized religion-I'm not really sure what I am. I don't know what I believe, or anything. Basically, in my opinion, religion is basically the quest for knowledge about what follows after death, and how to make life after death pleasant. There is more to it, but basically, that's all it boils down to. My problem with Christianity, Judiasm, and Islam is it's hard to believe that we only have one life to prove ourselves, and when we die, we are immediately sentenced to a wonderful bed of clouds where everything is perfect or a firey dungeon of pain for eternity. I just can't help but think there's much more to it than that. I do not consider myself an aethist, however, as I can't look at this vast universe and feel that there is nothing behind it. There must be a force or being behind this, life must have a meaning. I, and no person on this planet, for that matter, can know what ensues death. Perhaps we are reincarnated, perhaps we become another human being, perhaps something else happens. But I can not bring myself to believe that whether or not I swear too much, if I have sex before marriage or not, and whether I commit some other "sin" as defined by the church will decide my life for eternity. What do I think is "wrong"? I try to live my life on the basic principle that it is wrong harm someone or their property without good cause, and it is wrong to steal. I try to be kind to others, I try to be as peaceful and friendly as I can. I believe that if there is a God watching over us all, that is all he could want, is a loving soceity. I have trouble with the organized religions, as they promote the idea of God as being "love", but also preach about the "firey wrath and vengence" that he will strike down on us if we lead "sinful" lives. If there is a God as we know him, I truly believe that he does represent, or is love. If he is a vengeful tyrant, then well, it's a pretty dreary existence we have here. It's hard to think of what awaits us after our passing, but I believe, with all my heart, that it is not dull and dismal as some people would like me to believe. If there is a God, why would he focus on suppressing our natural instincts as human beings, especially if he created us this way, instead of simply promoting the idea of love, and unity between us all?   -Henry    "Sin lies only in hurting others unnecessarily. All other "sins" are invented nonsense." -Robert A. Heinlein

      I realize in my postings I've been a bit, err... high-strung. See, In reality, I'm not much like that, but I like trying to be different and offensive, to make a statement. I do not believe in political correctness, and I try to go in the exact opposite direction of it, as a way of fighting back. So, if you see me making some heated rant about something absolutely ridiculous, or you see one too many "fuck"s on this blog, just keep that in mind. Sorry if I offend anyone, but noone's forcing you to read this. And frankly, if you have a serious objection to "dirty words", I just can't really understand. I'm sorry, but in my view, they're just words, that I use to express my opinion. I am not offended by these words, I have no objection to using them. Again, I'm sorry if I'm offensive, but that's just the way things are, please keep the above in mind.  Thanks, Henry
