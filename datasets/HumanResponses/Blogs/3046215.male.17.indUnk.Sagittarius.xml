                         Rape Is America    America tries to stop terrism on our soil. A fat iodit love cake. A fat nerd loves computer. Brain dead is death, death is stupid. Cake is food, dirt in the mouth is cool. Sexing up trees is very, very funny. All men are human, not Black, Asian, White, Jew, or other. I may be fat, lazy, mean, stupid, or bald but I'm not fat. Why do so many people have the same name, are their parents iodits. Pigs can lie, but theifs can't steal. War is not funny, land mines are emm, evil. E3 2004 is going on and at the Nintendo Press Confrance they showed a new Zelda game. Not Wind Waker 2, a muture Link. I'm very happy.                       Thing I Don't Like:                    No.1 Matallica                   No.2 Land Mines                   No.3 Fat People                   No.4 T-T                    No.5 Evil People                   No.6 Whores                   No.7 Red Haired People             Tyler Derby and Chris Smurr

       Is Man Gods Trash?  Gum is all over the place. Under tables, under chairs, in hair, and on animals. Animals get hit by lightning. Lightning is attracted to steel. Steel is the reasource og Swords and daggers. Wars have changed over time, used to be with swords, arrows, and horses. Now with Guns, bullets, and tanks. Hetler thought jews were trash, Gods trash. Sadam and Bush think oil is God. Indians used every part of an animal for their own good. Is Man Gods trash. Evil needs to be stoped. Now smash a Hobo's face in with a fist. Buda needs to eat or he will die. Drink lot of beer because I said so.  Where Are You T-T?

       When A Blind Man Screams Does He Not Get Screamed Back At   Gone with the wind is not my favorite, you’re my favorite movie. Is T-T not gay, does not like it in prison.  "When will the wind blow. Does He not cry" . Just stop with the lam approach or cockroach. Leg of lamb is cool but hot when heated. When doves cry... Now I will tell you a story. About twenty minutes from now a door will slam shut. Frank O Bean is a not so average man. He smokes two packs a day. One hundred pounds over weight, and watches fifteen hours of television a day. Eats a McDonalds every hour. On the weekend He parties so hard he sweats blood. Frank always forgets the weekend because of drug, alcohol, and sex with women one hundred pound Heavier. Frank O Bean does not work. He does not have a home. The only way Frank watches TV is at Ratio Shack. Gets all his McDonalds through the trash.... Frank O Bean DIES two days later. The horrible end to an American hero.

       Worst Saturday Ever  Saturday I completed Zelda: The Wind Breaker." Worst Ending Ever " By the way I'd like to say thanks to my self for passing my 10th grade year. Hold for applause. I went to my Grandma's birthday party. At 5 o'clock I watched My nephew's basketball game. He won 17 to 0. After that I went to my parents friends party. Two girls ax me questions the whole time. I thought this one girl was my age but I was Four years older. Eat Barrel Donkey Kong.

               Chris Samurai said,"Tyler Derby prove to us your not gay and touch your girlfriends boobs in front of us?"  Queerish Tyler  just said nothing, and smiled, like a dumbass. Why du we do and say evil thing,  emm T-T !! How is Saddam doing, Probably dead. Growled a stupid dog," I don't know Davy . I'm just a stupid talking dog. Why don't I just die." Open wounds only hurt when butter is applied. Kill in your hippy Magnum PI to the C. You ever hear about people strapping bombs to their chest and blowing the hell up. Are they dumb or just fade to black. Blacker then night. Whiter then light. Yellower then the sun. Browner them Soil. Humanity is more indistinguishable then the real thing. Shut the funk up. Funk you, ditch. Father funker. I funking love you. Name the tune for the  Brady Bunch . Are hippys stupid or poor, lazy or homeless... Impulse Fiction(T-T Can't Get Laid)

      Funk opens the door, but vice destoys lives. The gateway is XYZ to the ABC. The fat man dies every time a McDonalds closes. Chris Smurr may be stupid, but Michael Anderson is a fool. El Carbaro is your fathers killers name. Now, avenge his death, little fella. Don't have sex with treeees, Knee. Don't kill me for I'm God. Open the door, fool!! Q9u7     Mr.T

              More and more people lie to themselfs. Like I'm not fat, Addicted, a falure, or not stupid.You really not need to do what they say. Everyone pushes each other around, like the gouvernment, friends, or even family. What I'm em trying to say is listen to your self and not others ya hear. Don't be a dumbass about it. Stop trying to be like everyone else. Stop smoking, start acting like Ringo Star. Next issue, Why does every take a low carb diet. It is not like who doesn't like energy. Let the Fat eat and be huge like a gummy bear. Let you fat be free. Tyler Derby is misunderstud. He lets everyone push him around, and call him gay. Tyler get a baseball and show everyone you are a man, bitch. He is not a queer he has a girlfriend and some people think she is hot. Will the drug flow ever stop?
