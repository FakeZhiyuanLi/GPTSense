      Lost. Thats where i am....  Where in my life can i find God? I've been pondering this for a long time, and somehow i get the feeing that i've not found him anywhere in my life at all. Looking back, i find my life is corrupted with sin, and the evils of sin still tempt me today, making it so difficult to love the people around me. Sucess, wealth, grades.... they have their value, on Earth, but not in heaven. To the rich man who asked "What must i do to inherit eternal life", Jesus replied, "&nbsp;Give away all your riches&nbsp;and come follow me". Indeed,&nbsp;i acknowledge that nothing&nbsp;bound on Earth can be taken to heaven. But then, i also realise that i've not done anything in my life out of the love Jesus has given to us.  I want to follow Jesus, but i just don't know how. I've stopped praying regularly and have even stopped being attentive at mass. Whats happening to me?   I'm like the lost sheep. Without my shepard, i fall prey easily to the snare of the fowler. My only hope now is that my shepard comes looking for me, and finds me. I want to return to prayer, to be in communion with Christ. And i know that so long as i repent, and follow my shepard home,&nbsp;He&nbsp;still has a place for me.  "He who has never loved, has never known God."

      I've become so uncertain about so much recently. About GP, about Chinese, about PW, even about whether i'm treating my friends the way they deserve to be treated. I've also realised how distant i've become from God. Right now, i feel perfectly fine, pretty happy in a&nbsp;way, but empty inside. That only tells me how temporary this pseudo-happiness is. I've become so drawn into the riches of this world, i've not stopped to consider whats really important for the next. Right now, i wish to return to prayer with God, to tell him how sorry i am for leaving his company, for not being a good neighbour, for not appreciating my friends, for not trusting in him, and for even allowing evil thoughts to corrupt me. Sadly, its not easy. I've apparently lost this love for prayer, and i've lost the will power to devote time to God. To my friends, though you may not know it, i've sinned against you in so many ways, in so many thoughts.&nbsp;Please forgive me, and pray for me, that i will return to prayer&nbsp;to seek the&nbsp;Lord, and&nbsp;to answer his&nbsp;voice....&nbsp;

      This week was killer, i ended up sleeping past 2 on tuesday, past 1 on wed, and past 2 on thursday again! What was the cause? PW...... Ultimately a big waste of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But crap, i want to do well for PW, so i guess i gotta work for it. I'm so not in the mood for work........ Can't believe it. On one hand, i'm glad Sat has come, but on the other hand, soon it'll be sunday, and then Monday would be coming round again......... I miss my&nbsp;BPS days so much, the sick humour, the teasing,&nbsp;the&nbsp;close company&nbsp;and most of all the carefree feeling. AJ is nothing compared to those days. &nbsp;

      God has indeed blessed me! Its just i never stopped to notice His works through the simplicity of everyday life!  Today, i got to know my GP marks. I had been so certain that i was going to fail. I barely knew what i was writing on that day, and i hadn't even planned my essay!!! In fact, if u ask me, i would say all i wrote was nonesense!!!  But to my surprise, i scored an A2!!!!! I couldn't believe it!!! In fact, i even told Mr Sakar that i didn't deserve the grade! I certainly must say, God has answered my prayer that day. I still remember vaugely how i prayed: " Lord, if it is your will that i fail my GP exam, give me the strength to accept it Lord. I do not blame you Lord, but i ask that You help me to continue placing my trust in you, and to continually thank You for everything You have given me!"  In a way, God has taught me so many lessons through this. Also, i learnt that God is always there, no matter what, i just never noticed....

      Today Miss Goh returned F-maths Paper 1, thus giving me my 1st ever  B  in my entire career as a Maths student. My heart just broke when i saw the 63%. I didn't have to console myself nor give myself excuses. Though the paper was tough and there was a major constraint on time (the entire level didn't finish the paper, not even the top student), i knew i had fallen short of my capabilities.  What was the cause? Complacency. Yes, i was too over-confident that i felt i didn't need to practice Differenciation and Parametric Eqns. The only Question i scored fully was 3D trigo, which was actually the only chapter i bothered to practice the night before. Despite the paper being difficult, i actually could do all the qns. But because of my lack of practice, i was unable to think through the qns quickly enough, and frequently got stuck due to careless mistakes. i have only myself to blame.  What made my day worse were the hurtful comments i recieved from people. Fine!!!! Shoot me with comments like "Don't be a jerk Chris, 3/4 of the level failed and you're mourning over your  B " ; " You are ****ing egoistic Chris. Stop acting, we all know you did well". They think i'm just ACTING disappointed to draw attention to myself!!!!!Fine!!!! Be happy with your  F  then!!!i know it looks good on you!!!!!!  Ppl don't understand that we all have different expectations of ourselves. They think that i have no right to be disappointed just because i did so much better than them!!! Why can't they be more understanding? I acknowledge that at times i am egoistic, and can be over-contented with my grades at times. But it only adds on to the disappointment when they say things like that when i'm already upset over it...

      I don't know whether to say today was fun or not.... Technically, there wasn't much we really did. The morning was rather wasted as Jon, Angie and I ended up going from place to place, only to realise that all the shops we were looking for were closed. We were quite BoLiao, as in, we ended up riding from Bishan to TP and back to Bishan. Other than a movie, nothing else was really accomplished(except maybe planning for Choir Outing). Speaking of accomplishments, sigh..there was just so much i could have accomplished during the holidays, but never did. I realised long ago there was no point looking forward to the end of Exams, as after that normal lessons resume and i'd end up dragging myself home at 8 plus again!!! Maybe its time i start planning my aims for the 2nd half of the year. I certainly hope i accomplish it this time.   Top 5 acadamic aims i wanna achieve from now  - Get my PW work spiffed up. I can't believe i put this off during the entire hols!!! Lazy me!!!! - Collect relevant PEARLS Points. I seriously hate the PEARLS system! Yet i have no choice but to submit to it... - Improve my Chinese. The Senior Minister once said that not everyone is cut out to be billingual. I'm gonna prove him wrong! - Improve my GP. Darn, i still can't get over the fact i screwed up my midyrs for GP!!! - Finish all my tutorials on time.(still got 1 Roots and 1 Vectors qn unsolved)    Top 5 personal aims i wanna achieve from now  - Lose weight. I think i'm getting fat, i seriously need to start working out. - Train my vocal range. I've yet to hit the high G. If i can't make it, i'm gonna be a screeching banshee when i do tenor. - To be on time. Could somebody tell me how many times i've been late already???? - Improve my piano and guitar. I still suck at sightreading, and my guitar pieces still sound horrible on recording. - Get Shao Wei (My student) to score 1 for his AMaths. If he does, i might get promoted.

      I feel so uncomfortable when ppl talk behind other ppl's backs. Why isn't it possible to just, tell them in the face what the problem is????  Each time i hear of this, it pains me knowing that out there, someone else could be talking behind my back, without me knowing, holding some sort of grudge or dislike towards me. At least if i knew what they had against me, i'd be able to change. But no, we humans would prefer to bad-mouth, and keep it from the person.I'd rather they just tell me straight in the face, and utterly destroy my self-esteem instead of keeping me in the dark, and allowing it to insidiously tear me apart. Yet then, i contradict myself by doing the same. A cowardly act of a wimp, one might say of me....

      I've been wondering for ages if there will ever be able to let this problem out of me! I can't stand it when i try to tell someone, and the person doesn't seem interested. I don't get pissed off with the person.Instead,i get pissed off with myself. It makes me become a victim of self-pity. Ah, self-pity,the most useless emotion in the world, yet at times i indulge in self-pity, thinking it'll make things better and ppl will take notice. Well, i'm a stupid fool everyday of the week, always bringing out this emotion, even now as i type this msg. Even worse is, i don't even know how to define my problem. It makes me feel even more that this is just an all act of self-pity. I can't stand the emotion, but i can't escape it, just can't escape it.....

      Self-pity. I encounter this emotion daily as well as have observed it in the people I know. At one glance, such an emotion seems harmless, but yet, this emotion, which so many have grown so comfortable with, is a sin that is one of the most difficult to overcome.  What is self-pity? I have asked myself this question and still have yet to find an answer i am satisfied with. Generally, when we indulge in self-pity, we choose to think that we are the victims of our problems. We then want people to see us in the same way, as victims. We start to enjoy people's concern, and just can't seem to get enough of it. We want people to continue to see us as troubled, in need of concern, and overwhelmed with problems, and to acknowledge it openly to us. We start to abuse the good intentions of those who are really concerned, by making them more worried about us...  Soon after, we start to create problems for ourselves. Every single thing that upsets us becomes a reason to fall ill with depression. We enjoy the concern people show us so much that everyday we choose to be in such a state. Instead of getting better, we convince ourselves that we're worse. We become masters of reciting our woes... Eventually, to justify ourselves that we are really in such a lowly state, we tend to remark about how much we hate ourselves, how we are overwhelmed with problems, how inferior we are, how insignificant we are, how incapable we are, how depressed we are....  The reason self-pity is a sin is because it is directly opposite to the Gospel's teachings of self-denial. Self-pity is self-centered in nature, as such emotion focuses on only the individual. Self-denial completely discards the individual, and in self-denial, the focus is on others, not on oneself. Jesus spoke that "if anyone wishes to follow me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me." Also, self-pity keeps us from seeing the needs of others. In all that we've come to understand, we believe that only our problems matter, and those who really need our concern, our healing touch, become secondary to us.  Yet there is nothing wrong with wanting to share problems, and opening up our unhappiness to others. The difference between opening up ourselves to someone, and self-pity, is the respect and appreciation you have for the person's concern. Self-pity yields no appreciation, nor any form of gratitude.  However, it is not the end of the road for those who are ensnared by self-pity. Self-pity by itself is a choice one makes, and hence all it takes is the decision to come out of it. Before healing the paralysed man, Jesus asked him, "Do you want to get well?". Jesus is telling us we have to make that choice. After that, Jesus says, "Get up, pick up your bed, and walk." In other words, we need to take decisive action to overcome this self-pity, and to do something about it.  I believe i can end my indulgence in self-pity, but the struggles in faith every now and then have certainly made it seem very difficult. I still need God to help me in overcoming all of this, and i pray that He'll be there to tend to my needs.  " O God, forgive me for being so self-centered, for wallowing myself in self-pity. You have given me so much, friends and family who care for me, yet I have convinced myself that their love is not enough, each time I choose to appear to them as a victim of sorrow. Lord, help me to remember that even if all the earthly love i have was spirited away, Lord, your Love will still remain, and that I can always rely on you Lord, to tend to my sorrow. Amen."

      I really owe Vaibhav a great deal of gratitude for pointing out to me how extremely inconsiderate i have been towards Vanessa and Nay Ling all this while.  I was too blind to notice that my actions have upset them. Indeed, my actions were dispicable, centred only at self-gain and nothing else.   Right from the start of PW, i've been making them upset with the things i say, and the way i choose to do things. It was all for a self-centered motive, that is, to get through PW as fast as possible and do well. To do that, my plot was basically to marginalise them, and leave the work to myself and Vaibhav, just because Vanessa and Nay Ling were not able to produce work as quality-based as us.  So i left them out of most of the time when it came to distributing the work. And not only that, i even remarked at times about their incompetency, in direct conversation with them. I wanted so badly to do well for PW without having to be bothered by incompetent members, that i failed to realise that i was being such a disgusting creature.  Eventually the group suffers. Miss Goh has placed a lot of negative comments in her report, about how divided our group is over the project, and about how there is no teamwork evident at all, and yes, its all because of my actions.   Even then, i still had the cheek to tell Nay Ling, "You need to speak up more during meetings, you and Vanessa are not contributing", as though it was their fault Miss Goh was disappointed with our group. She sure has got every right to be pissed with me.  Only today did i finally realise the impacts and consequences of my actions. It took Vaibhav to tell me straight in the face that i was being so utterly self-centered, that i was always being very unfair to Vanessa and Nay Ling, and how i had upset them through my words and actions, which reflected very well that i thought of them as obsolete and less capable. Vaibhav knew that i was only interested in points and grades, and that i was willing to compromise trust and consideration of others in getting it. What he said that struck me the most however, was that all i was interested in was points,when it should actually be about thrust, not about points. I realised then that this was true. I had been self-centered and thought only of Points, and bothered myself at all with Vanessa and Nay Ling.   I owe Vanessa and Nay Ling a really serious apology, not just for screwing up the project, but for hurting them. I also do owe Vaibhav a big thank you for finally bringing me out of this self-centeredness of mine. He has certainly opened my eyes to see the sin i have indulged in, and what he said has somehow made me a little wiser....

      Its become really difficult for me to be truly sincere about my prayers to God. I've realised long ago that prayer is more than just words, its more than just about petitions and a listing of intentions. Prayer requires a heart, and without that heart, prayer by itself has no meaning. I've been praying for an intention for the past two years or so, but i've realised that everytime, i've only suceeded at listing the intention before God. I've not put any real meaning into it. My faltering faith isn't enough to actually sustain it. Perhaps that is why i haven't seen God tend to it. I ask that God, in his mercy and saving grace, will so generously grant me that faith i need to go back to him, back to prayer and communion with him.  "God, please forgive me for not praying with a heart, for treating you as a servant each time i leave my unhappiness before you, with the mentality that you are obliged to turn them into joy. I ask that you Lord, give me the faith i need to serve you in everyway i can, and that i will see you Jesus, in every person whom i know. Amen."

      Today was a new experience for me, and a very memorable one indeed. I've always known that my singing wasn't that great, and that I've always lacked the enthusiasm and intensity, but well, i just love singing, and that was why i actually decided to get a group of ppl who were as enthu about it as me to sing for our birthday girl.  Initially the plan was for me to duet with Angela, on a Whole New World. It was the initial idea until the Wednesday before, when i realised i couldn't get a pianist to accompany it. That very day, i phoned Jonathan to ask him, "um...do you think you could learn a piano piece in just 4 days?" and he was like, "What!? you kidding?" But somehow i had still convinced him to try. On saturday, Jon and Angie came over to my place to see if it was possible to piece the song together, and guess what, after the whole thing it was still in pieces. I had to become the pianist at the last minute, and Jon was left to struggle with Aladdin's tenor part. Later, Jonathan remembered he had so coincidentally been playing a Chinese song that was perfect for Alethea. And since i was her Chinese student, it was even more appropriate that i should sing to her in Chinese! The song (If i understand the words correctly), is about a person who's looking back in life, and expressing how meaningful her Grandmother's words were as projected in her daily life. Later, Daniel and Brennan joined in, and they had the perfect chance to learn Stay The Same, at the last minute, in fact, the last hour, an hour before we left for Alethea's place on Sunday. The experience of singing for someone just to show how much you appreciate the person can be really frightening. Basically, the fear is that you'll screw up (which i did), and that it will degrade the sincerity of the whole thing. I felt that somehow, if it wasn't perfect, it would be more of an insult rather than a strong sign of appreciation. I don't know if the rest felt the same way, but i know that Jonathan was desperately trying to relieve the tension by shaking it out, while Angela looked so calm it was frightening. Well, i'm glad that Alethea appreciated our effort a lot, and that she didn't mind us not doing a perfect job.I still however, would have liked it to be perfect. As what i was later told, maybe i am a perfectionist. Perhaps what this experience has taught me is that "you can do so much without doing it right, but yet with the right heart, itself is already perfection."
