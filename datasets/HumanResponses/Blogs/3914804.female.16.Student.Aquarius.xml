      Getting quite addicted to writing these damn things, god knows why as so far they are boring as hell!!  Speaking of addiction, it's a funny thing, eh? (perhaps not if you're a recovering alcoholic, etcetera, but you get what I mean...) My addictions include: Texting, eating vast quantities of icecream&strawberries, listening to music, speaking 2 people, reading, etcetera etcetera.   Addiction- i define it as needing something, and suffering from some sort of withdrawal symptoms if you are deprived of it (and yes, I get that with all of the above!!) My small banana-covered dictionary (I'm damned if I'm disturbing the precariously balanced books in my smallest bookcase to get the huge one out...) defines addiction as "the condition of being abnormally dependent on some habit." Excuse me -   abnormally??   I may be abnormal in many ways, but i defend the rights of addicts everywhere (at least, those whose habits do not excessively cause harm to others!! Like smokers    So must go, STILL got some packing to do!

      Anyone who has not heard the song "Play Me" by Neil Diamond should make sure that they do. In my opinion it is v v good!!  Alternating between Neil Diamond, Dean Martin, Doo Wop, Bob Dylan, Elvis, Maroon 5, Scissor Sisters and Daniel Bedingfield at the moment. Cesca says tis&nbsp;a strange habit that I have developed, saying what music (or mucis as Sloth would say...) I am listening to. Well... I am a strange person!! heehee.  Donchya hate it when you write a blog then discover u'v made an&nbsp;error, whole editing process, ARGH...  Hey Mr Tambourine Man...    ANYWAY. Off 2 Shrewsbury for a week tomorro, having evaded the family holiday, which luckily Mum has accepted as not being a personal insult. Just couldn't take the arguments right now- my brother, believe it or not, has reached new levels of obnoxiousness. I know sibling troubles are present in every family, and the youngest is always a pain when growing up, but I don't think anyone could understand how bad he is unless they tried living with him. Honestly, he's a monster. Excrutiating pain to Miles indeed. For some reason no-one can grasp, he apparently weed on the outside wall yesterday, so now no-one can go outside til it's been hosed down and disinfected. I swear, he's a fricking lunatic, I don't know how that happened, being part of OUR family...  Kentucky Woman...  Well STILL haven't packed, which can't be good, as I am going tomorrow &nbsp;:-0&nbsp;&nbsp; Even my parents have packed and they're not going til Saturday. Oh dear. But I do so hate 2 pack... Packing is for wonderfully organised, capable and laid back people, such as Caroline. Messy, disorganised, stressy people like myself should never be allowed near a suitcase, or bag of any kind... Perhaps I should be kept in a padded cell!!! Or not... Mite be a tad boring.  Paddocks, I've always thought that was a nice word, but having said which I must go, until l8r- tea calls.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       Thought I'd try a different font for a change... I love fiddling with fonts, and if there's one complaint I have with these blogs it's that there's very little choice of font and they're all boring!!   &nbsp;  Anyway...  &nbsp;  King Arthur! Happens to be one of my favourite legends (although I prefer still more the way the Pythons take it off in The Holy Grail, sooo funny... The intelligent, political proletariat - "Hey, we're a democracy [or whatever they said!] Just cause some watery tart handed you a sword..." heehee! Going off on a bit off a tangent there but that's what Monty Python does to you... Lot of ellipses today. Anyway, how DARE they use this legend as ANOTHER film made purely to carry Keira Knightley!? If you've seen Pirates of the Carribbean - which had the one redeeming quality of a wonderful, hilarious, eyeliner (but not lipgloss!:-( ) wearing Johnny Depp (actually that one redeeming feature led me 2 c the film more times than I'd care to admit...) who looked particularly excellent contrasted against the wooden "acting" (pah!!!) of Orlando Bloom  , and Keira Knightley, whose acting "talent" seems to consist of pouting when scared, pouting when angry, pouting when in luurve, etcetera, you'll know what I'm talking about.  &nbsp;  Bit of a rant there, tis true...  &nbsp;  Been on a long, long walk with my silliest dog and my mum, my feet are blistered!!  &nbsp;  Must go, tea awaits on the table... May write again later on my return, but for now, adieu!

          I hear you scream.        &nbsp;   For instance, one of my friends goes on and off guys - well, celebrities&nbsp;- every five minutes. One minute she's ranting about Duncan from Blue (yes did i mention she also has bad taste in men!!) and the next, she's certain that she and some footballer Christiano or sumthing are meant 4 each other.        &nbsp;   My friend whom i have been talking to is fickle withr real life guys. Cesca and I have observed the way she flirts like hell with one guy, then loses him as soon as she is sure of his liking her&nbsp; - the thrill seems 2 be in the chase. With my open mind as ever,&nbsp;(again, ha!) I must add, well, each to their own. However, when the "hobby" affects and hurts others, I object.   &nbsp;   Anyway enough of my ranting on that topic - I'll rant on another instead!!   &nbsp;   Having just returned from the doctor's I am not in such an amazing mood as now at cesca's next week I will have&nbsp;2 take 5 tablets&nbsp;a day, all @ different times :-( not fun.       &nbsp;   ah well better go I'm getting a headache and my fickle "friend" has gone.       &nbsp;   Farewell til once again I grow bored...

         Lunchtime blogging, what a giveaway to the sad state of affairs today! Having watched 2 dvds already today i am loath 2 watch another, so instead I am writing this while listening to my mother and brother play table tennis and make odd comments to one another.         &nbsp;     Anyone seen Withnail and I? "The fuckers will rue the day!!" "I'm going to pull your head off... No, please don't pull my head off. I'm going to pull your head off, cos i don't like your head!"         &nbsp;     If anyone reads this who HASN'T seen Withnail and I, they're going to think ... well... strange thoughts!!         &nbsp;     Apparently it's a very cult film, and apparently people see if they can drink whatever Withnail and "I" drink throughout the film... As vast quantities of alcohol and paraffin are included, i would think that would kill them, but ya know, I'm open minded(ha)each 2 their own eh?!           &nbsp;     Due to the hurtful insults regarding my colour scheme, I have revised it, and as I am currently writing in pale blue which I can't c on white bckground, i hope that i make no errors and also that this extreme sacrifice is duly appreciated! Heehee.         &nbsp;     Always looks a bit moronic when people write heeeeeeeeheeee, which I FREQUENTLY do in online conversations and my blog, but one has 2 express laughter somehow!! and it's better than the inane repetition of the word "lol" which sends angry shivers down my spine...         &nbsp;     My brother is driving me craaaaaaazy - and i was pretty mad 2 start off with...         &nbsp;     Soon the grief that is packing will once again be upon me, and as I have often bored dom by telling him, I CANNOT PACK!!!!!!!!!!! For one night away from home I pack a week's worth, how much am I going to pack for a week?!?! Harder 2 pack for a friend's house when u will b going out, than 4 a holiday, as when u go out on holiday no1 u kno is ther! (OH apart from mum dad and siblings... but they don't count.)         &nbsp;     West Wing, more people should be granted access to it. Now it is shown only on E4 and my parents won't get Sky cos my mum hates rupert murdoch...         &nbsp;     The air is turned blue with cussing as Muffin bites Miles' toe... mwahahaha!         &nbsp;     And again, as Miles loses 2 points in a row to mum...         &nbsp;     Honestly, the influences that surround me, it's a wonder I turned out to be the miracle I did! heehee j/k!         &nbsp;     Stand up comedy takes much bravery, and it's disillusioning when you find out the whole thing is not, in fact, improvised, but memorised :-( . Eddie Izzard and Robin Williams , also Ricky Gervais.&nbsp; Eddie Izzard's first girlfriend was the current girlfriend of my new English teacher'. Wow an incredible link 2 fame... It reminds me of Caroline,&nbsp;Cesca and Naomi's major thing for the great (yeah right) Justin Timberlake, so conventional! heehee.&nbsp;Every day Caroline would come in with a new "link" that somehow, eventually, linked her to Justin Timberlake. Usually&nbsp;theu went along these kind of lines: "Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;my sister's boyfriend's dad's borther's friend is a bodyguard of 50 Cent, who knew Jennifer Lopez, who's a pop diva like Britney, who dated Justin..." You get the picture!         &nbsp;     Muffin having a crazy spell again, better go...............         &nbsp;     over and out!

        Right - I am NOT going on holiday, it's official - Cesca has said i can stay at her house for&nbsp;a week!!! So kind. It'll be like a wicked recurring sleepover!       &nbsp;   Yay!       &nbsp;   Did not post last nite as spent "Internet time" talkin 2 Cesca and Seb, ah well. As nobody reads this, I'm sure there will be little disappointment!! Besides, I needed the&nbsp;conversation.&nbsp;To date, only Cesca, Dom and Seb are able 2 make me laugh out loud online! An impressive feat indeed.&nbsp;(You will note I am limiting myself to  less than 5 exclamation marks,  thus rendering critics unable 2 acuse me of insanity - merely eccentricity!       &nbsp;   It'll be an uneventful day, as I am tired; however, I have promised my obnoxious brother to take him 2 the tennis courts later today,         &nbsp;   May I just recommend white grape and ederflower Schloer which Cesca introduced me 2? It's very yummy!       &nbsp;   It occurs to me that when one is young, there is the inclination to wish away your life, thinking it will improve with age. But when you pass a certain age - perhaps 20s? - you wish yourself back in time (not 2 your teenage years however, 4 obvious reasons!!)       &nbsp;   Must dash, parents need phoneline. Tara!

      Good TV is a rare commodity  and should be treasured.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; DVDs and videos are safer - you know, and in fact choose, what you're in for. But how depressing is it to see open mouthed braindeads gaping at a screen all day, watching anything and everything regardless of quality or even whether or not the programmes interest them? I put forward my brother as a "perfect" example of this sad state. He watches gardening programmes, crappy soaps (well they all are) and gameshows, etcetera etcetera etcetera. Ah that reminds me of (the original) The King and I, that was so good if only for the incredible dresses which I would kill to wear, the soundtrack, the hilarious King, the cute kids...ok actually that's quite a lot!!! Those dresses though... Amazing... Yeah I know corsets were awful&nbsp;&amp; everything, but I often think that the style of that day, corseted or uncorseted, would've suited me much better than the modern day dress! It covered&nbsp;legs completely, etcetera!&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad's playing&nbsp; records, I'm makin him pick out a good selection though, 60s stuff&amp;rock 'n' roll, none of his danceband crap!!     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buddy Holly now!     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of my friends have gone out 2 the Vaults or somethin 2nite, I went last week though and as the venue is ABSOLUTE CRAP (unless your idea of fun is being eyed up by REALLY drunk, REALLY pervy old men...) I declined this time! (also hardly anyone's going, nobody I am desperate 2 c right now.)     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder how many people wish they were someone else. I have to say, I never do. This is my trick. Although I have quite low self esteem, there are a couple ( and i mean, a couple) of things I like about myself (and thyr all but one "inner" things, trust me!). So when I feel really depressed i usually end up thinkin, would i wanna b "whoever" if it meant not having those things? And cause you're accustomed to having these few good qualities, u realise u can't say "yes". (I don't "plan" to use this "technique", i'm not a complete wanker, it's just the way my mind happens to work!)     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm hoping no1 reads my blogs, as I'm coming across as a bit of a twat really, but never mind.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel horribly bloated having eaten like a pig all day, makes me feel sick. Like Christmas when you eat WAY past your comfortzone limit, cuz it's CHRISTMAS&nbsp; for goodness' sake, and the food is good, but you end up unable to imagine ever feeling hunger ever again (it passes with time - certainly in time for next Christmas!!) Not that anyone wants 2 know, but this feeling is much more acute when u'v been being sick non-stop for 2 days (allergy 2 tablets was taking)       &nbsp;   ANYWAY       &nbsp;   better go my darling brother has politely (yeah rite!!) asked if i wish 2 partake in a game of table tennis.       &nbsp;   L8rs!     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Thought I'd do another entry as everyone on my MSN just buggered/buggerred/how DO you spell that?? off leaving me with no-one to talk to but my blog! :'-( Also, 2 entries - pathetic! It needs padding out a bit...  So - Daniel Bedingfield. Pity he has 2 be creepily and scarily religious and immature. Who would have thought it? I spent whole minutes of my life thinking about how great he is, only to be disillusioned by my dream of perfection... I don't intend to detract from his talent in any way - listening to the album right now and I defy anyone 2 say it is not BRILLIANTLY IMPECCABLE IN EVERY WAY, (can't WAIT til the new one), but how can such an amazing songwriter/singer be so immature and - well before i say this, let me say i have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING against religion in any shape or form other than FANATICAL. Anything fanatical is scary and fanatical religion has caused so much strife. Not that I'm suggesting Daniel's religion is leading him to being the next Cromwell-mentality or terrorist, etcetera, but he is scarily religion-obsessed, and as for immaturity, I lost respect at the last concert when he said, "I'm speaking to the bloke with the bum fluff [beird] on his face" - riiiiight. Niiice.  Having said which, "If You're Not The One" is the best song to be released this century.  Moving on  Looks like I'm off 2 Yorkshire after all - here are my choices:  1) Stay with a friend for an entire week 2) Going (obviously) 3) Mum staying with me and everyone giving me hell about having ruined their holiday.  Great.  So I'll go and make their lives hell mwahahahahaha!!!!  Dad appears 2 have lost the train tickets anyway (100s of pounds worth) so naturally everyone thinks i am the culprit - riiight - thy'll probably just buy new 1s. Idiots.  Friends. The word instantly conjures up images of that great tv prog we all know and love, bt i was actually on about ... well... actual friends. Fascinating eh. I wonder how many others classify/categorise their friends, subconsciously or otherwise. There's the conventional ones:  Best friend Good friends Acquaintances etcetera  Then we add our own.  Useful friends Weird friends Notfriend friends! etcetera  Yeah I'm babbling/talking random crap as per usual ignore me    Everyone should read Pride&Prejudice. Really. It's great. NO-ONE SHOULD READ THOMAS HARDY UNLESS THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO GET SUICIDALLY DEPRESSED!!   My dog Kiri is a sweetheart - Muffin is a knobhead. I'm sorry but he is! Very handsome dog, but no brains...  Other knobheads include Mr Ashley my old (OLD!!!!AS IN NO LONGER YESYESYESYESYES!!!) physics teacher - cesca caz nay jade etcetera will remember the avoidance and windup tactics, alison jade caroline and klara will remember the pidgeon reincarnation episode - or maybe they won't! teehee.  The Shrek2 website ( urlLink  ) sucks dudes, it really does. It's slow and boring.  hehee if u look up "Bethany Golding" on  urlLink   , (which u do if ur really sad like me!!!)(oh and if u hav my name) there are 2 actual references 2 me!!      urlLink   and www.leemac.freeserve.co.uk/answers3.htm  anyways...  Table tennis.

      Title quoted from poem by Stevie Smith, just thought it was a pretty apt description of how I felt this morning! Much better now thou :-) , sadly it took only a gorgeous new bra and a good day of writing at work experience 2 temporarily lift me from my "abject misery"! (Shallow, moi?!)  This morning I hit my parents with the news - I fully intend to stay behind when they depart for "our" holiday in Yorkshire (always fun 2 go somewhere even rainier for your summer holiday!). Even the offer of a free-rein cost-wise trip to Leeds (trust me, GOOD shopping) could not lure me. Holidays, cooped up with my brother and the inevitable increased level of family argument, is not something I feel up to coping with right now, 2 be honest - I'm not feeling v on top of things right now. In fact, I'm very much below them! A week alone at home (actually I've never been "home alone" for more than a day b4) sounded like the perfect tonic for my current hellish mood. Peace, silence, tranquillity (I like 2 use several words 2gether meaning more or less the same thing)... Freedom 2 read, listen 2 music, watch TV/DVDs etcetera, without constant interruption. Heaven....  UNFORTUNATELY, the parents take a different view... "You're in no state to look after yourself" "What about the house? You haven't shown yourself to be responsible enough to take care of it." (No, Mum, that's right. My irresponsibility in occasionally getting home late or losing stuff will naturally, in due course, lead me to burning down the house...) etcetera etcetera you get the picture.  Listening 2 Elvis, ah how I love old rock 'n' roll!   Anyway , hope i can persuade them. At the moment they are saying a firm and definite no. I can stay at a friend's for a week, if i must, but not sty home. Dad even threatened 2 cancel the holiday altogether if i don't go. Yeah I bet that's what they'll do, and then make me feel like shit about ruining their holiday. Yippee!  Moving on...  Wish I could sleep, the ability seems to have left me, odd that. They want me 2 go on some kinda pills or something but guess how sick i am of pills? Very. Literally... The metefanamic acid made me v sick indeed!  "I caught this morning morning's minion, king- dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and  striding High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing In his ecstacy! then off, off forth on swing, As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding Stirred for a bird, - the achieve of, the mastery of the thing!  Brute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion Times told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!  No wonder of it: sheer plod makes plough down sillion Shine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear, Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermilion."  That is my favourite poem of the moment. It is SO DAMN GOOD it sends shivers down my spine! If we had studied poetry like THAT at school more people would have enjoyed it. Not many more, cuz as far as I can make out most people have very little interest in English, but some! Instead of "cultural poetry". Riight. Crappy poetry more like. Well not all of it but most.  Gonna go for now, might post again later if i'm bored

        Well well. It seems I join the bloggers, having grown bored pretty rapidly of my AOL journal. Such is life, as I am wont to say.  Anyone sick - and i mean   sick - of LOTR fans, Orlando fans, Elijah fans, fans in general??? Staunch fans drive me crazy. What's with the freakin obsessional qualities, guys? G . E . T . A . L . I . F . E. thankyou. Celebritymania = same theory  Anyway, I am BORED. Parents out, house 2 self (which is incidentally WASTED completely, because every1 i know (barring 2) is on holiday   anyway. Ah the woe and misery of it all.  Boredom is a funny state of affairs (that's funny-odd as oppose 2 funny-haha). You'd think there were enough activities in the world 2 keep one busy, but i like 2 have the odd rebellion against LackOfBoredom, u know? Well u prbably don't as I haven't gotta clue what I'm on about!!!   Actually i've been memorising poetry - I caught this morning morning's minion... etcetera, don't ask me why, I guess I just felt like it.  I wonder what makes people do these things? A need 2 express themselves? Boredom? In my case I suppose it's a combo of boredom and another factor, which is that I love 2 write, I also love 2 type. About anything really. As long as nothing 2 icky like maths or physics comes onto the agenda! eeew.  I am starving, without parents I tend  2 forget about food if otherwise occupied. Til my stomach reminds me!  Just downloaded this thing called trillian (www.trillian.com) which is like msn messenger, aol messenger, yahoo, blahdyablah etc messenger all rolled into 1. pretty handy huh? yeah i'm BOOOOOORED!!!  Dogs r barking SHUUUUUUUUUUUUT UP DUDDDDDDES!  Argh I need human conversation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  eeeeeeeurgh caught a glance of physics separate sci revision bk. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!  Anyone tried chocolate crepes they're v yummy but only available from tesco and france apparently.  Can't wait til college it's gonna b so much fun (I hope you're listening, college, I don't want 2 be disillusioned!) had die bester Zeit (sick of crappy english superlatives), everyone was lovely , die Lehrer und Lehrerinnen waren wunderbar, especially my Law+History teacher who is v v intellectual! But fun! And swears a lot always good. We call the teachers by their first names, odd! No more uniform!!!!!!! Freedom 2 express!  Will miss me ol' buds thou :'-( but am already planning mucho visito to shrewsbury2 c them! (funded by EMA allowance and parents) I can visit on Wednesday afternoons off and weekends when the need takes me.  Better go the Family eill b back soon, the only "humans" I don't want contact with rite now.   l8rs

      What I find deeply disturbing atm is that in a month, I have written more blogs than people who have been on this thing for a year. Shocking eh. Scary for me... I think the reasons for this travesty being:  1) Whenever I begin something, which is very rare, I enter it with a passion and go to extremes (yep that's right, even online blogs...) 2) Evidently, I have too much free time on my hands, this being the summer holiday 3) I talk a lot and have far too much random and boring crap to say...  Btw, I take thos oppurtunity to DEFEND NEIL DIAMOND, who has been defined as crappy old music and an old geyser by a charming friend of mine... OK, whatever you think of the man, (I don't like *him* for goodness' sake), the following songs are, in my humble opinion, excellent:   Play Me  (  HAS   to be a classic I   LOVE   it)  Kentucky Woman   Solitary Man   I'm A Believer   Shilo   Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon     Give it a chance, eh? At least listen with an open mind before coming out with judgemental inadvised crap...

       Eddie Izzard... So damn funny people! Watch! Ah stand up comedy I love it so.      Sourcery by TP is having another re-read (courtesy of me...) good ol' Rincewind a model coward!!      Didn't go out in the end, but what canye do. Actually twas a blessing in disguise, as was unaware that parents *secret* underlying reason for wanting me out of the house is that they (along with obnoxious bro) to the cinema in Ludlow tonight, and were afraid I'd trash the house if left alone... mwahaha....      So now, have the house to myself, many new dvds to watch, buckets of Ben&Jerrys (parents' guilt trip...), galaxy minstrels and some rather entertaining photos!!!       Speaking of which better get back to them before the family gets back, bye!!

        Hehehe have discovered the huge font option... ! I think my mum's having a funny turn, she has decided it is obligatory for me to go out tonight, as she loves my new hairstyle (which will only last a day) and top. She is craaazy and evidently having one of her funny turns...           The hairstyle is rather odd, kind of 70s style (although I'm sure I can brush it out with ease), and although the top is fairly pretty and in a style I like, I wouldn't really attribute it with magical compulsory going out qualities, but still...          On the one hand, she has offered to pay for my travel and anything else I may want to do while I'm there (I *told* you she's having a funny turn, there's my proof...)           But on the other hand, I have nowhere to go, nothing to do and a feeling of lethargy. Hm.          Ah well I'll probably give it a miss, especially as I can't just force myself on Jade as I would in such circumstances normally, being as she has graced the seaside town of Borth with her presence.          The dogs sit around moping and sometimes I feel obliged to mimic!           Enough about boring personal dilemmas. WATCH FRASIER. WATCH ALL OF FRASIER. ALSO WEST WING. This order has been brought on by my mum's recent purchase of season 2 of the former and season 3 of the latter on dvd, SO DAMN WATCHABLE IT'S CRAZY. Wit and cutting dialogue, so rare it should be treasured like platinum...          Eurgh my goddam hair's too bouncy!!!          Better go before it knocks me out...

       "Hard to have faith, ain't it, when you've read too many books?"    Granny Weatherwax, Carpe Jugulum, Terry Pratchett       I'm in a quoting mood today.  Odd that now I come to think of it both of the last two have been about a lack of faith. Probably due to my brief sojourn at Lucy's house...  I got a postcard from my old French teacher today, which upset me really as French lessons were the main reason I   didn't   want to leave the high school. Sounds odd I know, but for me they incorporated the things I will most miss: being part of a group that has existed for so long everyone is completely comfortable with it; being a dominant member of that group (which I mainly experienced in French as my two friends who tend to drown everybody else out weren't in it); feeling intelligent for once in my life and enjoying working as a team with Cesca (hehe we made such a good pairing in French!!) oh i could go on but I've written so much today, it being that time of the month when i get weepy and over emotional and lethargic.  Sometimes you just want to put every aspect of your life on pause and take some time out to think without being plagued by splitting headaches! Everything just seems a bit messy at the moment... Ah well such is life I suppose.

       My friend has just got MSN Messenger, and disturbingly, her screennames so far have been "Mrs N Ronaldo" and "Ronnie's Girl". She is in love with Christiano Ronaldo, a Portugese footballer, and has just sent me a whole bumper bundle of photos of him (my lucky day eh?!) crying like a baby, exposing his thighs, etcetera etcetera. Deeply, deeply disturbing - as you will well know if you have ever seen/ seen/heard an interview with this guy...      Anyway in other pressing news, If You're Not The One, or IYNTO if you are a hardcore fan of the song, remains one of my all time favourites, although I have ended one of many "crushes" as they are apt to be called, due to the fact I can no longer overlook the fact that he is a scary religious fanatic and deeply immature... However, he does write  bloody good  songs. If you like the romantic and varied types. And he is very good live, I'm seeing him for the third time soon...     Anyway.  I need pizza. Now. Starving. Miles has eaten everything else in the house...        Our revels now are ended. These our actors.      As I foretold you, were all spirits and     Are melted into air, into thin air:     And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,     The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,     The solemn temples, the great globe itself,     Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve     And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,     Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff     As dreams are made on, and our little life     Is rounded with a sleep.    William Shakespeare       Incredibly depressing but poignant I think.          Hm.          Concerts concerts concerts galore am most happy!!! Maroon5, Scissor Sisters AND Daniel, YAYAYAYAYAAY! (Explicable happiness today folks!) So goooood i loooooove concerts.....          god have the mother of headaches.          Daniel's new album's out soon .          FOOD. NEED. FOOD. AM JUST RAMBLING HERE ...          o pizza's ready tara!

      TRAVESTY=remixes of decent songs, gr   BLINKING PARENTS=Well, go figure...      UNEXPECTED HAPPINESS=Well firstly, my younger brother has been banned from the computer - *yes*!... Second, inexplicably happy despite the above criteria of travesty and blinking parents...      So YAY! will revel for a second... there I'm done!      Ate too much methinkses ouch.      Life takes EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND BUSTED PISS OFF NOOOOOOOOW HOW DID THEY GET ONTO THIS CD??????!!!!!!!!!!!!! funny twists and turns eh? Eurgh another terrible song...      Films! I *love* films! Let's have a tribute to films...   "I thought that was one," I hear you say.  "That was the beginnings, an introduction, :P," I reply...  Films are easier than books in a way, easier to digest with minimum effort, except the ones requiring awesome amounts of concentration in order to just remember where the hell you are in the film (a prime example being "Eternal Sunshine Of the Spotless Mind", which is AMAZING, but hops around in time all the time, sehr confusing...) . However, do  not , by all means, believe that by this I am "dissing" books, I love them also. It's just that this is my  film  tribute, not my  book  tribute you idiots!! :P  . Book tribute comes in a later blog!  Black and white films  - well, not  all  of them obviously, but the  good  ones - are a blessing, and those of you who "despise" black and white films as a group, without even having  seen  any of them, can bugger off quite frankly!!!  OK, I must cut off my film tribute prematurely to describe a song by Stacie Orrico that just came on (listening to a freaky compilation cd I bought cos I can't be bothered to leave the room and find some decent music...  The chorous goes "There's gotta be more to life, than chasing down every temporary high, to satisfy me......" etcetera etcetera etcetera (watch The King And I!) which mildly interested me as it brought back echoes of the messages gleaned from books like "Brave New World."  anyway must go, later!

       Tis a cd by Bryan Ferry which few-none have heard! Probably because it's in the bizarre section of even my mum's collection... tis ver' good though!      In other news... YAY, I am *finally* getting a decent double bed! Yay!!!      Masquerade. Rubbish song...      Life is like a coincidental jumble of events that appear to make sense, but don't...

       Just a quickie, as am leaving the house soon. Just thought I'd comment on how *amazing* Billy Joel's songs are, I love them, I really do, and had forgotten how much until I discovered the cd just now.       Talking to an old friend - one of my oldest - online, constantly perplexed as to whether or not we get on. ??? Odd situation.      In other news, I *really* need to go on a diet, but I just can't be bothered!! No willpower...       Ah well...      Listening to "modern woman" by Bill Joel now.      Don't really know why I'm babbling on 2 be completely honest, better bugger off and catch the train...      later!

       Have just been reminded by Naomi that I am going to college next year. Hard to forget, you may think... meh.       I'm really looking forward to it, have already made some friends - and one of my best friends, Alison, is coming with me. So I'm not nervous. In addition to which I *love* the teachers already.My French teacher is both humorous (although not as incredibly entertaining as Madame Beattie (sob!) and clever. She is very encouraging and I enjoyed her practice lesson. My History and Law teacher is incredibly intelligent, shares all my political views and is very funny. (He looks like a cross between Daniel Bedingfield and Mr Brown!! hehe.) My English teacher is silly but ok!      *However*, despite its rather disturbingly snobby and stupid headmistress (at least Miss Gardener was an *intellectual* as oppose to financial, etc snob)and its obnoxious maths department (BITCH BITCH BITCH... SORRY), I'll really miss SHS. My History, French&German teachers were some of the nicest, most entertaining and intelligent people I have met. My friends have afforded me millions of hilarious and wonderful memories, and although I am very irritable and genuinely *like* only a selected few of them at a time, they have all contributed! hehe you can see how pompous and weird I get when I get nostalgic - you should see the Leavers' books!!... However, at least I don't have to get nostlagic over Saturday nights out, as I fully intend to continue to *be* at them.... mwahaha they cannot be rid of me !!!!      Anyway, after that immensely boring litany (I'm bored and only have two rather reticent people 2 talk 2 ok?!) I'll depart...

       Ah, good, loud music, and what can beat it we ask ourselves? Not much, although I *can* think of a few.   Anyway...  Parents are having a bit of a freakout with me, never fun, while my baby brother (ha!) is in the foullest and most grotesque mood known to man...  Ah well, /ignore mayhem around self! hehe.  Stayed at Chris' house then Alison's house recently, which was ver' fun, and we saw Spiderman 2, which I deeply recommend to those underprivileged souls who have not yet seen it. Also walked through a thunderstorm, and that, also, is most sincerely recommended (apart from lightning risks of course...) Got soaked to the skin and arrived back at Christina's with our clothes apparently glued to our skin!! Hehe twas ver' amusing though!  Queen off now, listening to "Shout!" by the Isley Brothers. ver' good!  Anyway, intended to write something deep, philisophical and totally unconnected to my boring life, but cannae... brain *appears* (:p now you just look stupid!) to have fried, so bye!

      Just saw Shrek 2 again, it's so damn good! I love it when they do "Holding Out For A Hero" at the end, I want the soundtrack... although in fact I *do* have the original version by Bonnie Tyler, which I'm listening 2 right now... Not many cds our family doesn't have between us!!  Puss In Boots is so damn cool, I love Antonio Banderas (and his wonderful voice) anyway, and tis a marvellous part! Just a pity he has 2 be an animated cat instead of his usual self *sigh* hehe!! But the cat is *great*!  Wearing my new top, tis ver' nice if a bit over-revealing, methinks for home use only! Got 2 start reading "The Poisonwood Bible"....  Can't seem 2 sleep anymore, tis ver' bizarre.... Ah well, *such is life*. Was up til 5am this morning, tis nicht so gut. /Me yawns!  Ever heard Genesis? No probably not... /damn my varied and unrecognised musical tastes!!  Damn this infernal icecream, etcetera, my diet has flown away on the wind... ah screw it.  Bttr go ... purely because i can't think of anything to say   [first time this has ever occurred in my lifetime]
