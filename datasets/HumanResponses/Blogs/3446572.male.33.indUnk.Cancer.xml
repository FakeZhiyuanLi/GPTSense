      Time magazine is reporting something we pretty much already knew: that Dick Cheney, who served as Halliburton's CEO until leaving the company in 2000 to accept the Republican VP nomination,  urlLink played a key role  in sending a multi-billion dollar government contract to his "former" company.  A March 5, 2003 e-mail from an Army Corps of Engineers official mentions that Cheney, who  urlLink still draws a paycheck from Halliburton , coordinated the contract, which Halliburton won three days later; this was no huge surprise, since no other bids had been submitted.  Cheney's involvement in steering government contracts to Halliburton flies in the face of his earlier claims:   "As vice president, I have absolutely no influence of, involvement of, knowledge of in any way, shape or form of contracts led by the Corps of Engineers or anybody else in the federal government," Cheney told NBC's "Meet the Press" in September, Time said.    So now, in our nightmarish 1970's flashback, we have US troops immersed in an unpopular war that continues to degenerate into a quagmire, runaway oil prices, a VP who is doing his best impersonation of Spiro Agnew, and  urlLink Chicago is touring with Earth, Wind and Fire .  Wouldn't it be nice to find out that Bush has a secret taping system in the Oval Office?

        From an email I received recently:    Once, I was a happy woman.  I was a mother. I had two wonderful children who knew how to behave themselves: Constance and Aaron.  I was a wife. My husband, Christian, was a good solid man I could count on.  That was just a few months ago. How could we have known, back then, that our blissful family would soon be torn apart forever by the forces of Satan?  Oh, as I look back on it now, I can see that there were signs, like when Mr. Penderglass down the street started wearing teal, or when attendance at the Boy Scouts pack meeting started going down, or when Father Hanlon, who holds mass down at the All Souls Grace Blessing Rosary of Our Lady of the Aching Lower Back Cathedral started a midnight solo boy's glee club, with rehearsals in room 204 at the Motel Six. At the time, of course, I just thought it was God working in mysterious ways.  If I had to choose one moment when my denial finally started to crumble, it would be the time when I found a smudge of bright red lipstick on the front pocket of Christian's best short-sleeved white wrinkle-free Sunday dress shirt. You see, every night when Christian comes home from work, I greet him at the door with a nice kiss on the cheek. The thing is, I only wear purple shades of lipstick, ranging from a light violet to a medium mauve. A few years ago, the Mary Kay representative on my block let me know, confidentially, that anything outside of this color range would be considered indiscreet, given my complexion. I don't even own any red lipstick. Too much red can give men the wrong idea.  Well, I was pretty upset seeing that red lipstick on my husband's collar. I confronted Christian that very evening, right after I kissed him at the door and brought him his evening glass of beer.  He didn't deny anything. He told me that had spent the afternoon in an alley, french kissing a woman named Tanya he had met in a tavern, after getting drunk on Schlitz malt liquor using money he had withdrawn from our children's college fund.  When I demanded an explanation, he looked at me with a confused expression on his face and asked me, "Haven't you heard that the Supreme Court in Massachusetts has said that it's legal for gay couples to get married?"  Suddenly, everything became clear.  I ran across the living room and fell into the Lazy Boy where Christian was sitting, and threw my arms around him. "Oh, you poor baby," I cried. "You must feel awful! Why didn't you just call me to let me know?"  Christian gazed deeply into my teary eyes. "What's the point of being honest with each other anymore, honey, now that gays can get married in Massachusetts?"  "Do you mean to say..."  "Darling, let's admit it. Our marriage is over."  To hear these words from my husband was a difficult thing. The more I thought about it, though, the more I realized that I just didn't care about him anymore, now that gay people were going to be getting married. The love was gone, thanks to that damn homosexual agenda.  I was about to ask Christian if he would like to experiment with some non-traditional lifestyle choices when I heard the front door opening. It was the kids coming home from school! How would we break it to them?  Aaron set down his backpack to kiss me on the cheek. He was wearing a navy blue blazer with a matching tie, ornamented only with an American flag lapel pin. "Gosh mom," he said as he passed us by on the way to change into his Eagle Scout uniform, "what a long day at school! Still, I know that the Lord wants us to study hard so that we can read the Bible."  As Constance walked into the kitchen, her ankle-length grey flannel skirt brushed up against Christian's wrist, and I saw his cheeks grow red. "Hey, honey," he leaned over to whisper, "Now that we're going to get a divorce, do you mind if I ask Constance to go out with me to the drive-in tonight? I promise I won't go past third base until she's ready."  What the hell, I thought. Sure, she's our daughter, but now that gays are going to be allowed to get marriage licenses in downtown Boston, all concepts of morality are destroyed, and it doesn't really make a difference anymore. I wondered to myself which of my neighbors' houses would be the easiest to break into - I needed a cup of sugar.  Constance turned on the radio in the kitchen to the Christian AM station we always listen to, and that's when our family's fate was finally sealed. The Lord's news update was saying that gay people in San Francisco were being allowed to get married right then and there!  Constance turned around suddenly, with a strange look on her face that I had never seen before. All of a sudden, she started running towards the front door, ripping off her clothes. The last I saw of her, she was skipping down the street, wearing nothing but a flower in her hair, screaming, "I'm sexually promiscuous now! Does anyone want to have some casual sex so that I can get a sexually transmitted disease and then have an abortion?"  Aaron came downstairs with a hurt and confused look on his face. "Golly," he whispered to Christian, "do you think that Constance has been influenced by the 1960s culture of permissiveness?"  Christian frowned and said, "Son, all that you need to know that gay people are getting married in San Francisco."  Immediately, Aaron ripped the merit badges from his uniform and threw them on the floor. "Fucking shit, Mom," he said to me. "I guess I'd better drop out of school and join a gang of juvenile delinquents."  "Okay," I said, feeling all my parental authority melting away, "But try to be home before midnight. We'll be getting Cinemax now, and I'll bet there will be a really sexy and violent movie on after prime time. Maybe we can even illegally record it on our VCR."  Aaron told me to shut up, then burped and walked out the door.  Christian and I sighed. It was hard to say goodbye to him, but I knew the time had come. The homosexual agenda had succeeded in destroying our family, even though we had been happy, secure, and God-fearing just a few hours before.  Who knows what will happen next? I suppose that as the news of gay marriages in San Francisco spreads, everybody in town will be getting divorced.  I'm not sure where I'll end up, of course, but I'm taking my first steps in this new world shaped by homosexuality. I suppose I'll have to become a lesbian now. I've put in a call to the local Lions Club asking if they know about where I can get in touch with a baby-killing satanic cult in our area, and I've cancelled the check I wrote last week to the Christian Coalition.  To think that it all could have been different, if gay people had just left well enough alone and not wanted to get married.

      We already knew that Bush's Folly, aka the war in Iraq, was costing this country dearly by draining money away from domestic priorities and distracting our attention from other pressing national security issues, such as the real war on terrorism.  Now the Pentagon is reporting that while Nero... uh, I mean Bush, is fiddling around in Iraq, China is aggressively  urlLink expanding its military capabilities  and is poised to emerge as a superpower in the next few years:   China is pursuing a "comprehensive, well-planned, well-executed transformation" of all sectors -- including weapons, tactics, doctrine and training -- and could be a world class military force in 10 to 15 years, the official said.   This is coupled with China's growing economic power, increasingly confident role in world affairs and expanded involvement with other Asian militaries, the report noted.    The Chinese are building their military with the obvious goal of reunifying Taiwan with the mainland, by force if necessary.  But with about 20% of the world's population and a rapidly growing economy, who's to say they'll stop there?  Is there anyone out there left who seriously believes that Bush is going to be better for national security over the long term than Kerry?  In just 3 1/2 years, Bush has allowed 9/11 to happen on his watch, gotten us bogged down in a costly, misguided and unnecessary war in Iraq without any real support from the international community and with no exit strategy in sight, and now he's dropping the ball with China.  We really can't afford four more years of this incompetence.

      A mere two days after I signed a new 13-month renewal lease for my apartment, my roof is leaking in my living room.  Well, actually it would be more appropriate to say that my wall is leaking - it rained really hard over here tonight, and it looks like the hard rain seeped into a crack along the side of my apartment facing north, where the wind and rain were coming from.  I have no idea what will need to be done in order to fix this, but I have nightmare images of sheet rock being torn out and replaced, not to mention whatever the hell they have to do to plug up the outside wall of my apartment.  So how was your Thursday?

      Hoping to come up with more money for Bush's war in Iraq and tax breaks for his rich buddies, administration goons have told officials who oversee federal education, domestic security, veterans and other programs to prepare preliminary proposals for the 2006 budget process that would  urlLink slash spending  in those areas after the presidential election.  According to White House documents, the programs facing reductions if the smirking chimp pulls off a repeat screwjob this November include the EPA (2.6% cut), National Institues of Health (2.1% cut), Homeland Security Department (3% cut), Education (2.4% cut), and Veterans Affairs (3.4% cut).  Meanwhile, the Defense Department would see a 5.2 percent increase in its spending, the Justice Department would get an extra 4.3 percent, and rich fuckers like Kenneth Lay would get to keep their tax breaks.  Yep, that's compassionate conservatism for ya...

      Just a few months after an  urlLink American Airlines pilot  spooked his passengers by asking Christians on his flight to identify themselves and begin proselytizing the flight's non-Christians, two Pentecostal preachers, Canadian nationals Yohan Heenatigala and Komal Singh, succeeded in  urlLink grounding a Continental Airlines flight  leaving Buffalo, New York, after they frightened people by declaring the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were a "good reason to pray":   One preacher told fellow passengers as the Continental Airlines plane taxied down the runway, "Your last breath on earth is the first one in heaven as long as you are born again and have Jesus in your heart," according to FBI spokesman Paul Moskal.    Moskal added that "[i]n the context of 9/11 it may not have been the best way to promote their religion."  Gee, ya don't think?  I'm beginning to see a very disturbing trend here, though.  I came across a story about another recent flight that was " urlLink hijacked " by fundies, and I'm beginning to wonder if the religious right hasn't come up with a new invasive tactic in their ongoing quest to assimilate nonbelievers.  Talk about a captive audience - it's not like you can slam the door in their face, or leave.  Yet another reason to  urlLink go Greyhound ...

      Yes, for some reason I've decided to jump into the water and start my own online journal.  As for what I hope to accomplish with this little enterprise... well, that's a good question.  Those of you who know me are well aware of my desire to be a professional writer someday, and this venue offers me the opportunity to practice my craft in a place where people will be able to read and evaluate my work.  You're also undoubtedly aware of my political leanings, and the chance to have a soapbox to stand atop and scream my opinions at virtual passers-by was attractive, too.  But I don't want this blog to be just another vapid attempt at would-be punditry, especially since there are so many Instapundit wannabes already out there.  I would like this journal to be a broad reflection of who I am, and of what piques my interest.  So if you like what you've seen so far, don't be a stranger: come back, and bring friends.  I will continue to post about current events and offer my take on them, probably at greater length as I get better at this.  If you don't like what you've seen thus far... well, come back anyway.  It'll get better, and it won't always revolve around politics and news, I promise!  I might even post some of my creative writing up here at some point.  And feel free to leave your feedback as well - I don't want this to be a one-way exchange.  I can't promise that I will always respond to your remarks, but I can say that I will try, and I can also say that I will read them and thus benefit from them, regardless of whether your comments are flattering or constructively critical.  Above all, I hope that you enjoy your visits here and that you get something of significance from them.

      While compassionate conservatives in Florida were busy  urlLink helping a convicted child rapist end his suffering , not-so-compassionate conservatives in the Asscroft "Justice" Department were busy trying to prevent doctors in Oregon from helping terminally ill patients end their suffering.  Fortunately, the Ninth Circuit Court of of Appeals  urlLink dealt Herr Asscroft and company a stinging rebuke , ruling in a split decision that the Justice Department did not have the power to punish Oregon doctors for lawfully assisting their patients with suicide under the state's Death With Dignity Act, which was passed in a 1994 statewide referendum.  The majority decision had some especially pointed things to say about Asscroft, chastising him for overstepping his authority in his attempts to block the state law:   "The attorney general's unilateral attempt to regulate general medical practices historically entrusted to state lawmakers," Judge Richard C. Tallman wrote for the majority, "interferes with the democratic debate about physician-assisted suicide and far exceeds the scope of his authority under federal law."   The delicious irony in this case is that Asscroft, who represents the same group of people that for years have been using the idea of state's rights as a sledgehammer to try and chip away at abortion rights for women and voting rights for African-Americans, is being slapped down for subverting the idea of state's rights in an area where it rightfully applies.   "The principle that state governments bear the primary responsibility for evaluating physician-assisted suicide follows from our concept of federalism, which requires that state lawmakers, not the federal government, are the primary regulators of professional medical conduct," Judge Tallman wrote.   Asscroft and the rest of the Bush administration have proven that they will stop at nothing, including backtracking on their historic attachment to state's rights and subverting the will of the voters, in pushing their fundamentalist agenda.  Fortunately, the Ninth Circuit is having none of it, and neither are the people of Oregon, especially those for whom the Death With Dignity Act was passed.   "The main thing is that the people of Oregon made a decision through the democratic process," said Don James, 78, a Portland man who is dying of cancer. "I don't know yet if I will personally take advantage of it," Mr. James said of the law, noting that his prostate cancer has spread to his bones and causes him considerable pain. "But I want the option."

      Never let it be said that those compassionate conservatives down in Florida aren't sensitive to the wishes of those who want to end their suffering through assisted suicide.  Tonight the state  urlLink executed John Blackwelder , a 49-year-old sex offender who strangled a fellow prisoner so he could get the death penalty rather than serving the life-without-parole sentence he got for raping a 10-year-old boy:   [Blackwelder] said he wanted to die but could not bring himself to commit suicide and that he strangled Wigley in order to force the state to execute him.  Blackwelder pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and told the judge at his sentencing hearing that if returned to prison he would kill "as many times as necessary" to be put to death.  "I'm stuck in prison the rest of my life. There's no way of getting out. I'm not being in there. I can't handle it," Blackwelder told the judge.   [...]   Death penalty opponents said executing Blackwell would send a dangerous message to all prisoners serving life sentences.  "The message goes out to every lifer in the state," said Abe Bonowitz, executive director of Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. "If you don't like your life in prison, kill a prison worker or kill a fellow inmate and the state will assist in your suicide."

      Arkansas uberbreeder Michelle Duggar is all smiles after  urlLink delivering her 15th child , and she's apparently not through yet, either:   The baby’s father, former state legislator Jim Bob Duggar, sounded a bit tired but happy after returning home Monday. He said his wife and new son were doing fine. He said he leaves the decision up to Michelle on whether to have more children.  “I have always left it up to Michelle because she’s actually the one that carries them and does all the labor,” he said. “But we both love children. Even yesterday, she said she would like to have some more.”   Mother and child are said to be doing well, although Michelle reported feeling some discomfort because the birth was her second by Caesarean section.  Of course, that discomfort might also have something to do with the tattered remains of her uterus dragging the ground as she walks.  And talk about reinforcing stereotypes - they're from Arkansas, the dad's name is Jim Bob, and they're still raring to breed even with 15 kids.  These people are a double-wide trailer and a pair of dueling banjoes away from being inducted into the White Trash Hall of Fame...
