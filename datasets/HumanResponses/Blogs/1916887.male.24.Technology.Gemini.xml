      Attention Info Addicts:  RSS is a great thing.  It stands for many things, but in my world, RSS stands for only one: bringing information to my desktop.  It's like having a program that continually hits news websites for new headlines, security sites for new advisories, blogs for new postings, etc, and placing all of the new information into one simple program, ready of you to digest.  Personally I get the latest advisories, news, tech news, tech blogs, and even info on hockey all in one place - reducing the need to hit 20 or 30 websites every 30 minutes to stay on top of the game.  Here's a few links you'll need to get started:  Recommended Reader:    urlLink Wildgrape NewsDesk  - this free program is fast and easy.  The only gripe I have about it is that all of a sudden it seems to want to crash on my work pc (probably a .Net issue).  Other than that, it runs great on my home box and lets me quickly stay informed.  Where to look for RSS feeds:   urlLink djeaux :: RSS newsfeeds  - Has a short listing of Security-related newsfeeds.   urlLink NewsIsFree  - an insane database full of news feeds for many different subjects.   urlLink Blogstreet  - Lists blogs with RSS feeds.  A helpful article:   urlLink Blogs: Another Tool in the Security Pro's Toolkit

      This is an interesting passage from theInquirer.net:  "The notion of copyright infringement as theft was clearly addressed in the 1985 Supreme Court decision of Dowling v. United States. While this case involved hard goods (phonograph records), Justice Harry Blackmun was most certainly speaking of abstract property (copyrights) when he wrote these words in his majority decision overturning Dowling's conviction of interstate transport of stolen property: '(copyright infringement) does not easily equate with theft, conversion, or fraud... The infringer invades a statutorily defined province guaranteed to the copyright holder alone. But he does not  assume physical control over copyright; nor does he wholly deprive its owner of its use.'"  This is the article:   urlLink RIAA collects fines, doesn't pay artists   This is hilarious:  urlLink User Friendly Amnesty Form   And also this:  urlLink Accounting for 12-year old Brianna LaHara's Settlement by the RIAA.

      As an Admin, sometimes you find the need to use the built-in MS Backup utility.  Here's a quick syntax summary:   urlLink JSI Tip 4113. More on Windows 2000 backup command-line switches. : "Windows 2000 backup command-line switches."  Syntax ntbackup backup [systemstate] "bks file name" /j {"job name"} [/p {"pool name"}] [/g {"guid name"}] [/t { "tape name"}] [/n {"media name"}] [/f {"file name"}] [/d {"set description"}] [/ds {"server name"}] [/is {"server name"}] [/a] [/v:{yes|no}] [/r:{yes|no}] [/l:{f|s|n}] [/m {backup type}] [/rs:{yes|no}] [/hc:{on|off}] [/um] Parameters SWITCH DESCRIPTION  systemstate         Specifies that you want to back up the system state data. When you back up the system state data, all of the system state data is backed up, so the /s switch does not apply. Also, the backup type is forced to normal or copy.  bks file name Specifies the name of the backup selection file (.bks file) to be used for the backup operation. A backup selection file contains information on the files and folders that you have selected for backup. You have to create the file by using the graphical user interface (GUI) version of Backup.  /j {"job name"} Specifies the job name to be used in the log file. The job name usually describes the files and folders that you are backing up in the current backup job as well as the date and time at which you backed up the files.   /p {"pool name"} Specifies the media pool from which you want to use media. This is usually a subpool of the Backup media pool, such as 4mm DDS. If you select this, do not use the following switches: /a /g /f /t.   /g {"guid name"} Overwrites or appends to this tape. Do not use this switch in conjunction with /p.   /t{"tape name"} Overwrites or appends to this tape. Do not use this switch in conjunction with /p.   /n {"media name"} Specifies the new tape name. Do not use /a with this switch.   /f {"file name"} Logical disk path and file name. You cannot use the following switches with this switch: /p /g /t.   /d {"set description"} Specifies a label for each backup set.   /ds {"server name"} Backs up the directory service file for the specified Microsoft Exchange server. The /DS command line switches for NTBackup (with Exchange 5.5) no longer work with NTBackup for Exchange 2000. The Directory Store (DS) switch is not relevant since Exchange 2000 uses the Windows 2000 Active Directory. The Information Store (IS) switch does not apply since the structure of the Information Store has changed from Exchange 5.5  /is {"server name"} Backs up the Information Store file for the specified Exchange server. The /IS command line switches for NTBackup (with Exchange 5.5) no longer work with NTBackup for Exchange 2000. The Directory Store (DS) switch is not relevant since Exchange 2000 uses the Windows 2000 Active Directory. The Information Store (IS) switch does not apply since the structure of the Information Store has changed from Exchange 5.5  /a Performs an append operation. Either /g or /t must be used in conjunction with this switch. Do not use this switch in conjunction with /p.  /v:{yes|no} Verifies the data after the backup is complete.  /r:{yes|no} Restricts access to this tape for the owner or members of the Administrators group.  /l:{f|s|n} Specifies the type of log file: f=full, s=summary, n=none (with n, no log file is created).  /m {backup type} Specifies the backup type. It must be one of the following: normal, copy, differential, incremental, or daily.  /rs:{yes|no} Backs up the Removable Storage database.  /hc:{on|off} Uses hardware compression, if it is available, on the tape drive.  /um Finds the first available media, formats it, and uses it for the current backup operation. Use the /p switch to designate a device-type media pool when you use the /um switch so that Backup searches for the appropriate type of media, such as 4mm DDS. When you use the /um switch, Backup searches the following media pools for available media: Free pool, Import pool, Unrecognized pool, and Backup pool. When available media is found, the search stops and the media is formatted and then used without prompting you for input. This command is not applicable to tape loaders and you should only use it if you have a standalone tape device.

      Here's some interesting news:   urlLink Microsoft's SUS Website:  Software Update Services now provides Windows service packs (SPs), in addition to critical and security updates. SUS will deliver Windows XP SP1, Windows 2000 SP4, and all future service packs for Windows 2000, Windows XP, and the Windows Server™ 2003 family of products.  This will sure save some wear and tear on the shoes but trying to use this to deploy on a large number of hosts will not.  Some suggest to set up several SUS servers or to use GPO to control deployments.  For those of you who do not know about SUS, go here:  urlLink Software Update Services .  It is a free and easy way to provide critical updates and (now) service packs to your client pcs/servers instead of manually doing them or having your users go to Windows Update to patch themselves.  You also have the power to approve which updates are installed.  This website  urlLink SUSserver.com  is a great resource for SUS.

      I've seen several tips on freeing up CPU cycles by enacting this minor tweak.  Here's the how-to:  This excerpt from  urlLink Windows-Help.NET :   "To disable the Indexing service, open Computer Management from Administrative Tools (on the Start menu if you enabled this, or from the Control Panel), select Services and Applications, double click Services, and find the Indexing Service. Double click to bring up the Properties window, and click Stop to let Windows stop the service. Then from the Status type drop down box select Disabled. "

       urlLink MSBlast copycat set to pounce, firm says | CNET News.com   Here's even more warning to all of you out in SysAdminHell.  I've heard multiple sources say that it's only a matter of days before said worm is released, and it won't be pretty.    For those of you who don't like to patch, get your resumes ready.

      Ok guys.. I just received this email on the NTSysAdmin mailing list:       The PSS Security team is issuing this alert to advise customers that on Saturday 9/13/03 a research company called XXXXXX published a paper providing guidance on how to exploit the vulnerabilities patched by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-039.  To date we've had no reports of actual exploit code being publicly available or being used actively in a worm or virus     The paper makes it very simple to your 11 year old neighbor to write a worm with this exploit.      Patch your systems!!  Mine are all patched (as of today) so get busy.  Find out more about the  urlLink PSS Security Team .

      Here's a quick and easy way to gather information from Active Directory and import it into a spreadsheet:  Run Active Directory Users and Computers.  Select View -> Add/Remove Columns, and add the columns you want to display and export (e-mail address, last name, etc.).  Select the Users container or another organizational unit (OU) within your Active Directory hierarchy.  Right click on this same container/OU, select Export List and provide a path/filename.  Open up the exported text file with Microsoft Excel or another spreadsheet application.  You now have the information you need in spreadsheet format.

      Here's a good hint:   Enable Account Management Auditing   Sometimes you want to know what is going on w/ your Active Directory at all times (who wouldn't right?). User lockouts, creations, deletions, etc. To get these events into your event logs, you must enable the Audit account management policy for both success and failure. Here's how:   1. Log into your domain controller.  2. Select Domain Controller Security Policy under Administrative Tools in the start menu.  3. Find your way through security settings, local policies, audit policy.  4. Enable Audit Account Management for success and failure.  5. Done.   Look out for these events in your event logs (or use a filter program, such as EventSentry).   624 - user account creation  642 - user account changed  630 - user account deleted  628 - user account password set  627 - user account password attempt  644 - user account locked out  642 - user account changed: account disabled  645 - computer account created  647 - computer account deleted  635 - local group created  639 - local group changed  638 - local group deleted  631 - global group created  641 - global group changed  634 - global group deleted   Many thanks to  urlLink Windows & .Net Magazine  for publishing such a great article on this. If you don't regularly read this magazine, then you're no SysAdmin (well, in the Windows world at least).

      Hey kids.  INSTALL THE MS03-039 PATCH NOW!!!  This is no bloody joke.  Yesterday afternoon Microsoft had the nerve to disrupt my already busy day by releasing  urlLink Microsoft TechNet Security Bulletin MS03-039  which is yet ANOTHER hole in the RPC service.  Every single Windows NT kernel-based computer is affected (2k, NT, 2k3, XP).  Blaster 2 is only a matter of tweaking the original Blaster worm, so patch now.  I've been watching the lists and newsgroups closely (as well as my own installations) and haven't seen any issues with this patch as of yet.  It may also be of interest to grab the free Eeye RPC scanner  urlLink here  to get a good look at what's vulnerable on your networks.   Remember : Now that you know, it's up to you whether you spend a few hours and some reboots to patch now or spend a ton of time cleaning viruses later.

       urlLink Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-043  hole.  I suggest disabling the {useless} Messenging Service on all of your Windows devices to ward off this vuln and any future holes that may be found.  The easiest way to do this in an AD environment is to use Group Policy.  Here's the article:   urlLink Son of MSBlast on the way? | CNET News.com : "Released on a security mailing list earlier this week, the program takes advantage of a flaw in Microsoft's Messenger Service to cause Windows-based computers to crash. The vulnerability affects almost every current Microsoft Windows system, leaving security experts concerned that independent hackers will quickly find a way to take control of a large number of computers by exploiting the flaw. "  "I think we are going to see a repeat of the (MSBlast worm)," said Vincent Weafer, senior director of Symantec's antivirus research center, referring to the program that spread across the Internet in August. The program used a similarly widespread Windows flaw to break through computers' security. "It took three weeks (for hackers) to figure out a working worm in that case."

      For those of you that need to schedule defrag on Windows2000, take a look at  urlLink MorphaSys AutoDeFrag .  AutoDeFrag is a launcher for the standard defragmenter built into Windows 2000. The standard defragmenter does not support the ability to be scheduled, and therefore must be manually launched when required, once for each fixed disk in your system.  AutoDeFrag works around this limitation and allows the Windows 2000 Task Scheduler to be used to schedule the defragmenter.  AutoDeFrag is a tiny (~50k) Win32 console application that does not require any user input.  Just copy the .exe into a folder (like in \winnt) and schedule, or use the at command via command prompt.

      This is awesome!  SpamBayes is a free, open-source spam-killing plugin for Outlook and Outlook Express.  Using the superior Bayesian mathematical method and a self-training method, this program can achieve 99% spam blocking functionality within a week of use.  This is my spam solution, and it's worth a try.  A TechTV write-up on SpamBayes:  urlLink TechTV | SpamBayes: Spam Prevention With Smarts   Download the plugin here:   urlLink SpamBayes Outlook Addin   or here:   urlLink SpamBayes: Bayesian anti-spam classifier written in Python.   Quote from  urlLink spambayes.sourceforge.net :  SpamBayes will attempt to classify incoming email messages as 'spam', 'ham' (good, non-spam email) or 'unsure'. This means you can have spam or unsure messages automatically filed away in a different mail folder, where it won't interrupt your email reading. First SpamBayes must be trained by each user to identify spam and ham. Essentially, you show SpamBayes a pile of email that you like (ham) and a pile you don't like (spam). SpamBayes will then analyze the piles for clues as to what makes the spam and ham different. For example; different words, differences in the mailer headers and content style. The system then uses these clues to examine new messages.

      I know I went on and on about this exploit weeks ago, but this time it's a little different.  Here's a post from the  urlLink NTSysAdmin  list:    rpc-dcom2 exploitIt doesn't matter if your system is patched.  I tried this against a fully patched win2k and a fully patched XP system.  Both systems crashed or crucial operating system services crashed but explorer remained up.    Microsoft admits that WinXP SP1, even though patched, got exploited (but says that they haven't tested it on other platforms).  This is bad, really bad.  Here's a little help:   Snort signature:  alert TCP any any -> any 135 (msg:"RPC Vulnerability - bind initiation";sid:1; rev:1; content:"|05 00 0B 03 10 00 00 00 48 00 00 00 7F 00 00 00 D0 16 D0 16 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01 00 01 00 a0 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 C0 00 00 00 00 00 00 46 00 00 00 00 04 5D 88 8A EB 1C C9 11 9F E8 08 00 2B10 48 60 02 00 00 00|"; flow:to_server,established;classtype:attempted-admin;)  One suggestion would be to turn off these services and to block ports TCP 135, 139, 445 and 593; and UDP 135, 137, 138 and 445.  I urge caution before doing this; there are numerous programs/applications that rely on RPC/DCOM and these ports.  (Like a program called ScanRouter - which I had some rpc issues with over the weekend or  urlLink Veritas Netbackup ).

      "Late last week, Microsoft released a fix that addressed a way the flaw could be exploited but didn't fix the ADODB.Stream object itself, iDefense said in its advisory. 'I would not be surprised to see another wave of quiet, yet dangerous, Trojan attacks in light of this new exploit code,' Ken Dunham, iDefense's director of malicious code, said in the advisory.

Here's a quote:  "There are about 60,000 viruses known for Windows, 40 or so for the Macintosh, about 5 for commercial Unix versions, and perhaps 40 for Linux. Most of the Windows viruses are not important, but many hundreds have caused widespread damage. Two or three of the Macintosh viruses were widespread enough to be of importance. None of the Unix or Linux viruses became widespread - most were confined to the laboratory."   Check out this article, which is brought to you by  urlLink SecurityFocus .

       urlLink Pioneer Press | 10/03/2003 | : "Sen. Norm Coleman, two days after holding a high-profile hearing on the recording industry's anti-piracy campaign, said Thursday he will push legislation this year to reduce legal penalties for people who download copyrighted music off the Internet. Coleman, R-Minn., said current penalties, $750 to $150,000 per song downloaded, are excessive and enough to scare innocent people into settling lawsuits filed by the recording industry."  Coleman said he will also press for changes in federal law to curb the recording industry's subpoena power.

      A zero-day exploit targeting an Internet Explorer vulnerability (versions 5 and forward) is being used to install a Trojan. Experts warn that it's only a prelude to a series of attacks that are likely to wreck havoc given the number of unprotected systems.  "This zero-day exploit is huge. It will likely be a major, and highly successful, vector of attack upon thousands of computers for some time," says Ken Dunham, malicious code intelligence manager at iDEFENSE. "We have verified that attackers are installing backdoor Trojans and dialers on targeted computers at will."  "Multiple examples of the exploit code are available for attackers to analyze and use in crafting their own attack," adds Dunham. "This type of code availability and underground activity traditionally foreshadows a flurry of malicious attacks."  Microsoft first issued a patch for the 'object type' vulnerability on Aug. 20. The flaw allows an attacker to compromise a system by embedding malicious code in a Web page. If the Web page is viewed with a fully patched IE browser, the malicious code embedded in the Web page will execute. The 'object type' vulnerability patch doesn't prevent this variation of the flaw, but Microsoft plans to issue a fix shortly.  - From Security Wire Digest to subscribe, go to  urlLink http://infosecuritymag.bellevue.com

       urlLink New Windows Worm on the Way?   With the posting Wednesday of proof-of-concept exploit code for one of the newly discovered vulnerabilities in Windows, the familiar chain of events that often leads to the release of a worm has begun.  Less than 24 hours after Microsoft issued the fix, two members of the BugTraq security mailing list posted exploit code for the vulnerability. The author of one of the exploits said the code had been tested only on a Windows 2000 machine with Service Pack 4 installed and the FAT32 file system running. The other exploit is designed for machines running Windows XP. However, experts said it would take little effort to adapt the code for other Windows machines.   And, more importantly, the Workstation vulnerability appears to be a prime candidate for a worm

      Ok, ok, so this has NOTHING to do with Sysadmin issues.. but this is cool anyways.  I got this PS2 for my birthday last summer from a pawn shop.  My dvd player crapped out this month so I've decided to use the ps2 instead of buying a new one.  What's this?  Parental lock code?  Now I can't watch all of those R-rated movies I've invested so much in.  If you ever run into this problem, put in the dvd, reboot the ps2, and at the parental lock password screen press the select button and type in the code 7444 (this is the master code).  Now enter your own code.  Once the dvd starts, press the select button and choose setup.  Press right to go to the "region" menu and change "level" to off.  Parental lock bypassed.   urlLink Linux for PS2  - for those of you who just need a little more to the sysadmin side, this site helps you run linux on the ps2.

       urlLink Techweb > News > Windows Messenger Service security woes > Big New Chink Found In Windows Messenger Service > December 9, 2003  - According to analysis done by Symantec's DeepSight Threat Analyst Team, the Windows Messenger Service vulnerability can be exploited by a single UDP broadcast, allowing a wholesale compromise of all vulnerable systems on the targeted network.   “If I can exploit one single box on your network, I can exploit all of them,” Huger added.   “An application doesn't care about UDP,” said Huger. “It takes the packet, period, with no authentication.”   A worm just 2.7K in size would be enough to simultaneously infect up to 254 machines. Although that's larger than the minute 376 bytes used by SQLSlammer, “the difference is really trivial,” Huger said.   Not only might such a worm spread faster than Slammer, its damage could significantly outweigh Slammer's damage, for it would have a much greater number of potential targets. The Windows Messenger Service vulnerability exists not just in enterprise machines -- as with Slammer -- but also countless home computers running Windows.

The actual URL syntax in the link--which appears in the IE address bar when the link is clicked, and also at the bottom of the IE window when someone rolls over the link with the cursor--looks like this: http(s)://username:password@server/resource.ext. The browser uses whatever is to the right of the @ symbol to locate the Web page. Everything to the left of the @ is used to authenticate the user. If there is no authentication mechanism available on the targeted page, the beginning part of the URL is ignored. Attackers, then, can use the area to the left of the @ symbol to create a fake Web address and fool victims into going to a different page or site. For instance, the URL http://www.cnet.com@example.com looks like it will go to the Web site www.cnet.com, but it actually goes to http://example.com. "

The problem is that Internet Explorer can be tricked into opening a file, with a different application than indicated by the file extension. This can be done by embedding a CLSID in the file name. This could be exploited to trick users into opening "trusted" file types which are in fact malicious files.

Windows Memory Diagnostic is designed to be easy and fast. On most configurations, you can download the diagnostic, read the documentation, run the test and complete the first test pass in less than 30 minutes.  To run Windows Memory Diagnostic, you must reboot your computer with the disk or CD-ROM on which you installed Windows Memory Diagnostic in the drive. After the reboot, Windows Memory Diagnostic will load and its interface will appear. After loading, the first test pass will begin, using the default standard test suite, and continue until complete, unless Windows Memory Diagnostic is either paused or exited. Once the first test pass is complete, Windows Memory Diagnostic will begin a second test pass using the same settings as before. Windows Memory Diagnostic will continue to run test passes until you exit."

They have also refused to accept the GPL, claiming that some preposterous theory of theirs makes it invalid (and even unconstitutional)! Meanwhile they have distributed GPL-licensed Nmap in (at least) their 'Supplemental Open Source CD'. In response to these blatant violations, and in accordance with section 4 of the GPL, we hereby terminate SCO's rights to redistribute any versions of Nmap in any of their products, including (without limitation) OpenLinux, Skunkware, OpenServer, and UNIXWare.

Hooked it up to my workstation, and copied over a copy of the boot.ini file from another like-modeled laptop.  Within 20 minutes (including backing up the user's profile and researching the issue) the laptop was back in the user's hands.

       urlLink Code attacks Windows vulnerability | CNET News.com  - A piece of code that exploits a critical vulnerability that Microsoft issued a patch for only last week has been posted online, raising fears of an imminent MSBlast-style attack.   On Feb. 10, Microsoft released a patch that fixes a networking flaw affecting all Windows XP, NT, 2000 and Windows Server 2003 systems. The company warned people to patch their systems because the vulnerability could be exploited by virus and worm writers.   Four days after the patch was released, a piece of code was published on a French Web site that would let anyone exploit the vulnerability, meaning that unpatched customers could be hit with a worm similar to last summer's MSBlast, also known as Blaster.    *Note:* Everyone needs to patch as soon as possible but be careful;  I've heard mixed reviews about this one.. including domain controllers not booting or allowing anyone to log on after the patch has been applied.

The vulnerability is caused by an unchecked buffer in the Microsoft ASN.1 Library, which could result in a buffer overflow.  An attacker who successfully exploited this buffer overflow vulnerability could execute code with system privileges on an affected system. The attacker could then take any action on the system, including installing programs, viewing data, changing data, deleting data, or creating new accounts with full privileges.  Because ASN.1 is a standard for many applications and devices, there are many potential attack vectors. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must force a computer to decode malformed ASN.1 data. For example, when using authentication protocols based on ASN.1 it could be possible to construct a malformed authentication request that could expose this vulnerability.  Server systems are at greater risk than client computers because they are more likely to have a server process running that decodes ASN.1 data.  So basically, this is in *almost* every Windows system (not installed by default on WinNT), there is no workaround, there are a wide numbers of attack vectors (not like you could just block a port), and servers will most likely be hit easier than workstations.    Couple this with the IE update earlier this month (which breaks websites) and it looks like I'll have some overtime on my hands.  THANKS MICROSOFT!!!

       urlLink IE security patch nixes some apps | CNET News.com Some Web developers are complaining that an Internet Explorer patch that's meant to foil Net scams is disabling some applications that didn't put a premium on security. Microsoft last week announced that a modification to its IE browser would stop the insecure practice of including sensitive information in links. The update, which was released Monday, had some Web site programmers up in arms Wednesday due to complaints from Web users that they could no longer log in to sites that secure entry through credentials included in the URL. "Microsoft may have legitimate reasons for addressing the issue, but the way they addressed it--an across-the-board kill of an industry standard--is troublesome," said James Rosko, a software engineer for a data-processing service on the Web. He and other programmers spent Tuesday night making changes to the programs that process login requests for his company's Web site, which he requested not be named.  --- This *could* be a problem for some users who have to log into bank websites to do business.  Make sure you test this with your users before deploying.

       urlLink Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-004  - Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (832894) - Fixes 3 security issues, one of which is rated critical.  - A vulnerability that involves the cross-domain security model of Internet Explorer. The cross domain security model of Internet Explorer keeps windows of different domains from sharing information. This vulnerability could result in the execution of script in the Local Machine zone.   - A vulnerability that involves performing a drag-and-drop operation with function pointers during dynamic HTML (DHTML) events in Internet Explorer. This vulnerability could allow a file to be saved in a target location on the user's system if the user clicked a link. No dialog box would request that the user approve this download.   - A vulnerability that involves the incorrect parsing of URLs that contain special characters. When combined with a misuse of the basic authentication feature that has "username:password@" at the beginning of a URL, this vulnerability could result in a misrepresentation of the URL in the address bar of an Internet Explorer window.

       urlLink 287497 - How to Use the Inbox Repair Tools to Recover Messages  From  urlLink Lockergnome : The Inbox Repair Tool can be used to fix corrupt PST files and even OST files. Although the tool can be useful, it isn't always able to repair every PST file. It works by repairing the PST file's header and then deleting anything in the file that it doesn't understand. So if a PST file's header is damaged, as may be the case for corruption that occurs during a version upgrade of Office, the tool should have no trouble making the repair. But if the data within the file is corrupt, the Inbox Repair Tool will likely destroy what's left of the file. That's why it's always good to make a backup of the PST file before running the Inbox Repair Tool.

       urlLink Windows Update Services  - Read about the new and improved SUS.  Windows Update Services (WUS) is the new name for the next version of the update management solution currently known as Software Update Services (SUS). Windows Update Services will support updating Windows®, Office, SQL Server™, and other Microsoft products and will provide significantly expanded capabilities over SUS.  After reading the  urlLink WUS data sheet  I've found quite a few additions to the original SUS that I've been looking for in 3rd-party patch management tools:  1. Updates all MS products, as well as critical driver updates, non-critical updates, etc. 2. Ability to scan systems for missing patches. 3. Ability to uninstall updates, including group uninstall. 4. Target systems for update deployment. 5. Network optimization - BITS, MSI, download resumption, optimization for branch offices. 6. Status reports allow admins to easily determine update deployment status (success, failure, error, etc) 7. Allows extensive logging to SQL database. 8. Client  software will auto-update itself if necessary. 9. Can be deployed in a hierachial topology (parent/child servers). 10. Encrypts communications between WUS and the Microsoft Udate download servers as well as server-server and server-client communications. 11. Uses digital signatures to verify updates are from Microsoft. 12. Easier Admin interface - new design. 13. Group policy client configuration. 14. Ability to specify which updates get deployed on specifically targeted machines. 15. Allows for command-line and script-based control.  I'm hoping to get to play with this sometime soon (hurry and release a beta Microsoft!!).  WUS looks like it could kill the 3rd party solutions I was testing and all this for FREE!!  It looks like it has the best features from several 3rd party products I've seen - just hope it works as well as it looks.  Fuck SUS, go WUS!

       urlLink Symantec Security Response - W32.Sasser.B.Worm   urlLink PSS Security Response Team Alert - New Worm Sasser   The worm exploits the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) vulnerability fixed in Microsoft Security Update  urlLink MS04-011 (835732)  on April 13, 2004.  As of right now, there are 2 other variants of this worm.    A friend of mine called me from his job Sunday evening for help clearing it off of most of the computers in his department.  It's pretty nasty, seems to totally screw up the LSASS service. (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service provides an interface for managing local security, domain authentication, and Active Directory processes. It handles authentication for the client and for the server.)  He had issues opening programs (event viewer, msconfig, etc) because of authentication issues, the computer would reboot, safe mode would have issues, the cpu would max out..  Here are details from  urlLink Symantec:   1. Attempts to create a mutex called Jobaka3 and exits if the attempt fails. This ensures that no more than one instance of the worm can run on the computer at any time. 2. Copies itself as %Windir%\avserve2.exe. 3. Adds the value: "avserve2.exe"="%Windir%\avserve2.exe" to the registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run so that the worm runs when you start Windows. 4. Uses the AbortSystemShutdown API to hinder attempts to shut down or restart the computer. 5. Starts an FTP server on TCP port 5554. This server is used to spread the worm to other hosts. 6. Attempts to connect to randomly-generated IP addresses on TCP port 445. If a connection is made to a computer, the worm sends shellcode to that computer which may cause it to run a remote shell on TCP port 9996. The worm then uses the shell to cause the computer to connect back to the FTP server on port 5554 and retrieve a copy of the worm. This copy will have a name consisting of 4 or 5 digits followed by _up.exe (eg 74354_up.exe).

In simple terms, the link uses an unknown vulnerability to open up a local Explorer help file -- ms-its:C:\WINDOWS\Help\iexplore.chm::/iegetsrt.htm. It delays executing anything immediately but instead uses another unknown vulnerability to run another file which in turn runs some script. This script is then used to run more script. And finally that script is used to run an exploit that Microsoft Corp. has been aware of since August 2003 but hasn't patched.   That exploit -- Adodb.stream -- has not been viewed as particularly dangerous, since it only works when the file containing the code is present on the user's hard disk. The problem comes in the fact that the Help file initially opened is assumed to be safe since it is a local file and so has minimal security restrictions. "

       urlLink Ultr@VNC - Remote Control Software  - If I'm not mistaken, I've blogged about this before, but check out this tip:  If you want to get maximum refresh rate, responsivness and performances, you can try to completely disable "Hardware Acceleration" on the machines that run WinVNC. It can be done in "Display Properties" Panel - "Settings" Tab - "Advanced..." Button - "Troubleshooting" Tab - "Harware Acceleration" Tab set to "None". This makes a BIG difference, especially over LAN connections and even with others VNC distributions.WARNING: Turning off hardware acceleration with some ATI cards with result in BSODs under windows 2000. When you can turn it off however, the results are impressive. WARNING: This trick is pointless if the Video Hook Driver (W2000/XP) is used on the server.   Seriously, this tip works great.  I am dead-heading a test machine and I was finding the refresh to be extremely sluggish.  Now it seems quicker than if I was sitting at the machine itself!  Also, today's Black Tuesday (MS patch day).  They don't have the patches up on Technet yet, but expect some Direct X issues.. (rss is good).

This by-design functionality is sometimes used by web applications. However, when combined with known security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet Explorer, it could allow an internet web site to execute script from the Local Machine Zone (LMZ). This occurs because the ADODB.Stream object allows access to the hard drive when hosted within Internet Explorer."   urlLink 870669 - How to disable the ADODB.Stream object from Internet Explorer

       urlLink Yahoo! News - U.S. Steers Consumers Away From IE : "The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team touched off a storm this week when it recommended for security reasons using browsers other than Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer.   The Microsoft browser, the government warned, cannot protect against vulnerabilities in its Internet Information Services (IIS) 5 server programs, which a team of hackers allegedly based in Russia has exploited with a Java script that is appended to Web sites. "  Note:  Microsoft has claimed that those folks using XP SP2 are not affected by this issue.  I really do recommend installing the service pack, even if it's still in beta.  I've been using it both at home and work since it came out, and RC1 before that without any issues.  I have noticed no slowdowns, broken apps, etc.  It's like if Microsoft did something right!

      I know this is old news, since this is still being exploited...   urlLink eEye Digital Security - Vulnerability Management Solutions : "It has been discovered that an adware purveyor has leveraged two security flaws (one of which was previously undetected, a 'zero day') in Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser to surreptitiously install a toolbar on victims' computers that triggers pop-up ads.   One of the flaws lets an attacker run a program on a victim's machine, while the other enables malicious code to run with privileges higher than normally allowed. When combined, the two issues allow for the creation of a Web site that, when visited by victims can upload and install programs to the victim's computer."

(modified) Physical Address Extensions (PAE) mode is automatically set on if a) you are running WS2003 Enterprise or Datacenter Edition and b) your machine has more than 4Gb of physical RAM and c) your BIOS indicates that your machine supports hot pluggable memory. If your machine meets a) and b), but not c), you can add the /PAE switch in boot.ini to enable access to more than 4Gb of physical RAM. In all other cases the OS will not use more than 4Gb of physical RAM.

       urlLink A White Hat s Penetration Test : "By Mati Aharoni Contributing Writer Article Date: 2003-12-15 This tutorial is more of a 'case study', in which I describe a recent penetration test I performed. Due to the success of the penetration test (in a relatively very short time) I decided to share this experience with you."  This is a great walk through of the Chain of Events that lead a guy armed only with a domain name to gain admin control over a companie's mail server and network.  Great read.  {note: If anyone has any more "hack stories" like this, please send me an email (systemgod@gmail.com).  I love reading this type of thing.}

       urlLink NewsForge | Blackhat/Defcon: The final report : "The week-long Defcon 12 and Blackhat Briefings ended Sunday. Taking center stage in our final report are Google, a video history of bulletin board systems, a healthy dose of 'lessons not learned' by our federal bureaucracy, anarchy, and the threat of physical violence." - This is a great article by someone who was actually in attendance of both events.  Unfortunately, I was unable to attend Defcon due to family situation (kid) and financial restraints.  There's always next year!
