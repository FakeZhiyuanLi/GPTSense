             The 213 Things Skippy is No Longer Allowed to Do in  the U.S. Army       This list is among  the funniest things I have ever read. I don't know Skippy I am very sorry to  say. He is a friend of a co-worker who sent me this list, since Skippy's own  site is no longer online. Hope everybody enjoys!   Not allowed to  watch Southpark when I'm supposed to be working.  My proper military title  is 'Specialist Schwarz' not 'Princess Anastasia'.  Not allowed to threaten  anyone with black magic.  Not allowed to challenge anyone's disbelief of  black magic by asking for hair.  Not allowed to get silicone breast  implants.  Not allowed to play 'Pulp Fiction' with a suction-cup dart  pistol and any officer.  Not allowed to add 'In accordance with the  prophesy' to the end of answers I give to a question an officer asks  me.  Not allowed to add pictures of officers I don't like to War Criminal  posters.  Not allowed to title any product 'Get Over it'.  Not  allowed to purchase anyone's soul on Government time.  Not allowed to join  the communist party.  Not allowed to join any militia.  Not allowed  to form any militia.  Not allowed out of my office when the president  visited Sarajevo.  Not allowed to train adopted stray dogs to 'Sic  Brass!'  Must get a haircut even if it tampers with my 'Sampson like  powers'.  God may not contradict any of my orders.  May no longer  perform my now (in)famous 'Barbie Girl Dance' while on duty.  May not call  any officers immoral, untrustworthy, lying, slime, even if I'm  right.  Must not taunt the French any more.  Must attempt to not  antagonize SAS.  Must never call an SAS a 'Wanker'.  Must never ask  anyone who outranks me if they've been smoking crack.  Must not tell any  officer that I am smarter than they are, especially if it's true.  Never  confuse a Dutch soldier for a French one.  Never tell a German soldier  that 'We kicked your ass in World War 2!'  Don't tell Princess Di jokes in  front of the paras (British Airborne).  Don't take the batteries out of  the other soldiers alarm clocks (Even if they do hit snooze about forty  times).  The Irish MPs are not after 'Me frosted lucky charms'.  Not  allowed to wake an Non-Commissioned Officer by repeatedly banging on the head  with a bag of trash.  Not allowed to let sock puppets take responsibility  for any of my actions.  Not allowed to let sock puppets take command of my  post.  Not allowed to chew gum at formation, unless I brought enough for  everybody.  (Next day) Not allowed to chew gum at formation even if I  *did* bring enough for everybody.  Not allowed to sing 'High Speed Dirt'  by Megadeth during airborne operations. ('See the earth below/Soon to make a  crater/Blue sky, black death, I'm off to meet my maker')  Can't have  flashbacks to wars I was not in. (The Spanish-American War isn't  over).  Our medic is called 'Sgt Larwasa', not 'Dr. Feelgood'.  Our  supply Sgt is 'Sgt Watkins' not 'Sugar Daddy'.  Not allowed to ask for the  day off due to religious purposes, on the basis that the world is going to end,  more than once.  I do not have super-powers.  'Keep on Trucking' is  *not* a psychological warfare message.  Not allowed to attempt to appeal  to mankind's baser instincts in recruitment posters.  Camouflage body  paint is not a uniform.  I am not the atheist chaplain.  I am not  allowed to 'Go to Bragg boulevard and shake daddies little money maker for  twenties stuffed into my undies'.  I am not authorized to fire  officers.  I am not a citizen of Texas, and those other, forty-nine,  lesser states.  I may not use public masturbation as a tool to demonstrate  a flaw in a command decision.  Not allowed to trade military equipment for  'magic beans'.  Not allowed to sell magic beans during duty  hours.  Not allowed to quote 'Dr Seuss' on military operations.  Not  allowed to yell 'Take that Cobra' at the rifle range.  Not allowed to  quote 'Full Metal Jacket ' at the rifle range.  'Napalm sticks to kids' is  *not* a motivational phrase.  An order to 'Put Kiwi on my boots' does  *not* involve fruit.  An order to 'Make my Boots black and shiny' does not  involve electrical tape.  The proper response to a lawful order is not  'Why?'  The following words and phrases may not be used in a cadence-  Budding sexuality, necrophilia, I hate everyone in this formation and wish they  were dead, sexual lubrication, black earth mother, all Marines are latent  homosexuals, Tantric yoga, Gotterdammerung, Korean hooker, Eskimo Nell, we've  all got jackboots now, slut puppy, or any references to squid.  May not  make posters depicting the leadership failings of my chain of  command.  &#8216;The Giant Space Ants' are not at the top of my chain of  command.  If one soldier has a 2nd Lt bar on his uniform, and I have an  E-4 on mine It means he outranks me. It does not mean &#8216;I have been promoted  three more times than you'.  It is better to beg forgiveness than to ask  permission, no longer applies to Specialist Schwarz.  Command decisions do  *not* need to be ratified by a 2/3 majority.  Inflatable novelties do  *not* entitle me to BAQ or Separation pay.  There are no evil clowns  living under my bed.  There is no &#8216;Anti-Mime' campaign in Bosnia.

No  military functions are to be performed &#8216;Skyclad'.  Woad is not camouflage  makeup.  May not conduct psychological experiments on my chain of  command.  "Teddy Bear, Teddy bear, turn around" is *not* a  cadence.  The MP checkpoint is not an Imperial Stormtrooper roadblock, so  I should not tell them "You don't need to see my identification, these are not  the droids you are looking for."  I may not call block my chain of  command.  I am neither the king nor queen of cheese.  Not allowed to  wear a dress to any army functions.  May not bring a drag queen to the  battalion formal dance.  May not form any press gangs.  Must not  start any SITREP (Situation Report) with "I recently had an experience I just  had to write you about...."  Must not use military vehicles to &#8216;Squish'  things.  Not allowed to make any Psychological Warfare products depicting  the infamous Ft. Bragg sniper incident.  May not challenge anyone in my  chain of command to the &#8216;field of honor'.  If the thought of something  makes me giggle for longer than 15 seconds, I am to assume that I am not allowed  to do it.  Must not refer to 1st Sgt as &#8216;Mom'.  Must not refer to  the Commander as &#8216;Dad'.  Inflatable sheep do *not* need to be displayed  during a room inspection.  I am not authorized to initiate  Jihad.  When asked to give a few words at a military ceremony &#8216;Romper  Bomper Stomper Boo' is probably not appropriate.  Nerve gas is not  funny.  Crucifixes do not ward off officers, and I should not test  that.  I am not in need of a more suitable host body.  &#8216;Redneck  Zombies' is not a military training aid.  Gozer does not dwell in my  refrigerator.  The proper response to a chemical weapon attack is not  &#8216;Tell my chain of command what I really think about them, and then poke holes in  their masks.'  A smiley face is not used to mark a  minefield.  Claymore mines are not filled with yummy candy, and it is  wrong to tell new soldiers that they are.  I am not allowed to mount a  bayonet on a crew-served weapon.  Rodents are not entitled to burial with  full military honors, even if they are "casualties of war".  My commander  is not old enough to have fought in the civil war, and I should stop implying  that he did.  Vodka, green food coloring, and a &#8216;Cool Mint&#8217; Listerine®  bottle is not a good combination.  I am not allowed to bum cigarettes off  of anyone under twelve.  I may not trade my rifle for any of the  following: Cigarettes, booze, sexual favors, Kalishnikovs, Soviet Armored  vehicles, small children, or bootleg CD&#8217;s.  Must not mock command  decisions in front of the press.  Should not taunt members of the press,  even if they are really fat, exceptionally stupid, and working for UPI.  I  am not authorized to change national policy in Eastern Europe.  Never,  ever, attempt to correct a Green Beret officer about anything.  I am not  qualified to operate any US, German, Polish, or Russian Armored  vehicles.  When saluting a &#8216;leg&#8217; officer, an appropriate greeting is not  "Airborne leads the wa- oh...sorry sir".  There is absolutely no need to  emulate the people from &#8216;Full Monty&#8217; every time I hear the song "Hot  Stuff".  I cannot trade my CO to the Russians.  I should not  speculate on the penis size of anyone who outranks me.  Crucifying mice -  bad idea.  Must not use government equipment to bootleg  pornography.  Burn pits for classified material are not revel fires -  therefore it is wrong to dance naked around them.  I cannot arrest  children for being rude.  An EO briefing is probably not the best place to  unveil my newest off color joke.  I should not use government resources to  &#8216;waterproof&#8217; dirty magazines.  Radioactive material should not be stored  in the barracks.  I should not teach other soldiers to say offensive and  crude things in Albanian, under the guise of teaching them how to say  potentially useful phrases.  Two drink limit does not mean first and  last.  Two drink limit does not mean two kinds of drinks.  Two drink  limit does not mean the drinks can be as large as I like.  &#8216;No Drinking Of  Alcoholic Beverages&#8217; does not imply that a Jack Daniel&#8217;s ® IV is  acceptable.  "Shpadoinkle" is not a real word.  The Microsoft ®  &#8216;Dancing Paperclip&#8217; is not authorized to countermand any orders.  &#8216;I&#8217;m  drunk&#8217; is a bad answer to any question posed by my commander.  No dancing  in the turret. This especially applies in conjunction with rule #113.  The  loudspeaker system is not a forum to voice my ideas.  The loudspeaker  system is not to be used to replace the radio.  The loudspeaker system is  not to be used to broadcast the soundtrack to a porno movie.  An order to  put polish on my boots means the whole boot.  Shouting &#8216;Let&#8217;s do the  village! Let&#8217;s do the whole fucking village!&#8217; while out on a mission is  bad.  Should not show up at the front gate wearing part of a Russian  uniform, messily drunk.  Even if my commander did it.  Must not  teach interpreters how to make "MRE" bombs.  I am not authorized to sell  mineral rights.  Not allowed to use a broadsword to disprove &#8216;The Pen is  Mightier than the sword&#8217;.  'Calvin-Ball' is not authorized PT.  I do  not need to keep a 'range card' by my window.  'K-Pot, LBE, and a thin  coat of Break-free' is not an authorized uniform.  I should not drink  three quarts of blue food coloring before a urine test.  Nor should I  drink three quarts of red food coloring, and scream during the same.  I  should not threaten suicide with pop rocks and Coke ®.  Putting red 'Mike  and Ike's' ® into a prescription medicine bottle, and then eating them all in a  formation is not funny.  Must not create new DOD forms, then insist they  be filled out.  On Sports Day PT, a wedgie is not considered a legal  tackle.  The proper way to report to my Commander is 'Specialist Schwarz,  reporting as ordered, Sir' not 'You can't prove a thing!'  The following  items do not exist: Keys to the Drop Zone, A box of grid squares, blinker fluid,  winter air for tires, canopy lights, or Chem-Light ® batteries.  I should  not assign new privates to 'guard the flight line'.  Shouldn't treat  'piss-bottles' with extra-strength icy hot.  Teaching Albanian children to  taunt other soldiers is not nice.  I will no longer perform 'lap-dances'  while in uniform.  If I take the uniform off, in the course of the  lap-dance, it still counts.  The revolution is not now.  When  detained by MP's, I do not have a right to a strip search.  No part of the  military uniform is edible.  Bodychecking General officers is not a good  idea.  Past lives have absolutely no effect on the chain of  command.  Take that hat off.  There is no such thing as a  were-virgin.  I do not get 'that time of month'.  No, the pants are  not optional.  Not allowed to operate a business out of the  barracks.  Especially not a pornographic movie studio.  Not even if  they *are* 'especially patriotic films'  Not allowed to 'defect' to OPFOR  during training missions.  On training missions, try not to shoot down the  General's helicopter.  'A full magazine and some privacy' is not the way  to help a potential suicide.  I am not allowed to create new levels of  security clearance.  Furby ® is not allowed into classified areas. (I  swear to the gods, I did not make that up, it's actually DOD policy).  We  do not 'charge into battle, naked, like the Celts'.  Any device that can  crawl across the table on medium, does not need to be brought into the  office.  I am not to refer to a formation as 'the boxy rectangle  thingie'.  I am not 'A lesbian trapped in a man's body'.  On Army  documents, my race is not 'Other'.  Nor is it 'Secretariat, in the  third'.  Pokémon® trainer is not an MOS.  There is no FM for  'wall-to-wall counseling'.  My chain of command has neither the time, nor  the inclination to hear about what I did with six boxes of Fruit Roll-Ups.  ®  When operating a military vehicle I may *not* attempt something 'I saw  in a cartoon'.  My name is not a killing word.  I am not the Emperor  of anything.  Must not taunt officers in the throes of nicotine  withdrawal, with cigarettes.  May not challenge officers to 'Meet me on  the field of honor, at dawn'.  Do not dare SERE graduates to eat bugs.  They will always do it.  Must not make s'mores while on guard  duty.  Our Humvees cannot be assembled into a giant  battle-robot.  The proper response to a briefing is not 'That's what you  think'.  The Masons, and Gray Aliens are not in our chain of  command.  Shouldn't take incriminating photos of my chain of  command.  Shouldn't use Photoshop ® to create incriminating photos of my  chain of command.  I am not allowed to give tattoos.  I am not  allowed to sing 'Henry the VIII I am' until verse 68 ever again.  Not  allowed to lead a 'Coup' during training missions.  I should not confess  to crimes that took place before I was born.  My chain of command is not  interested in why I 'just happen' to have a kilt, an inflatable sheep, and a box  of rubber bands in the back of my car.  Must not valiantly push officers  onto hand grenades to save the squad.  Despite the confusing similarity in  the names, the "Safety Dance" and the "Safety Briefing" are never to be  combined.  'To conquer the earth with an army of flying monkeys" is a bad  long term goal to give the re-enlistment NCO.  NEVER nail a stuffed bunny  to a cross and put it up in front of the Battalion Headquarters sign as an  "Easter Desecration."  Don't write up false gigs on a HMMWV PMCS. ("Broken  clutch pedal", "Number three turbine has frequent flame-outs", "flux capacitor  emits loud whine when engaged")  Not allowed to get shot.  The  Chicken and Rice MRE is *not* a personal lubricant. (Skippy wanted this noted  for the record that this is not something he has ever attempted or considered!  It was something we heard at dinner on 22 September 2001 and it was just so  obscene it had to go here.)  Not allowed to play into the deluded  fantasies of the civlians who are "hearing conversations" from the NSA, FBI, CIA  and KGB due to the microchip the aliens implanted in their brain.  An  airsickness bag is to be used for airsickness *only*. (Also not a  Skippy-ism...this was the same dinner.)  Must not make T-shirts up  depciting a pig with the writing "Eat Pork or Die" in Arabic to bring as  civilian attire when preparing to deploy to a primarily Muslim  country.  Don't ask LTC Steele to sign my copy of Blackhawk  Down.  Must not go on nine deployments in six years that require a  security clearance that I don't have, even if the Army tells me repeatedly that  I have one and I have no reason to question them.  Do not convince NCO's  that their razorbumps are the result of microscopic parasites.

       As a former member of the MP Corps, let me just say this ....  I few bad apples do not spoil the whole bunch.  We need to take the rotten apples out and feed them to hungry beasts.    I totally agree with protecting 'our own', however, these idiot's deserve whatever they get.  Randy
