       urlLink Fahrenhite 9/11  is a must see. My mere skepticism that Moore may have been (ab)using GWB's absurdity to his own personal benefit was soon dissipated after the movie started. Yet, I left the movie irritated because of the true content of it. My wife left again today. Interestingly, she was chosen for the third consecutive time for "random security check"....ummm lol? Yo quiero mi "new filling menu" at Taco Bell; a 1/2 lb beef burrito for less than a buck...You don't pause for a second to think what kind of "beef" might be in it (especially when your "sound of reason" is out of town). My moral dogma now is Czech Vs Greece, who I was very impressed with lately especially after kicking "'dem Frenchies" out, but you know, they have done enough, let's see the Czechs win it this year. Work in the lab seems to be going fine. Twenty-first century high-speed internet may be coming to the complex soon.  This post has not been endorsed by Yum!

      I was reminded late yesterday evening that today is my/"our"  anniversary...Italy is out (yay?)...Vieri is a "flippin' donkey"...Tawjihi is F*ed up...Dad seems pissed off at his university after 38 years of graduation! Got some stuff taken care of in the lab... The "parafilm ball project" is going well and some people seem to be taking it seriously and adding new layers every day...Boss is coming back -temporarily- tomorrow... Still surviving...

      I have been a slacker the last few days, not that there is much to report. SSDD. I was "crowned" yesterday, $500 can buy you a nice porcelain crown. My sister-in-law and her son are in from Cali. The kid was just fine until 9:00 pm when he turned into a monkey who has just wiped his ass with Tabasco sauce. Today, Holland-Czech Rep was a classic. Bombay House was hot...very hot but worth every bite of it. The sequences I am working on at the moment are driving me berserk and I feel like I am a PMS'ing bitch.

      So I came in to lab meeting late because apparently my time is not as important as the county health department's physician. James looked up at me with half a smile and raised his eyebrows, I just had to say it then "Bon jour James!"...No response. Some brain giant called 7 times trying to send a fax to the lab, (s)he finally realized it was not a fax number. The fax tone is something probably used in Guantanamo to make detainees talk. Sequencher is freaking $3400+. I guess we are stuck with a single user copy. My jeans are all of a sudden baggy, and no I have not lost weight (NO WAY I AM WASTING MY CALORIES!). Coca-Cola came up with "low-carb" Coke...I guess this is just another sign of the apocalypse. And yet another mental midget working at McDonald's in the mall but that's an insignificant story. Today's games were good...The hell with work, God bless online streaming TV (again). And yeah, EAP, is now Master EAP.

      FRA-ENG was a drama. Only waiting to see and hear James's reaction when he sees the sticky note I left on his computer screen. It only says "2-1". Maybe I'll come in tomorrow morning and say to him "Bon jour". Otherwise, the title says it all. Tomorrow is another week...sigh!

      Today, Greece 2-1 Portugal, what a surprise! Spain 1-0 Russia, meh. Lunch at Chili's with Dave and Kelly and a pissed off waitress in a hurry. We then watched "21 grams" and Naomi Watts has very impressive nips even good Dave commented on them.

      Just while I remember, Tue...My wife is back Wed... Jordan 1-0 Iran!! It was unbelievable!! Thank heavens for online streaming TV, I was able to watch the game live. I was jumping and screaming like monkey in the lab but most people are used to me eccentric behavior by now. Thu... quote of the day "Low carb diets are probably the most idiotic fad since bell bottom pants!", CT apparently did not know that boss was on Atkins. Otherwise, journal club was boring! Funny how the guy who was presenting his own manuscript was told by his boos "I don't remember seeing this before, it just does not ring a bell"

      Today was mostly spent on the computer, "Sequenching" and "McClading". Seven damn sequences inserted in reverse. In short, it took from 8:30-5:30 to get some decent alignments...not bad for a first timer! If you are wondering, yes there seems to be some drug-resistance mutations that appear prior to drug treatment. Watch closely, we are yay close to curing AIDS. The lab BBQ was fun, we reverted to holding it in the park since the weather looked better. Ryan threw the frisbee straight into my forehead; he must have been getting his revenge for all the crap I give him every day. He is a very brave man to put up with me and all my BS about camels and flying carpets. It is 11:30 pm on a Friday and I am about to get started on this and my wife is calling me because apparently after she finished preparing the white sauce she realize she does not have any lasagna. I'll be right back. Fortunately (or is it?) Wal-Mart is less than a mile away. We bought the lasagna, mozzarella cheese (no comment), cold cuts, and DVD cases!  PS parts of this were written while listening to "The Sign" by "Ace of Base"

      I had a combined hour of sleep in the past 36+ hours. I am still not sure why I am overly stressed out about the annual progress review. I should be able to BS my way out of it with minimal effort. Eh,..we'll see. And this is a few days old now, but the  urlLink 2004 World Stupidity Awards  were announced. The list of winners say it all.

      Jordan has done  urlLink it  again! Jordan 2:0 Kuwait Links to the goals are  urlLink here  and  urlLink here . The 5 Jordanian fans that attended the match managed to gather enormous Chinese support for Jordan...Well, the Chinese also want to see the Koreans out.   urlLink     My phone and internet services are back up again after a frustrating thunderstorm 2 hours after my previous post. And a one-inch wasp was flying around in my bedroom this morning! I am glad I did not go to bed then...Who needs sleep anyway? Sleep is highly overrated.

      The lab has been an oven for the past few days. The A/C has been making all sort of weird noises...the reason: "Oh, it is weather related, there is nothing we can do about it, ."...So the air conditioning breaks down when it is hot, is that what you are trying to tell me miss? And here goes the holiday I was looking forward to. JC is in for his 6 month biopsy.  Sigh....

      I have been a workaholic the past few days. As I heard it from someone today: "I have seen you at some unusual hour of the day this Saturday." If he only knew, he would have said Friday, Saturday and Sunday.   High speed wireless internet still needs some time apparently. I am extremely frustrated.   Jordan held S. Korea to a deserved 0-0 draw this morning.   urlLink Amer Shafi  is GOD! I only got three hours of sleep and I was a bit slow in moving yet talkative and argumentative as usual. Today's topics included "Side Effects of Alcohol are a Mormon Propaganda", traditional Ukranian songs, and the Int'l AIDS Conference was a scientific failure because "not too many American scientists went to it", the latter initiated by an ill-phrased comment by a fellow labbie.   I'd better wrap this up; I am typing and correcting each word at least thrice,...and I am using such words as "thrice".

      Thank you SAK for referring me to  urlLink this . I had dinner at Carl's Jr. An abhorrently obese quasi-human creature was behind me; Springer material and drooling over his food 15 minutes in advance. He interrupted the nice girl greeting him: "Give me a large Coke, and large fries and..." I did not hear the rest...and what's it with people wandering around barefooted? Evolve for humanity's sake. In the lab, I am begining to see the light at the end of the tunnel...(could this be any more cliche?) Eh...that's all I guess...

      This morning I got a big grease stain on my white shirt after I bumped into my car antenna trying to get my mail. Fortunately, I watch too many OxyClean infomercials and the stain was taken care of painlessly. It remained, however, for me to wash the shirt in "the warmest water the fabric will accept." I never thought I would ask my sister-in-law for help with an electric appliance but gee, these washers just have too many options on them. Can't I just put the quarters in and press select the cycle? My horoscope for today was extremely amusing: "Your only problem will be deciding which of your many social engagements to attend." Hmmm...I think I'll stay home tonight I am still tired and hung over form all the "social engagements" I had this week. " urlLink Audition " was not as demented as " urlLink Ichi The Killer " but it did not have the same thrill to it. However, if you enjoy the idea of a metal wire cutting through flesh and bone, this movie is for you. And finally...America..Look no more for the condiment to accompany your "freedom fries",  urlLink W Ketchup  is here. Screw the 57 varieties others have to offer.

      Frustration, disappointment and occasional nervousness is what this week has been all about so far.  urlLink Meanwhile in Canada , a blind Quebec student was denied entry to English classes because his guide dog responds only to French commands, and the  urlLink Bush adminstration ordered the CDC  to have all sex-ed "content" include information on the "lack of effectiveness of condom use." Well they have a point I guess; after all condoms are only like 98% effective. And the hottest new couple is Kerry-Edwards (aka. The JJ's).

      The latest 4th of July fad this year is the "Exploding Terrorists Heads" fireworks. Read the complete "fair and balanced" story  urlLink here .   urlLink    On a different note, it appears that not only Ashcroft has got  urlLink  the talent , but also Powell is considering auditioning for American Idol. Powell serenaded the attendants of the ASEAN Regional Forum with  urlLink his own rendition  of the Village People's hit YMCA. Before the secretary of State started his number, the Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh had this to say: "I'm not worried; but the audience should be."  urlLink William Hung , your days are soon to be over buddy!

      The package got on the FedEx instead of being held at the Orem station, ve incubator was dripping water and the controls on the hood were down. The Beatles were singing 'A Hard Day's Night' which was ironic because it will be one. Just waiting for a 30 min incubation and listening to Nancy (Flashy) Ajram's 'Ah wi Nos', who would have thought her song would make it to a P3 HIV facility!  ------------------------------------------------------- This message was sent from a T-Mobile wireless phone.

      In his remarks to the Unity Journalists of Color Convention, Dubya suggested (cleverly as always) renaming the "war on terror" to "the struggle against ideological extremists who do not believe in free societies who happen to use terror as a weapon to try to shake the conscience of the free world." My question is: How long did it take him to memorize this phrase? I should give the dude some credit, it is a bit challenging. On an unrelated topic, Texas educators are considering new textbooks for their high school sexual education class. The Board of Education will likely approve four books, all of which extol the virtues of abstinence. Three make no mention of contraceptives at all while one makes passing reference to condoms. (loosely quoted from Reuters as reported on Medscape.) GL ditched his appointment, DD and SU are rumored to have quite large lymph nodes. I had an ugly hair cut as usual and I just had some waffles for dinner. Two more days until the restoration of my semi-ordinary life.

      I had my annual progress review this afternoon. Luckily, all the members of the panel were there. SZ was asleep for the major part; DS was docile today. It went extremely well. The only concern: "That's going to be a lot of work!", Oh yeah...thanks for informing me! But it was a good experience. KC is a cool dude, you'd never guess he is actually a professor. It felt passing on payday is like being financially rewarded for my achievement. Anyway, I started working again now that one thing is out of the way.  My wife is finally coming back next week. Conveniently, I have a biopsy coming in the next morning. I am tired and I need to be up early, the guys are coming to watch a game at 6 am.

      I finally regained some placidity after yesterday's match between  urlLink Jordan and Japan . We almost had it! We deserved to be in the final four! Otherwise, I am still in my self-imposed solitary confinement but no real progress is being made yet. Fortunately, I have to be done in less than 24 hours and that creates enough pressure on me to get me going. And Francis Crick, the man who helped unravel the structure of the DNA double helix,  urlLink died  of cancer. He also believed life on Earth came from another planet...Eh, the mind is such a terrible thing to waste.
