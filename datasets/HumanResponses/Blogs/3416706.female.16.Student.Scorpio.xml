      Well, today my heart is a little heavy. I feel like I am being pulled in two different directions. My heart is telling me to love, but my brain is telling me I am wrong. Well, first, let me explain. There is a boy at my school, a month or two younger than me, and my heart is falling for him. He seems so perfect to me, so like me, so good. But the problem is, he is a mormon. I could never marry a mormon, I disagree with their religion so much! They believe so much that is wrong.  Revelations 22:18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.  The book of mormon clearly violates this. And they believe we become A GOD after we die if we are good enough! It is so untrue. But then why is my heart telling me this? Why is it telling me my future could be here? With him? I am just so confused...   Love,  Sarah Confused little girl looking for the answer in God's Holy Word.

      Hi! It kind of is strange writing so everyone can here, but oh well. Well, I warn anyone who is entering this journal of three things:  1. I am a Christian. All of my posts will reflect that. 2. I am an anti-feminist, and probably most of my posts will reflect this (usually anger directed toward pro-death (pro-abortion) and pro-"gay marriage" advocates). 3. I like to rant. So if you get frustrated by the length, I am sorry. This is my "steam outlet" so I can be angry and release my stress in a positive way (some days, I just do not feel like playing guitar).  Please, tell me if you disagree with me. But please do not attack my Lord or my life. Thank you!  In His Love,  Sarah

      Boy, it has been a long time since I have posted! I am so happy, school is over next Friday, and we get our yearbooks tomorrow!!!  I am just so overly elated!!!   To update on the past few weeks, I simply have been doing some websurfing (and a lot of wishing that  urlLink Ladies against feminism  had more articles!), and some last-minute projects. I am also trying to find a national organization through which to run the Conservative club that I am trying to start at my school. I want to start one for a few reasons:  1. Republicans and other Conservatives have little chance to express their voice in my  extremely  liberal school. 2. I want to make the so called "liberal club" look like the idiots they are (Not because they are simply liberals, but because the club was started by self-proclaimed anarchists).  The only problem is I am a little shaky on heading the club. I want to be president, and I think I am capable, but I am not fully sure that it does not violate Biblical headship laws. However, I think that they may only apply to church/family settings and not to a public school. Am I right??  Well, anyway, I also downloaded a bunch of pro-Bush stuff! Go Bush!!! I am praying always for his reelection. I know he is the only Godly choice we have!  Well, not too much else to say...  In Christ Jesus,  Sarah
