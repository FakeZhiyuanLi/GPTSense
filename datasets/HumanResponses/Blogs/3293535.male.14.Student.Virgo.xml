      well i just gotta start off and say that being single sucks.............but it does have its perks. like u don't have to remember important dates such as their b day and the anniversaries or their friends names and their phone numbers and so on and so forth. for the most part i like being single but then again i do get lonely sometimes and i would wish i was with someone. but i kno if i do have someone than i will get tired of them really fast and get annoyed by their face and constant bad habits......or maybe i'm just ot picky.idk.lol. well i'll just leave it as it is for now. i'll "eventaully" have someone(i think......and hope)lol. well ttyl.

      well today was ok i guess....... nothing special happened. well there was one thing. my teahcer didn't want this toy snake that she had. so i said that i wanted it so then she threw it to me and it was soooooooooooo cool. it felt all mushy and tight. bad thing was that there is a hole in it so i'm guessing that's y she doesn't want it. well for school nothign special there........it's the same old same old. i'm glad that there is only about 5 more weeks of school left. i jsut want to leave and enjoy my youth. right now i cna't enjoy because of my classes. well i do love my core(magnet) classes there so fun!!! we get to talk and stuff..... well later for now.
