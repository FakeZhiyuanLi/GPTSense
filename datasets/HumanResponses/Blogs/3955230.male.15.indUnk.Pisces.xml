      Yeah, So using my iPod I maybey stating a pirate radio station. I found something (called iRadio I belive) and it transmitts to any FM station you like in a 35 foot radius... None of my friends live within 30 feet of me, soooo im trying to find a 10 mile minimum broadcaster for sale in Ontario Canada. I know where I can buy one but you need a radio license... which I lack. Technically aslong as I dont mess around with any licesnsed radio stations its legal by the FCC. Also today I came soooo close to buying a laptop. Its a P4 800mhz, 40gb, 64mb shared video laptop with XP pro already installed. But the thing that stopped me was the RAM... 128mb? I mean c'mon. Laptop RAM is uber expensive sooo ill just wait for a laptop that fits my needs I guess.   If anybody knows where I can get a broadcaster email me: tekno.samurai[at]gmail[dot]com

      Yeah... So I rented a couple movies at blockbuster... Pop it into my DVD player... and it was scratched to shit... I think the people that rent DVDs and scratch them should have their throats slashed with a dildo. Havnt been doing very much this summer, I have been reading aswell as writing alot of tutorials. I have alot of content written for n3rdv4n4 I just need to find a nice template for it now. Gentoo is going pretty well, I just finished writing a bash script. In the last two days I bought two computer books:  Lingo In a Nutshell Instant CGI/Perl  Im currently reading the CGI book, hopefully it will help me hack porn site logins... I gotta get out more.    Im mored.

      Not too much going on with me right now, today was kind of a lazy day, I installed Gentoo on my old box, downloaded the new version of DivX and played some Counterstrike. After that I went to work. Im currently downloading 200  more  megs of spawn comics, torrents rock...  Back to the hole I belong... and by hole I mean #golden~zeppelin

      w00t.   I got my ipod today, ended up costing me $520 with tax, I paid like $400 and my dad paid the rest. Its charging now, I tried to configure it but it died right in the middle, reminds me of the time that... nevermind... doesnt it look cute and peaceful?

      Yeah, so I went to buy my iPod today, and the services rep guy said that I really should get the extended warranty because of the iPod manufacturers bug. I asked what it was and he said that 20% of iPod's  non replaceable  batteries die... and since I dont have firewire I need the USB 2.0 dock.     iPod = $350  Dock = $40  Warranty = $60    I didnt have enough money. So now I must wait another ten days before I get paid again... I guess its ok, it will give me time to get some more songs.

      I decided I am going to get the 15 gig base iPOD. Im going to load it up with all my songs and bring it to a LAN party I am going to on friday night. I will be getting the iPOD on Wednsday. Tommorow Im prolly going to see I, Robot at the AMC. Tonight I gotta work till 9, come home and hopefully stay up all night with Polaris. I am about to register for a Adventuremail account, basically its gmail, except double the space, no invite needed and its not beta. The thing that gmail has that adeventure mail doesnt is the fact its made by google, which a big deal because google owns. Tonight I plan to work on my IRC bot a little. I updated my profile and including a picture of myself, (i r teh fuglyness) my head looks like an egg, but I usually am wearing a beenie, I just lost mine so I am waiting for the BAWLS (yum) beenie I ordered of jinx.com.    Current Mood: Bored.  Currently Listening to: Dont Cry - Milk Inc.

      Yeah, Im really really bored as always, I think Im going to make a game or something. I spend way too much time on the computer, I have had 120,000 keystrokes in less then 24 hours. I gotta go to work soon, which sucks, I downloaded a pirated and cracked copy of Trillian Pro, but I dont have access to all the plugins because I need like a special login for the site so Im just going to find like a third party plugin site. Im trying hard to get my site off the ground, its starting to die, If somehow I can get enough members and posts I will buy a SHOUTcast server aswell as an IRC server for it. Im looking to download a movie called Matchstick Men, its a movie about social engineering, I have a feeling it is on suprnova.org I just cant find it. I am still trying to decide whether I want an iPOD or an external hard drive, apparently an external hard drive on USB 2.0 will run slow... I have about 4 gigs of music on my computer so I bet I could fill up an iPOD... Well Im out.

      Its 1AM Im freakin bored... Im waiting for my friend to come online, I missed her like an hour ago which sucks, IRC is boring. I downloaded a shit load of pirated software today, I got Trillian Pro and not only do you need the program you also need a login for the program... So I guess I gotta find a hacked acount.  Heh I found my old DJ Tiesto CD, Nyana I think that is the first electronica CD I ever bought... Im listening to it now. I installed TKL and I already have 26,000 keystrokes not bad for an hour eh? Damn Im a loser. Next week Im either going to be buying an external hard drive or an iPOD I dont know which one I want yet... My frind king_of_hate is currently in hospital for an attempted suicide... Thats his second attempt in like 2 months, that really sucks, anyway I best be off.

      So I found out the modem for the 5mbit connection is linux compatible. Now I must decide, do I want a 150kbps connection that disconnects every couple hours or do I want a dedicated 5mbps connection? Hard desicion... lmao.

      One of the ISPs in my area is having a deal on internet... well uber high speed internet (5mbps which is slightly faster then T1). Im getting it soon but I dont know if thats such a good thing, I mean I can play games with little to no lag at all, but will the modem be linux compatible?

      I did a google search on my name and it turns out somebody has been using the name n0rx. I guess it good be a miss-understanding but he is prolly coping me considering the name has meaning to me and me only. I emailed him and if he doesnt start usng a new name Im gonna hack him and DDoS his site.

      Yeah, so since I got my new modem I have been disconnecting from the internet every four or so hours, which really sucks because I am in #idlerpg. I became a net admin on irc.lazychat.net which rocks, now I need to buy that IRC Junkie Tshirt off of jinx.com.  Now we just got to get all the services (Nickserv, Chanserv, Botserv etc) My modem problem does seem to be fixed, so I am going to play cs.

      My stupid ISP operators are making me trade in my modem for a new one, It better be the same as the one I currently have because D-link rocks, and its linux compatible. Ill miss my poor modem... GOOD BYE, DAN-THE-DIALER

      Yeah... My ISP is being a bitch, I was in the middle of a Counterstrike scrim and my ISP thought it might be funny to disconnect me, I havnt been able to get online all day, I dont know when I am going to be able to post this, thats up to my ISP. However I am writing it at 2:00AM Saturday. I started writing some more tutorials for my website, and I found a nice template. You can take a look at it here: http://n3rdv4n4.com/possible.html I was hoping my internet would be fixed by the time I got home from work but it wasnt. I got to go back to work at 10 am so I think Im just going to pull an overnighter and sleep when I get home tommorow. I have a new favourite song, Castles in the Sky by Ian Van Dahl. I also stummbled upon a [pirate] radio station run by some of the interns at Carleton U, I must say, they have awesome taste in music. Hopefully I can make a couple calls and become a DJ. Well I gotta go, Im gonna watch Vampire Hunter D. Cya
