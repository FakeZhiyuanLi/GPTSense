       urlLink news@nature.com�-�Cat droppings yield chic coffee : "Cat droppings yield chic coffee"  How very odd...I was reading articles and came across this one...it's almost  urlLink Fear Factor  like...   "The beans, which cost over US$1,000 a kilogram, are eaten and passed by the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), which is a musky, tree-climbing cat-like creature. The supply of Kopi Luwak has always been tiny, but political turmoil in Indonesia has strangled production even further: less than 230 kilograms of the coffee are now being made each year."   The article goes on to say:    "The civets' digestive action broke down proteins in the beans into smaller molecules that added to the flavour and aroma of the coffee on roasting. Some proteins were leached out of the beans completely, making the resulting coffee less bitter...is earthy, musty, syrupy, smooth and rich, with both jungle and chocolate undertones."   I don't think I will EVER like coffee enough to try that.  Ever.  As a matter of fact  urlLink the civit cat was linked to Sars...  That doesn't exactly lead me to the conclusion I should drink coffee made from beans gleaned from it's, um...poop.

      It's midnight...    I guess a fitting time to start something like a blog. I love the Pooh quote I based the name of this blog on,  "Rivers know this: there is no hurry. We shall get there some day."  It's actually from a book called,  Pooh's Little Instruction Book ...inspired by A.A. Milne.  I wish I could learn to believe and trust that idea. I'm always anxious. I always worry about tomorrow and the next day and the next. People always say, "Why...what does it change to worry..." I guess it doesn't change ANYTHING but I have this feeling if I DON'T worry "it's" going to sneak up on me and all will be lost!  I've been looking for a place. An online "place". Somewhere I feel like I belong and can post as I want, what I want, when I want...I gave up looking and decided to make my own.  If anyone comes along and joins me...well that would be just fine. I'd appreciate insight and ideas from others. I was looking for that, too, "out there" but I just kept finding silence or even worse animosity.  I would never walk into a room full of people I don't know and say, "Hello Room!" How corny!! But I have gone on message boards or chat rooms and screamed my presence. I guess I'm an online geek. I don't think it is supposed to be that way....I think you are supposed to be much more cool in virtual reality...ah well...it makes me feel good...so if that is being a geek...in the words of a friend of mine..."I'll be that."  Another quote from  Pooh's Little Instruction Book  :  "You can't stay in your corner of the Forest waiting for others to come to you. You have to go to them sometimes."   Hello Others... :) I guess I've come looking for you.  Lastly ..."Poetry and Hums aren't things which you get, they're things which get you. And all you can do is go where they can find you."   I'm here. I hope they find me.

       urlLink THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC   I watched this movie tonight...It was so unsettling.  I guess it was part Hollywood...With Joan being played by a very beautiful, innocent looking actress...But the very last scene, the burning at the stake scene...It was horrible.  The link above is to a Roger Ebert review of the movie, taken from the Suntimes of Chicago.  In it he says that some test audience members wrote on their sneak preview cards, "Why does she have to die at the end?"  To quote the article... "Joan of Arc was a naive young French peasant woman, illiterate, who was told by voices that she must go to the aid of her king. France at that time was ill-supplied with kings; the best it could offer was the reluctant Dauphin (John Malkovich), later Charles VII. She informed him her destiny was to lead French troops on the battlefield against the English, who were godless (or foreign, which to the French was a negligible distinction).   Legend has it she ended the siege of Orleans. Legend may be wrong. A new book published in France by the historian Roger Caratini claims "precious little of what we French have been taught in school about Joan of Arc is true." He finds scant evidence that Joan did much more than go along for the ride and adds cruelly that she could not have raised the siege of Orleans because the city was never besieged in the first place. Her trial for heresy was not at the hands of the British but under the French Inquisition at the University of Paris, and her greatest crime may have been dressing like a boy and offending the ecclesiastical gender police. Her legend was "more or less invented" in the 19th century, we learn, as a tonic for emerging French nationalism, which had a "desperate need for a patriotic mascot."   Dustin Hoffman played a sort of extra character...Like a Grand Inquisitor.  He was her "conscience" in a way.  It was a bit strange but I liked his character best.  She witnessed her sister being killed and raped (in that order) and found a sword in a field...Which she deemed a sign from God...  Hoffman's character says, "That....Was a sword...In a field."  (Sometimes a cigar...Is just a cigar?)  The movie wouldn't have been the same for me if mille Jovovich hadn't played Joan.  Sometimes the actor in a role makes the movie for me.  I admit...That isn't the best way to look at the story but I can't help it.  I think it's a movie worth seeing.   I guess this is another installment of what Chris does at  when she cannot sleep.
