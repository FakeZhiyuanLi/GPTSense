            don't you hate it when you think someone seems really nice, but then they turn around and betray you...like evan.&nbsp; he seemed nice, but we found out yesterday that he's a real jerk and he needs to die. he's pushed things way too far now cuz it was bad enough that he was saying stuff about justina, but now he's saying stuff about me and molly too so its personal now.&nbsp; all i can say is he better watch his back the next time i'm anywhere near him.    *Caitlin~    I'm leaving for camp tomorrow, so i probably won't talk to y'all til at least next saturday. have fun at band next week...lol. I'll miss you all.

            Yo!&nbsp; Not much happened today either...this has been a boring week other than having band   every   day.&nbsp; But at least I didn't have to go to my mom's house cuz that would suck.&nbsp; The only thing that I've found out today was how much of a jerk evan really is...if you don't know what i'm talking about, oh well, you'll probably end up finding out anyway...eventually.&nbsp; Well, i guess that's all for&nbsp;today. Hope y'all have fun at band next week...mwahahahahaha...cuz i'm not gonna be&nbsp;here.&nbsp; Just know&nbsp;that&nbsp;I'll miss you all. lol    Like a fat girl in dodge-ball, I'm out.    ~Caitlin*   &nbsp;   2 days til camp &nbsp;Y

      howdy everyone. are we enjoying band yet?  i must say that today didn't suck half as bad as yesterday did, evcept that i had to play more, but i'm actually starting to get my part.  for the first time since i've had the music, its started to make sense (i know its amazing, especially for me).  not much happened today, but i might not have to go and live with my mom for the rest of the summer (YAY) cuz she doesnt want the responsibility of taking me to band every day. well...i guess thats it for now cuz band has taken over my life. Cya ppl!  *Caitlin  i love you rebek...lol

      Hey people.  Band started today, which sucked, but at least the music doesnt suck as bad as i thought it was going to.  But the idea of getting up and going to band at 9:00 every morning doesnt make me happy.  And i still want Mr. Barr back.  I still havent started on my homework for mrs. un-fun-roe, even though its due in 3 weeks.  Other than that, nothing has happened today...band now rules my life once again.  Now there's nothing left to say. Bye bye homies...lol  *Caitlin*

      YAY...i set up a blog.  Everyone is getting Xanga, so i got blog to be different.  Not much happened today...thats only cuz its sunday and nothing ever happens on sunday, but oh well.  This is going to sound really retarded (but look who's typing it) but i'm addicted to spiderman.  I saw Spiderman 2 and i was hooked to the point that i want to play the videogame  all day then watch the movies, then go to the Spiderman website...and the people that i have to thank are Katey, Ashley and Abbi.  Band starts tomorrow...YAY (not really).  Its going to be so depressing and weird to go to band and not be able to see mr. barr there.  not to mention the fact that i still don't have much of my music memorized...oops.  Well i'm gonna go for now.  I'll write more tomorrow about the first day of band...*in sarcastic tone* I cant wait.   *caitlin*
