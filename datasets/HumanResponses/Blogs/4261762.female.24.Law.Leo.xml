      I must say, and this may sound very sad, but last night was one of the best dates that I have ever been on.  It was the second time that I went out with Ryan...I told him it was up to him what we were doing and that if I called him and asked what we were doing and he said he didn't know I was going to hang up the phone and never speak to him again.  Nice, I know.  Anyway, I called him and he said it was a surprise - so here I was, use to being very much in control of every situation and here I have a guy telling me he is going to surprise me - I must admit I was a little scared.   I digress...I met him at his apartment, which I found on the first try and didn't even get lost trying! yeah!! and was told that we were going bowling and something else, the other part was the surprise.  He took out a map and said that he had been at a coffee shop that afternoon and purchased it and there was a treasure that we had to find.  I must admit this frightened me...but then he fessed up - he drew the map himself and there really was a treasure that he put there.  Before I continue the story I must preface it with the fact that I have no sense of direction whatsoever, I can't read maps, and I get lost every time I leave my "area."  With that said, we hopped on his motorcycle ready for adventure.  After looking around for a while, he caved and showed me where it was hidden...it was a box with a kite in it.  He thought that it was a perfect night for flying a kite.  So that is what we did...my first time flying a kite mind you.  It was the sweetest thing!  After being there for probably an hour or hour and a half we decided to continue on and go bowling.  He kicked my butt! 107 to 70...it wasn't pretty, but it was fun.   We returned to his apartment where we set off the smoke detector making pizza...or maybe it was just the "heat" between us.  I'm not going to elaborate on those details...use your imagination.   I called him when I was driving home, so he could keep me awake...we talked until I got home and then said our good-byes.  I fell asleep with a smile on my face...it's still there actually!

      Well Hello!! This is my first post on my blog...I've been putting a lot of thought into it, wanting it to be perfect and all...well finally I decided to just go with it and write. I must admit that up until a week ago I did not even know what a "blog" was...in fact I'm sure the look of confusion on my face when my boss suggested I start writing one must have been priceless.    So, how does this work? Do I just write with the hope of getting feed back...or do I write with the hope that nobody reads it and I can be as candid as I would be as if I were writing in my personal journal? What level of privacy can I expect? It's hard to say...wouldn't it just be a laugh if someone that I was writing about happened to find this and WHAM! they will know my innermost thoughts and feelings about them...I'm not sure how I feel about that.    But wait, I entitled this "introduction" so that means I should be introducing myself.  What would you like to know? I'm 24 (just turned, I almost wrote 23) and live currently in Eden Prairie, but will soon be moving.  I have not decided on my new location yet...but I have looked at some places in Minneapolis.  I work for a law firm in downtown Minneapolis, which, as is a rarity in life, I actually really enjoy my job!  My greatest wish and dream in life is to find my prince charming...I'm not into the whole fairy tale story of life, I have more realistic expectations than that...but I am also a firm believer that there is someone out there for everyone and that one, when I find him, will be my prince.  My biggest fear is becoming that "crazy cat lady" that every neighborhood has. I own one cat, who at times seems more like a child to me than anything...which justifies my fear every single day!  There is a just a little bit about me...you'll find out more in the days, weeks, months, etc. to come.   Until next time...
