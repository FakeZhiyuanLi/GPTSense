      From Google News:  Al-Jazeera 'Osama loves volleyball, hates ice' Times of India - 1 hour ago OTTAWA : A documentary about a Canadian family closely linked to Osama bin Laden portrays the Al Qaida chief as a well-meaning family man who banned ice in drinks, loves volleyball and has trouble controlling his children.   He hates ICE?  This is the most feared asswipe on the planet and he banned the use of ice in drinkies?   Well meaning family man ?  Boy did we get the wrong idea about this guy or what?  I got  28 bucks  American  for whoever turns this guy into a stain. E-mail me a polaroid and I'l get it right out to you.  C. Thomas Howell just announced that he regrets making  Side Out  as it may have been partially responsible for Osama's hatred of American culture.  Ooh, C.Tommy, you got a lot of 'splaining to do.

      This is the most tired I've been in a long time. But, I guess that's what I get for staying at Justin's so late.  Rather than doing any of the myriad of tasks I have to do relating to my job, I have spent most of the day downloading new fonts. I hope to use one of these in the what I think is the 4th or possibly 5th incarnation of Monkey1.com. I've also been trying to recruite people smarter than me to work on the site. That's how I got SimianCinema to work so well. I want the hiplog to integrate into the site as well as Greg's extremely cool gallery tool. If you've never seen Greg's site you should check it out.  urlLink WWW.TINYGRASSHOPPER.COM .  Anyway, this killed another 5 minutes or so of my day. Let's see what I can find to do next in order to avoid my extremely boring job.

      This has got to be the most bored I have been since my third time through Geometry in high school.  There is nothing going on and nothing to do anywhere.  This would be a great time to start that alcohol problem I've always wanted.  So ya know how farts stink (and sometimes sound) as wretched as a Father Dowling Mysteries marathon?  Do you suppose that that (I love when I can legally use a word twice in a row in a sentence) is what our goopy insides smell like?  And for that matter would an operating room/embalming room/autopsy parlour(?) be considered a  free fart zone *?  And for that matter what else, besides ripping incredible cheese bombs while they dig through our guts, are doctors doing while we're under.  For me I know I'd find it hard to resist not doing like a little puppet show with people while they were knocked out.  Then again, maybe that's just the boredom talkin'.  Oooo look - a bottle of whiskey in the pantry....   * free fart zone  - Any area (i.e. - off of the 15 in Norco) where one can freely expel gaseous eminations from their self without reprisal.

      I have spent the better part of today trying to get the domain name http://www.flickerfactory.com back up and running.  Beginning to wonder why.  I spoke to one of the famously reported 'outsourced' tech support dudes from Delhi.  He wanted to helpful, told me to call my bank.  Listened to The Pixies and shouted "F#&%" out loud a few times.  Spoke to my bank (wish they were outsourced to Delhi).  I know someone is having a worse day.  Sorry about that dude.  and... it is FRIDAY.

      So we have these outdoor speakers in the backyard (makes sense because that's outdoors and all, anyhoo) that are connected to the computer which has an inordinant amount of music on it, right?  Well I have to confess that sometimes when the gardners show up (and they trample the dog poop into the grass making it virtually impossible to pick up later as they do the gardening thing) I like to blast really odd sound effects out there or just turn on the most obnoxious music I can find, just to watch them freak out.  It's almost funnier than shouting "IMMIGRACION!" while they work - almost.

        I'm stoked because I just stole that song that was in Scream (when they pan out with the crane shot showing the kids going home early because of the curfew due to the two guys running around killing chix and stuff, 'member?) and Dumb & Dumber (when he has the big foam hat on and he berates the old lady into watching his crap while he goes to get change for a dollar, ya know...).    It's Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds - "Red Right Hand".  I like this song, in fact I like it so much I think I might go post on the blog about how i just stole it from the 'net for next to, if not as much as nothin'!  Wait a second, I already am posting about it - well crap - nevermind...

      So here I am waiting for the damn gardners to show up.  Every week they show up alter and later.  This has no bearing on anyone else in the world but me, but dammit this is killing me.  Otherwise, I sit here wondering what can I do for free (and there the gardners are) that won't involve any kind of self abuse or driving.  Hmmm?

       Hi there.  I can't believe that our 25 year reunion is coming up.  I can't wait to meet up with everyone at the Sheraton Hotel in June.  We've got lots to catch up on. 25 years, wow!!  What have I been up to? Well until recently I was working for a privately funded organization known as FLAG, the Foundation for Law And Government.  At FLAG we did lots of cool stuff.  One time I had to chase an armored car through the sewers of North Hollywood before it could steal a rare new element.  Another time I had a mexican standoff against a semi truck made out of the same molecular bonded shell as my 'bitchen' 82 Trans Am, and to top it off, it was being driven by my evil twin ( who had a goatee so you could tell us apart ).  That was two-parter if you know what I mean! My boss was tensed-up European dude named Devon Myles.  I think he was from France or maybe Paris.  He was pretty good guy for a boss but most of the time my annual review would get postponed because he'd been kidnapped by Canadian Terrorists and I'd have to go and ' bring the beatdown ' if you know what I mean ( wink ). His secretary, Bonnie was totally hot for me.  But like my Dad always used to say, " You don't poop where you eat " so I set her up with the guy that fixed the copier, and then dumped her for cheating on me.  Eventually I had to leave the company to pursue my dream of becoming a lifeguard in Malibu.  I'm still waiting to hear back from them, so keep those fingers crossed.  Still no wedding ring, but I should tell the ladies out there that I was married briefly but she was killed by ninjas, it sucked.  But now I'm cool and ready to love again.  I hope that ' Stinky  Poncharello and Sonny" the man " Crockett show up. Those guys were way cool.   Go Van Nuys Huskies!!   Mikey " the Night Rocker " Knight

         WASHINGTON D.C.  ( Capitol PennyThrift & Coupon Caddy )  In a press conference today, U.S. President George W. Bush declared that America's phone systems were in league with the " Evil, evil forces of evil. ".  " My voicemail is all jacked up and the speakerphone?  Forget about it.  Don't get me started on weekend minutes, what a gyp! " Bush was also heard to complain that " Someone has been calling Pizza Hut ordering up to 10 pies a night delivered to the White House for a 'Miss Juwanna Hugmaballs'...  How much clearer does it have to be America? " Bush spoke while pointing at a photograph of beloved funnyman Dudley Moore and announcing "Osama, we  will  find you".  When pressed the President was not able to reveal any further details.  It is no secret that the President has expressed serious doubts in the " safeosity, strongtitude and securityness " of our nation's telecommunications network; however he has rarely gone on record with his concerns.  Wyoming Congressman Tad Waverley attended the press conference, " This is the least remarkable thing I ever heard. But did you notice those little party snacks by the door?  I gotta come to more of these things!! ", and later added " This is a full size Baby Ruth bar!  All these are full size.  I'm gonna take some with me in case its a long session in congress tonight.  Wait a minute, is that a Clark bar..? ".  Dudley Moore died in 2002 of pneumonia as a complication of progressive supranuclear palsy and could not be reached for comment.  His estate has denied any connection to al-Quaeda and Miss Juwanna Hugmaballs.

         COSTA MESA, CA  (AP/Reuters)  Homeowners on the street of Andy & Kate Cauble are divided at the 'new fangled' and 'fancy poop palace' that the couple has erected their back yard.  Construction was done " On the downlow " and " Mostly at night when nobody can see us workin' "       " Hell of a thing " said neighbor Les Fincher, " It puts my outdoor statue of Sean Cassidy to shame.  Bully for them ".       However, not all of the couple's neighbors are supportive, " As a taxpayer I don't see why  they  can have a fancy outdoor bathroom and I have to put up with my cramped indoor bathroom, which I share with my pet llama, Gus " said one neighbor who asked not be identified.       Code enforcement officials at City Hall have few problems with the structure, even though it violates a local ordinance by 96 storeys, and includes a restaurant level and ample parking for 450 vehicles.       " Lets just say, they didn't forget to sign the application with a 'Ben Franklin' if you know what I mean " said  "Friendly"  George Romanetti, co-chair of the city's planning department.  Romanetti is presently under investigation by Orange County's grand jury on an unrelated matter.       " We just wanted something a little special " said Cauble. " And since I spend upwards of 6 hours a day in the can, I figured we should do it up fancy ".       As a conciliatory olive branch, Cauble has invited his neighbors to " come on in an try out the facilities, see what all the fuss is about. " but warned to " bring yer own paper, I ain't made o'money ".

      Everyone can post images to the site.  In your post simply use the following code:  (It's typed funny so it doesn't get read actual code)  Inside the <> tags type img src="  PATH NAME  " where   PATH NAME   is the location of your image.  ie. img src="http://www.healthday.com/images/editorial/manstomachsm.jpg" (this is the image Toby posted of the guys gut)  If you have an image you would like to use for the site that is not already on the world wide web, send it to me and I will post it on Monkey1.com and send you the path to use in your code.  Also, if you have a funny picture of yourself you would like to use on the site send it to me and I will make them all the same size so we can use them in the title bar, side panel, or as a signature image.

      Kid Snickers you have pulled off a very clean and unnecessary coup, and for that I am in awe.  (Not like look at that cute little puppy kind of "awe", or like that "awe" sound you make when you realize your penis has become a circus peanut as you disembark a chilly wintery pool, but more like the "awe" you're in when you realize that as an adult you could potentially eat cookies all day and nobody could stop you kind of awe.)  What would be really cool is if we could all post pictures instead of you hoggin' all the visually aided fun for yourself.  Remember, "They who coup can be couped as well.  Robble, robble." (An excerpt from The Hamburglar Diaries, circa 1990)

      As said in tonight's/today's Thursday Knight session, I think Guy's nickname should be...   Mr. DNA   Why? 1) Because it is part of the song which has borne our tiny tiny tiny community's name 2) Becuase of his super human ability to impregnate his wife 3) Becuase the Shamrock Shake only comes around once a year and I think we should all take advantage of it's limited, yet widespread availablity.  P.S. I'm well aware that shakes (and for that matter mass manufactured dairy products of any sort) have nothing to do with Guy's need for a moniker, but I think the aneurism just flared up again....... wait....... yep....... it's the aneurism..... PACHINKO PLAYIN' GLAMOUR ROCKET!!!!!   (Sorry - I'll get this under control by the next post)

        The Girlfriend, in The Living Room, with The iPod   Posted Mar 11, 2004, 9:32 AM ET by Sean Bonner  Brad Pulaski had died of blunt trauma to the head after being repeatedly bludgeoned with an iPod, a popular MP3 player produced by Apple.  Police said no motive has been confirmed, although evidence suggested the murder was the result of a domestic dispute after Pulaski erased the contents of Mathers’ iPod.  According to law officers, Mathers was hysterical when police arrived and told them that she killed her boyfriend only after he accused her of illegally downloading music and erased about 2,000 of her MP3s. Mathers complained that it took 3 months to build her music collection.                                                                                                  lifted from: http://apple.weblogsinc.com/   Toby adds:    I'm no Dr.Phil, but something tells me these kids were having some problems way before the iPod came along.  However I did give Dr. Phil a call and he said...      "Hi, I'm Dr. Phil.  If this was  my  girlfriend I'd have to ask her just what the hell is the matter with her.  But maybe I would've gotten her a mini iPod 'cause they are awesome, and being a lot smaller she'd probably just bust up her hand instead of really doing any real damage to me (or my head).  Sometimes people just don't 'think it out before they act it out'.  She had a lot of  stolen  mp3s in her collection, I hope it wasn't anything by  Hootie and The Blowfish , cause those fellahs are real nice and they need the money to support that one guy  "Hootie"  and his cocaine problem.  If it was something by those  Creed  guys, well I would not give a toss, those guys just plain suck.  It ain't worth killing over ('specially Creed).  And  don't steal music  folks, my good friend Andy has it all anyway"   Smart guy that Dr. Phil.  Maybe that's why they made him a doctor.

      I think Guy's moniker should be "Ace of Bass". Bass like the fish. Not bass like the guitar he plays.  Speaking of Guy playing bass (Yes, I mean the guitar this time. Not the fish.) Here's a picture of Guy working his magic at Angel's in beautiful downtown Corona. And by "beautiful downtown", I mean "horrid industrial area of"

      What has happened to our society?  Why do people think it's ok to talk in movies? Why do people use speaker phones at full volume in a shared office enviroment? Why do people leave their cell phones on their desks with the ring at full volume when they know they aren't going to be there to answer it?  WHY ARE PEOPLE SO RETARDED?   Think about how your actions might affect other people before you make them. Have some respect for your fellow man.  Maybe next time I'm driving my car through the parking lot, I won't think about how pushing on the brake pedal might stop me from running your stupid ass over.

      Just because I don't hold pizza in the same regard as the Puma, does not mean I dislike him. I love him, in that gay movie kind of way.  Not "Will and Grace" gay, but more like tender gay porn. Congrats on the tix.  Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared, Family Guy, Firefly, and Futurama, are good shows.   Greg The Bunny, on the other hand, we will have to agree to disagree.  Doppler 7000 Bitch!  I also am curious about the true identities of phatty and hombre.  Did I ruin this blog?  I think I turned it into a message board.  I need a cool moniker too.  Any suggestions?

      I mean I have many weather choices but do I go with Channel 4 Pinpoint Doppler or ABC's Doppler 7000 or every other station that has Doppler. One station Doppler that predicts weather down to the street THE FUCKING STREET!! (These dipshits couldn't predict Burritos at Del Taco)That is bullshit Fuckin sell the Doppler and buy a Camero because if u are a weatherman in CA you can predict the weather by waking up and saying it will be sunny today and 9 times out of ten they are wrong. The news sucks. And many happy times to Andy and his scratchers. Craig Kilborn is not funny. (By the way there is a 100% chance of Burritos at Del Taco with a 60% chance of undercooked fries)...................................And does being a fucking Asshole pay a lot of money? Cuz everyone is doing it.

      What is the mystery you ask?  Who is "phatty fat-fat-fat" and "el hombre alto"?  Who could these most mysterious of the mysterious Patrolmen be?  I wonder, you wonder, everyone wonders if the question of these Patrolmen's identities will ever be solved.....

      Look who is the proud owner of 50 scratcher tix for answering the trivia question right - ME!!!  Though getting tickets to a game would have been absolutely great, somehow I have absolutely no trouble winning a fistful o' lottery tix.  I can't believe I just called a station and actually pulled this crap off!!  With no thanks to Jesus or his deadbeat Dad, I have pulled off what I have only said I would do in passing.  Dammit - I'M A WINNER!!  Could things be turning around?  Could this be the dawn of a new "good spot" for myself, my kin and my fellow Patrolmen?  If you ask me I think so!!!  P.S. - Guy, why you hate me, I have nothing but love for you and yours.... :(   I WIN!! I WIN!! I WIN!! I WIN!!

      As of right now I'm on hold to speak to one Larry Burnett, the incredibly white, annoying and medicore host of Lakerline (the call-in show on radio after every game).  I have never been so bored as to call a radio station, but there's a first time for everything (including the inevitable puking in an inappropriate place, 'member Toby?) so I figured screw it, I'm calling.    Also, I have the correct answer to the nightly trivia question and that will yield me  tix * to a game.  Though my first reflex is to try and say "meow" ten times in the conversation, I'll have to hold back.    I'm next to come on, so wait a minute here...  Damn on a break now, but I'm next on after the commercials...  While we wait - here's one of your favorite songs for you to sing in your head.....   *  tix  - the "Heavy Metal/Hollywood" spelling of tickets.  Also acceptable is putting a "z" on the end of plural words, i.e. - boyz, girlz.

      Yesterday, I went to Target on my way to work and picked up some DVDs. One of them being the George Ramero classic,  "Dawn of the Dead" . This seems to be a popular title, well loved by the members of The Smart Patrol. So, I won't waste time talking about it. However, my other purchase brings up a topic which has plagued the Thursday Knights since their inception. That's right, I forked over $35 (plus tax) for the  "Futurama: Season 3"  box set.  Why is it that every program that we have ever loved is tossed aside like it's the nations red headed step child?  Freaks & Geeks ,  Undeclared ,  Greg The Bunny ,  Family Guy ,  Firefly  (for those that have seen it) and Futurama, just to name a few. So as not to waste to much of your time I will give you the Cliff Notes version of the answer:  "AMERICA IS FILLED WITH RETARDS!"  And I'm not talking about the happy go lucky, short a chromosome retards that we have all come to love (Except Guy. Retards make him uncomfortable). I'm talking just stupid, stupid individuals who watch the same Prime Time crap from night to night.  How many nights in a row can you watch some guy figure out that a husband killed his wife for the insurance money by finding a pubic hair in his carpet? Everyone doesn't love Raymond. I have news for you:  Raymond's an asshole!  I think the DISH network might have the best deal ever. Please take CBS away. I don't think anyone will be missing classics, like "The King of Queens" or "Star Search". Who cares if Betty Joe beats out Bobby Sue in the "Best 8-Year Old Hog Caller from Bum-F*ck Idaho" competition?  When the majority of good television isn't even made available to the general public, because they can't afford cable, it worries me even more. People are just going to keep getting dumber and dumber and then there really won't be anything for us to watch anymore. It's just disappointing that the networks don't give good shows a chance to catch an audience.

      The OLD voice of reason was Fuu Hououji. Pizza is NOT the be all, end all, of food products.   It's good, maybe great, but not the best. I think the Puma may have lost his way.

      For some time now I have been waiting for her to find me.  Some would suggest that love has to be sought out, nurtured and cultivated and a whole lot of 'hoo-ey'. But, seeing that I am much smarter than most people, I concocted a plan of such elegant simplicity that the ramifications are yet to be truly appreciated.  I did nothing.  Rather than risk missing her by a minute due to a series of romantic comedy mishaps ( see Serendipity... actually  don't  see Serendipity, but if you saw the trailer then you know what I mean ) I decided that the smart money was on keeping still, and waiting her out.  I'm still waiting.  My mother ( who is insane now, but used to be okay ) told me that there was someone for everyone.  A special person that God made just for you.  I knew she was right, because I was six and so far Mom was batting a thousand.  Ever since that day I've been wondering if my Miss Right was ever going to show up.  It is entirely possible that Miss Right lost my trail in 1988 when my family moved across the country to California for my Dad's work.  While I did make several pleas to my parents, they decided that Miss Right or no, I should move with them to California rather than live in a tent in my friend's backyard ( my original plan ).  I made sure that all our neighbors had the new address but Mrs. Grandt who lived next door was still holding a grudge from the time I set her fence on fire, so I can't be sure she held on to the index card with our address on it.  She's dead now, so I'm not mad at her.  But I am getting mad at Miss Right(  just kidding ).  After all, time is getting on.  I have dodged any other forms of commitment to keep my options open for her arrival.  Granted I have considered going and looking for her myself, but I was sure that was a recipe for disaster and decided to stick to my plan.  I am, however, listed in the phone book including my address.  Unfortunately the phone book people don't accept photographs for inclusion so I'm just going to have to hope that Miss Right has enough gumption to work her way through to the Ws. ( HINT: Start at the end of the book and work your way backwards ).  I also check with information ( the 411 people ) just to make sure that my listing is in order, at the moment they don't keep tally of how many requests there have been for my number, so I don't know if Miss Right has called yet.  Maybe the phone company should consider adding that service, just an idea.  Three years ago I recieved a call from someone who could have been Miss Right, however I found it very doubtful that  my  Miss Right would only speak Spanish, and since my name is not Manuel Soto, I had to tell the woman on the phone that I was not her 'Señor Verdad' after all.  As it turned out she was trying to reach Mr. Soto because he had not paid his cable television bill in four months and had no romantic interest in him whatsoever.  However I wished her much luck on her search.  This Summer I will finally get approval from the city to put up my billboard( Fingers crossed ).  After eighteen months and six rejections from the planning commission, my billboard will go up on the corner of Seventeenth and Walnut.  I would like to thank Mr. Gerald Bennett from next door for letting me put some of the billboard over his house as well as mine,  Thanks Mr. B!   So as you can see, I've certainly done my fair share of the work here.  So if Miss Right is out there, she really has no excuse for not finding me.  After all this, I still believe in true love.

       Hollywood, CA -    Wednesday  (AP/Reuters)  Horror 'meister' George Romero's  Icky Slashy Pictures  has begun production on their newest feature.   Brunch Of The Extremely Sluggish  will be lensing in L.A. and Mexico where Romero said, " They ain't got laws or nothin' so we're using REAL zombies an' stuff ". The movie is described as a prequel/sequel with heavy re-imagining of the original  '... of the Dead'  films.  " With CGI and stuff, we think we gonna have it all done and in the theaters by a week from Tuesday " Romero added " and we're releasing it on DVD and Laserdisc the day before... to beat the rush ".  Former American President and head of  People for the Ethical Treatment of Zombies  ( petz ) George Washington, has been opposed to runaway Mexican zombie production for sometime, when reached for comment, Washington said "BRAINS!!" and tried (unsuccessfully) to eat our reporter through the telephone.

      And try sticking it to the woman. It is more fun but she gets half your stuff. I also bought the Dawn of the Dead cuz Holy hell it was only $11.99. I would buy a movie called 7:45 of the Dead. I was at Subway and some stupid chunky vagina carrier was talking to her friend about how she is starting the Subway diet then she procedes to get a footlong Turkey sub with extra cheese and mayo with lots of oil on top and wash it down with a huge coke. (Hey bitch you can't lose weight if you need a fuckin ruler to measure your food) She will be found guilty of being fuckin stupid and sentenced to be fat. By the way if they make a sequel to the Day of the Dead can it take place at a Dave Matthews concert?

      I'm at "work" now.  I got here early because of my lack of something else to do.  I've eaten my lunch (another wonderful meal from the small spot of edible heaven known as Sushi Box) and now I'm using their internet connection for my own entertainment until I fell like starting work.    I'm planning on swiping some stamps to send some bills out today.  My little covert way fo sticking it to the Man again.  I honestly believe that I'm addicted to sticking it, either to something or someone or to some entity of some sort....some.  I bought the Dawn Of The Dead DVD before I came to work and I have made a goal for myself to get the hell outta here  A.F.A.P. * so I can go watch it tonight.  If you haven't seen it, you should and if you have seen it, you should see it again.  And yes, I heard that same story on the radio on the way over here.  The government has mandated that "Put Put Golf" is the official verbal license plate of the "Fucking Asshole Contingency Of The United States Of America" (or FACUSA as it's commonly known).   *  A.F.A.P.; A.S.A.P.; A.M.A.P.; Q.A.S.I.O.I.A.G.T.C.A.H.C.A.Y.O.S.Y.K.  - As Fast as Possible, As Soon As Possible, As Many As Possible, Quit Abbreviating Shit Immediately Or I Am Going To Commit A Heinous Crime Against You Or Someone You Know.

      As some of you know I have an unhealthy amount of music available to me (both stolen and not stolen, but mostly stolen) and I feel it is my need to let everyone know what is good (well at least what is good by my questionable standards).  So every other day or so I will suggest some listening that you should be doing.  Sometimes it may be an album, sometimes just a single track that will enrich your life (yes, even more than frenetic masturbation).  And if at any point anyone wants a copy of any of this stuff, ask me and I shall provide.  Believe me, I'm well aware that nobody here gives a crap, because it's pretty much only friends reading this and we will ignore each other anyway, but what the hell - I have nothing else to do...  1)   The Postal Service - Give Up  (album) Exposed to me by Kid Snickers, this album just gets better every time I listen to it.  It's keyboard driven sullen pop that makes you kind of realize things aren't as bad as they may seem.  2)  Jean Jacques-Perrey & Gershon Kinglsey - The In Sound From Way Out  (album) Remember walking through the mall in the late 70s and early 80s when the music shop had the keyboards blaring cheesy version of modern hits and kooky compositions by the store employees?  Well this stuff is it, along with some themes from t.v. shows and other things that you'll recognize right away.  A very stupid and guilty pleasure, that you MUST like or you're not going to be cool.  3)  Joseph LoDuca - Evil Dead 2 Soundtrack  (album) Jack Black said it best, "Funny movie, awesome soundtrack."  If you don't like this you truly are a cinematic (and musical) idiot.

       The Day Is Done With Minimal Murder   Went to work and talked to the bossman about stizuff, and everything seems to be rounding back into shape.  I was afraid today was the "need to talk" girlfriend break-up thing but it turned out to be another "we're gonna do this and that" session that I've been in for 6 years now.    I wonder if you can get butt cancer from someone blowing smoke up your ass for 6 years?  Anyway, the day is done with 2 out of 4 victories.  The fence is a mild victory in that I don't think it will be tough to get around "the code", SBC backed down and admitted fault, my job is still around (until my boss has another period, settle down it's a dude) and decides it's time to make everyone panic, my traffic ticket is paid and  The Sadmakers * have rescheduled for Friday, so we'll see what happens then.    But just to let me know who's in charge, the fates decided to make the Lakers lose a game they should have won by 20.  So I guess the toal for the day is Me - 3, Jesus - 2.  TAKE THAT JESUS!!   * The Sadmakers  - The Gas Company or any other company that insists on mis-billing their customers and/or tries to destroy their hope of having extra money in a month.

And I was working out on the treadmil at my complex when the same tard that has annoyed me while working out for 6 years walks in and asks if he can change the channel on the tv while I am watching it. I said no and he said how about we watch CNN and I said how about we leave it on VH1's tribute to awesomely bad girls. And he ask what was wrong with CNN and I says I hate to falls asleep on the treadmil and fall off. Me want to punch him. And if you stab someone if they are talking on their cell phone like a loud asshole....that is a fix it ticket right?

Could this be the day that he finally 'fesses up to stringing us along for the last couple months about closing our office?  Could he want to talk to me about letting me work more (or less) than 18 hours a week?  Could he just be using this as a front to go drink beers and bitch about thing he'll never fix?

       The Not-So-Great Fence Debacle   Just got done talking with the city guy who sent us the letter regarding the fence.  I came to find out that this was a personal complaint form "someone" in the area.  Probably the same person that left a little bitchy note about how our dogs bark once in a while when we're at work.  He was very cool (the guy from code enforcement) as I properly inserting tongue into slot "a" with a swift apology for my  Kravitzian * message I left on his machine.  As is my intention with all iffy matters, I began to make him laugh and tried to sway him to the light side, which seemed to have worked quite well.  We're going to go to his office this Friday and talk to him about getting a easement (which the Prisoner so helpfully suggested we do) and getting this whole crapfest finished.  We were told there has been quite a history with fence complaints against this home before we were the owners and that this could be the tail end of some kind of bizarre neighborhood vendetta that we're catching the ass end of.  Anyway, that's one bad thing massaged and taken care of so far.  Now onto The Rape/Gas Company fiasco.  How's yer day comin' along?   * Kravitzian  - A thought or problem that verbally spills out as a consciousless stream of aged bitching and moaning.

      Green is the color of my energy.  At the moment my circle of friends are experiencing some mixes of rather good fortune.  I am genuinely pleased for them all.  For the most part they deserve it, and those that don't aren't wasting time wondering about whether or not they do.  I wish I could be like that.  I'll say it for you.  I'm feeling sorry for myself.    I'm reigning in angry feelings because recently my Jiminy Cricket has pointed out that I have very little to moan about and I should just grow up.  Sadly, it just ain't working for me right now.  On the bright side, Spring arrived on Sunday.  I fixed my brakes (with help) and nobody died.

      So tomorrow morning I have a wonderful visit from the rapists formerly known as  The Gas Company  coming tomorrow to explain to me how they enjoy bending people over and doing them very very hard in their anus because of how good it makes them feel.  Then I get to argue about how cooking once a week and having no other gas appliances can't add up to a $82 bill for a month.  Then  SBC  gets to have me (in an already cheery mood) call them and ask why they're charging me a late fee for a bill they never sent me.  In the midst of that conversation I'm sure they will explain their passion for having their customers scar up their knees while "polishing their collective knob" over the amount of money they charge for inferior services.  Then the "cup duh grass", the city has sent us a letter stating that our fence (that has been up for almost two years and was verbally approved before and during construction by the city's code nazis) now must be moved back 10 feet from the sidewalk.  Why?  I suppose it's because all of the money the city is spending sending the police force out to investigate domestic vandalism (oh wait they never did send a cop out to us when they would have actually been welcomed) is killing their budget so they have to sap money from people somehow.  After my  ringburningly * angry message I left Saturday night on Mr. Ed Roberts machine, I have been unassigned from the fence argument by the lovely wife known as Kate.  (Probably for the better as three arguments in one day with government and pseudo-government officials will probably drive me to killing quicker than expected)  So that's my Monday, coming soon to me in about 8 hours.  I can't wait for that.  Maybe when it's all said and done Hitler, Idi Amin and everyone else who is driven by the excesses of pure evil will come and drink all of liquor so I really have no relief....  * ringburner; ringburning; ringburningly  - anything or anyone that makes your asshole burn like you've eaten nothing but jalapeño juice for the last 20 years.

        Guy likes Pirates!!!  Who knew? If you like pirates, you're ok in my book. If you don't like pirates your a pinko commie. Pirates are so lovable with their wooden legs, eye patches and severed limbs replaced with hooks. They even have monkeys some time.  Here's to the rum chugging scally-wags of  the Seven Seas...  ARRRRRRRGH!!!   I'm really bored. Can I go home yet?

      Who said I hated Bare Naked Ladies?  I'm not a fan but I never said I hated them.  Monkeys are great. Monkeys in clothes, not so great.  I like funny more than serious any day, ask my wife when was the last time we watched a serious movie.  She'll tell you, I'd rather watch a bad comedy than a good drama.   Your info needs to be checked better next time pal.  Don't make me get drunk and beat your ass.   In a funny way of course.    Peace out my brother.  I like pirates too.

      I figured out why Guy doesn't like Barenaked Ladies. It's because they are really funny and put on a great show. Guy doesn't like "Funny". Guy likes "Serious".  Why does Guy hate everything so much? You guys always say I don't like anything. I think Guy beats me in that department by far.  Come on Guy, lighten up buddy. It's ok to like monkeys in clothes, listen to fun music, laugh at movies about retards and eat fruit. You won't lose your serious music edge. We'll all still like you.

        So, it turns out Canadia really does want to be America Junior. I went to the Barenaked Ladies concert at the Universal Ampitheater last night. We got there a little after the opening band had already started and it turns out my curse isn't only for movies. The people behind us were talking non-stop for at least 15 minutes as if nothing else was going on in the theater and I'm sure they started way before we got there.  Luckily I wasn't the one that said something this time. The lady sitting next to them pretty much flipped out. It was pretty sweet. Many expletives were thrown back and forth which almost came to blows being thrown. They loud talkers then looked to us for sympathy for being yelled at when I explained to them that they were being very loud but we agreed perhaps there was a better way to handle the situation.  I then found my proof that Canadians are loud obnoxious assholes. They explained that they were from Canadia (aka. America Jr.) and had been listening to BNL since Jr. High. I guess this gave them the right to act like retarded 4 year olds in front of a group of people. Who knew? The rest of the show they proceeded to explain how lucky us "Americans" were for having such great Canadians show up in our country.  If Canadia is so great why are you here in Amercia, eh? Go home you hockey watchin', moose lovin', maple syrup eating hosers!!!

      So I go to the local Albertson' today to grab a 2 liter of Pepsi to complement my pal Jim Beam while I watch the Lakers whoop up on the bastard basketball stepson clan that is the L.A. Clippers.  When I hit the register the damn checkout communist didn't even say hi, look me in the eye or do anything speical to warrant her 4 months of tireless and pointless bitching about having to pay for insurance she should've been paying for all along.  She handed me my change and said nothing as she turned to her fellow militant whiner to start gabbing about the next pretend problems they will have.  The "scab" (or should I say employees who valued their job and did what they're supposed to) employees were always nice, they did everything they could to make shopping for food (an inherent annoyance in life) a quick and pleasant experience.  They always, at the very least, said thank you when they handed me change from the money I just spent to pay their checks.  Maybe I should start picketing the employees of the grocery industry and moan about what incompetent morons they are and how they might want to do their job they signed on for if they plan on getting compensated for it.  The Lakers won though, so that was nice...

       AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands (Tuesday)  International recording artist Tori Amos was " delighted " and " relieved " to remember where she had left the keys to her car, a 1989 Ford Tempo some 4 years ago. Cameras captured the event as Amos was appearing on The Netherlands' second most popular talk-show,  The Siggy Van Pool Talk and Sing Programme .  " I was just leaving for a tour " said Amos " And when I got back, I couldn't find the keychain anywhere.  I was sure that I'd have to leave the car in the carport at my friend's place.  It was especially disapointing because I left a bunch of my favorite tapes in the trunk ". Immediately after the broadcast, Amos called the United States. "  Kelly! Look in the change dish on the coffee table, under the all the pennies ".  Close friend, Kelly Branderson reported to Amos that the keys were indeed there. " She said there was a half pack of Mentos there too " Amos joked " I remember buying them and thinking they were stale.  I bet they're stale now eh? ".  Later she noted, " I was sure I had looked in that dish before, but y'know I bet I forgot "

      All day at work today I had to call  America's Wang * and lemme tell you (even though I've never been there but will be this June) that the rumors about the Sunshine State being useless to human development are true.  After spending a good 15 minutes of my day explaining the difference and inherent meaning of the words "exterior" and "interior", it seems to me that voting isn't the only thing Floridians have trouble grasping.  Apparently down there they have discovered that their opposable thumbs aren't for using tools, holding various implements of creation/destruction or hitching a ride to anywhere else - - - they are strictly for sitting on.    *  America's Wang  - an all too appropriate term for the not-so-great phallic state of Florida.

         Disneyland, Anaheim California   Saturday, March 13, 2004   Late Saturday night, a fan of the outrageous and sometimes controversial ska band "The Aquabats" saved $2.68 by wearing his favorite Aquabats shirt. As he approached the cash register Mr. Turnbaugh was asked by the cashier if he was an Aquabats fan. Explaining to the woman that the Aquabats were indeed his favorite band lead to an extensive conversation about how both would miss an upcoming concert due to the "Sold Out" status of the tickets. Both were disappointed.  When Mr. Turnbaugh went to pay with his Partners ATM and Check card (The Official Credit Union of the Disney Corporation) the cashier asked if he was still an employee. After explaining that he was not an employee but his father was the cashier gave him the 20% employee discount anyway.   When asked how he felt about the encounter  stunned Mr. Turnbaugh reported, "Who knew wearing my favorite Aquabats shirt would get me a free soda?  THANKS AQUABATS!!!"

      And this is what you all bugged me about?!  First.  I have no clue who most of you people are.  But i recall my old friends being funny, so we must not have met.  Second.  Clearly you have forgotten your roots, as i see a scant 5 (!) uses of my name -- turn it into a curse word, wear it on a teeshirt i dont give a damn, lets show a little god damn respect for those that love you the most!  Third.  Of those i know, many i have not seen in a while... little has changed -- Except for some weird reason I've taken to using the word "faggot" much, much more (tobias, im looking at you).  Guy, sup, how the bambino?  miss you lots.  Andy, take care of that wife, shes a sweet chick.  Is tony or adam even around anymore?  I miss tony's acerbic wit and massively hairy arms.  And Adams apples.  Justin...  im tired of waiting for your kid to turn 16 so that i may finally purchase that corvette and impress all of her friends.  And finally Fourth.  I wish toby's man-jangles would drop and start pumping their fair share of hair seed so that he may discover women.  Because i fear then and only then will we all be spared of these needless rants by the SAC-o-phant.   Later all.  And ah,  oh yes, toby stop being such a faggot.    ps having read all the archive (yeah, I know, aderalls a savior), what the hell did toby do that was such a giant rant off?  And for the record tob, cooling off doesnt mean simply ceasing to SAY youre right and they are wrong.... You have to think it too.

       DAY 9  The saga of Justin's missing shoes is ended.  Earlier today Justin Armao's favorite shoes were found, unharmed and well, behind a door in the bedroom of his apartment. His daughter, Kira, is suspected to have moved the shoes, or at least to have taken part in their disappearance.  So far she has denied involvement and refuses to speak further unless there ice cream sandwiches present. " I'm just glad that I can finally leave the house again " beamed Justin in a press conference today, " Right after I watch TV for a while, I am very seriously thinking about walking out to the mailbox!!  It's been weeks.  But don't hold me to it, theys(sic) havin' a Nash Bridges Marathon on the Superstation, so I might be indisposed.    Good For You, Justin!

      20 Ways to Boost Your Baby's Brain Power By Alice Sterling Honig, Ph.D.  #10. Use BODY MASSAGE to decrease your infant's stress and enhance his feelings of well-being and emotional security. Loving touches promote growth in young babies. Research has shown that premature babies who are massaged three times daily are ready to leave the hospital days earlier than babies who do not receive massages.  Alice Sterling Honig, Ph.D., professor emerita at Syracuse University, is the author, with H. Brophy, of Talking With Your Baby: Family as the First School.

When interviewed Justin regretfully conceded that at some point he may have to consider wearing " the grey ones with the lace-ups " even though he believes " they are more of a hassle ".  Close friend Andy was " reservedly optimistic " that the shoes will be " in the last place you look.  (It)Seems like it's always that way ".  Justin describes the shoes as " brown " and " shoe-like " in shape.

         BOSTON,MA ( TheBostonian )  Vacationing elevator repairman, Thierry Alors-Burgiessé, 38 of France has something special to write on his postcards home.  He's found himself a wife, and at the middle of a controversy.  Alors-Burgiessé has surrendered himself to immigration authorities declaring that he is the spouse of a Siemens MiniBank 2100™ automated teller machine and demanding asylum while he pursues legal residency. Though rare, the union is not unprecedented, in 1974 a Canadian woman claimed to be the wife of a coffee table in Ohio and requested temporary residency.  Her request was declined when it was discovered that the woman was still married to a padded ottoman in Vancouver, BC.  Massachusetts law is unclear on the validity of Alors-Burgiessé's claim and is reviewing legal histories.  However; Sieman's East Coast Service Supervisor, Thomas Gulliven has given the couple  his  blessing after examining the machine for signs of tampering. " The MiniBank™  is  a beauty "  he agrees " I prefer the lines on our new Cash-o-Matic 2601™, myself but have to hand it to the French dude, congratulations and best wishes from all of us at Siemens! ".  The couple is expected to settle in the west corner of the 7-11 market where they first met.

         HOLLYWOOD,CA ( AccessHollywood )  In what can only be described as a stupendous error in judgment, part time television network FOX-TV has  renewed a show that was cancelled over 20 years ago.  Manimal  has been picked up for a full run beginning in the Fall season.  Previous underachievers  24  and  The O.C.  are expected to be displaced to accomodate an unprecedented twice weekly schedule. " Crazy " Jim Wirkuss, Fox-TV's head of development has attributed the move to " Something I did while I was stoned, seriously I was frickin' hammered... I woke up in a dumpster... " and also lamented, " We're paying the black dude a million bucks an episode? his price went way up after Ice Pirates ". Entertainment pundits have declared the bold move a " career ending blunder " and " an idea much much worse than Ally McBeal ". Simon McCorkindale, the show's lead, is allegedly cutting short his national tour of " Falcon's Crest: the musical " to begin filming new episodes.

      I also saw many an article in the mainstream media that pointed out the Zombie theme that runs through these films. Me think New Dawn of Dead is best movie I see in long ass time and is much better than original. I don't like tv newscaster banter it always sucks. Colin Quinn is not so funny. Politicians are dickfaces. Jim Hill is a good solid sportscaster. Oprah is downright Kentucky fried evil. I saw Midget kkk on Jerry Springer but they don't hate blacks they hate tall people. I still don't have a cell phone but it seams like more and more people are shocked that i don't have one I think I am weird. Tapatio is good stuff.

       Oklahoma City, OK ( AP/Saturday )  Saturday's BigLotto™ drawing has sparked controversy and accusations from Mrs. Floreen Hasker, 58 of Green Biscuit, a suburb of Oklahoma City. " Until they get those balls looked at, count me out " she declared in an op/ed piece in Green Biscuit's local newspaper. " If I could buy a ticket with just the number eleven on it, well I'd be a wealthy woman " she said in a telephone interview on Friday, " and I'm not a wealthy woman ". Hasker believes that the number eleven comes up with "alarming regularity" and is the main reason she is calling for a full and thorough investigation. Oklahoma's State Lottery Comissioner, Mañuel Cipequa replied to Hasker in an op/ed piece due for publication tomorrow. "There is no statistical evidence that the number eleven is a winning number in any disproportional manner.  Furthermore there is no evidence that five and eight get 'jew-ed' as Mrs. Hasker has claimed in previous communications." In 1997 Mrs. Hasker suggested that the number system be scrapped entirely and replaced with a letter based system so that winning " words would be drawn instead of numbers.  That would really help our schools.  Maybe words like 'booger' would come up and Jay Leno would do a little bit about it on his show ". Comissioner Cipequa declined to comment on that subject, but said the state had no plans to change the operation of the state's lottery.

         COLUMBUS, OH  Friends and co-workers of Daniel Beckitt, 33 of Machewicca are " apalled " and " disturbed " by the new " All-business " haircut sported by Beckitt at a recent inter-departmental mixer. " It's a put-on " said Office Supervisor Marjory McKeen " This 'slick and trim' new do makes him look like management material, but it must be the hair talking because his annual review clearly did not indicate that a push upstairs was in order ". Last Summer Beckitt was spotted wearing a " ridiculous Atlanta Braves baseball cap " in the office until McKeen reminded him that it was a violation of the companies dress code  " Besides, who wears a Braves hat in Columbus?  I ask you " added McKeen who notes that she has " an Indians sticker on my Tercel, and I always will thank-you very much ". Co-worker, Gregory Poole remarked " I like Danny and all, but that haircut makes him look like a tool ", but was not aware of the baseball cap incident as it took place during his vacation to Hilton Head, SC. Beckitt could not be reached for comment due to a scheduled podiatrist appointment.

       HOLLYWOOD ( Monday ) Janice Watson and Tom Corrington, the last successful "Love Connection" couple from the 80's dating show of the same name, have finally split after " all kinds of shenanigans " reports a source close to the couple. Originally meeting in 1992 the couple enjoyed a ' wonderful ' and ' really special ' evening at the Chili's Restaurant in Burbank, courtesy of the shows producers. In recent years, Tom experienced several professional setbacks that placed stress on the couple's relationship.  Janice owns a successful Aroma Therapy clinic in the San Fernando Valley. " We tried to get them back for a prime-time reunion special about 8 months ago " said the shows host Chuck Woolery, "but you could just tell that they were not as close as they had once been " The couple were never married and in a recent interview admitted to only actually seeing each other ' every few months ' when Tom's business brought him to the West Coast from his home in St. Petersburg FL. They have agreed to share the lifetime supply of Rice-a-Roni that they received after the their appearance on the show.  However the Conair TravelMate™ hairdryer was lost in 1996 and there are no plans for replacement or compensation.

      INT. BATHROOM - DAY Toby pulls his toiletries bad from a larger duffle bag spilling clothes.  He takes out a toothbrush and toothpaste tube. There is KNOCK, KNOCK at the DOOR.  VOICE (woman's)  "Hello? Steve...?"  TOBY  "Uh, no... sorry."  VOICE  "Ahh, who's that?"  TOBY  "Toby"  VOICE  "What are you doing in there?"  TOBY  "Uh, I was.."  VOICE  "You're not supposed to use that bathroom,  it's a private bathroom.  You're not supposed to use it."  TOBY  "I, uh, I have a key.  I got a key from the landlord"  VOICE  "I don't understand why he gave you one.   That's a private bathroom"  TOBY  "I guess I need to talk to him then"  VOICE  "I guess so, because that's a private bathroom"    Toby looks at the door.  If he had x-ray vision he would see that the voice's owner has not left.  He does not have x-ray vision.   TOBY  "So, I guess I need to talk to the landlord, then..."  VOICE  "I don't know why you'd have a key.   You shouldn't be in there... It's a private bathroom"    A pause.  Again, Toby attempts to use his x-ray vision, to no avail.   TOBY  "I'll be right out, I don't have any pants on"    This is a lie, Toby does have pants on, but no shirt.  The VOICE does not answer.   TOBY  "So I'm gonna need a minute or two"    If Toby  did  have x-ray vision, he would see that the owner of the voice had left.  Moments later, Toby LEAVES.

         The OC -    Local fixture, Justin ' Pimples ' Armao, recently contacted a few long-time friends to inform them that from now on he would like his nickname to be ' Boots ' or ' Bootsie '.    This change was prompted by his recent 'run-in' with losing his shoes.  Pundit, Andy ' The Neck ' Cauble, was dubious that the new nickname would stick, " He's always been 'Pimples' as long as I've known him.  I don't see that changing just from a moment or two in the spotlight ".  Consumer, Jason ' Spanks ' Turnbaugh, was divided, " If I could, I'd change  my  nickname in an instant, but I don't think you can pick your own... I think there's a rule about it?  Maybe in the bible? ".   Friend, Craig ' Craig ' Underwood, is undecided about the new moniker, " I'll use it if someone else does... I got burned when he wanted everyone to call him ' Viktor ' in high school.  I looked a right bumberclod. "  Justin did briefly change his name legally in 1988 to ' Rockmeister Armao Von Goldenmane'  while performing with local metal band ' The Chrome Dogz ' but changed it back three months later.

       "I'm rick james '  bitch!"    brent, you forgot to add the  possessionary  apostrophe.  this is a very common grammatical error, which probably occcured as a result of some minor finger slippage while using your computer ' s keyboard.   Note to everyone:  minor finger slippage is the number one cause of common grammatical errors, and is NOT a known side effect of  adderall ,  adderall RX , or the generic  amphetamine mixed salts .   for more information, please refer to the following off-site  urlLink link .

      You're right.  But why would i need a prescription when jenny malm has one -- it says so right here on the bottle.  See, she gets them and sells them to some lovely man in a black coat, thus saving me the hassle of all that pesky doctorin and putting gas in the car to get down to the pharmacy... you know its really just a simple cost/benifit analysis, i can graph it for you if you need.  Plus, we can all accept i need pills of some kind, i figure im just going to keep trying different ones until the right fit!

      it is spelled '  adderall  ' - which you would know if you'd ever had a prescription for it, or it wasn't in a bottle labled "  Happy Head Pills  ".  For the unitiated, '  adderall  ' is a prescription medication for sufferers of ADHD, or whatever they are calling it this week.  It is the NEW '  Ritalin  ', but intended for slightly older patients ( and college students looking to augment their study techniques ).  Judging from Brent's rant, it doesn't work too well.

      As I travel during an exciting weekend of shows with the Ataris we got to experience thunderstorms! You know, rain, the thing that people in CA and AZ just can't comprehend and because of this we all run indoors to avoid melting.  Because of the wet stuff, I got to hang out on the I-10 towards Phoenix for a couple of hours while a turned over truck full of bottled water was eventually shoved off the road and then I got to drive once again.  Now that it's around 7am, I'm feeling a bit tired and now get to look forward to minimal sleep before a festival show later that day.  Of course, "the rain" started falling out of the sky and the show was cancelled.  How wonderful! I can grab a nap and go out for some fun later that night.  No, that wouldn't be the case. We set up a show indoors so that we don't all melt in the rain.  Oh yeah, all this on about two hrs of sleep.  We all know  that "Sleeping is for Fags".  With this knowledge, I drink all the Redbull in sight and it's time for a big rock show.  The show goes off just fine, the kids go mad for it, circle pits, slam dancing, crowd surfing and all that fun stuff. Now it's back to the hotel that I've been jonesing for the entire day to get a little shut-eye.  I have an early morning flight that requires me to be in the lobby at 6am.  The Super Shuttle guy arrives late, and I get to ride to the airport in a  big blue van with huge yellow writing (I know how to travel in style). Then comes the usual airport security and fun that we all love with our HOMELAND SECURITY.  Check in, head to gate, strip down to the basics (no metal objects of course) and put everything into little tubs to travel thru x-ray.  Then the front line security guy says "removing your shoes  may'  reduce your chance of extra screening".  I, lacking sleep and being stubborn don't remove my shoes and continue thru the metal detector.  No alarms go off and I head over to get my stuff spread out in various tubs.  Result, I'm thru and on my way to the gate.  Not so. Mr. TSA says "Please step to the side for extra screening". "Did I set off the Alarm?" "No" (as he's staring at my Vans) To me, no alarm=no more hassles.  Not the case.  I guess shoes just can't be worn thru security checkpoints in Phoenix.  After my extensive search with the metal detecting wand (didn't I just walk thru a larger version of this?).  Mr. TSA found all of my piercings and even a couple of buttons on my shorts and nothing around my shoes, which I never took off during the extra screening.  Wasn't this the point of extra screening, to see if I was carrying a bomb, gun, box cutter, ginsu knife, leggos, or some weapon that'll take down a plane.  After all this, I got onto my flight with screaming children.  Oh, the sweet sound of music. Lesson learned: Become one of the mindless fools thru security checkpoints and you'll have less run-ins with Mr. TSA.  Or, just walk thu wearing only your underwear and no shoes.  I think I'll only wear my undies next time.  Just make sure that they're clean, you know that mom would be proud.

       Andy, Toby, Brent and I went to an art show at a comic book store in LA this weekend. It was for an artist named Ragnar. You can see his stuff ar  urlLink www.LittleCartoons.com .  If I had remebered to bring my camera with me there would be a picture of Jack Black looking rather annoyed when Brent asked to shake his hand.  Sometimes meeting stars is bad because they turn out to not be as cool as you think they are. I'm going to pretend Jables just hates Brent as much as the rest of us do.

      From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this:  What Makes 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%.  How about achieving 103%? What makes up 100% in life?  Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:  If: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z is represented as: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26.  Then:  H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K 8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%  and  K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%  But,  A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E 1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%  And,  B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T 2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%  AND, look how far ass kissing will take you.  A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G 1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%  So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that While Hard work and knowledge will get you close, and, Attitude will get you there, Bullshit and Ass kissing will put you over the top.

      This is not an onion-styled story, this is real.   urlLink Fat Jerk Gets Kicked Out Of All-You-Can-Cram-In-Your-Hole    I'm not the low-carb hater that our buddy Jason is,  but this story offends me in the biggest way.  If you read it you will find that the protagonists,  Isabelle Leota, 29 , and her husband  Sui Amaama, 26,  went to some filthy little buffet restaurant, dropped $8.99 and stuffed their faces with roast beef.  Eventually the manager had to eject them ( I expect he needed a spotter to do this ) but this was after Sui, ( who shares his name with the love call of a pig ) had returned to the buffet table for the 12th time.  Read that again  THE 12TH TIME?  Sui, you fat bastard, step away from the platter and go kill yourself.  After being asked to get the @#$% out, Sui and his porcine partner complained, " But this is an All-You-Can-Eat Restaurant ".   From what I hear Sui was chewing sticks of butter as he spoke.  If Doctor Atkins wasn't already dead wouldn't the egregious excesses being performed in his name clog up his arteries like a Nacho Cheese Triple Thick Milkshake?  How can anyone got back to the buffet for  11  times and think that  1 more trip  will be within their diet plan's constraints?   12 of anything means you are not on a diet!!   Now I'm going to   urlLink Subway™   to delude myself that eating fresh will make the pounds fall off.   toby

      Ok, this is where Toby outs himself as a bit of a conspracy theory nutcase.  For some time we've been giving out our personal 'marketing' information to various organizations for a myriad of reasons.  Supermarket Club Cards are a perfect example,  Ralphs  knows how often I buy sodas ( every couple of weeks ), and what kind ( Diet Pepsi ) and from where ( Yorba Linda, CA ) and at what time ( Tuesday afternoon, about 1:30 ).  This is perfectly harmless information, only of any real use to the marketing folks who build a model of me based on my buying habits.  They know that a discount on Diet Pepsis will probably get me to buy more Cheez-its ( I usually buy them at the same time ).  You might be thinking, big deal, who cares or Wow, Toby packs carbs like a marathon runner.  This information is interesting to some people but not really important right?  Read on.    Late last year I bought 2 six packs of Smirnoff Ice Triple Black from a Stater Brothers in Costa Mesa, CA.  At the check out the cashier asked to see my ID (I was flattered) and then typed something into the register as she slid the drinkies along the conveyor belt ( along with more Cheez-its ).  I asked her what she had typed in to the compter and she told me, " Your license number " " Why do you need my license number? ", I asked " It's just so the computer knows I checked your ID ." she replied " It's okay ".  First off, it's not okay, second... who gets to review that list of license numbers?  As you can see, suddenly my marketing history is a little more interesting, if I had been pulled over that evening, a friendly Orange County Patrolman ( they are ALL friendly ) might've asked if I'd had anything to drink that evening.  I would have answered honestly that I had not.  The friendly Patrolman would then run my license ( just in case I have a warrant for those expired tags ) and along with my clean driving history, he MIGHT've gotten a little notice that I had bought some liquor just a few hours before.  Far fetched? maybe.  Or so I thought...   urlLink This article  covers a new practice in Missouri.  Now the Missouri Office of State Courts Administrator is hiring a private company to compare outstanding debts owed by "scofflaws" to pizza delivery lists.  The hook is that "scofflaws" might give false info to the state when it comes to an unpaid ticket or pet license, but you can bet your butt that Dominos knows where you live, what your phone number is, and how many Hot Wings™ you can cram in your Atkins loving gullet.  This scares the crap out of me.  Pattern recognition, data mining, ( and a whole bunch of other buzzwords that you skipped over when you read that copy of Wired in the john a couple years ago ) is real, viable, and happening now.  You may not already know this but prospective employers will run your credit report as part of the screening process, what are they looking for?    Your fondness for shopping at Best Buy, your steady purchase of online pornography, your huge amount of unsecured debt?  What does that do to your chances of getting the job?  Will they offer you less money because they smell your desperation?  My biggest concern is that private companies are now combining databases ( including information collected by government agencies ) and building a very vivid model of you, and me.   Private companies have access to goverment databases?  The DMV can't keep track of where I live AND where my car is registered, but some private company has that info plus the rundown of what I buy from Foot Locker?  The potential is staggering.   Then someone else uses this merged database to make decisions about you, and me.  What if a pack of Marlboros from a Vons purchased for someone else negates you getting non-smoker rates for health insurance ( as if you could afford it anyway )?  Or the fact that I display brand loyalty to Diet Pepsi means that the bluetooth enabled Pepsi machines up the price by 20¢ as soon as I'm within 20 feet?  These may be the most innocuous applications of the data.  My concern is that I have no idea who has that data and what data are they merging it with, for someone else.  From the article  " Michael Daniels, an ACS division vice president, declined to reveal exactly which companies' databases ACS uses. "  Ahh yes privacy.  I wish I had that luxury.    toby

      Yes, I know that much to the chagrin or delight of most people around the world I have been far too absent from the Smart Patrol blog.  Well, I have now decided to document my incredible lack of activity in the world again, here at the home of the deadly but pretty Smart Patrol.    What have I been up to recently?  First off, I have been conducting an experiment in finding out just how long I can remain in the clothes I slept in before I have t ogo to my "more exciting than ever" job.  (The record currently stands at 8:30 a.m. until 3:30 p.m.)  I have also been sitting at our dining room table dealing four hands of Texas Hold 'Em to myself and imaginary oppponents.  The best part of this being that it is like gambling without all the fun and the money.  Wait, I meant the worst part.  By the way, I won for the first time only two nights ago.  I have also continued to rape the record industry of their profits (partly out of anger at the prices for medicore to crappy music nowadays and partly because, well - it's free) and have bolstered my music collection to a healthy amount that I shouldn't mention here on the off chance that someone from the RIAA is either reading my posst or monitoring my brain (via the implant I recently discovered embedded in my left shoulder, but I digress...)  Due to the amount of heat that that bastard God has decided to dole out to us humans recently, I have also been sitting directly under any fan I can find or sitting in my A/C'd car for unhealthy amounts of time.  Other than that, I've been doing nothing but waking, drawing, working and coming home to watch American Chopper reruns.  Anyway, I hereby promise to post more often and quit ignoring my duties to the well being of The Smart Patrol.

      When that dog ran away did you find him up on cinder blocks with the bottom half of his legs stolen? If you are choosing between Parker and Rod it is really just a which name is less queer contest.

      Hey Kids,   This is my new buddy "Parker" aka "Rod". I rescued him from the ASPCA animal shelter in Huntington Beach on Saturday. He is a 3 year old Corgi/Chow mix who may have belonged to a homeless person at some point. I thought "Rod" was a stupid name for a dog and apparently he does too because he never responds when you say it. I'm not sure where Parker came from it just seems to fit though. It makes me think of the old TV show "Parker Lewis Can't Lose" and/or Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker. So, you can take your pick on which one you would rather relate the name to.   He's been a really nice dog so far. He doesn't bark. He hasn't tried to "GO" in the house. He likes being where ever the people are and want's his head or belly rubbed. Or he'll go sit out on the side porch and watch all the other dogs and people go by. He did escape for about an hour and a half Saturday night. After being lethargic and slow for most of the day he decided to show us how fast he was by running past Tony as he left the apartment. After we had given up looking for him Toby found him relaxing on somebody's front porch waiting for them to let him in. I hope he just got confused as to which house is his. They do all look the same especially from eight inches off the ground.  Parker is having his manhood removed today as mandated by state law. I'm sure every male reading this feels for him but it sure will be funny if he comes home with a big cone on his head. (Should this happen, pictures will be posted later.) I'm gonna take him to get registered and chipped later this week. Tony and I were hoping we could get Lojack or some kind of WiFi installed for tracking purposes later. I'll have to look into that. For now, we will just have to tighten up security on the Turnbaugh compound.   urlLink For more pictures of Parker check my Hiplog.

      As part of an assignment to assist in the completion of his GED, PFC Norris  " The Rooster "  Cahern  sends us an unfiltered and brutally honest account of his exploits serving in Iraq.  WARNING: MAY CONTAIN ADULT LANGUAGE, BAD SPELLING AND EXCESSIVE USE OF THE WORD " DUDE ".      Dude, get this I am totally in Iraq right now, for reals.  Dude it is hot here and the people don't know how to speak or nothing like that.  They wave at us and stuff, sometimes they tell us stuff, they talk to this dude named Chris who is from St. Louis and he speaks there language, which I think is call farty, dude I'm not kidding, farty. So this Chris dude, he's all like " we gotta go get these guys " and I'm all like " No duh " and he's all giving me the stink eye and I'm all like " Face! bro ".  We have laughs like that all the time. You can't get Molson Golden here, which sucks. Dude, so one time we were getting all shot at stuff, and I'm all like " Whoa, this sucks " and then these Italian soldiers show up and so I'm like " Mamma Mia, this sucks " right?  Well, they didn't know what I was saying, cause they don't have TV in Rome (where the bread is from). The girls here cover up their faces, I guess they need to. I gotta go, we have an Iraqui prinsoner and we're taking it in turns to do impressions of him.  I just pretend he's the guy from the Simpsons and we get a big laugh out of that.

      Well this Thursday (a.k.a. - tomorrow) the Altrusitic Puma just may have a giant (well maybe medium to smallish medium sized) surprise in store for all, or at least most, of those who attend.  I will try my best to get there for a little bit.  (Ya see the Laker game is on, a very important playoff one at that, and I have to pick my good lady wife up after work because of car problemos)  Otherwise, I have been up to jack and squat.  Mostly squat due to something very bad that has since ran through my belly, into the toilet, then floating aimlessly somewhere around the Huntington Beach Waste Facility and coming soon to a small innocent toddler bathing in the ocean's dirty bad water near you.  So anyway, come this Thursday y'all, and you too may (if I have enough) come across a free gift.  And no, it's not a trampoline and/or a sailboat, but it could be made into one - hmmmm???

      My stomach is now a pussy.  No matter what I eat lately, it always comes blairing out in this torrent of horrendous splendor not but an hour later.  What has happened to my once hearty innards?  Could it be that I am intolerant of all food?  Sure, it's a great weight loss plan, but a hell of a bummer way to go about life.  Anyway, I just got back from my Best Buy For Business survey thingy this morning.  It wasn't all that bad (a decent free breakfast was there, eggs, fruit, chao mai meatballs, danishes, water, juice, etc.).  The best part of the whole deal being that I walked out with a $150 gift card to Best Buy for my lack of efforts.  It's very ironic that I got the call to do this instead of Heckdude. Considering Heckdude spends nearly the GNP of Sumatra there every year and he never got a call to do this, I feel incredibly gifted (moreso than normal).  And all I had to do to earn this privlege was fake that I have a small business.  What a country!!!  (I immediately apologize for drudging up the memory of Yakov Smirnov for everyone, that was uncalled for, my bad)  So here I sit with my gift card wondering just what (especially since Best Bought doesn't sell any kind of replacement stomach lining, at least no brands that I'm familiar with) to get with it.  Maybe an iPod, maybe a T.V. for our guest room, maybe a DVD burner for compy, maybe a side of beef jerky, the options are endless.  That's what 's going on with my life today, how 'bout you?  Secrest out....

      The good folks at  urlLink  Blogger  have  added some new and exciting features to their already pretty good  service.  Some will be implemented immediately (such as comments!) others will be  studied and considered.   If people get kinda retarded with the  comments then we'll probably turn that off.  Also if it gets clogged up  with viagra and cialis ads then it will certainly get yanked. One feature that I think is very exciting (I sound very phony) is  posting by e-mail.  Go to  urlLink  Blogger   to set up your account to post via e-mail.  This post was sent via e-mail.  Now posts can be sent from your phone,  or anywhere you can send e-mail.

      This is an excerpt from a little something I'm working on based on my experinces on " The Project ".  It's a little out of context but I thought the lessons I've recently learned might be well worth sharing , feel free to steal them or add to them.  Or you can just write them off as the babblings of a nut.  ...it's not all negative, this experience has taught me a lot.    1. Anger has to be managed, it doesn't just wear off or dissipate like my deodorant.  Anger happens, and I'm sure it happens to everybody, how you manage it is what separates you from the animals.    2. I've learned that I can still learn ( duh? ) that I can develop new skills and take pleasure in knowing more at seven P.M. than I did at nine A.M.    3. I've learned that you can be friends with clients, but clients are not your friends.    4. I've learned that all the crap you pull on people everyday is being pulled on you too ( probably by the same people ).  Once you accept that, you should want to cut down on the crap considerably.   5. I've learned that honesty really is a great policy, but sometimes being honest with people just convinces them that you are up to something.  It isn't your fault, like respect, you have to  give  trust to someone  before  they can earn it.  6. I've learned that quality takes time, usually more time than you originally thought ( or budgeted for ).  How you handle that, defines who you are as a professional and as an individual.   I hope this doesn't read as too arrogant or in any way pompous ( the title is meant to be a bit of a joke ).

          REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA, (AP)  Sergei Booblebelli is the proud papa of Georgia's  biggest  little citizen.  Blobski Booblebelli tips the scales at a robust 55 pounds but is only 15 months old, and the family couldn't be happier. " That's my boy " said Sergei, 35 an unemployed electrician and amateur comedian. During the cold war, Soviet scientists had worked in secret on a 'super-sized soldier' program rumored to be based on the American 'Super Soldier Project' that yielded Captain America and The Chippendale Dancers.  The Soviets abandoned their program in the mid-70's with few successes and several crushing failures, namely Yakov Smirnoff and Cousin Balky from ABC-TV's 'Perfect Strangers'.  " I was one of the super-babies " brags Sergei, one of the last of the experiment's subjects, " I am normal, but my boy he is a whopper.  In America you can go to Burger King and get a Whopper™, but in Russia, Burger King comes to your house and empties your refrigerator... what a country! "   Pentagon scientist Ernest Goodfoote refuted Booblebelli's claims and declared that Blobski is in fact a 27 year-old obese midget from Kiev.  " These reds, they try this bunk all the time " said Goodfoote in a telephone interview, " Now, sure they got a lead on us as far as  midgets  go, but the US is second to none in fat baby technology... Second to none!! ".  Little Blobski seems to have no 'super' powers at this time but, according to his father, can make an entire turkey drumstick disappear in under thirty seconds.

      I have recently returned from a venture into America's Wang (Florida) and all in all it wasn't that bad.  The worst part was the 90 to 95 degree weather in the midst of lightning/rain storms and the curiously large amount of dim-witted people.  It's no wonder that these guys couldn't figure out how to work a hole puncher in the last election.  Other than that, it was a fine time had by me and my good lady wife.  It was good to get away from the rut for a bit and reset the brain in a pool while drinking.  So now we're back for another round of finding a way to make our millions and separate ourselves from the grind.  Someday, hopefully, we can find a way to pay bills as soon as they arrive.

Once in a great while, I can win a movie triva contest, as in the great "Seventh Sign/Seventh Seal" debate and the "John Malkovich In Silence Of The Lambs" debacle.

Not yet five, he can hold 7lbs weights with arms extended, something many adults cannot do. He has muscles twice the size of other children his age and half their body fat.  DNA testing showed why: the boy has a genetic mutation that boosts muscle growth.  The discovery, reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, marks the first documented human case of such a mutation.    Steve Rogers is our only hope.

        In what should come as a complete surprise to no one, the Los Angeles Police Department finds itself at the doorway of another scandal.  News affiliates would love to hype this as  Rodney King II: Electric Boogaloo , but the sorry fact is that no matter how offensive the act was, no matter how over-the-top the officer reacted... the viewing audience just collectively sighs and says " Again? ", not out of shock or disgust, just out of not looking forward to the irritation and mess to follow.  Self appointed 'figures in the community' are already clamoring for camera time and dusting off the speeches that they didn't get around to reading back in 1992. Those of us with a pretty good memory will recall that not a whole lot has changed since the last go around.  Those of us with not-so-good memories might want to check out "April 29th 1992" by Sublime.  I will be at Circuit City waiting to pick up my free TV.  If the revolution is televised then I'll be sure and wave to the camera.

        PHOTO: Benji Hottencourt is just one of the Orange County's 'special needs folks' invited to an exciting computer display at the county fairgrounds this week. " I don't know what this other stuff is for ", admitted Hottencourt, 26 " but it's not wall-to-wall boobs like my brother said it was ".  Later Hottencourt was overheard saying he was impressed by " all the cool stuff, but the boob thing was kind of a letdown ".

      That beating women up is more than likely a bad thing right?  But is it alright for us to beat the living shit/holy hell/snot out of these freakishly domineering Pageant Moms?  These oddities of humanity need to be seriously (and preferrably physically) hurt.  Just thought I'd ask.

        Close personal friend of Smart Patrol's own Justin Armao ( and reasonably successful actor ) Marlon Brando died today of congestive heart failure. He will be sorely missed by Justin who has called Brando his friend since an 'all-too-brief' encounter on the set of  Don Juan DeMarco  in 1991. " If only it was Marlon  Wayans  who had died ", said a source close to the Armao family when asked for comment.

        There's this green Camaro that parks at my place.  Last night the driver had parked across one-and-a-half spaces, leaving no space for me.  I had to put my car outside the protective gates of the bunker's compound.  All night I was worried that someone was gonna break in and steal my stereo (the first decent car stereo that I have EVER owned).  I was lucky and nothing happened.  However, green Camaro is my sworn enemy, I'm taking him down.

      Nothing extremely good happened, nothing bad whatsoever.    It's been a day, and for that I'm thankful.  And now I sit here wandering the internet looking for news of the outisde world.  Something to let me know that others too are having days.  Jelly-filled days of excitement and wonder.  I read through some poetry I wrote when I was in high school.  I was smart at one point, what happened?  "Everything was going great until Jesus made me fubmble."

        Why didn't we think of this?  Did I ever tell you how Adam and I had the idea for  urlLink  Cafe Press   WAY before they came out.  But would anyone listen, NO.  You all laughed.  You all laughed like this...  HA!  I hope you are all happy with yourselves.  Here I am practically destitute and these  urlLink  Cafe Press   jokers are laughing all the way to the bank.  Don't even get me started on how I came up with the  urlLink P'Zone�...      Only mine was called  The Floppizza�    Damn you Pizza Hut, damn you to hell!!  I need a rest.

      VOTE!  I know how a GREAT many of  YOU feel. This is just a nagging reminder to you my friends… Talk – Action = ZERO! Have you registered yet? Voicing your opinion, wearing t- shirts, stickers, passing out fliers etc... is all great but  means absolutely NOTHING is you don’t register and vote. It’s  that simple. PLEASE, no matter who you plan on voting for, go  out TODAY and register. Go to your local post office and do it.  It’s is so important. Especially in this election. Think about  the many THOUSANDS of people who died for you, me, your family,  friends and countless others protecting our right to vote.  Sound corny?  No, it doesn’t.  It’s the least we can do to  remember them….  -Dr. Strange newsletter.

       August Meadows, MD - Caryn Musgraves acting President for Girl Scouts of America (GSA) unveiled their latest " tool in fighting the good fight " at a pre-Jamboree " Cookie Strategy Meeting " yesterday.     " For too long, the collection process has been hampered by deadbeats " Musgrave announced in a closed-door " No Weeblos or boyz " [sic] meeting with inner circle members of the organization.     " Nobody stiffs  me  again " bragged Amy Rossman-Peete, the 13-year-old " Poster Girl " for the new program who was involved in an incident last year, where a man who had ordered several boxes of the mint chip cookies flatly " refused to pay for them and then stole and the them anyway ".  All firearms are on indefinate loan from the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) who instituted a similar program last year to keep gay scouts out of the organization.

      I'm a big fan of civil liberty.  Chances are this really stems from a healthy amount ( is there a healthy amount? ) of paranoia that I've been carting around with me for some time.  In recognition of this I am slightly hesitant to post a  urlLink link  to the  urlLink ACLU .   urlLink The American Cilvil Liberties Union  has been pretty effectively marginalized by the  urlLink 'powers that be'  as a bit of a wack-job think tank, but  urlLink this link  at the very least plays a funny little flash movie that illustrates concerns I've had for some time.    Bite into a slice of freedom!

       	 		 		 Has it been two years already?  Amazing how quickly time flies.  The Smart Patrol is overjoyed to congratulate the happy couple on this most auspcious occasion.  Incidentally, Adam received a  urlLink new iPod  for his anniversary, so we wish him much happiness.  However, since I actually performed the stinking ceremony and everything, you'd think I would've scored an iPod or something too.

      Photos to follow, but for now.  Here is the transcipt.  After the ceremony, if you can wait that long, I invite you to mingle around the reception and meet your new friends because a wedding is a new beginning, a new start, for eveyone in attendance.unfortunately, not everyone who we would like to see here today couls be here. Shawn and Marisa would like to mention Grandpa Vlasak, and Grandma Tomlinson who are at home in Wisconsin and couldn't make the trip. They would also like to mention Nana and Paka Tomaselli, and Grandpa Tomlinson who are no longer with us, but I'm sure that they are all here in spirit, if not in person.  This is of course all the more reason why those of you here today, Those of US who are here today, should feel very lucky, very special to be here. After all WE are the people that shawn and marisa have chosen to witness this special event, this very special day in their lives. Our invitations are the gifts that THEY give US. An invitation to share with them the beginning of a journey. We thank them for this gift and it is customary to respond with gifts ourselves. Now if you brought a gift for them today, thats great, I'm sure that they will appreciate it and send along a thank you card very soon. However, I'd like to suggest another gift, and extra gift that many of you can give this couple.  The dictionary has several definitions for the word 'marriage' and while they were all... pretty good "Marriage is properly the act which unites the two parties, and matrimony the state into which they enter. Marriage is, however, often used for the state as well as the act. Wedlock is the old Anglo-Saxon term for matrimony." which as we can all agree is... confusing. it is easy to see why marriage is a scary undertaking, there is a lack of really useful reference information. Except of course, right here today. here we have a library of information, each couple here today has forged their own definition of marriage, what it means and what is doesn't mean, and for every married couple here today, I'll bet the definitions are different and unique. The extra gift that I would ask from you all here today is that you share your definition with the bride and groom. and because this is a special day for them... they have to listen to you, hopefully after today they will be smart enough to listen to you, but for today at least, they have to.Think of this an oppotunity to share all the "if I knew then what I know nows..." with shawn and marisa, I know that they will appreciate it down the road. and one day they will share their definition of marriage with others, keeping the tradition alive.There are many traditions in the ceremony of a wedding, at this time i'd like to ask the best man and the maid of honor to present the rings to the bride and groom.  (bride and groom take rings and put them on)  The ring has been used in wedding ceremonies as far back as ancient egypt. back then it was often a ring made of bone, leather or even papyrus that grew by the shores of the nile. the ring was symbolic to the ancient egyptians, as it is today, a symbol of eternity, without a beginning or an end, and worn on the third finger of the left hand because it was believed that the finger contained a vein that ran straight to the heart. It is not difficult therefore, to see how the ring and the gift of a ring began to be associated with love, in the hope that this most worthy of emotions could take on the characteristics of the circle and capture eternity.along with the exchanging of rings it is traditional to exchange vows. and that is where we are now. The vows are a public declaration of devotion and the contract that these two people have agreed to undertake.  (to Marisa) do you Marisa take Shawn to be your lawfully wedded husband, to stand at his side as his partner through life, giving him your support,strength, guidance, and love. accepting support, strength, guidance and love from him, even when you know you're right and he's wrong? (i do)  (to Shawn) do you Shawn take Marisa to be your lawfully wedded wife, to stand at her side as her partner through life, giving her your support,strength, guidance, and love. accepting support, strength, guidance and love from her, even when you know you're right and she's wrong?(i do)  well, okay - you guys promised, everyone heard you.ladies and gentlemen, it is my extreme pleasure to be the first person to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Shawn and Marisa Tomlinson...Shawn, you may NOW kiss the bride.  (lead applause if necessary)  ladies and gentlemen, please join the bride and groom inside for cocktails and hors d'oevres.
