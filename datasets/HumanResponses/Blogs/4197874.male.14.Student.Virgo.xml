      My first day at school...  I walked in and a lot of people hugged me and then i walked to my locker threw my stuff inside and went to find more people. After i was done messing around we had an asslembly and the teachers all ran in when they were announced and we all laughed at them and then i went to English class and the teacher was mean and stupid so i just kinda sat there and took tests. After that it was Gym class and most of the people didn't bring clothes so we all just kinda ran around in circles for 80 minutes. After that was lunch and i was dying of hunger so i went down that and cut in front of all the freshmen to get in line and they were telling me i couldn't but i just went  :big: and stood there talking to a couple people. We went out through the door and got our salad dressing and then walked to our table to find it was full and so we all had to go cram around this little table and it really sucked :-\ After lunch we had homeroom and me and 4 other friends just sat there playing mad libs while the other people were all chatting and it was hilarious because one person chose bacon and one part rhymed with awaken bacon :XD After homeroom i stayed in the room because it was my next class  :3nod: and basically we just kinda sat there and took notes and stuff and he told us we were going to have a quiz every day and we have one next class already but it is on the rules of the class which i don't even have to look over :XD ... After that we had Drafting (arcitecture class) and he taught us how to make letter so i felt like i was in advanced Pre- School and i just kinda sat there and watched the other people work because i didn't have any of my stuff but i have all next class to work on it all :3nod: And then the day was over and i went home and ate and slept  :XD  (yes i typed this up on gaia and just sent the whole thing over to here) >.>;;

       I forgot to post in here last night a lot of things were going on and i just made an oopsie XD Well last night i made a quest thread for my neverending wishlist and i guess it's going alright considering i haven't bumped in that barely at all XP... Today i spent most of it getting my sig ready to be mapped with help from Meky because i would have been lost if it weren't for her... i finished a good and i am about 4/15 of the way through the next one :3 and i will be "reading" more >.>;; My dad is really gunna kill me with this whole thing he is like "you need to read" everytime he sees me and this morning he said that and i was reading XD... Well i really haven't done anything other than been on Gaia and reading nothing going on with friends because i kinda got grounded.... i dunno how it works but i just kinda told myslef i was so that i would get my books read and guess what IT'S WORKING.. kids out there who are having troubles with patients and stuff while reading ground yourself :3 i read about 100 pages just this morning ^_^ ... alright i just got really confused a little yellow bubble just keeps poping up on my computer telling me something curupted and i don't know but words that end in rupted aren't very reassuring.. OHH!! and another thing i still haven't slept since yesterday i think this is the longest i have gone all summer so.. uh... w00t well i guess this covers two nights of Chino's life i promise to post in here tomorrow night :)

       Alright i was sleeping about 20 minutes ago maybe a little longer or shorter but i was peacefully sleeping and my brothers friends just start playing the drums and it woke me up so i have to wake up because i can't sleep through that and i get on the computer (of course) and i get on and it's really slow so i restart it and then get on my account thingy and instantly get a million IMs asking me if Gaia is up and of course i had no idea because i was sleeping and so i check and it's not. It has almost been 24 hours since it had been up u.u;; I don't know if i wanna play RO because there are still a lot or people talking to me and i can't just end all these conversations with them XD but oh well i should chat with them while i can because i have to go to school next wednesday T-T well i went to registration earlier today and i got my class list I will share with what classes i have XP. Honors English 2, French 2, Phys. ed. 2, Modern World History, Honors Geometry, Honors Biology, Pre-Enginerring Graphics 2, Sophomore Theology. I like all my classes except history >.> i am no good at all that XP Right now me and a couple friends are making a dictionary or messed up words and i guess it will be how we talk for the rest of our lives so i guess i better go to know this XD Oh well i guess i should just stop talking now and send this so i don't kill people with all the content of my journal messages XD

       Oh gosh i had to get my hair cut today and i hate it to much. It's really short and stupid and i wish i could have left it the way it was. u.u;; But i guess i will just have to deal with it I would have been sent home from school or something if they saw it how it was. XP I am pretty well through the first book i have to read and i can get one of them on tape which shouldn't be bad at all. *sigh* but there is always that third book @__@ i guess i will just have to get as much of it done as i can and maybe my mom and dad will still get me that tablet >.>... Well as a reward of getting my hair cut i get a hat from Genki Gang and i am kinda happy for that ^_^ i was really wanting one so i guess it pays off XD and it will grow back i guess :\ On Gaia today i really didn't go on a whole lot but my friend started a lotto and i will be there bumping sometimes but i will still be in the charities of course and also i got two friend list requests from people i don't even know and then a PM from one of them wanting money : i hate beggers. XP Well... i have registration for school tomorrow and i am going in the afternoon i guess so i have to get up u.u;; oh well i have to get in the pattern of getting up for school so it kinda helps me out. ^_^ ... well i have nothing else to say now... *blinks* yeah.... >.>

       I ended up going to bed around noon and then waking up at 7:00 pm. ._. i really have to get better before school starts next week. Well i read more though ^_^ i got about a fourth of the way through the first book and my goal is to finish the book before 5:00pm tomorrow. and tomorrow at 1:00 i have to get my hair cut T__T i love my hair you can't let them do it and the worst part is that it will be some creepy person i have never met. >      Well on Gaia i was thinking about making my own Charity but then i realized how many new ones there are and that i would just be one of those ones that was ignored so i didn't want to make one. And plus if i did end up making one it wouldn't feel right.. i mean i would have to stay in there a lot and not be able to go to a lot of places and spend my time there ^-^;; so i guess it was just a bad idea i guess once i feel like i want to make on then i will... but who knows when that is >

       Yes, I am still awake for some odd reason... I can't seem to sleep, but i haven't really tried. The computer is so distracting. XP I am progressing in my book that i am on right now and that makes me happy. If i get all three books read before next wednesday i get a drawing tablet of my very own. ^_^ I should be getting sleep and reading more but it's all just to boring. I would rather sit here at the computer, on gaia, watching music videos on the TV. I have to help babysit at 8:00 a.m. and right now it's 5:00 a.m. so if i get any sleep at all it will be only a little bit so i plan on not sleeping at all now. Oh, and also there are a lot more friends that have joined this thing. :) A few of them are the ones i said before but now there are more and i think there is still another one working on his. XD Well i guess now it is back to half reading half chatting on Gaia. XP

       The Gaia inventory is down so i can't change my avatar's clothes. I started this thread with my friend Meky for people who change thier clothes often and I think it will be a hit. It is called the SACD Rehab center which stands for "Sever Avatar Changing Disorder." I also got a few other friends into it, they all do the same. And i am talking to a few people from the thread and people are having avatar changing withdrawls.       It looks like a got a few friends into this journal thing. I know of two who are making ones and then i think there is another.

       Hello people, I guess if you are reading this you either know me somehow or you saw my signature on Gaia. If you have no idea what Gaia is then you are missing out. It is under maintenance right now so I guess I wanted to make an online journal I really have no idea what I am going to write in here and what to do now but I will have to get some pictures and such of what I am doing on Gaia.  Well other news not having to do with Gaia or anything on the internet, I have three books to read before next Wednesday and I am on page 12 of one of them. I should have planned things out a little better for the summer but whatever I enjoyed myself.
