        So yesterday was Ashlee's birthday.&nbsp; We went to Joliet to shop.&nbsp; Target is amazing, so we went in there.&nbsp; A certain someone decides to let out a HUGE fart, right in public!!! How embaressing.&nbsp; I would disown this person, but they are incredible.&nbsp; Therefore, I can't.&nbsp; I got shoes for $3.69. I'm happy.&nbsp; Oh, I bought my sister an N'Sync jewelry box for $1.00 plus tax.&nbsp; Awesome

       Can I just say that I hate when 15 year old sophomore boys think that you are young and dumb and like them.&nbsp; Do I really look younger than I am?&nbsp; I don't see it, but hey, you never know.&nbsp; Thank you for listening.&nbsp; I feel much better.

         Only two days until I get my license back!  My mommy asks me to go into town and get smaller bills from the bank.  The car is usually on the left side, which allows plenty of room to back up and turn around.  My parents lost the garage door openers, so the car is on the right side.  Of course I chose this day to be not observant.  I get in the car, buckle up, and start to back up.  I look behind me, since I am such a good driver.  I notice that I am starting to go off of the driveway and into the ravine.  I figure if I slam on the brakes, it wouldn't be good for the car.  So, I ease onto the brake when I hear a THUD and the car instantly stops moving.  I take a close look from the driver's seat and notice that I have backed my parents SUV directly into a tree.  How convenient.  I pull forward and get out to see how much damage is done.  There is a lovely dent in the back of it.  I go to tell my parents what I have done.  It is at this moment that I discover my neck and back hurt.  Anyway, my parents find it rather humorous and I am not in any trouble.  I just have to pay for it to be fixed.  (I just got done paying off the $793.55 worth of damage my friends did to the car trying to get my keys out of the same vehicle).  My dad says that he will try to get the dent out, but I'm not going to have my hopes up.  I will let you know how it goes.

       I went out with Stefany.&nbsp; We were having a wonderful time.&nbsp; We stopped at a red light, and noticed that there was a guy on a motorcycle next to us.&nbsp; It was rather uncomfortable because our windows were down.&nbsp; He looked over at us and we laughed.&nbsp; He goes "Hey, what's so funny!" In response, I said, "Do you have any grey poupon?"&nbsp; He laughed.&nbsp; That was the last I've seen of him.&nbsp;

        Something funny happened while I was at camp.&nbsp; It was 4:00 in the morning, and me and Ashlee were tired.&nbsp; We decided to draw a unibrow on Brittney.&nbsp; We used washable marker because we are nice like that.&nbsp; Then we put a permanent marker in her hand.&nbsp; When she woke up, she smeared her unibrow.&nbsp; So she knew it wasn't permanent marker.&nbsp; She still got upset with us, but it was hilarious!&nbsp;

        I like to go walking around town with Stefany. Sometimes people are immature and hoot and holler at us. It isn't neat. So it was bastante creepy when this man stops in the middle of Main Street and goes, "Where's the police department?". We must of made a funny face. He goes, "I'm serious where's the police station!" Then we proceeded to tell him to turn right before the doctor's office, when really Stefany should have said turn left. It was pretty lame.

       I just got back from shopping at Wal*Mart.  It was quite an experience.  I felt like an old lady pushing a shopping cart.  And two women talked to me.  It was rather odd.  Ok, that's all I have to say.

       So the other day Jered was talking to Stefany and asked her and me to go out to eat with him and Jacob.  We were at Jered's picking the boys up a long time later (after running around like losers getting cute so we wouldn't end up being late) when I pulled out LeRoy.  LeRoy is my lego man that was in my toothbrush.  They ran him over with a car and then thru him out the window!!! I was and am very upset.  Then Stupid Jacob decides he doesn't want to go.  Oh, this is after Jered "forgot his wallet at home" and we turned around.  I don't remember him getting his wallet, but hey, you never know.  Then we start on our journey to some place in Morris to eat.  Jered has this brilliant idea to eat at "this one place he took Jordan sometime."  We finally find it, and the place is called Petey's.  Stefany and I went there one time and had a waiter that was left-handed and looked like Greg Brady.  It turns out that Greg wasn't there, but Jordan is!!!  How amazing.  He is with other people, but I am too lazy to name them.  So we walk in and Jordan decides that I would be jealous if he flirts with this girl, but of course I don't like him like that and I don't get jealous.  I pull out Jacob's sunglasses and put them on the table in front of an empty chair and announce that we are pretending that is Jacob.  Jordan completely ignored me the whole time, while acknowledging everyone else there.  How cool of him.  I haven't talked to him at all, but the last I heard I am a slut and a "witch."  Now, I think that is better than being a porn-liking, unilip having, dumb ex-boyfriend of Christen Marie Bertrand.  But that's just me.

       Yesterday I went to Magic Waters.  It was crappy and cold at first, so we pretended to sleep under blankets and towels.  Then we ate lunch.  At approximately 1:00, the sun came out!!! Then we went on the lazy river, followed by the wave pool.  We did that for the entire day.  I ate dippin dots and a deep fried snickers! And a corn dog.  It was amazing.  These two creepy kids were talking to us. One was going to be a freshman and the other was going to be a junior. It wasn't neat.  Creepy boys are drawn to Ashlee.  Um, so yeah that's how my day was.
