      Having the summer to prepare for China can be a good thing or a bad thing. I choose to make it good. I'm trying to be productive. I've already set up a new email address, website, and now a blogger to use for journaling- also through my yahoo messengar account I set up my own radio station (so I'll hopefully be able to listen to that over there, :)fun). I have tons left to do studying about china, studying for religous discussions, learning a little bit of the language (I bought language CD's- to learn it, so I should start using them),figuring out what clothes to bring and deciding if I need to buy any new ones, reading the materials they gave us, finding out questions that I have and then getting answers, possibly buying more books from the reading list (especially those they required us to read), getting in touch with others from/going to Wuhan, doing a trial run on packing to make sure I bring the things I need most and what can fit in my suitcase and within the weight limits, making sure I have everything that I want/need on my computer,etc. I know there's more. In a way I wish I was going tomorrow, or even that I was already there, but I guess it's good that I have a couple of months left.   Actually, just this past week, I wasn't even sure that I wanted to go. It's just scary sometimes. But I've seemed to work through that. If I start second guessing again I'll just have to remember why I'm going in the first place and realize that Someone will take care of me and I will not be alone. One of the scarest things that made me second guess was that I'll be teaching at my school by myself- no one else from our group will be with me. But after talking with Beth I realized this is no big deal- turns out there are several people at the school next door (which happens to be just around the corner) and there are people 4k away that's not far. So, if I were to be abandoned, lost, or alone- it would be my own doing. I'll just need to remember to reach out to others and not isolate myself (I really don't think that will be a problem). After talking with Beth, I felt 10 times better- and my confidence in going was renewed. I had other little worries like dealing with being stared at (all the time), eastern style toliets (holes in the ground), knowing what to teach, food, my apartment (whatever condition it may be in), the washing machine (they are rough on clothes),etc., but I know that I need not worry about those things. First off worrying will not change things, and, secondly, it's probably not going to be how I imagine it. I'll just learn to deal with it when I get there. And besides I am pretty flexible, I just need to remember to be that way (if I forget and get overwhelmed).  Good quote to remember:   "Go, prepared for anything, and expect nothing- that way you'll not be disappointed and each day will be an adventure!"
