        I sent the following e-mail to the webmaster of  urlLink Boston Dirt Dogs  yesterday. Of course, I didn't get a reply - probably due to the fact that he's too enraptured with picking apart every aspect of the Nomar trade:     Dirt Dog,   I’m sure you’ve received plenty of comments from die-hard Sox fans about the Nomar situation, so what’s one more Nomar e-mail in your inbox?  I’d like to chime in with my thoughts on the situation.   Surrounding the aftermath of the Nomar trade, there’s a lot of speculation and a lot of he-said-she-said, but why can’t we just focus on the bare facts?  Nomar was traded to the Chicago Cubs and the Red Sox received Orlando Cabrera and Doug Mientkiewicz (that’s about as hard to spell as Grudzielanek) in return.  As difficult of a trade it was to make for the Red Sox, it was the best that could be made given the events of the past year.  Beyond that, everyone can point fingers and make accusations all they want, but at the end of the day, the deal is done and both clubs have improved.    One thing I’ve never understood about the Boston media or the Boston fans is the need to analyze every nuance of every move within the Red Sox organization or the inability to “let it all go”.  I’ll tell you right now – I grew up on the south side of Chicago as a die-hard Cubs fan for 18 years, and for the last 8 I’ve lived in Boston.  My liking for the Red Sox started back in ’86 not because I liked the Red Sox, but because I absolutely hated those bastard Mets.  Since moving to Boston, I’ve found that my appreciation for the Red Sox Nation is tried and true (if  the Cubs losing the NLCS last year was like being kicked in the jewels and falling to the ground, then the Red Sox losing the ALCS the very next day was like trying to get up from said initial kick only to be rendered unconscious by a kick in the face from a Yankees fan) but I still approach my feelings for the club with the mentality of a Cubs fan.  That is, at the end of the day, no matter what happens, I still have this uncanny ability to write off everything that happened that day and still hope my club can do well the next day, with or without Nomar.  (I just happen to be in a position where I didn’t really lose Nomar.)  I suppose that’s just the nature of Red Sox Nation, but that doesn’t mean I understand why it has to be that way.   My way of looking at things is to tune out the drama and focus on what really matters – to get one of these ballclubs a much deserved World Championship.  It’s only been, what, 182 combined years now?  The fact of the matter is the Cubs and Red Sox made a trade that improves both of their clubs, and hopefully it trade will jumpstart a great August for them.  And, if all goes to plan, I’ll be seeing you at Fenway this October with my Kerry Wood jersey and Cubs hat on, cheering for Nomar and my Cubs.   -Bogie
