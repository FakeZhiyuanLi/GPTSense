      I am buying a ~$250 MTB bike on Saturday. I will shock you by saying this is my new commute bike (i don't own a car). Actually the Felt is a better bike, but there is nowhere to change and shower at work, so I am getting a real easy ride for work. Yeah, yeah i am dumber than box of rocks, but the roadie stuff is for the weekends for now. And this new bike will not have clipless pedals (for now).  My rotation has been Sahara Hotnights, Hives, Mooney Suzuki, Black Keys, White Stripes, Radiohead, REM, Velvet Undeground and Pixies (live at coachella). Pretty different, but Hives and Sahara I just saw and both were great. Mooney Suzuki kicks ass, and i saw the Black Keys at coachella and am seeing then again on the 9th of September (at the Fillmore!). REM is okay in my book, and well Velvet Underground are cooooooool. and pixies, well go fuck a goat if you don't like them, or send me the goat an I'll change into an angel, or a beast that brings about the end of the world...  "its not the fall of your empire, the end of your world, i say it will pass, you say this time its neverending, you say its elusive, It's out of your reach, I say the solution might be closer than it seems" - Maria Elisabeth Andersson - Vocals and Lead guitar, Sahara Hotnights  Your idiot in Spain, Sam

      I fell over again today, and now I really know what pain is. My left knee has a big bruise and sends me pain messages whenever I get my butt up of the sofa. I don't think that anything's broken (in my knee), but I hate winceing whenever I extend it. Not good.  I must thank the driver that caused me to fall though. He was most helpful by driving around me (i take MY lane, one away from car doors opening up) and then making a right turn in front of me while I was unclipping and braking hard. That got my weight on the wrong side and I just went down hard. I am pretty skinny so it hurt. I was okay at work, but on the way home my knee kept hurting more and more, and now its painful. Luckily though I had the tights on so not much skin was ripped off, but my knee doesn't care now. Thanks Jackass! Hope you were late to work and got fired and your car caught on fire on the way home, etc.  So now my manefesto on drivers vs. bicyclists. 1.) We share the same space on the road, if I ride in "your lane" please excuse me, a car door opening and catching me could, literaly, kill me. 2.) Your car goes faster than my bike, so pass me when its safe. I have the same right to the road that you do. 3.) Not all people who ride bikes are the same, I obey traffic laws, some people on "bikes" don't. That is at there discretion to act like idiots. Run them over, not me (You can spot them by the fact that they are over 21, and they don't wear a helmet.) 4.) If we are on the same street and come to a stop sign or traffic light I will not pass up any cars to get to the "front of the line". Hell, you already passed me, and so why should I make you pass me again (again your car is faster). And if I am at the back, understand that I need a little space to get going again, whereas your right foot is all you need.  5.)  So 'we get in your way', people ride the wrong way down streets, they cut through red lights/stop signs, think they can do whatever they want to, etc. just remember that a geo and a big rig equally bad problems if they hit us, and that most of us real cyclists are very safety oriented. we wear helmets, avoid busy streets and obey traffic laws ( I can get a ticket too). 6.) If know of someone who rides without a helmet, please tell them to get one, or buy one for them, and make sure they wear it.  Wel; I am done, I am sure my 'manifesto' will get better. it just sucks that my knee hurts because someone was a fucking dick.  Stockton out, sam

      Ernesto is leaving. this sucks major donkey dick. besides being the guy who knows mac hardware and software, he kicks ass on 4-color stuff. I don't blame him for leaving though. mepco offers no benefits (unless you pay for it) , and he has a mortgage to pay for.  So its on me to learn 4-color stuff. I can do it, but not like him.

      I have been doing well at work. At least I think so, but today i screwed up. Nothing big, just I didn't fix a "change and print" negative. I had been very good about that before, better than I used to be. So it wasn't pleasent being Sam for about 30 minutes. I am way to hard on myself and way to hard on others. I know that and that is one of my (many) faults.  Yeah I am a perfectionist, when it comes to work, too bad I don't carry that trait into the rest of my life. Although if I did that I wouldn't have ANY friends and my family would have slit my throat a long time ago.  I am working with a pretty good team, especially the CSR's that are new. We have a good art department (which I am proud to be one of), but its the little shit that drives me nuts. This may not make sense but I don't understand how people can do crap and think its great. Or be told over and over to do something one way and then still not do it.  Today i ran Ad-aware on the Internet PC at work and discovered that it had the 'mydoom' worm on it...needless to say I cleaned it off and the perfomance has improved greatly (well, duh!). Too bad were not running a firewall on anything connected to the net, it might cost us 60 bucks a year(!!!)...I should just ask for a raise for cleaning that shit up and tell the Head Honcho to get an IT person. I also upgraded to OSX 10.8.2 and it seems to work better on my G4 box. Not a big fan of Linux/Unix but then again my XP pro box at home has serious issues with freezing in gameplay that I can't figure out. The games just stop and lock up the box. I am updated on windows so maybe its just that I bought a PNY 128mb video card. I havent heard great stuff from people about "pony'" stuff.  Or maybe the audio (onboard) is fucking it up. Just frustrating to buy software and then it shits on you. Maybe I should buy more books about this...  So enough of my work...play! play! PLAY! I have to give back Danielle's car this weekend. So I will be on the bus again or just riding my new (hopefully) mountain bike to work. Depends how hot it gets here. Was 107 yesterday, and i think it 'cooled' down to 104 today. Anyway, I have been looking at new stuff and today i just got $30 back from performancebike.com. So if I add that with the $10 I recieved before, thats 40 bucks to upgrade (tires and tubes). I will insist on cages and water bottles as free though. If I drop a few on a bike the least they can do is make it complete.  Wow, all those words and really not much to say. Thank you for your patience, The 116 lb Mick.Geek.Dork.Sam

      So its 4:20 am and I can't sleep. So I was up watching videos on Launch, seeing some pretty good stuff by The Mooney Suzuki, Black Keys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Stripes. Too bad M-TV is such a stinkhole of shows. You used to just be able to sit and watch video after video there. I don't have a clue if they even play videos anymore. I am 'sans' TV so I guess I miss a lot of stuff, but actually it is nice not having the big idiot-box. I have this little idiot box that gives me much more than any TV could. Yeah I have the bill for the DSL, but actually if i do buy a TV (contemplating it) I have no idea where I'd put it in my tiny studio. If I do get one though I guess I will have to break down and get cable (Yeech!). And whose Idea is it that you can opt for HBO or Cinemax but you can't opt out of 14 Spanish language stations, or HSN, or The Idiot Channel? Why cant you just pick the stations you want and pay for those? I mean really, if I can pick a premium channel why isn't the technology there for me to choose just the stations that I want to see? Or is it there and they are just butt-fucking the public into paying 50 bucks a month for crap that no one watches? WTF is up with that and why doesn't the public say screw you cable?  Anywho, not much else going on here. I bought some new shoes for the bike, they are nice. Pearl Izumi's (I like pearl stuff) and got to test them out last weekend. I didn't go far but I really notice the difference between them and the Axo's. Yeah I want a pair of Carnac's but right now I have better things to do with 300 bucks, like buy a mountain bike (a Giant). I am going to get it pretty soon so I will have that to ride to work. I'd ride the Felt, but its a big hassle (nowhere to change at work, etc.) and I don't like riding it downtown. If I get mugged, I'd rather give up a 300 dollar MTB than a 1200 dollar roadie.  Having Danielle's car has been nice, and I want to get one again. I just don't know if I can afford one. Gas is stupidly expensive and insurance sucks big bull dork. I'll save up and hopefully by the end of the year I can get something.  Earth out.

      Hi,  I went to SF on Sunday to see some bands play at the Fillmore. I had never been to The Fillmore and was most impressed by the number of great bands that have played there. They have framed posters lining the walls of the shows. If you ever get the chance to see a show there, just looking at the posters and being in that place is worth the price of admission.  Anyway, a friend from work and I went to see the show. The line-up was The Hives, Sahara Hotnights, and The Reigning Sound. All Swedish bands (on the same label, I take it). My take on the night was that for $20 I got a great deal. The Reigning Sound opened. I was not impressed. But that doesn't mean that they aren't good. I just personally didn't like them.  The next band was Sahara Hotnights, who I saw at Coachella Music Festival on May 1, 2004. This is a four piece all girl band that looks great and sounds even better. To tell the truth, I bought the tickets for the show because I wanted to see them again. (I didn't even know who The Hives were!) They just kicked maximum booty at Coachella, and I was looking forward to another great performance. Well they did just that, and despite having a short set (30 minutes!!!) they kicked arse again. They are out supporting a new album (Kiss and Tell), and played 7 or 8 songs off of it, plus some stuff off of "Jenny Bomb". And I got to dancing with a really cute girl (who I did not know) that was right next to me, well kind of dancing... (is head banging, smiling, and looking at each other and shouting out the lyrics dancing?)  Then came the Hives...  Stunned I was, for a bit and then started SCREAMING! So did everybody else. Talk about steal a show! F&amp;*k Mick Jagger with an iron mine, Pelle Almvquist is the SHIT! A frontman to DIE for. He knew what he was doing when, a few songs into the set, he asked if anyone else wanted to point at him (because someone was), using that universal "sign" and everyone did. And for good measure he went out into the crowd 3 times and they just lifted him back up onstage. Great band all around, a drummer that kicks tail and a lead guitarist that is nothing less than a phenom. They just got the crowd going and never let up! I was actually quite amazed and can't quite put into words what I really saw. Volvo's are nice but if Sweden keeps producing bands like Hotnights and The Hives, we'll be buying millions more cds than cars from them.   Sam  Any good music is appreciated, let me know what you are listening to thats new, fresh and no one has heard of.
