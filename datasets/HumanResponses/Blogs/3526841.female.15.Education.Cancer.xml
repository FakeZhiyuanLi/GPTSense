						   well thats sommat i taught myself about at a very young age i suppose reli i didnt know the meaning of a real lie then but i always said to myself if i know somone has lied to me about somthing i would confront them
and how long did that last................................. well until somone told me a proper lie not just sommat to make me feel better about my self not lil white lies..................................... proper big woper lies!!
so reli ill sum it up 4u about 1 mounth when my dad told me he loved me
the one thing is its mainly now i think that thats a lie.............................. but is it a lie because i only think its a lie because i feel he is always trying to make me into someone im not his perfect child well realy we all know his perfect child would be well basicaly the oposite of me but i wouldnrt b able to do that i can only be myself 
so anyway if somone lies to you you should confront them right?
to be honest im fed up of lies not just from my dad saying he will spend more time with me and spend more time at home (funny i aint seen him all week cas hes in ipswitch) other things which i dont understand why people lie about i can handle the truth!! i aint gonna have a falling out with somone cas somthing makes then happy and not me 
ok tthat sounded bitchy rite u know if say...........................................................................................................
r stuff it i aint gonna fall out if you make things diff 2 hat i want as long as i know my mates are happy it will make me happy as will not b abale 2 b happy if they aint so what is the point in telling somone lies to make them happier when in the end it is just gonna  make every one misserible!!! OK!!
what the hell am i on about i sound like i am actuali talking to aomone who knows the slightest ting about my life!!!! or somone who knows all th lies but no one does. no one!!only me i know all the lies in my life all the lies i have had to hear!!! but relly the biggest lies are from me to me about how they didnt mean it just trying to convince my self!! well guess what im gonna make a fresh start soon its all gonns b over i know i can do it and the lies will b over
what the hell am i saying the lies what be over cas everyone lies rite? its human we have this lil thing that makes up make mistakes  i hate it!!!

						   ok you that all these diff religions all argue and fight well isnt it true that it says in many religions that you should respect others and treat everyone as equals!! so why are you fighting with these other people 'because of your religion' by doing this you are disobyeing it and you are displeaseing your god
even somtimes they have he same god they just praise  them in different ways!!
also you cant force someone to love god it is their choice faith is earned you cant force it appon someone!! praiseing and loving god it not a chore it should make people proud to say i love god i am part of his family and he loves my he is my farther my holy farther and he is always there to look over us if you are forced  to feel that way i will not be real and that wont be real love for god and he will know even if others dont!! so why force somone  when they should decied for themselves and experiecne god for themselves and if they dont belive in god it will never stop him loving them and they are his their hevenly farther like he is to everyone

						   ok so im a 14 year old girl soon 2 be 15 and well i have alot of veiws on everything happening in the world and i feel extraemly strongly about them ever since a very young age i have been thinking about everything that goes on in the world and everything that has gone on in the world even though i have many views on thing thinking about this stuff also means i have alot of questions to many of them i have asked but thousnads of them are still in my head still confusing me but these ones are not about life they are about people why do poeple do all those mean horrible things 
the thing that annoies me the most and keep brewing in my head and i keep asking myself over and over and over is well dicrimination and predjudisim!!
as a young child i grew up with poeple that reli wernt like me and my family all around me i got used to it and every time i hear about people discriminating poeple and saying things about them just because they are different it reli winds me up!!
the other day i heard these boys on my bus shouting out packie jokes well gess what it id disgusting!! i know that also this boy that was saying most of them is also a homophobic which relly drives me mad as i am well up for gay rites as all people should be treated the same!! so y does everyone do this!!
