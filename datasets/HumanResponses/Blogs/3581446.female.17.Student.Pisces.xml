       Revenge of the Funny Aim Conversations   OK... So this is a funny AIM conversatio n ; singular. Yes, Anderson is just that funny.   *** Me: Y'know, I am sort of Eddish, myself Me: Sheltered geek with a facsination for Bebop and mostly around for comic relief Anderson: lol Me: Too bad the cosplay options for that would be relatively limited... Anderson: for Ed? Me: Oui Me: My being male, and all Anderson: i've only seen one Ed cosplay..  ev4r Me: Yeah Me: And my being '6"3, male, and portly in stature would preclude any attempt on my part, unless I was really drunk or just nuts Anderson: you've never seen "male Faye" have you Me: Oh. Dear. God. Me: Fear and Loathing on Mars. Anderson: http://www.angelfire.com/rock3/beboppin/pictures/manfaye.jpg Me: *clicks with an irrepressible feeling of intense fear in the pit of his stomach* Me: AGG! Me: UGHH!! Me: *convulsions* Me: *pain* Me: *wishes he were dead* Anderson: [ link censored for your protection ] Me: NOO! NO MORE!! Me: *convulsions* Anderdson:: [ link censored for your protection ] Me: ... Anderson: i'm evil Me: Very much so Me: I'm pretty sure I'm traumatized now Me: One more step towards the brink for me, of course  ***  Anderson: Dr4gon said: "Im getting a Bugatti16-4Veyron" Anderson: is that some kind of techno sausage Anderson: ? Me: LOL Me: What in the hell is a Techno Sausage? Me: ...Or do I want to know?  ***  Me: Your friends are almost as nutty as mine Anderson: my friends advertise me as the nutty one Anderson: and everyone agrees Anderson: usually i see myself as the least nutty of them all Me: I would agree Me: Though you are a nut (as am I) Anderson: i never said i was sane.  i just don't see myself as "The" nut Me: Oh Me: I see Anderson: like how Frank is "The" cynic.  Brad is "The" Donatello. Anderson: Tyler is "The" newbie Me: ... Me: I have no idea what that means Anderson: ok Me: But I getcha, all the same Me: Who is 'the' nut, IYO? Anderson: we don't have a "The" nut, really. Anderson: everyone in our group can be equally pathetic at the right moments Me: You know how the old poker saying goes Me: If you can't spot the rube at the table, you're it.  Anderson: *makes Spike's "WTF, Jet?" face* daemon1337: lol Anderson: i'm not a nut Anderson: err Anderson: "The" nut Me: D'nile ain't just a river in Egypt, Anderson  Anderson: *shakes his fist violently* damn you, you madman! Me: If I were part of your group, I'd be the nut, most likely Me: I did, after all, spend most of the day pasting Jean-Paul Sartre's head unto a picture of two people on a Vespa scooter

      Ok, ok, about time I explain the 'Sartre on a Scooter' remark.    urlLink This  is the French Vespa website. I was discussing said website with a friend, like so:     Me:    Vespa est entré dans l'histoire non comme un simple scooter mais comme un "mythe", une façon d'être, de penser et de s'exprimer.  Ah, only French could bring such dignity to a website on scooters.   Me:   If Sartre had rode on a scooter, he would've loved that.  The image of  urlLink Sartre  on a  urlLink scooter  struck me as funny, so I decided to make it the new motto. :)   -Jean

      My Catch Phrases:   "Yama-hama!" as in "Monkeys have overrun the white house? Yama-hama!" OR "Cindy Crawford emailed me? Yama-hama!"  STOLEN FROM : Seinfeld (however, I'm the first one I know of to use it for positive as well as negative exclamations.)   "X a go-go!" as in "He drinks three martinis every night? Boozer a go-go!" (Generally a method of placing emphasis.)   " GWAAARGH!! " as in "McDonald's rejected my job application?  GWAAARGH!! " (sort of a general expression of extreme frustration)  -Ian

      If you remember, terminatore said 'hasta la vista', on some occasions, to his defeated foes. Why the choice was made to make one of his catchphrases in Spanish is quite beyond me, but it actually reveals a lot about the psychology of language.   'Hasta la vista' is Spanish for 'goodbye', and it literally means something like 'Until I see you again'. The French equivilent would be 'Au revoir'. Now what would've been the reaction if Arnold had said 'Au revoir' before he extinguished the eternal flame of his enemy?  It just wouldn't work.   French is just not a toughguy catchphrase language. Why Spanish works better is beyond me; but whatever it is, French don't have it. French is, at best, an intellectual catchphrase language ('Au revoir, les pensées traditionnelles de la philosophie', Sartre might say, if he were prone to saying such things - 'Au revoir, Dieu' might've been the motto of the French revolution, if it were made into an action movie), and perhaps a romantic catchphrase language, but it is definitely not a toughguy catchphrase language.   The French themselves know this, of course. Thus their tremendous jealousy towards us, when they have to watch American action movies and witness the substandand effort to make the transition between American toughguy phrases and the French tongue. American action movies aren't that popular in France, you say? Of course. Now you know why.   Anyway, this was why Arnold's line was Spanish in the first place- to reach out to the French, of course. The hope was that Spanish could become the Esperanto of toughguy movie quotes- a neutral, auxilliary language that everyone could enjoy without giving up their native tongue. Much like Esperanto, though, it never caught on, at least not to the degree the creator would've liked.   Oh well. Unity on toughguy action movie quotes eludes us, and it's just as pernicious a problem as any other world unity problem, lemme tell ya.  -Ian

      BIG O SPOILER WARNING!!!  SPOILER!!  SPOIL, I SAY!  PASS ON TO THE NEXT ENTRY IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!  ***  I saw the last episode of the second season of Big O for the first time last night...    GWAAARGH!!!   What in the heck were they thinking? I mean, undoubtedly it did answer a few questions and IMO established a few things... Such as Roger being some sort of Jango Fett-esque robotic super soldier built to pilot Big O- and I liked the (percieved) ultimate message that Roger's negotiating skills were his true power, over and above his gadgets and Megaduses (Megadi?). And heck, the ultimate ending, which was an obvious callback to the first episode, had an ethereal, beautiful quality that I enjoyed in its melanchony; but ultimately it recklessly raised so many questions with complete disregard for the audience that I found it endlessly frustrating.   For instance, what the hell happened to Angel and A.R.'s pop? Was there some sort of VR implication going on there? How could angel watch the events transpire on a screen? Where was she, and how did Roger and Dorothy get there? Was Big Ear some sort of robot? What happened forty years ago, anyway?   *sigh* Oh well... -Ian

      Okay, college, I can do that. Sounds like fun. But to pick the right college, you have to know what you want to do with your life. And to be even relatively accurate at that, you have to know who you are. I've no idea who I am, so how can I pick a career, and thus how can I pick a college? And yet, in a sort of existential way, I'm doomed to choice. Oh well.   -Ian

       Quotes   "Writing is the best way to get ideas out of your head."  -Nietzsche  "Nietzsche was stupid and abnormal." -Tolstoy   "Be careful when using big words. The difficulties of turning them into big deeds are formidable."  -Lenin  "Pablo Picasso was Spanish; so am I. Picasso was a painter; so am I. Picasso was a communist; neither am I."  -Salvador Dali   'And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O men of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious, saying, `What shall we eat?' or `What shall we drink?' or `What shall we wear?' For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well. "Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Let the day's own trouble be sufficient for the day.'  -Jesus, Mat. vi, 27-34  "Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all things which exist; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread and the contexture of the web." -Marcus Aurelius, Meditations  "God calls man first. Man may forget his Creator or hide far from his face; he may run after idols or accuse the deity of having abandoned him; yet the living and true God tirelessly calls each person to that mysterious encounter known as prayer. In prayer, the faithful God's initiative of love always comes first; our own first step is always a response. As God gradually reveals himself and reveals man to himself, prayer appears as a reciprocal call, a covenant drama. Through words and actions, this drama engages the heart. It unfolds throughout the whole history of salvation." -Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2567  "Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake."  -Napoleon   "Even monkeys fall from trees."  -Korean Expression   "Hatred never did hatred solve; this is a truth eternal."  -Buddha  "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire." -Confucius  "Visits? That would indicate visitors."  - Plan 9 From Outer Space   "Happiness rests in misery. Misery hides in happiness." -Daodejing of Laozi  "Bear costumes are funny. Bears, as well."  -Christopher Walken   -Ian

       On Faith   Faith cannot be a one-time thing; moreover, it cannot be a thing consisting of a few minutes relegated to the beginning or end of a day. Serious time ought to be devoted to something so important, and not just on sabbaths or vesaks. How much time do we spend in idle dalliances? Watching T.V.? Logging unto the computer (Blogging ;) )? How much more important should religion be than any of these mundane things?  -Ian

       Musings on The Mind   The mind is a very contrary beast. It expresses its contrarity in two general ways; the 'Elephant' way and the 'Catepillar' way. I call them these names because two ancient stories/maxims explain perfectly what they are:  "Try not to think of blue elephants" What happens if you do?  You think of blue elephants, of course. Now, I'm not exactly sure why the mind works this way- God works in mysterious ways, as they say- but it's damn annoying. Especially when you're trying not think of something! This comes up most often in worry. When you worry about something, you try not to think about it. Then the 'elephant' algorithmn kicks in and you immedietely think about it. Lather, rinse, repeat- go insane!  Let's say the entire world, or the life of your most loved ones, depended on you not thinking a certain thought. Let's say some telepathic nutball would harm them only if you thought about a purple balloon. What do you think would happen? Oh, you'd try your best- for certain- but you'd fail every time. No matter what the stakes, it seems like the mind just doesn't care. Its contrarity extends to homocidal and even suicidal levels.   What does this tell us about the mind? The other story is:  "One time, an ant asked a catepillar how it was that he was able to move all those legs in perfect synergy. The catepillar said, 'Hmm, let me think about it...'- and he never walked again."  When we think about how we do something, we get all mixed up. What at first seems easy on an intuitive basis become speciously difficult when we try to reason it out into thinking. This seems like a related concept to our mind's contrarity; but it's not clear exactly how.   So again, what does this tell us about the mind? Firstly, it tells us the mind cares very little for what we want; in fact, it's more interested in what we don't want. In fact, the mind doesn't even care what's good for itself; it's contrarity will easily descend into self-destructive actions.   One is tempted to consider the classical Chinese belief that a person hasn't one soul, but many; seven 'bo' souls and three 'hun' souls. They both do everything possible to escape the body, according to traditional myth; but while the hun only act fairly, the bo souls actually act in interests of self-sabotage, and do everything possible to frustrate the life and progress of a human being.   But perhaps we are at risk of becoming too mystical here; the simple fact is that while part of our mind seems to do what we want, other parts do the exact opposite.   I imagine insane asylums are full of people who took their mind too seriously. I can't prove this scientifically, but I suspect there have been many tortured souls assailed by the contrarity of their own mind who were eventually driven mad by it. For anyone whose ever had any experience with mental contrarity, it's certainly imaginable.   So then, what is the solution?   Try not to try.   What does that mean? It sounds all Zennish and self-contradictory. But it's true, nontheless- if one wants the mind to cease being all contrary and making you nutty, evidently you have to do something. And yet, every attempt at doing something will be rebuffed by the contrarity of the mind.   Therefore, the only solution is to do nothing. To try not to try. To neither attempt to impose one's will on the mind nor to co-operate with it.   More later. -Ian

       More on Lojban Grammar   Now, up until the this example, you might think that this is nothing special- all language with a word-position based grammar use the order of arguements to express the function of a word in the sentence-  however,  Lojban takes arguements for its verb-like-words (called  selbri ) that are normally only expressed with conjunctions in other languages. For instance:   mi tavla la martan. la lojban   What happened there? We find another proper-name after the second  sumti  (arguement to the  selbri  with la lojban, with means 'Lojban' in Lojban. A direct translation of this sentence seems odd:   «I talk Martha Lojban.»  And this would certainly not be a proper sentence in English, or almost any language- besides Lojban, that is. You see, the third sumti for the selbri tavla (which, of course, you've found out by now means 'talk', 'speak', etc.) expresses the topic spoken about. So therefore:   mi tavla do la bil   Means, «I talk to you about Bill». Whatever words that are usually added with conjunctions that are inherent to the meaning of the selbri, are expressed using word-order. Of course, some verbal information is non-specific; such as tense or location, and that is expressed using particles.   But anyway, more on this in a bit.  -Ian

       French Keycodes   If you want to type French and don't have an AZERTY keyboard, (and really, who does?) you can always use these keycodes (hold ALT, type numbers on keypad, release ALT):   « == 174 » == 175 é == 130 à == 133 ç == 135  è == 138 ê == 136  î == 140  Ç == 128 ù == 151 ï == 139 â == 131 ô == 147 ë == 137  Also, if you want to type Bahá'í or Bahá'í related names like Bahá'u'lláh, these diacritics will come in handy:  á == 0225 (reverse of 133) í == 0237  -Ian

       Lojban Grammar    urlLink Lojban  grammar, so far as I understand it, is pretty simple. It works somewhat like a computer program- in computer programs, you have a set number of arguements that go to a function. Take this Python function, for instance:   def add (a, b): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return a + b  This program expects a select number of arguements- namely, two- to work. Now, think about how this would work in terms of language...   def talk (a, b): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.talks(b)   Let's say we were to use it,   talk("Bill", "Martha")  We'd know that 'Bill' is talking to 'Martha' (whomever they are). Or if we said:   talk(me, you)  You'd know that whoever was represent by the variables 'me' and 'you' were talking. It works pretty much the same in Lojban:   mi tavla do   Now, of course, like most languages, Lojban puts one of the variables before the verb (though that is changable), and that is somewhat unusual in programming language terms, but basically the ideas are analogous. Now, if you wanted to replace those variables with actual names, you'd have to Lojbanize the names (see the link for info on that), and prefix them with the particle 'la', which just means 'what follows is a name'. So:   la bil. tavla la martan.    (the period is optional quasi-punctuation that just indicates a pause after the name) Now, what if you wanted to, instead of variables or proper names, insert nouns? It works in a similar fashion- 'le' prefix for definite references, (THE x) and 'lo' for indefinite ones ('a'  or 'some'):   le tavla cu tavla mi  "The talker is talking to me"   Anyhow, more information is available on the website. I'll post more tidbits later, perhaps.  -Ian

      Bonjour!  Welcome to The Eclectic. I go by various names online, but here we can call me 'Ian'. Which is my name. Convenient, yes? No? Too bad. ;) Anywho, I don't mean for this blog to have a definite theme or plan because I honestly don't do that well with themes and plans. I'm not a good 'themer', or 'planner', or whatever.   I'm interested in various things. Religion is one- I mainly am interested in  urlLink Catholicism  and  urlLink Bahá'í . If you're of one of these faiths, or maybe of an entirely different faith, please let me know. I'd be quite interested to hear of your experiences and compare them with mine.   Philosophy is cool too. I like  urlLink Pragmatism  and  urlLink Existentialism , though I'm not a strict ideologue for either of these viewpoints. Again, if you are an adherent to either of these philosophies or something totally different, I'd be interested to know.   Politically, I like  urlLink Libertarianism , though I disagree with them on a few issues.   I use  urlLink Linux  as my OS (though fortune sometimes compells me to use windoze bokses), and I like to program in  urlLink Python  and sometimes  urlLink Perl .   I speak a little French, and I'm interested in conlangs such as  urlLink Esperanto  and  urlLink Lojban .   Anyway, that's all I can think of for thise moment. More later.   -Ian

       Movies and other trivial crap   How to fill dull days where your mind can't do anything except wander to the thoughts of a good smoke. I know I seem to be obsessed with it, but dammit, you just try to quit and find that smoking was pretty much the only thing you were doing all day long. You only know this when you stop doing it. I've been replacing one addiction with another unintentionally. From  nicodemon  to The Sims. I must say that I found SimCity, and even SimTower much more interesting and fun than The Sims. But it's good enough to get me hooked. I'm sitting here aching as usual since I quit. Maybe the game will take away some of my pain?  To fill the empty void in my days, I've also been buying a whole bunch of VCDs. Some movies I've seen:   Windtalkers:  ack! What shit is this? I was ready for a good old war movie. Hell, I was even expecting European war. I had no clue it was about the Pacific war. Who the hell cares. Nicholas Cage cannot act. I must scream this little factoid from the top of my lungs, so that nobody will ever fall into the trap Hollywood and the capitalists have set for us to make us believe that this man can, in fact, act. I suppose staring with an empty look in your eyes (like Droopy, that dog, or whatever it is, from the cartoons) and your mouth half-open is called acting. Only thing we need now to make our jaws drop in awe is some drool dripping down the sides of his mouth.   Master and Commander:  this is supposed to be a  guy only  movie. Is it unnatural that I enjoyed it? And it wasn't because Paul Bettany is so darn goodlooking either (I tend to watch him on the screen with the patented Nicholas Cage look, plus drool). It was a fun movie and had really nice music. I'm not sure where it came from, but throughout the film, I felt like continuously kicking Billy Boyd in the face. Not that he did a bad job, but I just felt that urge. Beats me.   Tomb Raider 2:  and I thought you couldn't sink lower than TR 1! I didn't even finish this piece of crap, I went to the cpu to play The Sims halfway in the movie, and my roommate fell asleep after 34 minutes. At least the story is easier to get, but man, is it dull. I can't remember seeing anything blow up either. I mean really blow up, with fire and a miniature mushroom cloud. I usually don't really like action movies, but I was longing to see something blow up in this one. Although I must say that watching a piece of Santorini crumble was quite relieving. (whatever happened to the partiers? Did they all die? Did that fancy turntable survive? Where exactly is Santorini? I know it's in Greece, but where in Greece? Why was Lara Croft so happy about this terrible disaster? Is she really that shallow, that she can only focus on the money, and completely ignore this awful tragedy? Whatever happened to the old guy? These are just a few of the questions that arose in my mind while watching the first 15 minutes of the movie.)   Monster:  a bit nice, but pathetic. What a pathetic person. Good acting, not so sure about Christina Ricci. I still doubt whether her acting is a style I need to get used to, or, if in fact, she just sucks. Not the best movie about pathetic people I've seen (The Hours, different pathetic, but still a bit pathetic. Definitely better), but it had the most mesmerizing first kiss scene I've ever seen in a flick! Powerful enough to make me slightly (really slightly, dammit. I'm too cool for that) shiver.  And why does everyone smoke in every single movie?

      To the totally free man, life is but another canvas on which to create the art of his life, knowing that every choice and selection can only be made on the basis of the intuitive understanding of the artist, not based on reality per se or on preconcieved dependable principles which the artist can rely on, but selections from the whole of reality both concrete and conceptual, a flowing forth of personal ideas and self-manifested meaning which strikes across the canvas in the colors and shapes and ideas which only the artist can concieve of or understand.   Nobody can escape the duty of painting the vista of their own lives; whether they know it or not they are doomed to choose their palletes and colors, every moment anew and thinking of the direction which the piece is going to take. Nobdy can tell you what colors to choose or what things to paint unless you allow them to; the choice is your's, always your own.   And in your choosing the only universal constant is that you must fufill two things: you must know yourself, and you must take responsibillity of what you create. Irresponsibile art is pornography or amusement, created once and tossed into a vat of public consumption with no reflection of the artist's soul or ideas. It is trash and excrement, spun forth and forgotten.   No; it is not art at all. To be an artist you must live and breathe your art, soak it in and develop it, and taste it and consume it, it must be as much a part of you as your arm or leg, and who cannot take responsibillity for their own arm and leg?  Only you can choose what you want to create. Only you can decide to be decent or depraved, kind or hurtful, good or evil; Your life is the canvas of your principles and ideas, to be molded into a perfect replica of your essential soul. Life is only self-expression, nothing more.   There is nothing dependable; except that which we choose to beleive is, there is no port for our regattas or solid ground on which we find our feet. Our lives are the tossing back and forth betwen the winds and the storms, forging always our path by our own choices through the fortuitous night.   Our lives are the lives of artists. Our meaning is our own.  -Theo

      So, yesterday, I'm in town, and I hear that my brother has finally completed his book. Excellent! Since I got a fair bit of cash recently, I decide to take my brother, sis, mom and pop out to dinner at a nice resturaunt. So we get there, and we learn it'll be a half-hour wait... OK, not bad.   My bro decides to take off and pay a visit to a business associate at a coffeeshop just down the street. OK. Sounds like fun, and it'll pass the time. As we sit there talking to him there, though, it begins to POUR rain outside, one of those terrible, torrential Avril showers.   What's worse, my pop comes knocking on the window, informing us that our table is ready. He has an umbrella- my brother is wearing a coat-  I am in a hawaiian shirt and cargo pants.    Yeeeeah. Recipe for success. I get totally soaked, head-to-toe, and of course that pisses off my mother, who wasn't too enthused at the idea of me and my brother going over there in the first place. OK. Not so bad.   But on top of all of that, my mom, pop, and sis complain that their burgers suck, even though mine, strangely, is juicy and delicious. So I drop $60 on a meal I and maybe my brother enjoyed.   But you know what I say.    Eh Bien. C'est la vie. C'est comme ?a va.   I said that repeatedly, until my pop declared in frustration,  AM I DOOMED TO LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH MAURICE CHEVALIER!??   Sigh. Eh bien. C'est la vie. C'est comme ?a va.

      What the hell is going on? I've been having aches everywhere and my tongue feels swollen and sore. Wasn't I supposed to have all that stuff when I was still smoking instead of now?? It seems I've been in terrible shape ever since I quit. It's not supposed to work that way. Oh well, such is life: pain in my ass and several other bodyparts, incl. tongue.  In case you're all wondering, I did make it past DT. I'm already in DF (Day Fourteen), which is very true because I live in Mexico D.F. What are the odds!

      It's getting closer and closer to Day Twelve, isn't it. Actually, I think it already is Day Twelve. Early in Day Twelve, but we're there.   For all those who are wondering what Day Twelve is: it is the fine line seperating madness and sanity. Day Twelve (referred to as DT from now on) is the day I cannot pass in my quest to end the awful nicotine addiction I too often find myself trapped in.   Everytime I try to quit them cancersticks, I have to give up my valiant attempt in defeating the drug on DT. It has been slowly building since DE (Day Eight) to surely come to a bombastic climax, fireworks and nachos included, on DT. I can visualize myself crumbling now, succumbing to the nagging urge inside my Nicotine Bone (that spot inside your chest that longs for a fix, similar to the tickling of the 'Funny Bone'), falling to my knees while pleading to the skies above to end this madness, this torture! What works well is to be such an ass about everything: whining, moaning and shouting daily, that whoever lives with you, in my case: my roommate, can't stand it any longer and rushes out to buy you cigarettes. Why this works: now you can blame your relapse into oblivion on the other person as you sit in your corner, gently stroking your halo and basking in innocence while huffing and puffing on your drug.  But I have sworn to myself not to allow my devious addicted mind to do that this time. I will not be convinced by the drug induced voices that beg me to break and trample something my roommate holds so dearly to her sweet little heart, such as the glass picture frame that holds the photograph of her long lost mother, like last time. (actually, her mom is still alive and doing well, but I'm just trying to make a point here)  This time I will stand and shout like a French Revolutionary in those damn paintings: "VIVE LA LIBERTE!" as in, freedom from cigarettes. I'll be sure to keep you updated if anyone will still remember this two minutes from now. Whatever, right.

      Kind of a crappy day today.   Felt the incredible crush of existential angst, while detesting in the strongest of terms my seemingly inevitable fate of being both aphilosopher and a misologist... Also, feeling cynical and misanthropic, in a hypocritical and self-abnegating sort of way. The demons of sleep caught up with me and extracted their fee, deprivingme of even more hours of the day...   hat of course being on top of the hours I spent talking to Loupe... Or Loupette. I tell you, when you can talk to someone for nearly eight hours straight with hardly a single lull in the conversation, you're reaching dangerous levels of conversational compatabillity.   Which reminds me- I and she have agreed that I am, most likely, some sort of clone of her with slight modifacations. To what end and by whom, we're not yet certain, but the evidence is fairly compelling.  The weather changed, so my monitor and modem have begun acting bitchy again, which means conversely that there shall be no L-box logging unto the net. Oh well.  I'm pretty sure there's nothing I can do about the philosopher/misologist status. I pretty much fail every time I try to dismantle my philosophical instincts, and like any experienced philosopher, I absolutely detest reason and wish I could live like regular people do, more or less by instinct alone. People usually don't go very wrong with that strategy.   Anyone considering getting into philosophy: don't. It will kill you sooner or later. As the refrains of a Chinese opium addict went, "My words are like the loud laugh of someone who is presently drowning".   As for the misanthropy and self-abnegation, I just need to lighten up. Actually, I need to do that about a lot of things, but I find it difficult. So there.  To anyone who was depressed or otherwise bummed by this post... Er, sorry. Don't worry about me. Things aren't so bad. It's just darkest before dawn, anyway. Tout va aller bien. All will be well. Life goes to the fighters, especially those who keep going when they're on the ropes. Those who stake little win less, those who press their bets win every time.   Is this true? I don't know. It doesn't matter. It's what I need to believe right now. Something that will work by your belief in it is not qualitatively inferior to something that will work whether you believe it or not. Function is truth.  -Theo

       I had a blast today   Bought a new book, got compliments on one of my hawaiian shirts and my new backpack, had some good coffee, went to the library and read Le Monde, discussed Confucius and east asian culture outside my favorite coffeehouse, plus I got plenty of walking exercise!    The only bad part was lunch. I had some substandard Mongolian pork while overhearing some people argue loudly in Cantonese.  Wasn't too bad, though. The arguing reminded me of home...  -Theo

      Hello everyone out there, I am the newest addition to the Eclectics. Now having established that I am going to expound on the evil of caffeine free beverages as I feel they are quite deceiveing in their presentation.   I will cite one example that happened to me recently, I went to pick up a bottle of pepsi, thinking "hey I will watch anime tonight and binge drink pepsi cola" little did I know that because there was no color difference on the bottles I bought, that I would be scammed out of my anime fuel!  It hit me like a Tornado, 'What treachery is this?!' and alas that night I did not make it through my entire collection, instead I had to settle with only watching Bebop before the consequences of being up for two days straight, took it's toll on my body and then the warm and loving darkness of unconciousness gripped my tortured, nacho laden form, oh well such is life..   - Kman

      BTW, using the symbol '' is the new, official way to abbreviate the title of thus blog to a single charecter. For example:   "Have you checked  yet today?"   For those of you who need that symbol for representing the 'euro' and worry about ambiguity, too damn bad! The wheels of progress march on!   -Theo

      Okay.  Why does everyone want me up at 3PM today?!  Everyone knows I sleep til 5PM during the week.  I mean, think about it.  I go to bed at 6AM!  "Getting up early" is not in my best interests.  I mean, I'M SORRY IF I DON'T GO ON TEN MINUTES OF SLEEP EVERY NIGHT!  Chew on that one for awhile, Duckshirt.  I'd tell you guys about the A Perfect Circle concert I went to (in detail), but supposedly I have some kind of limits to the kind of words I can say and the kind of things that I can talk about.  You know, this Blog is supposed to be suitable for human beings and all.  Anywho, I need to find some kind of edible (sp?) substance.  Prolly cereal.  Later.

      LIGHT & PARADOX  I feel a lot of the old shadows,  Being chased away by early morning light,  Though there isn't any yet.   I open my windows,  To let in the early morning light,  Though the sun hasn't risen yet.   I bask,  In the sun's warm morning light, Though there isn't any really.  The sun of my heart shines an early beacon,  Foreshadowing the light of clear day.   -Theo

      I'd like to change my middle name from August to Theophilus; now, there's technically a legal prochedure to be followed, but essentially names are a matter of convention, what you're 'known as', so being known as it would be for most intents and purposes (except the most legal of legal) suffecient.   So, I announce that heretofore my middle name is 'Theophilus'! Calling me by the diminutive 'Theo' as a nickname is encouraged.   -Theo

       Maddie == Anti-Semite?   Alrighty. To preface, I am not an anti-semite. (I'm using this in the sense that it generally is in western society; discrimination against Jews, not Jews and/or Arabs, which is the technical meaning of 'Anti-Semite'.) I actually love Jewish culture and I admire Judaism as a religion. Heck, at certain times in the past I've considered becoming a Jew.   Anyway!  I'm sitting in the coffehouse; sipping my coffee at a table. On the table, I have my books; a French synonym dictionary, and Jean-Paul Sartre's  ? Les Jeux Sont Faits ? , meaning, 'The Game Is Up', in the French. At that time, two Jewish gentleman walk in, evidently they have planned to eat lunch together. One I know is Jewish from previous conversations, and the other is wearing a  yarmulkah,  so I assume he is an Orthodox Jew. As the yarmulkah'd guy regards the table at which I am sitting, he sees the book.   He walks over and asks, "What is the title of that book?" "It's  Les Jeux Sont Faits ," I said, "By Jean-Paul Sartre."  He points to the word 'faits' in the title. "What does that word mean?"  "It means 'done'," I reply.  "So what does the whole title mean?"  "The Game Is Up."  "OH!" He exclaims. "Jeux means  games . How do you say 'Jew' in French?"  It is at this moment that I realise that he has inadverdently translated the title as 'The Jews Are Done'. "Umm... Juif."  "Oh! That's right.  Juif.  Merc?, merc? beaucoup."   LOL Oh boy. I was almost mistaken for an anti-semite. Damn Sartre and his ambiguous-when-looked-at-in-another-language-because-of-false-cognates-story-titles!! (Don't get me started on the misunderstandings I've seen people have over  Les Mouches .)   -Ian

      *shakes fist violently at Fox for cancelling  Wonder Falls *  I mean, damn, that was a great show IMO. The storyline was sophisticated (maybe a little too much on the irreverent side, but not bad, I think), the effects were good, the charecters were quite likable, the jokes were funny, so on- so forth- so whattathehell you havta cancel it for? What's it been on for, like two weeks?  Why is it that the cancelled shows always seem the most brilliant, anyway? Is that just our imagination, or are the TV companies set up in such a way so that all the really good shows get axed?   If so, why?  We may never know. -Ian

      Hmm, let me see if I can make the grammar a little clearer.    nulla   beha   koppa   dala  r   dala  t   dala  m  ke   ka   Now, three words in here are based off the same root: dala, or existence. The endings '-r', '-m' and '-t' are used to construct different types of concepts. '-m' indicates 'selfness', or proximity to the observer. All of what we would call 'nouns' in the language (though there is not a strict division between nouns and adjectives; they're all considered predicates to the all-important koppa verb) are indicated by the endings '-m', '-r', or '-rsi', which mark noun or adjective objects which are either 'self', (could indicate actual self, or possession) 'other', (things relevant to the second person) and 'distant other', an other more distant than 'you' and can generally be considered equivilent to he/she/it/they.  Now the '-t' ending just turns something into a participle, which are the Koppa equivilent of verbs. Verbs aren't constructed by putting the pronoun and participle by one another:    dala  m   felu  t   "I hoping"; rather they use the koppa verb to indicate the relation:   dala  m   koppa   felu  t   Now, word order doesn't matter, so that could be 'koppa dalam felut', 'dalam felut koppa', or whatever you'd like.   So 'dalat' is being. Also, what we would indicate with prepositions Koppa indicates with affixes. So instead of 'ke dalam', 'with me', Koppa says 'dalamke' or 'mewith'.   'beha' moves the relation indicated by the koppa into the future. So if the word being koppa'd is a participle, it moves the participle relationship into future time; 'dalam koppa felut' is "I am hoping", but 'dalam beha koppa felut' is "I will hope", or "I will be hoping".   Finally, the particle ka (as in Japanese) turns the sentence into a question and nulla negates the koppa. Therefore,   "nulla beha koppa dalar dalat dalamke ka" is  "Won't you be being with me?"  Make anymore sense? :)  -Ian

      nulla beha koppa dalar dalat dalamke ka dalam nulla koppa felut pelarsi dalar geha coppa fobat dalamma dalam coppa borat falamko ku dalam koppa felut pelarsi dalam koppa dubatki dalar koppa suremci'am   Idioms:   dalam nulla koppa felut pelarsi...  "I am hoping not the event..."  "I am hoping hope not that...(further sentence clause)"   The 'koppa':  Koppa: linking verb (like 'to be', but with no necessary implication of existence)   'Adverbials':  Nulla: negative adverb (not, or 'does not', etc.) Beha: Moves the linked relation into future tense (always right before coppa) Geha: Moves the linked relation into past tense (always right before coppa)   Roots:  Duba: See Dala: Existence Pela: Event Fala: Location Foba: Forget Bora: Wait Sure: Important   Affixes:  -ma: When appended, makes relation the object of a participle -r: Seperates the object from the observer; indicates an 'other': dalar is therefore 'other-existence' or 'you' in English parlance -t: Participle- no true verbs exist; only participles. Always "I am running", never "I run". Dalat is therefore 'being'  -m: Indicates the opposite of -r, in other words, the self. Dalam is therefore 'self-existence' or 'me' -si: Indicates object further distanced from the observed. Dalarsi therefore falls into the third person -ke: Is appended to word to indicate "with word", as in existing in close proximity,or joining in an activity together, not utilizing something as a tool.  -ko: Locative; "at word" -ki: "Be able to" -ci: Superlative (The Most, -est) -'am: "To me", "In my opinion" -'ar: "To you" -'arsi: "To him/her/it/they"   Particles:  Ka: Particle which turns sentence into a question Ku: "And"- links clauses of sentence, not individual words  Thus it translates to:    Won't you be being with me?  I hope that you have not forgotten me. I am waiting here and I am hoping that I can be seeing you You are the most important thing to me.

       Psi Spar Tournament Format    This post is going to explain pretty much every aspect Of the Up coming Spar Tournament. After interviewing all of the entries and seeing that I enough to run the tournament Im ready go fully in depth about how its going to work. So lets get jump right in.  Rules: These rules are put in for safety. Also to tell what is and what is not allowed.  1. No Kill shots(those are shots that are well meant to kill or do severe and permanent damage) 2. No body shots, that means if the persons shield is broken then the match is over 3. Once the match is over all attacks must stop 4. Pre-made attacks are allowed 5. Multiple shields are allowed 6. If you want to leave your body and go into the astral that is allowed 7. Its 1 on 1. Any outside help will be considered cheating and the perpetrator will be disqualified  8. Using External energy sources is allowed 9. A shield is considered broken when it: Has a hole in it, shattered, or any kind of opening for a construct to get through.   In the words of R. Dorothy Wayneright,   the things men do to amuse themselves.   -Ian

       Religion, Atheism, and The Meaning of Human Life     What is the meaning of life?   When people ask that, they don't literally mean, « What is the meaning of life? », they mean « What is the meaning of human life? », or perhaps even more specifically, « What is the meaning of my life? ». And by this we mean, am I stuck in a meaningless, absurd, Camusian universe, where all I can do is muddle through my sisyphean struggle? Or am I in the world of traditional religion, where I have meaning, and purpose, and rules by which I ought to live my life?  Most people find a middle-ground between these two positions- they sort of adopt a quasi-religious "God's in his heaven and all's right with the world" stance, where they believe in a God somewhere out there, but they don't bother to learn about him or rigorously evaluate their own actions to see if they are doing something contrary to His will. They don't pray or study, they just have this sort of passive belief and assume that their actions are more or less up to God's standards.   Then, there are pantheists and demi-atheists who, while disavowing a belief in God, nevertheless live by -- normally vague -- moral principles and derive what meaning they can by relationships with friends and loved ones, and by pursuing things they desire. Of course, there are more sophisticated breeds like Buddhists, who have pretty specific principles and disapprove of attachments to family, friends or material things, or Confucians (and their relative western equivilents) who emphasize social order, respecting authority, and relationships with family and friends.   On the two extremes are the devout and the hardcore atheists. Hardcore atheists aknowledge the camusian nature of our universe, and have resolved themselves to accept it- in all its meaninglessness, absurdity, and existential despair.   The devout, on the other hand, have taken the opposite approach and applied themselves vigorously to pursuing God, and as a result have made a thorough study of their religion's principles and prochedures, and have undertaken to implement them and, when possible, comitt them to heart.   In any case, of all these, could we say any were the meaning of life? We can eliminate harcore atheism, because it indeed leaves us in a state of meaninglessness- and demi-atheism and the 'easygoing religious' type only seem to go halfway, particuliarly the easygoing.   Full meaning can only be found in devoutness. Its opposite is the meaningless of hardcore atheism, and demi-atheism or the easygoing life only possess meaning in the sense that they resemble to that degree devoutness. Therefore, the meaning of life must be devoutness.  -Ian

      You know, I think it is truly a shame how Hollywood's(and therefore society's) standards of beauty have shifted to such an extreme.     Look at that woman. Granted, she ain't as pretty as a good Southern Belle, but she's still not hard on the eyes. She looks to be a decent weight, but how many photographers would dare let her wear a Bikini like that now? She couldn't even get a job doing those magazine covers I bet! Just a thought.  My Uncle has nothing to do at his place of employment on most days, so he and I often correspond. Here is an excerpt from what I wrote him on the movie  Bowling for Columbine :   I just finished watching this movie. I downloaded it online. It was pretty interesting. Obviously, Michael Moore's argument was way left, and he didn't exactly give the viewer a crystal clear, fair picture of the situation with firearms and violence, but who does? The only good point I think the film really made was that television and the media are the greatest threats we face in the country. The only thing more through-and-through evil, in my opinion, are big evil corporations like Wal-Mart. It was kind of funny watching him embarrass rich people like Kmart, Dick Clark and Charlton Heston, though I kind of felt bad for the last.   I also think Michael Moore exploited the victims of Columbine for his own malevolent purposes, but who is surprised by that? It was entertaining to watch, and if you haven't seen it, I recommend that you do.

      I should add to the  "minus boring blubbering females like in Gladiator"  part, that yes, the females in Troy were blubbering and red-eyed the whole time, but the difference is that in Troy they didn't really play such a big part. In Gladiator they tried to squeeze the Emperor's sister in there for some positive discrimination or whatever the motive was to create this useless character. In Troy, on the other hand, the females are there because Hector was married and Helen is ofcourse the character with the face so beautiful they launched a thousand ships. But the movie doesn't hide the fact that it's about the guys, and not about the girls, unlike Gladiator which was about the guys too but they tried to hide this by introducing a character for the ladies even though the ladies like sword fights too...  I understand what you mean, Gent, but I feel he did a good job (the best Pitt can do, that is) with what the script asked for. I also thought that Hulk was a horrible movie, Bana was in way over his head.

      I also do not like Brad Pitt, but unlike the comely lass beneath me, I have to mention that I did not approve of Brad Pitt's performance in Troy. The modern cinema simply does not understand the concept of the Greek Hero. Achilles is supposed to be a mindless killer, not some guy who, similar to Eric Bana in Hulk(A horrid film), but to a lesser degree, tries to act all "deep" and feel bad about being a mindless killer.  Wow...What a great day. I've just been sitting here at home all day. That's ok though, the Florida heat is absolutely blistering, and the humidity, well, you could fill a cup with it...  I killed 6 wasps! *Rebel Yell, Harley Noises, Other Redneck Sounds* I have done my part to make the world a cleaner, safer, and more employed place. What have you done? Hm?

       Troy: when men were still men and women were not    Disclaimer:  I'm not too good in writing movie reviews, I'm much better at bs-ing as you can clearly see by the rest of the posts here. Movie reviews are tricky for me, mainly because the reviewer doing the, well, reviewing has to  tell the truth . That aside, let's commence with my truthful and unbiased review of... Troy!  I walked in the theater expecting another  Gladiator . You remember  Gladiator , that impressive movie that was only impressive because it had been 40 years since someone last made an epic like that. We were so awed by the Colosseum and those cool sword fights that we didn't mind suffering through those incredibly dull talk scenes. We didn't mind that the only female protagonist was a blubbering nuisance and the so-called evil emperor was nothing more than a whining baby. But now is not then, and we sure as hell expect a bit more than Gladiator. Did they deliver, you ask? I'll answer your question... after this small commercial break!  I'm just joshing, guys!  Anyway, Troy can be described as Gladiator minus the boring talk plus the attack scene of the castle or whatever in the second LotR minus the stupid Legolas stunts plus Orlando Bloom, Brad Pitt and Eric Bana minus the fake  "trying to act deep"  Bana gave us in Hulk plus an impressive  "storming the beach"  scene a la Saving Private Ryan minus boring blubbering females like in Gladiator plus Brad Pitt.  I'm sure you noticed I mentioned Brad Pitt twice. This is not, as some of you might think, because I like him. I don't. I never thought he was such a good actor. The reason I mentioned him twice is to show how he delivered his role well against all (my) expectations, and to show that I don't like him. This logic makes absolute sense to me.  I'll conclude here, because I don't feel like continuing. Troy is impressive, dusty and has gorgeous fight scenes. The showdown between Hector (Bana) and Achilles (Pitt) is a dance almost. Sword fight choreography is getting popular again, and don't be surprised when we return to the same swashbuckling class and beauty that  Errol Flynn  used to deliver.

       My roommate has a fever.  I don't like sick people, they freak me out and are dirty. They also tend to stumble about in a feverish haze and could very well trip in your hallway and die. Imagine the hassle you'll have to go through trying to climb over their greenish, purple bodies every time you need to use the toilet. Sometimes a girl just wants to go poop without having to worry about decomposing corpses in her hallway. Will it ever end?!  Yesterday, my sick roommate was feeling a bit thirsty. "Snuffy (My real name, the name that was given to me by Jesus, our Lard, up in the Glorious Cloud Castle in the sky!)," she asked politely from her comfortable spot on the couch, "Would you mind getting me a glass of orange juice?"  "OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE," I replied, "DO I LOOK LIKE YOUR SLAVE, YOU CONDESCENDING WENCH?!" It seemed like a reasonable reply at the time. After all, I was busily involved in trying to figure out the intricate mechanics of a ballpoint pen by clicking it in alternating tempos. After trying to stab the pen viciously in my eye, she stomped off into the kitchen to get herself the glass of juice while mumbling incoherently.  I was feeling a bit sorry, so I tried to lighten the mood by making fun of pictures of her as a fat teenager and drawing little moustaches on them. She didn't appreciate my sense of humour and went into her room to sulk and curse my name. She can be such a baby sometimes.

       The Cranefly: Nature's Greatest Failure    urlLink Pic   Everyone agrees that the mosquito was one of nature's biggest messups. Stealthy, annoying, and as a common as air, the little vermin make havoc of any otherwise enjoyable Summer's night. Everyone is farmiliar with the itchy welts they leave on human skin, after having extracted their vampiric quota from our innocent flesh.   But truly, greater than this messup was nature's idiotic endevor aimed at correcting it, the skeeter-eater, or cranefly. Oh yes, promises of mosquito bodycounts per unit the size of summer tempratures themselves were the pledges of the skeeter-eater, but in fact they turned out to be one of the most defunct creatures ever produced.   The cranefly is probably the only hunter in nature that can be foiled by  dust.  DUST, people! Constantly you see the poor miserable flying defects caught up in a stream of dust that has attached itself seemingly inextricably to one of it's overlong, ungainly legs, causing it to fly around clumsily and frantically, hitting itself into things and generally making a colossal embarassment of itself. I've never seen what eventually happens to them, but judging by their charecteristics as creatures, one would have to make the assumption that they die in some isolated corner after crying their pitiable compound eyes out and cursing whatever cruel twist of cosmic fate left them to be the Tony Danzas of the insect kingdom.   What's more, the useless sacks of insect guts rarely, if ever, curb actual mosquito populations, judging by the stream of the diminutive draculas that swarm unemcumbered by nature's white knight in the cause of unmutillated skin and unravished banks of precious, life-giving blood.   If any other creature in nature possessed the sheer ineptitude of the cranefly, PETA themselves would not stand in the way of its accelerated extinction. Imagine a tiger gallomphing around the jungle, knocking itself into trees and finally dying in a shameful heap because a chunk of dust became ensconced in one of its paws! Who would question the wisdom of executing such tigers of the misery of their own absurd, Camusian existences? It would, in fact, be the most compassionate thing to do.   Moreover, the skeeter-eater has become such a colossal failure at hunting mosquitos, it has desisted even trying, and in one of the lowest survival strategies ever attempted in the light of biological day, the contemptible mis-machinations actually consume gunk to survive!  GUNK, people! The cast-off of the universe! The bottomest of the bottom-feed! Literally the most useless, repulsive, filthy substance known to have been created is the so-called skeeter-eater's filet mignon, the one thing in the universe which the sad, useless wastes of space can manage to consume.   In conclusion, we can only hope and pray that the undeterrable machinery of evolution works as expediently as possible (most likely through dust-related methods) to utterly extinguish the flame of the skeeter-eater from the universe, leaving the only knowledge of its short but excruciatingly pitiful chapter in the book of life to be a long-forgotten parchment squirreled in the recesses of a library devoted to such unbelievably boring subjects.   -Theo

The giant insects in the sky were treated to a feast of parents and relatives. Then we had to barrel down the backroads in the middle of the night. As bad a driver as I may or may not be, I'm already getting to the point I'd rather be driving than let someone else drive. I thought we were doomed for most of the trip.  Anyway, it wasn't all bad... We got to eat at Dairy Queen. ;)  BTW, Bacon is very good. Very good. The best. No meat is better. They should make bacon steaks.

      I don't like this new design. It t'aint easy on th' ahs.  I did some artwork today, but my image host's webpage will not load. It's a picture of a Toucan...He's standing up and looking at me. I drew his whole family. This pseudo-German, Dirk, killed one of his brothers...He was the Golf Bird though, so since Golf is a stupid waste of time, I decided to write it off as a mercy killing.  If any of you subscribe to magazines, may I suggest in the future you go to eBay to order them? The deals are tremendous, almost unbelievable. I highly recommend that you visit there.

       To move or not to move. My roommate and I were approached by a friend to perhaps share her apartment.  We're doubting, but there are a lot of good things about it:   --- The neighbourhood is better. Police actually dares to enter it at night, unlike the gang-infested "hood" we live in now.  See a photo of our neighbours.  --- It has a park! I love parks. Last time I stayed in that area, I recall music playing every evening around 6pm in that park. Lovely!  --- The apartment is bigger, and has old wooden doors, which is just cool compared to the new and cheap material apartment we live in now.  --- It's right next to the Plaza Mexico,  the largest bullfighting arena in the whole friggin' world . (50 000 seats, yo.)  Ofcourse, where there is good, there's always bad (that's philosophy for ya, Theo):   --- There is no subway entrance. One has to take a bus to get to the subway. Where we live now, there is a subway right around the corner. You need a subway if you don't have a car in a city of 20 million inhabitants.  See a photo of the few inhabitants of our apartment building at a party.  --- The building is quite old, therefore has no special earthquake architecture and magical building materials. And stuff. --- The park with the music has.. bugs. I'm not talking about cute little ladybugs or anything. I'm talking about mean, fat killer bugs that crawl all over your seats and start chewing your leg while you're trying to listen to some gentle muzak from the seventies.  See a photo of one of those bugs attacking a bus parked in front of the park.  --- The apartment is right above a restaurant, and  that can mean only one thing.

      2nd last day at work.  I expect it to be all pleasant, since I have only to cover some routine tasks, and bugger off - no upcoming projects whatsoever.  So in the morning I did my part of compiling the report for the meeting.  I was almost done before Colleague D (i shall refer to him as such) asked me for it.    Me: oh?  ah not down yet....I need to get the data from W (the office clerk). He: what?  And then you simply just sit around like an idiot and wait?  if she doesnt give it to you can't you go find out whats wrong? Me: *offended....what the hells wrong with him?* I get it from her around this time..oh shes just not around on her desk now anyway.....*still in well composed voice* He: dumb...I bet you never bother to find out why she was late?  Maybe she forget?  Maybe she was on MC?  Don't you ever bother?   ((WHAT THE HECK WAS WRONG WITH HIM?!?!?!?!  EVEN PROVIDED YOU NEED THAT FROM ME YOU JOLLY WELL ASK AND NOT YELL AT ME!))   Me: shes not late yet.....besides I have other stuff to do.....  *JERK..HE THINKS I WORK FOR HIM OR SOMETHING?!*  anyway a little later i grudgingly passed the stuff he wanted and add in the meeting:  ME: *soft whisper*  I REALLY DONT APPRECIATED GETTING A SCOLDING EARLY IN THE MORNING. -__- HE: WHA?!  *EYES WIDEN, I IGNORE HIM*  HE DIDNT LIKE IT, SO HE PULLED ME TO DA SIDE TO SETTLE THIS OUT OF THE MEETING.  HE: that was NOT a scolding!  HEY..if i wanna scold ya it would sound 10 times worse?! Me: -__^  (like you have the right to scold me eh?) He: FINE....go complain to your boss about me...feedback to him la....why bother telling me? me: look...I'm just looking for a bit of cooperation. HE: NOW WHOS NOT DOING DA JOB?  WHOS NOT COOPERATING????  Me: whatever...you do it then!  bye.   He doesnt know how to do it anyway and just cos it expects it of me hes acting like a jerk.  he also told my boss about me being insecere on another occasion.  aghhh...he can rot in hell!   Weirdo.  I'm leaving tomorrow.  Do I truly care what the shit happens to the plant?  NO!  I'm just passing time!  So with that kind of attitude I can simply dump the work aside.  ^0^

       Kinder Bueno: my friend, my love, my savior   Uncovering the secrets of world's most coveted candybar   As I am chewing it at this exact moment, I feel compelled to write about it. What is  it , you ask? It is the best cookie/candy bar on the market right now: the much desired and envied by lesser candybars, Kinder Bueno. While Twix, another loved candybar, comes in at nr. 2, it can never ever win from the coveted Kinder Bueno. KB has the crunchiness Twix has, yet nothing of the heaviness. It's a wonderfully light cookie filled with delicious hazelnut cream. Let's take a look at the pros and cons of both:   The pros of Twix:  relieves you of cravings; has a cookie; has chocolate; comes in two's   The cons of Twix:  has caramel; is heavy; while it relieves you of cravings, it still leaves you somewhat unsatisfied;  "Raider"  sounded cooler than the sissy  "Twix"    Conclusion:  one must admit that while Twix is delicious and very capable of relieving you of awful chocolate and nicotine cravings, its caramel can often be an obstacle to thoroughly enjoying the mix of flavours and textures Twix has to offer. The way it lodges itself around your teeth is just plain annoying. Now let's compare Kinder Bueno:   The pros of Kinder Bueno:  relieves you of cravings; is a cookie; has chocolate; comes in two's; has no caramel; is entirely filled with hazelnut cream   The cons of Kinder Bueno:  none   Conclusion:  as we compare both candy bars, we clearly see that Twix is no match for the superior Kinder Bueno with its creamy center and delicious crunchiness. Its sweet, nutty flavour light as a feather on your tongue, enjoyed by many around the world:      urlLink Visit the KB site  (in German) to support this cookie. Or  urlLink view a picture  of the cookie. Or  urlLink just go to Dr. Fungus  and make a fungal chat bot girl happy.

      What will you do if the new wallet you have bought spoil in the matter of a few hours.  Like when you just purchased it and the zip came out of it when you tried to insert some coins.  Will you consider that as "wear and tear"?  Or just a case of no-durability, or rather, a defective good?  I considered it as defective good, and since I was not too free to make the trip down to the store, I waited till one week.  The clause of the shop being, any good that was defective should be changed within 7 days.  Good, one week, 7 days.  When I got there, I was told a different story - 1 week later is considered the 8th day.  HELLO!  And plus they are unwilling to make an exchange - RULES CANNOT BE BROKEN DUH?  Well I pity the sales assistant, its not her fault.  And under the wallet's brand warranty, I should be able to get it repaired for free by the manufacturer.  But I don't want to wait!  Simply because I still think I bought a defective good!  However I notice that I cannot bargain for a better deal, and she had already consulted her manager to brush me off with servicing the wallet and I can collect it after X days.  (X is unknown of course, she said that depended on the manufacturing company itself.  CRAP!)  I told her I would like to speak to her manager - if she can't decide, I want to speak to the one that can.  She was hesistant, but I refused to leave.    Sales Assistant: My manager says no. Me: *smiles* I would like to speak to your manager. :) Sales Assistant: My manager has already instructed me that we cannot exchange for you. Me: *raised brow* I would like to speak to your manager.  Sales Assistant: *irritated* I already called her just now and she said no! Me: *more assertive tone now* I would like to speak to your manager.  Sales Assistant: *face darkened, and dials the number, hands over phone to me grudgingly.*  Although its not her fault I am most annoyed that she was only too happy to get rid of me with the "NOPE IM SORRY" excuse.  She was not at all emphathetic, like trying to imply I spoil the damn thing and I'm trying to cheat their company by refunding or something.  She took the stern approach and I dislike it.  She's in the service industry.  Heck she doesn't know much manners does she?    Manager: yeah? Me: I think your gal has already told you about the wallet incident? Manager: Nevermind I think its better for you to tell me what happened. Me: *Repeat my story.* Manager: I am sure my girl can tell the difference between wear and tear, or manufacturing defect. Me: Miss....its the zip that fell off....do you seriously think I have some cow-strength or something to pull it off like that?!!   Manager: .......... Me: It's only a week, even if you insist thats 8 days your shop did not specifically said so.  The instruction was ambiguous.   Manager: er..I will speak to my girl.  *hands phone to shop assistant.*  Sales Assistant: *exchanges the wallet with a bored look.*  Me: Thank you. *smiles*  Left the shop.

      Another thoroughly enjoyable day today. Mainly hung out at the coffeehouse and talked poetry/exchanged poems with some folks I know. Got a lot of intelligent criticism from this one guy I met just today.   Got to listen to the clarinetist again, which was quite enjoyable. Composed a poem on the spot, that I'm honestly a little iffy about, but I think it's decent. (Whitty insists the first two lines are elfen in nature.)  I also tried bubble tea for the first time today- it's pretty good. It has most of the refreshing qualities of coffee, but tastes a bit sweeter, and is more thirst-quenching. The taste's somewhat bizzare, especially at first, but it's good IMO.   Course, one of the funnest part was scoping out the cute Chinese girls who work there... Heheh...   -Theo

       I am a fungal, sentient chat bot from outer space   It's true. I've finally found out what my problem is. I used to think I was just filled with several anxiety disorders and phobias, turning me, basically, into a complete crackpot even though I have never smoked or owned a pot filled with crack. My first realization that something was up was when I got involved in a heated argument about extra terrestrial fungi; I defended the honour and dignity of this non-existant fungus with all my power.  The second clue hit me when a close pal of mine admitted to the world that I am, in fact, a chat bot. As I was trying to find a proper response for this dreadful accusation, my code got scrambled or something and I shut down left irc: Read error: Bot not Found strBotname=pocket.v002 (? version=002 encoding="utf-8" ?)  (Ping timeout)  This confused me. He knew all along and simply refused to tell me! This dropped me into dark pit of depression so I went out to buy myself a nice big pot of crack. After the high wore off, and I put my pants back on, I realized, denied and eventually accepted that I am indeed a sentient, fungal chat bot. Where the outer space part comes from, I don't know, but it sounds cool so sod off.

I also did good enough in math to skip past all the remedial crap and go straight into Algebra.  All in under 40 minutes!  Normally the test I took takes someone at least an hour and a half to finish and they don't do nearly as good.  Wanna know something even cooler?  I didn't study for it at all!  Was I nervous?

That being said, it goes:   Slattabutchedamfruckfudpucker!

      Had a real fun day on sunday; was too tired afterwards to blog it, tho'. But anyway... You're hearing it now. Stop complaing. :P  Anyway, my brother, his girlfriend, her room-mate, and her room-mate's son came down for a visit, which involved frogging (though not frog-gigging per se), canoeing, swimming, stargazing, and me teaching everyone (except my brother, who knew already) how to play Go. Had lots of fun and funny conversation.   Ironically, the one thing we never got around to was fishing, which was primarily what they had all come down for, heheh.   My bro's leaving sometime tomorrow :( Eh bien. I wonder if he won't be back in time for my birthday, which is on 17 July.   I have to grok math to ace my GED's and SAT's, so I'm studying it. REALLY need to bone up on my geometry, though my basic arithmetic and algebra are decent (more decent than I had thought). Hopefully I'll be shipshape within a week or so.   -Theo

      Went to a poetry recital today- it was pretty cool. They had a national poetry slam champ, as well as this lady poet everyone's always talking about- her meter's exquisite. Only strange thing was there were these two gigantic rertarded guys in the audience, who kept shouting at the most inoppurtune moments. One repeated over and over, "I got a poem! I got a poem!"- apparently laboring under the misapprehension that it was an open mic.   But that strangeness didn't adversely affect the enjoyment of the performance to any serious degree.   Anyway, while I did walk over there with some folks, I decided to go back alone (I was in a hurry), and it was sort of a sketchy neighborhood. So I looked around until I found a guy who looked like more of a mark than I did, and followed him out. I figured if worst came to worst they'd go after him before me.   Noble, aren't I? -Theo

      Hey Ya'll!  This is my second post as a blogger. The first being at my own just-created blog, SouthernGent's Dixiefried Text Dumplings. :-D  Your apparently fearless leader Theo invited me here. I'm obviously a Southerner, though not the Redneck I may appear to be. I live in Northwest Florida, and enjoy all manner good food and home shopping channels.  I enjoy talking about Politics, Current Events, Theology, Religion, History and Warfare. I'm quite practiced at writing those words too, because those are all the hot topics at my ezboard, which I've been operating since September 1, 2001.  Other than that, I think it may be fun to post here, and blogging will certainly be a new experience.

      I used to know an empty Coke bottle. It wasn't your average Coke bottle; it was completely made out of glass! Let me tell you the tale of this empty old glass Coke bottle. Back in the Dark Ages of the previous century, namely the fifties, people used to drink out of bottles that were made entirely out of glass. At least, I think so. It's rather hard to select a useful wad of information out of the nearly never-ending stream of inane bullshit that flows out of an old person's mouth. But I'm almost certain that in between heavy bouts of grim nagging about kids these days, immigrants and the weather, I picked up something along the lines of, "In my day, we drank out of glass. Not like you lazy kids these days, always drinking out of plastic. Now, in my day, we didn't do that. In my day, we..."  The reason I didn't continue the last sentence, is that I was unable to do so as I was in the middle of passing out from an overdose of slobber and gentle prune wafts that were constantly blown in my face. As I regained consciousness, I recalled the wise, and rather fetid, old man and his incredible tale of an empty glass Coke bottle that faced many dangers but, against all odds, reached its goal, and wiped away a tear that made its way down my cheek. When I moved to get up, I felt something push against my hand and glanced down. There it stood, proud and tall, the old Coke bottle. Awed, I picked it up and cradled it in my arms. Through streaming tears, I looked up at the sky and smiled. "Thank you, stinky old man," I whispered and lifted the bottle up towards the sun, drawing odd looks from passers by, "I will never forget this!"  I often think back to that hot afternoon. The one when the old man gave me, or I violently took it from him, I don't remember these silly details, the empty Coke bottle, and an angry scowl shapes my brow, for the afternoon was scorching hot, and yet, this selfish old fart refused to let me sip from his stupid Coke bottle. I'd love to tell you that the bottle and I remained very good friends, but, alas, I must disappoint you, as I threw it, in a fit of rage, against the curb. I recall its cries, which were all in my head, as I'm apparently nuts, for help as I clutched it tightly against my bosom and whispered I would meet it in the afterlife before I let it slip quietly from my grasp. Ah, the good old days, I say!

      Late night storytime with Sophie #1      It's been a week. A long week. Too long. Uh huh. I handled it pretty well. Too well. I'm supposed to be pulling my hair out and screaming. Can't believe I went 5 days without crying. Of course, I blew it when I said that and ended up crying. Eh.  I cannot sleep. I have bites all over my body and I've spent countless hours picking away the scabs.  outcome: itty bitty red scars Scars that will stay for another good 2 years or so.  Dammit. Some say scars add character. I sure hope so. I am one of those people that see beauty in what most consider ugly...things people don't notice. Like that old man...  The winter of 1990 was when I first saw him. I was about three or four (can't handle numbers and calculations at this hour...actually, any hour because I'm a fart head that failed math twice in my high school years). The indent on the south side of the Bon Marché department store building was where he played his accordion. He played beautifully. He had this tin cup on the top of the accordion. The sound of change clashing down made such a wonderful noise. Added spark to what he was playing. I only saw him during the winter time. He'd be out in his wheelchair, his arms shaking, eyes always closed (Was he blind? I will never find out!), his head bobbing up and down. It always made me sad to see that no one would stop, just for a brief moment, and admire his playing. I always watched from afar. The bus stop was right across the street. I gave him money. Made mom do it too. Wish others would, but everyone was too busy christmas shopping. I always wondered why he wasn't with his family. I wondered if he had a home at all. I wondered why I even gave a fucking shit about this guy. I didn't know him. I wondered why I couldn't be like the other kids. Just be happy playing with my toys. I wanted to be ignorant. Stupid and happy, fer sure. I would often sit alone in the corner of dad's work room or behind the lilac bush in my yard and just think. I thought so hard and long until it gave me a headache. Wisdom trips...reality checks...that's what those were. I was extremely mature for my age. Kinda hard to imagine, eh? With me nowadays going about, shouting "YYYYYYYYAY!" every chance I get. Silly me. I was more mature about sex when I was four than I am now. Ain't that a bitch? It's so funny. How did such a thing happen?!  Well, conclusion time now... Around '94 was the last time I saw him. He was in his eighties. I took a wild guess and assumed he died. Sigh...I will always remember good ol' accordion man. I will take his memory to my grave.  ZzzzZzzzZzzzZ  And that, folks, is how you make a birdhouse.  Goodnight.

      Hey Ya'll...  I haven't blogged in a while, so I'd thought I'd write a quick one while I'm online playing pool at Yahoo!.  It has been raining constantly for several days now. This became my good fortune today when I attended the Watermelon Festival up in Chipley. Since it was raining, it wasn't very crowded at all.  I had a Steak Burger from the Piggly Wiggly booth. Throw on some peppers and onions and it was right tasty. I didn't buy any Boiled Peanuts, though.  Proceeded into the auditorium and was very pleased to find that the lead singer from the old band Shenandoah was there along with his new bluegrass band. They really got down, and, being a big fan of the artform, I found the whole experience quite tantalizing. During their rendition of "Thank God I'm a Country Boy" I almost felt like jumping up and giving a good "Yeeeeeehaw!" One must understand, such thangs ain't all that uncommon when attending a good Southern concert. In fact, you might say they are almost expected! I was particularly impressed by the Mandolin player. I'd never before had the opportunity to hear one in person, and this particular player was quite skilled.  Anyways, before I left I picked up a bag of fresh ground corn grits and brought them home and cooked added them to my planned dinner. They go quite well with black beans, but then again, what don't they go good with? ;-)  Has anyone seen that movie "White Chicks"? What rubbish! Can you imagine them daring to do a similar film with white men called "Black Chicks"? The NAACP and Rev. Jesse Jackson would be up in arms!

      Blade Runner is on TV... Man I love that movie. Something about the cinematography, the music, and plotline... I find it all so surreal in the most lovely and impressive way. Surreal art is generally what I like the most- (though not surrealism the art movement per se) art that makes me feel like I'm somewhere else, and particulairly places that are strange and almost seem like they ought not exist.   If you've never seen it, it comes with Crazy Theo's reccomendation. ^_^

      Do you ever try to research something you remember only vaguely in the past, only to discover it's entirely different than what you remembered? Do you ever try and look for old and farmiliar things, and then be disturbed when they're not there, or totally different? It sometimes freaks me a bit how sometimes things and even people can drop off the face of the earth; and you never hear from them again. Careers suddenly end, and someone fades into the irrecoverable past; someone decides to reinvent themself, and no connection to their prior identity remains.  But isn't a psychological chafing against this sort of transistory reality pure vanity? Everything changes... Sooner or later everything fades and is gone. The present moment is the precious incarnation of something that will never, ever, be here again, whether we like it or not.   And every time we look away, we take the chance that when we look back we will be made known to this fact of reality... That when we finally turn back and check, that thing finally will be gone forever, as it inevitably must, and will never be back again.   It's like the shape of a cloud that we spy for a moment drifting across the sky; look back, and it may be gone, and no cloud will ever be like it again. When we all look back on our lives, will that be how everything seems? Something that was there for just a brief moment and then is gone forever? A hundred years, even living thousands of years in memory, is as brief as a snapshot... Eventually everything will be consigned to the oblivion from which it emerged.   Is this a sad thing? Is it really unfortunate? Or does it give all the more meaning to the moments we experience each passing day? Each one is beautiful, unique, and will never come again. And it's because of that that is has meaning and purpose; that it's important. It's the most critical thing in the world to look around us and apprecciate this cloud for what it is, because once it fades, we'll never have it again. All we'll have is the feeling of emptiness that it once filled, as we look for something farmiliar and find it's not there.

      Things I don't want to hear right now:  1. "Whatever, he's hella dumb." 2. "You were too good for him, anyway." 3. "There's other fish in the sea." 4. "You're young and you have your whole life ahead of you." 5. "Hey, (insert some boys name here) is kinda cute. What about him?" 6. "You will meet someone new in...THAILAND." (thank you, mother) 7. "HAHA, you're all ALONE!" (thank you, brother) 8. Bitching about problems you have with your boyfriend/girlfriend. 9. "You wanna smoke/drink?"  #'s 1 and 2 will get you a nice, firm bitch slap. Why? Because no one fucking talks about him like that. It's between us, anyway. The only person I really want to talk to about all of this is him. #'s 3-7 will get you the eye roll/middle finger combo. Those are either the most cliche, stupid or mean things one can say. # 8 will get you the silent treatment. Are you two still together? Yes, now hush. # 9 will get you get you a nice "Jesus is my savior" booklet. I have plenty of them saved up as a joke. Now you are the joke. I haven't had any booze (besides the usual sip) since March. I only had 4 cigarettes and half a Black and Mild that night. I don't want to chain smoke. Suprise, suprise, but I'm not addicted and I don't want to be. And as for weed. I don't want artificial happiness. I want to deal with this pain soberly.  I am giving myself two weeks to be hermit. It's best to get my feelings out immediatley, rather than act fake and tough. When people do that, they end up having mental breakdowns in the end. FUN! "For well you know that it's a fool  who plays it cool  By making his world a little colder" HEY JUDE! AMEN! I know everyone won't agree with me, but this is how I deal with things. I'm not giving up. I'm on a...vacation.  It's Psychology time! YAYYYYYYYYYYYYAYYYYYYYY! I wish I had more textbooks. I need history textbooks. I want me brainfood!!!! :boogie:  I could not sleep yesterday! I hardly ever get scared of movies but the Shining really creeped me out. Eww, that old nasty naked broad. !!!!!!!!!! BARF!!!!!  Haha, Tsedey said California sucks...except for the palm trees. Mmmkay, I wouldn't know.

      I find it so interesting that we broke up exactly 5 months after we met. *sigh* I'm quite fond of my new pics on deviantart. They and the lyrics express how I feel, what I'm going through. The weird thing is that I took those yesterday afternoon, way before we broke up. But I felt it...I felt this ominous feeling pass through my body and I bursted out crying. I started thinking about the dream I had about him. I got dumped and yelled at. Cold deals, it was. Another thing...I was messing around with my phone and Franks' info and stuff is in "secret" mode and I can't fucking open it. I don't know my user lock. I can't recall ever knowing my user lock. But it thought it was strange that it was his number. Maybe it implied that "You won't be needing his number, anyway." BOOO. Man, if I didn't see it coming, I probably wouldn't be dealing with this as well as I am now. For me, we parted when we had that break. It wasn't the same after that. But I tried. I fucking tried. I'm a lot stronger than I think...stronger than most people think. Then, I saw his pic on my wall and I said, "Goddamn." and I shook my head.  True story.  I can't stop crying. It's not really a bad thing. It helps me...releases the pain bit by bit. It's a mixture of sad and happy cries. Nostalgia has hit me hard again.  Oi, I need hobbies. :D Actually, the first thing I did after I talked to him was read my psychology books and all my foreign language dictionaries. My old loves have come back to me. But I can't possibly sit in my room and read those all day. :p I wish Tsedey was here. She's in California...she's finally gonna meet her love. I hope it all went well.  Suriyo is being such a bitch to me.  Madeleine made an account at communities! Now I have all my lesbos together on one site. Muahahaha.  GOSH! I'm so tired! I didn't sleep until 6 and I woke up at 10. First, I was trippin' about Franks and the heat was getting to me. I decided to write him a postcard. Felt better, got into bed... Woke up a minute later. I remembered that I ran out of frog food. The poor thing has been starving for 5 days! Then, I started getting mad about the user lock. I can't even add his number back into my phone 'cause it says that I already have an entry with his number in it. I had to put it in the memo pad. This is bull crap.  ANYWAY I got the greatest friends. People have been messaging me, asking me how I'm doing. I want to thank you all. And thank you Franks for being nice about all of this. I love you, comrade! (bah)

      Last night, I noticed a moisty spot on our bathroom ceiling. As I was watching it intently, I decided, in an inspired stroke of genius, to push the spot and poke it a bit, in the vague hope it would miraculously disappear. Instead, I successfully ripped off a large chunk of the ceiling, scattering pieces of plaster over the bathroom floor and into my eye. After shouting loudly that my eye was burning and I had lost my sight, I noticed noone was paying any attention to me and subsided. I continued to stare at the spot, that was now more of a dent, wondering what I should do about it.   I decided to talk to my cat, who was sitting next to me, licking his nether regions, about it. After explaining the situation to him, I awaited his reply. He stared at me. I stared at him. He continued to lick himself. I glanced back up and squinted my eyes in an attempt to give the impression I was reflecting upon a deep philosophical issue. Then, in a second stroke of genius, I stupidly decided to poke it again, and once more got covered in plaster. The dent that was once a spot, had turned into an almost gaping hole of darkness and brown inner-ceiling material. Fascinated, I peered at it, trying to uncover the mysteries of ceiling material, and went on my merry way some seconds later, as I have the attention span of a candy bar wrapper.   The next morning, I urgently needed to relieve myself, as is common for earth-bound creatures to do. As I was sitting there, staring in front of me with my usual toilet expression; mouth open and eyes glazed over, humming a tune from Mary Poppins, I heard my neighbours above me flush their toilet, and snickered a bit at this odd coincidence. It was then I felt a cold liquid run over my back. I jumped up with a loud howl, and looked up. The gaping hole I created was leaking! I don't even want to know with what, but I guess I'll have to deal with this nuisance somewhere in the near future, like when I move out and let my roommate know about it.

        Kae:  What is it that the Catholic church has done lately?  Theo:  According to my grandma (who is a devout Catholic) her church has mandated that anyone who votes for Kerry cannot take communion due to his pro-abortion stance  Theo:  Now granted I think abortion is wrong... But to make this all about ONE issue is painfully shortsighted in my opinion  Theo:  Bush has done stuff contrary to catholic doctrine as well... Why don't they pick on folks for voting for him??  Kae:  You know it's things like that, that always turned me away from that particular religion. It is run with so much internal politics that it doesnt even seem like a religion at times. More like a presidential run.   Theo:  Better yet since almost every candidate supports something contrary to catholic doctrine, let's just have NOBODY vote  Theo:  I dunno man  Theo:  It sours me   This really does piss me off. Now granted I accord totally with the church's position that abortion is wrong and a regrettable destruction of human life... And in a sense I don't completely disagree with their moving towards making this a battleground issue and seperating the wheat from the chaff of catholic believers on whether they can tow the line on this issue.   HOWEVER, to make their political involvement so completely focused on one issue will have horrendous consequences, I feel. Yes, stopping or at least curtailing abortion is important. But what about getting us involved in WARS which the pope himself seemed to indicate were wrong? Isn't that important when we're sending grown men to kill and die? Isn't that a sin too?   So why the one-sided focus? Why pick on the sinful policies of one candidate and let those of another slide? You think God plays favorites with some sins over others? Are not the wages of them ALL death?

      Ms. Lynch gets the coolest teacher of the year award. GO, MS. LYNCH! FELLOW BEATLE FAN WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE She's bumpin' Stevie Ray Vaughn. She's the only teacher that be playing music in class. THAT IS WHY SHE RULLLLLLLLLEEESSSSSSSSS.  I was the only person in first period! I feel like such a square. I'm actually going to my classes. Heeyyyy...I don't think any of my friends are here. :(  Awww...Tiffany gave me a rose. What a sweetheart! OOOOH and there's a really cool tiny white bug in it. It has teeny black dots on it. What a pretty bug. ^_^  Arf...I'm bored.  I went to the Columbia City theatre. It's not a bad place at all. I thought it was gonna be shitty and have bad sound and picture quality, but it was very nice. It's about time we got a theatre down in the south end. I saw the Stepford Wives with Emily and her mom. It was funny...and a little creepy. I don't like robots...and the whole 1950s housewives thing. They're just...hella burnt. Anway...after the movie, we went to Walgreens to develop my pics. It took an hour! First, I was waiting for someone to fill the machine with paper. Then, I waited over 10 minutes for nothing. I thought the pics were printing, but nooooooooo. The computer froze. Then I got help and the pics printed out. I bought them and left. When we were a block away from the store, I took out the pics to look at them. The edges were burned and ripped!!! So, I went back and printed them again for free, of course. I always have bad luck when I get my pics printed out. It always takes so dang long.  I gots to go shopping! The Orca reunion is on Saturday. I need to look bomb, man...and I hope I'm going with all my friends as a group. I can't wait to see everyone! Especially them crack hoes. Uh huh. And if someone rolls their eyes at me, we're gonna have some problems. I'm not even playing. I should have done something a long time ago.   EWWWWW! Ray took a pic of me and I totally blinked. I am looking oh so butch and unkemt. :D

      "Blood was always on our hands; we were licensed to it. Wounding and killing seemed ephermeral pains, so very brief and sore was life with us. With the sorrow of living so great, the sorrow of punishment had to be pitiless. We lived for the day and died for it. When there was reason and desire to punish we wrote our lesson with gun or whip immedietely in the sullen flesh of the sufferer, and the case was beyond appeal. The desert did not afford the refined slow penalties of courts and gaols." -T.E. Lawerence (aka Lawerence of Arabia),  Seven Pillars of Wisdom

      Since I was pretty hungry and didn't feel like working anymore for a while, I went into the kitchen to prepare my Sponge Bob instant macaroni (ready in 14 minutes!) when I noticed a small, dark intruder. While I let my cheese sauce bubble a bit, I slowly sidled up to my new little buddy to inspect it more closely.   "Why, hello there, little friend!" I said with a chuckle. I tried to pet it, but when I brought my finger closer to him, he backed off and cringed in fear. "Don't be afraid!" I whined rather pathetically, "I'm your friend! Please let me be your friend. plz." But to no avail; my pleading fell on deaf ears. I sighed softly and tried once more, fully expecting my new little pal to walk away or die instantly of fright because I'm so scary looking and stuff, instead it did something completely unexpected: it jumped!   Even though that scared the living shit out of me, I usually go out of my way not to kill any bugs, and try to give them freedom. This is not because their smeared carcasses are just really disgusting, but it's because I have a healthy amount of respect for all things living. I believe that every animal, no matter how small, should have the right to get married and live a good life without me trying to destroy it because they frighten or disgust me, which is why I wish someone else would just kill the fucking bastard and get it over with.

      We made up yesterday. I'm still loved. :') Two months with my babeh. MUAH! >. hee hee  After school yesterday, Lily and I went to Mekong and I got some Thai food. Then we walked to Joseph's work place. I got a bunch of people to sign my yearbook. Kevin gave me a condom and told me to be safe. Aye, aye. I'm taking a pic of it. We went to the theater...blah blah... !!!! The movie was sooo good. It was HILARIOUS. I was giggling the whole time...it's funnier if you understand Thai people, their way of talking and joking around... It was sad too. It starts out with the protagonist's sister getting killed in a terrorist attack...and his niece gets hurt.  Anyway  I loved seeing the skanks. And now I know what the whole thing about the trousers is about. Hella dumb...   Checking up on Shanelle...  Me: Did your dad yell at you last night? Shanelle: No. He wasn't home. Me: Hmmm...I bet he was with his little girlfriend. Shanelle: I found an orange condom filled with white stuff in his bathroom garbage. Hecka nasty. Me: Ooh, fun.   Emily and Tsedey came over last night. We watched Dead Presidents. I took pictures of them on the roof. There's a picture of Tsedey holding a water bottle and Emily is trying to...you know...suck on it. We're the sickest group of girls you'll ever meet. We don't actually do shit, but the things we say aren't very ladylike. Not a minute goes by without one of us saying "Suck my dick, bitch.". I told Tsedey...nevermind. Too stupid and embarassing.  Tsedey's always licking people....Emily's constantly spacing out...I'm...what do I do? Oh, I'm the mother, the photographer, cook, AND the pimp (Madame Toureille, thank you very much). Not self proclaimed. They know I am. They are my ten cent hoes. They can do anything...and anyone. I love my hoes.

      I feel like I'm talking to myself. It's really not as fun as the crazy people make it sound like.  My ego is growing.  I'm thinking of running for president of the Laotian club (I'm sick of being a secretary that doesn't do anything). Yeah, I'm not Laotian, but quite frankly, I don't give a sheeeeet. No one else wants to step up to the plate. Our current president just graduated and vice president Lily doesn't want to do it. Everyone else is too lazy. I believe our club needs a leader with a sense of humour and brilliant (muaha) ideas. Someone that will take initiative. I see myself there. I will be there. Hmm....Suriyo will be in the club. Brother and sister. How sweet. This is such a bold thing for me to do. Again, I'm the shy one surrounded by...non shy people...and yet the only one that will speak up.  I'm tired of it. I'm moving on.    http://www.seattlefilm.com/film/results.aspx?country=Thailand  Baytong  THAILAND, 2004, 103 minutes  Language: Thai  North American Premiere  An unpredictable and ultimately heartwarming drama with an unlikely comic touch.

What about trousers? :p That's the movie I'm gonna go see with the Laotian club after school.   Me:I'm going to see a Thai movie after school. I'll be home at 8. Mom:Uh huh. No, you're not. Me:Hee hee. Bye! :D  ...  She can always call the cellphone. :p    Oooh! and there's three other Thai movies playing.  The Tesseract  THAILAND, 2003, 97 minutes  Language: Thai and English  Four story threadsa female assassin, two warring drug cartels, an Englishman paid to mule heroin, and a child psychologist studying the dreams of street childrentangle and fray in this stylish thriller from Oxide Pang, co-director (with his twin brother) of past SIFF favorites Bangkok: Dangerous and The Eye. Other Producing Countries:Japan, United Kingdom Awards: Sitges 2003 (Best Cinematography)   6ixtynin9  THAILAND, 2000, 114 minutes  Language: Thai  Hugely entertaining, action-packed comedy.

When I was walking home with Shanelle yesterday, we saw some old Asian lady with a cigarette in her mouth and all this smoke was gushing out...like she didn't know how to smoke the damn thing. I burst out laughing. That's so mean...I think she was too into what she was doing (or not doing) to notice that we were laughing at her ass. FUNNY SHIT, though. It would have been the coolest picture. Dammit!!! Oh, and this other time at Walgreens, this guy had his butt crack showing. Okay...understatment. His whole cheeks were hanging out. Nasty.

      Thank you, Theo, for inviting me! I hope I keep up with this journal. I have about...8 other journals...and only one of them is updated everyday. Well, the name's Sophie. Sometimes I go by THE Reverend Jojo Jenkins (long story). AND yes, I am Sylvie's sister.  In a nutshell, this is what has been going on in my life lately: ~Boyfriend drama. I fucking blew it. I always mess stuff up. I love him. :'''( ~Went to Tsedey's friend's memorial service. I've never seen a dead person before. ~Shanelle was (or still is?) feeling suicidal in 3rd period yesterday. I told her how much I love her and that I wasn't gonna let her do that. She says she's okay now. :-S  http://toureille.deviantart.com/ That's where my journal, art and photos are.  I'm not in a very good mood, so that's all for tonight. Nice meeting you all and have a goodnight.  :]

       Pull my ear   I guess you think I'll be saying some vulgar joke now, or perhaps even let one rip. I won't. Although I am only human and at times do let one rip, today's post "Pull my ear" will not be about farts. Today's post will be, on the other hand, about how I singlehandedly pulled my ear right out of its socket, providing ears are, in fact, located in sockets. I don't know. I'm not a fancy doctor like some of you may claim to be to avoid threats of malpractice.   I felt a slight itch. A slight one, peeps, I do wash myself at least twice a month by jumping around in random puddles during rainy season. I felt this itch and the only possible course of action I felt I could take to stop this itch was to pull my ear. In retrospect, it wasn't such a good idea.   As I am writing this post from the waiting room in the hospital while I am waiting for the doctors to attach the silly thing back to my head, I think back to that afternoon: the one where I pulled my ear right out of its socket, for those of you who are a bit slow. I knew I was in trouble when I heard it go snap somewhere in the fuming pits of my external auditory canal as I pulled it. You might wonder now if I pulled the stupid thing by attaching it to a wire, which was, perhaps, in its turn attached to a raging bull. Not at all, all I did was gently tug the lobe in question, expecting the itch to pass and perhaps migrate to a more suitable location, such as the tip of my nose. I assumed that, after the gentle tugging, my ear would comply with my reasonable demands and give me what I want. I certainly didn't expect it to give up so soon without a proper fight!

      My latest cinema conquest is Brother Bear, from Disney. I do believe I heard that is was the last fully animated flick that company will release. The death of an era. :( I thought it was a good film overall, and I was even inclined to laugh out loud once or twice(no more). I didn't like the ending though.   SPOILER!    In the end the protagonist decides to remain a bear to take care of the little bear he orphaned. I was sitting here in agony, screaming, "No you fool! Turn back into a human! Be human! Bears don't live as long! Nooo!" ... Cotton' pickin' furball. ;)  I had more to talk about, but I plum fergot.

      I've been watching a ton of movies lately. I was just arguing with Theo on the merits(Or lack thereof)of apocalypse Now. I thought movie was rather poor in quality while Theo loved it.   Yesterday I watched Amelie. It was a very nice change from all the blood-and-guts war films I've been watching.  It was in French(with subtitles), a welcome change. Audrey Tautou starred and, wow, what a cutie! I was entranced by her beauty, only magnified by the fact she was speaking those cute little French words from her pretty little mouth. Oui Oui indeed!  The film itself was incredibly clever and laugh out loud funny at many points. Have ya'll ever seen the online travel site commercials on television with the little Yard Gnome in all the pictures? Well, I do believe that those commercials are a homage to this film and one of its many humorous subplots. This was a true "feel-good" romantic comedy, and, being a devout fan of such films, this was a true treat. It had biting realism mixed up right along with fairy-tale innocence.  I don't feel the need to tell you the plot, since you can easily find out that information elsewhere online should you so choose.  Take a look at Miss Tautou:    She's a real darling isn't she? I'm not trying to objectify women here, but she's simply entrancing. Talk about eyes you could drown in!  While I'm typing, allow me to voice a complaint as a Southerner. I am currently reading a book called "Ice Tea and Elvis: A Saunter Through the Southern States" by Nick Middleton. The author, an Englishman, barely steps off the plane before he starts criticizing the South on problems both real and imagined. You'll find no positive thoughts in this book, but I digress. My problem is with the title. First of all, it 'taint "Ice Tea", it's "Iced Tea"! In any case, few folks order "Iced Tea" in the South. We order "Sweet Tea" or "Unsweet Tea". It's all black, and it's all iced!  Secondly, I wasn't privy to the knowledge that Elvis was a Southern icon. He was from here, sure, but wasn't he more of an American icon with his Rock-N-Roll and Hip-Swinging? If you want a  real Southern icon, look at Lynyrd Skynyrd, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Hank Williams, etc.

       A Birthday Carol    By Pokey Dickens         't Was on this night: to begin with. It was on this night, the night of my birthday, Saturday June 5, that I was visited by a spirit. I shall now tell the story of how my life was changed.   After I had checked every orifice and cranny in my apartment, I sat down satisfied to eat my left-over pizza. There was only one slice left, and it was an unfortunate thing that it was a slice from my roommate's pizza: Hawaiian.   "Humbug!" I scowled at it as I heard a clanking noise; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain. I then remembered to have heard that ghosts in apartments were described as dragging chains. The balcony door flew open with a booming sound, and then I heard the noise much louder, coming straight towards me.   "Mercy!" I said. "Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?"   "Woman of the worldly mind!" replied the Ghost, "You will be haunted by the Spirit of Time and Old Age. Expect it at the hour of midnight. Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us!"   When it had said these words, the spectre took my slice of pizza from the table, looked at me with a wicked grin and vanished into thin air.   "Humbug! Choke on it." I muttered and went straight to bed.   When I awoke, the clock had already struck midnight. "The hour itself," I said, triumphantly, "And nothing else!" I laughed heartily. Just I prepared to return to bed, my eye caught a peculiar, sparkling object on the nightstand. Confused, I reached out and grabbed it by the handle. As I brought it closer I saw a horrible thing!   What was mirrored back was not my once appealing face, but a face haunted by age and time. It looked withered and gray. I watched in horror as wrinkles were being carved and bags were formed under my once exuberant eyes. The hairs on my head that were once a golden brown curled up, as if in shame, and turned an ugly white.   "Why?" I cried, "Why must this happen to me! How can I live in this young, fast-paced world now that I have turned, on the 5th of June, the old age of 23?!"   And so it was, PocKet's birthday carol. May we be blessed enough not to experience anything dreadful such as that. May that be truly said for us, and all of us! And so, as the mirror observed, God Bless Us, Every One!

       Five Steps... to being a good teenager   As I was surfing through some blogs, I noticed that most blogs here are owned by teenagers. Now don't get me wrong, I don't dislike teens or anything. Hell, some of my best friends are teenagers!   Well, no, that's not true.   But I can accept a teen in my heart if I truly must, like when I am forced at gunpoint to swallow living HIV infected puppies pierced with rusty nails. I've also noticed a peculiar thing: all teenagers are alike. Now I can start blabbing away at how when I was that age, I was much more superior and sophisticated, and while this is partly true, I do realize I was guilty of some of the very same things that makes me want to hurl when I read these dumbass blogs. I present to you: five easy steps to become a successful teenager!   Hello there! Yes, you! Are you bored with your happy life? Love your parents, teachers and school? Do you wake up with a smile on your face every morning? Have no fear, for I am here to make you hate, cry and fall in love at the drop of a hat. I bring you: The Complete Guide to Being a successful Teenager!  Only $55.95. We are not responsible for extra sunny mornings, please  read our policy .     Step 1: hate school  No matter how many friends, good grades and fabulous teachers you have, you must absolutely loathe going to school. School is nothing but an absolute regime created by a totalitarian government to hold down the people and collect your hard earned allowance to squander on weapons and cannons and stuff! Bad president! Bad!   Helpful tips to achieve step 1: listen to System of a Down.     Step 2: life isn't fair!  You know we are all out to get you. This isn't a mental mirage created by your immature and hormonal imbalanced mind. The world truly hates you. There is noone on this planet that has it worse than you do. There is no fate worse than not having enough allowance to buy you those new Calvin Kleins or being able to stay out until the wee hours of 2am! It just isn't fair!   Helpful tips to achieve step 2: listen to Limp Bizkit.     Step 3: be lonely and sad and write some poetry about it  Since the world is so unfair to you, (see step 2) you can't help it but feel depressed and lonely. It seems nobody really likes you, no matter how hard you try. Not even your parents do. Nobody understands. It's a lonely world and the only way you can cope with this new found concept is to write some gloomy poetry about it. Some examples of successful teenage poetry:  "fear...darkness...life // no longer will i live here // no longer will i laugh and love // i understand now // fear...darkness...life // take this bullet // i end it here // all is dark // fear...darkness...life"   Helpful tips to achieve step 3: listen to The Cure.     Step 4: never talk or spell like a normal human being  EvEn iFF u r a v3rii kL3Vah t33nagah and noe da pRoPa way ta sp3ll  "words,"  u, lik3, cann0t aLl0w ne1 ta fInD dis 0ut! It is cr00cial ta ur survival as a t33nagah dat u pr3t3nd ta b an abs0lUt3 3mptii aIrh3ad wit no sp3lLing skillzZzZz whats03vah, d00d.   Helpful tips to achieve step 4: listen to Eminem.     Step 5: whine about suicide but never actually do it  There is no teenager more successful than the one who threatens to kill him or herself. Why struggle through this empty, harsh existence? It's not worth it. It's not fair and nobody understands. Just end it. I will! I'll do it! RAISE MY ALLOWANCE OR I WILL KILL MYSELF! I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! DON'T LECTURE ME, I WILL NOT CLEAN MY ROOM! WHY ARE YOU SO UNFAIR!   Helpful tips to achieve step 5: listen to Britney Spears.    I hope this helped you a bit in your quest to become a good teenager. If you are already a teenager, but do not feel any angst, then you simply are not normal and I suggest you start threatening you hard working parents with suicide.

       Tomorrow   Have you ever thought  -perhaps-  That the reason you love tomorrow  is  because it's a day away?  Tomorrow, tomorrow  We owe nothing to tomorrow; Tomorrow is out of our hands. Unlike the past, which speaks so sorely of our irrevocable  responsibilities;  Or the NOW, With it's confrantational assertion of  duties , Tomorrow asks nothing of us. It whispers sweetly in our ear like a tease,  Oh, take me, take me!   Spinning tales of pleasures on pleasures All promised in due time. It gives us descriptions of all that we'll have, Yet shows us nothing. Tomorrow is a  flirt,   But she flirts so well. When it comes time for tomorrow to give us -what we have been promised- To reveal what she has promised to, She is already  now , not  tomorrow  And Now is a different thing entirely. Now is  demanding;  She is  concrete;  She is where our duties live. Now is the trash waiting to be taken out; Now is the study-books unread on our nightstands;  Now  Is a very high-maintenance girl. So we find not  Tomorrow  but  Now  in our arms, Kissing us and instituting what Tomorrow promised, While at the same time making all these  -all too realistic-  demands. So we hold  Now,  yet we wonder Whatever happened to that flirty tease  Tomorrow ? We love  Tomorrow;  But she's always a day away.

      I scared a little girl today. It was the saddest thing. I was by the Benaroya Hall and this little Asian girl, maybe 7 years old, had a sad puppy dog look on her face. She grabbed her mom and hugged her as I was walking towards her. I didn't do anything! :( I checked the mirror (I didn't look like a complete beast today), I wasn't smoking at the time, and I didn't look at her weird. I did kinda smile, though, 'cause she's fucking corny for looking at me like that. What a punk ass kid. Maybe my all black attire scares people and animals. Who knows? I don't care.  School was fun. We read more stuff about Heidegger. 8-)  There are so many old pictures I took earlier this year that I want to upload. The ones of Tsedey especially. Those rule.   "Quel laid je suis/ Cependant je suis entouré de la beauté" = What an ugly man I am/ Although I am surrounded by beauty   BOO TO THAT THEO! :( I really did cry. Don't make me cry. You're so sweet! and I think you're full of beauty, love. That means a lot...'cause I only call my best friends beautiful. Yeah, the cool kids. Now...you're a cool kid too. Welcome to the club. Hope you get to call me soon. :) Muah.  Well...I bought some hair dye and I'm gonna get that done...and watch some movies I rented.   Beep beep.  Theo: http://www.thinkgeek.com/index.shtml Theo: LOL yup Theo: Since you're a sapiosexual that must be like a porno store for ya Me: Please hold. Me: *mops up drool* Me: back! Theo: LOL Theo: hahahahaha Me: ..........;-).......... Theo: -_^ Me: ^_- Me: Swiss Memory USB?!?!!?!?!?! Theo: hehe Me: =-O Theo: ?_? Me: Ahhhh, there's way too much sex on that site.

      Okay...here's my list for today:  Sleeping pills (well, it's not actually a sleeping pill. It's a night time cold pill...but it turns you into a sleepy muthafucka) are the devil. Makes body feel wobbly and head feel trippy in the morning. MUST not forget the smokes. Drink coffee or tea every morning. I will not hit the snooze button. Snooze button is a dirty whore and wife of the devil.   Other than leaving the cigs at home (!!#%$%^$%#!!!!!), today was great! I found the 15 bus stop. Wasn't hard at all. It's right by the Seattle Art Museum...and it's in front of the Lusty Lady. ;) I did have to wait a while for the bus to come. :( That's what the cigs are for! Killing time. :( Well, I got there an hour early! :-o I think it'll be that way till the end. I'm paranoid about taking a later bus...I don't trust public transportation. You're only allowed to have 2 absences or 6 tardies (tardies=each less than 20 minutes late). That's boo boo. I will not be late-ever. I don't really like the inside of Ballard. There's one big hallway and little hallways that branch from it. I couldn't find my class at first. *sigh* BUT I did, of course, and my class rules. The teacher seems awesome. Mr. B. is what he goes by. He's looks Indian, but he's Spanish and Jewish. I thought that was pretty cool. He's so funny, though. We wasted the first 45 minutes of class on...just...blabbering. And he knew it, too. He kept looking at the clock every 5 minutes and he'd say, "Look, I've just wasted 15 minutes. Am I good or what? :D" !!!!! People are so cute. I love it. The kids in the class seem...interesting. I really want to get to know 'em and stuff, but most of them seem so...unaproachable. I hope I don't seem that way. I'm always smiling and laughing. I don't think I look mean. I look like a teacher's pet, though. @_@ I like that the classes are racially mixed. I think it's the most diverse class I've ever been in. 8-) We're starting with Philosophy. We read a book about Martin Heidegger. Cool stuff. I learned something. Glad 175 bucks didn't go down the crapper. :) I can't wait until tommorow!!!!!!! I'm such a dork.

      Okay Ya'll, I've got a new film recommendation for all of ya.   Today while folding my laundry I took the time to watch  Bend it Like Beckham  which I *ahem* "acquired" from the world wide web. ;  I was surprised by how much I like this movie revolving around that most loathsome of sports - soccer. The acting was exquisite and the laughs were numerous. I'd suggest all of you go rent a copy like decent citizens of your fine respective nations and city states. ;)  It also doesn't hurt that the two leading ladies were so luscious!     That's Parminder K. Nagra. I've always had a soft spot for an Indian face, and Miss Nagra is a real beaut.     Of course. The gorgeous Keira Knightley needs no introduction. :-D Girls with British accents are so sexy!

Asia, like, called me this morning, all sad and stuff. She asked if she could come over. Now what did I say? I said "Sure!" 'cause I love my buddies. She'll be here at 7:30.  I need to eat. I missed breakfast and lunch 'cause I slept in again.  Okay, Aaron wants me to go to the store with him.  I might not be back online.  WHITEY THE RASTA is out.  Peace.  :::I hope I take nice pictures of the firecrackers tonight. :)

Theo: LOL Theo: Single-finger or touchtype? Me: Wha? Theo: Do you hunt and peck with two fingers or can you touch type? Me: Is touch type the right way? Theo: In theory O:-) Me: Yeah, I do that. Me: If I did the hunt and peck thing, I'd beat my own ass. Theo: LOL Theo: I hunt and peck Me: I'll beat your ass too. Theo: LOL Theo: That sounds like a challenge :-D Me: I AM WOMAN! HEAR ME YARRRRRRRR! Me: YARRRRRR Theo: LOL Theo: ^_*  Seriously, Theo. I'm going to Missouri...and I'll visit some meth labs first and THEN...I'll beat your ass. And you're still gonna take me out for coffee. We'll go back to your place and I'll steal you kimonos. Why? 'Cause I'm mean. =|  ____________  Today (or yesterday, I guess) was really awesome. I woke up at 2:30 pm (how in the hell...). Suriyo left home to sleep over at Aaron's. I think their plan was to buy fireworks. We'll see when they get home.  Maddy called me up a short while later and asked me if she could come over. I said "Sure!" 'cause I love having company over. We watched some Sonic Youth and Blondie videos 'cause I was totally rocking out and being bad ass and shit before she came over.  :lol: I felt like going outside and asked her if she'd like to go to the lake. She agreed as long as we went to El Taco Stand first. We did. We got to the lake and we took some pics. Really awesome ones. She looked bomb, as always. I...no. Just no. I was a mess. My hair? Sticking out in all directions. Okay, okay, I looked like a cute kid. :aww: [Gotta hug and comfort the ego once in a while.]  We got home, edited her pics, and then we walked to the 39 bus stop. I had a weird feeling...'cause the 39 doesn't run late at night during the weekend, but she checked the schedule, and she said it did. We smoked some cigs on some person's steps (sorry, kind neighbour). Oh wait! Before that, we saw Tim and he shouted out of his car "No smoking!" CUTE! but no. Some other kid we knew from elementary school walks by with his friends and he tells me to stop smoking. !!!!! Where's the love? Really... So, we're like waiting for the bus, and I'm still feeling skeptical and I check the bus schedule. She read it wrong. She read the morning schedule. It was 9:30 and the last bus came by at around 6! I was too into my cig to be angry at her. No biggie. I was totally chillin' and she was too. We walked down the street to the 7 bus stop. During the long wait, we had an intelligent conversation...something I never get to do. :(  Man, I was so deep and she understood what I was saying. Social issues get me going like a mofo. We always talk about that kind of stuff and that's one of the reasons I love hanging out with her. I seldom have serious conversations with any of my best friends and this is really nice for a change. I hope I can do it with all of my friends...someday. I don't think I want to talk about it on here 'cause it's about race (black people! eek! white people! eek!) and y'all probably don't know what I'm gonna say anyway and I don't have the will power to argue with you internet folks.  Aw, what?! It's four already?! Hey, I didn't even wash my face yet. I've had this make-up on for 12 hours. I'm gonna break out. NOOOOOO!!!! I will use all the wonderful beauty products I can find in my room. Muahaha.  And that's how Toureille escaped her certain fate.  Wha...I don't know what I'm saying. I'm just like...writing everything that's going on in my head. I'm actually like half way asleep. And I keep saying "and" and "like" like way too much. I don't know if that made sense.  And I'm feeling like I'm high off my ass.  I love love.  Even though I lost some love recently, I still love love.  That's good.  *sniff*  *tear*  Okay, I want my bed now. ZzzzZzzz...

      I have two more days left to be a hermit crab. After that, no more staying up till 5 in the morning and sleeping in past noon. Not even for the man of my life, Conan O'brien.   Tsedey woke me up this mornin' (I know you're gonna read this, sweetie pie!) and she said she was gonna call me back and she neva did! I woke up fer nothin'. >.  I finally got out of bed at 1:30. Took a shower, got ready and headed for Asia's house. We went to Starbucks 'cause she had a buy one get one free coupon. Those are fun. Love those. I got a scarf from the cute little Jamaican store. The guy there was so friendly. Ate at subway. Went to the theatre. Watched Spiderman. Smiled at the lovely kids that made fun of the kissing scenes. I totally feel them, man. It was so nasty. Laughed at MJ 'cause she's such a dork. Felt bad because MJ reminds me of self. Nodded and agreed with all of Asia's comments on the movie. Walked home, parted ways...  Now, I am home chewing on a straw.

      It was a relatively quiet Wednesday afternoon. Relatively quiet since my loud neighbours were home, and Wednesday since it was Wednesday. I was sitting in front of my desk doing some work, and leaned back in my not so comfortable chair. "Ahh, what a relatively quiet Wednesday afternoon," I thought and took a sip from my frothy cappuccino. Little did I know that within the next two seconds, my relative peace would be brutally shattered by the sound of cannons blasting in my immediate vicinity and angry sounding children running off aggressively to war.  It all started with a silent, seemingly harmless, fizz. I cocked my ears rather half-heartily, and quickly dismissed it, as it was just a fizz, and nothing unusual considering the weird things you can hear in this building. The sound didn't last too long, and just as I was getting comfortable again, it suddenly erupted into a loud bang that shook my windows, knocked my cappuccino off my desk, and made my retarded cat jump on my shoulders, nervously clawing at my jugular vein and scratching me bloody. "Holy shit!" I shouted while trying to pry the cat's claws out of my precious flesh. "We must be going to war!" I logically concluded, and jumped up whipping my hair around wildly for effect. I snuck a quick glance at my other cat, and saw her staring determined at the door. I could almost picture the miniature helmet on her head and tiny pistol at her waist.  I looked proudly at the little Belgian flag I carefully attached to the front door when I moved in, and saluted in a way that is difficult to describe, as I'm not a military woman, therefore don't really know how the Belgian army usually salutes. After collecting my weaponry, the trusty broom and long stick, I ran down the stairs, and when I arrived, the parking was abandoned. No sound could be heard, save for a small dripping noise and pretty much every single car alarm. Confused, I looked down and noticed remnants, not of a great and bloody battle, as I had anticipated with a perverse sense of joy, but of fireworks. I'm sure you wonder why someone had been stupidly lighting fireworks in broad daylight. Well, your guess is as good as mine. Mexicans never did make any sense to me.

      First of all, I am currently making this post with "lynx"- that's a text-based browser, people. This shit was obsolete by any reasonable person's standards in the early nineties. Unfortunately, due to whatever voodoo blogger do so well, it is the only browser I can use. Yeah. Teh sux.  Other than that, I'm feeling a bit alone in the world right now. That's how it goes, but it sucks anyway. I am also without any apprecciable funds, job, whatnot, facing an uncertain future at best. Okay, that's life. But it sucks anyway.    Sorry if this all seemed a bit bitchy. I'm in that sort of mood for the moment.

      "Can't wait! Oh my gosh, I can't beleive I forgot to tell you. How incredibly typical of me! I got baptized last week. It was really awesome. But the water was cold. Maybe I could send you some pictures of me getting baptized. Love you so much! Steph"  My niece is so cute! :D  Today wasn't a complete waste, even though I didn't make it to the conference. First, I went downtown with Suriyo. I got some cds. We went home and I met up with Emily 'cause we decided to go to Broadway. On the way there, we saw Shanelle and Eric at the bus stop. I haven't seen her in the longest time! Things are okay with her...and Curtis. She got her cell phone shut off. Her phone bill was a thousand bucks. AND I thought my bill was a lot! XD  Emily and I didn't do much at Broadway. We got some incense and had dinner at Torrero's. 8-) Them quesadillas hit the spot. We met some weirdo at the bus stop. He called me over and told me to look at his ID. He said to look at the DOB. I did and it said 08/08/1963 (how do I remember these things?) and yeah...he was trying to show me that his birthday's tommorow. I was like, "Hey, that's great." We got on the same bus and he sat next to me and Emily. He asked us if we were going clubbin'. I said we're too young. Then he was like, "Then you're too young for me..." He started talking to the girl he was sitting next to. He asked her how old she was and she said seventeen. He started laughing 'cause  she was not seventeen. More like twenty three. I felt bad for her. She was blushing and she did not want to talk to him. He came back to talking to us. He said, "You must be Filipino and Samoan. I can tell by your cheekbones." I told him I'm Thai and French. He did not understand so I got in his face and said "I'M WHITE AND ASIAN." He was like, "Woooo, hold on, girl!" :D I wasn't getting no attitude...he was too drunk to understand. Just making myself clear. He started saying some other shit and no one could understand him and I was kinda fucking with him. I was like, "What? Huh? Say what? Whatchu say?" I totally confused him even more. He got off the bus and I wished him a happy birthday. What a character! I think he's homeless, though. =| Will I ever see him again?! :( I'll remember him by his hair...and maybe that cup full of change he carried with him.   Ahh, I really like my new cds. Wish I had enough to get a few more. I've been wanting to get Daydream Nation and Surfer Rosa for the longest time.   Mission Of Burma-"Outlaw" Cool shit. 8-)

      I watched a Brazillian film called Madame Sata.  Protagonist: João Fransico He's is a man who likes men. He likes dressing up as women. He is poor. He lives in Lapa, Rio de Janeiro. He is an affectionate father to his 7 adopted children. He is a murderer. He is a cabaret star. He is...a homo.  Well, since the gay topic came up in a few of my conversations today, I would like to say...  They're here and they're queer and I love 'em. One love, y'all.   [/two cents]  I miss Robert. He was the coolest. Sometimes, I miss Joe too.

       If I Were Dictator of The World   Were this world under my fist, I would see to draw a list, And upon this list would I write What needed changing in my sight.  First I would change the state song, Perhaps to something not so long. Some Goa trance would be nice, Blow our minds once or trice.  Then Id make a brand new flag, Upon which thered be Englishmen in drag, And our national animal would change without fuss, To a dandy platypus.  My inaguration would be a rave, No-one shall be a black-tie slave, And well all dance into the night, Letting the sun point our respite.  Our national language, rather pronto, Would become Klingon or Esperanto. And our capital, oer more, Would be in tiny Singapore.  To solve the problems of commuters, Id make everyone to ride on scooters. And then we would have so much gas, The crisis would completely pass.  And to fix our troubled healthcare, Id make sure to send Chopra in there, And with ageless bodies and timeless minds, Wed all have the healthiest hinds.  And to better education, Id encourage facsination. With curiousity as schoolmaster, We all know theyll learn much faster.  As for the army, what Id do, Is arm them with some feathers and glue, And when our enemies are stuck to earth, Well tickle them till they repent to mirth.  So if these ideas make sense to you, If they seem indoubtedly true, And if youd like me to be head of state, Please vote in election twenty-oh-eight!

      Got my retainers today. Purdy neat. They're all plastic and clear, and you can't even tell if they're on or not at first glance.  Recumbent bicycles are neat. ^^

      Well, I finished Video 1 of Ken Burns's  The Civil War , last night. I'm going to start on Video 2 tonight. Only 8 more to go! It's been very interesting so far, and I've learned a lot. To those not interested in the War Between the States, no doubt this documentary would be painfully boring. The only time there's any movement is when they are talking to historians. Yup.  I dropped by Books-a-Million! today and picked up a nice copy of Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. After I finish that, I figure I'll take the plunge and start reading the New Testamnent of the Bible.  School starts back tomorrow. Auf Wiedersehen, my friends! *Weep*

       Gent:  Lately my musical tastes have been focusing on country and Irish folk. :-D  Gent:  And Chopin when I write(Except yesterday when I put Ride of the Valkries on a loop and wrote to it for about an hour.)  Theo:  Writing under the influence of Wagner could be dangerous  Theo:  "What we need here... Is a chase scene. Then a fight scene... Then the scene where they are all crushed... then a chase scene!!"

      I tried wintermelon boba today...  WEEEEIRD  Weirdest thing I've ever tasted in my entire life. It tasted like some sort of mix of tobbaco and kiwi... Yes,  that  odd.  My brother kept insisting that he buy me a cigar today... LOL... I politely declined. I have as many expensive detrimental habits as I can handle, merci.  Dinner's ready ^^

      Listening to:  The First Taste  by Fiona Apple  Today is good. I'm confident that GED thing will flee before my mighty powurz; mostly because I'm Loupette's clone. Muahahahah. Pheer da klonez. ^^

      my mom screamed at me.  reason: we have very different opinions as to my career moves.  she accepted it the other day. but she changed her mind. women sure are fickle.  but as much as i love her, i rather not spend my days in misery to humor her. i reckon i will outlive her afterall - by then, it doesnt matter any longer.

       Oh Please Keep Singing   I'm unhappy to hear that the sweet voice That I only just heard Doesn't want to keep singing Such silence would censure a soul like mine How do I be happy If something like that can vanish Slip into the void And never sing again?
