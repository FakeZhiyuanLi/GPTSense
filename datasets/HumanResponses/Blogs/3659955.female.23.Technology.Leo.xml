       urlLink    Anime drawing I worked on last night. I'm very new at drawing anime. If anyone has any advice for me, I would really appreciate it. This one was inspired by another drawing I saw on the internet and it is the anime version of me! &nbsp; urlLink

      I made it through my first week of intense training for work and I am now officially a computer nerd (if I wasn't already before.) I cannot believe how much information is swimming through my head... I'm so glad it's the weekend, though other than Father's Day and grocery shopping, I really have no plans. I need to get a life, I'm turning in to a boring married person! Help me! My best friend Melissa is home from Calgary soon, so then things will pick up a little, but still. I don't really know anyone here in Chilliwack. I need to make some friends and not sit around the house as much. I feel like everyone in the world has a really great social life except for me....

      Finally, after the tease of spring, summer is finally upon us, which is awesome, except I walked part of the way home from work and now I'm burnt and dizzy. Oh well, complain complain. I am doing a "trial run" on my day off to see how long it will take me to ride my bike to work, and how brave I feel doing so. :) Any words of encouragement for me? It will be good exercise, which I need since I sit in an office all day, and it will help seeing as my husband and only have one vehicle at the moment which he has to use for work. I have just got back into bike riding and am still feeling a little nervous about riding alongside traffic.
