						   I went to see Russian Opera today in the church next to Parkes Hall. Why you may ask, it was because my good friend,  Maxim  was singing in it. He said he had a vital part in it. So I went. Not understanding a word of Russian, I still enjoyed it enormously. Most of them time my mind was floating to something else, but it was definitely relaxing.  At intermission, I also met  Bea  and  Am . Surprise. I hadnt expected to see any thais there. I thought they were all uncultured haha . Turned out Am and Bea knew someone in the choir too. I wondered how many people were actually russian in the choir. It was already hard to sing like that and it was in Russian ; definitely didnt make life easier.   Another Russian i met said he didnt understand most of what they were singing . Either because their Russian were really bad or the opera made it harder to make out. Most of it sounded like Italian or German anyway. Come to think of it , All the continental languages sound the same. o!O   Maxim was a bass singer. I dont think he was very important either haha. But at least he s russian. All the other solo singers were all american.   After the chorus, i really wanted to liquidate my hi-fi. There s no way it can reproduce that kind of sound no matter how much i spend.:( (Maybe I really have to spend as much as a cinema). The sound was so heavenly.  I didnt understand one bit but the music was composed so beatifully. ( Tchaikovski and Bordin). Still I have to put Mozart as my NO. 1 composer . So far I have not heard any mediocre song from any of his operas.   The whole set up was just one pianist and some solo singers and the choir. I really enjoyed the chorus a lot. Lots of people really really make beautiful sound.   I m praying for  Beethoven No9  to be performed live soon. I wonder what it would sound like. It s got to be one of the best symphonies with chorus( not to mention the first). It s usually referred to as the choral symphony.

						   I just wanted to say something about this picture. Hope it is as entertaining and informative. Most people probably dont find anything striking about the picture. Not unless you have been to Britain. Edward s gesture of the two fingers are considered extremely rude and could get you in trouble. It probably means something like 'F*** off' or 'up yours' . No No especially in English pubs.. Well you might get away with being american:) (so there s a good tip for you, Bea)  First time I did it was in my maths class. My teacher was shocked as i waved the two fingers. I was trying to answer a question or something. So he spent almost the better part of the lesson explaing why. ( anything but teaching was his favourite subject).  According to him, during the 100 years war the French would cut off the two fingers from the English archers who were captured. After the English won, the whole army paraded around in France showing off the two fingers . ( Gentlemen then, Gentlemen Now)

						   Last week I had a severe food poisoning from eating Banquet frozen Spaghetti and meatballs. So on Friday, I called Banquet headquarter complaining about the food quality. They offered to give me free food from Banquet!! I obviously turned them down. I really wanted to sue them for 30K for my new home cinema project. Today they called back and asked what I wanted. I asked them what s fair. She said 20 dollars is our maximum compensation. After thinking long and hard , I said all right . :( EVIL corporation. They will also send 5 free coupons for free banquet food. ( more food poisioning perhaps) Anyway, I m blogging less frequently now that i did last week. I predict everything will come to a halt in about 1 week.

						   After the horrible day of rain , rain and more rain I went off to post my stuff I sold on ebay. Later we ended up at Northbrook mall since Lynn wanted to check the  LV store. It was rather boring then we got a call from  P keao  inviting us for Noodles and Pork Chop. Delicious .Unexpectedly  MAY  was also there.May and Lynn started to discuss about Victoria's secret catalogue and after I tried to make sense for 10 minutes, I politely asked them to change the subject. THEN!! it was all about Thaksin. The convo heated up so we moved to unicorn until 11 pm. I decided to apply for citizenship of Uganda if the situation worsens in Thailand. Canada is also a consideration, except for the bad accent and hockey, it might just be bearable. We might also be able to recruit Nan to join our discussion group about Thaksin. Anyone else? P.S. Thaksin is buying 30% stake of Liverpool. Lucky it wasnt ManU or I would seriously run naked at the Old Trafford. P.S2 BBC news on the topic  urlLink here

						   Lynn and I went to visit Warren Buffett last weekend since he wanted my investment ideas. pff All jokes aside, the annual meeting of  Berkshire Hathaway  started at 8 am, May 1st. We set off on Friday night. Stayed at Days inn about an hour away from Omaha. Then we woke up really really early 5.30 am then get breakfast along the way. It says in the schedule that there s a company movie. I had thought it would be something about how BRK started up 40 years ago. Was I in for a surprise. If you d thought it would be boring, you would have been so  wrong. The movie was BLOODY hilarious. The movie alone was worth the trip. Stars of the show:  Warren Buffett ,  Bill Gates ,  Arnie ,  Judge Judy  and the Saturday night Live crew. The movie contains many skits making fun of these guys and they play themselves. You wont be able to see it in any cinema. The meeting took place at Quest Center. It seats about 16,000 people. It was jam packed. After the movie,  Warren  and  Charlie Munger , his partner sat down for Q&A sessions lasting 6 hours. They are both very intelligent and have a good sense of humour. Listening to them was quite an eye (and ear) opening experience.   The whole time Lynn and I sat next to an older couple from Indiana. Undoubtedly they were millionaires. They were both very nice to us. The husband kept asking if i have any questions about  Warren Buffett . Think he was really eager to share his knowledge seeing that we got in on a $ 2.50 ticket. Normally it s reserved for shareholders but a share costs nearly $90K .!!!! (a whopping sum by any measures or currencies except  polish Zloties , sorry Poles) After the meeting ended, we learned that we could get to see Warren if we had brought our passports since he wanted to meet those who traveled a long way.   WHAT  A BUMMER .  In any case, the whole experience was really worth the trip.  I highly recommend it to any one who s a least bit interested in investing.    There s an M's Pub in the old market. I wonder if I should move to Omaha.   urlLink    M's Pub in Omaha, Nebraska

						   Yesterday a bunch of us turned up to see Pom getting older.  We went to this delightful Thai restaurant, Siam Pasta.  The food was delicious. We had the whole floor to ourselves.  Somehow we decided to order loads of appetizers instead of entrees.  We had a wonderful time. Incidentally Noi decided she wanted to be  British :)  The owner and waiters there were very nice. They also asked if  any of us want to work there. Recruiting at its finest.

						     Once again ,  England  managed to make the right mess of themselves. How did they manage to self-destruct in the last few minutes of the stoppage time.? It s beyond me.Normally it s the Argentines or the Germans or the bloody refs or penalty shootout. How come every promising team that they manage to come up with ends up horribly kicked out.     All is not lost though. With  Owen  back on form and  James  replaced, England shall rise again.  England  will just have to slaughter the  Swiss  and the  Croatians  which in my opinion should be a piece of cake if they dont screw up.  Well, we ll just have to beat the French in the final!!
