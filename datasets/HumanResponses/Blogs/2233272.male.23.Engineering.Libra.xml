       A shocking photo of Douglas "Doug" McConnell has appeared over the internet giving a frightening insight into the Stadium Rock Dreams of the Be-Spectacled Self-Proclaimed Soft Rock Saviour.  Rick Parfitt is said to be beside himself.

       As promised, here's a picture from the Oilers vs Flames game I was at last weekend.  Unfortunately, I was too busy cheering when the fights were going on to take photos of them but this one was taken just after the Oilers scored the winner in overtime.     It's bloody freezing here at the moment (-20 degC plus wind chill) so it's just as well the nearest off-licence is just across the road from the hotel!

       Sounds like Graham's dirty past is catching up with him and the Canadian government do not approve.  Oh well, see you on Thursday mate.  For webspace, this blog has been upgraded (free of charge) to a Blog*Spot Plus account, which provides us with 25Mb of space to fill.  There should be a new "Upload File" button on the "New Post" screen in Blogger.  Just ensure that pictures are:  1) Sensibly trimmed, i.e. no more than 500x400 pixels. 2) Compressed in a web-friendly format, .GIFs and .JPGs work best.  The picture of "Bob" below gives and idea of the maximum size that works well over a dial-up connection.  If in doubt, just post it and I'll trim it later via FTP.

       Just to update everyone - I'm not being allowed to leave Canada and have been placed under house arrest with armed guards at every door.  But with a bit of luck (not to mention my history of successful covert ops) I should manage to escape back to Aberdeen at some point on Thursday.  Oh and if someone could give me access to their web space I'll post my pictures from over here.  As it is I'm too lazy to arrange doing this myself.

Me, JB and Stu got fucking monged last night (2 for 1 drinks at the 'nage - don't order 9 drinks - THEY GIVE YOU 18!!!).  Anyway, I was drunk in work this morning.  John vomited in the shower and I dunno what happened to Mr King. Jesus, I feel like ass.

       I have just invited Graham, Cormac and John to join this blog in the hope that it might be fun.  Graham is in Canada just now, so I don't expect to hear from him until he gets back. Cormac is bored on the West Coast of Scotland, so he should have time to contribute some humor. As for John, this site should provide a much needed vent for his intense sexual frustration.

       Dear Friends, I just wanted to bring to your attention that I feel the year of the Cormac is coming to an end  and as such I feel it is appropriate I leave that name behind.  I was going to go with a symbol but all the good ones had gone so....Cormac - has gone.  Long Live "DISCOBOY"!!!

       Hi Everyone, Just a quick note to say that, JB,  I am sorry to say that neither of your supposed googlewhacks are correct.  For a two words to be a googlewhack, they both have to be in the dictionary.  Since neither 'sizemic' or 'retract.......cation' (or whatever that first one was) appear of dictionary.com, neither of your pairs are googlewhacks.  A helpful tip, is that is you type in your pair on google.com, once the search is complete, the words will be underlined if they appear in the dictionary (in the blue bar).  Also if the possible googlewhack webpage is a dictionary or word list of some sort, then they are disqualified.    Try harder next time.  Anyway,if you want some examples of real googlewhacks: try 'hippocampi wallpaper' or 'bibliophilic sandwiched'.  I am still unemployed incase any of you wondered.

       I was hoping to have time to create some sort of animation/picture to celebrate Guy's homecoming; the return from the land of "gangstas" and "thugz".  Unfortunately, I'm running out of time (got proper work to do) and my imagination is in a rut.  I got as far as this:     I may get round to making it move at some point, but for now I've decided to use it to launch a caption competition.  What do you think Guy is thinking or saying in the picture? Can you think of any good slogans that could accompany this picture as a poster campaign?  Post suggestions as comments, best entry wins a beer. For the artistic amongst you, you can obtain a bigger version of the file  urlLink here  for editing.

         Hello, I'm Batman.  When I was just a child, my parents were murdered right in front of my eyes.  I made a solemn vow that day to commit my life to fighting crime.  I've sacrificed my childhood and any efforts toward personal enjoyment.  My nights are spent in deadly combat with everything from common street thugs to grotesque psychopaths.  What little sleep I ever get is usually interupted by horrible nightmares of brutal murder and my waking up soaked in sweat.  I fight a war that can never be won.  I strive toward a goal that can never be reached.  I am haunted.  I am relentless.  I am tortured.  Won't you be my valentine?

       Following Tuesday's fiasco that was my guitar playing, John and I have decided to put in a bit more effort for next week.  Not only will I be writing the chord sequences in BIGGER WRITING so I can read them, I may actually practice the songs in advance.  I think the "3 song" approach will work best; 2 of John's own and a cover song.  But frankly we're too lazy to pick a song to cover ourselves, instead we are giving you (yes, you) the opportunity to pick "A Song for Muzz and Mozz".  Suggestions should be posted as comments. The winner will be picked by JB and myself unless there is an overwhelming majority for a particular song.  Good luck, and get voting!

       Hello everyone, I'm back from my short break in sunny Manchester!  I can confirm that I did in fact go on every major ride at Alton Towers and I have pictures to prove it!  Although, after 10 years of torment, I have to say that the Nemesis was a bit disappointing. Air is good, but Oblivion was the best.  Managed to get sun-burnt again.  Leeds seemed to be a bit of a sh*t-hole, one big building site.  Here is a picture of me and Debbie with our new friends:

       ....and there were shouts of joy.   I'm off, thought this photo was appropriate.  Let me know how you all are, like I say I dunno how easy it is going to be for me to stay in touch, but I'll do my best.  I'll miss you all very much.  Look after yourselves and I'll see you sometime soon.  Meanwhile feel free to view my minimal progress on the  urlLink blog  and the " urlLink Voyage of the Odyssey " webpage.  This is The Booth, signing off.

       Hello boys and girls,  I am now slightly unbeleivably in Tanzania. When I went on holiday with my family a few weeks ago I had a rough idea that I would stay if i could find anything worthwhile to do, but i sincerely didnt think I'd find it, but i kind of did albeit in a terribly unpaid fashion. Nevertheless the job is cool, and the people/landscape/food is brilliant.  So there we go, I stayed they went. If all goes well I'll be back in Spetember so its not a proper good bye a la Cormac. Feel sorry for not updating you all on things before I went and milking the departure for at least a piss up but I didnt really know i'd stay. In fact Revolution had me shifted on for work all this and last week. Whoops. :P  Anyway hope you are all doing well I'll start sending out some proper emails the next time I have a large task to do at work. In case you dont know my email is johnprimrose (at) hotmail.com and as scott or cormac could tell you I'm always on MSN.  Take it easy  John  Look at this if you havent already  urlLink www.rockpapersaddam.com

        urlLink    Click to big it.  Mairi,  urlLink here  is one of the piccies taken with my new phone for you to get an idea of it's capabilities. I think you'll agree, despite the good picture quality, Graham still looks like a smug git.
