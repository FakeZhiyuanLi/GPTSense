      Just right quick... I changed the name of my site.  The games and fun will still be the same.  I just felt like I crippled myself in my ability to write by letting certain people know the address.  All names will still be changed to protect the guilty, the stories may get a bit more outrageous, and there may even be more drama to come!  So let the games begin.  Thanks!

      Just a quick bit here... I'm flipping thru the newest issue of People Magazine (which I hardly ever read, but it caught me at the check out) and I see this picture...  It's a photo of David Bowie. He's wearing a green tshirt, sporting what appears to be a handlebar mustache, & cowboy hat. I've also noticed that A) He has little man boobs and B) He has T.H.O's (must I type it?)  Behind him, is a man of obvious Oriental descent, who by the way, looks like this Korean guy I lived with in college.  His name was Bianco, he ate  Kimchee ALL the time, which meant our house always smelled like rotting trash & farts. (*mental note to self: Write blog on those horrid few months)  The uncanny thing about this photo, is at first glance, I thought it was Mr. Detroit himself Ted Nugent. How in the WORLD could I have mistaken Ziggy Stardust for Ted Nugent? Whoa. I guess when you become an old , burnout, crusty rockstar, it's all the same.

      I just returned from a trip into town (which is a whole 4  miles up the road). On my way to the grocery, I decided I'd pull into one of the many subdivisions along the way and try to find one of my  girl's new digs.  She recently bought a house a mile up the road.  Unfortunately for me, it was 10p.m , there were no street lights, and this neighborhood only has one entrance.  I felt like I was in a trap.   After driving around endlessly looking for one red Honda( since I didn't catch her address or street), I gave up my plight & started searching for the entrance/exit to this Labrynth.  When I could not find my way out, I didn't panic, I started craving a smoke.  Luckily for me, I started diggin in my purse.  In my dark car, in a dark neighborhood, which is under construction with no street lights.   (Do you see where this is leading yet?) I pull onto a street, which I think will lead me to the way out.  I instead, cut my wheel to quick, hop a curb and drive over this guys front yard.  Nice right?  It gets better.  There are, to my advantage, 8 police cars 2 doors up.  There are also 4 cops standing around, doing nothing I'd imagine,  and they all witness me do a horrible injustice to a new home owner by driving on his newly planted Bermuda grass.  Cue in sirens, lights and whistles OH MY!  I pulled over anyway. First, because I figured they thought I was drunk.  (I'm not) Secondly, I had been driving aimlessly in this damn neighborhood for about 20 minutes trying to get out.  I was hopeful my local authorities could escort me to the main gate. Third, I needed a piece of gum.  Alas! Let's not forget I live in a small town. This means that I'm walking away scott free.   As the officer approaches my car, I think to myself "Eh, should I say: No sir, ossifer, I hadn't drank a drink all day! Hic" but I realized that was none too smart. He did approach, and as he got closer, I recognized him from the local gas station. Whew! He said: Trixie! What in God's name are you doin' drivin' round here like a maniac?! Yew been a drinkin'? "Aww, hell man.  Yew know I ain't a big drinker.  Plus, I used my last bit of 'Shine to fuel my car!" Hahahaha. I explained to him the err of my ways and why I ran over that guys grass.  How I was still diggin' for a piece of gum and still wanting to smoke. He offered me a stick of gum and the directions to get the hell out of the neighborhood. (Stop sign T/L. Next sign T/R. Go 1/2 mile, entrance straight ahead!)  Whew. For a moment there I thought I was going to turn into David Bowie.

      Right now all I want is a giant Almond Joy milkshake from Brewster's Ice Cream. I want one so bad I can taste it.  I mean I REALLY want one & bad! Instead of eating crap to surpress my craving, I will probably do about 75 sit ups , some push ups &amp; jump up and down on my bed.  ( hey, it's better than jumping up and down on the floor!)  It's 815pm, I'm just getting home from Valucinda's house.  I went over there after work and fell asleep. Sigh. That's ok, RD is still @ my Pop's house working in his shop.  He should be home shortly and then we'll be taking off to Nashville for a little R&R.  Hopefully.  If he doesn't fall asleep first...  Since I slept 2 hrs after work I'm sure I'll be blogging yall to death around 12-1am today.  :) Get ready! OH! And I've been 5 days without a smoke! Can I getta Hell yes?!  Well, I'm going to go get ready for a night of being fancy free with my man. Tomorrow I am going up to the jail with my step mom to visit my brother.  I'll have to get up fairly early (so maybe I shouldn't spend all night rambling?)  Till then! I leave you still craving that Almond Joy milkshake... mmmm.... milkshake.... yuuummmmmy.

      Ok, I have a question to throw out there.  Maybe I'm being left out of the loop, maybe I was raised differently, or maybe I'm a bit morbid.  My husbands Granny is pretty ill. She's only going to be around for a few more weeks.  Granted, I do think about this here and there throughout the day.  That the woman who is such a staple in my husband's family will be leaving shortly.  I know he'll miss her, she practically raised him.  Last night, while having supper @ the in-laws,  my M-I-L asks me to come to the back room so she can show me  her new clothes! cool!   ( right... ) so anyway, I get to the back room and she says: "Well, I picked this little number out to go to Jim's 45 year High School Reunion.  He likes it better without the jacket. But my arms are too fat to wear with out it. . . " So forth and so on. I also saw the shoes to match , jewlery, etc etc.  As I began to make my way out of the room she said: "But I really love this one the most." I turn around to see her holding a black dress with these wierd white stripes on the sides. Hmmm. What's that for? " I picked this one out for Granny's funeral.  (!) I got it on sale for 10.00$, I think it will suffice.  It's not like we're going to a  dinner party or anything. Oh, and look at these sandals I got to go with it. " I became very perplexed.  She already picked out an outfit to wear to someone's funeral who isn't dead yet? And she's wearing sandals with a knee length dress? It's also safe to assume she will be wearing black hose with this outfit too.  On top of her outfit, my father in law comes back there with my husband. He shows us the new suit he bought for the occasion. BUT!  Not only is his suit for Granny's funeral it's also for his OWN funeral, whenver that may be. He was quite proud of himself for killing two birds with one stone (no pun intended there). He was quite proud of his thrifty-ness; being that the suit only set him back $200.00.  I was in total disbelief. On the way home I was thinking to myself: Should I be buying an outfit for the funeral? Isn't that a bit over the edge? I've never done anything like that before.  EVER.  Is it inproper to wear clothes you already own to a funeral? I own a lot of black, I think I'll be ok.  But what if.. oh gosh... what if my mother in law buys me a dress to wear? Oh man... Maybe it's a Southern thing I was unaware of? Hmm. I asked my husband what he thought about it while we were laying in bed. He replied: "Well, I was going to ask you to go with me Friday afternoon to go pick out a suit too. "  Oh good gosh A'mighty.

      This morning I realized that I'm a klutz. A big one.  Yesturday, as you all know, I fell while standing up at the fax machine.  Yeah, I didn't think it was possible, but yknow, I defy the laws.  This morning, I fell out of my bed.  Mmm hmm. Like I was 5 again, blooooop, right out of the bed.  I hit my head on my end table on the way down. After I blessed myself out, I crawled back into the bed, and accidentally laid on top of our cat Abby.  She'll probably hate me now.  I also tripped going into my bathroom, stubbed my toe on the molding , knocked over the toothbrush holder, almost brushed my teeth with hair gel oh, and I fell in the shower and hit my head on the tile. Well, no harm done.  I DID scrub that tile within an inch of it's true color, so I know it's clean.  I'm not too sure what's happening to me.  I've always been a klutz though.  It just comes in waves.  Once, while in downtown Nashville attending a rock concert, I fell in the middle of a crosswalk. No, I wasn't drunk. I was walking with a group of friends, hurridly making my way across the walk in front of Saturday night traffic and fell.   Flat on my face. I  barely made it up in time before the light turned green and I was run over. I did however, recieve applause from passengers in cars, honks and shouts of "Hey DRUNK! get your ASS off the road!! "  Sigh.  Such is life. Maybe tomorrow I'll be accident free?

      Well well well... What do I have here? Enough gossip to fill this website for at least a few months .   In an office full of women, it's expected.  Things get catty, childish, stupid, and then all out violent.  I've seen it happen.  I've seen my coworkers go from meek & mild to full on REDNECK in a matter of minutes.  I've had to drag my coworkers from bar brawls and keep them from beating their husbands senseless.   I've maintained the peace, smoothed the wrinkles and always nodded in agreement.   Then, for quite awhile, it all stopped. There was no nonsense, no violent bursts of "Let's take it outside Heffa'" , everyone was on the same page and things were right as rain. But folks, I feel a storm a brewin'. A big ole giant storm.  The kind where the weatherman inturrupts your favorite Reality Show for the next 3 hrs letting you know that some city like Buck Snort, will be hit @ approximatly 7:03 p.m. It's gonna be that fierce.  I've felt it coming on for awhile.  I haven't said to much about it.  All things must run thier natural course.  For whatever it's worth, I'm not revealing the gossip as of yet. Awwwww I know!!! The horror! How dare I dangle a juicy piece like that and then jerk it away. Be patient.  All good things &amp; ideas come to those who wait.

      This morning when I woke up I decided two things.  1. I could / would make it through my day without the patch and  2. I was going to wear a plaid skirt.   I made it till about 930am and came very close to getting midevil on someones ass.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had chewed 4 pieces of Nicorette Gum & 2 packs of Trident.&nbsp; I was now realizing that I'm an addict.&nbsp; Shit.   However,  Aside from wanting to bitch slap someone, I did look mighty cute in my skirt.  That is, until I met up with the Fax Machine this afternoon.   I'm not too sure if my clumsy-ness is more acute now that I'm not smoking or what.&nbsp; I don't know but something is off kilter with me.&nbsp;  I approach the fax like a fawn approaching a cool drink. Papers in hand, I extend my reach to place the papers down and... OH NO MR. BILL!  Trixie St. Eclair bites the dust! Oh, those rug burns are gonna hurt!  YEouch "But Tim, look at her beautiful fall. Her physique is amazing..."   &nbsp; Yes folks, I fell.  Not on the way to the machine, but while I was STANDING at it.  Yep. It's possible to fall while standing up.&nbsp; I prooved that theory today.  The whole incident would have been a minor double take in office etiquette.. yknow the "oh shit.. did someone see me?"  They did.   And I laid there on the floor of my office with rug burns, laughing my ass off, because&nbsp; I just fell, in front of 7 people with a plaid skirt on.   Damn what a Thursday

      Let me brief this story by restating the facts:  A) I am now a non smoker  B) This means I'm a bitch  C) I am also PMSing D) That means I'm a bigger&nbsp;bitch E) I sleep 3 hrs a night F) That is my fault &  G) This means I'm a Total&nbsp;&nbsp;bitch.   Ok. Now that that is cleared up, I will begin.  Yesturday afternoon rolls around.&nbsp; I leave work late.&nbsp; I get home late.  My husband is still snoozing, peacefully, in our room.&nbsp; It's almost 6pm.&nbsp; My room has windows with a beautiful view of my favorite weeping Cherry tree.&nbsp; I never see it.&nbsp; My husband has nailed astro Turf to our windows b/c sunlight affects his sleep during the day.   I cooked dinner. Yes!  (go ahead and clap Mom)  I made BBQ Chops w/ corn, salad, fresh cut Tomatoes, etc etc.  My husband said I had the grill on to high.&nbsp; I bit my tongue.  As I'm bringing the Cream'd Corn to the table I drop the bowl, it shatters and corn goes flying ALL over our kitchen & &nbsp;giving my right leg and foot a nice burn.&nbsp; Normally, I would have laughed, as a PMSing, nonsmoking, less sleep than normal Woman, I went freakin' Mad.   Lets fast forward to later on that evening.  My husband had cleaned up the corn , never saying if he like the Chops, I had already walked out of the house for a 2 mile jog, came back and he's cleaning the house.   He "suggests" I clean the bathroom.  Don't go there with me .  It was HIS turn.&nbsp; If any of you guys reading this think women don't keep a mental check list of when it's your turn to wipe YOUR piss off the toilet, YOUR'E WRONG!  So anyway,  I digress.&nbsp; It was his turn.&nbsp;  I ended up doing it.   As I'm knee deep in dirty&nbsp;&nbsp;Lysol infected water,&nbsp;scrubbing his black hand&nbsp;& foot prints off the tile, &nbsp;my husband brings a fan into the bathroom.&nbsp; I glance up and mutter to myself to put Tilex on the grocery list.  "What for? You just need to put more elbow greese into your work."   Folks, if I wasn't in a tub full of water I would have jumped out and bitch slapped him. Hard. And made sure my wedding ring left a mark on his face.  Last I checked I was his wife NOT the hired help.   I left shortly after cleaning the tub and took a country drive.  I've also made a list of rules for the bathroom.  I've also thought about smoking today, I can only chew so many pieces of Nicorette gum.  Damn our bathroom and all that White Tile.

      I have acquired myself a nickname (believe it or not!) Me, the giver of all nicknames has recieved one in return.&nbsp;   I'm known now as .... Ruby J.  And I can't even type it without bursting into a fit of laughter.   See, this is how it all started. Everyone knows that I quit smoking on what, Monday? So let's factor that in.  Secondly, we all know I got mangled by the dentist a few weeks ago.&nbsp; My perfect record of having flawless teeth was shattered.&nbsp; I'm having to get a crown....  Not a big deal right?   WRONG.   I got a statement from our lovely insurance provider, MetLife.  Those bastards covered every other procedure I've had done, BUT they WILL NOT pay for a porcelien or veneer fitting for a tooth.&nbsp; ONLY GOLD.   GOLD?  Are you&nbsp; kidding me?? This is a tooth that can be SEEN when I smile.  So, as I'm holding the statement in my hand, livid,&nbsp; cursing the day MetLife was created and crying... my husband says to me: Oh c'mon honey, it's not that big of a deal.  uh huh.  Right.  Let me see YOU get a gold tooth where folks can see it when you smile.   Not that gold is bad. If it's in the very back of your jaw or oh, I dunno, your involved w/ gangsta rap.&nbsp; I mean, whoever did Flava Flave's teeth, please, do mine, because they look great!   The whole time I'm staring at this statement the only thing that pops into my head is this:  Oh my gosh. I'm gonna have to get a gold tooth.&nbsp; I'll be paranoid about it for the rest of my days. With my luck, I'll go to Nashville one night with friends, get mugged by a bum who will then proceed to rip my gold tooth out, melt it down, make it into Golden Nuggets & get rich @ the flea market.   I mention all of this to my girlfriend @ work the other day.&nbsp;  She breaks into hysterics & starts ripping on me. I walk off and in a whiny 5 year old tone say to our boss:  WAAAAA.... Carie is picking on me again.&nbsp; She's making fun of me having to get a gold tooth!!   By the time I told her, it had made it's way around the office.&nbsp; As a few of us were gathered around the fax machine, we burst into laughter.&nbsp; All of us.&nbsp; And it only continued.  Carie said:  Well Trixie, you could always get that gold tooth and to top it off in your style, get a Ruby J put on the outside.&nbsp;(*My real name starts with J)&nbsp;  &nbsp;As soon as she said it I got a phone call and answered :  "Good Afternoon, This is Ruby J, how may I help you?"  And That's That with THAT folks!

      Goodwill has officially opened a MEGA huge store not even 5 miles from my job.  Now all my thrift store needs will be satisfied.  No more driving to East Nashville to find that one cool, worn out Tshirt with the odd saying (Like Peace Love & Honda or BangBusters!) No more long trips to the ghetto to find that one spectacular item (Rhinestone shoes, a feux minx coat or jewlery). I'm so exicted.&nbsp; No more trips to those "trendy" thrift shops made for teenagers and girls who wear a size 0-4.  I'm free from it! For Goodwill has a Mega store!  And... I saw someone I knew when I walked in!! :)  This giant girl (not giant as in overwieght, but giant TALL) I knew from back in the day.&nbsp; She's still giant.&nbsp; And cut off all her hair.&nbsp; This chick used to have the most beautiful black flowing locks down to her ass.&nbsp; She chopped 'em all off to her chin! It looks nice.&nbsp;  She's doing well.&nbsp; Still overdoing it on the drag makeup though.&nbsp; Regaurdless, I was glad to see a familiar face.   I'll also be writing about The Voodoo Man &amp; The Caver later on..  I must get my thoughts in line!

      Outside my old&nbsp;dingy  Apartment, There was a grey Payphone.   I spent many  early mornings on that phone.   My left foot was&nbsp; always propped  up on the door.  So that the homeless guy wouldn't bug  me for more Soju.   I spent  hundreds in  that booth.  Drunk off Soju Screaming in  The dirty reciever :  ITS ALL YOUR FAULT!  But it wasn't.  Nothing was your  Fault.   I would stumble out. Reaching for Sanji as I cried.   He would comfort me In his broken Japanese.  And point to the  Phonebooth and  say: Yoh Confession?  &nbsp;

      Instances with you  I enjoyed.  They&nbsp;were few  and  Far between.   The last we saw  one another I looked like  Sylvia Plath  at Oxford.  Glasses on.  Nails painted red. Books piled high  Next to me.  With notes  scattered like  bits of snow.  You approached. I smiled a long, thick welcoming smile.  Our time I miss.  Your voice sounds  different.  Much more hollow,  Like I'm yelling  into a barrell.   You say my nails are violent looking.  That you dig my  black rimmed glasses. You're curious  as to what my  scattered notes say.   I cannot show you.  For our instances  together  are more far  than between.

      There is this quiet spell, That haunts my inner self.   If you look at me closely  you will see it  happening.   Watch me next time. Pencils that swirl around my curls,  The way I bite my lower lip,  My quiet hello when  I'm expecting you.  My quiet spell  is who I truly  am.   No one yet  knows.  That when I fall silent, when I fall  behind,  when I fall...  I fall  and  fall  and  fall.  All due to  the quiet spell  that haunts  me.

      Ok...  I am wide awake.&nbsp; Due to the Dayquil/Sinutab I popped about 6pm (on top of 3 cups of coffee).   And what is this I see on VH1?  Swingers?&nbsp; They're showing it! It's almost like Skinimax. Get the hell outta here!&nbsp; There's a play by play! How can you get off with another couple while someone from a major cable network is hovering over you with cameras?   Bizarre. Absolutley Bizarre.  I'm not into the "lifestyle"&nbsp;.  I do however, know people who are.&nbsp; I will of course, for their sake, keep their names out of this blog. Not even a nickname.&nbsp;  Initially, when I first met these people, I thought they were just Free.&nbsp; I say Free as in, hippie Free.&nbsp; As in, "Yeah, you see that garden? It's not an Herb garden" its a H.E.R.B garden."&nbsp; Free as in She doesn't wear a bra, he doesn't&nbsp;believe in politics. Free as in they make their own clothes and love Mother Earth.&nbsp; &nbsp; Blame it on my Pisces nature, my naivity, whatever.&nbsp; I truly just , well, I was clueless.  That is, until they hit on me.&nbsp;  And THEN&nbsp;I was&nbsp;stuck there, on a couch between Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,&nbsp;in a&nbsp;sheer panic.&nbsp; They do not prepare you for these moments in&nbsp;school. &nbsp;&nbsp; Your parents can't really explain it to you, unless of course they&nbsp;too are into the "lifestyle."&nbsp; Nothing I had ever expierenced in my entire life ever prepared me for being&nbsp;mauled by two people I&nbsp;knew.  As I sit here, I'm soaking in this Pop Documentary.  It's different, it's interesting, its.... Sex, fluffed up for VH1.   &nbsp;

      I have been officially smoke free for a day and a half.  (Thank you! Thank you! As I bow to the applause, hands clasped in victory!)  But I still have an eternity to go.  I only craved one horribly today and that was about 1:30pm. I made it home just fine, made it thru supper without a twitch and as Im contimplating painting on my giant canvas, I realize I'm not ready.&nbsp; I can't paint right now and NOT smoke.&nbsp; Smoking and painting goes hand in hand with me.&nbsp; Like cream in your coffee, I have to have a smoke burning in the ashtray while I'm painting.   The big task will be tomorrow.  Although I made it thru this day without any major catastrophies, I think that only happened because I'm wearing the mega watt patch.  I'm out of those as of the A.M.  I will have to step down to the equivilant of a 60 watt lightbulb.&nbsp; Not a good thing when you're used to florescent lights.

      I sometimes wonder, when an amazing moment happens in my life, if I am really "IN" the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this really occurring or is it 40 years from now & I'm rehashing it to my grandkids.&nbsp; Am I reliving these moments in time in my own mind?&nbsp; Are they really happening?&nbsp; Did my child just sign his name?&nbsp; Did he really just speak to me in Spanish?&nbsp; Amzaing.&nbsp; It truly is.&nbsp; His mind is like a sponge.&nbsp; Although he still hasn't gotten the hang of Shutes & Ladders, I still love his little quirks. How he can't drink his milk without twirling&nbsp;my hair.&nbsp; Or how he says to me: "Mommy, I love you more than bread!"&nbsp; His re-emerging Southern accent, just a little here and there.&nbsp; Like when he says:&nbsp;C'meeeere Momma. C'meeeere an' see my motor&nbsp;sick-le. Yes. He does talk that way.&nbsp; I can't correct it. It's just too cute.&nbsp; Well, I think&nbsp;I'm going to head on out.&nbsp; I&nbsp;owe&nbsp;my Little Monkey some TBall time.&nbsp; It's my turn to be the pitcher. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Before I went to lunch, I had already decided that I wanted a sandwich from this quaint little deli off the square.  I didn't even get close.  First off traffic was SO bad that I found myself white knuckling my steering wheel.&nbsp; The area where I normally park? It doesn't exist anymore.&nbsp; That's right folks, it vanished! Overnight.  In it's place were giant cranes, bulldozers, construction workers, dumptrucks and mounds of dirt.&nbsp; Damn the expansion of the Judicial Center!!  So I decided to go to another Deli down the street.&nbsp; As I approach the light, what's this I see? NO LEFT TURN??!!! What?! When did that shit happen? Probably overnight again.&nbsp; On any other given day I would have turned left, but there was a sherriff behind me.&nbsp; I must abide by the law! I head on straight, around the square, back to the same light opposite direction, turn right and what? No spots anywhere. None! Not even a little itty bitty illegal spot! Damn it to hell!  I went to Cap'N D's.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll be sick as a dog come 5pm.&nbsp; I was starving and it was the nearest location.  I think I'll write a letter to the editor.&nbsp;  Ahem.   Dear Editor,  I am pissed.&nbsp; Please explain the city's actions against closing off two city streets for months, in front of my favorite deli.&nbsp; Please explain in writing, why the Judicial Center is larger than the tallest building in our small town and why those who are most priviledged to work there will get the best parking.  Please explain, in writing why there is NO left turn on 4th Ave and NO right turn onto 4th Ave. This is assinine.&nbsp; Just install a turn signal. Problem solved.  I expect to see your reply within the next week in my mailbox.&nbsp; If not, I will begin a protest on the steps of the courthouse.&nbsp; In the nude, with my friends that say: YOU SUCK! Why should the Judge get a brand new building when you can't even install ONE turning signal. I hope you enjoy "walking" to eat your lunch everyday.&nbsp; For the rest of us Blue Collar Americans we must either drive or pack leftovers.

      Earlier today I was talking to the Voodoo Man.  We had a couple of good laughs at the expense of his nickname and the secrecy it holds.  You see, there is another Agent within our company who is curious as to the Voodoo's identity.  I cannot tell him, I swore to myself that when I started this blog, I would not reveal names of those that I nicknamed.   Plus, it makes the game all the more fun! Right? Right.  I'm trying to come up with a covert name for this agent.&nbsp; I have a few picked out:  PhillyPhat, Bones, The Caver... but I'm not too sure which one fits as of now.&nbsp;  So lets just use .... hmmm.... The Caver.&nbsp; Yeah, that will work for now.&nbsp; For this blip anyway.   See, The Caver started a new gig.&nbsp; He went "movin' on up to da North Side."&nbsp; Which is cool.&nbsp;Although we miss him&nbsp;in our region here. ALOT. &nbsp;It just so happens that The Voodoo Man is within close proximity to The Caver.  I think it's bothering him that he cannot figure out the identiy of Voodoo.&nbsp; Awww.&nbsp;  But c'mon Caver! It's sooo much fun trying to figure out who it is!   Yesturday Voodoo called me and we talked briefly.&nbsp; Then somehow, The Caver came into conversation.&nbsp;  Voodoo was very impressed with The Caver.&nbsp; Said he was a cool guy, etc etc. Just small talk for&nbsp;they only met briefly.   Last night while online, I bumped into The Caver.  He wants to know who my "spies" are. Haha! &nbsp; Tsk Tsk.&nbsp; Don't you know Caver? It's not WHAT you know but WHO you know! And by that I now know that you have your own office upstairs! An office! And upstairs none the less!!&nbsp;Are you close to Joe? Give him high five from the gang&nbsp;when you see him! :)&nbsp; I am so jealous!&nbsp;Here I sit,&nbsp;in the Cube Farm dreaming of my own office, brass plate on the front with " Trixie St. Eclair" in bold etching, my own pens, own printer, a window that maybe looks over a parking lot.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; Such are Corp. Dreams.   Alas,  I will say this.&nbsp; That the Voodoo Man & The Caver are very close confidants of mine.&nbsp; Their secrecy I will keep in the shadows.&nbsp; I promise, I'm leak proof.

      I survived last night.  I didn't smoke after 6pm, which by the way was the hardest thing ever.&nbsp; I was in total bitch mode.&nbsp; But I survived.&nbsp; I just took a quit jog around the block and came back, played with M, & read him Bears on Wheels!! My car only needed a new battery.&nbsp; Thankfully!! RD and his buddy Jamie hooked it up for me.&nbsp; Those two! So sweet.&nbsp; Now my little Sentra purrs like a kitten!   I'm still suffering from the plague.&nbsp; I feel worse today then I did yesturday.&nbsp; I'm about to eat some Dayquil since my eyes are watering & I can't really breathe.  In my buisness, if you breathe thru you mouth on the phone, you come off sounding like a perverted prank caller.  I don't need that harrassment today!   Oh and FYI:  Two people I went to school with now live in my neighborhood.&nbsp; As I was driving to Wendy's last night I passed them, they waved, I stopped, we chatted. :)  Apprarently they are married.&nbsp; I never even knew they knew one another in school.  Small town maddness right here!   Till lunch,  I leave you sickly and tired. Trixie

      Ok, so I said I'd quit smoking this afternoon.  I lied.  Big time.  I still don't have a pack in my possession, but I bummed one off the guy who works @ the gas station by my house. (Remember, I know these people, so it's not like it's laced with LSD or anything!)  On my way out of work I noticed my car was acting funny.&nbsp; I get behind some grandma doing oh, 33 mph in a 55mph zone, I've got some bitch in a Yukon honking her horn at me to pass (yeah, ok... it's double yellow line during rush hour. Are you ignorant?) and I just discovered I left my favorite Cure CD in Atlanta. Bummer right?  Hold your horses, here comes the kicker folks.   I pull up to M's school and for a  split second  I think about leaving my car running.&nbsp; I should have LISTENED to that itty bitty voice in my head.&nbsp; "Just leave it runnin' Trixie."&nbsp; Oh no.&nbsp; I turn it off.&nbsp; So, as M is showing me all his papers from school, telling me how to sign his name (YES!! He learned sign language today! Is that not awesome?!) I get in the car and...  Nothing.&nbsp;  It doesn't start.&nbsp; I almost threw a M&M fit (as we in the family call them.&nbsp; Named heroically after my father) I counted to 5 and said: M, our freakin' car is broke down.&nbsp; This sucks huh??&nbsp;  I go inside to use the phone.&nbsp; Where I am politely greeted by my son's new best friend Grant and his "I used to be a stripper but now I married money" mother.&nbsp; Terriffic.&nbsp; What comes out of my sons mouth?  "Hey Grant! Our freakin' car is broke. Sucks huh?"&nbsp; Oh my gosh! I'd thought I'd die!   So Mrs. Stripper Money asks how is it broken?  (I swear) Ugh, gee Mrs Smart Ass , if I knew that I wouldn't be on the friggin' phone trying to WAKE UP my husband.&nbsp; Who, by the way, had turned off the phone AND the machine.&nbsp; Brilliant.&nbsp; Freaking BRILLIANT.  I call my Dad's house.&nbsp;  He's at work, but! Ta DA!  My gay stepbrother, who just pulled in the driveway from some country music video hair shoot, will be more than glad to come to my rescue.&nbsp; Faaaabulous!   When Joe arrives I am not just blinded by his pink hair (which actually matched my toenails) but by the fact that niether one of us knows where the jumper cables go!! Damn! I knew I should have paid attention in shop. You'd think that someone at the school would have 'em. Yknow, a hot soccer Dad, the single mom blasting RKelley, that Truck driver guy...  They didn't, I asked.   I finally got my car jumped.&nbsp; And then proceeded to ask Joe for a smoke.  By time I got home I was so livid I'd thought I'd lose it.   My husband is currently at AutoZone with his best friend, while I pray I just need a new battery. Not a new alternater.&nbsp;  And this whole time I can hear only these words from my father:  YOU SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT AN AMERICAN CAR TRIXIE!!!

      Get ready friends.  Tomorrow I quit smoking.&nbsp;  Eh, I know, it's like pushing a rope up a hill.&nbsp;  I honestly do not know how I will function without them.&nbsp; Not that I smoke excessively.&nbsp; I'm a half a packer, a social smoker.&nbsp;  I can't paint without smoking.&nbsp; I can't write without smoking.&nbsp; This is like an expierement for me. My pack of cigarettes are my dependents.&nbsp; I carry them&nbsp;with me.&nbsp; I feel like they protect me. &nbsp; I wish I went with my Dad to Canada, he got zapped.&nbsp;  That's right. Z-A-P-P-E-D.&nbsp; This whole procedure is illegal in the States.&nbsp; But our brethren to the North have made it legal.&nbsp; My Dad smoked 4 packs a day, got zapped,&nbsp; and he's smoke free for $300 bucks.   I've already started to panic.&nbsp; I've got one for the road.&nbsp; I'll go home tonite, put the patch on, and when I fall asleep I'll have the most vivid dreams.  If anyone out there has smoked and been on the patch, feel free to share your dreams.&nbsp; They're amazing aren't they?   I started thinking about joining a support group.&nbsp; SA. Smokers Anon.&nbsp; Do they have meetings? A 12 step program? Do you get coins for each month smoke free?&nbsp; I'm scared.  I know I know... You're better off not smoking. Cancer, your clothes stink, it's outrageously expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't like smoking, but I'm addicted.  Maybe I'll have a funeral for my lighters tonite. There's an idea.   I can also see the fights unfolding between my husband and I.&nbsp; He too is on the patch.&nbsp; Although he's a few days ahead of me.&nbsp;  The last time I tried to quit I became so bitchy my husband drove to the store and got me a pack of smokes.  He said: I didn't marry a bitch.&nbsp; And if you not smoking is turning you into one, by all means, here LIGHT UP!  I did.&nbsp; I lost the battle.   But I'm gonna do it.&nbsp; I'll keep you posted.&nbsp; I'll have to rearrange my schedule, my life, my activities.&nbsp; I'm dreading the weight gain, although I'm going to work out like never before.&nbsp; I'm dreading the withdrawl, the coughing, the nastiness.... but I got to do this.   Lacey wrote a blog on quitting smoking.&nbsp; She gave me insight.&nbsp; She gave me hope.  Patty quit smoking by chewing the gum. Granted, she's been chewing the gum for 6 years now, but STILL! There is hope for me. I hope I do not bitch any one of you out.&nbsp; If I do, here is my apology in advance.&nbsp; I am breaking&nbsp;up with my dependancy.&nbsp; I am leaving them for brighter days.&nbsp; I'm tired of their nagging, the sickly feeling, the scratch at the back of my throat. Those bastards! They are FIN!&nbsp;  So here's to July 26, 2004.&nbsp; Let my bank account swell with extra cash, my teeth become brighter, my smile wider, my life longer, my clothes cleaner, my stride longer and oh yeah, my HEALTH better!   &nbsp;

        I just want to send a shout out via my blog to my&nbsp;Voodoo Man!      Today he is the big 34! yeeeeouch!      :)        &nbsp;   He's expecting all kinds of party favors today.&nbsp; I'm sure the folks at his office decorated his desk with cheesy balloons , streamers, he may have even gotten a cupcake!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm also sure those aren't the kind of party favors he was talkin' about.     &nbsp;     Happy Birthday Voodoo!!      I wish you the best year and keep your eye on the mail!        &nbsp;   Love, Trixie

      Once again, while at lunch I see someone soooo hilarious.  To see something like this once is a gimmie.&nbsp; If it happens twice, you just lose it.   My girl and I went to Jersey Mike's for the BOGO thing they have going on.&nbsp; As we're standing in line Carie says: Oh my God Trixie, look at that man! I turn around and see, to my disbelief... the same man I had written about a few weeks ago.&nbsp;  The gay man wearing the Khaki colored daisy dukes.&nbsp; Crazy to see him once, twice hysterical... but to be wearing the same exact outfit... my Lord!   We cracked up the whole lunch.&nbsp; Not as bad as seeing Joe Dirt @ Wendy's, but close enough.   I sat wondering to myself about this small town I live in.&nbsp; It really isn't that small.&nbsp; 60,000 people plus live in town.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I just know too many people.&nbsp; Maybe it's my friendly nature, maybe it's because I grew up here, maybe I'm just living in the twilight zone.   The Voodoo Man, he knows my 11th grade English teacher! One afternoon, while we were discussing Lord knows what about the Native Americans, The Colonies, etc. He says something about Baker who played Davy Crockett in a PBS special. I said: Baker. MBaker?  He was my English teacher in highschool! Voodoo was in disbelief. (As was I) But alas, it is the same MBaker. Now how WIERD is that my friends?  That someone whom I know through a totally different connection and wave knows someone who taught me.&nbsp; Crazy.  Such is life.&nbsp; I think this circle I live in is quite amazing though.&nbsp; I missed it while I was away travelling and living my life overseas.&nbsp; I missed it while in Europe.&nbsp; I missed it even when I was in college.&nbsp;  I'm glad I've returned to all that I left behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm glad I'm a part of this town.&nbsp; My little Cold Sassy Tree.   And to see that man in those shorts.&nbsp;  It's obvious no one has yet told him that they look horrible.  Such a tradgedy.  Tuche.

      I woke up this morning feeling like ass.  My throat is tight, my nose is running, my eyes feel like they have sandpaper rolling across them...  Such is life when you have a child.  They can have a "touch" of something and within the next couple of days you've got the full blown plague.   I will soldier on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not because I'm one who feels the need to, but if I was at home I would just clean, do laundry and my day would amount to nothing much.&nbsp; I feel like I can at least rest a bit here at work! Sick ay?   So I'm going to be slow goin' today.&nbsp; Contimplating hitting my boss up for some medicine.&nbsp; Although I'm usualy anti-meds.&nbsp; Always been that way.  At 20 years old I can remember my Dad holding me down in the living room and dumping Alka-Seltzer Cold & Sinus down my throat.&nbsp;  I wonder where that all stemmed from? Hmmm.   Well, it is now time for me to sign on for work.  I'll be back at lunch with some amazing tale. Promise.

      Saturday was my niece Emmy's 3rd birthday.  What an amazing time!!  It was a Wiggles affair to remember.&nbsp; *For those who are unfamilar with The Wiggles, let me set you straight. They are 4 Aussie men, dressed each in Red, Yellow, Purple, & Blue shirts.&nbsp; They sing songs, dance, and well... it's the new millenium version of Barney & Friends.   So anyway,  After pinning the guitar on Murray (which my husband free handed and turned out GREAT!) We had cake and opened presents.   We got her Cinderella dress up and a Rainbow Bright doll. (see previous post) and she loved it.  A mutual friend of my husband and his brother, Chris, got her Princess Barbie AND Prince Ken.  I LOVED IT!   Once it was opened my Sis and I brought ourselved to hysterics over Prince Ken.  I know the whole thing has been beat down like a dead horse about his "masculinity" but c'mon... we couldn't resist.  The guy was wearing a blue silk shirt with a purple sash! His accessories are as follows:  1.&nbsp; One bouquet of flowers.  2. TWO other sashes (one white and yellow) to go with the OTHER Princess Barbies (Barbie of Swan Lake and Cinderella Barbie) yknow, so he can "coordinate with their dresses"  3. A pillow with 2 gold rings.   My sis and I laughed and laughed.&nbsp; First off, the flowers sucked.&nbsp; They were pink. Ugh! You'd think after all these years Ken would be man enough to fork out enough cash for RED!  Secondly, he had different sashes for different Barbies? What a jerk!! But we wondered aloud why Barbie would continue her quest with Ken after 50 years... no ring, no kids, nothing but a Barbie Jeep and his "promise"  I told my Sis that actually, I saw a commercial where Barbie dumps Ken!&nbsp; She gasped "Get OUTTA here!" Tis true!&nbsp; Cali Surfer Barbie met a hot surfer dude.&nbsp; You go girl!  But lastly,  We could just not get over his golden highlights.&nbsp; When we grew up Ken had plastic hair.&nbsp; Occasionally it was a different color, yknow, for diversity.&nbsp; Maybe for a little fantasy in the bedroom for Barbie.&nbsp;  But, man, Golden highlights.  The fellas really got into our conversation.&nbsp; Chris picked up Prince Ken and noted that his hair must be schlacked down with a bottle of gel and aqua net.&nbsp; That shite was not coming close to whippin' in the wind.  My husband wondered aloud to his brother if Ken secretly met up with Kit's husband.  What's this? My&nbsp;own husband knows about KIT!!!!   Do you see how the laughter progressed? My mother in law thought&nbsp;we were having tooooo much fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well isn't that the point of your kids' birthday parties? To play with&nbsp;all their cool toys? Hello!!! Where&nbsp;has she been? (ahem... for those of you who know me, please do&nbsp;NOT respond to that comment!)   When my son M&nbsp;turned 3 I was so pumped about the toys! Well, more so about&nbsp;the Incredible Hulk Pinata, but..  his toys were amazing...  Inline skates, spiderman bikes, remote control cars, basketballs, games, books...  I miss being so young and getting all these great toys.   Hey Mom, if you're reading this, will you buy me some of those pink play shoes&nbsp;with the pink fur? And maybe a&nbsp;Princess Repunzle Barbie?  Thanks.   &nbsp;

      We finally made it back home from Hotlanta.  That's not to say it didn't happen with terrential rains, mind altering traffic jams and witnessing car wrecks that haunt you for years... but we made it.&nbsp;  A normal 3 hr drive took almost 5. The last car wreck we saw was on I24, up near Jasper (outside Chatanooga).&nbsp; My God.&nbsp; I said a silent prayer as we passed this on the other side.&nbsp; The car was in half, twisted and the front half upside down.&nbsp; Traffic was backed up almost 10 miles.&nbsp; People were standing outside their cars, engines off, chatting to one another .  Later on, while at my Dad's house, he brought up the wreck too.&nbsp; They passed it shortly after it happened, and saw the paramedics removing the people in body bags.&nbsp; I again said another silent prayer for those families.   But let me tell you about the Mystery Books.&nbsp;  They also play into a part here.&nbsp; For I had said silent prayers when I passed that accident.&nbsp; Not because I wanted to or felt I had to. Something inside clicked in me.  It clicked on Saturday night while talking to my sister in law.   The two of us always talk in close, strict confidence.&nbsp; She is my big sister.&nbsp; I love&nbsp; her more than anything.&nbsp; Saturday night something so amazing happened between us, that I almost owe her everything.&nbsp; She reintroduced me to Jesus Christ.&nbsp;  Now,&nbsp; don't start thinking I'm going to go all TBN on anyone, because I don't think that will ever happen.&nbsp; I am a Christian.&nbsp; Was raised in church as a child,&nbsp;have been&nbsp;baptized, take communion, &nbsp;I just haven't been practicing very well.  My sister in law was never a Christian and just recently did become one.&nbsp; We talked for many hours and I truly felt a presence during the whole thing.  I wept Saturday night like never before. Pouring my heart out to her.&nbsp; Searching for answers to my questions, seeking comfort.&nbsp; She showed me how and where.  I slept that night so soundly.... it has been months since that's happened.   When we arrived home tonight, I ran to the mailbox.&nbsp; I always get excited about the damn mail.&nbsp; It's probably due to those Love Letter days.&nbsp; I also have a few pen pals.&nbsp; One in Kobe, Japan.&nbsp; Although she hasn't written me back yet, but then again she DID mention her English was bad. *(.... Let me just say right here.... I type like I talk.... That's why I'm alll over the place... my apologies!! )* Inside was a fairly big white envelope.&nbsp; I assumed it was from my Mom.&nbsp; A little something for my son.   It was for me. I was pretty confused.&nbsp; I never ordered any books! What could this be?&nbsp; My husband was right over me going "Lemmie see! Lemmie see!"  So like a little school girl I rip open the mystery package and what falls out?   A book and a study guide entitled: The Battlefield of the Mind.  A Christian workshop piece on how to have the Lords' help with your mind's battles against the Devil.&nbsp; Help with depression, worry, anger, fright, etc etc.  I started to cry.   My husband couldn't figure out why.  There is no way in hell my sister in law could have ordered and have those books rushed to me.&nbsp; Someone recieved those books @ their house and REsent it to me.  I was in awe.  The night before I sat telling my sis about all of these things, these battles, my search, quest, longing.&nbsp; And it showed up in my mail box the next day.   Divine intervention?  I think so.  And I'm looking forward to my new readings.

      We are headed to Hotlanta&nbsp; at O'Dark Hundred... so that's in about 5 hrs.   Why am I not sleeping? I'll tell you why. Because I came home and took a damn nap!  I couldn't help it.  After writing Love Letters today, all I wanted to do was come home and snuggle up to my man in bed.&nbsp; I only get to sleep next to him maybe twice a week (that would be an occasional Friday and Saturday).&nbsp; So that's what I did.&nbsp;  I woke up at 8p.m. NOT GOOD !!!  So I went and got my little man from my Dad's house and headed to Wal-mart.  Or, as M says: Mommy, are we going to Way-mart?  I had to get my niece a birthday present.&nbsp;  It reminded me of all the times I never played dress up.&nbsp; Instead, I spent them playing matchbox cars, Spy vs Spy and War with my cousin Kevin and my brother.  Kinda sucked in a way being the only girl.  So I went all out.  Cinderella dress, shoes, crown, ring, pretend makeup.&nbsp; I even threw in a Rainbow Bright doll w/ matching horse. (I was a HUGE Rainbow Bright fan when I was little) But the thing that pissed me off most,  They didn't have the cute pink shoes with the fur on them.  Man how I always wanted a pair of those. Bad!   I also could not believe I went to friggin' Wal-mart.&nbsp; I loathe that place.  As I was standing in the toy aisle there is some kid, screaming and kicking himself to hysterics an aisle down.  I looked at my son and we both were astonished.  Why the insanity?!  I will say that I got lucky and found a cashier with NO one in line. oooooh dog-gay!   Ok.. I'm really going to try and sleep now.  Ta Ta!

      My oh my! I'm headed to Hotlanta!  Just for over night though! Nothing like a quickie road trip.   Will y'all miss me?  I'll miss writing that's for sure.   But I'm looking forward to The Wiggles birthday party I'm attending around 12 p.m. , visiting with family & even my Secret Agent has asked me to call him for beers.&nbsp; How nice! Beers! I may take him up on that offer. &nbsp;  Have a good weekend everyone~ Trixie

      Last night I stayed up really late.  I was parked in front of the T.V. digging in the bottom drawer of our entertainment center.&nbsp; Which, I will add, is an old dresser we picked up in Japan for 1,000 yen (or 10 bucks!).   In this bottom drawer are an array of photos, letters, and cool knick knacks from our travels all over.&nbsp;  The ammo can that my husband confiscated off his ship&nbsp;holds all the coolest of cool photos.&nbsp; There's the one of the two of us in front of the giant Buddah at Kamakura, the two of us posing "tourist like" with iron statues of Jazz&nbsp;musicians&nbsp;parked on benches on the street, a photo of me, about 4 months pregnant in a tye dyed red dress in the park across from our apartment... the list goes on.&nbsp; They are all photos I cherish.&nbsp; And when missing my home far away (in Japan) I slowly pull out these memories to journey back to those fun days.   Beneath this mountain of&nbsp;photos from around the world are the&nbsp;Love Letters.   I look at them at least&nbsp;twice a month.&nbsp; Some are still in envelopes tied with twine.&nbsp; Some are stuffed in a paper mache bag I bought at the 100 yen store (Ahem.. yes, that would be the $1.00&nbsp;store!).&nbsp; Each letter is such a special treasure.&nbsp; And I'm about to tell you why.   My husband and I knew&nbsp;each other growing up.&nbsp; We were&nbsp;acquainted, but not seriously friendly or cuddly with one&nbsp;another.&nbsp; He lived&nbsp;with my&nbsp;boyfriend at the time, so we did see each other, but we never chatted.&nbsp; We didn't really like each other.   After a few years of living with my&nbsp;insanely "Shut your hole&nbsp;& know your role" boyfriend, RD moved out.&nbsp; And joined the Navy.&nbsp; I went off to college, leaving Mr.&nbsp;Down Home on his own.&nbsp;  On my final return to Mr. Down Homes place to collect my things, I noticed a letter on the countertop.&nbsp; It was from RD @&nbsp;bootcamp.&nbsp; I quickly ripped off a paper towel,&nbsp;scribbled the address down with a crayon and shoved it deep in my&nbsp;pocket.&nbsp; Why I have no idea. But I'm glad I did.   I held onto that address for quite sometime.&nbsp; I wrote many letters and tossed them all.&nbsp; What do you say to someone who you never really&nbsp; knew but was your nemisis&nbsp;half the time?  Finally I&nbsp;finished a short letter.&nbsp; I&nbsp;mailed it and the love letters&nbsp;began.   For four years my husband and I wrote letters.&nbsp;&nbsp;We held contests to see who could out do who on&nbsp;envelope decorations.&nbsp; It was the literary Olympics.  In my hand last night I held the winner...  It was a letter&nbsp;I sent. On the back of the envelope was&nbsp;Captin Kirk &&nbsp;Spock doing the&nbsp;Tango.&nbsp; It was some colored cartoon I ripped out of a magazine.&nbsp; On the front was a giant M&M guy giving the peace sign.&nbsp; Inside, the letter&nbsp;I wrote professed my love to my husband and how I&nbsp;longed to see him soon.&nbsp; Shortly after that letter is when I began to travel to Japan once or twice a year. (When you're in love, the others absence is sometimes too much to bear.)   We saved every letter. Every&nbsp;single&nbsp;letter for four years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my letters came from one&nbsp;location, of course, but all his letters are from all over.  Thailand, Austraila, Korea, Iraq, Jai&nbsp;Abili, Sopporo Japan, Okinawa, THE EQUATOR!  Each one is so special.   You see, I fell in love with my husband by corrispondence.&nbsp; It was a love story circa 1943.&nbsp; We never dated you see, we just wrote letters. Long winded letters, short and sweet notes, we'd fight in emails but make up via a letter.&nbsp; I almost expected him to propose in a letter.  Before my husband and I were married, I saw him once a year&nbsp;when he was on leave.  The third visit, he asked me to marry him.&nbsp; He had 4 cards placed out, each with a special caption to recreate the 4 special years we'd written each other.&nbsp; Each card had part of the phrase "Will You Marry Me?" written on the left hand side.  And on New Year's Eve we ran off to the Justice of the Peace.&nbsp; A super nice black lady who resembled the&nbsp;Oracle married us.&nbsp; Our families were there.&nbsp; I wore a blue velvet evening gown and my husband a blue and red shimmery tie.&nbsp; It was exactly how I wanted it.  It was official.&nbsp; I had married my sailor.   We still kept up the letters.&nbsp; Even when I moved to Japan, we still wrote one another.&nbsp; If even it was just a postcard of something corny.&nbsp; I would send care packages to the ship.&nbsp; Not just for him, but for the entire shop.  Everyone&nbsp;came to love our letters... or the envelopes anyway.  When our son was born , my husband was out to sea.&nbsp; I wrote him a letter while I was in labor.&nbsp; I mailed it to him when he left 2 weeks later after M was born.&nbsp; Back out to sea.&nbsp; As the Navy said : You can't fit your family in a seabag.  I tried like hell to fit ours into a letter.&nbsp;  After M was born, some letters became shorter in length.&nbsp; But I still kept it up.&nbsp; Those are the letters that made me cry.&nbsp; They are so sweet yet so lonely.&nbsp; I saw my husband for 2 weeks when M arrived.&nbsp; After that it was 8 months before I saw him again.&nbsp;   Today my husband and I&nbsp;are living in a quaint town, with&nbsp;a perfect fit house, a big backyard and our son.&nbsp; We come home from work and love each other.&nbsp; We play baseball in the backyard with M.&nbsp; We sit under our Cedar tree on a blanket , drink juice packs and eat cookies.&nbsp; We take&nbsp;Friday afternoons to remember why we are in love. We sometimes talk about the letters and life as we&nbsp;knew it in&nbsp;Japan and all the heartache it caused us.   If it weren't for the love letters, I would not be married.&nbsp;  If I wouldn't have written that first little letter I would not be Mrs. D.&nbsp;  But after the fact, if I didn't have those love letters I would have returned to Ms. M.  Those notes and confessions of love saved my marriage.  It's not an easy task like I thought it would be.&nbsp; I've been almost divorced 3 times.&nbsp; I've loathed my husband so bad I could've rung his neck.&nbsp; He hates when I don't fold the clothes and can't STAND the fact I don't clear the time left on the Microwave.  I hate his&nbsp;sneakers he wears with EVERYTHING and the fact that he quit&nbsp;shaving everyday.   You compromise.  You fall in love over and over and over again.  I look at him and am still as madly in love with him&nbsp;since the day the&nbsp;corrispondence's &nbsp;began.&nbsp; He is my everything.&nbsp; My handy-man, my pool boy, my editor,&nbsp;my chief, my Maynard,&nbsp;my sailor...   Sigh.  I love those love letters. &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      When I was at the dentist last week, I had a lovely assistant.&nbsp;  She was preparing to take a cast of my teeth and we were chatting a bit.&nbsp; Now why is it that when you're about to have something major done, then the REAL conversation begins?   As she placed the tray filled with yellow putty in my mouth she began with her bregade of questions.  "Are you married?"  "Ts m am. Tive errs" it came out. "Do you have any children?"  "s. ust n" I say.  By the third question I gave up and started to use eye signals and head nods.   Then she says to me:  "Has anyone ever told you you look just like Drew Barrymore?" (I nod my head once.&nbsp; Yes, I have been told that, but it's few and far between)"&nbsp;I mean, my God! It's uncanny! If you had blonde hair, you could pass for her!! Especially Julia Gulia from The Wedding Singer."   As my mouth is filling up with paste, I start to think....  What if this crap slides down the back of my throat, hardens and I choke and die? hmmm.  Then I started laughing.  The assistant thinks I look like Julia Gulia!  There's a guy at our Corp. office who calls me that too.&nbsp;&nbsp; I never really pay attention to the Drew reference, because I personally don't see it.  If I had to call out one resemblence, it would be the lips and the way we talk.&nbsp; They are very similar.   None the less...  What a nice boost to get while you've got a mouthpiece full of clay.  How sweet.

      Finally!  The 16th annual "You Are So Nashville If..." edition of the paper has come out.   I couldn't imagine the "You Are So Detroit If... you're Mom is the better crack dealer in the house" etc etc.&nbsp; I threw that Detroit bit in there because I just got the new issue of Playboy and it had an issue about The Motor City in there.&nbsp; Whew. I'm glad we moved outta that joint!   So anyway,  Are you ready for the winner's submission? It's a dandy.  Lets refresh.  Nashville is  A) In the South B) Home of Country Music C) Country Music = Huge American Patriotism  and ...  the winner says:   "You Are So Nashville If... You need a war to sell records!"   Ouch! I bet that hurt huh Toby Keith? HA!  I'm not a big country fan at all.&nbsp; Living in the same little town as Billy Ray Cyrus, The Judd's, and Vince Gill has it's perks sure... but I just can't get into it.&nbsp; I've tried.&nbsp; Really.   If I come across any other great blips in this edition I will surely post!

      I'm watching&nbsp;The Late Late Show or maybe it's Conan (oops, it's Conan).  I just want to say I've just heard the CRAPPIEST band ever.  I've seen bands at college frat parties that were better then those guys and I was most likely drunk! sheesh.   What is the world of music coming too?  Where is my Daft Punk CD? Where is my YYZ&nbsp; or 2112 by Rush? Can anyone please tell me how it is Jessica & Ashley Simpson have hit the Billboard charts together?&nbsp;&nbsp; All the lyrics rhyme , but you're hooked on that beat. That sickly sweet bantor of love at 19. You're sucked in. If only for a brief instant.   When will the pop madness end?&nbsp;  I want some Punk TV! I want my Indie/Emo bands back ... before it was trendy and hip to be sad.  I miss music!   And during this sad phase in my life, where a Pop Princess can dictate a religious following, I devote myself to my collection of: Sinatra, Holiday, Charlie Mingus, Duke Ellington, Lena Horne, Dizzie Gillespie, and my small collection of Blues.&nbsp;  Sing on my friends and save me from this personal music hell.

      This afternoon, I took a phone call from a loyal customer.&nbsp; It had been a few weeks or so since I had actually held a conversation with him.  Most of the time they are grunts and shouts to "GET 'ER DONE!" Not today my friends, not today.   As he's doing his usual routine of bitching and moaning&nbsp;about how shit sucks and it's all&nbsp;the plants fault&nbsp;, he actually asked if I had plans for this week/weekend.&nbsp; I'll be damned, he got personal!  So I responded : Yeah, actually! Today is my husband's birthday so I'm taking&nbsp; him out to eat with some family.&nbsp;   "Ah, your ole man's birthday. Yknow what 'at means ? He gets his one free BJ for the year!"  I nearly shite myself at my desk.  First off, this guy, whew. He's a big time customer.&nbsp; Secondly, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU SAY TO THAT!!!!  Do I piss off the customer who is a big time player with my company? Or do I ignore it and throw that polite Southern Belle laugh his way?  I chose the latter and just assumed he caught on to my decoy.   He did.&nbsp; And then he said "Just you wait girl. After 11 years of marriage, those birthday BJ's are a thing of the past.&nbsp;You'll never give one again after the 10 year mark."  I'm speechless.&nbsp;  What? WHA?  Is this guy having a shit day?&nbsp; Did his wife refuse to do a little fillatio on him? Or am I living a horrid nightmare in a 4 minute phone conversation?   My Secret Agent died laughing when I told him.&nbsp;  I cracked up myself.  It did add some sprinkles to my day.&nbsp; But man, I don't wanna be talking to him in the morning, that's fo' sho' !!!

        Mr. Pink was a guy I dated.&nbsp;&nbsp; We dated for quite awhile and even some after the fact.&nbsp; He was&nbsp;my bad habit that was hard to break.     &nbsp;He also had the coolest&nbsp;Blue Heeler dog&nbsp;who's name was&nbsp;Festis.       &nbsp;   One hot, lazy summer afternoon Mr. Pink and I were lounging on his front porch, in our skivies.&nbsp; (Hey, we were hot ok? And plus, Mr. Pink lived in God's country. No one saw!) I quickly saw Festis approaching the porch.&nbsp; Now, I say that this dog was the coolest, which he was, but God A'mighty, that dog stunk like something &nbsp;fierce.      So when&nbsp;I saw him sneakin' up the steps and eyeballin' the seat next to me, I had to protest.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   Mr. Pink asked me to quit my whining as he reached down to pet Festis.&nbsp; About that time one&nbsp; of his lovely array of felines decided to take up on the porch as well.&nbsp; What happens next is something I had NEVER witnessed and may never again.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   As Mr. Pink and I lay lounging on our porch swing with Festis and the Feline below us, there became a great commotion.&nbsp;      We paid no mind, because well, Dogs Vs. Cats! Must I continue the saga?      It wasn't that.&nbsp; There was no fighting going on here folks.        &nbsp;   I looked down and to my freaked out horror, there was Festis up on his hind legs taggin' that cat like it was the best piece of ass he's ever had.        &nbsp;   I SHIT YE NOT!        &nbsp;   And the most bizarre part is that the Feline just TOOK it!!      I said to Mr. Pink: "Are you seeing this? Festis is one sick mofo! Where's your camera?!"&nbsp; As Mr.Pink jumps off the swing to retrieve his camera, the action stopped.&nbsp;      Poor Festis was what we already knew he was.&nbsp;       &nbsp;   An old, decrepid, 2 hump chump.

      This afternoon while picking up the mail, I notice something different.&nbsp; Amist the vast majority of&nbsp;" Curb Appeal Lawn Care" flyers,&nbsp; "You're PRE-APPROVED!!!" , bank statements and what not, there is a letter. It's written in pencil. (That's still allowed?) It's addressed to me & my husband.&nbsp; A letter from my brother.   The last time I saw my brother's handwriting, I think he was 10 and I helped him with an English paper.  I open it.&nbsp; Half excited I got an actual letter, half pissed because I already know what it says.   Ahem. Dear Sis,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How it is Im doen good. Chillen.&nbsp; I'm on lockdown. word.  (* Swanee to God this is what it says, verbatem)   I won't continue, because frankly, it's my letter and I didn't know what to think of it.  I called my Dad.&nbsp;  Asked him to dinner and mentioned the letter. "Oh yeah?" he says.&nbsp; "I got mine yesturday. What's yours say?" I tell him. "Mmmhmm. Mine too. Same shit. Cry me a river." Says my Dad.   I can't believe it.&nbsp; I'll have to see this letter tomorrow.&nbsp;  But still, my brother sent me a letter.&nbsp; He still knows how to write, his handwriting is better, but his spelling! My God! An English teachers worst nightmare.  He asked me to send photos.&nbsp; Eh... That kinda creeps me out.&nbsp; What if his cell mate, yknow... well... forget it!  He asked me to write him back and tell him his flaws.&nbsp; He asked me to forgive him.&nbsp; He wants to do better.   I want to believe.&nbsp; You can only cry "Wolf!" so many times before folks stop believing.&nbsp;  I will give it time.&nbsp; I will probably write back.&nbsp; I will forgive.&nbsp; Not because I want to (because I don't right now) but because I'm his sister.&nbsp; And no matter what, he has to realize, when our folks are gone... it's me and him. Mono Y Mono. Toe to Toe.  I'll whoop his ass and back again.&nbsp; Why?  Because I'm the oldest that's WHY.  And I should've done it a long time ago.

        I thought that VH1 was my last hope at "music television."      That seemed to stop a few years ago.      I can remember vividly watching&nbsp; "Jump" by VanHalen on my T.V. as a kid. My folks upstairs in bed sleeping in, and hearing my Dad yell " TURN THAT SHIT OFF NOW GIRL!"&nbsp; What happened to all the music?&nbsp;      I WANT MY MTV! (and for those of us in Gen X & Y: I WANT MY VH1!)        &nbsp;    I've now suffered through I love the 70's, 80's and what's this? I love the 90's? Get the hell outta here!      The few times I remember watching these shows it was either A) late late at night B) I was drunk and it was late late at night or C) It was early on a weekend and I was sobering up. (Do you see a pattern? ha!)        &nbsp;    So this evening, I'm settling into the couch playing couch commando & listening to my husband bitch (because I skipped over the Discovery channel) when I come across: "I love 93!" What? I love 93? Wasn't that just a few years ago? Wasn't I in high school? huh?      I look at my husband &amp; he says to me:      "Turn this shit off. We don't need to watch it. We LIVED it!"        &nbsp;    I am immediatly consumed by a huge fit of laughter.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's right... we DID live it.      I can tell you where I was when OJ was avoiding arrest (at my boyfriends house, giving into the munchies & watching the saga unfold with a boy named Chan) or where I was when I bought my first Nirvana album (downtown Nashville , chillin w/ my friends and a bum named Booger) and where I was when Cobain took a dirt nap ( working at a local head shop convincing local authorities that "No sir, Officer, we do NOT sell these bongs for the use of Marijuana) and slap bracelets? Jesus. It never stopped.&nbsp; Furby's? I was in college, too drunk to remember those things!&nbsp;        &nbsp;    I thought you were suppose to wait 20 years before kicking in an era? I mean, with I love the 70's I was lost.&nbsp; I kept thinking: Damn, my folks were like, in 11th grade when this came out. Weird!      I love the 80's? I could relate. Elementary school shit. I was a Care Bear for Halloween, I loved Strawberry Shortcake like a sis.&nbsp;      I love the 90's? What the hell is there to love? "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em?" The Real World? Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch?&nbsp;And the fall of the anthem 1999? Surely you jest! &nbsp;        &nbsp;    The whole segment blows.&nbsp;      Should we be expecting "I love 00's" in 2010?      I hope not.&nbsp;      If I see it, I'm definatly giving up my post as couch commando. Indefiniatly.

      Yesturday, while shopping in Big Lots, I saw a woman attempting to read the info on a childerns computer game.&nbsp;  She was really squinting at it.&nbsp; So much so, that I wanted to run up to her and say: Ma'am, may I read that for you?" Sheesh.&nbsp;  She had&nbsp; a little girl in her cart who was probably 4 or 5.&nbsp; Upon further inspection, I gathered that she was a home school kid.  The little girl had on this blue jean dress that looked like someone recycled their "Hamma' Pants" it also had a horrible white Pilgrim collar with balloons on it.&nbsp; That whole outfit gave me the heebie jeebies. &nbsp; So I was staring! Big deal! But at least it was behind a rack of Cheetos.&nbsp; As the lady is squinting to read the regular type print, I notice her start to jiggle her keys, as if tossing them to find the right one.  &nbsp; To my surprise, what does she whip out? Not a key, but an Eye Spectacle!&nbsp;Surely you jest! I do not! A little bitty pirate looking spectacle.&nbsp; She had it held up to her right eye while the left eye was closed.&nbsp; "AHH Madaline, there we go! Oh this game won't work for a Mac.&nbsp; We can't get it.&nbsp; Try again sweetheart."  I was so astonished.&nbsp; I thought it was odd.&nbsp; I've never seen an eye spectacle.  &nbsp; It wasn't the type that clips onto your eye, like&nbsp;the round one Sherlock Holmes wore.&nbsp; It was a simple piece of plastic that was hooked on her keychain.&nbsp; I wonder if she got off an infomercial.&nbsp; Maybe off an old pair of glasses.&nbsp;  Shit, who knows!&nbsp;  &nbsp; I would've asked, but by that point I realized I left my purse sitting on the floor down in the panty aisle.&nbsp; Where, I might add, I found  the cutest&nbsp;&nbsp; pair of green bikini&nbsp;underwear.  And on the&nbsp;front, there is a golfball on a&nbsp;Tee that says: Hole in One.  YEAH BABY!   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Sunday night I was at G's mom's place after the funeral.&nbsp; I didn't go to the burial, I was just a bit overwhelmed by Saturday evening.  I did show up, with my little M in tow.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were all laughing, drinking, jammin' out and remembering G's brother.&nbsp; Then B shows up with his new Mrs. and shit hits the fan.  &nbsp; My girl C cannot deal with this whole situation.&nbsp; I've tried to tell her "It's water under the bridge" I don't sweat it, why should she? Shit changes when you grow up... or it's suppose to be that way with some people. B &amp; the Mrs. are looking for homes in our town.&nbsp; They are moving back! B says: Aren't you excited Trixie? (Oh, yes! Why I couldn't wait! Pfft. Please) C loses it and storms inside. &nbsp; So C suggests (after her fit) that we hit her casa and go swimming. Hey, I was game. Granted it was 930pm on Sunday and my kid was hyped up on sugar!&nbsp; So we all pile high and take a ride.  That dip in the pool did us all good.&nbsp;&nbsp; For an instant we forgot all our worries. And then M falls in the pool.&nbsp; Thank GOD he had on arm floaties and of course, I was right next to him when it happened... but still, ugh.  &nbsp; I decided to hit the road about 10ish, and as I'm walking out to my car what do I see? C and Sam alllll over each other.&nbsp; Tsk Tsk girl. Tsk Tsk!  I called her last night to get the scoop, I got nothing because they were all together. But I got an earful this afternoon folks! &nbsp; C is now in loooooove with Sam.&nbsp; He's moving here.&nbsp; (Not because of her she says, but because the cost of living is cheaper than on the Shore, and he misses G, she's just an added perk!) If any man said I was an "added perk" I'd smack him in his Yankee mouth!  So,  I'm dreading it all.  The moment something falls apart, the whole thing will blow up in her face.&nbsp; And I will be the one who's the outsider looking in,&nbsp; lending a shoulder and cursing it all.  &nbsp; I still can't believe C &amp; Sam hooked up.&nbsp; I thought to&nbsp; myself&nbsp;did it happened due to grief,&nbsp;did it happened because he was bored,&nbsp;did it happened, just because....  &nbsp; Ah, such is life when you're friends are single! :)  So I say "COMPI!" to the hook up.&nbsp; It's about time my girl got a good piece of ass.

      I've just returned from a most fabulous trip to the dentist.  I had to have a crown put on.&nbsp; You'd think I was having major surgery, but my Lord! I've had perfect teeth my whole life, and to hear that I had to have a crown just shattered my record.  &nbsp;  First off I want to say that people who work in the dental profession DO NOT need to wear glasses.&nbsp; I tried like hell not to look up, but my curiosity go the best of me and I did.&nbsp; I looked up.&nbsp;  And when I did I almost barfed all over myself.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I mean, honestly, do they have no disreguard to this?&nbsp; It's like a mirror! I see, in the reflection, my mouth gaping wide open, tools dangling out of it, drool mixed with blood, and my tooth, that was once square is a small, cylinder shape.&nbsp; Thank God the dentist stopped to take a mini break and let his assistant do some too.  &nbsp;  I hadn't realized this was a "learning" expierence for him.&nbsp; That shit always happens to me.&nbsp; When I was giving birth to my son, I had about five young men, all booters, all under the age of 20 staring at me in wonderment. "Oh Mrs. D, this is a "learning" hospital.&nbsp; These young booters are preparing for medical school through the Navy. Do you mind?"&nbsp; What option did I have?&nbsp; I was doped up on an epidural, my husband was thousands of miles away in the ocean and it was just me, giving birth to an audience.  &nbsp;  And here I was again, having dental work done to an audience.&nbsp; Lovely.  &nbsp;  It has been 3 hours since I recieved the numbing shot, and I am beginning to wonder if it's going to wear off.&nbsp; I became a bit panicky when I had to sign release paperwork.&nbsp; As I'm reading it, I feel myself beginning to have a panic attack.&nbsp; I'm wishing I was at work so my girl Valucinda can hook me up with a Xantax.&nbsp;  Reading the above it says (I will paraphrase here)  You hereby give Dr.Tooth the full right to do whatever he wants.&nbsp; We will be administering a small anethethic.&nbsp; However you may incurr some side effects such as nausea, vomiting, particial loss of feeling in all , or portions of your face.&nbsp; This may be temporary or permanent. (PERMANENT!)  &nbsp;  Oh the horror.  But I survived.&nbsp; I really did.&nbsp; And I think my crown is too high.&nbsp; So for the rest of my life I may have a crooked bite.&nbsp; But that's ok.&nbsp; Really it is.&nbsp; It could have been worse, I could've had to have a root canal and a crown on top of 4 fillings.&nbsp; I didn't.  &nbsp;  I really think I will write a letter to the ADA and let them know about their employees who wear glasses though.&nbsp; Nothing like a little Jim Rose Circus being reflected back to you an hour before lunch, while you sit helplessly, half numb and scared.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I've recieved 4 collect calls from my brother in 2 days.  "Hello?" I say "This is a collect call from "Ziggy", an inmate at the Dept of Corrections. To accept please press 1. To deny please press 0.   I always press 1.   The first call was to thank me for the supplies I sent.  Even though the deoderant I threw in was confiscated.  Yeah.  That plastic center core? It can be used as a weapon.  I personally cannot see my brother trying to make a shank out of some plastic tube, but hey, I'm not the bailif.   There were some other calls in between, in which my husband talked to him.  The fourth call was this afternoon.  I pressed one, and on the other line is my brother.   His voice is slow and tired.  He wants to know if I will be visiting him today.   I tell him I will try, but that I promised M I would take him to the park.  If I make it home in time I will try to visit.   I am just torn.  I do not want to visit him right now.  I'm pretty sure I'll be too angry.  Really, the whole place depresses me.  It's loud, echo-y, bright and I must say bright orange is not my brother's best color. There are no phones like you see on TV.  There aren't even holes in the plexi-glass.  You have to yell.  YELL people.  Along with 14 other inmates and their wives, mothers, and kids.  It's the worst 30 minutes I've ever had.   When I talked to my brother, he says not to worry! JOY!  That he knows he'll get a year or more, but if he gets on work release, he can get out in 8 months.  I like how he called it work release.  It's the Chain Gang for shit's sake.  He'll be sporting black & white stripes pickin up trash on the side of the road. I see those guys on my lunch break.  I always think: Damn, what shit luck.   I told my husband that I don't know what to do.  That I'm starting to feel bad b/c I haven't seen him.  My husband said: He has not called you, talked to you, or even visited us in 4 months.  Now he wants to be your best friend because he's lonely and needs some fucking toothpaste.    I agree.  And I'm not going to see him today.  It's 3pm.  Visitation is up.  I don't know when I will see him.  And I'm not going to worry about it anymore.

      I just returned from G's mom's house.  The whole clan was back together.&nbsp; Chillin' out on the back patio, drinking SoCo, and laughing up a storm.&nbsp; It was as if this whole week never existed and we were back to summer time hang outs.  The whole scenario was beautiful.&nbsp; I enjoyed and cherished every moment, for I don't know that it will ever happen again.  &nbsp; I saw G laugh, alot.&nbsp; We talked about how we used to be. When those days were brought up G said:  "I remember when Trixie had the color wheel going on with her hair.&nbsp; And don' be lyin' girl, you know you wore curtains!"  I spit my SoCo out on the table. "It wasn't a CURTAIN! It was a very cool, hippie dress. And for your info G, it had a lickable tag in the back that tasted like chocolate! " We all cracked up.  &nbsp; I met B's wife too.&nbsp; She's older than us, and, as I predicted, a total knock out.&nbsp; In an earthy kinda way.&nbsp; She is a very bubbly kind of sorts.&nbsp; I enjoyed her company.&nbsp; When I had a moment with B, as we were walking down the drive, he hugged me.&nbsp; I told him "B, no matter what road we take, I want you to know that I truly wish you and your wife the utmost happiness in life." He broke down and cried.&nbsp; He said he was so sorry for not calling, or inviting me.&nbsp;  " No sweat B.&nbsp; Life has changes.&nbsp; I have no hard feelings. " I said.&nbsp; I cried with him.  Not because we were upset at our own personal loses, but because we knew the real reason for&nbsp;us all to be together.&nbsp; And that this life we had all been leading had come to a full circle and chapters were closing.  &nbsp; Let them close.&nbsp; I am ready.&nbsp; For I know who I am, what I will be, and what I will become. &nbsp;

      The last time my brother was in jail, he told me a few stories.  For some reason, they just jumped into my mind.  &nbsp; One evening, shortly after his release, we were sitting on my front porch having a smoke.&nbsp; He was still wearing his ID band and talking the same story about how he was going "to change."  While we were out there, I asked how the food was.  Not that I was overly concerned that my brother wasn't getting a well balanced diet, but I was curious.&nbsp; Most prison movies I've ever seen, it looks like shit on a shingle.&nbsp; Paste, muck, or the like with a fruit cup.&nbsp; I've never thought to ask. So I did.  &nbsp; Ziggy said that they had oatmeal and toast for breakfast.&nbsp; Which, unfortunatley , was served about dawn.&nbsp; Then around lunch,&nbsp; he said,&nbsp; which was served mid afternoon, was usually an egg salad sandwich with a handfull of chips.&nbsp; Unfortunatly for my brother, he was in the last cell, on the last row.&nbsp; So, if you can imagine an egg salad sandwich, and then having to wait over an hour at room temp to recieve it, you'd probably just pass on it.  Dinner was usually grilled cheese sandwich.  &nbsp; He did however say that they had a commissary.&nbsp; And that he begged my dad to put $5.00 in his "account" so he could buy Snicker bars, Ramen noodles and Cheetos.&nbsp; Small luxuries we take for granted folks.  &nbsp; Want to know how our incarcerated population eats Ramen without a microwave? It's fascinating and it makes me wonder what else they can cook.  First, you bribe your&nbsp;cell &nbsp;mate to trade you 2 Snickers for one cup Beef Ramen.&nbsp; Then, you slowly peel back the plastic wrap and lid. DO NOT REMOVE THE&nbsp;COVER! &nbsp;You will need&nbsp;it in the future!!! Second,&nbsp; let your water run to it's hottest (which would be luke warm in prison) and fill up your cup .&nbsp; Third,&nbsp; take the plastic wrap that you peeled off the cup and shove it in the drain of your sink.&nbsp; Set your cup of Ramen over the drain filled with plastic, fill, and let sit for 20 minutes.&nbsp; VOLA!&nbsp;Luke warm, slightly crunchy Ramen! Fresh for you!  &nbsp; My brother said it was the best food he'd ever eaten.  &nbsp; Then he went into the stories about his cell mate.&nbsp; He said this guy was strung out 24-7. That he told my brother every way to make crack.&nbsp;&nbsp;Home made crack, street sellin' crack, the "good" crack that you sell to the drug lords, the "bad" crack that you sell to the ho's.&nbsp; He said it went on and on.&nbsp; And not just for a few minutes or even an hour, but ALL night and day.  Could you imagine? I couldn't.  I kept picturing someone like Gary Busey all junked out with ashy lips telling my brother how sweet he was.  &nbsp; I'm not up for anymore stories this go round.&nbsp; Maybe he'll skip me.&nbsp; Or maybe he won't and I'll be able to make a best selling novel out of it!

      This afternoon, on my way to K-mart, I stopped at the corner store for a Coke.  Not a Coke in a plastic bottle, but an honest to goodness Coke in a glass bottle. Yum.  I had my hand in my purse digging for some change, so obviously I am not paying attention.  I get hit by the huge glass&nbsp;door of the store.   But guess what?  Mmmm Hmmm my faithful readers!! It is someone I know! Who? Who?  I'll tell, with a bit of background.  &nbsp;  It was Jimmy.&nbsp; Jimmy who was always a little too redneck for me. Bless his heart, he was just so sweet.&nbsp;Very&nbsp;handsome, but a tad too redneck.&nbsp; He took me&nbsp;out a few times.&nbsp; He's a local boy (was a local boy, now a local man, my bad!) and when I worked at the corner store he would come and visit.&nbsp; Hell, he worked behind the store, so it wasn't like I never saw him.  One night, over supper Jimmy says he's got a secret.&nbsp;  ooooh yes! A secret! yummy!  &nbsp;  As I'm about to bite into my steak, Jimmy tells me he is moonlighting as a mortician.&nbsp; He then proceeds to explain how to peform an autopsy, embalm, makeup, hair, and this guy who came in with a fence post thru his skull.  I set my fork down.&nbsp; Jimmy says: Oh my lands sweetheart! Where are my manners!  Snap snap of his fingers and he's ordering me a salad, 86 the meat.  &nbsp;  After dessert, he took me to see that guy with the fence post in his head.&nbsp; The next day at work I had 3 dozen roses waiting for me.&nbsp; I never dated Jimmy again.  &nbsp;  And he hit me in the head with a huge glass door this afternoon.  You'd thought he'd seen his favorite pin up girl! That boy was so excited! Trixie Trixie!  I sat and chatted with him out front for a bit.  &nbsp;  He bought me a push up.&nbsp; And  apologized  for that night of our date.  &nbsp;  When will I ever escape this madness? And why did I agree to come back to it?

        Just for starter's I'll say that I am probably going to try out every single color on my template.&nbsp; FYI.      **     I talked to my Favorite today.&nbsp; He called this afternoon.&nbsp; I hadn't talked to him in a couple days.&nbsp; I was glad I got the chance to tell him about all the shit going down in my life.       &nbsp;   He tells me: Trixie, I don't call for a couple of days and look what happens! You start a whole new season of Springer in your life.      Tis' true Favorite. Tis' true.        &nbsp;   I can't help it though!&nbsp; I keep thinking of all the chaos that is swirling me again.&nbsp; I keep visualizing it leaving my hand .&nbsp; It's not working this time. (go on ahead and laugh Mr. G Tarot if you're reading this. And you better not call me &amp; say told you so!)       &nbsp;   I'll be glad to have the chance to talk to my favorite again.&nbsp; Whenver it may be.      ~~~~~~~~~     I also went to K-mart today.      Not my choice might I add.      But let us float back to about Tuesday... Remember? My little brother is "incarcerated".      He called my husband today and said he needs:     Toothbrush (I bought him a purple one.&nbsp; The Power Puff Girls one was too expensive).     T-shirts (I  almost  bought V necks)     Underpants (Passed the tighty whities... I could do that to no man).     Well... he had a friggin' list.&nbsp; So I piled it high in my cart, against my will. Everytime I thought about not doing it and walking out, I could hear my Dad saying: Trixie, if your brother calls &amp; asks for a toothbrush, for Christ's sake take him one.      I haven't found the long johns as of yet that he requested.&nbsp; My search never began.&nbsp; So technically I couldn't finish it.      The whole time I kept thinking about him being in jail.&nbsp; The last time he was there, I visited.&nbsp; It sucked. And I won't do it again.      Last time I was there, I'm trying to hold a conversation with him thru plexi glass.&nbsp; He's high fiving the guy in the next booth... they went to school together.&nbsp; My bro says: See sissy? I know people here. Don't worry!      Oh my GAWD.&nbsp; I was pissed.&nbsp;      I still shake my head and wonder.... where did this boy come from?     **      My husband commented on my hair before he left for work.      "What's with the updo babe?"      I know I know.      I was sewing! I had to keep the hair out of my face.&nbsp; And personally I thought the little clip of hair I had twisted up looked cute.      Ahem. I was mistaken.      No score for me. :(&nbsp; Ohwell. Such is life.      **    &nbsp;

        So it's almost time to go home.      I'm looking forward to it.  Some of the girls want to get together after work for a Sour Apple Martini or two or three or....       But I don't know if I'm up to it.&nbsp; That whole mess last night with G has got me wore out.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   I did recieve a call from C. She said B was in town and that his face went 3 shades of white when she said "Congrats!" B said : for what?&nbsp; DUH. You got married right?      Yeah. He thought she didn't know. (see me rollin' my eyes)        &nbsp;   I called G to see if he needed some extra help @ his casa... but they were picking out caskets when I called. Perfect frickin' time Trixie.      This whole thing has thrown me into a tizzy.&nbsp; I don't want to over step my bounds, but I want my buddy to know I'm here.&nbsp; I made that clear, so I think I may just step back for a bit.&nbsp; Unlike C who has thrown herself into "personal assistant" mode. It drives me crazy.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   G did mention that B was in town.&nbsp; And that our friend (ms.C) had his number.&nbsp; He started laughing.&nbsp; Mmmm Hmmm... She HAS his # and won't let me have it.&nbsp; See, even after all these mother grabbin' years the games are still being played. LET IT GO GIRL! LET. IT.&nbsp; GO! I am in no way looking to meet up with him &amp; conspire against you like you think. I swanee to God.        &nbsp;   So anyway...      While we're sitting on the couch last night @ G's mom's house, C says: I can't believe this happened.&nbsp; But if it takes a tradgedy to get us back together then so be it.     I'm sure my eyes bugged outta my head.        &nbsp;   She did NOT just say that? Yes she DID! Holy shit. How rude!!! How can you say something like that?! I'm not worried about playing catch up w/ a bunch of friends right now. I'm here to lend a hand to my buddy and his family during this extremely shitty time. Sheesh.        &nbsp;   I'll get off that subject.&nbsp; I see it's still a hot one after 10 years. Jeez.      Well, It is time for me to go for the day.&nbsp; I may be posting tonite. I think my man has a hockey game... or was that last night... hmmmm... I'm lost.        &nbsp;   Till then. XOXO

      I just received word from C that our friend B will be in town today.  Granted it is for the funeral of G's brother.  But non the less, our circle will be complete.   I have not seen B in years.  We have not talked.  I heard he recently got married.  And I'm sure she is beautiful.  Our friendship became more than that, and when we ended it , angrily, it never revived itself.  The whole thing just simply fizzled out. And when it did , the whole circle crumbled shortly there after.   I am looking forward to seeing B. I am looking forward to having all of us back , if even for one day & one unfortunate circumstance, together.   I do not, however, know if B wants to see me.  I am not too worried about it.  Everything will pan out.  I feel like I'm reliving that Big Chill movie.   I feel like I'm walking thru a dream.

      I recieved an email from an old acquaintance yesterday.  She said she's hooked on my blogs, but can't determine which is fact or fiction.   My darling, it is ALL fact. :)   I feel safe knowing that only a handful of people know about my blogging quest.  Maybe one day I'll start a TOTALLY anon blog and NO one will know it's me!   So my old acquaintance has great pictures of all old friends I haven't seen in years.  It makes me smile to check it out.  It makes me jealous b/c her site is awesome and I want to learn how to do that. I'm a tad jealous because she is in Chicago where it seems all cool things are.  We each chose our own path. I am so happy , for her quest seems to be going well! :)   Reading her blog makes me miss my travels. She's been all over to the places I want to go! Fiji! sigh. How marvelous. But I got the real scoop from her Open Letter to the The Lonely Planet... She has pictures of some of the girls who I went to Europe with.  I still have one picture of the 2 of them embraced in a devilish hug on the steps where , in the movie Mary Poppins, that old lady asked "Toppins! Toppins for the birds?" That was a great trip. And MRM tried to smuggle numerous bottles of wine home.   I do miss a lot of things. That's how life works.  You tend to always remember and miss.  Everything in my life (my life meaning me, my husband and son) is normal.  I come home, we eat supper, we talk about our days and play games with M.  It feels like a security blanket , my little family.  Even with Abby (aka Kitty The Hulk) scratching my ankles and licking my hair all the time.   Life feels right and perfect.  I like it.  Sometimes I loathe it though.  For I want to run off with my friends for a weekend in Florida. Take off to Paris for my anniversary (Which, was to be for the big 1 year, but we were living in Japan and I was 6 months pregnant!)   One day I'll go back to all those places.  I threw 3 coins in the Trevi fountain. I believe in wishes.   When I do go, I'll take my 2 favorite men and we'll eat extra ice cream and go to Piccidilly Circus.

      I've got something that bothers me terribly.  This may only be a thing that happens in the South, I don't know. But I cannot stand it anymore!   While I'm on my break, sitting outside in a perfect morning (maybe 77 out) an older man gets out of his teal Ford Taurus. He's wearing a faded dress shirt, khaki pants, carrying a shady looking briefcase and....  He's wearing cowboy boots.   UGH!   Almost every older man I see who is in a business setting has on cowboy boots! I just want to scream:  NO YOU'RE WALNUT COLORED JOHN WAYNE BOOTS DO NOT LOOK GOOD WITH CHARCOAL SLACKS!!! Their pants ride up at the ankles when they walk. Sometimes you'll catch a glimpse of a black sock or white leg.  The whole scenario can be quite disturbing!   I can only hang my head in disbelief when they pass by.  It's one thing to be a cowboy and wear your boots with a kick ass pair of wranglers, but please, please PLEASE don't let anyone convince you that your boots look great with dress slacks. Because they don't.   And one day that mans wife is gonna rise up and flee her life all because she was tired of the boots.

      Yesturday afternoon my close girlfriend called me.  Our great friend G, his brother had died.   Not the greatest news to hear at work.   I lost it.  I was at my desk and just lost it.   By time I got home @ 5pm, C was in my driveway and we were headed to G's mom's house.  G wasn't there, he was with the investigators. His brother was struck by lighting while working inside an attic. His heart simply exploded. G found him. And he's blaming himself. So we sat with his mom & G's wife.   It was an uncomfortable silence.  I felt his mother's pain. I'm a mother now.  It took everything I had to pick up my son yesturday and not burst into tears.  The whole way home I thanked God for that hug I got when I walked in the door. I thanked God I could listen to my son's stories about his day. I just simply thanked God for all I have.   When you're overcome with so much grief, it's amazing how everything becomes so much louder.  Maybe it's because you're so quiet.   When G arrived at his mom's house C & I were his only friends there from the old gang.  His brother was always in our way growing up.  But that's how it was suppose to work. I would come over and G's brother would say : Can I hang with yall PLEASE? G would say: If you wash Trixie's car, sure. And after he was finished he'd get to hang with us..   I got home late.  My husband didn't know what to say to me.  But there's not much to say in certain situations.  I was glad to be home. In the comfort of my couch and my son's arms.

      I'm really draggin' today.  I know I said that @ 5:30 this morning, but I can't shake it. I picked up a Coke on the way to work, hit up 3 cups of coffee, and I'm still not with it.   Yet I digress, I have things to do and things to say, so I'm skipping my lunch time nap. :)  I received a call yesterday afternoon from a friend of mine.  He's been mentioned on here before.   He says to me: Trixie, did you read the latest Newsweek yet?  Sorry Hoss, I haven't had time. I used to be a subscriber, but I let it run out, yknow. And now I'm shrugging my shoulders wondering why I DID let it run out. It's a decent magazine... Oh!  So anyway, Mr. B mentions that Newsweek has an article on how more and more women are cheating on their husbands.  How they are feeling more liberated and equal to them, and therefore can act like them. How most relationships start off in the workplace. Why not says Mr. B? You talk to these people more than you may talk to your spouse.  Mmmm Hmmm...  I see your point.. And then I begin to wonder where he's getting at with this.    Has he heard some stupid rumor about me? Am I OVER friendly to my Secret Agents? Nahh.  He's just rambling.  But it did catch me off guard. What a random thing to bring up. I hate when people do that.   I guess it's a similar feeling to, say, if you had just finished smoking. And instead of putting your butt out in the ashtray outside, you flick it, and it soars thru the air only to land in your bosses OPEN convertible car. SHIT THE BED!  Now imagine,  the next day your boss walks up to you and says:  I read this article, about smokers, and how they have a penanche for flicking cigarettes and the effect it has on them.  They even had a confession from a flicker who burned out his bosses car on accident.   And then walks away. That sinking feeling, that's what it feels like.  Not that I'm cheating on my husband with a co-worker, because frankly, I work with ALL women. I'm not a switch hitter. That bit of information lets me know, that he really was just bringing up a random article.   I have no idea what the hell I'm typing now.  SEE! I told you I was tired! If people say I'm cracked out because of this blog, I'll delete it.  Back to work I go.. Oh wait, I still have time. I'm gonna go sit outside and roast.

      In my line of work, I'm on the phone from 7:30 a.m.- 4:30 p.m.  After about a year, I finally figured out I have speed dial. DUH! A small luxury that comes from working at the cube farm.  I also have 6 secret agents that I am in charge of.   I have listed them by favorites on my speedial.    One of my secret agents is *02.  Not by choice mind you.  He replaced a secret agent who left his post and he acquired his old number, which was *02.  I guess I'm just too lazy to change it.  He really should be *05 but I've left it as is.  *02 Agent is a very needy, hyper-active fellow, who can get on my nerves.  He's been working here for over a year, and still asks questions that can be answered by a flip of his page in the manual.  I know he's not calling to hear my voice, he just honestly does not know.   So, when I feel like ribbing him, I remind him he'll never be *01.  "Ooops! You messed up there! And I was just about to make you *01 too. Sigh. Back of the line you go!" I'll say.  I can tell it fires him right up. He can't handle it. This not knowing who *01 is.  I'm sure , if he was smart enough, he could just ask one of my sneaky girls to go punch *01 and all his questions would be answered.  But he hasn't done that yet. Not that I know of.   *01 has been permanetly in place for 2 1/2 years.  I just can't jerk him off the list because *02 thinks he's worthy! I mean honestly! Who does he think he is? :)   I'm sure this whole thing sounds absurd to an outsider, but I can't change my speedial list. It's an impossible task. It would consume 8 minutes of my day trying to figure it out. I can't be havin' that!   This afternoon, if I happen to talk to *02, I'll let him know that he got to make a special guest appearance on my site, and that he'll never be *01!

      I have a girlfriend who is borderline psychotic.   Not in an artistic/manic way, but a stalker why won't you be my boyfriend way.  I have not talked to her in a couple of weeks, I'm pretty sure she's avoiding me.  And I'll tell you why.   She and I share a mutual friend, Bart.  When we were growing up, Bart and I were thick as thieves.  At one point I was in love with him but he didn't love me.  Then he loved me, but I didn't love him.  The whole thing was a whacked out tennis match of love.  somewhere in between all this Peggy got thrown in the mix (this is a code name I'll give her, since I can't think of anything else).  The three of us became great friends.  Well, Bart and Peggy had their own kind of friendship, and Bart & I had a special friends with benefits kind of thing.    So for years Bart and I are living this secret double friendship life.  When the 3 of us would hang out, either with each other, or with a Group, we kept things on the DL. Once it was time to go home , we were all over his bed like two Ethiopians wrestling over some KFC.   Then I got married.  And Bart moved away.  Peggy and I drifted apart.   When I moved back home, Peggy and I picked up what we could of our friendship.  She still kept in touch with Bart.  I did not. She told me how he was planning on marrying this 18 year old girl (I think we were in our mid 20's at this point). He proposed to Rose in front of Peggy at Fall Creek Falls.  She went ballistic. And called me crying the whole drive back.   After that quick "engagement" I received a phone call from Bart.  He couldn't marry Rose because he still loved me, wanted to be with me, would I move to Florida , blah blah blah.  Whatever. I'd been married 4 years, I had my son, and he wants me to drop it all? For him? Nooooooo way.  After all these years of trying to figure out why Bart was so understanding, caring, and the best lover... I came to my own conclusion, He's GAY!  And I made no qualms about letting him or Peggy know my conclusion.   A few weeks ago, Peggy called me.  I believe this is how it started.  With her phone call.    She was sobbing and quite livid.  "BART GOT MARRIED! To some girl he's only known a YEAR! She's a Miss America contestant!! " And I couldn't get a word in anywhere.  When she finally asked : "Aren't you upset?"  I could only laugh.  "Peggy, why in God's name would I be upset? I have not been friends with Bart in years. If I was his friend I'd either A) be in the wedding or B) would have at least gotten notification!"  NO I DON'T CARE! And I'll tell you why... It's a front! He's GAY . G-A-Y. My step brother called him on it, my Dad said he was "different" and my MOTHER even said he was Gay.   Peggy isn't seeing the light.  She isn't with the program.  It'll take her years of therapy.   And I won't be around to hold her hand.  I just can't handle the drama.  I've got enough.

      Yesturday, I decieded it was time for my son to get a haircut.  No big deal.  I've done it before.  Just get the clippers, turn 'em on, shorten the sides & back.  Hmm. That's how I've watched RD do it.  So I took it upon myself to cut M's hair.  As I turned on the clippers I took one looooong buzz up the back of M's head.  To my horror, I look down and see his hair missing. ALL of it (or where I buzzed).  Amazed, I look at the clippers, perplexed. What the hell? RD must have saw the confusion on my face & came out there screaming " WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING TO HIM!!!"  Well, hell!  I'd seen him cut his hair a jillion times before, it's not like it's hard! (ha!)  My husband immediatly grabs the clippers from me and says: Jesus honey! You're using the shortest guard! look at his head! oh my gosh! My neighbor next door, Larry, was watching the whole scene unfold.  I could see him turning his head to contain his laughter. Well, RD was able to fix the mess I created, but now M is sporting a "high n tight" military style.  Okinawa style.  Jar head style. This morning he wanted to wear his cammo Army shirt.  He looks like a young military guy straight out the jungle.  Needless to say my Clipper priveledges have been revoked. Permanently.

      Just finished cleaning up the house.  Eewww. Time to pick up the hundreds of green & tan Army men and put them in their resting place. Depending on how they meet their fate they have three options: 1. Go back to the toybox 2. Get thrown away (due to missing arms, guns, etc. NEVER on purpose, right?) 3. Sucked into the vacuum cleaner.  Now, I really hate it when I suck those guys into the vacuum.  I have to turn it off, turn it upside down and stick my hand into a mess of hair, yarn, plasic wrappers from juice pack straws & the like to save him.  To which he will just be tossed into the trash.  So it's Saturday.  A beautiful 69 degrees outside, sunny, not a cloud in the sky.   Perfect perfect day.    And I'm sitting here typing like an idiot!! DuH!! Well, once M gets home I'll be outside for the rest of the day/night.  So I'm enjoying me time! :)

      Tonite, while in line at the gas station, I see someone I know.  Imagine THAT!!! This girl I grew up with walks thru the doors.  It's as if time has not changed her.  She looks exactly the same. She has 2 kids now and actually lives in the neighborhood across from where we grew up.  As we're standing there chatting about siblings, spouses, school & general BS I ask: "How are your folks doing?" She says: "Oh, my Dad had a heartattack a few months ago. " Oh my God! I say "He's not dead though.  But get this... As he's HAVING the heartattack my mom calls & says Jamie, I think your dad is having a heart attack! What should I do? " DUH! Call 911 she says. THEN!! This is something my mom will appreciate, for she knows the terminology... As her Dad is pretty close to a dirt nap he calls into work for an EVAC DAY!!!! Only our Dad's.  Only they would do something like that. We both starting laughing hysterically.  For we could see her Dad calling in, head on the kitchen table, one hand clutching his chest the other calling into the plant! "Uh, yeah... I need to speak to a Team member or an Ombudsman.  I need to take 4 hrs personal time & an evac day. Yeah, I'm actually having a heart attack right now, so I won't be in."  The more we talked out the scenario, the more hysterical we got.  The two of us had to take it outside we were getting so loud! So there we stood, Jamie and I, clutching our bellies in laughter.  Only two kids of UAW members would get it.  Only two kids who caused their Dad's so much grief & worry would get it.  Damn it was good to see her!

      Ok. I dyed my hair. No big deal right? Oh my GOSH no.   If I hear ONE more time: Oh, Trixie, I liked your hair blonde.  Oh, Trixie, you look so pale. Oh, Trixie, I miss your highlights. Oh, Trixie, you should have left it alone, now what have you done??? I will absolutly LOSE it.  Leave me the hell alone.  I got tired of having blonde/brown/gold hair.  It was pretty much 4 different colors (if you factor in the grey).  So whatever. Change is change. My hair is ONE shade darker than my natural color people.  Get over it. I know it's probably the first time that most people have seen it it's "true hue" but ugh!!!  Its starting to give me a complex.  I'm starting to not feel the same ole same ole anymore.  I keep thinking and waiting for the next comment.  Let it be folks. Let it be!!! I contimplated doing some highlights, but... Knowing my luck, it would turn orange or yellow and I'd have to deal with THOSE comments.  However, Numerous GOOD friends have stated that I: A) Look my age B) Look like a professional C) Look like a Mommy (well, thats on the borderline) D) LOOK NICE! Thank you to those people. When someone makes a shit comment about my dye job I can see my sis in laws face when she saw it.  She liked it, her husband liked it, MY husband liked it oh, and I LIKE IT. So beat it.

      Yesturday I was browsing CNN.com like I usually do in the A.M, and I came across a quirky little article. 3 Phillipino guys are being charged with killing and eating their COUSIN.  What?!!! Ok, so this is the lowdown: This guy's daughters getting married.   As she's walking down the aisle, his cousin falls out of the pew & slaps the daughters ass.  The dad & brothers get pissed.  Once the reception starts, they take good ole boy out to the woods, stab his ass and roast him over an open pit w/ some Kerosene.  Yep. The dad forces one of his sons to take a bite!!! THEN!! yes, theres a THEN... They take parts BACK to the wedding and feed it to the wedding party!!!! Apparently everyone was too drunk to notice that "Hey, this doesn't taste like chicken!" There are only a handful of sickos out there that really KNOW what humans taste like, so since everything else tastes like chicken, why not us?  Man.  I knew the Phillipinos were crazy, but this tops the cake!! When I lived in Japan, the base was crowded w/ the Flips.  Not that I'm being a rascist.  There isn't a bone like that in my body.  Being the minority for the first time in my life, I got to see how other cultures viewed us Americans.   I couldn't even get a JOB on base because I was white. Yep! Hard to believe.  They wouldn't even hire me to keep track of how many people came in the NEX.  And all you had to do was sit there for 7 hrs a day!! Not to many sailors were fond of the Phillipino population on base.  I couldn't really tell why.  Maybe it's because the spoke TagAlog while they checked you out, deposited your check, picked you up in a cab.... The Navy has a rule that if you are from a different country you are to NOT use your native tongue while at work or in front of anyone else in a "non" personal setting.  Security measure? hmmm.  Probably.  So anyway, I was pretty grossed out by the fact that this guy & his sons roasted up their cousin and ate his ass. (well, it couldve been an arm or thigh... I don't know! ) Off to work I go! Trix

      Last night after supper, I promised M I'd take him up to the store for an icecream. Or as he says: "Mom, can we go to the Poptart store?"  It's the corner market up the street from our place, but M calls it the poptart store b/c that's all we ever buy there in the morning.  SO! I get redressed, pull my hair back somehow and speed off to a cool, refreshing push up.  Once I got to there I realized I didn't have any cash.  Blah!! But! I would not be deterred! I just put it on my account!! Ed wanted to throw a fit about it.  He said" Is your name on the list?"  Is my name on the list? C'mon! This isn't Studio 54!  Hell yeah I'm on the list! I"ve been coming to this store long before you even thought about it! Don't get sassy with me! He finally, after a long arguement, let me charge 2 Push Ups, a large Evain water, a pack of Basic Ultra Lights (THANKS TO YOU NET! haha. J/K) and a Poptart for the morning.  Ed says to me: You better come in here tomorrow and pay this Trixie. I said: "Ed, I'll pay it when I want.  Bubba knows where I live so beat it."  Aside from that little confrontation, M & I took our seats on the bench out front.  Having a good ole tasty treat.  Well, mine WAS good till I started watching M eating his.  eeeew.  Those of you who don't have kids will not understand the peril I talk of.   It shouldn't be that difficult to eat an icecream, but then again, he isn't yet 4.   That stuff was all over him, the napkins, his legs, MY legs, ugh. The sight of a once solid food turning into liquid starting to attract bugs & dirt just grossed me out. Just about the time I think about giving up the fight I see someone walking up the street.  It's Jelly. Don't ask me what his real name is, because I haven't a clue.  He's this black man that I've known pretty much my entire life.  All I can think of is Debo from Friday.  How everyone runs when they see him.  Never the less, I stick it out.  And here comes Jelly. "Whar yew ben hidin' gurl? I hant saw yew in yurs. " He says between puffs off his Camel & whatever he's chewing in his mouth. Oh Jelly Jelly Jelly.   You just SAW me yesturday in the store you FOOL! So, Jelly joined us.  M thought he was quite comical.  Those two were laughin' and carrying on.  We all were. For a brief moment I felt like I was living in Cold Sassy Tree, GA and it was 1935.  Weird.  Like I had an out of body expierence on that bench... that is until a motorcycle blasted by.  It was pretty good to see Jelly, eat an icecream with my son, and teach him that all he ever needs to know, you can find out sitting right there on that store front bench.

      This morning I got half way down the road and realized I'd forgotten my lunch. Suck. Everything I do in the morning is on a time frame.  I seriously threw my whole routine out of whack.  I could see my day crumbiling before me, all because I forgot my lunch & had to go back. That's ok though.  When I got back to the house,  I ran across a compilation CD w/ all these great songs on it.  Our buddy Cliff made it for us.  Well, more so for RD than myself.  As I'm cruising along, my son and I rocked out to Dinosaur Jr, Fugazi, Clockhammer, The Beastie Boys and my most favorite... HELMET. Man it was an awesome ride.  Plus, it's always great to see the other working moms do a head spin when I pull up to the daycare.  Nothing like a little hard rock to get your day jumpin'!!  I feel it's gonna be a GOOD day! Can I getta hell yeah? :)

        For the past week I've been noticing this one Dad at my son's school.  He and I arrive & depart at the same time every single day.  I thought it was kind of bizarre.  How is that possible that a total stranger pulls up behind you the same time everyday?  At exactly 7:02 a.m.?   It's weird.      Aside from that, we've never spoken to each other except for a short smile from me or a nod from him.           Yesturday afternoon as I was getting out of my car, I saw Suit & Tie Dad walking twards the door.  I smiled at him.  But he caught my smile just as some little boy pushed the door open.  So, Suit & Tie has his head turned to the left as he's smiling back and then WHAM.  Oooooh. I bet that left a mark.           This morning , I notice we're both fighting with our kids to get them out of the car.  As we approach the door I said: " Good Morning! How's your head feeling today?"      "Much better.  That kid got me pretty good though!" he said.          I'm not sure if this whole little scenario will amount to anything news worthy.  I'm sure my days will continue meeting Mr.Suit & Tie every morning and every afternoon.       I'll keep y'all posted!

        I had the most horrible dream about Detroit last night .                                                                                                                                                                       I've actually been planning a quick get away trip to the Motor City but after this dream, I feel like it's not such a good idea.      The dream I had was so graphic and violent.  I've never expierenced anything like that before.  I actually knew I was there, in that city, in that horror forever.     My husband woke me up because I was screaming.           In my dream,      my Uncle picks me up from Detroit Metro in the mid morning.  As we're walking out of the glass doors, we see a giant plane over head.  I said something to the effect of : "Wow. That plane is really low!"  Once those words left my mouth, the plane exploded into a glass building across the street.      People were running twards me missing limbs, bleeding profusely, screaming for help.      As I began to scream I looked at my uncle, who pointed out there was another plane flying horizontally twards a building to our left.  He pushed me under a bus. I begged him to come with me.  He kept saying he couldn't . That plane  crashed into the building to our left.     When I started to crawl out from under the bus I was screaming for my Uncle.  There were more limbless people, more blood, more screaming.  I couldn't find him anywhere.      I began to wander the streets of Detroit.  Jumping over puddles of blood and in total disbelief.           I'm thinking that there is some reason for that dream.  Something or someone is telling me I won't have a good trip.      So I probably won't go.           I hope to God I never have another dream like that for the rest of my life.

        Y'know, I'm getting a little tired of "all the drama in the LBC!"      A girl can only handle so much information before we go into system overload.      I'm beginning to get burnt out on who is sleeping with the New Guy in the office for the week, who's doing the drugs, who's got an international boyfriend,  who is sleeping around, who looks like a total HO wearing high heels.... UGH!!!           I'm just over it.  Way over it.       I feel like in someway I'm floating above everyone looking at all this nonsense.      It's so childish.  Am I being childish for writing this blog about it?      Probably.      But I'll feel much better after I do.           I'll have  a bit of weight off my shoulders.  I'll be able to make room for the new info.  Lord knowing what it will be.  I'm not going to be turd stirrer and blow everyone's cover.           But there is way too much drama.

        I began thinking about all the secret things I've ever done.      I began thinking how I like to keep them secret.  How I enjoy the fact that I know things that no one else knows.  How I sometimes hide my inner thoughts.  What does that do to me? What does that say about me as a person?  How in the hell did that all start?           I believe I may be close upon the answer.  My family is thick with secrets.  Secret meetings, secret conversations, secret lovers, bank accounts, travels, lives, everything secret.       I know no different.      I see now what is meant by "learned behavior."      That frightens me.           I feel normal.  I look normal.       But what if one day I wake up and decide I don't want this anymore?      Yet in the same thought...     There's no sense in "what if-ing" myself to death.  It's absurd.           I made a promise to myself.   I will not keep secrets from MY family.       I will also teach myself how to cook, how to sew better, how to interact with other moms, how to love better, listen more,  roll my eyes less and just simply embrace each moment.           I will also say a Farewell to my secret thoughts.      Maybe I can't become the "brilliant" one because I keep it all hidden away.  Tucked neatly in secret little spots throughout my life.

        I cut off all my hair today.      GASP!!!      Ok, so not allllll of it. Just the back. And the sides. Oh, and he gave me bangs. Something I've never had.     Most men I know freak out over the whole "hair or no hair" issue. I had long hair for a majority of my life. When I was 16, I walked into the salon and told the lady to cut my shoulder length curls into a tight Pixie cut. She refused until I threatened to call her manager over. haha.      I've had short hair ever since. Sometimes it's a longer version of a bob. Other times, I just simply chop it.           My first semster in college, I buzzed my hair. Every girl on my floor thought I was a lesbian. That is until my dorm attentdant, whose nickname "Moose" fit her to a T, walked in on me and my boyfriend. Ahem. I think she wanted to ask me out. EEEEE Gads!!!      So see? At least one guy was diggin' my Freedom Phase. :)          I'm now sporting a stylish, punk / professional hair cut. Big kudos to my step brother who not only A) cut it into a great style, but B) got it straight! woo hoo!      Gone are my summer curls! Well, for the moment. Once I wash my hair, the curls will return, much to my dismay.           I feel so much better. I don't think men realize the power of a great haircut and manicure. I did however trade off on him "practicing" his "dramatic" make up techniques on me.      Joe has recently been working with many of Nashville's up & coming stars. He does their hair, makeup, etc for photo shoots, album covers , and whatever big event they have planned (Dove awards, CMA awards, blah blah).      So when he mentions : I need to work on my "Dolly Parton" look, I'm already freakin' out.      And what exactly is the "Dolly Parton" look?      Whatever it was, I wasn't stickin around to figure it out.           His next request was that we need to "get my ass into the salon for a new color."      I don't know about y'all but I personally like my chesnut colored hair with it's few strands of blonde streaks.      I'm not ready for a whole "new" color.      Lord knows what it would be either. Knowing my luck, he'd turn it dark Red, or God forbid Black. Hmm...          Looking forward to greeting the day with my friends shouts of " OH MY GAWD YOU CUT YOUR HAIR!!!"      I like it. I know my husband LOVES it   (  He says I look hotter than ever   )   and to my Dear MB: Don't worry Sweetheart, you'll love it. ;)

      Mr. Pink was a gentleman I dated for quite some time over the course of a handfull of years. He most recently disappeared from sight after marrying some local chick who resembled Jay Leno.  I do not lie here folks.  I saw her picture in the paper, without any encouragement whatsoever, 3 people pointed that out to me!  So, Mr. Pink had been MIA from my sight for quite sometime.  I'd occasionally see him here or there in town on my lunch break.  Once while sitting out front of my office building, he actually pulled into the lot!  Seems his job requirements are to fix existing phone issues area residents may be having.  Being totally stunned by seeing him I figured it to be a freak encounter.  eh, I was off a bit.  I've been seeing Mr. Pink more often driving around town. Most recent was tonight. While pumping gas I hear: Whoooo Weee lookie har! "Oh good gosh A'mighty" I say outloud.  Seeing Mr. Pink in town is no big deal.  It's usually in passing, with a freindly hand wave.  But when he starts to stop and talk, my radar goes up.   I know alot of people, alot of people know me, they know about Mr. Pink & I, and they know our present states. I hate when he stops to talk.  Ab-so-lutely HATE it.  He got out of his big, gianormous , electric blue Dode 4x4 screaming 5 pumps down from me: " Oh my Lawd, look who we have here! Ms. Trixie M in the flesh! Lookin' mighty fine girl!" Ugh. I thought I'd puke right there. Mind you I'm wearing cut off sweats, an old Skateboard tshirt of mine, & flip flops.  This maniac has the audasity to say: " God dang, you are still as beautiful as the day I threw yo' ass out of our place!" I'm ignoring him at this point.  And had begun a conversation with my son in the backseat. "Momma, who is that crazy guy talkin' to you?"  he says. "Oh, I don't know sweetheart.  Some folks are just sick in the head and they talk to anyone. Don't forget that either."  Mr. Pink keeps getting closer and closer to me.  I'm thinkin' about that can of mase in my glove box,  screaming FIRE when he gets next to me, or even spitting in his face.   I do none of the above. I instead act like the most perfect, polite Southern Belle you'd ever had Mint Julip Tea with. "Why Mr. Pink! How the hell are you! I see that you've been eating well! Bless your heart, that new woman of yours must know how to only cook meat and potatoes!"  "Aww c'mon Trixie, ain't no need to be a wench.  You know it was now or never, and since you didn't wanna marry me, I picked her." he says. What?  That jerk off threw ALL of my belongings out in our apartment complex parking lot.  In the middle of the night! I come home from work to find him in a not so nice position with my ex roommate, her furniture moved in place of his, and my stuff all over the place. When did he ever talk of marrying me? Pfft. Maybe to his folks, or to Festis, never to me that's fo' sho'.  Well anyway, I finished off the conversation as quickly as possible.  I drag my son by the arm into the store, forgetting to buy half the nessecities I need, and bolting outta there. As I'm cranking the key to my car I look over and see him glaring at me.   Uh huh.  I see how this is.  Two can play this game.  And I secretly wish I lived in Seattle,  Tijuiana, Minneapolis or even Nova Scotia. That bastard.

      The time is now 7:11 p.m. Let me recap my weekend!  Friday night, I didn't do jack.  My husband stayed at his shop all night and by time he got home he crashed.  Who could blame the man? He'd been up for 28 hrs by time he saw me.  Sigh.  Such is life when married to the night shift.  Sometimes I say: Y'know Honey,  you can't fit your family in working Midnights. He just rolls his eyes at me.  Saturday.... What a day!!! RD wakes me up at 630 AM! I mean, C'mon!!! And to go eat at Waffle House at that!  Ugh, I got heartburn upon the thought of it! I slid my ass out of bed, crept into my painter's overall's, a wife beater and threw a ball cap on.  I ate the most greasy meal ever.  If I had had a hangover, it definatly would have cured it. Headed to my Pop's house where my step mother and I drove ourselves over to the County Jail to visit those in the "General Pop". I went to go see my little brother.   First time I'd seen him in months.   Man had he aged! He's 19 and looks older than my own husband (who is creeping up on the big 3-0 here shortly!) He was wearing his stripes.  White and Black stripes that is.  So we knew he got on work release. For everyday he works, he gets 2 knocked off his sentence.  What does that mean to me faithful readers? Jack shit to be honest. Or that he may be home in time for the New Year.   If he plays his cards right.  Later on that afternoon, after my short 30 minutes locked down in visitation w/ Ziggy,  RD & I went to my brother's digs to get some of his belongings. Apparently my brother and his roomies were running a pretty big drug operation out of thier apartment.   I'd visited his digs twice I believe.  Both times the place was spotless.  Not this time. I almost puked upon entering.  There were empty beer boxes, old pizza boxes, coffee cups and bowls filled to the top with cigarette butts, half smoked roaches all over the kitchen counter, I counted 3 pipes and a half bag of weed on the coffee table.  I wanted to get IN and OUT of that joint asap.  My husband on the other hand, wanted to linger and snoop. FOR WHAT?! Ugh. Men. There was no one in the apartment when we arrived.  By time I was writing the note that said: Hunt: I took the Xbox & TV b/c it wasn't yours.  If you have any beef with that call my damn father. Later, Trix. About that time I hear "What the F&$&amp;@!!" I turn around and see some cute little ghetto thug white boy, his very white trash girlfriend and their entourage.   I explain the situation and the kid actually asked me to leave the TV.  Eh, No.  Sorry bitch.  It's not yours.  By time my husband and I got home Saturday night around 8pm we were exhausted.  We were looking forward to a nice, cool relaxing time vegging in front of the TV. What's this? It's 89 degrees in my house?  Lovely! Our air conditioner went out.  Of all the weeks, days or times, it had to be Saturday. Luckily my husband called Opie One Kanobe (ha!) to come fix our air.  When Opie arrived,  I noticed that this 60 year old man looked familiar. AH HA! It was Mr. Opie! From the corner store! :) He fixed our unit (a blown fuse somehow) and, due to the fact that he knew me, charged us a very, extremely tee tiny fee (compared to the disasterous amount it shoud have been.) My husband was in disbelief.  And planted a big ole kiss on me for knowing everyone in town!  Sunday... that's today. It's not going so well.  RD went and bought a suit for his Granny's funeral.  Who, by the way is still not passed on.  They say it will be tonight, or in the morning, or next week maybe.  Whichever the case, I know I'm headed to Atlanta for a few days.  Everyone is making a big friggin' deal out of what we're "suppose" to wear.  I've never dealt with this kind of obsurdity before.  Who gives a crap what your'e wearing! You're there to mourn the dead not to model the newest Steve Madden shoes! Oy Vey! Also, RD & I have made the desicion to NOT take our son.  He's only met his great granny a handful of times in his life.  Not that I'm being disrespectful, but my son is not yet 4.  I don't think he's ready for this expierence.  My sister in laws kids will not be in attendence either, so I feel ok. RD tried on his suit for me too.  I almost passed out! The only time I've ever seen my husband look so dashing was when he had to wear his Johnny Cash uniform in the service.  And I told him so.  And there you have it folks.  A quick , paraphrased recap of a quick, exhausting three days.  Until next time America.
