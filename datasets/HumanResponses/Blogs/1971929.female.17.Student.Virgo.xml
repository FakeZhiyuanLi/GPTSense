      Well, after careful consideration, I've realized that I would be too disturbed by the thought of going out with Jared. I mean... not disturbed exactly, but it wouldn't be right. Of course, I will try my best to move on. So far no one knows about the break-up excluding my mother, best friend Talley, and whoever Lucas told. I at least know he told his mother and his sister Rachel overheard. Anyway, I'm still uber upset. I'm not sure how long it will take for me to get over it. Oh well, it's in the works.

      I've done some thinking, and I've decided that if I were to have a rebound relationship, it would have to be with Lucas's best friend, Jared. I mean, I'm pretty good friends with Jared, we talk all the time, and it would really make Lucas mad. The only problem would be getting Jared to go along with my master plan. See, the thing about Jared being Lucas's best friend, is that he's his best friend, so the chances of him betraying Lucas are slim to none. On the other hand, it is Summer, and Jared just might be bored enough; maybe even desperate enough to try escape such boredom by way of my plan. So Operation Jealousy has commenced, though the odds of success are lingering. If all else fails, I'll just hook up with some random guy from the beach or something. I think June will be dedicated to Operation Jealousy or "OJ" as I have decided to call it. Bring on the envy.

      Well, well, well. It seems that I, Julie, have been, for the first time, dumped. I'm really kind of shocked here. I mean, I saw it coming, but then again I didn't. So here's what happened: School let out on Thursday of this week. I didn't see or hear from Lucas at all that day, or Friday, or Saturday, until I finally decided to break down and call him. I had talked to his best friend, Jared, about the possibility of Lucas breaking up with me and Jared said (this is a direct quote) "I can tell you with 100% accuracy as his best friend that he wouldnt do that". Well thank you, you dirty liar. When I called Lucas I used the premise that I wanted him to help pass out programs at the graduation with NHS. (I'm an officer, by the way, so it would make sense that I would try to recruit people for this.) He said he would help me and when we hung up, for the first time ever, he didn't say that he loved me. Now I was a little confused. After he came to pick me up, 15 minutes late might I add, we started on our way there and again, for the first time ever, he didn't hold my hand as we were driving along. Obviously, something was up, so I asked him if it would be alright if we just didn't go and he felt that would be fine. As we started back I began to cry because I knew the inevitable was about to occur: he was going to dump me. He noticed the tears and asked me what was wrong. After no reply he pulled into the parking lot where we had our second date; the place where he had first kissed me. Again, he asked me what was wrong and this time I told him.  "I'm afraid."  "Of what?" "I'm afraid about you."  "Why's that?"  "I think you know." Oh, he knew alright. We talked and according to him he was dumping me because of my friend Talley, because I'm a pushover, and because I automatically assume the worst about situations. Of course, I cried... and cried... and cried some more. Then he threw out the can-we-still-be-friends line and I started to bawl. When I finally got him to take me home I was able to hold back my tears and joke about the situation sayin things like "At least now I have a reason to eat too much ice cream" to make him feel less awkward. After we got home I got out of the car before he could open the door for me, the little bastard, and sat on the driveway where he gave me a hug and two kisses: one on my head and one on my forehead. Then he held me between sobs. The last thing he said to me was "Goodbye, lovely" wich really pissed me off. How could he say that? It's going to be so hard to see him now. Everytime I looked up and my eyes could see clearly enough to make out his face, I broke down again. I love him so much. I told him I would miss him, and he said he would miss me, that dumbass. I don't understand him. Of course, I've decided to go out with someone else as soon as I can to make the little jerk jealous, and believe me, he'll get jealous. Now to pick a target...

      What the crap happened today. I said I had plans, did I not? Apparently Lucas (my significant other) didn't want those plans to fall through. The intention was that I go have dinner at his house upon the request of his mother. For some reason unbeknownst to me, the little jackass didn't call. Not only that, but when I called, no one answered the phone. Obvioulsy, something is awry here, and it's not making me too happy. In fact, I'm pretty pissed right now. Yesterday, he said he would call me, but he didn't. And when I called him, he wasn't home. Of course, he got home eventually, but somehow found it unnecessary to call me. Bastard. I hardly ate anything at the crawfish boil I went to this afternoon, and I left there early so I'd have enough time to get home with enough spare time to primp myself more than usual. I even went out and bought something special to wear to dinner tonight, but nooooooo, Lucas doesn't even call me. I'm so mad at him. Wouldn't you know my luck? The day after I start this blog announcing that I love the moron, he dumps me. I can see it happening. Guess I'll just report back tomorrow with the news. I hope the rest of the world had a better day than I did.

      As ways should have it my life is at an impass, I've lost all sight of the habits of a life of normalcy and thus I come here, friendless and I, as the evergreen, have turned brown. On a more positive note I've become more interested in reading, preferably about history, which in turn increases not only my knowledge, but ability to intake knowledge, which, can be considered a good thing. So here I am, 17; a youthful age, and this time in my life is perhaps to be considered the best years of said. Too bad. My life isn't going to be too much fun now, is it? I guess you could say I have a few friends, only a handful. I do have a significant other, I'm quite fond of him actually. All in all, however, I AM sitting at home on a Friday night. Of course, in all fairness I'm being punished (for something untrue, need I say) and I do have plans for tomorrow night. Alas, my motivation for remaining awake has faded, and I know revert to a state I would prefer to be found in: sleep.

      Totally had a bad day yesterday. I found out that everyone thinks I'm annoying, and Lucas dislikes me. Then just now Jared tells me that I'm a good person, but I need to acknowledge my faults... ow... that one hurts. Apparently it's annoying when people compliment you and you don't believe them. I guess I'm going to just have to start taking compliments without contradicting them. I think that's one of the reasons Lucas dumped me - because I wouldn't believe him when he said certain things. Anyway, enough about that. Talley's finally back in town, and raving about a band called  urlLink The Elms . I've never listened to them so I don't know that they're any good, but Talley's in love. She's going to marry the chubby one, Thomas. He amuses me because he's chubby. I'm gong to be the maid of honor. Even though she hasn't asked me yet... The garage sale is supposed to happen this weekend. I really wish it wouldn't. It's Independence Day weekend and I don't think we'll draw much of a crowd, so it'll be a waste of our time. Oh, and I've decided that either Monday or Tuesday is to be dedicated to Ocarina of Time. So one of those days I'll be missing in action until midnight that night when I either succeed or fail. For Hyrule! By the way, death to Trevor for telling me happy Canada Day. Watch oot, eh?

      Well, Warped Tour comes back tomorrow, but I'm not going to be attending. I've been getting horrible random pains since Saturday afternoon and they tend to last for a few hours, then get worse for like five minutes, then suddenly go away. I'm not sure that's a bad thing, but I know it's not good. Not to mention the fact that I still haven't gotten a ticket and it's starting an hour earlier than it would have on Friday. I don't want to be a burden on my Warped Tour companions. All I'll do the whole time is be like "Oh... I don't feel well... I'm going to sit down." And they'd be like "Ugh!" and that would be their way of expressing their annoyance. So, I feel it's better that I don't go. Therefore, the saga ends with only three parts to it. Shame on me.

      Oh, my God. That is the only reaction I can blurt out between the sobs after seeing this movie. After trying the whole movie to hold back my emotions, I let he rivers of tears stream down my face when they're finally together at last. Oh, it was such a great movie; the best movie I think I've ever seen. I cannot express how great this movie was. Of course, don't go see it just because I say it's tremendous. Everyone has their own opinion, but mine is that this is the best movie ever. Everything was excellent: the acting, the actors they chose, the plotline, the ending, the script. I couldn't have imagined a better movie. I don't think I've ever wanted to burst out into tear so much in my life. It was so wonderful, I just can't stop raving about it. In my eyes, it's the greatest movie of all time. I'm going to buy it on video as soon as it comes out and watch it all the freakin' time, because I'm in love with it. Oh... I clench my heart as my eyes swell up with tears.

      We now begin to follow our hero on her journey to Warped Tour. A journey of intrigue, suspense, action, and cancellation. As our story begins, our hero is riding in the car with Ashley, sister, and sister's friend. She has procured shotgun and her head is filled with excitement. She is on her way. However, a quick stop to pick up friend Rachel Cornelius ends in tragedy after a broadcast airs on the radio.     "Um, well it looks like Warped Tour is going to be postponed until Monday. That's Monday. It seems that they were unable to setup due to the torrential downpour last night, of course they will be back on Monday, so don't worry about the wasted money," the announcer person said.    Our hero's smile now turns upside down, but is interrupted by a phone call. Ashley answers:    "Hello? Yeah, I know, we just heard it on the radio. OK. OK, bye."    Could this be the end for our hero? Will she survive yet another day's workload of garage sale duty? Tune in next time for Chapter Three of our saga: The Return of the Tour.

      So I was just hanging out out MSN, like any normal day when Ashley gets online. So I started talking to her and we got to the subject of Warped Tour.  Ashley: "I hope it doesn't rain too bad since it's tomorrow"  Me: "Yeah, and make sure to video tape Taking Back Sunday... or I'll kill you."  "I know. Why don't you just come?"  "I don't have any money."  "Don't you have a bank account?"  "Yes... I guess I could dip into that."  "Well do it woman."  So after a rather lengthy conversation about circumstances and the plan of action it was decided that I was going. So I woke up early today, showered, went to the bank and took out $100 (not sure what all I could use it for but you never know), bought myself breakfast at Shipley's for $2, and returned home to dress. Oh I have really bad hiccups right now because I ate so fast. I don't know that any of you have ever heard me when I have the hiccups, but I make this rather annoying squeaking sound. It hurts when I hiccup. Poor me. Anyway... Ashley should be here any minute now. I hope I don't have to sit in the back with her sister and her sister's friend, although her sister amuses me. I'll come back with the details probably this afternoon. Peace out... :S

      Do you know what time it is right now? 9:15. 9:15... at night? No, 9:15 in the morning. But isn't that before noon? Yes, yes it is. This isn't right. I'm not supposed to be up before noon, especially since I went to bed last night at 3:30. I have to go finish painting at the Bayou House. We missed a wall. Of course, the woman wakes me up at 8 even though all I had to do was eat, so of course I choose to sit here on the computer and waste time. Ugh, this garage sale is going exactly as I had expected. No one is doing anything, and Rachel's complaining. I feel psychic, but I'm only psychic on Tuesdays. I think my system may be awry because I woke up so early today. How did I get so weird?!?!

      So here's the thing: This coming school year I'm going to be a senior. That means within a matter of months I have to start applying to colleges. What college shall I choose? This is a decision that affects the rest of my life. Do I get to pick any college that I want? Of course not, because my mother has popped out five children. All of whom, must go to college, paid for by my parents. Thus, I am told that I cannot attend any out of state college, nor any private college. I've always known I don't want to go to A&M or UT because they're huge schools and I really don't like crowds. So what does that leave me with? Basically, I'm left with my mother's alma mater: U of H. Now, it's not a bad school, but it's not where I want to go. Where is it that I want to go you ask? Why that would be Baylor University in Waco, Texas. You'd say, "No problem, that's in Texas. It follows the rules." Does it? Does it really? No, it doesn't. It's a private school. And private schools are considered to be out of the question. But Baylor is where I need to be. As of right now, I want to do something in the medical field, preferably the surgical field. I'd like to be a neurosurgeon. And if I have to stay in Texas for my colleging (oh yes, it's a word), I need to go to Baylor. Baylor is obviously the best institution for the field I'd like to pursue. All that I need to do is convince my parents. In order to do this, I have to add a new... oh curses I missed 11:11 by one minute... subject to my to-do list: write an essay explaining why I need to go to Baylor. I mean, I've got all summer. It'll be great. I'm going to make it into a big project and I'll have visual aids and everything. It'll be great. They'd have to let me go then. Right?

      How is it that I'm so bored right now? I have the entire internet at my fingertips, and yet I'm capable of boredom nonetheless. I was able to keep entertained for about 45 minutes reading short stories by Ross and his friend Phillip. Alas, the short story flow has ceased and I am left with no form of stimulation. Of course, I can always turn to my old fried Food. Oh, wow, I eat way too much. If I keep this up, by the end of the summer I'll have gained like 20 pounds. I don't like being fat. I was fat a few years ago. Well, not exactly fat, but pudgy. Pudgy Pudgy Pudgy. I'd hate myself so much if i were fat. I used to be horribly afraid of fat people. It's amazing how most of my fears, past and present, have to do with people. I don't understand how I'm afraid, but I am. I feel really bad about it, but it's not like I choose to be afraid of it. I have like the weirdest fears ever. If anyone can think of anything their afraid of that's stranger than old people, let me know so I won't feel so weird. The cats are fighting. It's funny because they'll be clawing at each other, then turn to run and smack right into a cabinet or something. Then every few minutes they take a break to lick themselves, which I find rather amusing as well. You know what I haven't had in a really long time? A Chicken Burger. I should really get me one of those. If only I had money... OK, now the cat fighting is getting kind of annoying. I mean, them running into things can only be amusing for so long. We're going to try to do the garage sale this weekend, but according to my fkoibn RFBG['P  Gah! cat on the keyboard... anyway... according to my father it's supposed to rain this weekend. So I'm not sure that the garage sale will actually happen. I hope it does. I just want it to go away.

      I had an awesome time at the beach and bowling alley yesterday. I still feel really bad about promising Austin I'd take him to the Rec Center and coming up short of that promise. I think he's fine, though. I'm going to be away from the house for a couple of days, depending on my mother. The whole family is going to be staying the weekend at the Bayou House, since it's Father's Day weekend. It makes my dad happy when we all go there, so my mom has decided to make us all go, even though the only one of us that actually likes it there is Austin. I always get sick when I go there. It might have something to do with the air, but I could be wrong. I could just be allergic to being away from the computer. It's going to be really weird because it'll be the first time all summer I haven't been on the computer at night. There's nothing to do there. I'll probably spend my time laying out in the sun or painting one of the rooms. A project I started Thursday, but have failed to finish. I'll miss the lot of you. Miss me, too.

      OK, so Jared wasn't mad at me, and he's not a failure. He was just busy with church stuff. That's a pretty good reason to not respond. It kind of would have been nice if he had though.

      I've been away from the blog for a couple of days, but there have been a couple developments. First, I've discovered I like Ross. I've also discovered that Jared is upset with me or something. He's kind of the person that I always complain to and he makes me feel better about situations, but he didn't make me feel better about a problem that I was having earlier this week. I sent him an e-mail about a hypothetical situation (the one I explained to Ross), but it's been three days and he hasn't responded. Also, I haven't talked to him since, I'm pretty sure, the same day I sent him the e-mail. I always talk to Jared and all the sudden he doesn't want to talk to me? What's up with that? All I asked for was a little help. Alas, I solved my own problem anyway and things are looking OK. I'm getting a haircut tomorrow. Finally. I didn't go to take senior pictures today because I need one. Right now my hair is all one length and it's really boring, and I'm finally going to get one. I sure hope it's not ugly, because I don't like to look ugly.

      Today was spent, beginning-wise, at church. There was a mission trip meeting. Then when I finally came home, Rachel found another roach. Like the 6 yesterday weren't enough. Dear Lord that was horrible. My number one fear is roaches. I nearly had an anxiety attack trying to kill three of them yesterday; Rachel killed the other three. So when the seventh one appeared today, neither of us were up to killing it. I was talking to Ross online and he jokingly volunteered to come over here and kill it, so I took him up on it. I went to his house and picked him up so he could kill it, but when he got here the roach had been scared away be Eeeevil Tristan the Canadian. Stupid Canadian. So I just got Ross to pick up the roach corpses that Rachel and I had taken care of last night. Then Ross and I played video games and I discovered that I should really play more, because I'm not good anymore. Then we played Monopoly, but Ross had to forfeit because he needed to get home. I would have won though.

      Yesterday was Laura's birthday so she decided that we needed to go to the beach. Beachgoers included myself, Laura, Ashley, Lisa, and Melissa Ontiveros. We had a super fun time. First we drove around Lake Jackson for like an hour going to people's houses and collecting stuff, so we got to the beach at like 3:15. We swam around for a while and then these three guys came. Only one was moderately attractive, until I glanced over and watched him pull up his boxers, but pull down his pants. Then I decided he's weird. They asked us if we wanted to go sailing with them, but they didn't even have a sailboat. It was one of those blowup boats that you use in swimming pools. So I also decided they were lame. Who asks someone to go sailing if you don't have access to a sailboat? They finally kind of drifted away from us, but came back to say goodbye when it was time to leave. We went back to the cars because we felt like we should be leaving too and then it happened. We were just standing there, minding our own business, when some black guy in a silver passenger vehicle drove up, stopped and hung his head and gold-plated teeth out the window and yelled "I just want y'all to know y'all all fine. Y'all all fine." We figured it was probably a really good time to go and started to get into the cars. His two black buddies then drove up, stuck their heads out the window and asked us what we were doing later. We were saved by the sailboatless guys who revved their engine and sent the black guys away. It was very amusing though. I also fulfilled one of my life long dreams of building a tunnel, though it was crushed shortly thereafter when the sailboatless idiots threw a football at it. I was crushed. Next time, I'll just have to make it bigger and better.

      I've been thinking about all the upcoming expenses I'll be in need of covering and I'm thinking it's not going to work out. Looking at my list of needs (well, not really needs so much as things that would make my life incredibly more convenient), I can tell that I'm pretty much screwed. The littler items I can do without until my birthday on September 13, though it would be preferred that I procure them as soon as is possible, but the larger, more essential things, I really really need. Number one, obviously, is a car. Cars are a very versatile part of any day: they can be used for transportational purposes, as a home, as a bed... I just really need a car. Number two is a cell phone. Now, I know that at times cell phones are extranuous and unnecessary, mostly for 12 year olds, but in my case, it's pretty much crucial. OK, so not crucial, but I'd love to have one. Story time:      Last year I celebrated my 17th birthday. It was a hot hot September day and my little brother Austin (who had turned 5 two days prior) was having his very first soccer game. Of course, I wanted to go and support him and all that good stuff, so I went. I wore jeans because I hadn't shaved and I knew I was going to be under the shade and the game wouldn't last for but and hour. I was a little inconvenienced by the heat, but I wasn't bothered. So,I watched as Austin's team got the crud kicked out of them. The game eventually ended and it was time to leave. Well, my boyfriend at the time,  urlLink Tim , had come to the game and brought my birthday present with him since he was unsure that he would attend the party I was having later. He had left it in the car so we went off to his car to get it. I told my mother "I'll be right back," and we started for the car. I got the present (a pretty pair of pink heart earrings and some ankle socks with little kitties on them, thanks Tim) and we said our goodbyes and I started off to my mother's vehicle. As I was walking away I saw Tim drive off. A0s I walked still further I saw my mother pulling out of her parking space. I assumed that she was just readying herself to leave, but as I continued on my path, she continued on hers and drove away. I watched her drive trying to convince myself that she wasn't leaving, but she didn't turn around. No, sir. I looked around for my grandparents' car because they had come, too, but they were gone as well. They left me. They had all left me. It was my birthday. I had no phone and there were no pay phones. No one was there to lend me their phone. Everyone had left me five miles from home on a hot September day: on my birthday. It was horrible. If I had had a phone I could have just called someone and they could have given me a ride, but I had no phone. So, I walked the five mile trek home in my blue jeans, carrying my box of birthday gifts.   A sad tale indeed. If only I were in possession of a cell phone, my pain would have been prevented. I think that's one of those things I'll cry about every time I think of it and forever be scarred by. That's not the only time I've been left or forgotten, either. There has been many a time when no one came to pick me up from school when I stayed late or from soccer practice when it finished early and all that. Poor me.

      And here I was worried that I wouldn't get to see it once. I have just returned from my third viewing of  urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . I saw it once on Friday, a second time today at 7:15, and a third today at 9:45. "My, you wasted no time between the last two times," one may be thinking. Yes, you are correct, for immediately following me second screening I ran into Talley and Rachel (Lucas' younger sister) at the movie theater. As I was driving away with my mother and 12 year old sister Elizabeth, I saw Talley's car driving into the parking lot. So, I told my mother and she followed the car and the passengers after their exit of said car. She was honking and flashing her brights on and off, but they were completely ignoring her. Finally Talley turned around and realized that we weren't some crazy stalker people like she had firstly presumed. She walked over to the car and told me to get out. Of course, I asked why, though I had a pretty good idea. She said that I was to go to the movie with them. Then, I asked which movie they were intent on viewing, and Talley replied that the movie in question was none other than Harry Potter. So, naturally I replied that I had just finished watching it, but she said something along the lines of "I don't care" and told me I was going to watch it anyway. So I did, thus upping my total viewings of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to three.

      I'd just like to start off by saying thank you to all the employees at Starplex for making this moment possible. The ticket seller, the popcorn butterer, but especially the ticket checker, for not stopping me from going into the Harry Potter theater and forcing me to see The Day After Tomorrow again. It started like any normal movie swapping, we bought tickets for one movie, and arrived on time to see Harry Potter instead. Then, things became unusual. Instead of stopping us from walking into the wrong theater, the ticket tearer simply shrugged it off and continued ripping those tickets. Next, as we took our seats in the worst possible place: the very end of the very front row, we were surprised by the lack of security. Unlike the average Houston theater, Starplex Cinemas of Lake Jackson didn't have someone roaming up and down the aisles to make sure everyone had their ticket stubs. Strangely, we were undisturbed the entire time, and didn't even see someone checking people's tickets. So, thanks Starplex Cinemas. I couldn't have done it without you.

      What a failure this day has turned out to be. First of all, I didn't get to leave the house to pick up movies and tickets like I had planned and thus was thwarted in my effort to attend Harry Potter and escape the obese children. Then, when it came time to stuff my face with hotdogs, I was limited to three because the fat kids had to eat too. Psh. They could live without five hotdogs each. Then I talked to my friend Laura on MSN and she said she'd go with me to see Harry Potter since Talley, whom I had planned on attending the film with, had already seen it earlier in the day. So she went to pick up tickets for the 6:45 show, but they were sold out already, and so was the 7:15 showing. Then I talk to people and everyone and their mom has already seen it and they're all telling me how awesome it is, and all I can do is just sit there and feel sorry for myself. I guess I'll just see it tomorrow after the SATs. If I don't see it tomorrow, I'm going to be sad. Tear.

      Tomorrow is going to be a busy day. It's the day of my little sister Lizzie's birthday party, thus I am flogged with chores. I shall perform as usual and disregard my assigned chores and do whatever I feel like. So, the plans for tomorrow are as follows: 1. Wake up around 10. 2. Think about cleaning the bathroom and the hall, but eat breakfast instead. 3. Drive to Blockbuster and pick up some movies for her fat friends to watch at the sleepover. Included will be: Donnie Darko, and whatever the heck Lizzie wants 4. Swing by the movie theater and see if I can pick up a ticket or two to the new Harry Potter movie because I'm a nerd. 5. Decorate the house, because, though a chore, I enjoy it. 6. Go swimming with Lizzie to get her used to jumping off the rope swing. 7. Think about cleaning the bathroom and hall again, but eat lunch instead. 8. Tell Lizzie she needs to hurry up and clean the bathroom and hall before her friends get here. 9. Lizzie's friends start arriving and I watch Donnie Darko while the fatties swim in the lake. 10. Chubby people come inside and I leave to watch Harry Potter so that I don't get the fat disease. 11. Go back to the house so I can stuff my face with hotdogs and pray that I don't get the fat disease from the infected children. 12. Rest up for SATs Saturday morning. Yippy.

      I had a dream last night that Lucas read my blog and thought that I had said I hate him in one or some of the posts, not actually came out and said it, but implied it. So when I woke up, I felt really horrible. I spent today reading through all of my posts making sure I didn't allude to a hatred of any kind toward Lucas or anybody else. I just want everyone to know that I don't hate anybody, regardless of how angry I seem to get. Sure, I used to hate my sister Rachel, but I realize that she's probably the way she is because of a hormone problem or something. She's probably really depressed and I don't blame her. I mean, she IS going out with Scott Lord, but I digress and lie. Scott's not that bad, he's just boring, and it really doesn't matter if he reads this because he already knows that's what I think. I've decided they probably mesh so well because Rachel's always talking and talking and talking and Scott never says anything. So Scott doesn't care that she's infinitely gabbing, as long as he doesn't have to say anything. So anyway, I just want to let it be known that I don't hate anyone, no matter how raged I appear to get.

      At least I can always find comfort in the distruction of another human being, especially if that other human being is Lucas. I totally annihilated Lucas at Monopoly. It was excellent, and good medecine. The only thing was having to look at him the whole time. I'm really confused about the whole thing. It's hard to decide whether or not I still like him. On the one hand, all I'm hearing from people is that he wasn't good enough, I was too good for him, I'm too pretty for him, I can do much better, blah blah blah, and all that gets me thinking that maybe they're right. I mean there wasn't really anything fantastic about him, other than the fact that he's the nicest guy I've ever met. Well, he was at first. Then on the other hand, he's Lucas. However, talking to Ross has made me realize that because of his lame reasons for dumping me, he wouldn't exactly be a very commited husband, so there's really no reason for me to date him ever. After all, the whole purpose of dating is to find the person that you want to spend the rest of your life with, and why would I want to spend the rest of my life with someone who can't even come up with good reasons to break up with me? I sure hope that made sense.

      Well, here it is: le premier de juin; what I am considering the start of my summer and the start of my getting over Lucas, and I have to say it started out pretty well. Last night, well, early this morning, at like 1 I took my sister Rachel, her "best friend" as I am told to refer to her as, Sarah, and a guy named Ross (who is friend to all of us) house wrapping. It was Rachel and Sarah's first time house wrapping. It was hysterical to watch fifteen-year-old Rachel stand there mumbling to herself about how she felt "so bad". Oh, I needed that. Ross is hilarious. Rachel and Sarah are really lucky he was there because they would have been complete failures on their own. I drove, since the two girls are 15 and Ross's license is suspended for 6 months after running into a guardrail and 80 mph and into a ditch. We parked sort of across the street at some Baptist Church/School and Ross went to check the house out because Rachel was paranoid that we were going to get caught. After he told us the coast was clear and they grabbed the toilet paper they went across the street and began the wrapping. I later joined them, but only as Supervisor, and I told them where to go and what to wrap. It was so funny watching Rachel and Sarah in all their confusion. When we ran out of toilet paper we tried to go back across the street and take off before we got caught, but a car came so we took off back to the house and hid. Then we tried to cross again, but another car came and we had to hide again. Once more we tried and again a car came. There must have been like 5 cars. When we finally got across and to the car Rachel remembered she left the flashlight. Who brings a flashlight house wrapping? Moron. So we went back and Rachel and Sarah hopped out of the car the search for the lost flashlight while Ross and I drove around the block trying not to look suspicious. Ross is a really cool guy.

      Here it is, the day before the mission trip has finally arrived. Wow, it's 11:00 and I haven't even started packing yet. That's fine, I can just sleep on the way up there I guess. Anyway, I'm going to be leaving tomorrow at 7:00 AM and arriving sometime next Saturday around 5:00 PM. Some people tell me I'll have a good time, and I really hope they're right. After all, it will be a whole week's worth of whatever it's going to end up being, and thus I pray for it to be enjoyable. Supposedly someone is going to be posting daily on the  urlLink Mission Trip Website . There's also a place for you to  urlLink contact me  while I'm on the mission, like send me a good luck e-mail or profess your undying love for me. Either way, I'd love to hear from you. I'll have my mother's cell phone and I just might call some of you during my absence. According to my sources I'll have about an hour every night to do so. Well, wish me luck. I shall miss the lot of you. Well, maybe not Trevor because he was mean to me today. I sure hope I didn't forget anything.

      Well, the campaign came and went: it came with promise, and went with failure. Of course, I do know that it is possible to beat it, and when I come home from the mission trip, it's going to happen. The Garage Sale also came and went, but I'm just plain glad it's over. Of course, we will eventually have to do something with all that stuff in the garage. It really wasn't that bad since I had company. Ross came, and so did Trevor who brought Mairead. I love Mairead, she's so cute and so sweet. She's even pretty clever. She drew a picture of me, which I'm going to do my best to get on the blog, all I have to do is find a scanner... coughRosscough. I went to see Ross's play today: Cinderella. It wasn't absolutely awful, but I really didn't like it. By the end of the performance I hoped a random stage light would come crashing down on Cinderella... actually it was more like as soon as she started to sing. Anyway, don't go see it. It's definitely not worth the ten dollars the evil ones will try to collect from you. Although, I did get a kick out of their inability to get the curtain down during the one of the scene changes.

      Well, I'm posting this early in the morning because I'm stupid and have decided to just not go to bed. Not the brightest idea since I've got garage sale stuff to do today, but oh well. I'm sure I'll survive. It's summer, I'll catch up on my sleep eventually. Speaking of which, I'm going to be pulling an all-nighter again sometime next week because of my Ocarina of Time Campaign, as I have chosen to dub it. So far I've gotten Talley and Ross to agree to help me. Talley's free to bring Lairen, the more the better. I asked Jared, but he'll have to "see how he's feeling" next week when we decide to do it. I may have asked Trevor, but I can't really remember. So Trevor, if I haven't asked you yet, feel free to join us. I'd invite Scott, but he told me he hated me today so I think I'll just not do that. Then I could invite Sarah Williams, but I don't know if she'll contribute as much as I'd like. Either way, I've already recruited Rachel to be in charge of refreshments and all the random things we need. I guess she's kind of the go-pher. I'm really hoping this works out well. I have to talk to everyone and figure out what day would be the most opportune to take on the task, and I still have to ask my mother when it's OK. Hopefully I'll be able to pick a day in which my father's out of town allowing my companions and me to play downstairs in the living room. Well, wish me luck on my endeavor.

       urlLink     This is my little sister Elizabeth. She's 12. This is her wearing my shirt and jacket... both of which I'd like back sometime soon. She's really strange and has horrible taste in friends, of course, it's not like she has much choice. She goes to a parochial school and the friends are slim-pickings. Well, I say slim, but they're all really fat. Poor chubby kids.

       urlLink     This is Jay. He has his own category because he's Jay. I remember my sophomore year he was in my Algebra 2 class. Talley and I never felt like doing our homework so we would so something stupid like play MASH and we would put Jay down in every category. It had to say something about Jay. Husband: Jay... Car: Jay... Honeymoon: Jay's house... Pet: Jay... good times. The hand pointing to his head belongs to Tim.

       urlLink     This here bes Ross; friend of me and all woodland creatures. Ross is really cool. You should worship him.   urlLink     This here bes Jared. He's not quite as cool as Ross, but he's way up there. He's really nice, too.   urlLink     This one is Trevor. Sure he looks like a ten year old stoner to some, but he's actually 16 and not on drugs. He's cool most of the time, but sometimes he can be a jerk. He's also Canadian, and for that we mock him, but it's all in good fun. I don't have anything against Canada... or do I?

       urlLink      This is Ex-Boyfriend Number 1, Tim. He's a little out there. We suspect he has a few screws loose. Tim and I went out for nearly eight months, starting in April of 2003, ending in December 2003. We broke up because I felt like we were only friends. He never seemed too interested and in the last couple of months he stopped asking me to do things with him. We pretty much only talked at school and he always seemed to have his mind on other things. So, it really seemed like there was no romantic interest, I mean, he never even kissed me; he never tried to kiss me. EIGHT MONTHS! Sheesh.

       urlLink     Enter Ex-Boyfriend Number 2: Lucas. Lucas and I met by way of Talley and got to know each other via the internet. After Tim and I broke up Lucas and I went out, and then went out again, and again. Though we never officially said we were an item, everyone started to call me Lucas' girlfriend and Lucas my boyfriend, so we just decided not to correct them anymore. We went out from December 2003 to the end of May 2004, so that's a good... five and a half months. Lucas is talked about on the main page so you can check out what happened to this relationship there. Check the posts for May 2004.

       urlLink     This picture was taken outside of Talley's house on Prom Night: April 17, 2003. Twas Junior Year for the lot of us, excluding Sophomore Robert. The boys all decided to wear Zoot Suits and Fedoras. We nerds had a good time at the Italian Restaurant pretending to be Mafia members.  In order of appearance: Julie, Lucas, Jared, Katherine, Talley, Robert  Julie: That's me. Lucas: My date - we were still going out at the time of this photo. Jared: Lucas' best friend since like 6th grade. Katherine: My old best friend from back in 8th grade, we had some fallings out, I'm not really sure what happened, but we're fine now. We hooked Jared and Kat up because they both wanted to go, but neither had dates. They agreed to go with each other and they went in our group, of course. Talley: My best friend, duh.  Robert: Talley's date. He had a thing for Talley, but I'm not sure that he still does. Talley had an on and off thing for him, so she asked him to prom because I wanted her to go. Thanks Talley.
