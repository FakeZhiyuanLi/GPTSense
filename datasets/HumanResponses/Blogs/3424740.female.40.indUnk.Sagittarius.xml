      In order to successfully complete the needed requirements to graduate from the International Project Management Program I have accepted a 2 month internship in the exciting metropolis of Winnipeg.... yes, that's right, Winnipeg Manitoba.  Don't laugh!  I've always said I'll go anywhere I haven't been and I've even been heard saying that I'd go to Winnipeg if I found a cheap flight.  Now I get to go somewhere I haven't been  and  I don't have to pay the airfare!  But once again I'm experiencing that you must be careful what you ask for... I must remember to dream big and boldly so that I may be drenched in the stuff of my dreams, not just taste.  I will start the internship with the Canadian Foodgrains Bank in September.  Amongst other things, I have been tasked with conducting a literature review of the current key documents on HIV/AIDS and food aid and food security as well as the current best practices and recommendations of other organizations.  I will then assist in revising, creating, and planning evaluation tools and practical guidelines to be used by Foodgrains Bank staff, members and their in-country partners to better address HIV/AIDS and food aid and food security. As this is one of my key areas of interest, it will be a good learning for me.  I am looking forward to it.  Happy Canada Day!

      Wherever I go, whatever I do, I constantly shout, "I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON!" just in case I'm on some hidden camera or something....                                                      You can't be too careful.

      My time in Toronto is almost at an end, only a couple of classes left at Humber College, and my experience with property ownership is over.  I loved Toronto - big, exciting and I know of the best breakfast diners and nacho plates in town.  Going back to school wasn't as scary as I had imagined it would be.  And that lovely, lovely piece of Anderson Estates is no longer mine.  Thank goodness - as it was seriously draining my bank account.  But I will miss it... the place I could come home to, shut the door, and feel safe.  It was me.  And it was my chance to experiment with the Principles of Martha Stewart (what!!?).  Anyway, it doesn't fit with my life going forward, so I had to let it go....  Next I am on a train to Trois-Pistole to study French for 5 weeks - so don't contact me unless you do so en francais as it will be against the rules for me to use English while I am there.  After that I am off to Boulder, Utah to attend the Boulder Outdoor Survival School (by Greyhound perhaps, 2 1/2 days from Montreal - yikes!).  This is something I have wanted to do for awhile - need to learn to be more of a Leaver than a Taker.    See the link to the right for info on the BOSS Hunter Gatherer course.

      Time to leave Quebec and journey to Utah.... by Greyhound... for almost 3 days.  But just think of the places I'll see...Albany, Cleveland, Toledo, Chicago, Ogallala, Denver. Visiting will have to be for another time as we just cruise on through.  Books, music, food... I'm more anxious about maintaining my sanity and surviving the journey to survival school, than survival school itself.
