      Hhhhmmm .. someone told me yesterday was the longest day.. seems about right .. i was up till 3:00 am reading a short story collection .. dun remember the authors name but guess he was a brit.. referred himself as Ruskin.. SOD chop suey is sort of soothing when you read .. these guys know their music.. take you high with fastest music you ever heard and bring you down slowly.. oh and while am reading i finished breaking into my buddy's comp.. tomorrow i will make him some recommendations ... i slept for 4 hours and up again with the aroma detergent .. the maid has come to wash the cloths.. how can some ppl get up so early.. it's inhuman... no one should get up so early... yawn .. i decided to take a lil nap and got up at 9:00 am .. was almost late again ... planning to go for some movie and beer tonight... hope it works out..

      Wow it's monday again. Means I gotta go to the office and will be able to get in contact with with humans... so what if I have to play three "meeting meeting" with the boss or might have to undergo an audit or will not be able to sleep off the wholeday.. I'll survive. The delights of the chilly cheese sandwitch ... I am surprised I got up early .. 8:40 am ... and for the record second time in this month I will be on time.. oh the shame of it... I can try and be late ...hhhmm let's see... nah forget it let's surprise 'em by being there on time .. beside there is nothing to do at home anyway.

      It's been a long time since I updated it. Have been busy lately. During my absence from here I happened to come across some interesting things. A friend dropped by who happened to be a healer. I asked her to help me out with this stress and body pain. She did just that and that too just by rubbing my fingers. It's a Korean healing technique she used which says our hand represents the body. The thumb symbolizes head, fingers symbolizes arms and legs and the palm is upper half of the body. It sounded strange at first but later after a lil discussion it made sense. The belief part came when a simple rubbing of finger tips made me relax as if I got a full body massage. Neat. In the evening some friends got together and were just talking and relaxing. Goodness .. the kinda jokes we cracked.. I won't be surprised if someone sues us for mental torture. The best part was when we went to gloubs and on the underwear section there was this one friendly girl. "May I help you sir??" she asked and got me a Boxer. The size of the thing was enough to contain three of me inside so i had to make it clear to her that I intended to wear it alone and not on sharing basis.  Thinking of going to office as well .. let's see how it goes.
