      We all have a place in life, and sometimes it is tough figuring out where we are.  I have always been an introvert which comes partially from moving around a lot when I was a young child.  Every 2-3 years we would pick up and move somewhere new, and I would start all over.  I loved actually going new places and seeing new things, and I was always able to make new friends - but over time it became difficult because I was not good at staying friends with the people I left behind.    I have kept a few close friends since high school/college, but those relationships have also become distant and much more casual.  Right now, I do not have any truly close female friends and I realize suddenly that I have become lonely for that.  My husband is and has been my best friend for nearly 20 years and I cherish that even when I sometimes take it for granted.  I do not know how to form that close connection to other people anymore.    It's kind of funny, but part of the reason we made our last move back to my homestate was because we had friends here already.  I'm just sad and disappointed that those friendships are not the same and that I don't have what I thought I did.

      New day, new train of thought.  Just saw an old friend today.  He has been friends with DH for almost 20 years and like many old friends we drift in and out of each other's lives.  He is the first of our close friends to go through a divorce and it has been tough to see.  As difficult as things sometimes get in my own marriage I just can't see ever calling it quits.  I just imagine that there is always a way to work things out for the better.  Anyway, this friend is already moving on into a new marriage soon and we wish him all of the best.

      Today is a strange day for me.  It is my husband's birthday (which is not the odd part) and he has been entertaining my son for the last hour without requesting my presence!  I have had time to read a few other blogs and websites that I follow - one of them being the wife of an old friend who writes about her grieving process after losing one of her 2.5 year old twins last summer.  I have admired her ability to express her emotions in such a public way... in this case over the internet.  One "nice" thing is the ability for people to check in on her and share in her pain unobtrusively.  People who are not comfortable with it do not have to read it and it gives her a safe way of expressing it --- she can mourn in a more private way.  I relate to her so well because I am also a mother of a single surviving triplet.    I look back on my own grieving process and it never goes away, although I have moved on for the most part.  I very rarely ever mention my own loss to people I am with in person anymore (It has been just over two years).  The first year was definitely the most emotional for me.  Now I am more detached.    Ahh....duty calls today.  It is time to go celebrate the birth of my DH and get the day moving!

      We had playgroup today.  I just love doing that.  The kids all run around and I get a little bit of adult/social interaction.  It is kind of funny watching the kids together.  My son is very much like his father and me in that we tend to hang back and listen/watch more than anything.  Most of the other kids run off together, but not my little one.  He is content staying near the adults and playing by himself.  I hope he will grow out of that phase and become more outgoing/social with his own age group..... but he is only 2, as I have to keep reminding myself.   These playdates have truly been my sanity savers on occasion.  & ds takes a LOOOONNNGGG nap afterwards :-)

      Somehow, I've had even less time for myself lately --- until today when I actually did not work in the store!  Right now I sit and wonder how I can be so incredibly self absorbed when I don't actually have the time to do much for myself.  Would I be LESS selfish if I had more time for me?  How do I make the balancing act work?  Other people manage.  Other people have spouses, children, and full lives and still have an abundance of time for themselves.

      I have a 2 year old and no time for a normal life.  My goal is to find time for myself again.  Daycare is NOT an option. . . any other ideas?  If ignorance is bliss, why aren't more people happy?

      Just getting by on a day-to-day basis right now.  I've been busy with my son's various daily activities this week and trying to think about the all important and murky business of finding a pre-school.  I don't even really know where to begin with that one.    Tomorrow we are blessedly unscheduled although I will probably run some errands.  We get busy again by Friday.  I'm up well past my bedtime now so it is difficult to think straight --- I'm missing out on any 'me' time again, although I have stayed clear of the store as much as possible.  DH is probably frustrated with that, but handling it well.    I did sign up for 30 free days at one of those 30 minute women's workout places.  I hear this one will even have a kids play area so I won't have that as an excuse anymore.  They are still under construction but should open in a few weeks.  Can't wait!

      I'm back from vacation in Maui.  It was AWESOME.  My 2 year old was a great kid on the planes - which was one of my biggest concerns about travelling since our last experience was the WORST time ever (picture the loudest, crying screaming child you have ever seen on a plane.  He scratched both of us in the face till we were bleeding and we were both crying when we got off). My DH also showed up out of the blue since he was supposed to be home watching the store.  His sister picked him up from the airport and he walked in to the condo and surprised the rest of us completely.  He stayed for 5 full days!!!  He is the life of the party around his family and brightens the whole group up.  It was a WONDERFUL surprise! It's now back to reality.  I had an incredibly spiritual moment the other day.  I stopped by the cemetary to visit the grave of my 2 babies, and as we were driving out I was listening to the radio.  The same old Then and Now Alternative station that I always listen to.  They were featuring an artist in the studio at the time - who I have never heard of.  She sang the most amazing, profound song for the moment ---- the first line was something like "when you're older you'll know you've got angels on your shoulder" and the rest of the song was about the greatness and power of Jesus.  It just seemed so appropriate for what I was feeling and especially poignant for my son with his 2 angel siblings looking after him.    Now, I'm not usually vocal about my spiritual/christian beliefs, but I most definitely believe in the power and greatness of God and this song just came out of nowhere sort of like a message reinforcing my beliefs.  If you listen, people, you can hear the message that God is out there.    Well, got to run.  There is snow that's going to break branches if I don't go out and rescue my trees!  Gotta love snowstorms in late April!

      So, I've been involved in a new computer game for about a week now.  It consumes my spare time and provides an avenue of escapism.  Tomorrow, DH and I are escaping for real.  We're leaving my DS with my parents for 2 whole nights and getting away just for ourselves.  Something we have not done since before the birth of my son.  Can't believe how long that has been!  (We have gone away a couple times for business - I think 3 nights each time - I cried each time I left)  I wonder if I'll cry tomorrow?  The good thing is that my son truly adores his grandparents and rarely if ever seems to miss me when I'm gone.  The other good thing is DH and I pretty desperately need some quality time alone together.  Our relationship has suffered in recent times so maybe this will get us fully back on track.  Here's hoping......

      I can't believe how fast time flies when you're not having fun.  Okay, maybe just a little fun.  I have had to work at the store nonstop for more than a week now.  DH has family in town and has been entertaining.  Then, he came down with a coughy cold thing and hasn't felt well enough.    Today we spent time training 4 new employees.  They all seem like great kids.  Tomorrow we have a big party coming in.    I'm ready for life to return to normal and just spend time taking care of my son.  Funny I say that because I am often looking for a break.  Now I get a break and I can't wait to spend time with him again.  He spent last night with Gma and Gpa.  Didn't even miss me!    DH and I did get out to our monthly neighborhood TGIF party.  It was a pretty good time.  We're very lucky to have great neighbors.    Anyway, I just say NO MORE WORK!  (I wish)

      Yesterday was a GREAT day.  DH and I desperately needed the quality time together and it turned out well.  We alternate years to plan our anniversary celebration and this year it was his turn.  He normally is a famous pre-planner, but this year he was a little more spontaneous.  He whisked me away to the mountains for a drive and a picnic.  The drive was beautiful, unfortunately the weather turned cold so we were not able to truly enjoy the great outdoors - but the gesture was wonderful.    On our way home we stopped off at my favorite furniture store to look at dining room sets.  Our current set is a well-loved hand me down from his family.  It originally was a wedding gift for his uncle at least 50 years ago and was beautifully re-finished and given to us when we got married.  The problem is that the chairs are rather fragile and we are afraid to have anyone sit in them.  Several of them have broken and been re-glued numerous times.    We both agree we need to replace them.    We now have the debate over what to replace them with.  Do we strictly go for function/durability and a very reasonable price or do we go with something that is also exquisite.  It is a little bit of a dilemma for us.  My problem is that I am pretty frugal which should indicate the cheaper set. However I sometimes wish we had 'nicer' things.  We both want this dining room set to be the last one we purchase during our lifetime so I'd hate to go with the cheaper one and regret it someday.  I'd also hate to go with the exquisite one and have something happen to it.  DH is afraid the nicer set would overwhelm our current dining room.  I disagree.  However, we also need something that will fit well into THE HOUSE we eventually settle into.  As he said, the cheaper table will work just fine for entertaining family, close friends and our current group of neighbors which is about all the entertaining we do.  The nicer set would be more appropriate if we ever get into the high society entertaining befitting a certain social status.  (gag)    Sorry, long discourse there that got off topic from the summary of our great day yesterday.  So, after browsing for furniture we came home and just relaxed / hung out.  It was incredibly restful.  Then, DH came upstairs at about 5:30 and changed into nice clothes and told me I had one hour to get dressed and ready to go out.  He left and came back with some incredible red roses while I got ready and we then went out for a lovely dinner at the Melting Pot (fondue).  We truly dined for more than two hours.  It was great because we talked about pretty much everything.  It was so nice.  We were actually back on the same page with each other and I was able to remember more of the things I like about this man who I have been married to for 12 years and exclusive with for a total of 18 years - which is nearly half my life.    As much as I love my son (with all my heart!) it was so nice being able to reconnect with my husband.

      It's been a loonnnggg slow morning.  Of course we woke up early.  Then I took my time reading the paper and finishing a book I was reading.  Then I talked to DS and his gparents.  They are having a wonderful time.  DS does not want to come home.  He gets so spoiled with them, but I suppose that is what gparents do.    DH gave me a lovely anniversary card and told me to be dressed casually and ready to go at 11:30 (which has now shifted to noon).  Don't know where we are going, but he likes doing surprises so I'll go with the flow.    Just my opinion, but I think relationships work best when one person is the planner and one person is the 'follower.'  I have tried to plan many things in the past, but feel thwarted in my efforts --- lack of appreciation, enthusiasm, etc.  Whereas DH LIKES to plan so I let him and try to go along with the appropriate enthusiasm.  It generally works unless there is something I really really want to do.    Another side note. I have added a sidebar to my browser which does a slideshow of all my digital photos.  I LOVE it.  The majority of the photos are of DS in his various stages of development - most of the pics are of him smiling and acting goofy.  I feel such joy/love/pride as I gaze at the images.  As I tell him frequently - he is my sunshine.  I saw a brief portion of a very disturbing show last night on one of the news channels about parents who hurt their children to get medical attention.  I was stunned that a parent could do what they caught these people doing on hidden cameras.  Literally smothering their children to the point of almost losing consciousness and blaming it on a medical problem.  I was horrified and so bothered that I literally could not watch the show.  Along with the fact that 2 newborn babies were found abandoned within a 24 hour period.  One of them was found dead and the other was on life support and not expected to pull through.  I just don't get it.  Especially when Colorado has passed a law which allows people to drop off 'unwanted' babies with no questions asked at fire stations/police stations or hospitals.  How could someone just toss a child into a trash can and leave it to die?  Maternal instinct or not - there is just a basic human decency.

      Spent all day at the store today with DH getting some work done.  DS is with the gparents for a few days, ostensibly for our anniversary - but we don't have much planned.    Hard to believe I have been married for 12 years tomorrow!  Most of those years were pretty good, and even though we have our rough spots I'm in it for the long run.  The 'D' word just is not in my vocabulary even when things get rough and I pray they are not in DH's either although some might say he'd have just cause.    Well, I've got more work to get done right now.

      Today feels like a very crazy day.  DH was sick all night with some stomach virus.  He had to drag himself out of bed so we could take one of our cars in for service.  DS and I brought him back home and left him to go out for breakfast and to do some marketing.    I had to rush over to the store to open it today and turn it over to one of our kids.  I was also busy on the phone trying to track down someone to take DH's place to go see the Cirque this afternoon.  Fortunately that was not a difficult ticket to give away and my dear friend will be joining me.    While I was at the store one of our other kids called in with a broken arm.  He has apparently fractured it in several places and may need orthopedic surgery --- very tough break (no pun intended).  So of course I also have to find coverage for him today and for the rest of the week.    Then our car place called and wanted to charge us $100 to rotate and align our tires which we just had done about 2 weeks ago after we had a flat replaced.  I think NOT.    My parents were able to come up early today to help out watching DS while I deal with some of the crazy stuff.  So they have taken him out to lunch, but I'm betting he'll be a big handful as he had a late breakfast and it is close to nap time.    So I'm taking a few minutes to breathe before I start calling to find a replacement for our injured employee because it is only noon and of course most of them are still sleeping!!!!!    All said, life is good today because I get to go see the Cirque!

      The rain just keeps coming......although we did wake up to sunshine this morning and slightly more positive forecast for the day.  More like normal with a chance of afternoon/evening thunderstorms.  Don't get me wrong, we NEED the precipitation desperately however sun is really good for the soul and it is so unusual to have this much rain at this time of year.    But enough about the weather.  Life is going on at its pace.  We had a pretty nice father's day.  We drove down to have brunch with Gma and Gpa and went for a walk in Garden of the Gods.  We did have pretty good weather all day Sunday (whoops - thought I was done with that topic).    My friend's news about her breast cancer is very optimistic although she is going to have a double mastectomy.  The surgeon assured her that she will be cured though.    We're going to see Cirque D'Soleil later this week and I'm looking forward to that.  It's always amazing.    & we just ordered new cell phones and a new Family plan.  I feel like we're moving one more step forward into the modern age.  I just don't want to become chained to the cell phone since we really only use our existing phone for rare occasions.    That's all for now!

      Just a quick post right now.  I have maybe 2 minutes.    The weather is on the cool side today so we're cancelling our playgroup outing to the water park.  Now I have to replan the day, but I'm thinking I will take DS to his first big movie experience.  I figure the earlier the better because the crowds should be down.  It should be fun.    I'm still saying a lot of prayers for my friend who has breast cancer.  They are still in the diagnosing stage - doing MRIs and biopsies, so I don't know much yet about her specific prognosis.  I'm very afraid and worried for her and wish I knew how to offer her more support.  She is surrounded by her sisters and mother for now, and I'm staying in touch.    & so the day begins....

      I called a friend yesterday and learned she has breast cancer.  I don't know how far it has progressed, what type specifically or what her prognosis is.  I'll see her tomorrow and offer whatever support I can.    For now, she is in my thoughts and prayers.

      Blogging is a funny thing for me.  It's hit and miss as to when I will have the time and motivation to Blog - hence the sporadic entries.  It's also funny that for as little time as I have it seems like my life is not that exciting.  I feel as though I lost my 'storytelling ability' along the way.    I think I used to have the ability....but years ago I found myself doing a lot more listening than talking.  Friends of mine can have a conversation or an event and repeat it back almost verbatim.  I find myself giving the abbreviated version.  e.g. I went to dinner with a few of the other playgroup moms tonight.  (true, by the way)  That would be about the extent of my description if asked, other than maybe 'it was nice and I had fun.'  Other people I know could then go into excruciating detail about the restaraunt, the food, the conversation, the clothes everyone was wearing, the nose ring in the waitress' ear, yada, yada, yada.    It is tough for me to do that.  Especially in verbal conversation, but even somewhat in the Blog.    I think this makes me exceptionally boring.  I sometimes wish I could be a more outgoing talker, but then sometimes I get bored by how inane some of the comments end up being when someone is an extroverted talker --- because a person can go too far.    Anyway, I really did get out tonight for moms' night out with a few of my friends.  The conversation got extremely personal and I shared more of myself than I normally do.  I was asked point blank if we are planning to get pregnant again, and I answered honestly.  Yes, when/if I lose weight to have a healthier pregnancy.  The conversation turned of course to my previous pregnancy which, while it gave me my incredibly wonderful son was also the most stressful roller coaster I have ever been on and not an exact experience I would like to repeat.  Yes, I would love to have more children.  No, I do look forward to going through all the shots, pills, appointments, etc.... that I went through last time.  Nor would I want to be on another 10.5 weeks of bedrest with several bouts of hospitalization and the expectation of having triplets which led to the devastation of losing two babies along the way... one during the pregnancy and one after the birth.    I don't know if I could survive another experience like that.    Wow, I guess I needed to get a lot off my chest after starting earlier tonight.    Anyway, overall it was a good night out.  I have missed having really close female friends these past few years and these particular women have reached out and been so supportive over the last few years --- it is just so difficult for me to open up.

      Today was a great day in my grand scheme of things.  I managed to get my workout in first thing.  After than my son and I went to a few garage sales and we picked up a little kids' picnic table for a song.  We stopped off at the cemetary for a few solitary moments (my son napped nearby in the car).  I managed not to cry there today.  I don't know why sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.    Then, we went to Home Depot and picked up a cart full of garden plants.  We came home and planted them.  He played inside and out most of the afternoon.    DH came home and we went out to dinner, and now at this early hour I have a few minutes to spend online.    I have also managed to not work in the store almost this entire week (except for an hour yesterday for a school tour).  Of course I have to go in tomorrow morning and take care of a few cakes, but then I should be good to go.    I also have to say that I love my sidebar in the browser.  I linked it to all of my photos and they play right next to me the whole time.  LOVE IT!  I'm just in a very good place right now, today.

      We just returned from a wedding in Canada.  It was a very interesting trip, to say the least.  In some ways it felt like life, as we know it, was somewhat turned upside down.    I now officially consider myself naive and maybe a little too trusting.  We had 2 big surprises over the weekend.  1st, this was a second wedding for our friend (not the big surprise).  The 'reveal' was in how long the relationship had been going on ---- apparently quite some time before it was officially acknowledged.  This is a little bit of a moral quandry for me because we are also well acquainted with the 'ex' of our friend and I'm a little saddened to learn there was plenty of cheating and lying going on in the former marriage.  & they wonder why the ex has been so upset and 'difficult?'  The 2nd was that a good friend of almost 20 years officially 'came out of the closet.'  Again, not a huge shock.....there had been some questions over the years, but I felt our friend would have been honest long before now.  But, I will cut him some slack....I think it was a very difficult thing for him and I don't think it changes who he is as the person we have known.  There was a great sense of relief, I think, on his part after he told us.    Anyway, it was a lot to process mentally and I'm still trying to figure out where I stand on the former issue.  If I ever have the chance to sit down and talk I will express my opinion but still try to maintain a friendship.  It's a tricky line to walk.

      Now a moment to discuss a bizarre coincidence in my life.  I mentioned that one of my closest friends has cancer.  When I met with her and a bunch of her friends for a prayer group prior to her surgery I noticed that she and her husband were wearing a matching pair of LIVESTRONG bracelets.  I did not ask her about them at the time.  I went to my father's retirement party yesterday and noticed he was wearing one of these bracelets.  Now, my father is NOT the type of person who would normally wear a bracelet so it especially stood out in my mind.   This afternoon I was checking out the webpage for a friend of mine who is a cancer survivor and is very active in the Lance Armstrong foundation and he had a link to the LAF for the LIVESTRONG bracelet.  urlLink http://www.nike.com/wearyellow/index_flash.html   I followed the link and herein lies the big coincidence.  The LIVESTRONG site features the stories and photos from 5 people.  One of the people featured, not too surprising to me, was the friend whose link I followed to reach the page.  The big shock is that I also know (used to know) the person right next to my friend.  Another odd fact is that both of these people used to live in my old college town - both now live in the same vicinity in another state - both obviously have strong ties to the LAF.     Now, this LIVESTRONG bracelet has only been around for a little over 1 month and I am just blown away by the fact that out of all the LAF supporters in the country - if not the world - that I would know 2 unrelated people.   It just seems very eerie to me --- and I'm trying to make sense of it all.  Do I blow it off as a complete coincidence or do I try to find a deeper meaning?  What would you do?

      So, these pictures are what I have been working on for the better part of the day!  This party was to celebrate the 1st birthday of a little boy.  The parents rented out the local pool, hired a clown for $200, purchased 80 individually decorated ice cream treats, had 2 HUGE cakes and goodness knows what else.  Can you say overkill?  But, I had fun making the ice cream desserts and I am proud of how they turned out.  They received raves from the crowd - so for us it was a good day.  More in a minute.....

       Man, the time is flying by.&nbsp; We survived the visit from SIL #1 + 2 kids and actually had a really good time.&nbsp; Now we're prepping for the visit from SIL #2 + 2 kids and her DH.&nbsp; This one will probably be more stressful because they are somewhat harder to please, but we'll try.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Then we have my Dad's retirement party with a visit from my brother and his family (2 kids + DW) and then we have our biggest catering party to date with 100 individually decorated ice cream treats.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  & THEN, maybe....just maybe I will actually disappear by myself for 2 whole nights for some completely selfish ME time.&nbsp; When I rush right back to reality with Mom's double knee replacement surgery that same day.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Not to mention I moved all the furniture out of my family room today and steam cleaned the carpets then completely rearranged the furniture when I put it back.&nbsp; DH even said he likes the change although it does make it more uncomfortable for tv viewing.&nbsp; But I think that may be a good thing because a) we may watch less of it or b) we will actually use the big screen tv w/ surround sound that we have in our basement (pardon me, home theater).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The cable guy showed up today unannounced because we have a non-responsive box in our home.&nbsp; Their diagnosis, not mine.&nbsp; Can you believe they came by without me calling and without an appointment.&nbsp; The good news is that I did not have to pay them anything.&nbsp; The bad news is that they changed how we have things hooked up and the picture quality suffers a little bit.&nbsp; DH would like to cut back to your bare bones basic cable --- which is actually okay with me since we really don't watch the 'digital' channels.&nbsp; Yet another way to save money.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  DS fell asleep at 7pm tonight.&nbsp; He missed a nap today.&nbsp; This is actually maybe a blessing in disguise since I now have a little bit of free time for myself tonight.&nbsp; The problem is that I am exhausted myself.&nbsp; DS came clamboring into our bed shortly after midnight last night and woke me out of one of the soundest sleeps I can recall being in almost ever.&nbsp; It was very surreal and I was dreaming at the time.&nbsp; His arrival was very disorienting and of course disruptive.&nbsp;   Did I mention that DS and I went to visit my friend who has breast cancer this week.&nbsp; She had her surgery on Monday - which by all reports went very well and it looks like they got everything.&nbsp; We are still praying for a speedy and complete recovery for her.&nbsp; She was in a great deal of pain on Wednesday, but was hanging in there pretty well considering.&nbsp; DS was a perfect angel in the hospital.&nbsp; I think he was having memories of his own hospitalization early this year and it may have frightened him a little bit.&nbsp; But he seemed to be okay with it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  THere is just so much going on right now.&nbsp; Hardly time to think, much less type in a blog but I miss it.&nbsp; The release of putting thoughts to letters/words.&nbsp; I'm still trying to figure out my perfect get away for next weekend although the timing is horrendous, the temptation to go is almost overwhelming.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I watched a video with DH tonight.&nbsp; It was a History Channel piece on the plane crash his father died in.&nbsp; We had some good conversation afterwards, but it was a little tough getting him to talk initially.&nbsp; He said one very nice thing to me....that if he were in the same position his mother was in then, he would talk a lot more about me to DS.&nbsp; That warmed my heart a little bit.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This whole relationship thing is just so tough sometimes.&nbsp; I have always known in my heart that my marriage is  till death parts us.&nbsp;  Lately though things have been so strained between us....I never imagined it could get as difficult as it has.&nbsp; It was just so nice to see signs that reinforce that DH is also in this for the long haul.&nbsp; I guess I was only having doubts because of what happened with our friends who recently divorced and have since remarried other people.&nbsp; Just seeing that some people treat marriage so casually sends the message that you never know what your partner may or may not be thinking.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway, even though we have our own MAJOR issues to work through I sincerely believe we will find a way to get through and find ourselves back in a better place with each other.&nbsp; I will keep on trying.  &nbsp;

      I haven't had much time to post lately.  We're back in the swing of things with DS taking up the majority of my time and the store taking up much of the rest of it.    Today, mercifully DS is down for a long nap in the high heat.  We're gearing up for a particularly busy week and weekend.  My SIL is coming to town with her 2 youngest girls.  We have a grand opening celebration at the center where our store is on Saturday.  We have cakes and parties to plan for, employee reviews to finish and the list goes on and on.    I did read the DaVinci Code last week.  I found some of its notions intriguing and not out of the realm of possibility with regard to the Church squashing the feminine deity, so to speak.  Not that I necessarily believe Mary Magdalene was the female equivalent of Jesus - but I certainly believe the church of antiquity had notorious political agendas which were not Godly by nature.  & I don't believe that sexual orgies are a holy form of worship.  Other than that....clearly the book was written as a piece of fiction and certain literary licenses were taken so I read it as a novel - not as a factual piece on any par with the Bible.  Enough of my opinion on that topic for now.   Work awaits me and I will try to wade through some of it.  Thank goodness I am pretty much my own boss these days!

      Okay, it is a yucky morbid day today.  I was driving home with my son in the car and we were in a double left turn lane.  The car next to us on the left turned on the wrong side of the median into oncoming traffic.  Fortunately - she did not get hit and she was in a big SUV so she drove right back over the curb to get into the proper lane.  It was a near miss.  That shook me a little bit.    So I drive about one more block and there are a bunch of police cars in a parking lot with crime scene tape blocking off a small field.  I glance over and see a dead man lying face down in the field.  He was most definitely dead.  I can only assume it was not natural causes (although maybe he could have had a heart attack or something and stumbled off into the field?)  The image is burned into my brain.  I have never seen a dead body like that before (from non-natural causes).

      Well, we made it through the 4th of July!  Business was very slow at the store which seems odd and I'm almost hoping that continues through the week since DH has gone off to Vegas for 4 days.  We just sold one of our cars to a friend who lives in Calif. and they are meeting in Vegas to complete the sale and have a little fun.    I'm a little stressed about handling the store and DS and just the everyday stuff by myself but what choice do I have?    I'm also not quite sure where my mind is this morning.  I'm in kind of a fog and can't organize any of my thoughts.  Ever have those days?

      I keep feeling as though something is out of sync but I can't put my finger on it.  My mother's recovery is progressing well, my friend is doing well in her fight against breast cancer, my immediate family is in good health.  I just can't figure out what is not right in my world right now.  This sense of impending doom almost.   I had a thought today that I could be manic / depressive but I don't think that is the problem.  I feel like I am functioning okay and can still find joy in life.  In fact, since my 'alone' time of a few weeks ago I have been feeling somewhat rejuvenated and refreshed with life.  I just can't shake the feeling that something is off........

      Still in the swing of things.  It almost feels like fall already which is just WRONG since our summer never fully materialized weather wise.  I would think that our drought has got to be fully quenched for this summer because it seems like it has rained somewhere in our vicinity every day this summer.   I must say that fall weather does feel good though.  The slight coolness in the air just gives a little bit more energy to things.   My family went for a lovely hike/stroll this morning along one of our numerous local nearby trails.  I would like to make it a regular ritual and I often wonder why I don't because it is so easy and close and beneficial to all.   At the moment DS is quietly napping away for hopefully a LONG time since he was a little bit wearing while we were out running errands after our hike.  I am taking the time to catch up here and then will do some reading and chores if time permits - probably in that order.  I should also be planning more time to visit my friend who is dealing with her breast cancer and with mom and dad as mom recuperates from her bilateral knee replacement.  I have actually spent 2 nights at home now.  I'll give mom a call soon and will probably go back down there tomorrow.   & maybe over to my friend's this afternoon.  Her birthday is Thursday and I need to get her card in the mail.   I am just rambling now.  I guess I should be less esoteric here except I don't think anyone is actually reading my blog.  So it's okay to write solely for myself.  Along those lines I have decided to not share my blog with anyone I personally know.  I just wouldn't want to write anything unintentionally that might hurt their feelings - what would that gain?   Now I'm having trouble completing my thoughts so this is all for today.  Maybe I'll feel more literary another day.

      Well, I made it through another few hurdles, timewise.  My mom had her double knee replacement 2 days ago.  We drove down the day of surgery and spent time with her that afternoon/evening.  Then we drove back down last night and I spent the night with her so Dad could go home and get a good rest.   It's rather ironic, but Mom is a nurse at the hospital where she had her surgery and yet she is DEATHLY afraid of being left alone at the hospital because she is certain the nurses / caregivers there will kill her.  I think that is a very sad statement about nursing care in this country.  You would think that she would be 'wired into the system' and be able to get the very best care they have available in the hospital - but it doesn't quite work that way.  Granted I think she is somewhat phobic and paranoid without cause, but she has had some very questionable care while there.  Having been in the hospital quite a bit over the last 2 years - during my pregnancy and my son's RSV hospitalization I have seen some very dramatic differences in the quality of nursing skills.  With all that said, Mom is trying very hard to get released from the hospital ASAP which will leave my father as her primary caregiver at home.  I think that is a huge burden for him but he is a trooper and will do the best he can.  I am afraid that his best is often not good enough for mom - but they have managed pretty well for the 38 years they have been married.   The next few weeks will be busy with shuttling back and forth to visit mom and take care of DS and the store, etc, etc.   Gotta run!
