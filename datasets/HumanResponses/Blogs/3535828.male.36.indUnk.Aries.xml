      POSTAL INDUSTRY CONFERENCE Thursday 17th June  Pat O Hara opened conference. The first motion of the day was moved by the Postal Executive setting out our strategy for dealing with pay and working time. The strategy to include; -	Wide-ranging research of new targets for substantially higher basic pay.  -	The need for a new bargaining process to focus the benefits of progress. -	The defence of national pay bargaining  -	To link our policies on Working Time, shorter working week and maximisation of overtime rates. -	A communications approach that will engage the whole membership -	To increase understanding and early intervention into royal mail planning and financial processes. THIS WAS CARRIED UNAMINOUSLY  Conference agreed with South East 5 Branch that functional productivity schemes should supplement rather than be part of basic pay. Given the policy agreed (above) on pay a number of branches withdrew motions, including ours (1.19). Martin Cooper, Letters Section Secretary making his inaugural speech explained to conference that given headquarters assurances on involvement and policy we were prepared to withdraw.  The next motion was ours (Motion R) with Newcastle calling for the negotiation through 2005 pay round that all shift payments shall be fully pensionable, was accepted.  The next two motions carried (1.31 & Motion T) related to Quadrant and Parcelforce pay. Next up was Emergency Motion E4, relating to Logistic Solutions. The National Officer and several delegates including Steve Clarke (Area Distribution Rep) explained the problems with the current unfair pay structure. The motion said that if no satisfactory progress on an acceptable agreed approach is not reached by the end of June 2004 members in Logistics would be balloted for Industrial Action. After a significant and lengthy debate it was unanimously carried.   The next 2 motions (1.43 & 1.44) related to Postal Engineers allowances and interest free loans for RoMEC members to “take full advantage of the cost saving offered to purchase season travel tickets.”    The next motion (1.45) moved by Eastern Number 3 Branch (NR Postcode) called for a renegotiation of the Working Time Agreement because of its unfair/unlawful because Scheduled Attendances are not available to everybody. In a long debate the motion was carried.  1.47 was carried and said that any AG’s who meet the qualifying criteria for allowances are paid the full allowance. 1.48 was also carried which called for an increase in the Shetland Islands allowance due to the increased travelling. 1.49 also called for a re-negotiation of the Working Time Agreement.  1.51 from Newcastle was carried and called for a skills allowance for Revenue protection workers. 1.53 agreed that when part time workers perform Scheduled Attendances they should be entitled to paid breaks until they reach the 40 hours. 1.54 called for an allowance for 3.5 tonne drivers performing more than 2 hours up to a maximum of 6 pounds.  1.56 from South West Number 1was carried and called for an allowance for certified cycle mechanics. 1.58 was carried after a lengthy and stimulating debate. The motion called for a remuneration package for First Aiders. Given the breadth of possibilities HQ agreed that to engage the Employer.  Conference agreed that the decision by Royal Mail Group to introduce the “share in success” scheme without a formal agreement with the CWU is not in the best interests of the members. The schemes based on unagreed targets and provides no financial benefits for profit improvement is unfair.  1.71 by the Postal Executive called for a consultation document to provide a comprehensive Pension policy. Composite motion Y was carried after the case was made that the MTSF (2) Agreement discriminates against those between 60 & 65.  Conference closed at 1645.

      RULES REVISION CONFERENCE MONDAY 14TH June 	 Conference opened at 9 O’clock sharp and the first motion (64) calling for all future national briefings to be in the regions this was defeated. The next motion called for an increase in the branch rebate for retired members on the condition that they are properly organised this was carried.  The following motion was carried (67) this brings in an increase for the proportion of members money that goes to branches instead of HQ, but puts responsibility for new costs onto branches.  The next 4 motions were debated concerned the death benefit and honourarium, and not carried as the veto came back into play.  Motion 74 moved by union headquarters was carried and called on any branches with excess funds to be placed into a separate fund and any interest spent on “growing” the union. The next motion (75) re-established the trustees rule and was carried. The next motion renewed the members auditors rule and was carried.  Motions 78 and 79 surrounding national funds and planning these were agreed. There then followed a series of motions being vetoed by differing parts of the union and withdrawn.  Conference then reached motion 85, a motion that significantly set the tone of the conference. There has been a change imposed by headquarters and took away the ability of our Divisional Representatives to attend conferences in their own right instead of having to block a seat of somebody else within their branch. This issue has caused major discontent amongst postal branches after the Telecoms Engineers stopped the change last year using their veto causing much of the animosity that had been seen over the previous day and a half. So the motion was significant to the Branch and every postal branch. John Farnan Divisional Representative for our Anglia Division moved the motion and almost immediately made the point that either the different parts of the union must moved closer together, or move further apart. (All the delegates new how the Postal side felt this motion should be carried and tension was high). After significant speeches from the engineers and telecoms clerical constituencies the motion was carried, after Billy Hayes managed to get the NEC to change their opinion and instead made a supporting speech. In speaking Billy had read the runes and said that he hoped that this could be seen as a landmark moment as the union finally moved to be a single union. Motion 85 was carried. (Hurray)  The next significant motion (89) carried related only to the telecoms constituency, this was carried with no dissent. Motion 100 moved by HQ established clear rules in relation to Industrial action and the necessary procedures, this was carried.     Peace had formally broken out and each motion was progressed for the betterment of the whole union. Conference closed with Pat O Hara the President thanking everybody for making the difficult decisions that had been taken and thanked delegates for the comradely way debate had bettered the union.

      Well I'm updating the site from conference venue, so I'm not doing my usual midnight updates.  Very eye opening & interesting debates.  John, Dave ward sends his regards. ;-]  RULES REVISION CONFERENCE SUNDAY 13TH June  Conference opened with the National President Pat O’Hara welcoming delegates and hoping that in our 10th Anniversary Conference we could all take this union forward for the betterment of all members whether that be Postal or Telecoms and that old animosity could be put behind us.  Conference then took nearly 2 and half hours to agree anything as the different voting blocks (constituencies) vetoed motions all over the place leaving a bitter taste in many a mouth.  When everybody agreed (motion 16) it was to reduce the size of the National Executive by half and to remove the votes of all Officers, thus giving policy making authority only to annually elected.  Conference was still in danger of turning into a chaotic disaster after another 3 motions in a row were vetoed.  Motion 22 concerned the national industrial structure and was moved by HQ themselves. It also takes the vote’s away form the Officers (see above). As a consequence the Branch motion (26) was not heard.  Motion 24 concerned the election procedures for retired member to the advisory committee. Conference broke for lunch and it was agreed that enough time had been spent discussing Headquarters and that the Branches wished to move to a less “political” and that the agenda should be changed to discuss members business and branch structures in order to be more constructive. Motions 104, 105 and 107 were carried, they related to membership services.  Conference then discussed branches and local structures. Motions 35, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 were all carried; by this time conference was ahead of time and much less fractious. Conference then moved onto discussing finance. Motion 53 was the only motion carried out of the next 10. This also included the branch motion to redefine the way in which the rebate is pay to the branches by CWU HQ, the motion was vetoed by one of the voting blocks, the motion was moved by Nobby Clark on behalf of the branch   Conference finished after a good deal of debating and many delegates were pleased that so much business had been got through.

      Every year The Communication Workers Union holds conference.  This year the format of conference is different, in that it is a 'motions' based conference.  This year the delegation from our branch (eastern 5)of the CWU includes the branch editor.  For the past couple of years our branch website has been entered into the branch website competition & has failed to even get a mention.  So this year I'm going to conference (where the winner of the competition is announced) to demand that our 'soon to be award winning' website gets the recognition it deserves.
