      Once in a while, you hear of a movie and you think, "Hmm, that might be good." You also think that it has the potential to be really horrible. You read a couple reviews and you ask around a bit, but no one's seen it because it's new and low budget or foreign or something. You decide, "What the hell, I'm going to see it!" You take your chances and are rewarded with 90 minutes so rewarding that you feel like you've been punched in the stomach - but in a good way. Yeah.  urlLink The Garden State  - see it ASAP. I don't want to have to call the movie theater and get the times for you!

      Thursday night is my first Open House with the Parents night. We see each class for only 8 minutes, and that's all of NOTHING, so it's no big deal. But to be perfectly honest, it makes me freak out when I think about it. Just me and the parents. Scary.  I got my first nasty note back from a parent today. I know and KNEW I was totally in the right on the whole situation, which incidently was not that big of a deal. But it sort of bothered me. Parents. I hate them.   It'll also just be wierd to be on the other side of the Open House Night. The side that never got to go. Every year when my mom and dad went to my open houses, I'd always wait up for them to come home and ask them all about what they thought of my teachers. Now, I'm the one everyone is coming to meet.   Being on the other side is sort of surreal. Like during the televised morning announcements. These kids LIVE for the morning announcements. If I forget to turn on the TV, they're all like, "What about morning announcements, Ms. Grace?" I remember getting all excited for that sort of thing too. It was so exciting to see that eighth grader or whatever get up and bumble over words and crack silly jokes. But let me tell you, those morning announcements are just a big fat plate of nothing. But hey, for sixth graders, it's the little things, I guess.  The little things like, being impressed that I can name all the presidents of the United States in order. Impressed that I know how to tell the difference between a crocodile and an aligator. Impressed by my 10 minute contour line drawing of my shoe. It's all about the respect, guys. And I'm earning it inch by inch.   I think that this grade might just be perfect for me. I think you push me up to eighth graders and they'd think I was the biggest, squarest, lamest, jerk of a teacher ever.   Too bad that I don't think they're parents will be impressed by that sort of thing. Oh well, I'll do what I can.

      When my dad calls my cell phone and I don't answer, he doesn't leave a message, but he calls 4 MORE TIMES?! WTF, Dad? This has been especially irksome this week since my mom has been out of town and he needs someone to herd. At least that's my theory. I just can't tell you how annoying it is to check your "Missed Calls" and they're all from "Daddy Cell". All. Of. Them.

      If someone could please tell me what could possibly feel better than...  1) Waking up with a little doggy snuggling next to you under the covers.  2) Waking up refreshed, but early enough to get ready leisurely, have a cup of coffee and read the paper before heading off to start the day.  3) Hearing a kick ass homily at Mass by a man who seems to be a kick ass Franciscan.  4) Having wings and lemonade for lunch with an old college boyfriend. Having the wings be great, the conversation fun, and the taste in my mouth afterwards not feel spicy or nostalgic.  5) Going down to the mall to return a very "un-Gracie" dress which the ex-fiance gave me the weekend of my melt down when I realized that I could never, ever marry him, and finding out it was worth $69.99 at  urlLink THIS  store (which comes close to heaven).  6) Proceeding to buy a perfect skirt and cute necklace and earrings for some occasion that has not popped up yet, but WILL most definitely pop up eventually.  7) And only having to spend $14.99 in addition to the store credit of the "un-Gracie" dress.  8) Getting up the guts to call a tiny crush to tell him there's no news on the Bible study (just an excuse) and maybe he'd like to get coffee with me tonight before I head back up home. No coffee tonight, for he is en route from NYC after a wedding, but said he'd "definitely call me so we can do it."  ...they must be watching the sun set on the French Riviera while drinking drinks with limes in them along side  urlLink Audrey Tautou , Clark Gable, and of course Albert and Eleanor. And where Clark completely ignores everyone else and thinks you are the most stunning, smart and angelic creature in existence.  PS. Yes #1-8 happened all today. Boom!

      Even though I haven't seen a spot of rain today, Charlie, this is for you...  You made it possible for me to make a much needed trip to the bank.   You also made it possible for me to get my tire fixed with no hassles.  You also allowed me to stay up later and finish the book I've been reading.  You allowed me to NOT set the alarm last night before finally going to bed.  You were the reason I got to see Katie Couric in Athens this morning.  You are why I could crawl back into bed and sleep a little more.  You are the reason that when I finally did get up and showered and dressed, I could put on my flip flops and wear them for the rest of the day.  You are why I'm catching up on things that needed catching up on.  You are why I now have a 3-day weekend.  Thanks, Charlie, I owe you one.  PS. You are the reason one of my "holidays" will be made into a school day. But I won't hold that against you right now.

      The first day of school from a teacher's perspective was so different than it was back when I was in sixth grade. I remember my first day of sixth grade. It was also my first day of private school. For five years I attended your average public elementary school. I had friends. I rode the bus. I sang in the choir, played the hand bells and was in art club. I even did a stint as a "square dancer" which was the highest notch on the elementary school dancing hierarchy, with "folk dancers" following behind.   A new school, a private school and my first day in what we call "Middle School". It was also my first day in uniforms. We had PE uniforms too, that you had to change into in a teacher's classroom. Boys and girls were segregated for PE, which seemed strange at first, but I actually ended up liking.   The girls were nice and I made friends. But they didn't associate much with the boys. I wasn't a big dater back when I was 10 years old or anything, but this struck me as bizarre. Every birthday party in 5th grade was of the boy-girl nature with the likes of Roger Rabbit, the Cabbage Patch, and of course, everyone's favorite Running Man. There might even be a slow dance to Timmy T, with more than enough room for the Holy Spirit, Father and Son. Back in fifth grade, they also played spin the bottle, though I was always one of the outsiders on that affair. I distinctly remember totally relating to DJ's boy-girl birthday party on Full House. Come on guys, 10 years old, OK?  So sixth grade brought things other changes other than uniforms and a regression in male/female relationships. It also brought changing classes. I don't remember that as being much of a big deal. But I do remember that keeping track of all the teacher's books, folders, homework and one locker combination to be a challenge. Sixth grade meant organizing.   When I got the the first day of school as a first year teacher in a sixth grade art classroom, no, I really wasn't nervous. I had it all planned out. I knew what I was doing. I finished student teaching with minimal amounts of tears and flying colors. 6 classes of sixth graders. Piece of cake.   What my secret weapon was, was knowing that they were more scared than I was on my first day of teacher pre-planning. They were terrified. They were small. One boy was afraid to TALK.   I heard talk of the first day of school back in teacher preparation classes. "You'll go straight home and go to bed and not wake up until the next morning!" "You'll never be so tired as you are your first year!" "The first year, man are you in for it!"  I don't make light of the situation, or exaggerate my classroom management abilities.   I'm too nice. I give in. When I asked that they bring in their "Welcome Letters" signed by their parents TOMORROW "or else it's a ZERO", I knew that I wouldn't be giving out any zeros the next day. I laugh at the bad kids inside. I think about which boys I would fall in love with, if I were in sixth grade. When a boy farted in my class, I wasn't sure what I should do. I say things like "cool". And "awesome". And "dude".  I went into this school taking the don't-smile-before-Christmas attitude. I wanted the kids to behave. I don't want chaos to erupt in 4 weeks. I want them to make great art. But on the first day, when I heard a student tell his friend that "Middle school is really hard because the teacher's are so STRICT!" and I was stupid enough to as, "Like ME?!", he said, "NO, you're nice!"   Yeah, I suppose that's usually a compliment. But I was so excited at the fact that I might be STRICT, it was crushing to be called NICE. I wasn't going for NICE. Maybe it's a good thing I was shooting for strict because if I had shot any lower, I would have hit SOFT or EASY or something much worse.   By the third day of school, I was kicking some ass and taking names. I haven't given out a referral. Yet. And I haven't given out any zeros. But tomorrow's the day. Tomorrow will mark one week down with many more to go!

      Enough of summer!  Summer officially ended 3 days ago. Work has commensed and Monday will be exciting and terrifying.  I'm ready for it all to begin. I about a month off and it was a nice month of pools, beaches, apartment fixing and family time. Enough of that, I'm ready to start my career.   My room is pretty much ready. My lesson plans are pretty much ready. And I'm ready to have a nice relaxing weekend with a friend's family and babysit her baby while they party at a wedding.

      This summer has officially one day left in it for me. One. Day. Left.  Started out perhaps the rockiest summer of my life. Is ending smoothly. I think it may be the calm before the storm because this next year is going to be a ride. Let's just hope a safe and theraputic one.  Some things I learned this summer are...  My parents rule. My friends rock. When I get married, I will not have assigned seating, my mother do all the work, a stressful experience. What happens in Key West, stays in Key West. Just because someone's 23 years old does not mean that she is above wetting her pants in public. Eating Harry Potter jelly beans with 10 year olds is fun. Coming back home is a blessing.  Weekly city auctions are better entertainment than VH1. There are things in life that keep me sane - I'll let you in on some of them as we go.  There's a short list, that is by no means complete. When I think, as I have this past weekend, about where I was 1 month ago...and 2 months ago, I shudder. I don't want to go back there again. I wish I could erase it from my memory. I guess there's no use in that though. Remembering bad things can be just as hard as remembering very good things.  But for now, I'll concentrate on that last day of summer. Enjoy it. Love it. Hold it. And do the same with the career and life that has begun. And give me the strength to kick some 6th grade ass.
