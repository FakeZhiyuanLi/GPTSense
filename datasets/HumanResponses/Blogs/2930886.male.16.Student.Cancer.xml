      I guess you guys know what neglect feals like. Well time to force myself into one of these huge pointless raves about nothing. Well todays topic, Je ne sais pas. I dont know i dont have much of interest to post, maybe track. I already broke one of my goal, in Javalin i have already thrown over 100 feet, actually my mark against Trumble was 111'2". I'm currently the best on Bunnell and Stratford high but chappy and that other kid havent thrown lately so I'm happy. Polish isnt bad, i just dont like it, its boring and i dont think i will use it, but on the bright side there are a cople of good looking people, and even the teachers look good, Jola wore a thong under her skirt, and it was so sheer you could see it. Lets see, I'm also working on a glider for a physics competition for school with me Constantinos and Jesse, really i am doing it to see his sister and flirt with her. Well i am also planning for the future, my classes for next year are scheudualed but i want to change them, and i want to see if i can get an intereship during the summer so i dont need to worry about work. And yes for all those wondering  it is 11 weeks and 1 day to my permit, which means 78 days till i have it, and 27 weeks till I can DRIVE.

      Well I'm to lazy to update regularly, and now that i hav some time i guess i will do some writing. Working on an essay right now, that i thought i did really well, and so did a few other people but i got a fucking C-! that annoys me, you know what else annoys me right now, that people who dont work dont do anything in track are throwing much better than me, Dan Parez, who has never thrown a shot in his life already is throwing 33, and im throwing like 28. Well i also broke 100 in Jav today which is good, but still pretty bad compared to everybody else

      Well Part one of what stress'es me in an attemp to get better at contorlling stress and what not. School in todays edition of stress. 1. English - Hate it because there is creativity involved and i dont do that creative stuff i dont write unless i have a guideline on how to or what to write. I also hate criticism, i dont know why but i just hate it, maybe because im being single out for sucking at something. I mean in discussions i make all these good points but thats the only time when i am allowed to discuss something when its talking about characters or something im no good.  2. Business Law - She just treats us like fucking idiots, i dont know what it is about her she doesnt realize that we are grwoing teenagers and will be ourselves, she doesnt fucking realize that, im a fucking genius in that class, i can do most of the things in that class much better than anyone and my average is a 102 i dont think i really care much anymore, and why doesnt she do anymore bonus things for points so i can get a higher grade. 3. Gym - No real complaints except that i couldnt get a girl friend unless my life depended on it. I mean i already do two varsity sports do i really need to do gym i mean honestly maybe those idiots in our class who dont putfoth any effort but i do. 4. US History - i mean i think she expects a bit much out of us but hey shes a bitch and that brings around my next pooint, my scheudual for next year i will never be able to take all the classes i want to take, shit i gotta find a way around this to open up some slots. 5.  Chemistry - No complaints, just a it too much memorazation 6. French 3 - Damn this class i mean i want to take it next year but i dont think i will, it is hard and the teacher even though she explains it is a bit of a random character, she just does all this shit that is random. I dont know i want to get into a good college and everything but is the extra year worth verse what i can possibly take in its place. 7. Algebra 2 - Easy class not to tough comparatively speaking, and fun and bring about my oher point i cant talk to girls im just a NERD. 8. Polish - Im so stupid how can i notdo well in the class but i am and in a class of all girls and i must seem weir, well i am, but then again i am better than all them at most of this and probably did better than all of them once again. I saw my last quiz grade was a 64 and with a curve assuming grades arent that much better it will be an A.   This rave has had a secondary purpose it was to see how many words i could type, so i could see if i had potential to do nanowrite month, i wonder if i could wreite that 50,000 words, and guess what next year, a couple of days after it starts i could actually go to a writing party. Fun. Well lets see what other topics i can talk about as relating to stress, one definately could be home, track, friends, etc... i dont know i definately will post again later

      Well I am mad for several reasons, first I accidentally destroyed my blog, well quick thinking saved it somewhat. I have some time to update, lets see CAPT sucks ass so much! ! Track in the rain, I keep trying to talk to Rachel but alas, nerd like me can't have someone like that, plus on top of being a senior and a good looking one I believe her mentioning something about a boy friend I hope not. Well there's Carlie, a junior, still out of my league because she's a genius, 2nd in her class, but I don't think that she had a boy friend, but then again she probably wont be interested in me.  There's Jane a freshman that likes me, I think I stand a better chance with Meghan, still another year with her ill see how that turns out. And I'm thinking about how I would do trying to write a novel in month for nanowritemonth, at least I think I will be able to beat holtz. There is always the girl from polish but she is to good looking and on top of it I think she lives in like amity or something like that. Who am I a such a fucking prude?  As the French say Je ne sais pas. I don't know I will have time for a longer update sometime later.

      unday, March 28, 2004 Well time to update once again before CAPT testing starts which is the most great fun one could ever expirience. But on a lighter note  1. Left 2. Right crossover 3. Left back over 4. Kick (right then left, 45 degrees) 5. Twist 6. Throw 7. Follow through Posted by: JP / 7:45 PM Saturday, March 27, 2004 More posting like 10 seconds after the previous post. School sucks, CAPT testing next week and I know I will pass but its too much pressure, you have to pass or you wont graduate I mean really how stupid is that and plus most of the test is unrepresented there are basically no right answers so hey I think laterally and my answers are right to me and maybe not the tester. I think I got like 17/45 on my French test which I will bomb undoubted. And my polish test I broke 55% another test Tuesday but I think I will do a bit better because I forgot the days of the week SRODA damn it. I want my PS2 back so at least I can drown myself in senseless killing or something. Have homework to do but hey I forgot the notebook so FUCK it. I also went to track this morning it wasn't that bad, hips I cant forget hips and I cant 5 step quickly because I will end up trying for a 7 step but not finishing with a kick, maybe I should read up and form some, you know because I have time, because I am a lifeless nerd with no true friends no life, and no guts. She was there a bunch of times I could have asked her, when we where talking about college or something or I could have went to do some laps and just by chance she was there and I would stop to talk and possibly flirt but she seems to be friendly with all the guys she's around, even with john or that other kid. Posted by: JP / 6:06 PM Well it has been a while since I have posted. I now have an official web site create and hand edited by Moe. Also there is a debate team section and ARC section. While on the topic of ARC, our launch got bucked beyond human belief. I found out what was wrong and Constantine tried to blame it on us but if he knew anything about racketeer which he says he does he should know a lot more about multistage and why you use tape and he should have stopped the launch if he though the rocket was going to be un safe. Another note on Constantine, he's going with Kelly a freshman who is way out of his league to pin dance tonight and alas I couldn't top him, I couldn't get a date, I mean I probably could have or I cold have taken Jane but you know, I should have asked Rachel but then again I think Jesse would be a bit creeped out about me going with his sister, Ranting of a mad man this is. I guess I have a lot of time to work on my 5 step in javelin and disk and shot. Fuck what a bitch I should have bought tickets to go and hang out with chuck and tino and tiff and Sean but hey I'm an idiot, and plus my parents would have to make a big deal about it and I would have to shoot myself plus I would have to stand up to minton for not working lights but hey I didn't know, even though I did, and yeah I don't know if I mentioned it but I do have a website that I created and you know doing stuff to but I'm keeping it a secret from my friends because I have a lot incriminating shit in this blog and will on that page. Posted by: JP / 5:59 PM Wednesday, March 17, 2004 Hey guess what 4 more inches of snow, in the middle of March, I stayed home today missed a lot of homework and class work, but hey I learned to use the menu command which is cool and now I wont need a hundred million small commands but rather one really really long one. ARC should be launching tomorrow but alas we aren't but we are building and I am considering to go running tomorrow after school to about 3 you know until the girls start their practices so I can talk to Rachel possibly. Debate team might as well disband because we haven't had any meetings recently, and next year we will have like 5 members Posted by: JP / 5:01 PM Monday, March 15, 2004 They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now. You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or sincere, but that they are as confused as you. You look at your job...and it is not even close to what you thought you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't. One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward. You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you. Or you lay in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough that you want to get to know better. Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person. One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap. Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic. You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision. You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself.....and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender! What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out." Posted by: JP / 6:06 PM Thursday, March 11, 2004 Well it is time to start talking about track! Well conditioning is hell even though it only is one hour i can't wait till the practices are 3 hours. Nothing else to say. Posted by: JP / 7:03 PM Wednesday, March 10, 2004 Well time to post once again, I don't know how I will be able to do NaNoWriteMonth if I cant post everyday and be very wordy. Well I learned who likes me today, and that was ohhh so fun, Jane or Quasimodo as she is called. Damn I would have retired McGowan and Constantine kept it a secret so at least there was a chance of some one good looking liking me. Well its the middle of the week and Polish class wasn't bad, I didn't do well of the test, and a test if French I thought I did well on because I am good at correcting sentences, I BOMBED , that is BOMBED for those who don't know how to read Posted by: JP / 8:18 PM Monday, March 08, 2004 Yeah that's what's on my computer \/\/\/\/\/ down there annoying because you now have to scroll all the way down father to read any other random ranting of a mad man. Well today was very fun, went to English did hypocrites then the library for 2 hours for polish and other assorted homework and then I started the baking soda lab with is oh so fun. Then I ended with more CAPT practice in Algebra 2 which was beyond easy but just boring. I have track conditioning tomorrow and I get to hand in all my sheets along with my goals. My goals for those who don't know yet, are as follows: 100 Ft - Hammer 100 Ft - Javelin 92 Ft - Discus 30 Ft - Shot >30 - 200  And guess what pin dance is coming up so I don't know what I will do, I think if I am going to go I should bring someone and I have to top Chuck who is bringing a senior and constantinos who is bringing a hot freshman. I think I might as out Carlie or maybe Rachel, but I don't know maybe Jesse will get mad at me for going to the dance with his sister. Posted by: JP / 2:38 PM Saturday, March 06, 2004 1.

But i get to go to Iggy's house to work on the rocket at 1 probably maybe. I have to find an artist, a musician, and a writer who each have a work that defines me. Posted by: JP / 12:44 PM Thursday, March 04, 2004 Well time for an update, have homework to make up from being sick, debate team is trying to raise money, like every other club I am in. Odd fellas show tomorrow but I don't think I will go, but Socom game tonight, probably will play, no life nothing else is coming to mind except I need to post some links for you people. Posted by: JP / 5:39 PM Monday, March 01, 2004 Well stayed home from school because I was sick. Lets recap yesterday, I went o church, that surprise party, which wasn't that bad. Some not bad looking girls, but they possibly be related to me. Well the I did my brooks assignment, and that dumb paragraph I didn't do before. I guess I only didn't do my launcher or workout. Well ok that's all for now Posted by: JP / 11:26 AM Saturday, February 28, 2004 Well time to update on the completedness of my list. By my count I have finished 6 things on my list. I have gone to football, done my english project, order engine mounts, contact constantinos, get the engines ordered and fasting. Posted by: JP / 6:23 PM Ohh yeah i also was reading a friends blog, and in it he was professing his crush for this girl my friend have liked for a while now. And now this should become interesting, but the person they are fighting over isn't that great. I mean I see what they are talking about, she isn't that bad looking she is smart but not something to fight over. Posted by: JP / 7:48 AM Well I'm going through my bookmark that I got with downloading Mozilla, which is a superior open source web browser, and I found this cool websites, the open directory project. It is this project to clean up the internet and categorize it for free and people can become editors of categories, so I'm thinking of editing the throwing portion of a track and field category because I'm interested in. Posted by: JP / 7:44 AM Friday, February 27, 2004 Well I fell sick. I have a shit load of stuff to do this weekend. 1. Order engine mounts for rocket clun 2. Contact Constantinos about engines 3. If he doesn't have them, order them. 4. Redo my entire launcher. 5. Find a place where I can get a launch rod. 6. Workout 7. Two different parties on Sunday 8. Football on Satureday 9. Project Due Monday 10. Sleep 11. Fasting 12. Church 13. Notes for US History 14. Assignment for US History  There are probably some thing im forgetting and I know I will never complete everything. Posted by: JP / 7:54 PM Thursday, February 26, 2004 Well I think before I start putting goals online I should put a little about myself. I am right now a 15 year old sophmore at Bunnell High School. Bunnell is in Stratford and is like most towns of a similar sizes, bt normally boring as hell. I am what some people term, a "nerd" or a "geek." I do a bunch of clubs, Aeronautics and Rocketry Club, Future Business Leaders of America, Debate Team, French Club. I also do Indoor Track and Outdoor Track. Well I will post on these clubs tommorow or some other time to keep you interested though heres an interesting link > > > http://www.nomoreaolcds.com/ Trust me you will love that. Posted by: JP / 9:18 PM Well I also want to post want I want to do in track this year. I want to throw over 100 feet in hammer, over 30 feet in shot, over 100 in disk, and over 90 in Javalin. Well those are my goals and I know they are unachievable by me but hey aim for the moon, even if you miss you'll land amoung the stars Posted by: JP / 6:32 PM Hey! This is my first blog entry. I don't know why i created this, maybe to create an outlet for things i don't want to tell anyone I know. It's like no one acutally cares or they would make a huge deal of anything. They are kind of like the people To Kill A Mockingbird. They are like Maycombs' citizens, they are giant gossips and everywhere is backstabbing but I guess that's High School. This is cool because this is a site no one, I know, knows about. Posted by: JP / 6:29 PM

      Well ok I was underway on a new post like a minute ago but the fucking computer froze. I'm going to update on everything that has been going on, well lets see, I'm going to go back as far as I can think.  Sunday, nothing I did nothing really interesting, a lot of homework and stuff like that, i finished the scouting report for track. It took me an hour or two, but hey, I realized that I am varsity, in Jav with 113'6" and in shot with 29'3". Relay for life was fun. I played ultimate frisbee with a bunch of people, shit that was fun, i think i should work on my throws so i can get better and get on a good college team. There was a lot of sitting around and talking, not bad actually lots of fun stuff. I went home at  11 and looked around for the key in my garage, but I couldnt find it, so i went back because my parents would flip a shit if i woke them. Well i spent the rest of the night, since Friday morning i have had less that 12 hours of sleep, in 87 hours I think. During the week i had a lot of homework, god forskaen stuff tests and what not, pissed off about that, my teachers are giving me a lot of work for the end of the year and i dont know what to write maybe if i had more time to write i would do better but hey track ends soon enough. Took bad but ill do hammer too so that should be fun and if no one else from bunnell does it I should have a school record.

      Wow I am about a third of the way done with Programming for idiots and this stuff seems so out there but it makes sense, but looking at C++ or any other language I am like, damn i will never learn this. But like Joe Dirt says keep on keeping on. Well what I am doing right ow is trying to make a program, specifically one for track meets. It is one that will do scoring and sorting and everything like that. I hope I can finish this by the time I am a senior so maybe we could try it out one day in a meet, or at one of our practice meets.

      Well along with the academic schedule I think I should talk a little about my other stuff I did like Debate Team. Well my first club that I did was debate team. That wasn't that bad; we had one debate all year, I did participate in that one and we got knocked out in the first round even though we should have one. I got a fairly decent score, I'm not sure what it was right now but like a 22 or something one round and like 27 the next. A lot of talk and next year should be promising with my new links and stuff updated, I hope if I have time think summer. Not a bad year hopefully we will go to some more debates next year and possibly host one my senior year which would be awesome! ARC was ARC, we almost killed little Fonda and Rachel with our rocket and started a fire. Next year one engine per stage for us. Actually I don't feel like writing right now I don't know why I feel as if I should be working or something. Well everything after this point is what I am editing at 8:03 pm Saturday June 26th. Well Track, specifically indoor and outdoor track. Indoor wasn't bad thisyear, I didn't do as much running as I usually do which is a plus and I did get better in shot put which is good but I still haven't broken 30 feet which is really buggin me a lot! Had a lot of fun with the seniors and will have fun with those returning, but I don't think some people should be allowed to do track jsut because they don't take it seriously. This was the first time I met Rachel who I have had a crush on for a little while. But next year she will be going away to Savanah College of Art and Design and I will be stuck at Bunnell for two more years. But hey maybe I will try my luck luck with Carlie who I also met in indoor track. Next year she will be a senior and do I honestly think I stand a chance to go out with a senior. She would rather go out with Austin or a friend to prom or ring dance over me a dumb rash prude junior. But that is enough wallowing in self pity because I hear that Lindsay and Teddy split up which is an interesting development. I seriously doubt she would have any interest in me because she could get any guy she wants in our grade probably, and she definately could get any of my friends if she wanted to. But maybe I do stand a chance because she did talk about me once or twice to Julie, so thats a plus, but hey how will I ever know if i don't try or have someone try. Outdoor track was good because i got varsity for Javalin and I will get better bcause I plan to lift and shit. Also I broke what I wanted to for disk, which was 90 and i got 91 and change. In shot I quite because that i no longer my forte but Javalin and hammer. Also i set the school record in hammer but had it broken by Marcin 3 times in a row. If I only threw what I normally throw I could have been in the finals and possibly gotten all state or something. By the time I am a senior I will have my name on one of those Banners!

      Well I guess it is the end of another scow year and I am one year closer to graduating. I think that scares me a lot, I am scared to fail at life I don't want to become just another brick in the wall, I want to be an individual just someone who is the best at what they do and enjoys what they do. But lets look back on the year that was my sophomore year in high school. This year I had a not bad schedule, it wasn't too hard or too easy just right. English was my first period class and I already commented on it in a previous post. Business law was my second class and I also posted on that last week sometime. My third period class was Gym/Study Hall. First of all I am amazed that some of these people have been able to live 15 years of their lives in this world without being shot for being so stupid. Especially those want to be thugs/pimps who are just dumb pieces of shit who will end up in jail or working at one of the local retail stores like Walmart. Gym wasn't that bad this year, had some fun meet some new people, some hot click in my class, which I was lucky and I sure would have banged Mollis in a heartbeat. Well fourth period was with Miss Brooks. I mean people made her out to be much worse than she was, she wasn't that bad. People we only got homework once a week a test every couple of months, it was easy, so what she gave us a shitload of stuff to do at the end of the year. We were better prepared for the final than Mr Priohs classes. Even though she is big fat and black and from the south I mean really I don't have anything against her like Dan does. Dan is the biggest racist I know. Fifth period with Mr Yaffe was probably one of the best classes I have had in a while. It was fun playing jeopardy but we also learned some cool shit that actually may help us in life. Jeopardy was fun with Mr Yaffe and if ever need help making some sort of powerpoint or something I know who I will go to. Period six was French 3 with Mrs. Bontemps. I mean people made her class out a lot harder than it was; and at time it may have been harder but I don't know I enjoyed this year we had some fun times just sitting around talking even though people who don't participate or anything get better grades than me I still know I smarter than them. It was fun and she is leaving for a year, I don't now why she is a good teacher and I don't want to have to put up with a new French teacher for a year then hopefully have Mrs. Bontemps come back. Come on people so what she didn't curve, we all passed and no one at Stratford High did; and their teacher wrote the test. Period seven was with Mrs. Pappano who was one of the best teachers ever, she is fun and she actually teaches the stuff not like some teachers who don't do anything at all with their classes. I think I learned more in 1 week in her class that I did in all of Mr Smiths class. I hope that I get her in the future for some math class or a study hall because she is a good teacher and fun too. Polish which was another class I took wasn't bad, it was at Yale once a week. Even though it conflicted with my schedule for track I didn't mind, because there was some fine ass there. Fun I learned a lot especially Brunos bakery in New York City, which had some of the best desserts I have had. And I saw Times Square which is over rated but it was cool.

      Right now I am updating from Business law, i finished my test in about a little over a half hour, and yes i did get my extra credit points. I took my old book coer and flipped it inside out. An easy 5 extra credit points, and the person who gets it next year gets shanked. so i figure about 100 maybe a 101. English wasnt that bad for the most part, the Essay what will killed me because it is poorly written and it is not very good. Not bad i am lazy and i dont want to make too muhc noise plus i have over 40 minutes left here.

      Well tommmorow finals start for me, but you all already knew that, you all already knew that because your all avid readers of my blog. Well it is now time to reflect on the year that was in Englihs. It wasnt bad, not as easy as i had hoped and my grades arent as good as they should be but i think i will do well on this paper. Thank god for debate team which will help me to do well on this kind of shit. Mrs. Martire wasnt that bad, too much writing at the end of the year. We should have gone a lttle quicker so not to rush the end of the year like this. All in all not a bad year and i wouldnt mind having her again but alas i wont because im a lazy bum wwho wont do yearbook because im going to have a full year already. Business law is too wasy and i hate the class if it was more interesting like a moke trial one week or something along those liens to get people excited about the class or at least not sleeping.  I also plan to update on my finals after i take them and by popular demand (meaning because im bored) I will update my profile with some sort of picture, and post a music list of everything i have playing in Winamp. Also i am planning on having a full summer here is a list that i may or may not have posted before: 1.  Read the required reading 2.  Do the projects really well 3.  Read some other books, like Catch-22 or something along those lines 4.  Retool the debate team website 5.  Retool a ARC website 6.  Retool my webpages 7.  Get my permit 8.  Get a Javalin and a hammer 9.  Job and money 10. Volunteer 11. New computer 12. Internship 13. Lifting 14. Learn C++ or some other programming language

      I am currently updating from my school library. I would have had two other posts up but my no so good computer is horrible and it did not publish the updates. I am going to start finals of Friday, with English from 8:00 to 10:00, then Business Law at 10:15 to 12:15. These shouldn't be that bad except my English teacher is going to use the final as a place to test our Frankenstein knowledge. Business law will be a bitch but I will get 5  extra credit points by bringing in a book cover which she says is worth 5 points. I already have a 99 average so I mean I just have to score 95 or over to keep my average up. Speaking of averages, my average is like an 84 and the people who don't do anything just talk are getting better grades than me even though I understand the material better than they do. Messed UP! My Monday final is US History from Miss Brook 10:15 to 12:15, meaning I get to sleep in late and what not, or some extra study time. We get to use our notes on this so hey I will throw in a couple of important people here and there and put all the definitions on the notes where they should be so I can get away with it.  Tuesday will be Chemistry from 8:00 to 10:00, with Mr. Yaffe, his final shouldn't be that hard but it will be rather comprehensive and have some abstract concepts. The second final that day is French 3. That final will run from 10:15 to 12:15. This probably will be my hardest and longest final. There are supposed to be over 200 questions or something like that and people from last year barely finished. Wednesday I have one final, Algebra 2 with Mrs. Pappano, this should be an easier final but it should have more on it with lots of hard work and negatives (DANGER ZONE!) This final is 8:00 to 10:00.  In the mean time I have hammer championships in New Britain tomorrow, right now I am throwing around 100 or 105 feet and last year to go Allstate you have to throw about 110 or 112 so if I do well and the weather is on my side I should make Allstate. The thing is that if I do it will be a while before they update the banners and Krebbs or anyone else will never believe me. Lots of studying to do this week but not to long till the end of school.

      Well I was reading an old New York Times Magazine when I came across this leter to the Ethicist it read as follows:  I teach business ethics for a local university. I wonder how you would respond to this classic moral dilema: John walks into a village and finds Mary holding 15 people hostage. Mary says that she will kill them all unless John takes a gun and kills one of the hostages. All the hostages are innocent people with families. What should John do.  Randy Cohen the Ethicist replied:  What kind of business are you preparing your students for? Microsoft?   Thats all I feel like posting today but hey maybe tommorow

      Right now i am updaing my blog fro schoolo, I am actually mazaed that the school does not block this website and thats good because I created a blog to act a a backup, but it doesnt have any formating like tables or stuff like that. Today was really damn hot. I mean I couldnt find any shorts this morning that were clean and I went through the day in long pants. English wasnt that bad except for Charles I mean now really he over reacts a lot, he almost acts like a girl and that annoys me a a little. Business law is annoying because we are doing these dumb worksheets which we will use for an open notebook test next Monday. Study hall was boring but I was only defeated in tic tac toe  time out of about 25 times. US History was hot as hell, the period was long and boring and apparently Miss Brooks was wrong on the 3rd reich, not The Holy Roman Empire and Napolean, but the 2 previoous rulers of Germany. Chemistry was easy because we had an open notebook test which I got a hundred on according to Jesse. French was really hot and i broke a sweat just sitting there. I did a translation and some questions. Then to Algebra two where I did a quiz and some work on worksheets and there was a sub not the teacher. And yeah it was really hot. I will update more tonight.

      Damn I have finished a lot of my paper, I've done basically half way done, up to the Tet offensive, and I still have to do a works citied and citations and appendixes. Lets see French is god forsaken, and some shit like that a shit load of translations to do. Business law is boring and rhetorical, and English is a bitch.

      Well it has been summer for an entire what, couple of weeks. I'll list my accomplishments: 1.  Read both of my required reading books and another 3 books. 2.  the topics of one fo the books was programming in Basic and the other was a guide to HTML so there are three things on my list kindof done.  3.  I still haven't done anything for money, and money is what is needed to buy javalins and hammers, but i found really really cheap javalins for like $65 online so I'm going to order one.  4.  I have been working on the webpages for myself and the Debate team. So far I have about three fourths of the Debate team website done but I need to upload a couple of article which I am going to have to type. The ARC webste needs to be scratched and started over because  the links are messed up. Also I may change the pages because I found a way to make numbered lists which would help but I don't think it is necessary. 5.  I have been studying for my permit test, and I am going for it on Thursday. My dad has threatened to make me get my hair cut or he wont allow me to get it with him but those are empty lies. He said that before be never followed through with it. 6.  Tommorow actually I plan on going to pani Krysa's house and Brian's Aunt and Uncle and see if they have anything for me to do. Generally that is an easy couple of dollars.   Ok here is that list I probably had at least 2 or 3 times, here is what's done: 1.  Read the required reading  2. Do the projects really well 3.  Read some other books, like Catch-22 or something along those lines  4.  Retool the debate team website  5. Retool a ARC website 6. Retool my webpages 7. Get my permit 8. Get a Javalin and a hammer 9. Job and money 10.  Volunteer  11. New computer 12.  Internship (Can't do this, next year) 13. Lifting 14.  Learn C++ or some other programming language  (Working on basic right now actually, maybe going to move onto PASCAL or C)
