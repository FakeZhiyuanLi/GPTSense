       Alcohol in the human body:   Ethanol, or more commonly known as alcohol, is found in a variety of popular beverages (bear, wine & spirits). It is one of the most used (and abused) drugs in our society. It is produced by the fermentation of fruits, vegetables, or grains by yeast which converts the carbohydrates into ethyl alcohol or ethanol. Alcohol can be taken up by any body surface, but is most efficiently taken up as it is usually consumed; after drinking an alcoholic beverage. When it enters the body, ethanol is absorbed over almost the entire length of the digestive tract. About 90% of ethanol consumed is absorbed into the blood stream, irrespective of the presence of food (food only slows the process down). Ethanol is then carried all over the body, particularly places, like the brain and the liver, which are highly perfused with blood. In the liver, ethanol is broken down by an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase into acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is a poison which is the main cause of the harmful effects of alcohol consumption. Acetaldehyde is then converted into acetate by an enzyme called acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Acetate is a harmless compound, used to create energy. It is estimated that the total amount of ethanol broken down per hour is in the range of 0.1-0.3 grams per kilogram body weight per hour. These fundamental processes are common to all human beings and sufficient to break down moderate quantities of alcohol. However, environmental factors (drinking habits) and genetic factors (activities of the enzymes involved) may affect the rate of alcohol metabolism. An example of this would be with about 40% of Asians, whose acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme is inactive, meaning they have higher levels of acetaldehyde in the blood upon alcohol consumption, causing facial flushing, cardiac arrhythmia, headache and vomiting. When more alcohol than the mentioned above enzymes can break down is consumed, other enzymes will help with the break down of ethanol. The activity of these enzymes contributes to the toxicity and possibly carcinogenicity in alcoholics. Hardly any alcohol is excreted with urine, breath and tears, which means that practically all of it is broken down. 90-98% of consumed alcohol is broken down, 1-5% is excreted via the lungs and 1-3% is excreted via the other routes such as urine (0.5-2.0%) and sweat (up to 0.5%).  Alcohol depresses parts of the central nervous system, slowing down some of our brain functions. Various parts of the central nervous system are depressed by alcohol, with all sorts of consequences. For example, when the brain's speech centres are inhibited, this causes slurred speech; when the vision centres are affected this produces distorted vision; when the co-ordination centres are depressed this results in loss of balance and limb control. The strong depressant effect of alcohol lasts for a few hours after drinking, but alcohol also produces a weaker agitation (or irritation) of the nervous system that lasts much longer. This is the cause of the hangover and shakiness. It's due to the irritation of the nervous system by alcohol drunk many hours before. This effect often leads heavy evening drinkers to drink again the next morning, as the agitation can be temporarily overcome by drinking more alcohol. Thus, a vicious circle is set in motion, which can play a large part in alcoholic drinking patterns.

       Trepanation   Trepanation is the drilling of a hole in the head. It is one of the oldest surgical practices and is still practiced religiously in some African tribes. When done properly, it will give the person to whom it was done to, a permanent 'high'. If your normal self is '0' and LSD is '100', a good dose of hash is lets say '50', then trepanation is about '30' (approximately 2 pints of lager); a nice feeling.

       Twenty minute orgasm   The male pig is the mammal with the longest orgasm. When mating he will ejaculate a whopping half a pint of sperm. Then to make sure it doesn't just poor out of the female pig, he will ejaculate a sticky substance which blocks the hole. His penis is a cork screw shape (long, thin & curly). His orgasm lasts 20 minutes...

       Tips on keeping sober:   -Drink one glass of milk before drinking alcohol. It lines the stomach and slows down the intake of alcohol into the blood stream. Remember, drinking it afterwards will have no effect. -Have a good meal before drinking. The food absorbs the alcohol and slows down the diffusion of alcohol into the blood stream. -Keep eating snacks which are offered to you (if they are). Not only does it slow keep up the amount of food in the stomach and small intestine, but it will also slow down the rate at which you drink. -Drink lots of water. For every glass of alcohol you drink, you must drink at least one glass of water. Alcohol decreases the release of ADH, therefore, more water is in the urine, therefore, you will be in the toilet a lot. But this means you must drink lots of water, to compensate for the extra water loss. -Moderate your drinking. Do not drink lots of alcohol in a short space of time, but spread this amount out over a longer period of time. Also you do not need to stick to alcohol; nobody is going to tell you off if you have a soft drink now and again. -Know your limit. If you start to feel as if you are forgetting the laws of gravity, stop drinking and switch to soft drinks or water. -Count your drinks. -Know what you are drinking.  -Keep an eye on your drink. It could be spiked while you are not looking.

       Firepower   London has had thousands of devastating fires from the great fire of London in 1666 to the blitz in the Second World War. These have wiped out hundreds of homes and killed many people. But every time this happens, London grows stronger. London was originally built by the Romans, because of its ideal location. It would be near an estuary and almost surrounded by marshland, so it could not be invaded. London was invaded only once, by the Anglo-Saxons, who drove the Romans out. They literally burnt the entire city with those who did not run away in it. Beneath London, there is a reddy colour to the soil. Red is the colour of blood, fire and war. Red is the colour of the Roman buildings which were burned to the ground. Red is the colour of power and victory. Some say that the name “London” comes from the Celtic: “londus” meaning “fierce”. In 1666, the great fire of London wiped out a large part of the centre of London. Wren was the architect who rebuilt most of the replacing buildings, including the new st Paul’s Cathedral. He told one of his workers to go to the site and mark the exact point above which the globe hemisphere would go. This worker found a tombstone in the rubble, which had nothing written on it except for one Latin word at the top which translates to “we will rise”.

      I think everyday swearing is fucking marvellous. People say they are used when you dont know what to say. But one knows what he is saying and needs to use these words (eg. you fucking arsehole). "You know what I mean?" is said when people dont know what to say. These are 'bad' words. Everyday swearing shoold be used more often.

      It can be said that you learn through mistakes. I sure hope that's true because I don't want to have blood poring out of my right leg, torn shorts and torn laces (at first, later that day I had 1/4 of the original length of the shoe lace & a shoe which was falling off my foot every now and again). For those who don't want to make this mistake to start with, DON'T DIVE ON CONCRETE, NO-MATTER HOW INTO THE SPORT YOU ARE!

       UFOs   After having watched a program on TV about UFOs I beleive in them even less. They didn't have any hard data, it was all just people claiming to have seen them. There was one clip where all you could see was the back of the necks of some soldiers and a bright light. When some farmers were interviewed about a 'landing', they all came up with different information. The army came in to dig up whatever was on the metal detector; it was a small chunk of iron, which can be found anywhere.

       Did NASA con the world?   Did NASA con the world about the landing on the moon? The photos are certainly fakes, with wind, shadows & no stars. So should Armstrong really be famous? Find out next Wednesday at 9pm on C5. I definitely wont miss it.

       Vote us out of the EU   I caught the last few minutes of the BBC news, where they wanted us to vote ourselves out of the EU. I didn't catch any of the arguments but made a few of my own. I, for a start, am strongly against the euro (partly because I hate frogs), but mostly because I am proud to be British and love the Pound. It is one of the srongest currencies in the world and I think that both the EU and America want Britain to join their currency; because if we did, it would be by far the strongest currency. To be safe from the Euro, we must leave the EU. We don't need the EU. There is a higher rate of unemployment within the EU than out of it. Not only will we be safe from the Euro, but we will be able to be a seperate country, have our own laws...

       Exams   Today I had my first proper exam day. Previously I have only had Art and English litterature. Today I had Geography in the morning, One hour of sunbathing, half an hour of football, an hour of sitting around talking (in the sun) and then a Biology exam. I finished both exams in good time, which I am rather pleased about. But why is it that even when I finish the paper, I still manage to get a bad mark?

      I can't believe that stupid Swiss referee disallowed Campbell's goal. England beat Portugal in the match last night, and the w***** took it on to extra time and penalties. But I would like to congratulate Portugal. They scored two very good goals, and the goal keeper played very well.
