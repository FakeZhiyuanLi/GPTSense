       rhema - spoken by the living voice of God    Faith come from hearing the sound of His voice Romans 10:17      Behold She Comes   Behold there are three in the fire We are one in three & three in one It is the fire of our glory.  For there is a glory of the Father And a glory of the Son And a glory of the Spirit  Yet the glory is one.  And yet,  There is the appearance  . . .  of a fourth  . . .   in the fire She is dressed in white For it is the bride  She is invite to partake of our glory That she might be changed In our presence That we may be made one       A Light in the Darkness   I see a picture of the earth and it is mired in darkness.   I see one point of light in the darkness, And it is the church. It is the bride of the Lamb.  Because of the blood of the Lamb, Spiritually, She is Judah.  She goes forth with the song of the Lord Upon her lips.  As she goes forth, Step by step, She drives back the darkness.  The light of the Lamb within her Drives out the darkness  Because.....  Darkness is simply The absence of light.  Moving forward, The darkness is driven back And the world realizes that It has a choice.  It can retreat with the darkness Or it can remain In the glorious light of the Lamb And be changed.  Every man, woman, and child chooses Either to retreat with the darkness Or remain in the light and be changed.       The Destiny of the Bride   I see a picture of three rings. The Lord imparts these three rings to the church. The first ring is a ring of promise; such as a man gives to a woman when he has asked her to marry him. It is illustrated in the giving of the Holy Spirit to the church.  The second ring is a ring of submission. It is like a slave’s collar and speaks of the complete and absolute submission of the church to the Lordship of Christ.  The third ring is a ring of authority, a signet ring. It represents the authority of God conferred upon the church, His bride. The receiving of the third ring is contingent upon having accepted the first two rings.  The acceptance of God’s promises and the submission to His Lordship precede moving in the authority of God. The receiving of the first two rings is not accomplished all at once; it is a process arrived at over time.  The ring of God’s authority signifies the release of God’s presence in and through the church both individually and corporately.  After the three rings I see a robe. It is the train of God’s glory, of His righteousness. It is not a robe of covering in that it is not meant to cover sin or uncleanness. It is a robe of confirmation, bestowed upon the church in actual fact by the Holy Spirit after the three rings have been received.  And lastly I see a pair of sandals. They are placed upon the feet of the bride to tread under foot the works of darkness and the authority of the prince of darkness.  And I see the bride placing her foot upon the neck of the prince of darkness and forcing him to bow before the throne of the Lamb; for this is the function of the church, which is His bride. For as it is written, "every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess..."  And he will behold her and will acknowledge her superlative beauty, but he will hate her as she forces him to bow before the Lamb.         The Violence of His Love    My love for you is an unrelenting, unquenchable fire says the Lord. There is violence to My love.  It was through the violence of My love That I cleansed My courts And cast out all who rose up against Me.  It was through the violence of My love That I redeemed mankind, Sending My only Son to die that you might live.  It is through the violence of My love That I that I conform you to the image of that Son, Your redeemer.  It is through the violence of My love That through you, The church, the bride of the Lamb, That I continually take back that which is mine by right.  This is the humanity that I take back from those I cast from My presence.  And it is through the violence of My love That through you, The church, Moving in My authority, Reflecting My glory, That I will force the prince of darkness to bow before Me.  He will hate you As he hates Me, As you force him to bow before Me.       Transparence    I see this picture of the Father’s glory Coming as a ray of light from His throne. Then I see three figures that the light strikes That change the quality and intensity of the light.  The first figure I see is the cross. It is transparent. As the light of the Father’s glory hits it, It reacts like both a magnifying glass And a prism Simultaneously. It intensifies the light And changes the color As the light continues through the cross.  The next figure I see Is a dove. It is the Holy Spirit. He also is transparent. He is flying around like crazy Catching the colors of the prism, Refocusing them, And increasing their intensity even more.   The third figure I see Is a woman. It is the church, The bride of the Lamb.  She also is transparent. She has to keep her eyes On the dove. She has to catch the light With her body And turn it to bring it to focus On the forth figure,  Which is the world.  If she takes her eyes off the dove To look at the world, She can’t respond to His movements And the light ceases to focus on the world.  But if she keeps her eyes on Him And turns the light with her body To focus on the world, The light increases in intensity once more And lights the world so that it is no longer in darkness.

      For I am both the wind and the rain to you says the Lord.  When the wind of My Spirit blows upon you, I would have you be as a windmill, your blades moving under the impetus of my presence. The blades don’t seek to catch or control the wind. They are there to be moved by it for a specific purpose. The wind is the breath of My Spirit.  I am also the rain. The water that flows from underneath my throne is there to rain blessing and anointing upon you. I would have you be as a transparent conduit that all might look at you and see the water of my presence in your life. This water has no impurities or contaminants in it for it too represents my presence. The conduit does not seek to capture or divert the water because it is a vessel I would flow through completely unimpeded.

      For I am strong in your weakness, says the Lord. I would give you the steadfastness of Moses, who came before Pharaoh and said, “this says the Lord to you, let my people go.”  I would give you the vision of David, who looked upon Goliath in the shadow of My glory and asked. “who is this uncircumcised Philistine to defy the armies of the living God?”  I would give you the faith of Elijah, who challenged the prophets of Baal and defeated them in my name.  I would have you to know, my people, that I know your struggles and temptations. It is I who will cause you to fail, says the Lord, that your strength may come to nothing. It is only then that my strength will be released in you. Then you will be able to move in my power, under my anointing.  It will bring glory to me. Then you will stand in awe in my presence and marvel at the great things God has done for you.

      He saw a threshold of a doorway from the inside.  There’s a pause button and it’s pushed in.  I can hear two sounds coming from outside: a rooster crowing it’s head off, then there’s a human voice shouting from the outside, “ it’s a new day.”.  There’s a person standing at the doorway just inside -  they’ve paused right there.  Two things have made them pause: a sense of their own stability - they like the way things have been going they like things that they are used to.  They are comfortable with them and don’t want to change. The second is God’s predictability- they like to know what God is doing and that he does the same thing all the time.  When certain things happen that’s God, they want to know how ti’s going to happen.  This has stalled them in the doorway- for a long time.  They’ve heard the sounds outside but have been so comfortable with what they’re familiar with and how they want God to move.  God’s heart ways you’ve got to lay these down.  You can’t be intimate with me because you’ve got one in each hand.  Until you put them down you can’t push the button off pause and walk through the door.

      I see a picture of the church as a dwelling.  It is a building with double doors.  There are two people standing outside the doors, each knocking on one door.  The doors are opened inward and the church waits.  Both people are offering something.  On the right, the world is offering wealth beyond imagination.  On the left, the Holy Spirit is offering the reproaches of the Son.  We are asked to take our pulse.  What does our heart truly beat for; the things of the world or the reproaches of Christ, which will conform us to His image?  It’s not a matter of where we will spend eternity but how we will spend eternity.

      For I am a God of generations says the Lord.  I am redeeming generations.  I am reaching across generations and I am anointing them for service.  I am anointing them to build my kingdom one generation at a time.  Each generation is building upon the other’s work.  They are building an extending my kingdom as past generations built the great cathedrals of Europe.  Each generation is anointed to perform a specific work, which is related to and built upon what I have accomplished in previous generations.  Yet the most high does not dwell in a building made by human hands.  I have chosen to dwell in a people.  I have chosen to dwell in them generationally.  Each generation is experiencing more revelation than the previous one. Each generation experiencing more of My glory as I express myself through them. They are to reflect my glory, bear my fragrance, reach out, and touch the world, redeeming generation after generation, until my coming, the great and terrible day of the Lord.  For behold I come, and I come quickly.

      I am a God that redeems people, and I am a God that redeems time.  And I don’t counsel with you about who I should redeem or about what I should forgive or whether I should restore this one or that one because I am utterly sovereign.  And so I come to you and I have brought redemption to you and there are those that I would come and I would bring a redemption of time.  Time that they thought was lost; time that they thought was wasted.  And I will bring those back and I will restore them, those who have been without the church.  Those who have been a long way off, that you have observed from a distance, and you see their life out of order.  I will redeem that time, I will restore those people, I will anoint them for service and I will do it in my sovereignty and you are not to question me about this you are to rejoice that I am a God that can redeem this time and can restore this individual.  That can take these many years that look like they were utterly without value and bring good from that.  You will recognize that anointing in these people and you are to receive them, gladly.

      I see this picture of the Lord as He extends his hands toward the church to embrace her. In His right hand He holds the cross; in His left hand He holds the empty tomb. He offers both the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His suffering.  We keep moving to His left because we want the one without the other. We have rejected personal holiness in favor of signs and wonders. We don’t understand that the Lord’s embrace is always with both hands.  The world looks at power as the ability to do a thing and authority as the right to do a thing. With the Lord, it’s the authority that produces the power. But the authority is produced by the systematic application of the cross to our soul. The power of His resurrection is produced and proceeded by the fellowship of His suffering.  This is the baptism into the sufferings of Christ He spoke about to James and John when they asked to sit on His right and left hand when He was revealed in His glory.

      Is it not an incomprehensible thing that I, the high and holy God, would deign to love man. It is understandable that you, as a created being, would love and worship me as the very essence of holiness and perfection. But why would I love you?  . . . . .    Because I choose to; it pleased me to have created you and to love you.  And in this love I always make the first overture. I always come to you first.   I poured out my love for you in the life of my Son, the spotless Lamb of God, that we might be one. “For love is of God,” not of man.  My love for you is inexhaustible, unrelenting, violent, and utterly preemptive but at the same time, completely approachable and invitingly toward you.

       Israel’s Rejection of God    The rejection of God by His people is many-fold. First we see the rejection of God by Adam. The Lord gives him authority over everything in the garden. He gives him but one rule. Do not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The tree of life was not forbidden. Adam disregards the command from the Lord’s own mouth, rejecting the authority of His words (His voice.)  Then we see Israel at the base of Mount Sinai. Moses goes up on the mountain to fellowship with God. Israel is terrified at the sound of His rumblings. They wait for Moses to come down from the mountain and then say to him: “We are terrified at the sound of His voice. You go up on the mountain, listen to what God tells you. Come down and tell us what he’s said and we’ll do it.” Here they reject His very voice.  Then we see Israel when they go to Samuel. They say to him: “We want a king like all the other nations of the earth.” In saying this they reject the very presence of the Lord in their lives as a people. This is a corporate decision. God rightly says to Samuel that it wasn’t Samuel that was rejected but God.  Although there are smatterings of repentance by individuals, mostly prophets and a very few kings, Israel’s rejection of God is complete.  Everyone is doing what is right in his own eyes.  What is not clear to everyone is that the descendants of Abraham are they that are of the faith of Abraham. His descendants are not natural descendants but spiritual descendants. The children of Israel have always been children of the promise, not children of the flesh. Scripture tells us that the children of the flesh have always persecuted the children of the promise.  We can see in the grafting in of Rahab, the harlot, and Ruth, the Moabitess, into the lineage of Christ, God’s heart toward a people of faith. He says repeatedly, “Today, if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.” God’s people have always been ‘a people who will hear His voice.’ The people of God have always been a people who respond to the sound of His voice.

      I see a picture of a fountain. It is the Water of Life that comes from beneath the throne of God. A circular stone wall to collect the water, both for use and for anointing surrounds it.   The water bears the fragrance of God. There is a fragrance of the Father, a fragrance of the Son, a fragrance of the Spirit, yet the fragrance is one.  The fountain is surrounded by multitudes of people who have come to partake of the water. They are crowded, encircling the fountain all around. There is a wind blowing outward from the fountain bringing the mist and the fragrance of God to the people who come seeking. The light of the sun creates a rainbow in the mist.  There are those who have been pushed close in around the fountain by the crowds. Some have dared to reach into the fountain with their fingertips because they want more than just the mist. They bring their fingers to their nose and the fragrance of God is almost overpowering to their senses. Others dip their whole hand in and apply it like perfume to other parts of their body and they swoon at the overwhelming power of His fragrance.  Then a young girl steps up on to the stone wall and, with her eyes closed, stands with her arms upraised in the mist and in the sun, partaking of both. Then she opens her eyes and, with a grin, leaps into the fountain with a shout.  The crowd is taken completely off guard by her action. She jumps and plays in the water, giggling and sputtering around like children do, with shouts of joy. The fountain laughs. Her clothes are completely soaked, saturated with the fragrance and anointing of God. Other children jump in with her, yelling for the rest to join them. They begin to splash those closest to the fountain, beckoning them in.  The “People of the Fountain” are called to bring its fragrance to a lost and dying world. They can bear as much or as little of the fragrance as they wish. The choice is theirs. They can dip their fingertips or have waters to swim in. The greater the saturation, the greater the influence and anointing. Impact is proportional to saturation.
