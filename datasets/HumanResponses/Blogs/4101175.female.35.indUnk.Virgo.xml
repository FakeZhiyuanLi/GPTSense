      "I always had the impression you didn't like me, Stacey," Andrew said to me the day we graduated from high school in Cleveland, OH. "Can't argue that one," I answered. "Have a nice life," I told him, and with that I turned and walked away. That was the last time I ever saw him. And I don't think he's crossed my mind even once since then. Until today.  My sister called tonight with excitement in her voice. "Did you get your Texas Jewish Post in the mail today?" she asked. "Yeah," I replied. "Did you open it?" she asked. "Not yet," I answered. "You might want to go read page 8," she suggested.  I went to the kitchen and tore through the stack of mail I'd placed on the island. I quickly turned to page 8. I saw a picture of a guy standing with a tallis around his shoulders. The face was vaguely familiar. I read the caption and couldn't believe my eyes. It was Andrew. Rabbi Andrew.  Rabbi  Andrew? No way. Andrew had become a rabbi? I never would have guessed. Never in a million years. And here he was in Dallas, the new Senior Rabbi at a huge synagogue here.  "Stacey, that's him, isn't it?" she asked. "The Andrew you went to high school and temple with? The Andrew you never liked? I remember you not liking him, Stace, but I can't remember why?"  Staring at his picture, I thought back to those days and remembered how self-absorbed and egotistical I thought he was. I remember him strutting down the halls, tossing his way-too-feathered hair from side-to-side. "Where did his hair go?", I wondered out loud as I stared at his bald head in the picture.  Yeah, that boy got on my nerves. I remember everyone raving over the solo he sang in the senior choir production. The song was "All the Time" and I remember cringing when I heard it, thinking that Barry Manilow sang it so much better.  "You haven't answered me," my sister said. "Why did you hate him so much?" I couldn't answer. I was lost in thought. "Well, Stace, since you don't have a good answer, let's go to services one Friday night and welcome him to Dallas. How exciting to have another Clevelander here." "No way!" I said. I bet he won't even remember me. "Sure he will," said my sister. "You look exactly the same. Come on, it'll be fun. Let's go."  All of the sudden the Jewish guilt hit me. I stood there staring at his photo. All of the sudden he didn't look so self-absorbed. In fact, he looked quite humble. "Yes," I told my sister. "Let's do it. Let's go to his temple and welcome a fellow homeboy to our adopted city. Why the hell not?"  My 36th birthday is just around the corner. Maybe time has mellowed me. Maybe time mellows all of us. Or maybe it is the season. The High Holy Days will be upon us soon, the time for reconciliation and renewal. In the spirit of the season, I think this is one old hatchet I am going to bury.

      It was a long drive to work today.  It was only raining, but you would have thought it was snowing the way the traffic barely crawled along at 5 MPH.    I popped in one of my favorite CD's, "Pearl" by Janis Joplin.  Now I have "Bobby McGee" stuck in my head.  What a voice, what soul Janis had.  I swear I missed my era.  I've always loved the music of the 60's and the 70's.  I am stuck there.  I guess I am a throwback.    Why is it that the best ones had to leave us so young and so often tragically?  I think she was 27 when she died.  And there are so many others who also departed way too soon...like Buddy Holly, Marvin, Stevie Ray, John Deutchendorf, Karen, and Elvis.  It really bites, so many songs left unsung.

      It just happened again for the 2nd time in as many weeks.  It was midnight.  I was walking my dog.  She stopped to sniff the fire hydrant at the corner house and bam -- I was attacked by the neighborhood frog.    I don't like bugs.  I don't like snakes.  And I don't like frogs jumping on my feet.  I must have screamed like I did last week because the next thing I knew the front door of the corner house opened and I heard a man's voice say, "Let me guess, maam.  A frog jumped on you again."  "Yes," I replied, "It happened again.  You need to keep your frog indoors, mister.  I'm tired of him landing on my foot."  Laughing, he said he'd never seen a frog in his yard.  He walked over to where my dog and I were standing.  He asked where it was and I pointed to his bushes and said that it hopped into them.    The streetlight cast a glow on his face and I could see his eyes roll.  I can tell the man thinks that I'm a meshugeneh.  Oh well, at least my dog didn't shit in his yard as she did when we had the same conversation last week.  I'm taking a different route tomorrow night.

      I am always amazed and disappointed at how many adults have trouble with math. I don't know if blame should be placed upon the teachers or the students, but it is so important in life and so disappointing that so many are so incompetent.  Just for fun I thought that I'd throw out some more problems   A function g(y) of one variable is strictly increasing iff g(y') > g(y") for any y' and y" s.t. y' > y". (a) State the definition of a maximum and a minimum. (b) Prove that for any strictly increasing function g(y), the problems max f(x) and max g[f(x)] have the same sets of solutions. (c) Show that the problems max f(x) and max g[f(x)] have the same first-order necessary and second-order sufficient conditions. (d) Prove that for any function f(x) and any strictly increasing function g(y), the problems max g[f(x)] and min - f(x) have the same sets of solutions. (e) Show that the problems max g[f(x)] and min - f(x) have the same first-order necessary and second-order sufficient conditions.    Consider the algorithm (1): r_(n+1) = c*r_n*M + (1-c)*v where: r_n is a row vector; c is a scalar such that 0 0; and the other variables are as before.  Can we claim that (3) converges (Perhaps, again due to spectral radius)?And, if we can, how does the limit compare with the stationary distribution of (2)?

      A week from Thursday my father is undergoing 2 operations to fix his broken heart. He is growing weaker by the day and admitted to me tonight that the 2 minutes it takes him to shave in the morning leaves him feeling completely winded.  How difficult it has been to watch him grow weak before my eyes, this man who has always been as strong as an ox, as healthy as a horse -- this man who never took a sick day in his life (or even an aspirin, for that matter). How frustrating it has been to hear him insist that he knows better than the specialists, to hear him refuse treatment, to know that he is living in the land of denial -- while his heart muscle grew weaker and weaker. And how painful it has been to answer the phone to my mother's tearful cries, fearful she will be a widow if he keeps refusing the operations needed to restore him to health.  Actually, I misspoke above. I do remember one day (and one day only) that my father called in sick to work. And it was not because he was sick. It was because he went to feed our goldfish on his way out the door one morning and discovered that my sister's goldfish had jumped out of the tank and was barely alive on the dining room carpet. Mind you, he never wanted those fish. When I was 5, my sister and I begged for goldfish. He said no. So he was less than thrilled to arrive home from work one summer day to learn that my mother went and bought 2 goldfish anyway. My sister and I quickly lost interest in those fish, but not my Dad. He came to love them and I will never forget the sad look in his eyes that morning Sunshine jumped out of the tank. He spent the whole day nursing that fish and moving her back and forth in the water, trying to force air in her gills, but in the end he couldn't save her. But he did make sure she was was laid to rest in a proper burial under the buckeye tree my uncle Bert planted in our backyard when he was a boy.  I could write all night about the kindness of my father's heart and the gentleness of his soul -- about all of the stray animals he let us keep, about how he visited my grandfather every single day at the nursing home until his death, about how the first thing he did the moment he walked into the house from work was play with his 3 daughters -- but it is late and I need to be getting to bed.  Thank goodness after a month of my family begging and pleading and fighting with him, my father has listened to reason and has decided to go ahead with treatment. So I await August 26th with nervousness and hope. We have been told he will feel like a new man when the operations are completed. But I don't want a new man. I like the old one just fine and I am anxious to have him back.

      As a child, I loved going with my mother to the beauty shop when she would get her hair done. I'd sit and watch the old ladies get their hair teased as the smell of hair spray and smoke (remember when everyone smoked in beauty shops?) choked me.  As I sat getting my hair done today, I marveled at how beauty shops have evolved. They seem more serene and relaxing and mellow these days. The place where I go is actually a spa. Oh, how I love having my hair done. I almost fell asleep when Veronica was shampooing and conditioning my hair.  Had my 2-yr old. daughter not thrown a fit when I left this morning, clinging to my leg and begging me not to go, I might even have stayed for a manicure and massage (but not a pedicure -- can't stand those -- too ticklish). There is nothing like some good pampering, not to mention the free warm chocolate chip cookies they always have (and I only ate 3 today).  My mother commented that my hair still looks long, even after my trim, and suggested I consider lopping it all off since my birthday is right around the corner and I'll be closer to 40 than 30.  No thanks, Mom. Not ready for the rat tease just yet. I like my big hair just fine and after all, I live in Texas where everything is bigger.

      How I survived 9 months (twice) with no sushi is a complete and utter miracle. It feels so heavenly to be able to eat it again. We had it for dinner tonight and it was delish, especially because we washed it down with warm Sake. Yum. We got spicy tuna, California and Philadelphia rolls, flying fish eggs, salmon and yellowtail along with miso soup.  When I was preggers I would fill a small bowl with soy sauce and add a huge wad of wasabe and then drink it. It was a weak substitute, but satisfied the craving nonetheless. (Hey, we do what we have to)!  Now it's time to make good on my promise from last night. Treadmill, here I come.

      Give me time to work on my math problems and I am a happy girl.  I've been working on a problem in Number Theory off and on called "the Collatz Conjecture" aka "the 3X + 1 problem".Let f(x) be a function defined on the positive integers such that: f(x) = x/2 if x is evenf(x) = (3*x+1)/2 if x is odd Then the conjecture is: iterates of f(x) will eventually reach 1 for anyinitial value of x. Various cash prizes have been offered for the proofor disproof of this conjecture.  urlLink http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/math99/math99009.htm   This site here is really cool:   urlLink http://www.uccs.edu/~asoifer/olympiad.html

      I had a date tonight, but I stood him up and now I feel guilty. I had every intention of getting sweaty with my treadmill tonight, but by the time I got done cleaning the house, walking the dog, consoling a teething baby, returning a phone call and opening the mail it was midnight. And despite the fact that we were together 2 other nights this week, I was really looking forward to tonight because we usually watch Designing for the Sexes together on HGTV on Thursdays.  Oh well, he knows I am bound and determined not to neglect him. We have been thru 50 pounds together and only have another 2 to go. Tomorrow is another day and I promised him I'd give him extra attention to make up for tonight.

      "What do you want to be when you grow up, Olivia?" I asked my 2.5 yr. old daughter last week. Smiling, she replied, "A baseball." I paused, waiting for the word "player" to come out of her mouth next, but when it didn't I asked, "You mean you want to be a baseball  player  when you grow up?" "No, mommy," she said forcefully, "I want to be a baseball when I grow up." Barely able to keep from laughing I said, "Well Olivia, you will make one awesome baseball." She smiled, very satisfied and added, "And you will be a butterfly when you grow up, Mommy."  Of all of the things that Olivia and I do together -- tea parties, dress-up, painting, reading, bubble blowing, block towers, puzzles -- my favorite thing is to just sit down on the floor and talk to her. Olivia was an early talker and has quite the vocabulary. And I am continually amazed and astonished at the insights and thoughts she shares with me.  Yesterday, Dr. Olivia and Nurse Mommy were playing hospital with all of her stuffed animals. Dr. Olivia asked me to get the thermometer out of the medicine chest. With an air of urgency she placed it in the mouth of Tanny the Dog before proclaiming that Tanny was sick with a fever of 72.5 and the croup.  In the most Marlo Thomas-Free-To-Be-You-and-Me voice I could muster I said, "Olivia, you can be anything you want to be when you grow up, even a doctor." She stood up, put her hands on her hips and said emphatically, "No Mommy, I will be a baseball when I grow up. And you will be a butterfly."  I smiled and said, "Olivia honey, I don't know what either of us will be when we grow up, but I do know that I will still be your Mommy." Giggling, she put her little arms around my neck and said, "Good."

      I have always loved going grocery shopping. It was a big deal in our house. We went on Saturday mornings and it meant that my sisters and I each got to choose a Hostess goody and a bottle of pop. This was before the plastic 2-liter bottle era -- back when people used to return glass pop bottles for casherooni. (Oy, I am dating myself).  With the exception of the occasional Ho-Ho and Ding-Dong, could anything be better than Suzy-Q's?  I think not!  And did anyone ever really buy and eat those gross pink, coconut-covered Snoball things? Yeech. Not in my family.  I have fond memories of shaking every Italian salad dressing bottle I could reach and ballet dancing down the aisles. When my sister was little, she would sit in the front seat of the cart and we would "cruise" down the aisles. I would cover her eyes and tell her we were flying to the moon -- and I'd find an empty aisle and run down it as fast as I could and then jump up on the cart and away we would go.  Tonight I took my own daughters to the grocery store. I think my kids find it as magical as I did. Samantha is just a baby, but is mesmerized by all of the lights and bright colors. And Olivia has her favorite routines, too, like getting a choc. chip cookie at the bakery counter, hanging out by the lobster tank and charming the deli dude into giving her some roast beef.  Yeah, my daughters had fun at old Tom Thumb tonight and so did I -- especially because my Twinings Sunset Rose Tea was finally restocked and I discovered a new cereal....Reese's Puffs -- like Cocoa Puffs, only Reese's. Yum.  And when no one was looking, I grabbed a bottle of Wish Bone Italian and shook it to my heart's content. Ah, simple pleasures.

      It's good to see the Dow up so strong today. The past few weeks have seen a dip again and I tire of seeing my investments decline. I manage my family's investments now. I used to have a broker, but all of his picks were duds so I dumped him and started using Ameritrade. I have done much better investing our money than he ever did. Last I heard he was filing bankruptcy. How sad is that?  I remember my Grandma Ralph (her name was Rose, but we never called her that) telling me from the early age of 7 that I should start saving for retirement. My sisters and I would nod, but deep down we questioned this wisdom. But, as with so many other things that she told us, we look back now and realize Grandma Ralph was right.  Oh Earl, I do miss her.

      So here it is, my very first blog entry. I am officially on my lunch hour right now and am eating some succulent Japanese food and trying to force down some vegetables. If I never ate another veggie, I wouldn't miss them. Meat is where it's at -- it's beyond me how anyone can be a vegetarian.
