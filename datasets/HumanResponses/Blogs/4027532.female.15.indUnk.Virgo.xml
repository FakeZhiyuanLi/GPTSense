      New kitty! oh my god! Apparently it is going to be named Samo. But no one seems to want that. I think its better than its original name of Owl. The people named it that because they thought it looked like an owl. How the hell can a cat be an owl? It is a cat! A cat! Stupid Idots surround me(Anything that you don't understand or seems stupid, ridiculous, etc. is most likely an inside joke. because i'm stupid like that). I hate my dog. My plan is to get rid of Scooby (little dumbass dog) and then get a rottweiler or something. Scooby has corrupted my other dog and made it a stupid little dumbass dog too. Hell with it! I just need to get rid of both of my dogs and replace them with rottweilers. How the hell do you spell rottweiler? Don't you hate that suspicious feeling of stupidity that you get when you think you spelled something wrong? Cat needs better name. Must think. I need help on this. It's a black cat with three white spots, one on its neck and two on its stomach. If anyone even bothers to read the first sentence of this or even all the way to this point they are going to tell me immediately a good name. But I am expecting absolutely no feedback on this, due to my stupidity.

      Exciting! I have a fetish with cows, just in case anyone was wondering. I think everyone has some kind of fetish or obsession. With most people it's the opposite sex or sex. Those are the most common obsessions but then you get your eccentric cow people like me. I'm not as desperate as the rest of you I suppose or maybe it's because only loser-guys are attracted to me. I'm just not gorgeous or slutty enough to attract the guys I like. So I'm forced to be obsessed with cows. I'm so pathetic. The best I can hope for is that I made some loser-guy laugh with this.

      My kitty's name is Gustav! He sounds French or something. This town is so boring there is pretty much nothing to do... except for go to Blink182 concerts!!! I went Friday at the fair and it was crazy! But it was so great! I love Blink182! Anyways, on to less interesting topics. Because there's really not much you can say about the concert. I mean yay it was Blink182 so obviously it was great. And there's not much more to say because that would be the high point of my night, the rest sucked. I was there with just my brother, his girlfriend, and two other girls a year older than me.  I always ended up alone. And there wasn't really anyone to talk to because the other two girls weren't there half the time and they thought I was crazy. I am crazy but in a normal way, not like seriously. I'm more like stupid than crazy. I keep Pulling Georgias(blond moments).
