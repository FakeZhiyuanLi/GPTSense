      We all watched the story of  urlLink Igor Fokin , a puppeteer street performer in Harvard Square.  It was featured on Art Close Up on  urlLink  WGBH .  It was one of the first programs to be taped on our wonderful cable DVR, and was viewed a total of 6 times already!  Adam was enthralled by the magical puppets and scared by the skeletons.  He kept talking about the mouse dying, when it was just a metaphor for Igor dying at the young age of 36 (it is always considered young when they are younger than you).  Doug and I were saddened that such a passionate, talented artist had passed before we could have seen him.  We will be sure to look for his memorial, the funny guy (or the mouse as Adam sees it), on the traffic pillar next time we go to Harvard Square.  His favorite store - Everything for a Dollar.  As for the puppets, he just "lends them a hand".

      When President Reagan was elected, I was only 12 years old.  My first reaction was that he was going to ruin my teenage years being President.  I thought he was a complete buffoon, an actor, and I couldn't see how people thought his oratory was so persuasive.  Every time he spoke, I would just roll my eyes and say - what a joke, is this man a simpleton or what?  Deficits and Star Wars, the country will run into the ground!!  Now that I am much older, tolerance and understanding do come.  I am especially impressed with his visionary economic policy.  He really did turn the economy around, producing more competitive companies and killing inflation to this day (although I am alarmed that the price of a gallon of milk just went up to $3.49 at my local store!!).  It took a lot of guts and determination to pull it off.  Never mind the sheer vision and genius.  His foreign policy staging (was Star Wars just a bluff to push the Soviet Union over the edge?) helped to lead the end of the cold war.  I remember when the Berlin wall came down, I thought, great, it will go down in history as happening under President George (H.W.) Bush, when in fact, communism just crumbled under its own weight.  Bush, in that case, was a bystander in that event, not the cause, but the crumbling was not just from internal forces, US policy did affect it.  When I think back on Reagan, I remember that he was always smiling.  Before, I thought he was just stupid and happy.  Now I realize that he did inspire the country with his optimism.  Not me at the time, I was already a bitter realist.  Maybe I would enjoy him better now.  Of course I will never agree with any of the social views of the right, especially when it comes to women (choice choice choice) and science (please use all those discarded embryos at fertility clinics for stem cells), but they do have a better handle on economic issues.  Do I think that years from now, I won't have the disdain that I do for President George W. Bush?  We'll see, time will tell.  It's amazing how your views can change.  6/27/04 - Oh wait, Iran-Contra, how quickly we forget!! 7/07/04 - Ketchup as a vegetable, another good one!!

      Sleeping with someone you love can create such a feeling of peace and happiness.  It is one of the most wonderful things that you can share with someone.  When you have a family, there are so many loved ones that can snuggle with.  Adam has gotten into the habit of having Daddy fall asleep with him in his bed.  Recently he has gotten in the habit of sleeping in all of our beds in the house!!  I also end up sleeping in all different beds.  When I wake up, I'm sometimes confused.. Where am I? How did I get here? and most often - What time is it?  I think I am happier sticking to one bed.  Less confusion and more peaceful sleep.  One night, Adam climbed in with me and Dova when I was nursing her in our bed close to his bedtime.  Daddy climbed in on the other side and we were one big sandwich family (Doug, Adam, Dova, me).  It was truly a happy family bed.  When I awoke, I took a picture, but of course, I had to get out to do it.  Later I had to carry Adam's 38 pounds up the stairs and into his bed.  The next night, I nursed Dova upstairs in her room and Adam fell asleep with us again.  It is really wonderful sleeping with your children except for the arm thrashing and head butting.  I carried him back to his room again, put Dova in her crib, and went back to my own bed.  These days, we are all sleeping in the right place.  When you think about the evolution of humans, we certainly didn't all have separate rooms and beds!!  But it is the norm and for the most part lends itself to better sleep.  There is something very special about sleeping with a baby, especially one who is still nursing.  Many nights I have woken up with Dova nursing next to me, sometimes she had been nursing for 3 or 4 hours straight!!  It is a lot harder to respond to the baby monitor and lug myself up the stairs in the middle of the night to nurse her.  I love to snuggle with her for the rest of the night like when she was a newborn, but for the most part I lug myself back downstairs and snuggle with my mister :).

       urlLink    I just had some of Mama's milk for a snack and I feel very happy, sleepy, warm and content.  Mmmm, it's comforting to suck on my lip.  Do I see Mama looking at me through my half closed eyes?  She takes good care of me, I always feel loved and secure.  Adam is sure making a lot of noise with his Mach V, but that's ok, I'm getting very close to dreamland..  zzz

      I just finished listening to Spalding Gray's monologue  Monster in a Box .  It is the only thing that I actually purchased from  urlLink Audible.com  (a whole $10.95).  I figured that it was worth purchasing, as the audio version is the more pure form of this work and as opposed to a mere book reading.  Besides, I had already read the monster,  Impossible Vacation , years ago.  Although the audio was pretty poor, it was still fun to listen to.  It was funny of course, and full of his Rhode Island accent (a mix between New York and New England with a lisp on top of it).  I only wish they had all his monologues on Audible!!  Some parts of this monologue were so funny, that my mouth hurt from smiling and laughing so much.  I wonder if anyone saw this crazy, happy woman walking her baby and listening to her Palm.  It was really funny when he described being cast for the stage manager in the play  Our Town , and he said, "Get Garrison Keillor."  Just happened to be reading  Lake Wobegon Days  right now as well.  Talk about a totally disparate monologist (more on a future post).  There were also premonitory but funny lines like, "His insanity was leaking into mine."  I kept thinking about his ill-fated battle with depression and untimely death.  Nonetheless, he was a genius at expressing his experiences, neuroses and views from the edge of sanity.  It is so unfortunate that he is no longer with us.

      I happened upon these while pregnant with Dova, which reminded me of my wonderful breastfeeding days with Adam and let me look forward to the days to come with Dova.  Here is  urlLink At My Breast  and  urlLink Milklight .  My friend Jennifer called the poems pornographic(!!), even though she was an avid breastfeeder herself.    These come from Mothering.com, website of a crunchy granola magazine.  My first Mothering magazine was given to me by a nurse in my OB's office.  After she interviewed me and gave me all the other usual materials, she must have determined that I was sufficiently crunchy and specifically went back to fetch this magazine.  I think it was because I knew the Stonyfield yogurt line intimately (Chocolate Underground) and I knew before she did that they had switched to the 6oz size from the 8oz.  Also the fact that I breastfed Adam for 16 months.  The magazine is about natural parenting, with "vaccines are bad" attitude and cloth diapers (no thank you!!).  Although it is completely leftist propaganda (I am not THAT liberal), I still subscribe to the newsletter for an interesting article or two and the poems.  6/22/04 - I just found another one,  urlLink A Mother's Nature .

      Doug took his motorcycle to work this morning and left my car outside of the garage.  Asked Adam whether he wanted to take the green car without realizing that my car was already out.  When we went outside, I told him that we had to take the grey car since it was already outside.  Adam had a fit and insisted on taking the green car.  It was quite a struggle getting him into the grey car, he was completely hysterical.  It is one thing forcing a 18 month old into the car, but by the time they are 3.5, you'd think they could be more cooperative.  Didn't want to scare the neighbors by the way I was yelling, had to threaten a spanking, and he had already had a time-out earlier for driving his motorcycles on the walls.  Finally drove to school, but he did not calm down.  Kept crying and screaming the whole way.  Half way there, he said he wanted his burpies and his baby (doll).  When we got close to school, he said he wanted to go home and didn't want to go to school.  Pulled into the lot and told him that we were not going home and he had to calm down.  Had to stand outside of the car because I just couldn't take the screaming.  Of course, baby Dova starts crying as well.  I waited for 15 minutes for him to calm down, and he wouldn't.  He refused hugs, he refused to calm down.  Wanted to go home to get his burpies and his baby.  I told him that if we had to go home I would be very angry.  Of course the days of Kathy's house (family daycare) I would just drag him inside and leave him.  Now, with preschool, I have to leave him as a happy boy or else they would cry abuse.  I finally had to get back into the car and drive home.  As soon as we started to head back home, he calmed down.  Left him in the car while I got the burpies and the baby and he finally smiled when he got them.  I was still livid.  I kept lecturing about how he has to listen when I say we are taking the grey car, and that we would never ever drive home again after we get to school.  He was all sweet and "yes, mama".  I gave him lots of hugs and kisses when we got to school, he was still a bit clingy.  Finally, I was able to leave him.  I was so exhausted from screaming and yelling at him (and calculating the amount of fuel I wasted driving back and forth.. at $2.299/G it is about 9 cents per mile x 7 miles = $.63, I guess that wasn't so bad), that I didn't go to the store and get food for Doug's birthday party on Sunday.  Another time, now back to work...

      After zipping through 12 books during my maternity leave with Dova (one was 800 pages!!), I slowly plodded through Garrison Keillor's&nbsp;first book&nbsp; Lake Wobegon Days .&nbsp; I assumed this was going to be a great book since I love his monologues on   urlLink Prairie Home Companion  .&nbsp; I always check out the reviews on  urlLink Amazon &nbsp;first before reading a book, and was surprised to see that is was split between raves and boos.&nbsp; Dullsville?&nbsp; All those great stories on the radio aren't boring!!   Unfortunately, I would have to agree with the latter bunch.&nbsp; It was a slow read, I'm not sure whether it was because of my hectic schedule going back to work, or because I put it in the upstairs bedroom (downstairs is reserved for my Time magazine addition).&nbsp; Plus I just didn't like his style and tone.&nbsp; Some parts of the book were just slow and not interesting, full of details and mundane happenings that I just couldn't&nbsp;get myself to care about.&nbsp; Then there would be really funny gems, but he rushed through them instead of taking his time building them up like he does during the monologue.&nbsp; And then there was the really bitter undercurrent which you can sense about his upbringing towards his parents and religion.&nbsp; There was a section of footnotes that lasted a whole chapter which was just a distracting way&nbsp;to read (I read the long footnote, which was full of the bitter resentments, and then I had to go back and read the main text, which was simply unmemorable, almost just filler so that he could write a really long footnote).   I guess from now on, I will stick to the audio monologues.

      The Dryer vs. Air-Conditioning.  In an attempt at good environmental and attachment parenting practices, I strapped Dova onto my back and brought a load of laundry out to hang on our new clothesline.  At first I was smiling at what a good doobie I was, bonding with my baby, enjoying the outdoors, although it was kinda warm, and saving the environment by not using the electric dryer.  I stopped to admire the cute baby clothes and wonderful patterns made by the towels.  I brought out the wood drying rack onto the deck (no underwear and bras go on the line for public view!!) and clipped each sock and burpie.    But by the end, I was sweating like crazy, and then the rack blew over onto Dova (scared me more than anything) and there were TOO MANY SOCKS!!!  When everything was finally hung, I was so relieved to go inside and enjoy the comfortable central A/C.  It was fantastic.  So much for saving the environment.  I dropped Dova into her exersaucer to cool off too.  So much for attachment parenting!!  I looked at the outdoor thermometer - it was 87°F + humid, what the heck was I thinking?!?!  This was the original  urlLink article  that inspired me to get a clothes line.

      OK, it's such a cool toy, and of course it was invented by an MIT person, but does it save you time?  I just spent a good 15 minutes trying to get all the hair out from the roller (since I am in the post pregnancy massive hair fallout stage).  Plus you have to clean all those nooks and crannies that collect the dust (why they couldn't get the dust to just go to the collection bin is beyond me).  You never clean out a regular vacuum, although it would probably be wise to (I don't even want to think about how much hair is in that roller, I guess I will wait till it stops working to check).  It is mostly fun as a neat toy, Adam loves to start it up and watch it (even Dova is fascinated by it).  It is definitely nice for under the bed and couches, but it can be frustrating to watch when it misses the obvious stuff.  Unfortunately I was just a month too early when I bought mine, or else I would've gotten the one with the remote control!!

      NPR again.. Here is the audio  urlLink clip .  Fred Child claims that Segovia was actually not a good technician when it came to his performance.  Chords buzz, strings squeak, but now players are getting beyond the mechanics of playing the guitar and so you only hear the music.  Jason Vieaux and David Russell are some of the new stars.  Melissa Block is still skeptical.  I agree.  Segovia single handedly brought the guitar into the mainstream classical music arena.  And it was not only by his playing, but by his charismatic personality.  Plus, if you take too much out of the sound of the guitar, you might as well just use a synthesizer.  Yesterday morning, I heard the Netherlands Bach Society perform the Bach Brandenburg Concerto No. 4 on a WGBH recorded performance.  Now, this performance was wild and passionate, full of squeaky violins and flailing arms (you can almost hear it).  It was just too much.  Bach is one of those composers who created pure music, and I would rather hear just the music and not so much of the killing chickens (as we used to call young violin players practicing).

      I heard this story on NPR about ghost hunters (listen to the short audio  urlLink clip ). Jake Warga went to help a family that was hearing strange noises in their house.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ghost (purportedly) turned out to be was the late great grandmother of their 2 year old son.&nbsp; The new mom was overwhelmed and uneasy about being in a new town without support.&nbsp; The grandmother was "needed" to watch over the boy and he would often say "hi" and "bye" to her.&nbsp; Once the mom was more secure, the ghost went away, she was no longer "needed".&nbsp; &nbsp;  Jake said was that young children often are able to talk about ghosts and their former lives.&nbsp; He said you should ask them, "Do you remember when you were big?"&nbsp; I asked Adam (who thinks he is a big boy already), if he remembered when he was big.&nbsp; He said, "Yes, I remember I pooped and winkled in the potty."&nbsp; I asked him again if he remembered when we was big like Mommy and Daddy and what did he do?&nbsp; He said yes, but couldn't tell me what he did.&nbsp; Maybe he is just beyond the age already.&nbsp; I've asked him if remembers being born, sometimes he says yes, sometimes no.&nbsp; But I will try to ask him again.&nbsp; Perhaps when he is going to sleep.

      It was an awesome night of public television.  The same night I first saw Igor Fokin,  urlLink Great Performances  had Keeping Score: MTT on Music/Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 4.  Of course I did not bother with the actual performance of the 4th, since I've heard it so many times, but the documentary was totally enlightening, especially since I consider that I know a good deal about classical music.  I guess I didn't know about professional orchestras and performances.  I first remember learning about Michael Tilson Thomas when I was a teenager.  He was one of those up and coming young conductors, and kind of cute to boot.  Soon after, I learned that he was gay and flamboyantly so.  Oh well.  My first thought on seeing him in this broadcast was, "Gee, he looks really old, and not so cute!"  After doing some research on him after seeing the show, I determined that he was 59, so maybe he wasn't so young after all during my teens.  (When I was 14 at Tanglewood, he would have been 36).  The cool things I learned from the show were that the librarian transfers all the notes that the conductor puts into his score onto each individual part.  The tympanist prepared his skins in a kiddy pool in a shower.  The oboists spends half his time preparing his reeds (they show the process right from the first split of the cylinder into four parts), and the other half practicing, so they only get to practice half as much as the other players.  The poor piccolo player really sweats the 21 note 3 second solo.  There were also many quotes that hit home like, "Music memory is like smell.  When you hear a piece of music, it can take you right back to when you first heard it."  So very true, whether it is classical or popular.  And I was really impressed by his beautiful house in San Francisco.  Absolutely breathtaking.  All the scenes were beautifully shot as well.  Oh yes, and all his cool commentary about the music.  So fitting that he chose Tchaikovsky, a fellow gay that led a tortured life (as opposed to MTT, who looked pretty darn happy).

      You can tell when you leave the idealistic days of youth by your attitude towards air conditioning. When I got my first car (my beloved 318i), I got it in white, partially to keep the car cooler in the summertime and not use the A/C so much. I would watch outside temp and would only turn it on when it was 90°F or higher. It was my way of sucking it up and saving the environment. Besides, it was more natural, why shouldn't I be happy with the environment that nature provides, we do live in the "temperate" zone after all, not the tropics, not even Texas or Florida!!  So when it was warm, I would open the sunroof and the windows and enjoy the breeze. I never understood why my parents would always use the A/C in the car instead of opening the windows. The 90° cutoff temperature for the A/C quickly dropped down to 80°, not so extreme. And I was happy with that for 8 years or so. Then the kids came. It started when I was pregnant, and after hearing that you always feel hot while you are pregnant. We installed central A/C in the house, and I was comfortable at home in the summer for the first time in a long time.  It may be the protective instinct to make babies as comfortable as possible, after all, they cannot regulate their temperatures as well as adults. When I drove Adam as a baby, the A/C went on as soon he started sweating. And that would happen quickly, often by the time it reached 77° outside. Now driving Dova, the A/C goes on immediately at the sign of heat and humidity, even as low as 69°!!  Plus the amount of additional gas that gets used while the A/C runs in the car is minimal (of course I know from my detailed mileage spreadsheet)!!  Now that I think back, I always did have A/C growing up. Room air conditioners in the apartments, central in the house, a room air conditioner in my dorm room (certainly not everyone had that!!), and every car since I was 4 had it!! Only recently did we live with only one room air conditioner in the house until the central (and a few years we didn't even install it - what dummies!). So was I spoiled or justifiably pampered as I am doing so with my kids?  Adam is really spoiled, he even as central A/C in his preschool.  Now we always say that the central A/C is the best thing we ever did for the house. I realize now that it is not a crime to be comfortable!! It is nice not to be grumpy from the heat. Everyone in the house benefits when it is comfortable. We all deserve to be comfortable if we can.  I always said that there is so much trouble in the Middle East because it is too darn hot!!

      It finally pays off to have two kids. After a hectic night of greasy chinese take-out food everywhere, Doug disappears back into the garage to work on putting a short throw shifter into my car (which is awesome, thanks!). The kids need all sorts of attention, so I run through Adam's nighttime routine (potty, pajamas, brushing teeth, 3 stories) while Dova is fussy on our bed below. I was at my wits end with such a mess in the kitchen, so I put Adam and Dova together in our bed and told them to keep each other company and go to sleep. Adam complained that Dova wasn't sleepy (she was flailing her arms and legs around), but I said don't worry, she will fall asleep. I went back to the kitchen and started the massive cleanup - counters, stools, floors, dishes, etc. After about 15 minutes, it was quiet. I peeked in the bedroom and both of them were snuggled together asleep. They actually kept each other company without my help. It was so sweet :-). I carried them back up to their own rooms.  It ended up being a night of musical beds as well. Since Adam fell asleep on our bed, he woke up in the middle of the night and climbed back into our bed. Then a short while later, I heard Dova on the baby monitor and went to her room, and fed her and fell asleep with her.  (this draft was from 6/27.. finally getting around to completing it!!)
