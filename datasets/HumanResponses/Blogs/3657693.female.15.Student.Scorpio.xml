      I've decided to write another blog as u want to call it tonight. It's almost midnight. I've been thinking all day, and just random stuff is on my mind, how people these days in our world that we live in people are so pathetic, even me at times. People are becomming selfish more and more each day. Everyone wants the best but its like a race who can get the best the first, and while these people are trying and strugging to get what they want along their path they hurt people that don't deserve to be hurt. It just bothers me when I sit here or I'm out some where watchin how people these days including I are being so selfish. What is this world comming to...I love so many people, and I don't think i show it in any good way, i try my best but sumtimes it seems not good enugh...sumtimes, i feel as if i shouldn't be here, like whut is my use on being here? i get judge in so many ways and seen to do things but sumtimes cant succeed. my question is if love is suppose to be filled with happiness how come to many people get hurt by it? i you think about it...you get hurt anyway...lifes to confusing.. this is all i reelie got to say...  .:unoticed:.

      so here I am, alone not very surprise at that one. you put all your trust in some people thinkin' you're all real good friends but down the road u get stabed in the back. from just this summer i have lost half of my friends, which i figured were my real best friends but, because of lil things getting in the way because i have made a few mistakes in my time and possibly accidently re-doin'these mistakes that people are just willing to throw me way.it's like i have to be all perfect to be there friends everyone makes mistakes but when i make a mistake its like whoaaaaa kind've thing.but after all we've been through as friends it seems in my perspective that I wasn't appreciated that much that i can be just thrown away. when good things start to happen it just goes down hill from the start. I tried to be a good friend towards sombody who i thought was a good friend in return, but end up that they weren't,but being that good friend got me being shut down and broken into two. I got taken for granteed of for being a good friend and lost my chance at sumthing so the other person got a free way towards it. which is stupid since, if u just want to prove ur over an ex-lover or so you don't feel lonely, shows to me that they just care bout themselves and not a friend that was trying to be the bestest which just turned back around and slapped me in the face. As the summer slowly ends i end up realizing more about life. . shouldn't trust anyone in the world anymore. I learned who my friends were and which are not. majority who my friends arent. this summer has been the most gayest summer ever. And i hope all the people that have hurt me and just thrown me away are happy. becuz now I'm here alone unhappy. which i guess i deserve to be since, worst stuff keeps happening day by day, week by week.  real friends, i bet, i bet. . . you've lost me. . .  tiff...

      today is tuesssssday. I didn't do much today. I went to the movies with the usual people(kristy embo poeta) we saw harold and kumar go to whitecastle. It was a pretty random movie! lol. hmm Ive been thinking...and maybe things will get better. I might not have everything I want but I've been going through aload of shit and I guess I'm learning through all the mistakes and becomming stronger. who knows...but I guess whatever God puts me through he'll get me out of it too...understand? lol my years been shit but I must just be paitent and wait for that sumthing good that happens...things will be changing for me since I am moving and it's like...a new begining. hopefully things will get greater. in the words of streetlight... a better place a better time.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A better place a better time  streetlight manifestO!   and so she wakes up in time to break down she left a note up on the dresser and she's right on time you don't know anything right or wrong i say i know and she says so i want to panic but i've had it so i go  (you don't owe anything to anyone)  but don't take your life becuase it's all you've got you'd be better off just up and leaving if you don't think they will stop  and when you wake up, everything is going to be fine i guarantee that you wake in a better place in a better time so you're tired of living and you feel that you might give in well don't it's not your time   flipping through the paper today looking for a specific page don't want to find her full name followed by dates because when i left her alone she made a sound, like a moan "you're known by everyone for everything you've done" fuck buying flowers for graves i'd rather buy you a one way non-stop to anywhere, find anyone do anything, forget and start again, love she said she won't go and that's that it hurts too much to stand by you've got to stop and draw a line and everyone here has to choose a side tonight the moment of truth is haunting you don't forget your family regardless of what you choose to do. you cant decide and they're all screaming "why won't you?" i'll start the engine but i can't take this ride for you i'll draw the bath and i'll load your gun but i hope so hard that you bathe and hunt.  annie's tired of forgetting about today and always planning for tomorrow annie says "the saddest day i came across was when i learned that life goes on without me" annie says "if everyone has someone else, then i ain't got nobody's love to save me" annie says "i think i'll pass away tonight, because it seems i'll never get it right if it's just me"   and when you wake up everything's going to be fine  i guarantee that you'll wake in a better place in a better time.  so you're tired of living and you feel like you might give in, well don't. it's not your time.  annie says she wouldn't mind if they never find a cure for all her problems. annie says as long as she has someone near to make it clear she does not need to solve them "oh this loneliness is killing me it's filling me with anger and resentment i'm turning into someone that i never thought i'd have to be again"   and even if it was i wouldn't let you go you could run run run run but i will follow close someday you will say "that's it, that's all" but i'll be waiting there with open arms to break your fall i know that you think that you are on your own but just know that i am here and i'll lead you home if you let me she said forget me but i can't  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  take care

      It has been a while since I've updated my blog. Since I came back alot has been going on. As I retell the story to many other people i get the same comment from each "you have so much drama in your life" and it's true. I cant quite understand what's going on. This year hs been nothing but constant changing in everything thats been going on around me. The people u hanged out with not even 3 months ago are gone...things are gettin harder for me everyday. You have ur good friends or u have ur fake friends. Im sure i have a couple real friends but lately ur not sure who to trust. everything is changing. I guess i have to wait to see the best that comes out of this. But for those who don't talk to me nemore or refuse to be even friends anymore becuz of stupid pathetic lil fights and will drop a friendship for all weve done for one another than i guess u can get ur way. hopefully you'll have a better time. I have nothing more to say......  -tiffaniee. . .
