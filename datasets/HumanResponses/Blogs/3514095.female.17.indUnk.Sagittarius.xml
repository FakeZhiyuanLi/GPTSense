      something happened between me and seph last nyt..i misunderstood what he said..kala ko he was guna break up with me na...STUPID ME! i cried na kaya un..nasama ata ung brain cells ko sa luha ko kaya d ka naintindihan sinabi niya. i felt so stupid to have thought that. now it has became an issue already. an issue of trust..an issue of breaking up (and making up)..an issue if I still believe in our relationship. DAMMIT. breaking up with him would be the biggest mistake i would ever do... hurting him would be the biggest sin i would never forgive myself for doing... i mean, i love him so much... it never occurred to me that id be the one to call it off. alam ko he's getting tired of all my whining and mga pandadrama...ano ba naman kasi ako!! i dnt know why im being like this all of a sudden!its not me at all! dala ba to ng viral infection na meron ako??... i feel so guilty..he's been so nice and understanding to me..pero ako?kulang pa rin... i guess i am the problem. i have the problem. ~~im sorry seph...;(

      i know a lot of people are thinking why i chose love over friendship... in the first place i knew the situation i was into was not right at all. we both knew that. but it was just too hard to resist. LOVE hit us really HARD. i knew we'd get into trouble. i knew people would give us that awful look. i knew i would hurt people in the way. i knew friends would raise their eyebrows and say,"..what a b****!". i knew all of these would welcome us if WE follow what we both feel. People who are in love tend to blind themselves from all of these.People, like me, would risk it all just to prove to everyone that "hey i really love this person.." something a martyr or a saint would do. but im not worthy to be called a saint. i risked it all because i knew it would be worth it. i knew whatever happens my friends would try to understand me (thanx for those who did..). i knew HE would never leave me and we'd get through it all. We did actually but it cost us a lot. i lost a friend, a dear friend. i lost some of my friends' trust. i lost the "goody-goody" image i once had(in school).but im not totally regretting to have lost my image. hello??!im only human. i make mistakes. and im tired of having to sport an image that would later be my downfall (if you know what i mean). i also have an "evil side" you know.but i dont want to dwell on that. it was one hell of a typhoon,not just for me, but for the both of us. the time where i wanted to give up (give him up) never came . NEVER. i was ready to recieve "proper sanction" for whatever 'violation' that i did. he was there for me all the way... that's why i survived it. i knew that,what i was fighting for was worth it.

      im looking forward to going to school next week..hay.. new life. bagong buhay na talaga ako. been doing a lot of thinking lately and naisip ko ang dame kong naging mistakes in the past na ngayon ko lang narerealize. i admit it. i became too proud of myself. yung tipong i dnt care anymore. i dnt care if i will hurt sum1 in the way or what pipol would think of me. it wasn't me. hindi talaga ako ganun. lately ko lng naisip yun..naalala ko before hindi ako "palaban". ung tipong lalaban sa iba...i observed na i changed. i became strong in a way na sinisira ko ang sarili ko. one thing i rily regret the most is to have hurt my "bestfriend" or should i say my friend...i guess other people know who she is.. we were the best of friends before..but things changed.. naiiyak ako pag naiisip ko un mga foolish things na ginawa ko jus to have it my way...ung mga bagay na nasaktan ko siya..ung mga bagay na nag sira ng "already-broken-friendship" namin..i miss having her as a "close friend". now that i've lost her, there are a lot of things that i wasn't able to tell her..i wanted to ask for forgiveness in person kayalang there's no way we could meet...i just wish she'd forgive me,totally and that her feeling would heal. (if YOU're reading this,it's not "showbiz" talk...)if only time would unwind itself...

      ~~ this song is for some i really miss right now and im sure im going to miss more in the next couple of days..  It feels like a lifetime, A thousand days have passed by Since I held you close to me If I could see that smile from my friend I know that I could live again I need you here with me  Heaven knows what to say Even though for right Now you're so far away I hope and I pray Somewhere in your heart I'll always stay  boy, lately my sun doesn't shine without you Never noticed what it feels like to be without you Feels like I took my last step And my last breath in my life ending Had to say just what I was feeling,boy 'cause my sun doesn't shine, Sun doesn't shine without you  This is more for me than for you Boy, I finally see there's no substitute For what we have Do you know how much I love you  And what we share I can't forget Boy a love like yours I'll never let just slip away Just promise that you'll stay  Heaven knows what to say Even though for right now you're so far away Gonna tell you and show you Do whatever I can do to get back to you  Boy, lately my sun doesn't shine without you Never noticed what it feels like to be without you Feels like I took my last step And my last breath in my life ending Had to say just what I was feeling, boy 'cause my sun doesn't shine, Sun doesn't shine   Have you ever seen a flower that never blooms? Seen a starless night without the moon Well that's me without you So come back and turn my nights into days  Boy, lately my sun doesn't shine without you Never noticed what it feels like to be without you Feels like I took my last step And my last breath in my life ending Had to say just what I was feeling,boy 'cause my sun doesn't shine, Sun doesn't shine without you

      when i woke up this morning our house was unusually quiet. i was all alone in the house. my mom and sis went to school so my sister could change her section.(arte!) seph was early in school so all i could do was to text him (nasa library siya nagtetext!badd!hehe). grabe. im soo excited to go to school na. i still have to wait for 9days.im not excited in the idea of sleeping with 4 other unidentified human beings though (matulog sa dorm). they might be witches!hehe... but still the idea of going to college excites me.new school.new friends.new identity.new me. but this doesn't mean i'd change big time! i'll make sure i'll change for the better. i feel sad nga kasi im sure im guna feel homesick. im guna miss  my room . my super daldal na  sister . my  parents .my  hunk hun .  i just hope i can adjust agad.

      read the lyrics carefully...  Balisong  by Rivermaya   Album :     Your face lights up the sky on the highway. Someday, you'll share your world with me someday. You mesmerize me with diamond eyes; I try to fool myself to think I'll be alright. But I am losing all control - My mind, my heart, my body and my soul  Never in my life have I been more sure, So come on up to me and close the door. Nobody's made me feel this way before; You're everything I wanted and more.  To speak or not to; where to begin. The way dilemmas I'm finding myself in. For all I know you only see me as a friend.----->dnt mind this.hehe I try to tell myself wake up fool; this fairy tale's got to end.   "Never in my life have I been more sure, So come on up to me and close the door. Nobody's made me feel this way before; You're everything I wanted (more)." (Repeat 2x)  You're everything I wanted
