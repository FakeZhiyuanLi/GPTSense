      The artist is free, when presented with the IDEAL, to represent that IDEAL, in his or her own perception.  Free to be true to the 'form' of IDEAL, free to express such a change of the perceived IDEA, in whatever expression it might take.    Once the pencil has touched the paper, IDEAL is touched.  When the pencil moves, on the paper, producing the chosen form, IDEAL is reflected, through the mature consciousness of the artist..."Now Free!"

      Prerogative, a choice now made, exists as a venue, directed towards change.  The change supposes an improvement.  The existing form does not require such improvement, it does not 'need' a change.

      Artists prerogative is the choice the artist makes. The artist previsualizes the IDEAL and choices are then made as to the course to proceed. Prerogative deems a green, a dark green of shade, and this is a matter of choice.  Explicitly, prerogative is the WILL of choice, the action of "free-will choice".  It is the result of bringing a thing, as in the choice of particular color, to a manifestation, here IRL.  Similarly, a dread of the IDEAL as art, "Brings On" nothing new, having already been perfected in nature.  Only the artists Prerogative "Brings On."  It initiates that which teaches & can be relied on.  It teaches what is brought round and will be intrically woven into thought, manifesting something close to IDEAL, specifically some thing "NEW."  Prerogative, then is a verb, as an action word: "Bringing On!"

      Stieglitz sits, his head resting on his wrist, slowly he's to turn another page.  He knows what he sees, and yet... from it he may yet learn.  Possibly again.  He is relaxed, and his book rests upon solid wood as on it rests he.  (reflection on Paul Haviland "Stieglitz cyanotype" circa 1910)

      Artists prerogative does not excuse the artist from obligatory design, but instead frees the artist to create new form & design, from nature.  Thus prerogative disquises ALL in IDEAL.  Prerogative is a major physical & psychological tool for the artist as creator of IDEAL from IDEA.  Line proposes form;  Light dictates color; Art defines IDEAL; Life defines the agreements of confident friendships.

      I am the artist...I will try.  The light leaves and yet, is still.  Time remains, and life... endures, fullfilling, learning & loving!    To the artist: I do not hurry.  See what you will see.  Show me what I have not seen.  Tell me, that ideal to you.  Give me, to me, to him, her, them, but give nontheless.  To be myself to hear, is my pursuit.  With palette in hand, with the best brush... that special scene beheld.  How young to start, as I?  Which color, why that line?  The direction of light rolls across the field and yet it does not leave.  In writing, art dwells within the written word, and the light does not leave.  I long for the filled-in stain, a patch of azure and the living world that serves and consoles the light of life that never leaves... as in art.

      I sometimes pray that time not take nor deny that which I must do, must paint.  In awe I behold great Art beheld by the great and insignificant alike, created by simple men as am I.  Stroked, smudged or stained the image appears and is.  Near or far, the idea portrays image & IDEAL in timelessness.  Why this stroke, smudge or stain and not another?  Why this image?  Why this Ideal? Why this artist?  I become, AM.  I become AM.  Done, I do.  Finished, I begin.

      Reflecting on 1,000 brushstrokes, some may have been born of innocence and some by design of intent, but ALL of the dilligence of their caretakers.  Most were implicated in their persistence not to be noticed apart from the collective being, but ALL willfully interpreted.  ALL, through some hidden, replaced, or even re-born, will be seen, if not today by me...then at some time by those who were meant to!

      I just hit the wrong key and a journal entry is now lost.  I will not attempt to write my thought again, as it is given to others now as something that was created, and now exists in another reality,

      "Somehow I like the old trails      Leading to a well known end,  Where the plain marked way prevails      with no new roads to contend;   Our fathers marked out the way      Leading straight to a known goal;  From the true paths let's not stray      With fixed mind and steadfast soul;   Trails lead north, south, east & west;      We should not mistake the way;  Of all the trails I like best, -  Thats leading the heavenly way."

      I majored in oils in school, for my bachelors.  I had a split minor, watercolors and sports photo-journalism.  I sold my camera after school and soon found that oils were not what I was really best at.  I never began my masters studies, but did have a brief stint as a seminarian.  I have worked in watercolors for over twenty five years now.  It is rare that I paint a thing and am not proud of my work. I had agreat professor in college.  I do not remember his name, which at times irks me, but he taught me a good disciplene in working with the colors.    And during those twenty five years, I picked up maybe three new things that I set my palette to, as a rule.  I remember just four years ago, when I was again trying a portrait, and there before me was a resemelence!  I had worked the portrait for thirty five years and had never...NEVER had a resembelence.  And since then I have painted over a hundred!  Theres a good chance I will paint again tomorrow.  I know I will do a bit of gardening, and laundry, but I will keep in mind I painted today, and instantly someone walked away with my watercolor.  I gave my work away, well not really gave it away... I donated it to a society I am involved with.  But the thing is, someone wanted it, liked it, and thanked me for it.  Theres a connection between the fingers, and the eyes, and the brain... and the paper as well!  I feel that connection as never before.  All it took was twenty five years.

      I painted today!  And I experienced the act of painting like I always do, and often forget.  I started this painting and about a quarter of the way through I got totally frustrated with it, started on another sheet of paper, and then realized that I had better finish the first one, as I did not have the materials to finish the second one, as I was outside and away from home.  So back to the frustration.  Halfway through I just let go!  I started to trust my intuition and soon, what I had thought was a disaster became a work I was fast becoming proud of.  I continued to trust in my abandon and was creating quite a stir within my psyche.  I was losing myself completely and had to sit on my hands three times.  I finally was able to get up and walk away from my work, and surley I am always glad when that happens, as I know all too well, what mud looks like.  I walked over and got some clean water and when I got back I saw two areas to concentrate on, and once started, I was finally finished.  I produced a work that I was quite proud of.  And remembering that just minutes before I had abandoned this work, I remembered how frustration is always a cornerstone for me, in painting watercolors.

      "Non-Formative Random Ascending Patterning Theory (as causation for structuring of layering of energy roadways)." 1.  Structural layering.  Given two energy carriewrs meshed together to provide optimum conductive strength, given each carrier is independent of each other in current.  Given one carrier is capable of carrying ground, and dimenishing it at some point, would give example that one carrier is stronger in ratio to other carrier.

      I begin with the understanding that ultimately sin, is knowledge ignored.  For many years I was intoxicated by the appearance of knowledge beyond my mortal comprehension, ever-filling my own mind.  And yet, I did not act, as the effects of the mind-altering experiences that were entirely synthesized were like that unto the act of stepping back from the thin veil that separated me from the Divine Truth.  This is so true for the artist, the creative mind.  Many artists have attempted, while  self-medicated, to bring forth the information and enlightening aspects of the Divine Truth, and many have sounded like a noisy gong, confused and even leading others toward a chaotic experience.  Such is the responsibility of the artist, to allow the flow of the Divine Creative spark without hindering it.  This is a Divine truth I ignored for years and years.  My passion for the creative gifts have ever-increased since my decision to cast out the intoxicating spirits from my own mind.  It was not possible to fully utilize this creative flow, without the taking on of responsibilities, including the avoidance of hedonistic abandon.  In a way, Hermetic teachings illustrate for us the very simple attitude that as mere humans, we all have the potential to render useless the veil.  This veil separates us from the realization of what we might actually be capable of, in this lifetime!  Those who do not choose the afore-mentioned choice, will never come to this realization.  And yet the veil has importance, for without it we would not understand that what we know as the Truth is subject to eternal, continual revision.  I will try and be blunt here, as simplicity is my only signpost for the reader.  Many have grasped a seemingly illusive bit of eternal Truth, and written lengthy texts about it, supposedly leading the rest of us on to enlightenment, actually only confusing the truth into a never-ending container of pure dung.  Might even I presume to know myself these truths?  I answer no, in that like others before me, I have only grasped the outer edges of Truth eternal and hang there, my fingers clutching the very edge of the top of the deepest ravine.  When I release my stranglehold of the belief that this world in which I have manifested is in its own entirety, I begin to know that it is nothing more than having a dream while having a dream.  I say that as our existence in the 'known universe' appears intentionally finite.  And yet, when I let go of my hold to the edge of that which is known to us as the three dimensions of life, I am actually opening my mind to the potential that what I 'know' as Truth, might actually be only a small fraction of the Truth.  I do not fall upon my release, for at that moment, gravity, as well as other rules of this third dimension disappears!  As we traverse time and space, we are continuing to accelerate our comprehension of the existence of half-truths, and in doing such we are continuing to expand our conscious contact with our higher natures.  I say this in closing, that the next eight years will hold such a change in the resonance of our heartbeats, that our world today, will be as unrecognizable to us as the effects and trappings of our predecessors at the turn of the twentieth century.

      We have seen how thought can be visual.  The story 'can be' visual, in as much as the visual experience belongs to the story teller, and his or hers connection to the story and the the one listening to the story's response, in as much as that persons relative memory base, in which to interpret that story.  How then, can what is called today by many, 'previsualization' be a visual art?  It cannot.  In its most basic form, previsualization is nothing more than verbal story telling.    Within the mind of the story teller, the scene, the story & the characters all are visualized by the story teller, in order to best relate what can best be described as 'previsualization.'  Previsualization occurs within the mind of the story teller.  The story can exist as words on a paper, or a computer screen, but herein this manifestation of the story, has taken on form, and exists in the dimension of a thing.    Today's film production has come to coin the word 'previsualization' as the act of 3D rendering of a scene, using the high speed, high memory & graphic acceleration of a modern computer.  This reportedly saves enormous pre=production costs and foresees some difficulties, which may arise.  While the 3D rendering on the computer screen is in fact only 2 dimensional, the result is that it is visual.  And being visual, it is not pre-visual.  If a thing is in its nature visual, it cannot ever be previsual.  Thus, the story teller, through the spoken word is the ultimate previsualization artist, encouraging those who hear the story, to imagine, to associate memories and thoughts & thereby to visualize for themselves.

      We are all able to 'see' a story in our minds eye.  When we listen to a person telling a story, we can use our minds eye, to participate with the story teller.  We use our sense of hearing to listen to the story teller, and if the story teller is very good at telling a tale, we might even interpret the tale via past memories of feelings, smells & other stories.  Some would call our act of participation imagination.  When we use our imagination, within the thought structure within our human brain, our thoughts enlist us to fully participate, creating new thought as a direct result of hearing & participating with the story.  When we use our minds eye, our imagination, we utilize what some have called 'creative visualization.'  This author would call this merely vision.  Vision reminds us of a thought which is uncommon.  Thought which is new and unique.  This singular type of originality requires visualization.  In all 5 of our senses, there are responses to stimuli.  We hear, but hearing is after all response to auditory sound.  Taste is a response to the receptors on the tongue of a person who is consuming a food or beverage.  To touch is to experience a tactile surface with the human body's largest organ, the skin.  We smell a thing.  Does the thing smell if we do not perceive it with our olfactory sense?  Of course!  Does the thing create a sound, just because we are not present to hear it?  Of course!  Visualization occurs as a part of the visual experience.  A thing is, and we perceive it, we see it.

      It started out to be another day of hacking up dried blood from my lungs.  I went to the Grateful Heads N.A. speaker meeting at Terra Nova Clubhouse at 10:00 in the morning.  My lungs are damaged beyond repair, (I believe) from smoking all that crack through a stem.  Like I said, just another day, until I went down to my Temple, for the monthly psychic faire.  Last year, probably around October I was asked to participate in the monthly fairs as a psychic, and I agreed.  I did twelve fifteen minute readings in a row, and was so exhausted.  Ond of the first clients came up to me after the faire was over and asked if I wanted some art supplies she had just laying around the house, (for free) and I said yes.  "Come on outside to my car," she said.  There in her car she handed me a set (maybe 40) of pastel chalks and several pads of drawing paper!  She said she had lots & lots more at home.  This woman gave me about a hundred dollars US of art supplies and said she would give me more.  I was very thankful for her gift, and told her so, but I asked why she was not going to use these herself.  She answered by telling me she had fancied herself an artist for many years, but could never get "the hang of it."  She had over the yaers bought a "lot of supplies" and never really used them, preferring to sit and watch TV instead.  In my mind I knew exactly what she was talikng about, having had set my art aside, (even though I did continue to purchase supplies) while I was busy smoking crack.  note~ I am working on a post about my crack habit, but I am still hesitent to post it.  note~ I am 4 and 1/2 years clean from crack!

      Those thoughts that really mean something, not when you think them, but later... later when you realize exactly what was really going on.  those thoughts are rare for me.  And doing something as a result of thinking them are even rarer.   I have got to  say... that I sometimes don't really know what most other people are thinking, but I bet they are thinking at lightspeed.   I do things during the day, and my days are fairly sublime.  my older brother however, does so many many things during the day and I can't fathom the speed at which he is thinking. I admire him.

      I was responding to a letter from a friend the other day.  he was relating to me how he is re-defining the musical scale.  This man is one of my three best friends, in this incarnation.  I've known him for about thirty five years.  Anyways, back to the chimes.  I bought some chimes at a metaphysical shp a couple years back.  I brushed against them, and the sound of them just, well... I "felt" the sound, inside me.  I told my friend about it, because he is a musician as well as the best artist I know.  It is because of him, that I feel a need to seek the Ideal.  I have placed my chimes on a know that is a pull to a not-much-opened cabinent.  They make their sounds only when I need to open the cabinent and when the cats play with them.  That sound they make, touches my inner being.  I asked my friend if he had ever felt this way when he played music that he created.  The answer in a later post, I trust.  I wondered if other people have felt this connection to sound.  I have listened to many, many albums and songs and some have touched me in a way that I only knew as 'enjoyable."  I have these chimes, as I mentioned before and they touch me, maybe that's all I have to know, at this time, but I want it to be more.

      I have been feeling quite asunder these last thirty days.&nbsp; My health is failing, and I have chosen this format to quelsh my longing to share things I have to share.&nbsp; I was told once, at a young christians conference that to read one chapter of the book of Proverbs each day for thirty days.&nbsp; I've never done it.&nbsp; I'm now practicing a spiritual path, and probably has a lot more to do with Pythagoras than Jesus.&nbsp; My Higher Power...is my Higher Power, that's it.&nbsp; But when I was feeling so bad last night, I did say to 'God' that I needed a few more days.&nbsp; I woke up this morning, and my heart wasn't pounding, it wasn't hurting.&nbsp; I have a few more days I guess.  I went to study the acoustical effects of the Continental Cathedral naive versus the English cathedral naive, in 1974.&nbsp; And my art bloomed in Paris, in the late Spring, in May.&nbsp; I went to the Paris school of art, and heard a professor say that Picasso once said that for an aspiring artist were to become very good, he or she would sketch everyday... for thirty days.&nbsp; I've never done it.&nbsp; I think I tried a few dozen times, but those mind and mood altering substances always got in the way, or just plain didn't care about being a better artist than what I was born with.  I had a watercolor professor in College that said something about doing a watercolor a day for thirty days, and I did do that once.  In Narcotics Anonymous I learned that if I really had wanted to get clean, once and for all, that I had to come to a meeting everyday... for ninty days.&nbsp; And I have done that... a few times even.&nbsp; I really wanted that for my life, more than religion... more than talent... even more than Art.
