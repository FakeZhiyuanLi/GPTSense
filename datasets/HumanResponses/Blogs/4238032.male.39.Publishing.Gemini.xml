       Interesting day today, although v tiring. I was moderating (or facilitating if you will) a software estimating session. We are potentially going to be doing a very large (for us) software development. It will probably turn out to be about £1m by the time everything's done. However, we are just trying to sell it to the board at the moment (they have the purse strings) so we have to get a rough idea of how much its going to cost so that we can even see if its worth carrying on. So my boss says we're going to use this technique called "Wideband Delphi" (Look it up yourself) that is a sort of collaborative and iterative way of coming up with a range of estimates. At the last minute he pulled out and asked me to facilitate (or moderate). It was very interesting although really tiring. I was exhausted by the end of it - really brain-dead. The things I noticed were: 1: Most of the developers were really uncomfortable with working with the amount of uncertaintly that we had and wanted to do a lot more work before committing to any numbers. The thing they didn't seem to grasp was that with more work they might come up with a more precise number but that number would not necessarily be any more accurate. 2: Some of the developers worked by looking for abstractions to identify common components that they could develop whereas others (our Indian " partners" from Wipro) worked on the basis of implementing the functionality they saw in front of them without any regard for the amount of duplication that this would involve. I think the reasons for this are partly cultural and partly commercial. I'll probably expand on this in a later blog.  If anyone out there has experience of the Wideband Delphi process or any other estimation techniques I would be very interested to read of your experiences.

       Just a qick one today as I'm trying to learn the lines of the latest play I'm in: "Ouija Board" by  urlLink Graham Rhodes . We're putting it on at the  urlLink Valley Theatre  in Scarborough. First performance is 2nd September. We've had good reviews from the  urlLink Yorkshire Post  and  urlLink Scarborough Evening News  and it only costs £2 so what have you got to lose (unless you're living in Melbourne)?  BTW learning lines is a really good use for the iPod. What I do is I record the whole thing onto my pc then I cut out all of my part. Rip it to MP3 and transfer to iPod using iTunes and Bingo!

       Now then, the brakes...  The bike came with  urlLink Magura Julies  on which were ok but never fantastic. See my review of them here:  urlLink Magura 2002 Julie Reviews  Then after 2 and a half years of not too heavy use (I am an XC rider, not a downhiller, although I do weigh 14 stones (internet challenge for all you non-UK readers!)) they failed completely, pulling right back to the bar. Took them back to my friendly local bike shop - Richardson's in Scarborough (sorry no website as yet) and Debbie suggested we send them back to Magura as they are supposed to have a 5 year leak-proof warrenty. Magura came back saying that they wouldn't fix them as I had been using sintered pads and you are only supposed to use organic compound pads (which last about 5 minutes in UK conditions - lots of wet, sandy mud). I checked their manuals and although it did say that you were only supposed to use Magura spares, there was nothing about not using sintered pads. Like most people I assumed that the "Only use Magura" thing was just designed to help them sell more stuff. Anyway, Debbie got back to me, saying she had got nowhere with the Magura service department and I basically needed new brakes but gave me their phone number so that I could give it a try. I phoned them and got a real "like it or lump it" attitude from the guy I talked to. He reckoned that the brakes had overheated and the master-cylinder seal had gone. I ( and everyone I've talked to ) think thats a load of rubbish cos the master cylinder is on the lever and for the brake fluid to get hot enough to get to the master cylinder it would surely have melted the cheap plastic hose they use. And another thing, why would the back brake go before the front, eh? Anyway, after five minutes of getting nowhere, I said "There's no point in continuing this conversation, I'll wish you the best of luck cos with your attitude, I think you're going to need it!", which I think was pretty good going for the spur of the moment. So now I've got some spangly new  urlLink Hope Mini Mono  brakes. These are great for the following reasons: They're British! Better than that, they're Northern (tho from Lancashire (small boo!))! The feel and modulation is fantastic - you can use 1 finger braking going downhill. They look the business, black anodised aluminium with gold piston inserts, very bling! They don't rub  at all  and, so far the pads seem to be lasting longer than the Maguras. Anyway, I've only had them for about 2 weeks so I'll update you as and when.  So the lesson is, don't buy Magura, ever. (apparently their motorbike stuff is good tho)

       My current recreational obsession is mountain biking. I compete in a mountain bike orienteering league which is here:  urlLink EBOR - Bike-O . With 7 events down I am defying the advancing years to hold onto 9th place (I am 39, and the senior league is 18-40). I reckon I need two good results out of the last 4 events to hold onto a top-ten finish (my target for the year). As a typical man I shall start by describing my mountain bike!  My mountain bike started off 2 and a half years ago as a stock  urlLink Specialized Rockhopper Disk . Over time I have replaced everything except the frame, stem and handle-bars. I have tried to wait til things wore out before replacing them. This is the state of it the bike now:   Forks:  Were originally:  urlLink Manitou 6 comp . Reason for replacing: I thought the seals were going (although it turned out to be the headset) although I had never really been happy with the performance. The lack of rebound damping meant that fast downhill rides were very exciting (read uncontrolled and scary!) and during a competition I was bucked off the bike completely in a spectacular manner. With a huge audience! Replaced with:  urlLink Pace RC36 Pro-Class II  Verdict: Fantastic forks! British! Better than that, made in  urlLink North Yorkshire  (my adopted home county). What happened was, after research I had decided that I wanted a set of Pace forks but was going to buy them when I had saved up enough money. When I heard that Pace were bringing out the hollowform forks I decided to bring forward my purchase. This turned out to be a good decision as I got a lockout equipped fork for the same price as a non-lockout. Having used a lockout I would never buy a fork without now. It makes a huge difference on the road and up-hill on fire roads if you get out of the saddle. In use the fork is very smooth and never seems to get out of control. Its particular strength is fast bumpy tracks (it is a race fork after all). I have left it on the 80mm setting. I may change it to 100mm so I will let you know how I get on. I had it serviced after 1 year and one of the springs had broken so I only waited 6 months for the next service. At the next service another spring had broken so I am going to stay with 6 month services at the moment. A broken spring doesn't seem to make to much difference to the performance although the forks were noticably smoother after the service.  Well as it's beautifully sunny outside, I will finish now as I need to be out on the bike. More details later. Look out for a rant on Magura brakes!
