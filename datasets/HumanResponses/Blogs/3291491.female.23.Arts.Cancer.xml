      so i have come to a conclusion about an issue that has, up to now, made me uncomfortable throughout different stages of my life.  but first, a prelude.  the majority of my family lives "over the pond." therefore, being able to actually *see* them in person is an opportunity that one does not take lightly. usually, when we do get the rare opportunity to visit with our family in europe, it is circled round a holiday, family reunion, or some landmark birthday that one of my relatives has reached. Inevitably, out come the cameras to document such an occasion that will happen only once every five years. When I was very young I have nightmarish memories of my grandmother stalking me with her camera so as to catch every single moment of my growth, clumsiness and mistakes as i struggled through childhood without her nearby. I *hated* it. To the point where I would go out of my way to hide from her, and a result, she would end up crying to my father that I was going to be anti-social when I grew up or that I did not love her. Both of which are clearly not true. [Okay, so maybe I can be a little anti-social. But just a little.] Anyway, as I grew older, and out of my "awkward" stages (which I am convinced I am still in) I become somewhat more amiable towards the camera, especially as I became intimately familiar with it as a form of art, expression, communication. However, I have still been somewhat against those obnoxious "I dont care what you are doing" ambushed family-type photos. Until recently.  2 years ago my mother's father passed away. he lived in Ireland for most of his life, save for about 4 years when he lived in Essex, giving me the irreplaceable opportunity to have him in my life for at least a short period of time. as the years went by, i was the only member of the family that he kept in touch with, send postcards and gifts to, and called on my birthday. it was because of this that i was asked to speak at his funeral, and also that i was the recipient of 4 large boxes of photographs that arrived without return address last summer. they were of him, his wives, his daughters ... me. they ranged from old, sepia mounted images of him in his youth, winning the european table tennis championship to scratched polaroids of family vacations and modern snapshots of his grandchildren. i started the harrowing process of sorting through them, archiving them, and intending to scan them for everyone in the family. it has been a year and i am still not done with it all.   now, my father's father is ill. and visiting him last week in the hospital made me realize several things that one only really understands with age. the first being that he is not going to be with me forever, which of course is something i have known all along, but refused to believe until it stares me in the face. it occurred to me, that even though i have always respected and admired the large black and white photographs we have in our home of my grandfather (farfar) when he was young, that i have never really considered them. considered their history. their meaning. and most importantly, their reflection of my own life. so, i decided, while gripping my grandfathers cold hand and trying to hold back tears in front of my younger sister, that i wanted more of those photographs. of then. and of now.   so, as my professors always told me to do, i have decided that i want to "document everything." i want to take photographs of every moment that i am with my family, or without them. with my friends. at a special event. or simply hanging out by myself capturing the "going-ons" around me. i want to be able to share them with my grandfather, or have them for myself when the people i love and care about the most are no longer with me. i think a lot of people underestimate the value of a photograph. the emotion that can be expressed through freezing a simple image or action at a point in time. the memories, or senses, that can come flooding back just by holding a polaroid in your hand, or developing a black and white in a dark room. i have been going through countless CDs i have of images that i have scanned, or digitally taken, most from school, some of family, or life in general. i am creating online albums so that i can share them. or just refer to them whenever i want to. i feel better that way, knowing that i always have the pictures at my fingertips, even if i dont have the people within them.  i think the biggest part of my realization is this: that instead of always being *behind* the camera (which, as an art student, i could get away with as an excuse) i want to make sure that i am in some, most, of these photos, because i think i will regret it if i am not. so...  out comes the 35mm, digital nikon, and antique canon that was given to me by my grandfather and is older than my own father. and... i definitely want a polaroid camera.  and just "document everything."

      observations within an ordinary office // i have decided that the two counterfeit million dollar bills by boss so generously referred to as "my raise" will indeed be the only money i will ever see from this company, and are worth *more* clumsily taped to my g5 than my paycheck is every other week // why is it that someone who is successful within the digitial photo industry is unable to email a 450K image? // the m&ms that nancy left in the jar on the "pit" half wall lasted a mere 5 minutes. and jim isnt even here today // "its jaaaaaayyyy whitehead!" // the once 45-second *outside breaks* have turned into 15 minute roundtable sessions swarming with office gossip, mullets, ugly cars and basic procrastination methods // i have a small jewelry box sitting on my desk that is in the shape of a little frog with a crown on his head. i thought i had already found my prince charming. and i didnt even have to kiss a frog to do so // monday, august 2 is a civic holiday in canada according to my calendar, i think i should take the day off // i am trapped in one of those tunnels where i have so many thing to do for work, that it is a full time job just organizing them in my head or on paper, let alone actually completing them // i am off to the movies this evening before spiderman webs his way out of the theaters // i could really go for a frozen blue caracao margarita right now // the cleaning crew just came last night and emptied everyone's trash, and yet, it is not even 4.00p and bryan has already managed to fill mine back up // [c] has disowned me and claims i am spamming him // i do not understand this place sometimes and why things are down how they are // sigh // back to work.

      "i know what you mean. i suppose you have to think of it that you will always be something she *knows* not someone she *knew* -- as hard as that may be. it is a strange cycle to meet someone, fall in love, learn how to live with and around them and then have faith in whatever course that takes. I suppose, as idealistic as it sounds, that you have to believe something better will come along, and while you will never discount or forget what you had with her, and what she contributed to your life, you are a better person in some way because of her -- and because of that you will never lose her. i have only recently reached the point in my life where i have wanted to make a step to move in with someone else, in that ultra-serious manner that is suggested by doing such a thing in this society. my experiences have been so green, and ultimately i am still learning, as everyone is, what one wants, expects, or loves in someone else. i think ultimately it is someone that brings out the best in you -- and allows you to be who you are without changing you or themselves for it -- who has dreams that are as big as yours, and can be silly or serious in the same 5 minutes within the day."

      i feel as though the past few days have escaped from me. so much has happened, so many thoughts have been thrashing through my brain and i just havn't had time to organize them all in front of me. it is raining today, Bryan and Scottie are listening the radio, as usual, and C and I have been having *deep* conversations via email that have left my heart feeling so bad for him that i know he needs a hug. either way, i suppose the kosher way to sort through everything would be here... so that i don't impose my thoughts on anyone except those who choose to read them.  for starters, my grandfather has fallen ill and landed himself in and out of hospitals up and down the CT shoreline. in a recipie combining severe diabetes, congestive heart failure and just the unavoidable fact of getting old, he managed to fall down several times, raise his blood sugar levels close to that of immediate death and scare that life out of all of his family -- myself included. i never really realize how poorly i deal with losing people in my life until it comes to the moment of truth... when my hard exterior starts to melt down and my vulnerable heart starts to show through. [as my boss always says, i am true to my zodiac in so many ways.] anyway, after trying to hold myself together during a visit with him over the weekend, i am pleased that he is finally home, and while he needs to be in a *time-out* so this doesn't happen again, i am ultimately blessed that he is still in my life.  i think i am developing a hernia from work. i love my job. i love the people i work with (for the most part). and i really love what i do. but i have never dealt well with politics of any kind, even though i know that as long as i live on this planet i will never be able to escape them. i either must resign myself back to 40 hours a week, relinquish control of my creative department and appear rather *lazy* -- or i have to get the ballz to go speak to my boss about a raise. the irony of it is that i have tried, on *many* occasions to talk to him, and i always end up getting the "brush off" -- well, after 3 rather harrowing days in the office, i am buckling down and waiting for the most oportune time to bring it all up again.  trisha was just visiting for several days. i know she hates connecticut, and is so much happier a world away in south carolina, but i really wish that she was here often. and not planning a wedding. especially to michael. but, alas, i will be supportive. and wonderful. and the best maid of honor that i can possibly manage at this point in time.  well, my writing time, which is really supposed to be working time, is being interrupted by several forces, so i will write more later when i am less involved in the social chaos that i like to call the "office."

      i am continually amazed by the [epiphany-like] moments that occur in my life, and ultimately form a realization for myself that i would have otherwise been unaware of. one of those life-defining "i dont need this anymore" moments - sort of like when you realize that you no longer have the desire to go to college bars and get sloshed, but you would rather stay home and watch t.v. - one of those "wait a second, i think im an adult" moments. i had another one of those last night.  i ran into "the ex."   someone i loved for many years, and will still continue to *love* although only for the experience he gave me, and not the feelings in return. we have reached the point of civility, maybe even friendship (in the future) but i still get restless when i am around him. i remember what it was like to be with him -- in the beginning, at school, at the end. and i know for sure now, that i don't want any of that back again. of course, there are still parts of him that tug on me, mainly his family, but we are so different, polar opposites in our aspirations, desires, thoughts, that it is crystal clear to me now why we didnt work out... yet it still took a 4yr journey to figure it out *then* – it has been months since i have seen him, despite the fact we live mere minutes from one another, but every time i see him the first bit of imagery that comes to mind is of [metallic orange paint]. don't ask.   anyway, as much as i thought i was in love with him at one time, last night he helped me realize just how much i am in love now, which is more than i realized was ever possible. so, thanks.   [c] just came into work late, got in a car accident this morning. thankfully, he and his truck are fine, but when you drive a rhinosaurus of course you would be fine. its the other guy im more worried about. old 97s tonight at toads place.  *sigh*  it is "one of those days" today.

      i am so conflicted right now. normally i feel organized, put together, in one piece and in control of myself and what i "want." but right now i have absolutely no clue. i find myself questioning my job, where i live, what i want to do in the future. there is one aspect of my life that i am absolutely 100% sure about, and oftentimes that relieves the stress of worrying about everything else, but when that one aspect takes a temporary leave of my day to day physical doings, i find myself back again not knowing what to do, which way to go, or what might be best for me in general.

      so i have decided to start a new blog.   ive been reading through my livejournal that i started when i was in college sometime, and i have no more desire to attach my current thoughts on life with my immature dribble that crowded the virtual pages of my somewhat depressing exisitance at uconn // and while i will not be getting rid of my livejournal entirely, i just feel like i need to start somewhere else // do something different // and immerse myself in a new typographic environment.  "White people scare the crap out of me. … I have never been attacked by a black person, never been evicted by a black person, never had my security deposit ripped off by a black landlord, never had a black landlord … never been pulled over by a black cop, never been sold a lemon by a black car salesman, never seen a black car salesman, never had a black person deny me a bank loan, never had a black person bury my movie, and I've never heard a black person say, 'We're going to eliminate ten thousand jobs here - have a nice day!'"

      trisha is getting married in april. as far away as that may seem, it is significantly closer than it was two years ago when she got engaged, or six months ago when i visited her in south carolina, or just days ago when we tried on dresses and shopped for flowers. this will be the second wedding that i have been the "honorable maid" for, and the first one barely lasted a year, so i really hope that i am not the bad luck charm. as i get older, each year, more and more of my friends are getting married. or talking about it. or thinking about it. and that means more and more weddings to participate in, go to, shop for ... and more and more pressure about "my own" -- when, where, buffet or filet mignon? [well, we all know the answer that *that*]  to my family, getting married means security and stability. to me, it means being able to wrap the love of my life around my finger and my heart... to give as much to someone that i receive from them -- and most importantly, to know that i will always have my best friend at my side.  i was never the little girl who played with barbie dolls, had an easybake oven or clipped white bed sheets to my pony tail pretending that i was the most beautiful bride in the world. now that i am older, and my femininity has a tendency to show through every now and then, the dream of being "the most beautiful bride" in the world, seems closer to reality.  i think a lot of people get caught up in the *hype* of getting married. the money, the flowers, the dresses, the favors, the cake, the guest lists, the open bar...  how much everything costs rather than what everything means. cookie cutter weddings get lost in the pages of magazines, dusty photoalbums and bridesmaid dresses that will never be worn again. i don't want any of that. i want a wedding that doesn't get lost anywhere, but rather stays in the memories and hearts of the people who were there, the people who were part of it, and most importantly me and the man that i marry.   i want to get married outdoors. in the summertime. on the water, or beach, somewhere. i want to be able to feel the warmth of the sun, and smell the breeze of the saltwater, both feelings that i grew up with, and are comforting to me. i always pictured myself, clutched to my father's folded arm, wrapped in perfectly white silk that wound up my shoulders, followed the contour of my silouhette and kissed the ground with ribboned edges. i want to take the breath away of the man that i am walking towards, just as he does everytime that i kiss him. i want to stare into his eyes as we say our own vows, and as those around us become fuzzy, because really we are the only ones there. i want to weave my fingers into his when we kiss for the first time in front of all of our family and friends. i want orchids and lillies of deep fushia, orange and yellow that wrap around my hands, and crawl over tables and chairs, and sweet whipped frosting of the softest cake in creation. i want a huge tent, covered with white sheer fabric that allows you to see the stars as the night wears on. i want paper lanterns littering the rafters, and small white lights lining the ground, the dance floor and the edges of the tent -- not to compete with a perfectly star-laden sky, but rather to make the transition seamless. i want to dance until morning, visit with family and friends that i have not seen in years, and walk away with feelings, memories and photographs to last a lifetime.  i think what most people forget, is that the wedding is just the beginning of a lifetime relationship, not the main event itself. and to me, it is the years following the wedding that i am most looking forward to.
