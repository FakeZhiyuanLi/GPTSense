      Why do alot of women cross their arms and grab the bottom to take off their top...I suppose it does looks sexy, but wouldn't the whole process be alot faster and easier if you just grab up by the collar?

      I like them, especially ones that are part of doors, such as knobs.

      I am not your typical run of the mill 23 year old. I don't enjoy partaking in things that most 23 year olds do. Therefore, I would guess I am viewed as a loner. It seems that everyone my age always wants to be doing something. They aren't content sitting for more than a minute. I have people that get pissed off at me when I don't want to go out, especially girlfriends I have had. Why? Why should I go out to the bars like everyone else? It's overrated. What's the point of going into a place where it's too loud, people are way to obnoxious, it's impossible to have conversation, and I get overcharged for drinks? If i want to drink I do it at home. 1, it's cheaper, 2, If I have too much to drink, I am at home already and don't have to risk making a scene in public, or having to drive home drunk. 3. It's quiet. Why should I go out and engage in that. I stay home. My life consits of a pretty basic routine. I wake up, spend some time online, eat something, go to work, come home, then I usually sit in my room and play my guitar. Turn the lights off, light some inscence and play. It's because of this that I am viewd a loner, and usually don't establish many relationships. Women find me odd, and frankly don't understand my lifestyle, or the things I am interested in. I have come to the conclusion that I don't care. All these women have done is rip me apart time and time again. I thought back the other day about all of the girlfriends I have had, and realized that none of them were even remotely interested in anything about me whatsoever. Maybe it's because I am too simple. I enjoy a quiet calm atmosphere, and no drama. I am content with just sitting at home and playing my guitar. I take alot of pride in my skills as a musican and songwriter, and it is my love. No one seems to really understand that about me. Frankly I don't know what is so hard to get. But people can question why that this is enough for me, and go on 'doing stuff', but at the end of the day what can they say they've accomplished? At least I can say I've created something with my music. Frankly I just don't understand everyone's fascination in 'doing stuff'? It's overated. Take Hitler for example. He did alot, but don't we all wish he would have just stayed home, gotten stoned, and do nothing?

      I think it is necessary to explain the whole philosophy of nothing in detail. The basic idea, is that everything is nothing, and nothing is everything...make sense? It's like this. Right now you are reading words on a computer screen. What is a computer screen? What are words for that matter? The answer is nothing. What makes a cup a cup? Why isn't a tree really a chair? The answer to this question is that we as humans do not have the brain cpacity to understand difference. Therefore we must give everything a name or label to seperate them for us to know the difference, and ultimately understand. The simple fact of the matter is, that every thing in it's purest form is nothing. It's namelss, shapeless, it has no boudaries untill we declared them. There are very few that understand this concept, except alot of the genious thinkers we have had. I understand this concept, and when I explain it, people think I am a nutjob. But that's ok, I don't fault them for their lack of understanding. I accept it. I accept the fact that humans in general are a very lame species. People can call me crazy, but like my predecessors, who were tohught of as crazy while thye were living, I might be in the history books 100 years from now as one of the great genious minds and thinkers in history.

      What is reality. I guess some people would think that is as plain as the shirt you are wearing. But how do we know what is real and what is not? How are we to know that everything we know to be true isn't some fake universe that is a speck in a continuous line of alter realities. What's past reality? I want to be there... where everything is in it's purest state, what it is, was, and always will be, Nothing
