  WARNING: THIS PART OF MY DIARY MIGHT OFFEND...BUT DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN ALL YOU CRAZIES OUT HERE!!
 
July 6, 2004.....okay, if you want to get technical about it, it would really be the 7th, but who the hell cares! I'm still awake even though it is now pushing 1:30AM....ya, I'm a rebel alright....lol! So what to say...hmmm? Well there is always a lot to say cause I'm a yapper, that's why I'm loved so much..ha,ha,ha! It doesn't have to make sense or be important or be anything as long as I can yack my little head off....right? Well let's see, I've titled this life sucks so I should probably work with that one eh? Ya, eh? Can you tell I'm from Canada, eh? Eh? Well can you, eh? Lol....So anywho, I am frustrated with my life. It sucks! I have no money, have no life, never get to do anything and have to yell at my son constantly, not to mention my INSANE husband, who shall remain nameless. Wouldn't want anyone to know who I've been shackled to for the rest of my miserable life now would I? Okay, yes I really do love my husband but he is insane. He has to take insane pills to keep him sane which would be great if they actually were doing the job they are supposed to. It's like I am living with my 8 year old son twice. What a pity eh? Oh hell, there I go with the eh thing? Has it lost it's touch I wonder...? Lol.

Well let's go on to the rest of my misery shall we? I am not working, neither is my husband, we have no money and we live in a hell hole of an apt. I swear this place is shit. The only way my life could get worse would be if I had to live on the street.....not that I am complaining or anything...lol! Oh and did I mention that it is hot as fucking hell in this damnable city? The humidity sucks, the sun sucks, the fact that there is no air circulating in this shit hole is another downfall of course. Do we have fans....oh sure we have a couple fans, but do they give us a good blow? I would have to say NOT! That didn't come out like it was supposed to did it? Oh well, what the hell. Oh ya, and lets not forget the INSANE FUCKERS we have to give our rent to...could they be any more DUMB? I think yes, oh hell yes, that they could. They complain about our child and everyone else's child, when they are playing outside of all the stupid things, then they come crying to us saying that our children are not allowed to do diddly squat, albeit in the apt. or out of the apt. Oh but of course this is a children's community, according to the fucked up landlord, who by the way does nothing, I repeat, NOTHING at all in anyone's apt., but believe me, something needs to be done. Most apts. have like a billion ants crawling all over their place, in their food, on their body, in their cupboards, on furniture....oh ya, it's great! What would we do without all the crawly things, such as earwigs, ants, spiders, did I forget anything? And then of course there is the parking lot. It literally floods when we get rain, that is how holey the whole damned thing is, oh but then again, so do our windows in the apt., they leak all the damned time when it rains, at least the kitchen window does. And the balconies are falling apart, in need of repair, but instead they thought to tear them right off the fucking walls of the buildings. Then there is the balcony doors. Do they lock you say? Hell no, they don't even have the fucking windows put in properly. They're backwards would you believe? Yes, that's right, backwards of all the stupidest things. The idiot landlords don't even know how to put a damned window in correctly. Can you imagine the rest of the place? Yep, we live in luxury....what do we do.....lol. Not that I am complaining or anything....well you know what? I am sick of talking about where I live cause I think we can all say, it's been covered!

You know, my life has been full of a hell of a lot of downs, but as of yet, not too many ups, in my opinion. I used to write poetry eons ago, which would probably sound really stupid now, but I just might put a few on here so people can read them, but if you give an opinion on them, I might have to come through the computer screen to beat the bloody hell out of each and everyone of you....lol! Just kidding, I couldn't fit through my screen...ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.....I've also made up some of my own quotes so I just might use those to start off my babbling, who knows? They might give someone clarity, or not...lol!
Actually I am a pretty down to earth type of gal...I mean sure, I do enjoy playing in the dirt, enjoy the freedom of speech, you know, the same ole, same ole, but that doesn't mean a damned thing to any of you does it? I mean here I am, spilling my guts out, but does anyone care? Of course not, they are too interested in their own lame excuses of their life....ha, ha, ha, ha....got you again! Psyche! That's all I can say....hee, hee, hee, hee......
You know, I'm beginning to think outside of the box....whatever the hell that means. I've just heard that expression before so I thought I would share....isn't that sweet of me? Ya, ya, ya....I know....99% of the world is stupid which puts me right on in their with all of them, right? Aha.....whatever, screw you.....kidding again! It's kind of funny, I don't usually swear "much" in my day to day routine, but ironically it feels really good! Lol...

Holy shit, could I babble much more....oh sure I could! Just a minute, I'm getting my next wave of words from my pea-sized brain.....they're trying to reach my head....with many struggles...uh oh, it's about to......EXPLODE!!! Overdrive alert! Overdrive alert!! Oh damn! The words got jammed.....they are now on their own little planet....lol!

Oh hey....my friends are coming down from Alberta, in Canada, for those of you who DO NOT KNOW where it is....how dare you....She and her family moved out to Alberta a whole year ago now, so they are coming back to London, in the province of Ontario which, for that 99% of you do not understand, is in CANADA....Hello!! Can we say DUUUHHHHH!! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.....Oh and guess what else I am going to post? My father-in-law's jokes. No, they are not ACTUALLY his you dults....they are just jokes he finds, but I have to tell you, they are so fucking hilarious! They are great, believe me! However, BE WARNED: some may contain adult situations, language, violence, death, vulgarity, insanity, who knows! Sooooo.....BE WARNED!!!! No children should even attempt to read them or I will take their childhood...lol! I WILL SEE YOU, TRUST ME!! Please do keep in mind again however, that I am still getting used to this blogger thing, so It might take some practice to do it, but do not despair.....I will find a way......I will, if it is the last thing I do, you can be sure I WILL FIND A WAY!!!!

I will be damned surprise if someone actually reads all this shit all the way to the bottom! As awesome as that would be of course, yet surprising none the less! All the more power to you....!!

Hey, guys? Remember when I said it was 1:30AM? Well it is now 2:30Am....coincidence?? I think not...must toodle, cause well you know....I have to do the bed thing, but not the thing IN the bed....lol! Sleep has been calling to my pea-sized brain, so must go.....NOW!!

Hugs and kisses.....and behave yourselves!

Rose.....but before I go completely, must put one of my "specialized geek quotes"....so here goes nothin!

Oh damn! I can't seem to locate where I put the fucking things so I will have to improvise....Whooohooo!! I found some of them and you will never guess where...of course in the computer desk drawer, huh, go figure eh? That takes brains to do you know...lol! I mean here I was looking everywhere BUT in the desk and below and behold there some were!! What a brainer! I tell ya! Anyway here is one:

Okay, so the ones that I found are not actually mine, but they are good anyway. Apparently mine have gone to a better place......oh and they are kind of lovey, but what the hell, I'm giving it to ya anyway.....

       Welcome to my first blog. I know nothing about this except that I now have my own blog! I'm so excited, (it doesn't take much apparently, ha, ha), but anyway, I really don't know what to say, but I'm going to babble anyway, only cause this is so neat. I'm probably going to talk about my life, but I must warn everyone, it is soooo NOT very exciting. When I was first signing up for this, I tried to use a title that would relate but that didn't work. There is apparently a lot more people who have the same boring type of day to day life. I should warn everyone about something. I tend to babble on and on and on and on, in case you hadn't noticed...lol, but that's just me! I hope I don't offend anyone, not my intention. I am very blunt, so if anyone reads anything I write, please keep that in mind, thanks! I am also from Canada....so it would be nice to talk or hear from people from here also. But not limited to, of course! Now what to say...hmmmm. Wow, I am at a loss for words....that does not come easily to me, anyone who knows me could tell you that. I promise I will try not to yack as much all at once the next time, kay? I'm just beginning, remember?
Well, what I will probably do is make a day-to-day type of diary relating my activities, if I don't get too shy...ha, ha. Like that would happen with me, ya right!
Well that was just unpleasant. I get these damnable chest pains, they drive me crazy. It is something to do with gas, you know, the asophagus....is that how you spell that? Who knows. Anyway, all better now. Gotta go for now, but I will be back. Brace yourselves...lol!
I just heard from one of my very best friends who moved away last summer. She and her family are coming down to visit us for a couple weeks! I cannot tell you how excited I am about this and so is my son! Whooohoooo!!!!
Later.....

       urlLink  About Me   
 
 Hi all my blogger buddies.....if I had any...ha,ha,ha....actually, I have met a couple people who have read my blogs, which was very nice, thank you very much. Anyway, I am trying something new here. I wanted to share with everyone my own basic webpage and when I say basic, I do mean that literally, but to my credit, I just haven't figured out how to change things on it quite yet, but I will learn someday, trust me! I am trying to make a link from here but how to do that on the blogger I haven't quite figured out yet either, but again I will get it down pat soon, hopefully. If you just follow that link above, it should take you their I think, but don't quote me cause well this is me and I'm still a newby as many would call me....so anywho, please go and check it out, it's just one of those freeby things so there isn't going to be a lot of stuff they will allow me to put on it although I did add a link to one other page I go to a lot. It's  www.lovingyou.com . I know what you are thinking. A sappy site and it is kind of that, but there is other things on it like poetry and stories and neat information that might be cool to read. It's no biggie if no one goes to it, it's just somewhere I like to go every now and then. Well, I suppose I don't have much more to say. Wait! I just thought, there is something else. I have a job interview on Wednesday, Aug. 11 at 11:30am. I'm kind of excited about it but at the same time I'm a little nervous, but only because it's been quite a while since I have actually worked. A little over a year to be exact. So you know how it is. That first few minutes at the interview is going to be the toughest for me I think. I haven't even had an interview for over a year. I just hope I don't screw it up royally, cause I am at a very desperate state right now. I mean I NEED, NEED and NEED a job and ASAP!! I had to leave my last job because my husband was really sick, which he still is, but he had medication to take now, which hopefully it will nip this damned depression in the bud and anytime would be nice since he has had this for like 5 or more years now. I guess when people have this it doesn't just go away. It more or less gets medicated so that the emotions can even themselves out somehow, but I have to tell you, this is a really fucked up situation that we are in. But anyway, don't want to babble on about that anymore, it is just way too depressing to have to talk about. So, I guess that's all I have to say for now, but as always, I will be back with more no nonsense stuff to talk about....lol! Toodles for the time being!

        Aug. 6/04,

Well first of all I would just like to thank those of you who commented on my blog. I feel special now, lol!  So if you want me to continue feeling special, please do continue to comment or whatever, thank you!

Now to get on with the rest of my exciting day....but not so much really. You know, it's kind of funny actually cause here it is, just the beginning of August and already my calender is filling up with all this stuff that I have to do, but it all just kind of sneaked up on me, sort of speak, you know? Oh well, at least I will get a lot of shit done that needs to be done, right? Hopefully anyway. So what did I do today. Oh ya, get this. FINALLY, I got my CPR and First Aid certification.....whoohooo! I was quite excited about that, because I have wanted to take the training for a very long time.  I guess I just couldn't be bothered before, but anyway, I am now finishing this on Aug. 7/04......I was sooooo tired last night it wasn't even funny!  I was literally just wiped so I think I passed out like right away.  I kind of told my son that we could go visit his best friends, we moved away from them and we have been really bad with keeping in touch, except on the phone that is.  They just live at the other end of town too.  Two buses will take us right there.  Their mother is one of my very best friends as well so I told her that we would come to see her on the weekend.  Those kids of her's are absolutely wonderful.  I just love them as if they were my own.  They are very well behaved and they are only 8, 9 and 6 years old.  Anyway, enough blabbering about that situation.  I think my husband may have posted this when it wasn't even finished, but luckily I can go and edit these things.  I'm still not sure how to make my posts not look so cluttered.  What I mean is when they are posted the words always look like they are jumbled together, but when I am actually writing them they look fine.....how screwed up is that eh?    
    
  So guess what I had a dream about?  My husband was doing some older woman.  Okay, so I didn't actually see them "doing" it, however, they were in a bed together naked of all the nerve....there were however a couple of kids that were I'm pretty sure in the bed too.  They were on my husband's side.  Now I don't know if they were supposed to be his, but I don't think so.   Well once I got to the bed I just laid into both the trampy little bitch and him too.  I told him I wanted a divorce.....in the dream you fools....lol.  But you should have heard me bitch, bitch, bitch and then bitch again.  It was great!    For a dream I guess....ha, ha, ha....  
  Well that's about it for now, so I will yack back at ya in a bit, or not, who the hell knows....bye for now.  
  P....AKA,  Rose

        Alright look, this is the thing.  Here I am wondering why no one can see my blog posts and it all has to do with the fact that THEY'RE  NOT BEING LISTED IN THE  DAMNED  INDEX  or whatever the hell you call the place people can go to to  browse through everyone else's posts.  It's driving me insane!!  So I finally broke down and sent an email to the blogger support people.  Now hopefully I explained myself clearly enough for them to give me some kind of help.  Watch with my luck  it will turn out that  you have to pay for that luxury....yep, that would be my luck alright....seems to go along with the territory with me almost ALL the time!  Ya right, who am I kidding, it is all the time with me.....so anyway, did I happen to mention that I smoke?  Yes of course JUST cigarettes you crazies...ha,ha,ha.  
  Wow, this is amazing, here I am writing not only one but TWO entries....in the same day!  It would seem that I am getting the knack of this blogging thing and I am sooooo enjoying this....it really is great to be able to just say it however the hell I like.  You gotta love that eh?    
  So, did I also forget to mention that I am finally able to talk to a cousin whom I grew up with and was very close to at the same time, through msn?  If someone out their doesn't have it, I would suggest they download it because it is great to have!  I have had it for quite a while now and they seem to constantly be upgrading it, for some reason, but anyway, it is a great way to stay in touch with people you grew up with or relatives or what not.  It seems that my cousin, Tracy, just realized what a cool tool it is to play around with.  The address is just simply  urlLink www.msn.com  if anyone is interested.  It takes like 2 minutes to download, depending on the speed of your internet connection or download speed, whichever.  I'm going to assume the reason it took Tracy so long to find it is because she is just too busy to play on the computer.  She is a real estate agent after all so she is always on the go, you know?  She is soooo great!  I just love her to death.  I sometimes wished I lived back in Lindsay so I could stay in touch with my family, but as we all know, things happen that can't be helped, right?  I think I will give her my blogspot url so she can read all about my boring life...ha, ha, ha!  
  But anyway, I think I have babbled enough for tonight.....so I'm running away now....lol!  If by some miracle anyone does read any of my posts, I would love a response  or comment or anything actually.... Do I sound pathetic or what eh?     
  Well toodles.....I really am running away now, but you know I will be back....again and again and again....lol!  Try not to miss me too much!

  Well as is my title of this blog, I am just trying to stay in touch with everyone, not that anyone has even tried to respond to anything I have said....boohoo....lol!  That's okay, I will just have to keep this blog thing up to date.  Maybe that will help, who knows?  So, I cannot stress enough how BORING a day this has been!  I mean, I'm about ready to go insane in this dinky little apt.  My son has been really good for most of the day, which is an extra bonus....however, he is beginning to give attitude....but I made it quite clear that I will not have any of his mouth....way to go Pam...ha, ha!  You see, the friends that he used to play with has now moved so he has been quite bored and driving his father and I a little nuts.  I mean, the child won't even go outside and it's been very nice outside.  I cannot tell you how  anxious we are for school to start again in Sept.  It's hard to do anything with him or take him places when there is no damned money to do it with.  Luckily he is going over to his friends new place tomorrow for the night.  We are looking forward to that let me tell ya!  His friends still live here in London, they've just moved to different ends of it, that's all.  But anyway, that's enough yammering about that topic for now.  You know, I really wish we could move from here, to a townhouse again, like we were in before this place.  It's so damned shitty that we had to move from one form of a house to an apt.  If life doesn't get any better soon I think I might lose my mind totally.  Not working or having money sure does make life crappy to live.  It's hard enough just to make ends meet as it is, with the little amount of money we have coming in.  And you know what is the worst part of all this?  My son.  He is the one who is suffering the most.  His life was turned right upside down when his dad was diagnosed with some form of depression, with all the problems and situations that just keep popping up.  It is really hard and no one could ever really understand what I am going through.  I was not intending on sounding so depressing on here...wow, that was pretty damned sad.....lol!  This blog thing might just turn out alright.  Especially if I can just yack to the air with no one to tell me to keep it all to myself.  I am still fairly new at this thing, so I am "technically" just getting used to all the different things I can do with it.  It really is cool.  You know, it seems wether I have nothing or something to say I can still babble on and on and on can't I?  Hmmm, strange, but me, that's all I can say.  Well, I have decided that I might, might just post some of my poetry or stories on here, just to see what people think, if someone says anything that is.  It's okay, I'm open to any and all kinds of criticism....is that how you spell that? Hmm, not sure but I think so.  Well, I think I've just about run out of things to say. Oh no, there is more.  My husband and I are going to look for apts. or something tomorrow, after we drop off our son to his friends house.  If we could move from this hell hole ASAP that would be great, but of course the key word is "if" isn't it?    I've been trying to figure out what it is I want to do with myself, as in job wise or whatever, so I want to  see about going to a career directions type of workshop.  I have an information session to go to come this wednesday, so we will see what comes of it. If I decide to go to it, it will be a 10 week program to see what I want to do with myself.  Hopefully it will set me straight sort of speak....  
  You know what I think?  I think I was meant to be rich, but I'm just not sure how it is supposed to happen.  isn't that the silliest thing?  Well it's just that I seem to want everything and I have expensive taste in stuff, although I still am cheap, to a certain point.  Of course when I say I want everything, that only means like the regular stuff.  Like a car, a house or home to call my own, a bit of money in the bank, that sort of thing, a regular job or something.  It just doesn't seem fair, but then again, who ever said life was fair, right?  Exactly.  Aww well, maybe I will have a better day tomorrow, who knows?  Or maybe later on tonight.  I might come back and sound a lot more positive.....but for now, I think I'm outta here...

       I know. I am a sad, sad woman. Here I am with no life, apparently, writing ridiculous emails to people who probably don't even know they are getting all this crap...! Oh well, what can I say? I thought I would share with everyone my stupidity....lol Below you will find two emails I sent to David Boreanaz (Angel from the show Angel). Okay, so they are not really going to end up at his "personal" email, it's just a website that really stupid people can use to post shit. They are pathetic so I thought I would give everyone a good laugh...sure, way to go Pam, make yourself look even more ridiculous.....Ahh what the hell! Don't worry, I am not so naive to think that these will ACTUALLY be read by him, hell no, I just found this silly website...it's called: www.celebrityemail.com......if anyone would like to read any of the really stupid stuff. Beleive me, as ridiculous as what I wrote is, you would be completely flabbergasted by what other people have written! It was absolutely nuts, but then again, I get the impression that it is usually younger people who write on these stupid sites, so of course being 33 I couldn't resist.....lol! I am not denying that I am a fan because I am. I'm just not an insane one, that's all. Come on ladies and even some men, there is no denying how incredibly sexy that man is....I mean he is one very very attractive man. I mean really, have you SEEN the guy's body? Hot, hot, hot and then hot! And those eyes? Damn! You could drown in them, over and over again. Okay, I better stop blabbering or else people are going to stop believing my non-obsessiveness crap...lol! Oh, by the way, if anyone knows how to put some links on my blogger, I would appreciate any information on how to do it...thanks! Also, any pictures too....thanks again! Gotta go for now, but I'll be back......unfortunately....ha,ha, ha.

P.....aka, Rose



 SUBJECT: Me Being Pathetic...ha, ha  
  
Dear Mr. Boreanaz,  
  
I absolutely know that this is a pretty pathetic thing to do, especially for a grown woman, but hey, that would be me. It is however, 2:30am where I am from, in Canada. I really do feel ridiculous doing this and if my husband knew what I was doing he would probably laugh his a** off and never let me live it down. He would call me obsessed. I must confess I do enjoy watching you on Angel and well basically everything else. What can I say? Your very pleasing to a woman's eye, no matter what age. And I am proof of that because here I am, 33 years old with an 8 year old son, who, I might add watches your show as well, not to mention he loves to re-enact you on the show. It's quite cute actually, but anyway, my message here is likely to get cut short because I have this horrible habit of babbling about which is quite obvious....if right now is any indication. I did a commercial for an Australian airline a while back and I did a modelling stint in an adult magazine, though not the popular ones. I'm not sure why I just said that....but oh well. Well I guess I can't write to you directly because get this, you have to pay a monthly fee to get your email address or whatever, go figure eh? It's probably not even any "REAL" addresses. If you do get this message by some strange coincidence, I should mention that you can read more about me on my blogger site. The address is: girlfrompontypool.blogspot.com, if you are interested. I suppose I really do sound a bit pathetic here don't I? Well I don't mean to talk about me so much, sorry. I would like you to know that I believe you to be a great talent and I forsee big things in your future now that Angel has been cancelled, which I was soooo sorry to hear, but the good news is, I am buying all the dvd sets of Angel. I'm dying to get season 4. It hasn't come out yet, at least not in Canada, but when it does, I'll be getting it! Well I must go now, so take care and good luck in the future! You really are a great actor and I picture you as a great, down to earth type of man....but then who am I to say that right? Leave me alone, I'm fantasizing again...lol! That is the whole point to this isn't it? I really do not expect you to answer or even read this but I just wanted to tell you or whoever what I think of you and your talent, so thanks for reading, whoever you are! Pam L

 SUBJECT: Here I go Again..... 
 
 Dear Mr. Boreanaz,  
   
  It is just Pam again, being a pain in the a** once more....lol. I heard the funniest story about how you landed the part of Angel on Buffy....apparently you were walking your dog and someone just "happend" upon you, because of your tall, dark and handsome looks. I think that is so great. It's about time someone noticed your talent isn't it? I just wish I had of remembered your first television appearance, on Married with Children. I used to watch that show very regularly. That would have been awesome! I know you obviously would have had to work very hard to get where you are today, but I still think it was great how you were noticed...just my personal opinion. I'm not sure if anyone will be able to read this, like maybe an assistant of David's but if someone does get the chance to read this I wanted to tell you that I would be very interested in starting an "Official" Canadian fan club for David Boreanaz, but I am not quite sure how to go about it so if someone has any opinions on the subject I would appreciate some information on how to do it. I thought I would like to have a FanFiction section as well, based on the show Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but also I would like to be able to give all his Canadian fans something to talk about and write about, if at all possible. So if anyone has any ideas I would love to hear them, thanks! Keep up the good work David Boreanaz! Pam (again)
