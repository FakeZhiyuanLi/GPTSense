      Last night the chilis played at Hyde park in London. The gig was also played on Radio 1 with Zane Lowe presenting an interview and the gig. What can I say, the chilis rocked to the extreme, they played all the classics and the crowd were singing along, so was i as i surfed the net.      right martins a fuckin cretin, i insult his momma and he hits me with a wooden ruler dammit, wheres my holepunch when i need it? also martin stinx,he stank out my room with a homemade brew of lamb curry - bastard.     back to the chilis, they rocked - what more can be said or expected from the legends that are the chilis. peace out peeps.

      lets see it started with me and mart getting there at bout 6:45 when we ate food. Then we watched a bit of Faces of Death - which was Darrens idea- until we realised that this was not fun and hence not a party. So we then listened to music for a while b4 people began to play drinkin games and gettin pissed - esp Darren. There was a lot of homosexuality goin on between cameron martin and a very frightened darren. darren was also in shock of hearing the, now infamous, condom conversation first heard at Download, and imagining martin and claire *cough**coughing*.>_> I feel kinda sorry for darren - he stayed over the night, i wonder where he ended up sleeping.  Carnival 2day, joy. Got £11 now, 1/4 of the way to gettin these boots that ive seen in a catologue.

      What was the point? First match Greece vs Portugal with Greece winning. Last match Greece vs Portugal with Greece winning. Why did we bother?
