						   When I was young, I lived in the country on a farm about 3 miles from town. There were no children to play with aside from my sisters, but I didnt mind too much. I was more of a reader than an outdoors kind of child. I rode my bike a lot...but never did much camping or fishing or stuff like that. At the time I didnt mind.  Right now tho, I'm really getting into nostalgia and life from say late 1800s to about 1960. I've purchased quite a few books lately on life back then. How to make items for the farm and home...wildfood, hunting, fishing, scouts....and a part of me kinda yearns for that. Growing up I wasnt in scouts. I dont think there were boy scouts but I do remember there were cub scouts in Crewe. I went camping when I was in Royal Ambassadors at my church but I really dont remember too much about it.  I look at my nephew Sam and am kinda envious. He's the kinda boy that a part of me wishes I could have been. I was never much a hunter. I remember killing a small bird with my BB gun and I cried over killing him. Guess I was too soft hearted.  At least with the books I can somehow learn what life was like and could have been like. To be a child again.....

						   I'd rather be in Carolina ;). Seriously, I am sorry that I did not have a chance to go down to NC this weekend and see my oldest nephew graduate from Junior High. I cant believe he is getting so old! Only yesterday he was this tiny little thing in my arms and now he's taller than me. He's a good kid with good parents and I know he will continue to do well.  I havent bought the recorder yet. I'm mixed as to whether getting the digital or the cassette type. It will be some time before I can do the interviews tho, so there is no rush. I have however been checking out various websites and have gotten some tips on what to ask and how to conduct the interview.  Tommorrow (Saturday) will be yard work and try to clean this house! I am making slow progress, figure if i get it presentable, i will hire a cleaning service to come in 1, 2 a month and keep it clean for me.  Work. I have to say filling in for Phil this week was good. I spent the entire week in the Bubble (normally I'm there only M, Thu, Fri). I can really handle it myself solo if need be. JT was out most of Wednesday doing union stuff and the guy they had with me today (Tony) hadnt been there in weeks (not his fault). I know this will sound egotistical, but I believe I am the best person for that duty. No offense to JT, but he has to spend a lot of time on union stuff and his schedule isnt reliable from day to day. No offense to Phil, but I do do more than him in their. It isnt his fault tho, he has a lot of health problems and the medications he is on make him very drowsy in the afternoon.  I kinda wish they would put me down there M-F. Its more technical than anything else I usually do there.

						   I'm getting interested in doing interviews with relatives on things they remember from their early years...and things that their parents/grandparents told them. How life was like on the farm...home remedies, building their own farm implements, folk sayings, folk recipies, etc.  I'm wanting to buy a voice recorder. I've eliminated micro cassettes as they are too expensive. That leaves standard cassettes and digital. Standard: cassettes available, instant archive. More complex to digitize and store in computer. Lower initial cost.  Digital: higher original cost. No need to buy media...ever. Easier on some models to transfer to computer.  I am leaning to the Olympus DS-330 model. Online $99, in store about $129 plus tax.   I am looking forward to tapping mom and dad's memories. Mom suggested Eva Barker (Dad's cousin) as one to talk to. Even tho she is in her 90s, mom says she has a wonderful memory.   I just wish I had talked to grandma, grandpa and mimmaw more and some of grandaddy's siblings (Aunt Jackie, Aunt Snow, etc...). I envision making these interviews and burning them to cd for posterity. Maybe mixing in photographs for a multimedia experience. Should be fun.

						   I've seen many mentions of blogs but never really understood what they are. However, after seeing what a member of an old time radio group I belong in did, I decided to give it a whirl.  I hope to put down thoughts on some of my hobbies: woodcarving, old time radio, history, reading. Right now, I'm getting interested in folk life, folk lore, what people did, how they lived a century or more ago.  I'll put stuff about family here as well. Who knows, maybe it will be easier to keep up with family info and communications.  Anyway, for a first post, we'll end it now and check back later.
