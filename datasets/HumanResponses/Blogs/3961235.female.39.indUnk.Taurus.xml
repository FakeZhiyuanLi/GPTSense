       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   I am happy to discover there are Jeff Buckley fans out there. Also there are haters but those particular people seem to hate everything anyway.  I've had several good My Bloody Valentine discussions via email since mentioning them a few days back. These people have discovered that even though I love them so much, I really don't know that much about them! I have been making it my business to read up on them some. But really, I am far from expert. One of the reasons is that I was told by a reliable source not to even bother with any MBV from the pre-Bilinda Butcher days, that it simply wasn't good and not worth the money. Well two people via email had plenty to say about that so maybe I should try it out? One reader sneered "after all, its Kevin Shields who's the talent" but I beg to differ on that. Its my understanding that Bilinda wrote most of her own shit, for  Loveless  anyway ,  and those are some really good songs .  They would stand on their own even without the MBV "sound".  When I first bought  Loveless,  I was all pissed off .  I thought it sucked the big one. I first listened to it at work on the little CD player and I listened all the way through respectfully, just like I always do everything else. But then I was all pissed off because I had even spent money on the thing, I found it to be almost unlistenable. So I took it out and shoved it in my desk drawer and that was that. Or was it? Because that night I woke up in the middle of the night with one little melody from it looping around and around in my head (I can't remember which one it was now). Laying there in the dark, I suddenly understood it was really a beautiful thing.  So I go back to work the next day and I find myself looking forward to hearing that little snippet of music again. And me being who I am, I just go ahead and give the whole thing another run. And then understanding dawned on me, it was like seeing the light. The beginning of a love affair that will never end.  MBV (and  Loveless ) taught me how to listen to music in a whole different way. I loved digging into the different layers of sound and picking out the sounds that appealed most to me, then putting them all back together as a whole. And then there is the vocals. Bilinda truly has the voice of an angel, she's really almost too good to be true. I love Kevin's voice too, although I enjoy his more on  Isn't Anything,  he has that cute "British Boy" accent going on. And the main thing I've learned is.... it doesn't matter what they're singing .   I learned to appreciate vocals as a sound more than what is being said. You know, there is at least one website out there that attempts the lyrics to  Loveless  and     I looked up "To Here Knows When"...and I'm sorry but I don't hear the same thing as what that person was transcribing. In fact, I HATED the lyrics that person had transcribed and it hit me that the only thing that was important is what I imagined in my head about the song. I wanted it to mean what I wanted it to mean and nothing else. So I've never looked up another lyric and don't intend to. I'm content with identifying the occasional word or phrase and the only important thing is the "ooh"'s anyway, right?  And here is where I am going to piss some people off, but Smashing Pumpkins first couple of records was nothing more than a bad MBV imitation. IMHO. Billy Corgan wanted to be Kevin Shields, and wanted it very badly. So there. Get all pissed off. Write to me and let's fight it out.  My Bloody Valentine, like Jeff Buckley, is almost too good to live. But instead of dying like Jeff and the others, they just never did anything else. I guess when you've achieved the best there's no where to go but down? I heard that Deb Googe, the bass player, ended up driving a cab after MBV failed to do anything else. Incredible but you gotta make a living, right?  Important trivial information: Saturday is the second moon of this month, called the Blue Moon. To witches, this is just as good as Halloween for spells and stuff like that. I like reading the Farmer's Almanac and since the Blue Moon only comes around once in a blue moon (ba ha), I'll definately be checking it out.

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com    Why do the best rock stars always have to die?&nbsp; You know the stories....Buddy Holly, Janis Joplin,&nbsp;Jimi Hendrix, Brian Jones, Freddie Mercury, John Bonham, Kurt Cobain....that whole crowd.&nbsp; Well, Jeff Buckley was a part of that crowd.&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of you not&nbsp;familiar with Jeff, I&nbsp;recommend you put getting to know his music on your to-do list.&nbsp;&nbsp; Except for you headbangers and metal freaks.&nbsp; Jeff was definately&nbsp;not quite in that category.&nbsp;   Jeff &nbsp;was a great artist.&nbsp; He was totally into the music for the music's sake.&nbsp; His father was Tim Buckley, a cult-following artist kind of&nbsp;a guy who was quite talented.&nbsp; He died&nbsp;of&nbsp;a drug overdose&nbsp;when he was 28 years old.&nbsp; I have one of Tim Buckley's CDs and its really good though a lot of it does sound dated...you know, that beloved 1960's sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was pretty good though.&nbsp; Then here comes Jeff who in my humble opinion blew his dad away in terms of just how good he was.&nbsp; I'll reverse my opinion&nbsp;when I'm eighty if I go back and listen to "Live at Sin-e" and it&nbsp;sounds dated...but I don't think that's going to happen.&nbsp;   Jeff was a free spirit kind of guy.&nbsp; He was out with a&nbsp;friend of his by the (I think) Mississippi River in 1997,&nbsp;they&nbsp;had a guitar and they were singing.&nbsp; One assumes they had probably been partying, maybe drinking or&nbsp;smoking some weed or something.&nbsp; That part is never&nbsp;made too clear.&nbsp; Well all of a&nbsp;sudden Jeff&nbsp;gets up and still wearing all his clothes, goes for a swim in the river.&nbsp; He's having the time of his life out there, laughing and singing.&nbsp; His friend gets up to move the guitar and their other stuff and when he looks back, Jeff is gone.&nbsp; He just went&nbsp;under the water and didn't come&nbsp;back up for like 6 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a realist,&nbsp;I know he probably just passed out but there's something in me that wants to believe that something more really&nbsp;happened.    Jeff takes a deep breath and dives&nbsp;under water.&nbsp; To his surprise, he&nbsp;has entered a parallel universe dimension underwater!&nbsp; And look who's swimming his way over...its the Grim Reaper!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Grim :&nbsp; What up, Jeff?   Jeff :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well...nothing much.&nbsp; Just hanging out, you know. &nbsp;What's happening here?   Grim :&nbsp; Isn't it obvious, Jeff?&nbsp; You do know who I am, don't you?   Jeff :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You kind of look like the Grim Reaper.   Grim :&nbsp; That's me!&nbsp; And your number is up, buddy.&nbsp; Time to go with me.   Jeff :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait!&nbsp; I don't understand!&nbsp; Did I do something wrong?&nbsp;   Grim :&nbsp; You bet your cute little rock star-boy ass you did&nbsp;something wrong!&nbsp; You know&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your&nbsp;rock and&nbsp;roll history boy!&nbsp; Buddy&nbsp;Holly, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Brian Jones, Freddie Mercury, John Bonham, Kurt&nbsp;Cobain....you know the drill.&nbsp; Now, come on.   Jeff :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what did I do wrong?&nbsp; What did THEY do wrong?&nbsp; Those other stars?   Grim :&nbsp; Isn't it obvious???&nbsp; Well, I'll explain it to you then.&nbsp; You see, to sum it all up in one sentence, Jeff...you and those other rock stars, well, you're just  too&nbsp;good  to live!&nbsp;   Jeff :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WTF??   Grim :&nbsp; Its true, Jeff.&nbsp; Let's look at your life.&nbsp; You've dedicated your life to the making of beautiful music, not making a shitload of&nbsp;money.&nbsp; You write&nbsp;meaningful music that touches the hearts of those who take the time to listen.&nbsp; You use your voice as an instrument...a beautiful instrument and yeah, you do get a little melodramatic sometimes, but the chicks dig that.&nbsp; Your lyrics are instrospective and real.&nbsp; You play from the soul.&nbsp;   Jeff :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well...thanks, but...   Grim :&nbsp;&nbsp;Face it Jeff,&nbsp;you're just too good to live.&nbsp; You're messing up the status quo.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of you, there is some mediocre-run-of-the-mill-dime-a-dozen&nbsp;dude who&nbsp;might not get crammed down the throats of the public.&nbsp; Why should we celebrate your profound talent when there is the likes of Three Doors Down or Nickelback who we can promote instead?&nbsp; Bland bands who will have a long, lucrative career and live practically forever!&nbsp; Think about it dude!&nbsp; All those other rock stars were at the top of the heap...the best of the best.&nbsp; Well, we just&nbsp;can't be having it.&nbsp; Time to die, buddy.&nbsp; Now follow me and I'll take you to the man upstairs...   Jeff :&nbsp; Shit, if music is&nbsp;going to end up that&nbsp;mediocre in the 21st century, I don't want to live anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's go&nbsp;party, Grim!&nbsp; You da man! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And with that, Jeff&nbsp;Buckley went to rock and roll heaven where he happily resides.&nbsp; He's in&nbsp;charge of the beautiful singing of the angels that people hear as they&nbsp;pass away to their final reward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I'LL ACCEPT THAT HE WAS TOO GOOD TO BE ON THE EARTH BUT IF JEFF BUCKLEY AIN'T SINGING IN HEAVEN,&nbsp;I DON'T WANNA GO!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Mail updates:&nbsp; Thanks for the couple of&nbsp;cheer up emails I got.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just get that way sometimes and I&nbsp;figure its best to just roll with it till I get out of the funk.&nbsp; Smell the funk, ya'll!&nbsp;   To the person wondering about my sick goose at the park....I never saw him again after that one day when he seemed better.&nbsp; And I didn't find a body, so that's encouraging.&nbsp; I still look for him but when you're looking at 1,050 Canadian geese...well, they just all kind of look alike.&nbsp; He was missing an eye though, so I should be able to spot him again if he's spottable.   Congratulations to the anonymous person who guessed that song "In the Year 2525" (which I misidentified as '3535'....whatever).&nbsp; Its by Zager and Evans!&nbsp; Yeah, I knew that!&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Well I just hate that this person is too scared to send me their snail mail address because they would have won a prize.&nbsp; I was thinking of sending the winner my cable bill but oh well....your loss, buddy.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com    The answer is yes, there is intelligence but maybe not quite as much as you would like to have in your planet's leader.&nbsp; Let me explain.   When you're in school, you take a lot of tests.&nbsp; And eventually there comes a time when you take the IQ tests.&nbsp; It was my fate to have my IQ tested several times and I also consistently scored in the  top&nbsp;one third! &nbsp; Now that sounds impressive, doesn't it?&nbsp; Well its not....when you take into consideration that I consistently scored in the BOTTOM of that one third.&nbsp; Every&nbsp;single time.&nbsp; That means that basically one third of  all people  are smarter than me.&nbsp; And that's a lot of people!&nbsp;   My high school did a ranking&nbsp;of the class students (maybe all high schools do?&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows?) and I came in at 78.&nbsp;&nbsp;The top one third of the class...but the bottom of that one third.&nbsp; There were 77 people doing better than me and&nbsp;I was kicking ass in high school!&nbsp; That's quite a humbling feeling when you are doing the absolute best you can and you're still not there.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   At this point I won't bore you with&nbsp;my SAT scores.&nbsp; But I did had a blast the night before having a smooch session with......I won't tell you that either!&nbsp; HA   So my point is this....yeah, I'm pretty smart but I'm just smart enough to know that I SHOULD be smarter.&nbsp; Its a really tortured kind of smartness.&nbsp; And I know if I could just FOCUS a little harder I could be smarter but its probably not going to happen unless I can somehow lower my stress level.&nbsp; If I were rich I could be smarter.&nbsp; And wouldn't we all?   But I am thankful for the intelligence I do have.&nbsp; I have lots of common sense and intuition.&nbsp; And I praise the Lord above for my way above-average b.s. detector.&nbsp; Yeah, you might fool me for awhile...but eventually you tell on yourself.&nbsp; If&nbsp;you look like a turd, smell like a turd, act like a turd....by God you MUST be a&nbsp;turd.&nbsp; Its as simple that.&nbsp; If you have a reasonably reliable&nbsp;b.s. detector and the Serenity Prayer... you're going to make it in life.&nbsp; Everything else can go in the garbage.&nbsp;&nbsp;And as that ancient wise philosopher Axl Rose one said..."Take that one to heart."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com    I'm pretty sure that one&nbsp;day the world as we know it will end.&nbsp; Everyone says so...the Bible, Nostradamus, Cayce, all the&nbsp;great seers of&nbsp;history.&nbsp; And they all said it would end right around the year 2000 or so.&nbsp; I can't think of any great diviners that&nbsp;divined much happening&nbsp;after the 21st century rolled around.&nbsp; Well, there was&nbsp;that one song....I don't know the name, but it&nbsp;goes "In the year 3535"........(If you can name who&nbsp;sung that, you might win a prize!&nbsp; Emphasis on MIGHT.&nbsp; You'd have to send me your mailing address~ HA!&nbsp;).   Anyways, here it is the 21st century and there's  absolutely no sign  of the world ending.&nbsp; Well&nbsp;other than&nbsp;that pesky&nbsp;little war threatening to turn&nbsp;into a world conflict, Aids, famine, natural disasters, pollution and the general waning of regard for human life as a whole.&nbsp; But other than&nbsp;that there's absolutely no sign of the world ending!&nbsp;   What I think the great seers of history were actually seeing was the end of the Internet.&nbsp; The period of great turmoil they all opined was in fact the&nbsp;spread of the Internet to all&nbsp;over the world, to all classes of people.&nbsp; This is considered turmoilic (is that a word?) &nbsp;because most of the world's peoples were not used to&nbsp;words like "kewl"&nbsp; and "rotflmao".&nbsp; There was mass confusion as Internet users began to&nbsp;realize that there&nbsp;are actually people out there that care only about things like Limp Bizkit or whether or not Mary Kate Olsen has carbs or proteins for lunch.&nbsp; We were a people united, yet we were&nbsp;also alienated.&nbsp; But we overcame our differences and learned to love this Internet world.&nbsp; Internet - good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Real life responsibilities - bad.&nbsp;   Then came the Hackers.&nbsp; Yeah, they were always there but then young 12 and 13 year old boys joined the fold.&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the day, the young boys were content to throw some toilet paper into your trees...or maybe even spray paint a "fuck off" or two on&nbsp;some bridge.&nbsp; But once we gave them a keyboard it was on to&nbsp;Total World Domination.&nbsp; They began&nbsp;inventing viruses and&nbsp;email worms.&nbsp; Computer systems all over the world were crippled&nbsp;or totally shut down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospitals&nbsp;everywhere struggled to meet the demand of Internet Junkies who were unable to logon and&nbsp;get their fix.&nbsp; Even worse, there were mass suicides as people began looking away from their screens and realized the house hadn't been cleaned up since October of 1998 and that their kids&nbsp;had managed to graduate high school without the parents ever knowing they'd left the house.&nbsp; Order would soon be restored, though, by Norton's Antivirus and other saviors of the Internet Way of Life.&nbsp;   But the Hackers became even more competitive.&nbsp; If they couldn't shut down the Internet, they would flood it with&nbsp;virus&nbsp;after virus.&nbsp; Once again computers ground to a&nbsp;slow&nbsp;crawl.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some enterprising young fellows created Adware and Spyware and was able to legally strangle computers just like ivy on a tree.&nbsp; Then they charged you money to buy the software to get rid of it!   Finally along came the Mother of All Hackers.&nbsp; He was a Super Nerd Extreme.&nbsp; He was so smart that you could see his brain pulsating under his scalp.&nbsp; And then he did It.&nbsp; He wrote the program that effectively shut down the Internet for good.&nbsp;   So where am I going with this?&nbsp; Nowhere, of course.&nbsp; What's the&nbsp;use?&nbsp; Even if I tell you what happens your computer is going to be too damn slow to finish reading the story.&nbsp;&nbsp;My computer is probably going to be too slow to publish this blog today so you'll probably never read it anyway.&nbsp;   We're Doomed, I tell you.&nbsp; Doomed.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com    First of all, let me&nbsp;explain.&nbsp; I have a ratty-ass car.&nbsp; Now I'm not complaining...its a&nbsp;good car....on the inside.&nbsp; The outside is a whole other story.&nbsp; I have all this peeling paint because the kitties sleep all over&nbsp;it and scratch the paint with their&nbsp;claws.&nbsp; Plus I lost a&nbsp;hub-cap...I don't remember how that happened.&nbsp; Now, I could really care less...I&nbsp;just don't care.&nbsp; Maybe its a personality flaw.&nbsp; I didn't inherit the "pride in car" gene.&nbsp; As long as I get to&nbsp;where I'm going in reasonable safety,&nbsp;it just doesn't matter!&nbsp;   But&nbsp;lately I've begun noticing a new phenomena.&nbsp; Whenever I'm out&nbsp;running errands in the car, homeless guys&nbsp;are totally into me.&nbsp; They stare at me and they don't ask for change, they just stare.&nbsp; I guess they see me in my ratty-ass car and think...."now there's a gal who's just one step away from homeless!&nbsp; That's the girl for me!"&nbsp; It doesn't happen if I'm somewhere without my car and I see a homeless person.&nbsp; Then they just want change.&nbsp; But let me be in that car and its a whole different story.&nbsp;   Other strange phenomena:&nbsp; The park where I go walking every day is near a retirement community.&nbsp; I really like those old people around there and I feel safe walking there alone.&nbsp; But I can't help but notice whenever I'm near the main building.....there have been plenty of wheelchair ramps built for these people...but they all go uphill at dangerously steep levels.&nbsp; Now if the person is lucky enough to have a motorized wheelchair or someone to push them - no&nbsp;problem.&nbsp; But otherwise, you'd better have some ripped deltoids or your never going to get your ass up that ramp.&nbsp; I don't particularly want to live to be too old anyway but&nbsp;it might happen.&nbsp; I&nbsp;refuse to be a recluse simply because I can't get my&nbsp;wheelchair where I need&nbsp;it to go.&nbsp; Starting today I am beginning a new regimen to&nbsp;gain upper body&nbsp;strength.&nbsp; Let's see, I'm 39 and if I keep it going, I should resemble what Arnold Schwarzenneger (sp?) used to look like by the time I'm&nbsp;69.&nbsp; Then you won't be able to keep me down!&nbsp;   Which brings me to the next strange phenomena....my Aunt, "Earrings".&nbsp;&nbsp; Now she's really sweet but I don't understand how her mind works.&nbsp; I had breakfast with her on Saturday and somehow the conversation was turned to exercise.&nbsp; And Aunt Earrings informed both me and Sunrise that if you exercise daily, you will wear your body out.&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; Yep, daily exercise is not good for you because then when you are 69 your body will be too worn out to get that wheelchair up the ramp.&nbsp; Well, there's&nbsp;all the excuse I need to just go back to bed!&nbsp; Don't want to&nbsp;overdo it.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   To the Inquiring Mind who was wondering if that was an embedded My Bloody Valentine lyric in my post yesterday....why yes, it was a My Bloody Valentine lyric that I embedded in there.&nbsp; And I looooove My Bloody Valentine.&nbsp; I only have "Loveless", "Glider" ep, and "Isn't Anything" because I heard the others&nbsp;before Bilinda Butcher just aren't that good.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Inquiring Mind, if you think you might know anything about MBV that I don't know, please write back and give me the entire scoop.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you think I probably know it already, write anyway, because I could go off about them for an hour or so and write a short thesis.&nbsp; I do know Kevin Shields has like 4 new&nbsp;songs on the "Lost in Translation" soundtrack but I haven't bought it yet.&nbsp; He won some kind of English music award for that work but whether he won it because it was so great or he won it because everyone was so relieved he actually put out some music after 14 years...well, that remains to be seen.&nbsp; I think he's probably insane....a mad, mad genius and&nbsp;I love him.&nbsp;   And speaking of mad geniuses....one of Sparkle's friends came over yesterday, grabbed her guitar and put on a concert!&nbsp; My God, he was&nbsp;jamming out and he was sooo good.&nbsp; He was playing some Hendrix and some Priest and stuff...I'm sure some of that was for my&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;but I was quite appreciative.&nbsp; What a talented kid! &nbsp;I wanted to ask him if he was reincarnated or something but I never got around to it.&nbsp; He&nbsp;is definately some kind of 70's throwback.&nbsp; If I ever do give Sparkle that sweet 16 party I'm thinking about...he's the kid that's going to play.&nbsp; Drum and bass actually wouldn't be necessary.&nbsp; &nbsp;   And I want to close out on&nbsp;a&nbsp;much sadder note:&nbsp; I would like to ask any readers to say a prayer for Lori Hacking's family.&nbsp; I really don't think girlfriend is going to be found alive and its so incredibly sad.&nbsp; Those poor parents look exhausted and totally confused.&nbsp; Please God give them your&nbsp;power to stay strong and to deal with whatever happens.&nbsp; Also God, please make your presence and power known to the husband...so that he will come forward and at least tell what he knows.&nbsp; And one last thing&nbsp;God, help me find a way to not feel so helpless about it all.&nbsp; Please&nbsp;help me focus my sorrow into some kind of positive action.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com    Boy, it sure doesn't take much to get you people in an uproar!&nbsp; I received several emails galore....all of them pertaining to the small but important fact that I find Rob Halford to be a sexy man.&nbsp; If I had known it was going to be this easy to piss you off, I would have gotten started from my very first&nbsp;blog-in.   Here's what one rocket scientist had to say, "Brenda, you think Rob Halford is sexy.&nbsp; You must be a lesbian."&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; First of all, I just want to point out that I had to edit 3&nbsp;spelling errors before I posted Rocket Scientist's note.&nbsp; Let me try to break this down to the basics as much as I can so RS can understand.  * Cue in "Circle of Life" music from the The Lion King *  Okay sweetie, its like this....  Woman finds straight man attractive = straight woman  Woman finds GAY man attractive = that's still a straight woman!&nbsp;  What makes&nbsp;a person&nbsp;gay is what the person themselves are actually doing...not what the attractive person is doing.&nbsp; In short,&nbsp;I would have to be having gay sex to be considered&nbsp;gay....does this make any sense at all?&nbsp; Its pretty simple when you think about it.&nbsp; Thanks for writing!   Whew, I'm glad that's settled.&nbsp; Okay, on to the next letter.&nbsp; Another guy here:&nbsp; "You think he's sexy all you want but I guarantee you'll never get any of it."&nbsp; And just how do you know?&nbsp; I might be the woman he's been waiting his whole life for!&nbsp; Seriously though....I bet you think Pamela Anderson is sexy and I bet you'll never get any of that, either.&nbsp; But that doesn't stop you from thinking she's sexy, does it?&nbsp;   What really amazes me is this mindset that gay people belong in a huge holding pen and&nbsp;straight people should&nbsp;ignore the fact that they exist.&nbsp; Come on, you guys....gayness is not SPREADING.&nbsp; There is nothing to be&nbsp;afraid of!!&nbsp; You can't be gay if you don't want to be gay...unless maybe you're Anne Heche, but that's another story.   And finally, there was this gem in the&nbsp;inbox...."Brenda, I am happy to know that a straight girl can think a gay man is attractive even if she knows he is gay.&nbsp; I am a gay male and been with my lover for&nbsp;6 years.&nbsp; He is very good-looking and also bi-sexual.&nbsp; He&nbsp;has&nbsp;been interested in doing a threesome with a female for quite some time.&nbsp; He is a gentle lover with a huge dick I&nbsp;know you would be impressed.&nbsp; I want to do this for him but I would prefer with someone who has respect for gay people as you seem to be.&nbsp; Please email me. &nbsp;Thank you, Luis."&nbsp;   Luis...thank you very much for the invitation but......no.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; *Lays head on desk*&nbsp; Did this kind of thing go on BEFORE the internet?&nbsp;   Here on Planet Brenda, you actually have to get to know me IN REAL LIFE before I would ever have sex with you.&nbsp; You would&nbsp;have to take me on some&nbsp;DATES and maybe find out if we have THINGS&nbsp;IN COMMON.&nbsp; I know this is an unusual concept for this day and time....thus&nbsp;I spend many Saturday nights at home.&nbsp; But seriously....from&nbsp;here on out all email invitations for random sex will be deleted....so don't send any.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;   However,&nbsp;DO continue to send those unsolicited stories of your sexual adventures.&nbsp; They are very funny and some of them are quite well-written. &nbsp;Its always nice to know what my audience is up to.&nbsp; Kind of, I guess.   Damn, why&nbsp;can't you people get&nbsp;this worked up over the chicken abuse&nbsp;or the prevention of senseless killings of spouses?&nbsp;&nbsp;With all that energy we might actually make a difference in the world.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   Okay, I've been&nbsp;just a  little&nbsp; down in the dumps the past few days.&nbsp; To perk myself up, I am going to list all the things I have loved about the past 24 hours.&nbsp;    Sparkle.&nbsp; The fact that she lives, breathes, exists.&nbsp; The fact that she seems pretty happy.&nbsp; The fact she made it to high school!!  The fact that my car started this morning and not only that, but got me to work safely.  The fact that my car has a CD player in it.   The fact that my&nbsp;CD player&nbsp;has a Judas Priest CD in it.&nbsp;   The fact that a cop caught me banging my head to some Priest and just mostly looked amused.&nbsp;  The fact that I think Rob Halford is the best metal singer ever.&nbsp; And he's incredibly sexy.&nbsp; Yeah, I hear you laughing.&nbsp; Its true though, he's really sexy.&nbsp; So fuck&nbsp;you! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The fact that I received a paycheck.&nbsp; With some overtime on it!&nbsp; (badly needed)  Email correspondence with my sister Sunrise.&nbsp; That really helps&nbsp;break up the day.  I didn't have to buy lunch because Slutetta (who works in my department) asked me if I wanted an egg roll.&nbsp;&nbsp;She's a good girl.... sometimes.&nbsp; heh. (Another story, another day)  Romeo was in a good mood, Molly Shannon wasn't driving me crazy, the boss was looking really good and Sean John got a new $60,000.00/year position at GE.&nbsp; You go, girl!!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I love the park I go to walk at.  The fact that I saw 13 deer while walking at the park.  The fact that I saw probably 1,040 geese, 15 ducks, three swans and one heron while walking.&nbsp;   The fact that the sick goose I have been keeping my eye on for awhile now seems to&nbsp;be getting better.&nbsp; Big improvements over the last two days.&nbsp; He's still being the loner right now.&nbsp; Get well, buddy.  I love when the moon and the sun are in the sky at the same time.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;not sure if&nbsp;that is supposed to bring any kind of blessings or what but I like it.&nbsp; I don't  feel  cursed!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The fact that I know where 3 hawk nests are.....and you don't.  &nbsp;The fact that when I got home I had a totally ripe juicy red  German Johnson &nbsp;tomato (my favorite!) to slice up&nbsp;for my sandwich.&nbsp; I love tomato season!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My kitty cats and my fishies.&nbsp;    That's&nbsp;a lot of stuff to love in one day.&nbsp; I am a lucky girl.&nbsp; Suddenly I don't feel down anymore.&nbsp; There&nbsp;is so much to be thankful for!

      BConklin1@nc.rr.com  Setting:&nbsp; Classroom.&nbsp; Six students await the arrival of their teacher.   Enter:&nbsp; Planet&nbsp;Brenda&nbsp;Leader&nbsp;a.k.a. Brenda  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good morning class!   Class (in unison):&nbsp; Good morning teacher!   Brenda:&nbsp; Okay I will now be taking roll.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please answer "here" when I call your name.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robbie Petrick (Here!)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barbara Stogie(Here!)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rae Castrutter (Here!)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mikey Patersin (Here!)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scotty Patersin (Here!)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marky Mark Hacking (Here!)   Brenda:&nbsp; Very good class.&nbsp; Now open your books to page 666, we have a very important lesson to learn today.   :Sounds of shuffling book pages:&nbsp;    Brenda:&nbsp; We are going to begin by my presenting you with a loose analogy.&nbsp; Imagine yourself in this situation...change any small details you want in your mind to make the situation apply to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen carefully and then I'm going to go around and get an&nbsp;answer from each of you. &nbsp;   Okay, you are married and/or in a serious relationship.&nbsp; Things have gone well for&nbsp;quite awhile but suddenly the situation changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something happens like....oh, lets say you find someone else you want to be with, or your partner becomes really cranky and hard to deal with, or maybe you discover you're bisexual or gay.&nbsp; We could even throw in&nbsp;some serious money problems or an unplanned pregnancy!&nbsp; You're upset.&nbsp; You're confused.&nbsp; You don't know what to do?&nbsp; So....what DO you do?   Mikey Patersin:  - ooh, ooh I know what I would do.&nbsp; I'd throw&nbsp;her ass down the stairs!   Scotty Patersin:&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; Put her somewhere they'll never&nbsp;find her...like the ocean!   Robbie Petrick:&nbsp; Man,&nbsp;are you crazy?&nbsp; The ocean has currents!&nbsp; Put her somewhere&nbsp;quiet and still, like Falls Lake!   Rae Castrutter:&nbsp; Dude, I'd bust a cap in that ass.&nbsp;   Barbara Stogie:&nbsp; Now that's what I'm talking 'bout!&nbsp; I'd do it more than once if I had to!&nbsp;   Brenda:  &nbsp; Oooooookay....um....Marky Mark Hacking, I&nbsp;notice you haven't said anything yet...what is&nbsp;YOUR answer?   Marky Mark:&nbsp; Well I can't tell you what I would do because then I'd have to kill you but after I finish doing it, I would check into a psychiatric ward so I can try to avoid the police.   Brenda:&nbsp;  &nbsp; No, class!&nbsp; Every&nbsp;one of you is wrong!&nbsp; Pardon the pun, but you are dead wrong! &nbsp;You have a false perception of the world and your role in it.&nbsp; Believe it or not, the world does NOT revolve around you!&nbsp; You are not the only ones with thoughts&nbsp;and feelings....and everything is NOT going to go your way at all times in&nbsp;a relationship!&nbsp; To kill your spouse or significant other is not an acceptable&nbsp;way to solve your&nbsp;relationship&nbsp;problems.&nbsp;   Mikey Patersin:&nbsp; Well....what the hell&nbsp;are we SUPPOSED to do then?   Brenda:&nbsp; Its called a Divorce.&nbsp; That's D-I-V-O-R-C-E, like the crappy country song goes.&nbsp; Also known as Breaking Up.&nbsp; You could call it Ending the Relationship.&nbsp; Sure, you might be mad at the person for whatever reason, and that person could cause a lot of problems for you, but you should never, ever consider murder as a solution to a bad relationship!&nbsp; Ever!   Scotty Patersin:&nbsp; That's a bunch of shit!&nbsp; You can't think like that because if you get a divorce, how are you going to get all the&nbsp;insurance money so you can pay off the bills and make some more bills?&nbsp;   Brenda:&nbsp; Good question, Scotty.&nbsp; The answer is this....human life is more important than money.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me repeat this because it will be on the test....HUMAN LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MONEY.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you've been conditioned to believe otherwise but&nbsp;the concept of money being more important is wrong!&nbsp;   Rae:&nbsp; Bullshit!&nbsp; You mean to tell me that a damn girlfriend's life &nbsp;is more important than a&nbsp;BMW with tinted windows, pimped out&nbsp;with DVD player and Playstation, a mansion with a gold potty, and the respect and admiration of everyone you know because you have so much stuff?   Brenda:&nbsp; Rae, that's exactly what I am telling you.&nbsp;   Barbara Stogie:&nbsp; What if you're just plain tired&nbsp;of being married and want some new&nbsp;meat?   Brenda:&nbsp; Well, Barbara, that's not exactly morality at its finest....however it IS a human trait and it does happen.&nbsp; If you want to be free to&nbsp;date others and have indiscriminate sex with whoever happens along....its not a crime.&nbsp; However, it IS a crime to murder your husband&nbsp;just so you'll be free to do these things.&nbsp; The answer is to divorce, to break up.&nbsp;   Marky Mark:  &nbsp; What about child support payments?&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't afford no baby!&nbsp; She shouldn't have gotten herself pregnant!   Brenda:&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Marky, honey, these things happen.&nbsp; Millions of people before you&nbsp;have experienced an unplanned pregnancy....and not only did they make it through but grew to love their children.&nbsp; Once again, the world does not revolve around you.   I suggest all of you adopt a new lifestyle.&nbsp; One where it doesn't&nbsp;matter what you own or&nbsp;how top of the line your stuff is.&nbsp; Go for a lifestyle of "having enough" and "getting by"....learn to deny yourself every little thing that comes along that you really don't need.&nbsp; Its hard to do, but it can be done!&nbsp; Try to save your money and plan for hardship.&nbsp;&nbsp;Strive&nbsp;to make your relationships work and if it cannot be done....move on from that relationship and let the other person continue to breathe oxygen and pump blood!&nbsp; It is&nbsp;NOT THEIR FAULT you are unhappy.&nbsp; You must learn responsibility for your feelings and responsible ways to act upon your feelings.&nbsp; First degree murder is not an option.&nbsp; You WILL get caught.&nbsp; Why, you'll be the first to be suspected!&nbsp;&nbsp;Your partner's family and friends will be devastated forever and you'll never, ever be able to take it all back! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Robbie Petrick:&nbsp; You know...it seems mighty simple when you put it that way.&nbsp; Maybe first degree murder IS wrong!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:Scene fades:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      BConklin1@nc.rr.com  Be informed!&nbsp; Employees of a KFC chicken supplier&nbsp;were caught abusing live chickens.&nbsp; This was on CNN 07/20/04 for&nbsp;all of&nbsp;2 seconds.&nbsp; These people were videotaped stomping live chickens and slamming them against the walls, apparently all "just for fun".&nbsp; Well, that's just sick.&nbsp; Its bad enough that we have to raise chickens to kill and eat but dammit, we can at least treat them respectfully while they are alive.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in all fairness, KFC took immediate action to terminate this particular supplier (according to the report) so&nbsp;you can't really get pissed off with KFC....it just makes me sick to think there are people that would do that.&nbsp; For more on KFC animal welfare policy, go here&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink http://www.kfc.com/about/animalwelfare_guidelines.htm   &nbsp;  On Planet Brenda, abuse of animals, children, the elderly and the resources of&nbsp;the Earth is a crime&nbsp;punishable by....exposure!&nbsp; I might not be able to strangle you like I want to but I can damn sure put you in my blog!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Message to&nbsp;you chicken abusers:&nbsp; you better be glad I don't know you.&nbsp; I would get your names and your pictures and slag your asses all over the internet.&nbsp; Its part of your karma now....you WILL return as an abused chicken in your next life.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I was going to&nbsp;post a cute little chicken picture&nbsp;here on the blog but I have discovered&nbsp;that it is totally beyond my intelligence to accomplish this.&nbsp; Sparkle will have to help me&nbsp;with that I guess.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm just not young enough to understand.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I was going off on the chicken thing at&nbsp;work&nbsp;today and one girl (who looks very much like Molly Shannon from SNL) says, "I bet you hug trees too, don't you?"&nbsp; DAMN STRAIGHT, I hug 'em all the time!&nbsp; I'm very sensitive and&nbsp;if you don't respect my feelings then I will  kick.&nbsp; your.&nbsp; &nbsp;ass !&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Molly Shannon was&nbsp;then informed that even though I am a tree hugger, I shave both my legs and armpits.&nbsp; Always, always be informed.&nbsp; And say a little prayer tonight for the defenseless of the world.&nbsp;

      BConklin1@nc.rr.com  Missed Moments -&nbsp; July 27, 1996 - Old&nbsp;Durham Bulls&nbsp;Park&nbsp;- A benefit show to get Jesse Helms out of office called Vanish.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bands included Superchunk, Polvo, The Archers of Loaf, The Flat Duo Jets, Capsize 7, Eugene Chadbourne, June, Pipe, The William Christ Supercarr, and Zen Frisbee.&nbsp; Ummmm...where was I and how did I miss this?&nbsp; Why do I have to find out about it almost 10 years&nbsp;later....when none&nbsp;of these bands exist anymore?&nbsp; Well, I think Superchunk still exists but,&nbsp;like, nobody really cares anymore.&nbsp; I bet the Ballpark was simply oozing with&nbsp;indie rock angst from all the Duke and Carolina students.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not only that, I bet it rocked.&nbsp; I wasn't there.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Heard While Eavesdropping - At work, I sit next to a real-life Romeo.&nbsp; He's about 28 years old and all the girls LOVE him.&nbsp; He has girls dropping by to talk to him all the time.&nbsp; He has them calling on the cell&nbsp;phone AND the office phone.&nbsp; I've actually heard him talking on the cell phone with one and another girl be calling on the office phone.&nbsp; Chicks just dig him, I guess.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he's really nice, always joking around and he&nbsp;doesn't mind when the "gang" gives him hell about all his women.&nbsp; Romeo takes it all in stride....but I know the REAL Romeo now.  &nbsp;  Its not like&nbsp;I was eavesdropping on purpose.&nbsp; Lord knows, the man&nbsp;is on the phone 7 1/2 hours out of 8 during the day.&nbsp; I've got him tuned out pretty much.&nbsp; But I just happened to&nbsp;hear the word "love" and my love radar blipped into overdrive.  &nbsp;  He was talking to a girl he had broken up with.&nbsp; Or, rather, it&nbsp;sounded like she had broken up with HIM.&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked her "Is this how you really want it?"&nbsp; Things got real quiet while&nbsp;she was speaking.&nbsp; Then he says (brokenly), "All I know is....I love you.&nbsp; And I miss you."  &nbsp;  Well my little heart just melted.&nbsp; I started to grab the phone and tell this girl to come on, give him one more chance, pleeeeeease?&nbsp; Who would have thought ol' Romeo was so...romantic?&nbsp; Not only that but he WORKS, too?&nbsp; He's a keeper, girlfriend.&nbsp; Don't let him get away.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   I'm really angry with myself today.&nbsp;&nbsp;My little CD player I use at work&nbsp;has been messing up....shorting out mostly...and my headphones were getting pretty bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just get all pissy when my electronics aren't working correctly.&nbsp; So this weekend I made a little trip to Radio Shack and got the killer headphones and a new adapter, with little adapter thingie.&nbsp;&nbsp;And....it doesn't work.&nbsp; The adapter, that is.&nbsp; Even worse, I can't find my receipt.&nbsp; How do you lose a receipt in the span of 12 hours???&nbsp; Only me.&nbsp; Well, now I'm even pissier because of this but thankful I had some batteries in the&nbsp;CD player....at least I have some music this&nbsp;fine morning.&nbsp; Which happens to be....  &nbsp;  RUSH "All the World's A Stage" - when I was in high school this was THE BAND....they became even more important to me than Led Zep when I was&nbsp;a senior.&nbsp; My friends and I were obsessed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But anyway, I played this CD on a recent road trip.&nbsp; My daughter&nbsp;"Sparkle" was like "Mom, who's this?" and I told her "Rush, honey".&nbsp; She listened for a little while and I watched as her eyes began to glaze over.&nbsp; "Their songs are so long", she&nbsp;says.&nbsp; I said "well honey that's because they need time to&nbsp;jam out and blow us all away with their musical prowess."&nbsp; My God, if a song lasts longer than 3 minutes these days...its tree-hugging hippie stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you could have seen Sparkle's face when Geddy Lee happily announces "We'd like to do Side One from our latest album....this is 2112!"&nbsp;&nbsp;"A&nbsp;WHOLE SONG IS ONE SIDE OF AN ALBUM?" screams Sparkle.  &nbsp;  Yes Honey, but its soooo cool.&nbsp; See, there's this guy living in the future when the whole planet is under control of the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx and he's out walking one day and he finds this ancient guitar and he learns to play it in like....a minute!&nbsp; And he's so touched by the beauty of the music that he&nbsp;dashes over to the Temple to share the&nbsp;music with&nbsp;the priests, who are like, yeah, whatever....don't upset the status&nbsp;quo....and the guy gets so&nbsp;depressed he commits suicide and suddenly a killer guitar solo rages.&nbsp; By this time, Sparkle's eyes have lost their sparkle&nbsp;and she looks like she's in a semi-coma.&nbsp; I guess the term "concept album" is now synonomous with "old age"?&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, it did sound kind of ridiculous to myself&nbsp;when I was explaining it to her.&nbsp; I&nbsp;figured there was no sense even trying to explain "By-Tor and the Snow Dog"......but it WAS&nbsp;SO COOL back then, trust me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  If Rush comes anywhere around here to play, I am going to make Sparkle go just to watch Neil Peart drum.&nbsp; It'll be good for her.&nbsp; My parents made me go see Hank Snow way back when, so fair is fair.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hank Snow....if the poor man had sung or played any slower, he would have just fell right over on the stage.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   Okay, time to get caught up a bit!  Regarding the computer fix at work - it wasn't a total failure by any means but it was far from perfect. However our part of the project was just fine so my windpipe has not been severed. They need some new computer people or something. Better yet, a new computer system would work.  I would like to thank the people that sent me supportive emails for abusing the abusive grocery store teenager. Your continued support enables me to be a bitch and feel good about it! There's nothing like some positive reinforcement. Skillz gave me a Yak-Back with him saying "YOU GO GIRL" in his best Rupaul imitation. It was totally hilarious and I played it all day long on Monday to anyone that would listen.  I did get one email from someone I'll call Heng, since that's the hexagram he quotes from: "You are familiar with the I Ching because you have quoted [from it] before. You will know then that ..... 'If a man remains at the mercy of moods of hope or fear aroused by the outer world, he loses his inner consistency of character. Such inconsistency invariably leads to distressing experiences .' The superior man should not fall prey to the negativity of emotions."  You know what, Heng? You are absolutely right. The superior man would not have fallen prey. Which is why I am especially thankful that I am a woman and don't have to bother with all those rules. And I realize that whatever I send out will come back to me threefold. I am prepared to meet my fate and will face the future without fear. Some things are worth throwing a hissy fit over.  In fact, some my negativity has already come back on me. Sparkle really wanted to go to see Butch Walker last night because her friends were going to be there so I gave in and took her. We get there and both of us are greeting the people we knew and someone gets me laughing about something and we're just making all kinds of happy noise. So Mr. Opening Act Emo Dude decides he's going to stop playing until we shut up. Oh...my...God...what a complete utter prick. I swear to you this really did happen. I had absolutely no idea I was in a "no laugh" zone! I thought I was in a nightclub for a couple of minutes and forgot myself, damn. Dude, if people are having a good time at your show, this is a GOOD thing. You will get silent, rapt adoration from fans when you are Robert Plant or Jimmy Page. Which you sure as hell aren't. I'm just going to go ahead and out this dude...he deserves it....Val Emmich. I'd never heard of him because I guess he's just so great that I wouldn't be cool enough to know about him. *rolls eyes* But I made damn sure I knew who he was before I left. I got me a new whipping boy now! Heh heh.  Well, we got over all that pretty quickly and let me tell you, Butch Walker was really, really good. He is a very charismatic performer and he gave it all he had. Great voice, good guitar and piano skills. He has a CD coming out on August 24. I'll have to decide whether to get that or the Guided by Voices CD which is out on the same date. If Sparkle has any say in it....I know which one it'll be. But anyway....at the end of the show he jumps into the audience and has everyone sit on the floor around him and its like, singing by the campfire or something. He had definately created a mood among the audience that you could almost touch. Bravo, Mr. Walker.  But Sparkle and I were both hating life, rolling out of bed this morning, moaning and groaning . Because that was the deal...if we went to a show on a week night then we still had to face up to our responsibilities the next day. *yawn* We both had a cup of High Test Premium Unleaded coffee and things got better though.  So there you have it. Next up, Mark Lanegan or bust. After that, ghost stories. Unless something else happens. Which it probably will. ;-) Life is good. Just don't LOL.

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   Planet Brenda has spun upside down on its axis and I haven't had time to get my crap written.  I have so much stuff going on right now.  1.  The new computer update at work went through last night.  This is the project I have worked on for so long.  We find out our fate this morning. 2.  My mailbox is inundated with mails.  I've got some ghost stories to sift through, some really nice emails and the usual commentary, taunts, abuses, and invitations for kinky sex. 3.  My art projects are done and I am decorating for the party today!  $$$$ 4.  I am feeling better!  (Thank God!) 5.  I've got my Mark Lanegan review notes ready to roll, I just got to piece them together.   6.  I got the Lost in Translation CD to listen to and review unless this computer thing didn't go through, in which case I may not have a head to put the headphones on.  7.  I let Sparkle talk me into something yesterday, it was really freaking fun but we're both paying dearly this morning....sooooo sleeeepy. 8.  I have GOT to work out at some point in time.  9.  I really need a day off to catch up....but I can't do that!  Ozzfest is coming.   LATER!

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   I hate myself when I get all bitchy and gripe and complain all the time. One of my goals as I’ve gotten older has been to always try to maintain a positive attitude….well, as positive as a cynical snotty-ass bitch like me can be, anyway. But here on Planet Brenda, things aren’t always as rosy as my little blog border suggests. I am a woman, I am human, I have not reached menopause, therefore I must bitch occasionally and that’s just a biological fact. So I’ll make a deal with you….let me have this one blog of bitching, just let me just get it all out, and I’ll be back to normal tomorrow.  First gripe - my health. Don’t you just love it when people moan about their aches and pains? Well, its MY turn. It was never my plan to blog this shit, but here it goes. Middle of last week - my neck muscles seized up tighter than if I had been in a car accident. I felt like I needed a neck brace or something. The stiffness spread to my shoulder and right arm. WTF? Finally I start to realize I am having itching on my shoulder, just out of my line of vision. So I march to the mirror, pull my hair back, and there it is….a $*%7$ tick imbedded on my shoulder, right over a vein. Oh yeah, he was having a feast. I got him off of me…this was like Wednesday or Thursday, and now I have this nice little rash going on. And muscle aches, and headaches, and general griping bitchiness. All I want to do is just lay in bed and stare at my wall and stew in my bitch juices. This isn’t like me at all. So now I guess I am going to have to go refinance the house so I can pay my doctor visit copay. And I WORK AT THE DAMNED INSURANCE COMPANY! But don't worry, I am going to stop right there, as this could easily deteriorate into something waaaay off the topic. I need to go to the doctor, end of this particular gripe.  Second gripe - I drag myself out to go fill a prescription I have for 800 mg ibuprofen. I call it in first like a good girl. But when I get to the pharmacy….there she is….Geisha Girl. Geisha is ALWAYS working. And Geisha needs a fucking vacation, big time. She is so mean and so rude, and she looks at you like you have inconvenienced the hell out of her by just existing. I’m telling her my name and she’s like “I KNOW who you are!”….well excuse the living hell out of me, I didn’t realize I had gotten famous so suddenly. I’m going to have to ask Ben Affleck to be a little more discreet next time we hit the town together. But I held my peace, I didn’t explode…I think I IMPLODED a little bit but no children or small animals were harmed. I just kind of passively-aggressively glared at her and bit my lip. Yeah, that really showed her!  Third Gripe - Homeless guy staring at me in the car in the middle of the intersection. He didn’t ask for change, he just stared. This is starting to creep me out beyond belief. Why don't they just ask me for change like they do everyone else?  Come on home with me baby, I’ll make you wish you could return to the safety of your bridge.  I’m going to start passively-aggressively barking and snarling at them and acting psychotic to scare them. Better yet, why don't I just stop the damn car, get out and chase them? Barking and snarling, of course.  Fourth Gripe - had to go by the grocery store, which is a gripe unto itself and deserves its own gripe number.  Fifth Gripe - the little old man looking for Ant Killer at the grocery store and obviously he either can’t see well or he can’t read because he's so old…..he’s standing there in the detergent and cleaning stuff aisle asking me to help him find Ant Killer. At the same time I notice these two teenagers that work there keep looking down the aisle and snickering. It didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out what was going on. They had told him the wrong place on purpose, which I confirmed with the man. “Well they told me down this way.” I get the man to the right section and help him pick out some ant stuff, then I head directly for that little prick’s checkout line. Never mind that there’s a lady in front of me with 10,000 items. I’ll wait, thank you. I stare at this kid the whole time and he’s getting nervous. Line 2, no waiting, ma’am. No thanks, I’ll wait. He’s tripping out by this time. He knew what I was brewing over. He checks out my couple of little things and I finally take my eyes off of him while I count out change. I made sure to get it within a few cents. Eyes back on him. He gave me 4 cents of change. I looked at it and told him, “I’d kick your ass for this much”, threw it at him hard, and stalked out. Then I went out to my car and cried my eyes out just like any other badass would do. But just as I thought, Teenage Twerp didn't have the guts to do a damned thing about any of it. Just stood there and gawked, all braces and zits. Oh but he doesn't mind making fun of a man so old he's lucky to even be getting around. *Screams in frustration*  I’m telling you, I’m way out of control. I promise I'm not always like this. But sometimes I am. I'm going back to bed before somebody gets hurt.  Probably me.

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   Planet Brenda would like to extend sympathies to all those who lost loved ones during the hurricane. It just sucks that this kind of stuff happens. Looking at all the pictures makes you realize how powerful Mother Nature really is. I'm very thankful that all we got around here was rain.  I accepted an invitation to my friend Skillz's house in Chatham County today. It was really cool. He has a tiny recording studio in his basement and he played a bunch of stuff he's been working on for me. He freestyled a song about me (complete with beats!) and I loved it. He should have recorded it but I didn't think about it at the time. Now he's IMing me claiming he doesn't remember what all he sang! Skillz is a trip and I'm glad I got to know him.  Sparkle has been about to have a cow tonight. We were talking in the living room and we heard something moving around outside. It was probably just one of the cats, a possum, or a deer but she is convinced someone has escaped from prison and is lurking around the house. I try to convince her not to be afraid. Let's face it....if you've just escaped from prison, are you going to try to break into the little ghetto house or are you going to go for one of those million dollar jobs down the road? That's what I'm talking about. I think I've ruined Sparkle's mind with all those ghost stories I've told her.  We do have a ghost here at the house. It mostly stays in my room. My room is always much noticeably colder that the rest of the house, even in the winter. In winter it gets so cold I can't sleep in there anymore. When it snows and the snow covers the roof, the last place it melts off is over my room. The only time I've ever felt anything other than a moving draft was one night laying in bed. It felt like someone sat on the bed beside where I was laying and brushed the top part of my cheek up to my hair. I was freaking out but I felt cared for, too. I still didn't sleep in there that night, though. Sometimes I just get all weird and can't sleep in there and I keep an alarm clock in the living room in case I feel like I have to move in the night. Several years ago Blab was in the bathroom and heard footsteps going down the hall but no one was there. I've never heard that and I'm glad. But anyway poor Sparkle is convinced the whole house is haunted and she gets all freaky about the dark.  Everyone always asks who do I think the ghost is and I have no idea. My grandparents, both dead, lived here. My parents, both dead, lived here. I have a load of dead friends (and no, I didn't kill them, either!).  My sister has friends that have died.  A lot of people that are dead now have spent time in this house. Maybe its a ghost even older than that. Someone else owned this house briefly before my grandparents bought it. This was one of the first houses in this area so maybe its the ghost of a pissed off naturalist who didn't want the area developed. Also, General Johnston surrendered to General Sherman right down the road at the Bennett Place....I bet anything soldiers passed through here. Maybe one of them really liked it here. Whoever it is I am glad they seem to like me okay. They don't try to scare me and I don't feel scared very often.  Whoever the ghost is, he/she is welcome here but I wish they didn't have to be so cold! I would be interested in any ghost stories you people might have, so send them to me. My email link is at the top of the page. Please let it be  true  stories and indicate if you would care if I publish any of them. As usual, your identity and email address will not be used. But send me a moniker I can use in place of your name.

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   I got the Hurricane Blues. The weather has been absolutely BLAH, right now there is a tornado warning just a few miles away. I'm supposed to work in the morning but if its really raining like hell and the wind blowing and stuff, I'm not going. Supposedly in the morning is when the worst of the storm is going to be passing through this area. I'm tempted to try to go ahead now and get some sleep and get up about 3:00 a.m. I can't sleep when these storms are around...at least I will have had a little bit of rest if I do this. I don't know.  I gave into the temptation and got the Wilco tickets. Yes, I got them! I should be able to see a bit more than the top of Jeff Tweedy's hair, so I'm happy enough. Also, my Ozzfest tickets arrived today. Boy am I ever glad today's not Ozzfest day! Holy crap, talk about getting blown away! ;-)  Today was so stressful at work. My boss, Handsome Robot, has managed to piss off all the women in my department except me. One by one, with robot-like precision, he has gone through each girl and said something to totally annoy every one. Slutetta even cried a little bit. He has insinuated certain ones are not "team players", that certain ones are drowning in negative energy, and removed a few others from projects with the unsaid message that they just weren't cutting the cheese. No wait, cutting the mustard. That's it.  I'm not exactly sure how I've managed to escape his wrath and I'm not positive I HAVE escaped. He came over and said stuff to me several times but I had my headphones on, LOUD, (some Helium and some Corrosion of Conformity, in case you were wondering), and I kind of listened enough to get the gist of what he was asking me and answered accordingly. Maybe he insulted me and I just didn't catch it? He could have called me the office equivalent of Benedict Arnold and it didn't register. Damn thee, Turncoat! I've learned to tune him out and I wish my female co-workers would learn to do the same.  Some people should just shut up and look good,  and he's definately in that category.  Cool Man at Offbeat Music called and my  Lost in Translation  soundtrack has arrived. I'll go get it tomorrow unless it becomes  Lost in Hurricane . 4 new Kevin Shields songs, so I'll let you know the deal on that. Someone on the email tried to destroy my Kevin obsession by letting me know that Kevin is a fat old British bloke now. Shit....you think I care about that? I'd still worship at his feet if he came to my town. And feel very unworthy, at that.  Also I want to give you a guys a full Mark Lanegan  Bubblegum  review as soon as I get it together. I'm working on it and I still have a few more listens to do.  Hope everyone in the hurricane's path will be safe and sound. If I disappear for a few days you'll know we lost power. But I've got plenty of batteries for the CD player, art work to do, lots of reading to catch up on, and a vintage bottle of wine (late 2002!) if I get bored, so I'm happy! Love to you all!

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   Before I get started today, I want to say thank you to the people encouraging me to GO FOR IT regarding the Wilco tickets. I don't know if I will or not but all this encouragement kind of has me pumped up to DO IT.  Nu-Metal Boy is HIGHLY irate over my choice of moniker for him. HA HA....Nu-Metal Boy! Nu-Metal Boy! Nu-Metal boy! I could totally out you, dude....but no, I'm a professional! Your sorry ass identity and email address are eternally safe with me. I just love pissing off people who are already pissed off anyway.  My big news is...I've got not one but TWO  paying  art jobs. That's right...I said "paying" and "art" in the same sentence. The first one is a portrait...which is going to be a breeze because the person wants it done from a photograph. The second is decorating for a party....but the party is an unusual theme and you can't just find this kind of decorations...they'll have to be MADE! So, here I am. I can get into making some extra money doing something I like doing. Life is good.  Now, on to today's main thang: the hurricanes that are headed our way. Bonnie and Clyde. No wait...Bonnie and Charley. Same difference. Wind and lots of rain. We won't be hit too hard here in NC except rain...but in Florida the divorce rate is getting ready to soar. And why is this? Because spouses tend to find out what each other is REALLY about when disaster strikes.  1996, Durham NC, Hurricane Fran. The forecasters were saying... it could happen! Wouldn't hurt to prepare! I began telling my spouse, Brat, that maybe we should think about some batteries and such items. First sign of trouble...his eyes glaze over every time I mention hurricane preparation.  Then the storm hits. I can't sleep. Brat is snoring away. I get up and hang out in the living room until the power goes out. Then I light the candles and start reading a book. Trees start falling. Brat finally wakes up out of his passed-outedness, comes into the living room and announces, "That's TREES falling!". Well that tends to happen during hurricanes. But I didn't get smart or anything, I just agreed that yes indeed, that WAS trees that were falling and who would have ever guessed that such an intense storm was coming our way?  Fran was particularly hellish for us and I'm convinced the hurricane passed directly over the top of the house. It was only by the grace of God that a tree didn't fall and crush the house because they certainly did fall in all the other available space. But afterwards Brat nerves were just in overdrive. We had NO POWER. For a man who spends all his free time in front of the TV, this was a national crisis. Somehow the storm became my fault. If I didn't exist, this storm would not have taken away the television waves. It seemed to really bug him out that I had no TV anxiety whatsoever and was able to keep myself and my daughter occupied by reading, drawing, just whatever.  And Brat was forced to spend time with Sparkle...and it became glaringly obvious that was going to be a disaster. Any noise she made above 20 decibels just killed his already frayed nerves. I will never understand why I thought he would make a good father....but I did think that at one time.  As soon as the power was restored and he was able to nurse a cold Natural Light (those things should come with nipples attached) and retreat into  Cheers  reruns...he returned to being a blip on the radar screen, a heartbeat on the monitor. That was the first time the word DIVORCE popped into my head. We managed to last another year...but Hurricane Fran was the beginning of the end. And a glorious thing it was.  So beware you married people. This storm could be the real test of your relationship. There WILL be divorce due to this. Lawyers all over the southeast are stoked.

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   Okay why is everyone being so nice to me? I got some really nice emails yesterday....people are consoling me about the Wilco thing and agreeing with me on the Johnny Depp thing. I didn't have any contrary or abusive emails except for Nu-Metal Boy, who always sends contrary and abusive emails anyway. *waves to Nu-Metal Boy* I don't actually know Nu-Metal Boy personally but I appreciate that he has made it his mission in life to set me straight on a daily basis.  I've been slowly working in music commentary amongst all the other commentary in these blogs. Let's see, I've discussed MBV, Wilco, Jeff Buckley, Judas Priest. This has a few people distressed....they understand the MBV thing but they can't believe I haven't gotten around to mentioning my favorite band ...FAILURE! Well, one of my favorite bands. My most favoritest.  Besides....wait, one thing at a time.  Failure is a band that ruled the world for one bright, shining CD,  Fantastic Planet . Ohhhh yeah. They had two other releases before that,  Comfort  and  Magnified .  Magnified  is pretty good but its not  Fantastic Planet  by any means. I ordered  Comfort  once used and the  Comfort  case arrives but guess what's actually inside?  Fantastic Planet . I took this as an omen and didn't pursue it further (Although I should, Steve Albini produced  Comfort  and I'd like to hear that for sure).   Fantastic Planet  - where do I even start? Okay, when I first heard it, I didn't think that much about it, it was like....hmmm, "alternative". It was a lot to take in on a first listen though, so I knew I'd be giving it another spin. And that second spin starting reeling me in. Then at some point I started realizing "my God, this is almost close to perfect." And it is. The music, the words, the whole damn thing....its almost too good to exist. The driving force behind Failure was the combination of Ken Andrews and Greg Edwards. These days there are two schools of thought, each saying their man was the MAIN MAN. I'm personally in the Ken Andrews camp. Ken Andrews, aka "Sweetie Pie." When I speak of Sweetie Pie, Sparkle immediately understands I'm not referring to a boyfriend but rather to Ken Andrews. Sweetie Pie sings, plays all the guitar (or most of it...Greg might do some guitar things but not much), he writes, he produces, and I bet he can even move objects with his mind if he tried hard enough.  After  Fantastic Planet,  Failure broke up. I guess it was either break up or die (see Jeff Buckley story in the archives, July 30). They were going to die if they didn't break up because they were definately too good to keep living. Sweetie Pie went on to do two projects, ON (which I looooove both CDs, though the music is a very different style) and Year of the Rabbit (which I don't like nearly as much). Greg Edwards went on to do Autolux, which I think totally sucks and that's why I'm not in the Greg Edwards camp. Kellii Scott went on to be in Blinker the Star but I don't know what he's doing now. And Troy Van Leeuwen....okay, I'm going to hold off on him for a minute.  I tried to figure out why I didn't love Year of the Rabbit as much as Failure. After all, it was Sweetie Pie doing that thing he does but it just felt like something was missing. Most people would say "Greg Edwards, duh!" but I think what's really missing is Kellii Scott's drumming. The guy has a way with a beat and I find his drumming very appealing. Sweetie Pie really should consider reuniting with Kellii Scott. IMHO.  And now...Troy Van Leeuwen. This guy might be one of my favoritest musicians ever. His entire musical history is basically "emergency guitarist for hire". And he does it so well. He steps into Failure for the  Fantastic Planet  tour and did a fine job (I have a bootleg of a Failure show on DVD to prove it) so Sweetie Pie could concentrate on his singing and rhythm. Then later on A Perfect Circle snaps Troy up. And he did well with that. So then Queens of the Stone Age (whom Troy loved) invited him to join and he jumped on it. When I saw QOTSA...that Troy was one busy little musician...playing guitar and synthesizer and I don't know what all he was doing back there. All he needed was a little drum at his feet and he could have been a one-man band. It was quite a sight to see, watching him operate. R-E-S-P-E-C-T, baby. Troy Van Leeuwen is the  Imperial Grand Poobah of Planet Brenda Universe .  Only one problem with Troy....he did his little solo side project, Enemy and....well, I don't like his voice that much. But my God, the man can't be PERFECT can he? But he's close, real real close.

It could happen one day!

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   Okay, I'll let you know right now that I didn't get Wilco pre-sale tickets and I'm totally bummed about it.  I logged on, I had the right password, but this pre-sale site must have had access to about 3 or 4 tickets.  It sold out quickly in a little more than 30 minutes.  Now I'm just like any other run of the mill average-ass Wilco fan, and if I want tickets I'll have to try on Friday morning.  Well, I don't even know if that's going to happen.  Why should I spend money to look at Jeff Tweedy's hair when I can just go buy a Wilco poster, sit home, put their CDs on, and pretend I'm there.  Sheesh.   Okay, on to what the blog was originally going to be about today..... Mystic River.         I caught a bit of hell in the email over my preference of Johnny Depp's performance in  Pirates of the Carribean  to the whole  Mystic River  thing. Well excuuuuuse me~please, let me explain myself.  I love Tim Robbins, he's one of the very best of the best actors out there. And I bet you can get yourself within 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon if you tried hard enough. But Sean Penn...he's just not one of my favorites. Yes, he has acting chops and yes, he's talented. But he just doesn't appeal to me for some reason. Its not his looks at all...I guess its his attitude. I don't know, I just sense this.... something  coming off of him. Attitude, baby. I bet he can be a total asshole sometimes. I bet he and Madonna would try to out-bitch each other whenever it was just them alone. I bet that was one hell of a marriage.  But I'm getting way away from the subject. Mystic River. Sean Penn's character is almost a typecast for him as far as I'm concerned. Small time mafia badass. Attitude. Accent. Puh-leeze....the guy was just playing his real self! (Kind of like Courtney Love, but that's a whole other can o' worms blog you'll read one day).  Okay, so its the three kids...one is kidnapped and horribly abused(Tim Robbins' character). He grows up kind of weird but he's coping with life. Then Sean Penn's daughter gets killed and it seems like ol' Tim might be responsible. To break it straight down....Sean kills Tim and then it turns out that Tim really didnt kill Sean's daughter. But hey, its okay, because Sean knows local cop Bacon and Kevin Bacon isn't going to narc his friend out. End of movie.  Come on people! Yeah, it was an interesting story and the acting was good but that ending was lame-o. I was ready for the movie to end.   Pirates of the Carribean , on the other hand ... do   I really feel like going here?......come on. It was really good and sooo entertaining and.......Johnny Depp.......and....what else do I need to say? There's going to be a  Pirates of the Carribean II  but I have haven't heard of contract negotiations for  Mystic River II . That's because no one cares about Sean Penn and his mafia badass in-cold-blood killer self. But we all just loooooooove us some Johnny Depp acting like Keith Richards! I repeat myself, Johnny wuz robbed of the Oscar. IMHO.  The Defense Rests.

        Wilco pre-sale tickets on sale today, baby! Pre-sale to those registered to the website. That would include me. *does a little dance*  I was raising all kinds of hell in the middle of the waterfalls at Eno River on my Sunday hike with Blab. It was so beautiful outside and I was feeling great. Blab, of course, wouldn't shut the hell up as usual so I started navigating the rocks to the big waterfall. Got there, loved it, moved on....eventually I lost my footing and got my boots wet. After that it was anything goes. I was all in the waterfall, whooping and hollering and scaring the little fishies. Of course there was the miserably wet hike back but it was one of those days you look back on when you're 85 and realize you really LIVED.   I saw at least 10 turtles all hanging around in a slow, sunny pool. Big ones. They are so awesome.   Spotted while walking at the park - two elderly people, at least 85 years of age, walking together and holding hands. It was so sweet and I got all teary. Forget looking back on life at 85....keep on living it!!!!!!!  Also at the park....some dude and his dog. They were at the pond. The dude would set off some kind of something that sounded like a firecracker or a small pistol. Then he would throw something into the water. The dog would go in after it. The dude would cheer the dog on and then when the dog reached the thingie, the dude would  blow a whistle  to   signal the dog to swim back. WTF? It sounded like football practice. "TWEET, TWEEEEEET." Is this dog going to be in the National Retrieving Shit Out of The Pond championships or something? I could take a dog like that home and spoil him the rest of his life...he'd never have to get one damn thing out of the pond ever again, unless he just wanted to.   Also on sale today.....Mark Lanegan's latest solo album...Bubblegum. I plan to visit "Offbeat CDs" as soon as I get off work. Holy crap, today is LEGENDARY in music history....Mark Lanegan, Wilco tickets....*sighs happily*  First day of school today and Sparkly-Poo is now in high school! Unbelievable. I really would like to have some more kids but I just don't want to HAVE them. They would already have to be born. Also it would help if they came with some kind of trust fund so I could support them. I don't think they make kids like that though. You have to marry into that sort of situation.   Of course, I won't be getting married because all the men my age are on crack or alcohol, or they are just plain weird. All the best ones are taken, so I am just going to have to wait and swoop down on some girl's excellent cast off when she's going through her mid-life crisis and is trying to "find herself". I know you're out there, my love. I just got to find you.   I'm back on my diet. It was a week of pure bliss....lasagna, japanese food with fried rice, pepsi galore, a 3 egg omelet with cheese, cheese, lots and lots of cheese! I ate that omelet with finesse. But now its over, back to the healthy stuff for awhile.   Today was good. As I was screaming under the waterfall on Sunday:  "THIS IS SO AWESOME!"

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   Hi! No update yesterday....I was too busy livin' it to write about it.  I have discovered that spotting the male mexican species sporting a raging hard-on is an omen that soon you will be taking your teenage daughter to the mall and spending massive amounts of money on school clothes. Its true, its true. 2 pairs of jeans and a pair of sweat pants - $88.00. It flips me out how much stuff costs these days! But Sparkle had outgrown her jeans except one pair so she had to have them. So now she has 3 pairs of jeans and I will be able to get her more later because I am working that overtime. And she has Bam Margera shoes so she feels like her coolness factor is intact. Sheesh, a Led Zeppelin T-shirt used to do that for me.  And this was the tax-free weekend....which is actually a bunch of bull schivosky. I figured up if you spend $60.00 you end up saving like $4.00 and some change. I'm not complaining but I don't get into a frenzy if I don't get all the shopping done on the tax-free weekend. I wish they would have a 50% off weekend. Now I could really get into that!  I found a new CD store here in Durham that appeals to me. FYE does NOT appeal to me! This little place is at Brightleaf Square and is called Offbeat CDs. Its basically all the stuff I love and then some. They had this Johnny Depp DVD called "Dead Man" that I had been looking for years to find! And its Johnny Depp, so you know I was all over that anyway. This store is cool enough that they were going to be getting in the new Mark Lanegan CD ANYWAY on Tuesday, I didn't have to, like, special order it. And the guy actually knew who Mark Lanegan was, which means this store was batting 1,000 in my book. They had a Led Zeppelin T-shirt that I'm going back to get later, so I can regain my former coolness.  We came home immediately and Sparkle, Bitchard (her boyfriend) and I watched "Dead Man." Wooooo, it was a typical Johnny Depp artsy-fartsy eclectic flick....very strange yet totally appealing. Johnny plays a little tenderfoot city slicker from the East who heads out to the Wild West during...well, the Wild West days. Its a total disaster trip and one thing leads to another and the next thing you know, Johnny and his cool Indian pal are on the run. I totally loved that movie. That was one of the flicks Johnny was honing his acting chops on so he could wow the masses with "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Secret Window". I just loooooooove me some Johnny Depp, good lord what a man! Not only does he have tremendous talent, I just admire the way he seems to carry himself in public as being humble about how truly great he really is. That's always the sign of a superior man on Planet Brenda, baby. And then to top it all off, he's TOTALLY  HOT . He's so hot that even the straight men know he's hot. And that's when you're really hot.  I was disappointed that Hollywood didn't give the Deppster the Oscar this year. I'm sorry but I am one of the ones that just didn't like Mystic River all that much. I'm sure Johnny could care less if he wins an Oscar but I want him to get one within the next 5 years. He was robbed this year. IMHO.  So anyway, if you love Johnny Depp ( I know you do) and you can stand a little strange film-making with a weird ending, then Dead Man is for you. If you can find it. Good luck. (Bet you'd have to get it off the internet).  Planet Brenda expresses condolences to the family and friends of Rick James...Super Freak and Partier Extraordinaire. You'll be able to take those kinky girls home to mother in heaven, Rick. RIP.

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   I was at a used bookstore and picked up a little paperback book called "A Dictionary of Omens and Superstitions" by Philippa Waring. It was written in the 1970's so I would imagine its probably out of print by now. It looked like something interesting to thumb through so I picked it up. $3.50!~ And let me tell you, that little book has been worth every penny. I have had the most fun with that book. I take it with me most everywhere and when I see something that strikes my fancy, I look it up and see what kind of omen it represents.  Like this evening I had to go out and run a few errands. As I am on my way to CVS I happen to notice a large bird swooping down. I got just enough glimpse of it to realize it was some kind of owl! Totally cool. So when I get to CVS the first thing I do is get my omen book out and see what an owl represents. Well, lo and behold, to see an owl by daylight is an omen of misfortune. Great. Its a good thing I had the Judas Priest (still stuck on that one) on full volume though, because to hear one hoot is an omen of death. But I'm really relieved I don't know where the thing lives, because anyone who looks into an owl's nest with become unhappy for the rest of his life! I always kind of liked owls but forget it....they are more trouble than they're worth.  After I finished my errands I decided to stop by the Japan Express and pick up an entree for me and Sparkle. I walked in, placed my order and went to a small table to await the order. I brought my book with me so I wouldn't be bored. I read for a little while...then I realized the place was getting more and more crowded and I still hadn't gotten my order yet. I noticed one of the waiters on the phone taking an order than came to like $65.00, so I guess they were pretty busy. All of a sudden I noticed this mexican guy standing there, staring at the menu board and he had a huge erection going on. I guess this guy really  really  likes spring rolls or something. I don't usually hang around looking at guys' crotches but you just couldn't miss this unless you forgot to put your contacts in or something.  I fought with my impulse to LOL for a minute, then I realized I had my omen book with me! I quickly thumbed through it searching for "Raging Hard-On" but nothing was listed. There was nothing listed under "Penis" either. But then I did find an entry under "Sex".....and the only thing that really applied was the superstition that men from hot climate countries have large penises because of the generative power of the sun. I also found an entry under "Wood" that claims it is good fortune when a man with a wooden leg comes towards you....they didn't specify which leg so I'm assuming this would apply.  I'll keep you updated on my luck for the next 24 hours and we'll see if we can figure out what this might imply.

Here's a link:   urlLink http://www.anomalies-unlimited.com/   Especially check out the "Ghosts" link....some really cool photos there. My favorites are the Cocklawburn Beach Phantom Family and The Glaring Firestarter of Wem Hall. Also check out the "World Trade Center UFO's" link....now that is some weird stuff. Its probably just someone tampering with film but it makes you think of all kinds of possibilities.  The temperature has gotten a lot more bearable around here and I may actually have to break down and mow some grass tomorrow. The neighbors are having conniption fits, I am sure.  Quickie mail update:  I had few belated stragglers come to Billy Corgan's defense. Yawn.  I got several nice emails from people sympathizing about my close encounter with the business end of a gun. Thanks. I also got one from someone wishing I'd bit the dust the other morning. That was nice, fuck you very much.

      From the I Ching:  "When, at the beginning of summer, thunder - electrical energy - comes rushing forth from the Earth again, and the first thunderstorm refreshes nature, a prolonged state of tension is resolved. Joy and relief make themselves felt. So too, music has power to ease tension within the heart and to loosen the grip of obscure emotions. The enthusiasm of the heart expresses itself involuntarily in a burst of song, in dance and rhythmic movement of the body. From immemorial times the inspiring effect of the invisible sound that moves all hearts, and draws them together, has mystified mankind."  I just think that is beautiful! Those ancient Chinese really knew what they were talking about, didn't they? Its also pretty fun to imagine a bunch of ancient Chinese people dancing and jamming out while some guy plucks an instrument with one string. I want to rock and roll all night and party every day, ah su?  Whenever I read historical-type stuff and try to imagine how long ago this or that happened, I find that I get all bogged down. I don't have a very clear time-line in my head of history. Its like, cavemen, Bible dudes, castle dudes, Victorian times and now. That's just a little too vague. It doesn't help either when you have all these newspaper articles, at least once a week, that claim someone has found the  OLDEST BONES EVER  or   there was evidence of life when the Earth was still a simmering pot of stew. I wish someone would draw a timeline for me so I could get an idea of the time span involved in everything.  My yard looks like a jungle right now and its just too freaking hot to do anything about it. I know my neighbors are hating me but I'm not getting out there and push mowing until it cools a little bit. There's nothing worse than mowing and feeling the waist band of your underwear getting wet from sweating.  I've been so busy at work I haven't even had time to listen to music the past few days. We are so swamped at work and suddenly everything is a priority, and I'm really not getting anything done. Can you say overtime? I'm really going to be working a lot here for awhile but I need the money anyway. Sparkle is starting high school this year and I can see already its going to be one money deal after another. School hasn't even started yet and I've already received a thing to order a yearbook for $40. And if I don't order it by like August 31, it goes up to $50. $50! For a freakin' yearbook???? I feel old, very very old. And its just getting started.

      Today was totally great. You just wouldn't believe it.  It was a dark and stormy morning. It was 5:45 a.m., dark and dreary as can be. I'm coming down Hillsborough Road when I notice a homey riding his bike in the middle of the road, no reflectors or anything. He was hard to see but I DID see him and was taking the appropriate slowing down precautions. Well apparently I wasn't precautioning hard enough to his liking, because he turns around at the stop light and points a gun at me. With one arm extended, like he's Antonio Banderas in "Once Upon a Time in Mexico". Daaaaaaaaammmn! My heart jumped into my throat and I threw my hands up and was like "WTF?????"  When he saw me freaking he lowered the gun but he was steadily talking junk the whole time. He was really pissed and I don't know why. But anyway I just cut on through and got on the highway. I wasn't about to take a chance stopping to call the police, who would have taken probably 15 minutes or more to get there. Well I was freaking for about the first hour after all that but everything is good. I didn't get a cap busted in my ass, that's all that matters.  And I actually had a pretty good day at work. I've really caught on to my job now and feeling confident. Tomorrow I am actually going to be training a new employee so somebody thinks I know SOMETHING.  Today my friend at work named "Boo Boo" brought me lunch...she had cooked up some halibut fresh from Alaska...her father-in-law caught them on his trip there. Well I was into that. She made it with some kind of recipe that really kicked ass. She is going to bring me the recipe and I will post it in the blogger....it was THAT good.  I said I would post about going to the park and that I was going no matter if it was raining or not. Well, that statement got retracted when it was raining like a MONSOON due to the hurricane off the coast. I was pouting and hating life, but today was much better. I was able to go to the park and I saw my sick goose buddy. He's still hanging out all by himself but he seems fine. He was swimming. He has to be eating or I don't think he would have made it this long.  So basically I am just glad to be alive and waiting for the day when I can get out of this gangland. I don't know exactly where I want to go but I am going somewhere one day. Probably when I retire. And I'm going to get me a dog too when I retire, I want a collie.

       urlLink BConklin1@nc.rr.com   Can I get an halleluiah? Finally!  Its been 14 days since Lori Hacking went missing. How has this guy been able to hold up under intense questioning for 14 days??? He must be one heck of a skilled liar. I would have broken down and confessed once the first "bad cop" started getting an attitude. But of course I never would have killed anyone to begin with. So now we just wait and see what happens. I got a feeling there is more to this story than we ever dreamed. At least now her parents know what the deal is and they can start trying to get on with their lives. I think that waiting and wondering would do me in.  Well we are dealing with Tropical Storm Alex here in good ol' NC. It seems like it has been cloudy for days and days. And the humidity is the worst. The storm itself is not supposed to come here, only brush the coastline. But I think its going to be cloudy and rainy the rest of my natural life. I will be glad when it moves on.  This is all I am going to write for today. I am so tired and I've been feeling stressed. I am going walking at the park after work whether it rains or not. I'm tired of no exercise and its starting to tell on me. I get more tired if I don't exercise, if that makes any sense. I'll let you know what's up at the park in tomorrow's update.  Later!

      Sorry for no update yesterday, but I was really frustrated with the computer. I want to kill it, actually. Sparkle is supposed to have it fixed by Monday, August 2, 2004 at 4:00 p.m. e.s.t.  I thought I would really be provoking you people with the Billy Corgan comment but as it turns out, nobody cares about Billy Corgan anymore. I like the direction this trend is heading in. You're done, Billy. Put a fork in it.  Awhile back Billy went off in the press about how James Iha was the reason for the Smashing Pumpkins breaking up. Ummmm....why didn't he just kick Iha out then and get another guitarist and keep his Smashing Pumpkins? You wait, that dude will form another band and call it Smashing Pumpkins before all is said and done. You heard it here first. The cool thing was that Iha never responded in the press, which was very  I Ching  of him .  The superior man rises above the conflict, etc. etc.  I'm very tired of dealing with teenagers right now...especially concerning the telephone. They call all the time for Sparkle...and I do mean ALL THE TIME. And multiple times. If a kid decides they want to talk to Sparkle, they don't just call and leave a message. They call 50 times after the message and keep hanging up. I refuse to answer the phone, I am not a secretary. I, of course, never got any phone calls when I was a teenager....right.  However, I guess I am still being a teenager because I am preparing to go to Ozzfest in a few weeks. I just gotta go....Judas Priest is reuniting!!!!! I won't mention anything about Rob Halford in this post because I'm not going there again. :-P And of course Slayer is going to be there and Black Sabbath, who I've never seen before. Yup, this Ozzfest is a must-see! I announced to Sparkle this was going to be my last concert because I am finally going to grow up but then I found out less than 24 hours later that Wilco is coming...so maybe this is my last concert before the last concert? I just looooove some Wilco...even when they get all weird...maybe they will be my next musician commentary.  And finally....I am faithfully waiting for the word on what happened to Lori Hacking. I mean, come on, its obvious the husband (Marky Mark!) has offed her but this press release from the parents saying the search can end due to info Marky Mark has told them....you gotta tell us more than this!  Why do they want the search ended?  Did he totally annihilate her or something? I know to them it may just seem like inquiring minds want to know....but some of us have really prayed hard for a resolution to all this so go on and let us know the deal. Will they ever find her?
