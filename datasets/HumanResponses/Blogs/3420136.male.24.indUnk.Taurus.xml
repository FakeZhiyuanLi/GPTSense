      Well I have had a varied couple of days recently.  On Sunday, I went to Kobe with Reiko`s  family and ate some strange dishes I had takoyaki which you make yourself.  This is basically Octopus pancake balls.  It is quite tricky to make as you only get a small coctail stick to swivel them around in their little hollows but was delicious.  I have had these many times before as they are an Osakan delicacy but I have never made them myself.  We did some shopping around and then in the afternoon, we had Kobe beef.  When the cows are alive, they are given beer to drink so it makes their meat more tender (I wonder how tender my meat is) ooh err.  The chef cooks it right in front of you with what loｏｋ like two wall paper removers but it was ｓｏ ｇｏｏｄ - definitely the best beef I have ever had in my life.  That night I didn`t sleep until six I just couludn`t sleep.  I ended up finishing the Harry Potter book by reading about 550 pages.  I finally got to sleep at 6 in the morning after listening to dogs and cats on heat, paper delivery people on motorbikes - Motorbikes in the morning I ask you - and the dawn chorus.  I learnt some more japanese words though.  I took it upon myself to try and train their unruly dog with a ball and I learnt osuwari which means sit down you bloody bastard of a dog or I`ll........  On Tuesday I tried looking for a job with Reiko at a job centre.  I was told it would be better if I went to the city centre one as they would have more jobs for foreigners there as well as people who could speak English.  It`s both good and annoying that Reiko has to pretty much communicate for me all the time.  It makes my life easier but I do feel very powerless some times.  The Japanese often start talking to me and asking me questions and I just ususally smile and point at her to do all the talking. We are going to the job centre tomorrow which is is a shame as I am on a working holiday visa and so the holiday part of this may be about to come to an end.    After the job centre, we went to the batting centre where you pay 200 yen which is a quid for 28 balls which get thrown at you by the mechanism and you try to hit the damn thing.  Being brought up on football and cricket, baseball is quite a tricky thing to adapt to.  I went on the slowest one and achieved I wopuld say a hit rate of about 30 per cent　a decent hit rate (where the ball actually goes high and far) of about 15 per cent.   i　am knackered more later aha

      Well the interview didn`t go so well. It was only a pre interview one and I had an exit questionnaire in order for my next and final interviwe. It was with this  goatee wearing slightly camp and irritated by every word I seemed to speak man. There was another candidate there as well - a nice 30 odd year old bloke from canada but he has been teaching in Japan for ten years and so was immensely qualified. What got me was well actually many things.  1 - I sent Mr interviewer a c.v but he couldn`t find it. This pretty much marked the beginning of the end. He made a big deal about this saying I need your resume. well mr richard you dick it`s not a resume but a fucking c.v. a curriculum vitae you american twat and you already have it. Don`t blame me for your own error.   2 - The bloke from canada was a git. He was a really nice bloke but he asked all the right questions at the right times leaving me with nothing to say. I am sure if the Canadian bloke had enquired after the possiblities of a blow job, Mr interviewer would have been frothing at the mouth with Yes masters and and a lecherous leer. I asked one question which got me some brownies locked up in a wardrobe - can I teach French and German. Oh you speak French and German do you? Yes I do you Canadian git and American wanker by the way so fuck you. ahem.  3 - I have seen a notice in the local Kansai Time Out, which is a magazine in English for Osaka and he is in there asking for prospective new candidates for the job. This is not so bad, I first heard of the job on the Internet in April. What irritates me is that there is no opening and training start until August at earliest and more likely September as they pay so bloody well. Now it is probably good business sense to do this but I am annoyed so bear with me on this one.  4 - I wore a suit. I`m sorry that`s it.  Yes so that`s it. After I was a bit depressed so I met up with Reiko and got a pint of guinness in a English bar The pig and whistle, which cost me 4 quid. That didn`t help either.  I fell asleep at 9 that day. I am still suffering from jet lag. I woke up at four this morning and had to have an afternoon kip for three hours. I am feeling much better now. I have been reading Doraemon which is a Japanese comic about (bear with me on this one) a robotic cat called Doraemon sent from the 22nd Century in a time machine in order to help a young Japanese boy called Nobita with gadgets he can pull out of his fourth dimensional pocket in his stomach. It sounds weird and well it is but it helps cheer me up. I am also reading the new Hary Potter book and I like that too.  I have just been to a karaoke restaurant. This is a new concept for me where you go into a small room for four people and sing your heart out and eat at the same time. This seemed quite bizarre to me but it was a lot of fun. My over the top rendition of My Way and Jailhouse Rock went down well and I managed to slip in a few Beatles` songs as well. They also have songs in Chinese and Japanese aha.   It is 22:15 local time here now and Tomb Raider is on in Japanese. Aha Goodbye

      alrighty then it`s seven in the morning here I have an interview for a job this afternoon at four. I am still suffering from jet lag (i had three hours sleep last night and 12 hours today(i got up at 3 in the afternoon yesterday and four this morning) I don`t think I`lll get tho. It`s the best place for teaching you only do about 27 hours a week and get paid shit loads. I think they`ll need someone more experienced or something.  Naked old japanese men Naked old japanese men I went to an onsen again last night and saw more naked old japanese men. i went with Reiko`s parents so getting naked with my girlfriend`s father naked again. These things are really amazing. They`ve got baths where you have jets of water pummel your back and bubble baths - it`s great and saunas and outside baths. You get really hot though but they are natural hot water springs and have lots of minerals in.   As I woke up so late, I didn`t do much else. I took their crazy beagle Komaru or more accurately it took me/dragged me along for a walk. It is a really crazy dog as they take it for a short walk early in the morning and then tie it up all day so it seeks attention. I tried to run with it to get it to use up it`s energy whilst it tried to attack the neighbourhood dogs. It was fun.  Reiko saw her friend maki who has two kids called lion and tiger(japanese names are cool) and a husband. He husband goes surfing and plays football in a local five a side team and has lost their last eight games in a row. I`m thinking if they are that shit, I can join them and be their star international on loan striker ahahahahaha the possibilities.........

      On Wednesday I woke up at twelve.  We went into the city centre and tried to open an account with a bank UFJ but I need a stamp thing.  It`s like a slim cylinder the shape of a pencil which has your name in chinese characters on the bottom and you ink it and stamp on official forms as a further id thing.  It seems a bit pointless to me that you can`t open an account unless you have one but we`re in japan and they are differently aligned.  So Reiko opened one using her stamp and then we went to a cheap noodle restaurant (Reiko`s family love food) and then we went to get Reiko a mobile at the vodafone shop.  They said I could get one too as they are all free as contract mainly in Japan.  So we both got the coolest one there which is a Toshiba V401T which you can watch Japanese TV,listen to the radio, it has a video camera of up to 12 minutes 20 seconds and a normal camera as well as being able to access the internet and send emails.  Have a look here http://www.mobilemag.com/content/100/340/C2707/ I love this phone.   In the evening we went to a Yakitori bar.  It is a traditional Japanese bar except you have to order food as well.  They don`t just drink there.  The last time we went there the bloke (dressed in traditional Japanese robes and bandana) behind the bar who owns it with his wife who waitresses, would shout out what he was giving you with such ceremony and a bow (SKEWERED CHICKEN IF YOU PLEASE) which was so funny but he didn`t do it this time as his wife (Damn her) gave us our food.    Then it was back to home for more oolon hai and bed aha

      Alrighty then lets give this a go.  My name is Simon, I am 24 and I have just started to live in Japan with my girlfriend Reiko.  I can speak French and German and I`m hoping to learn some Japanese here and teach some English in order to pay for it.    So, Monday 21st June I left my landlord`s house to get a coach to Heathrow to get a plane to Frankfurt to change there to Osaka Japan.  A total of too bloody long travelling.  We landed at 8 local time which is 8 hours ahead of GMT absoluteley knackered.  Unfortunately as it was eight in the morning Tuesday it was just the start of the day and due to events planned by Reiko`s parents, I wouldn`t be able to get to sleep until 2 at night local time.   It was 23 degrees at eight in the morning and only got hotter during the day.  I`ve been bitten by loads of mosquitos as well.  At night it sounds like I have tinnitus as the insects grasshoppers and mosquitos make their noise sssssssssssssssss like tv static all night.  The first thing we did after getting back to the house was to go to an `onsen` which is a public bath where it`s split into male and female areas and everyone gets naked and goes into different sorts of baths,showers and saunas.  I`m English so this is quite tricky and besides the multitudes of naked old Japanese men and the fact that I`m the only western bloke in there made it even more unnerving.  Reiko`s family love these though and they are really relaxing.  Oh naked old men.  We had a meal at a Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant that evening which was lovely.  Then we went home and drunk some oolon-hai (i think it`s spelled like that) which is Japanese spirit with tea drunk with ice.  I was a bit drunk.

      Reiko had her job interview today.&nbsp; It went okay she said.&nbsp; She was quite modest about it saying how she doesn`t reckon she has got the job (six people in last interview etc.) but from what she says she has done very well.&nbsp; I don`t really want her to get a job but to help me along in Japan instead.&nbsp; If she gets a job I will be permanently lost.&nbsp;   I went with her to her interview today and waited for her in the general local area whilst she had it looking like an American backpacker.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it was very hot. I was walking about&nbsp;wearing a short sleeved shirt with a T-shirt in 35 degree heat.&nbsp; I could not keep this up for long.&nbsp; An hour of constant walking later,&nbsp; Reiko called me on my phone - where are you?&nbsp; This is a very good question indeed.&nbsp; Well Reiko there is a grey building which says something in Japanese writing in front of me.&nbsp; To my right is another building which I am cunningly unable to understand once more and to my left is yet another nondescript building with Japanese qualifications on its exterior which I can neither understand nor describe.&nbsp; Where am I?&nbsp; You Reiko have a clearer idea than I do.&nbsp; After 15 minutes of random wandering and telephone calls I hear a "Oh I can see you now" which sounds like a chorus of heavenly angels&nbsp; to my weary legs and sunburnt ears.&nbsp;   We then went on a de-stressing mission for Reiko which invloved going to lots of women`s clothes shops and looking at clothes and Yukata (traditional Japanese robes) whilst she tried some on.&nbsp; This went on for several hours but I was more than willing to put up with this after her ordeal today.&nbsp; Considering my most trying task was trying to relocate Reiko, she was much more the deserving case and deserved to do what she wanted.&nbsp; We then went to Karaoke where I sang&nbsp;a&nbsp;Beatles medley which went on for fifteen minutes, then 99 Luftballons and Son of a Preacher Man interspersed by Reiko`s offerings.&nbsp; For an hour this came to five pounds or 1000 yen for the both of us including my three straight double whiskys and her alcoholic tea drinks.&nbsp; I prefer going to Karaoke than bars as you can get pissed cheaper and sing at the same time.&nbsp; On average a drink in a a bar costs 500 yen or two pounds fifty.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can get an hour`s karaoke&nbsp;including drink for that, it doesn`t seem worth it.&nbsp;  Tomorrow I am going surfing with Tommy although Reiko doesn`t want to go as she hates the beach and always gets left with the kids.&nbsp; Tomorrow a typhoon is also scheduled to hit Osaka (my first one) which could mean an interesting surfing experience (surfs up dude!) or the end of my blog and life.&nbsp; Bring on the danger!!!

      Yes well again I haven`t really done much different or of note.&nbsp; I saw Shrek 2 finally in the cinema which was okay I guess.&nbsp; I also ate some sushi today.&nbsp; It used to be that I would eat it and it would be one of those foods that you can eat without particularly enjoying much.&nbsp; Now I love the stuff. &nbsp;Eel,salmon, squid, prawn sushi etc.&nbsp; I love them all.&nbsp; I also like seaweed a lot now too.&nbsp; You get it here in thin strips dry it has this weird peppery taste which comes whilst you eat it. Some sushi is fish with rice wrapped in seaweed you know.&nbsp; There`s the link.  I have now read almost all of the fity six short stories and four novels of&nbsp;Sherlock Holmes in about three weeks. In these books, women are portrayed as the main reason behind all forms of crime.&nbsp; I got interested in them thanks to the excellent book The mysterious incident of the dog in the night-time where the boy narrator talks about The Hound of the Baskervilles.&nbsp; The mysterious incident of the dog in the night-time is in fact a quote itself from a Sherlock Holmes mystery.&nbsp; There`s the link.  The job hunting still hasn`t restarted since the rebuff from the interview.&nbsp; (I don`t take criticism well okay?&nbsp; Boo hoo sob sob) I have been checking English language Japan magazines for adverts.&nbsp; On Sunday there is the (allegedly) largest firework show in the world which is right near to Reiko`s house.&nbsp; Reiko has her third job interview tomorrow.&nbsp; I hope she gets it.&nbsp; On Monday we waited for her during her interview in Starbucks right in Osaka centre.&nbsp; In one of the English language Japan magazines, there was a copy of a Japanese article which basically amounted to a stalkers guide for Japanese women of how to meet foreign boys and where they hang out.&nbsp; In this Starbucks there were populous amounts of Americans.&nbsp; Starbucks was mentioned in the article.&nbsp; There`s the link!  Right sorry for this awful stream of consciousness blog.&nbsp; You have to live through the lows of my reports as well as the highs you know.&nbsp; I don`t take criticism well okay (Boo hoo sob sob) There`s the (okay I`ll stop that now)

      So nothing really has happpened that was different than before.&nbsp; Reiko did really well in her job interview.&nbsp; So well that&nbsp;whilst she was on the train to meet us in the city centre they called her back for a second interview straight away and now she has a third interview on Thursday.&nbsp; This puts my interview with Berlitz in perspective since&nbsp;I haven`t had any news since June.&nbsp; Good luck Reiko again!   And that`s about it.&nbsp; I bought&nbsp;a Sherlock Holmes collection from a bookshop with English books in, watched some more Michael Moore and visited some more Onsen.   So I thought I would teach you some Japanese.&nbsp; These words are how they sound and not how they are spelled but anyway.   Hai&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes  iyeah [sounds like yeah]&nbsp; No  Arigato&nbsp; Thanks  Doe Itashimashitay You are welcome  Sumimasen&nbsp; Sorry  Gomenisai Excuse me   Ohio gozaieemass Good morning  Kon ban wah Good evening  Oi sumi Good night   Atsui&nbsp; It`s hot  Sumitai It`s cold  desu ne[sounds like nay] &nbsp;Isn`t it  Chotto Matte&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait a minute   Tadakimasu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gratefully receive this meal Oishee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delicious Gochi so sama deshita&nbsp; That was truly a gourmet meal Biru nomimasen ka?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Won`t&nbsp;you drink some beer  tabimasen ka?&nbsp; Won`t you eat?   Simon wa doko desu ka?&nbsp; Where is Simon?   This is pretty much my entire Japanese vocabulary which I have survived on for 4 weeks.&nbsp; Ahahahahahaha!

      So yesterday and today is festival time in Osaka.&nbsp; Yesterday was the pre-carnival carnival and today is the carnival.&nbsp; We went to the pre-carnival one last night which&nbsp;was a lot of fun.&nbsp; It took us a long time to find it as it wasn`t in the city centre.&nbsp; We eventually found it after taking directions from a elderly&nbsp;three foot midget from Osaka&nbsp;who even Reiko towered over.&nbsp;&nbsp;   It was very colourful and very similar to the Chinese new year version with dragons and the like parading around whilst young maidens with colourful parasols dressed in ancient kimonos dance along in formation to drums&nbsp;and&nbsp;cries of SOLAY.&nbsp; These people do this for three hours in thirty three degree heat, which is very impressive.&nbsp;&nbsp; After we had had as much SOLAY as we could take, we went to karaoke for half an hour which cost four quid each for half an hour but with as much free drink as you could take.&nbsp; Ahahahaha!  Today I went to the beach with Tommy and the family whilst Reiko took her TOEIC exam.&nbsp; It is an exam for English which you need to have if you want a job speaking English.&nbsp; She said she hasn`t done very well as it was very quick fire and it was hard to keep her &nbsp;concentration up but I reckon that she is employing typical Japanese modesty and she has done fine.&nbsp; I know she can speak English well enough.&nbsp; She won`t find out for forty days though.&nbsp; She`s also got her job interview tomorrow and is feeling a bit stressed. Awwww.&nbsp; Good luck Reiko.&nbsp;   At the beach we went shell collecting again.&nbsp; Tommy brought along the scuba gear and cunningly enough a full on five foot long fishing spear complete with sharp prongs for spearing fish with.&nbsp; He takes it very seriously indeed.&nbsp; I think its the male hunter gatherer thing.&nbsp; Once again my fish catching and shell locating abilities left a lot to be desired but I did manage to locate a rather nice pair of sunglassses for myself&nbsp;which I&nbsp;think is much more&nbsp;impressive than a couple of miniscule salty shells.  After the&nbsp;beach (and as according to tradition) we went to the game centre in order to play arcade pachinko.&nbsp; The&nbsp;samurai pachinko machine which I have previously mentioned and which had given me so much&nbsp;success in the past today I felt was laughing at me.&nbsp; I would get the left and right slots aligning and on to the crazy Japanese aninmation but then these always went wrong.&nbsp; The samurai`s assistant would pull down the wrong symbol from the attic or the ancient guitarist`s guitar strings would break or the woman fanning the symbols along would run out of steam and collapse.&nbsp; As you can imagine this would result in much banging and a large amount of English swear words.&nbsp; But today I was defeated. And sunburnt.

      Today has been a very quiet day which I really needed.&nbsp; Last night I couldn`t get to sleep until three in the morning.&nbsp; I was reading books and watching The Awful Truth which is relatively early Michael Moore until I felt tired enough to turn the light out.   Today Reiko`s friend Maki came round at about four with her kids Dragon (Lyoma) and Tiger (Kotaro)&nbsp; I hope I have the spelling correct.&nbsp; Reiko put on A bug`s life which she had bought in China for 30p I would guess and this kept me happy whilst the kids were entertained by other things.&nbsp; I felt very at one with children today.&nbsp; Lyoma calls me Mimon and he always asks Mimon wa?&nbsp; which means where is Simon even if I am just next door.&nbsp; The kid is cool.&nbsp; The younger kid stretched out his arms to me which meant he wants me to hug him ahahahahaa aww [retch retch.] It is very strange hugging other people`s children.&nbsp; I felt at peace. Nevertheless I do not want kids for a long time yet.&nbsp; It`s mainly&nbsp;the nappies and the loss of all freedom.&nbsp; But mainly the nappies.&nbsp; I can deal with other people `s kids.&nbsp; The parents end up doing the messy part.&nbsp; I just kick a ball around for a bit and I`m just as entertained as they are.&nbsp; Simple minds....   I have been taking the dog for walks in order to make sweeps of the local area in case of kidnap/disorientation and for excercise.&nbsp; I can recognise my way from four different areas now.&nbsp; I love their dog.&nbsp; It is called Komaru and is crazy.&nbsp; It gets tied to a post all day (as is normal in Japan it seeems) and though it gets walked twice a day, is an attention seeker.&nbsp; I have been trying to instill some English discipline into it to varying degrees of success.&nbsp; It is really dangerous walking in Japan.&nbsp; They have hardly any pavements even in residential areas and the roads are really narrow.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you have a crazy beast on the end of a long leash, things can get interesting.&nbsp; It`s almost as if they are punishing you for not driving a car.&nbsp; All Japanese cars are automatic ones for some reason that I don`t understand.&nbsp; Aren`t they able to drive as well as everybody else?&nbsp; Can`t they be bothered with the effort?&nbsp; Too much time spent watching the on board DVD player?   Reiko has a job interview on Monday for a job which involves English and or French and Japanese.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is buying and selling things for a French company`s Japanese division of sportswear.&nbsp; I think I should be having the interview as I wrote her C.V and covering letter in English for her.&nbsp; I asked her if she wants me to do the job as well but she said she could do it fine enough.&nbsp; She reckons she will be on 20 grand a year which is quite nice thank you very much.&nbsp; I told her I can experience the Japanese culture and she can work, come home and cook and clean for me.&nbsp; I think that was quite fair but she wasn`t having any of it so it looks like I will have to get&nbsp;a job soon.&nbsp; What is worrying is what will happen if she gets a job and I don`t.&nbsp; Or if I get a teaching job as these are mostly in the evenings.&nbsp; What will I do all day?&nbsp; Suggestions please.

      Today we went to a Brazilian restaurant.&nbsp; That is myself, Reiko, her sister Masako and their mother.&nbsp; We all ordered food (mostly beef with something) and it all arrived and then the problems began.&nbsp;   Compared to normal Japanese portions these meals were large.&nbsp; I am unsure whether they have ever eaten anything as big as this.&nbsp; I am sure if you go to Brazil, America or even England and ate these portions, they would be standard at the least, but&nbsp; here where a couple of slices of raw fish stuck to some rice and wrapped in a thin slip of seaweed constitute a meal, I knew we would have problems.&nbsp;   And so it began,&nbsp; "This&nbsp;chicken is too&nbsp;salty &nbsp;can you eat it?&nbsp; I can`t eat all this can you take my half of beef and pork.&nbsp; Here is some fish for you"&nbsp; Only her mother was kind enough to admit that she couldn`t eat it all and left some on the plate.&nbsp; &nbsp;I chose beef curry with the portion of beef taking up at least 50 per cent of the plate for the main reason that the menu was in Portuguese as well as Japanese and  Bife Curry  was the only meal there&nbsp;which &nbsp;I could understand.&nbsp; I noticed as well that this meal came with both rice and chips on the same plate.   So I got to work.&nbsp; Saving the chips for later, I ploughed into my plate thinking of the shame that might come to my beloved home land should I fail in my Herculian task and leaving at the end, a sparklingly clean plate that any fairy liquid advert would be proud to show as the end product.&nbsp;   The only thing is that I felt like Mr Fattety Fatman Esquire from Fatdom Lardoland after the deed had been done.&nbsp; I acknowlege that calling me fat is an insult to the weighty traditions of the horizontally challenged but after seeing their almost sickened faces by my actions, I almost had the urge to&nbsp;go to the toilets and recall the evidence through the way it had come in in shame.&nbsp; This almost occurred when we went to pay as there was a glass window giving sated customers the opportunity to see raw meat being cut up and packaged off for resale - A sight I did not want to witness.&nbsp; I exited as soon as I could....   Later that day we went to a....well how to describe it?&nbsp; It was a kind of shopping/ leisure centre which had a massive rollercoaster going through it.&nbsp; Because I had promised Reiko some months ago that I would never take her on a rollercoaster without her consent again after&nbsp; reducing her to tears on a ride in England thinking that her cries of "No I do not want to go on this ride I hate rollercoasters" were in jest, I went on it with her sister instead.&nbsp; It was a good ride with a very hallucinogenic section involving a tunnel and some swirling mulicoloured strobe lights.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Today is Eel day.&nbsp; Everybody eats eel today. This makes me happy as&nbsp;I like eel.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got treated like a panda today though when I ate eel.&nbsp; The people on the table next to us in the eel restaurant said in Japanese and very loudly to Reiko "He uses chopsticks ( hashi ) well doesn`t he"&nbsp; Pretending not to understand I carried on eating.&nbsp; "Is he American?" and so on.&nbsp; Fortunately we were finishing our meal and so could exit quite quickly.&nbsp; Reiko (who loves being the centre of attention) is getting irritated by this as well as I am (unwillingly) often the centre of attention.&nbsp; I hate being stared and talking to people I don`t know.&nbsp;   I am getting used to being a panda now though.&nbsp; When children see me they will often stand rooted there in surprised schock with open mouth gawping at me with their parents ushering them away before I inflict any pyschological damage on them by just being there.&nbsp; This often happens with older people as well.   However, I am becoming a master of knowing what someone is talking about (or more importantly if somebody is talking about me) by only understanding a few words.&nbsp; If I here the words  Aygo  (English),  Igirisujin  (English person)&nbsp; gaigokujin  (foreigner) etc. I know I`m being discussed and can sit there pretending not to understand.&nbsp; This can make me quite paranoid as well.&nbsp;If I here a Japanese speaker say Simon, babble on for a bit in Japanese and then everybody starts laughing it can be very unnerving.&nbsp; A lot of their words are English words adapted or the same in English and so I can often understand what is going on by only understanding that word (Karaoke, Frisbee, Game Centre, )   Yesterday in Tokyo the temperature got to a record 39.5 degrees and it was 30 degrees in the night time.&nbsp; Fortunately in Osaka it`s (only) around 35 degrees in the daytime.&nbsp; But we are still in sweat whilst standing, lying down and&nbsp;walking territory. I go through two T-shirts and have two cold showers every day.&nbsp; It`s still not enough.&nbsp;   I did karaoke yesterday.&nbsp; I really love it in Japan.&nbsp; Instead of singing in front of 50 people you don`t know, you go into a small soundproof room in your group (two to twenty) and sing your heart out for a bit and it`s a lot more fun.&nbsp; You also get a selection of free drinks included.&nbsp; We went in one for an hour and I had three whisky`s and Reiko had her oolong hai drink and it came to three quid each.&nbsp; Unfortunately after that, I was in the mood for drinking and went off and had a tequila in a bar and was pretty rat arsed and brought shame upon the Shiraishi family....

      Well I haven`t written anything for six days so I thought I should at least put down what has happened, yet it isn`t as interesting as octopus attacks and&nbsp;earthquakes.&nbsp; Anyway do you really want to know what I had for breakfast or&nbsp;how many showers I had today?  &nbsp; I have however been to see some films Spiderman 2 and Harry Potter 3.&nbsp; I liked Harry Potter much more than corny lines and video game-esque Spiderman.&nbsp; Reiko liked the Harry Potter film more than she thought she would although she loves the Spiderman film more.&nbsp; There are two versions of western films in Japan&nbsp;- one with Japanese subtitles and English sound and one with Japanese voices.&nbsp; We have watched the English one of course. &nbsp; I&nbsp;have been to many more onsen. Some near breweries, in the mountains indoors and outdoors.&nbsp; They are amazing if you are knackered or stiff muscles.&nbsp; As the water&nbsp;comes from&nbsp;deep in&nbsp;the ground, they have many minerals such as magnesium and calcium etc. which is really good for soft skin  darling!&nbsp;  I have been trying to get rid of my beer belly so I have been taking the dog for a walk and I will be trying out for an ultimate frisbee team soon.

      So recently I have been doing many things.  For example, when I first arrived in Japan, we thought it would be a good idea to go to a meeting for foreign people living in Japan to get to know each other so I wouldn`t feel so isolated.  Three weeks later and I don`t feel that isolated but it was time to go on Sunday and so I went with Reiko.   There were about 30-40 people there of many nationalities - Thailand(ese?), Korean, Chinese, Nepalese, South African, Jamaican, English (me aha) and Japanese.  In fact there were about 15 Japanese people, which seems a bit pointless when you are trying to meet foreigners but there you go.  We at first had to stand up and introduce ourselves, which I hate doing anyway.  Reiko told me some phrases to say so I managed to say in Japanese -Hello, my Japanese is not so good, my name is Simon and I am English, pleased to meet you)  Then after that we had about half an hour where we went around and met lots of people.  I met a woman who worked on the local council who had a husband who was a German professor at the local university and who might be able to get me a job (networking aha.)  I also met the South African and Jamaican guys who lived in Kobe as car scrap merchants and were really funny.    Then suddenly the organisers said could everyone sit down and shut up as we were to listen to the Nepalese bloke play some pipe music.　　I had met the Nepalese bloke already.  He was a really nice person and spoke flawless Japanese after living in Japan for only a year.  He had changed into traditional costume and got his pipes out and a machine which he switched on.  This machine repeated the sound Ning..Nong over and over again.  He introduced himself and proceeded to play on his pipe.  He wasn`t bad but imagine if you will with me. Close your eyes and play in your head Ning..Nong slowly over and over again with some simple pipe melody repeated over and over again as well.  Then, just when you think he will stop and await the applause, he either a) introduces a new melody which he repeats over and over again for another ten minutes or b) stops and gets a smaller pipe and plays similarly tiresome melodies over the droning Ning..Nong machine.  I was wondering if he was trying a group hypnotism experiment.  I felt like I was going under - I checked my wallet afterwards but it was still there.    So after forty minutes of this (and only three songs), the Japanese bloke he had come in with and who was taking photographs for posterity, made a brave decision and told him in a nicer way than I could have managed that we had suffered enough.  We all politely clapped and breathed an inward sigh of relief.  I was glad that I could get back to talking with people but fate had other plans for me.  After the forty minutes of Nepalese pipe music, we were to be treated to an amateur opera performance by a slim middle aged women.  She was able to get very high notes　which was amusing as she ha ha heed her way through some Japanese songs.  There were fortunately only two of these songs and then it was time for the group rendition..  Close your eyes and imagine if you will again, an A4 sheet of white paper with Japanese characters written on it.  Remember kind reader, that this is a meeting for people who are not Japanese and yet no thought had been taken for those who could not read or write in the beautiful and flowing scripture which is the Japanese language.  Does it strike only me as strange that such a thoughtless act could have occurred?  Reiko and I were sitting at either end of the South African and Jamiacan guys, who were called Johnny and Johnston and none of us save Reiko could speak Japanese. Fortunately she transcribed it into English letters so that we were all Ryo Shiri and Hyo Kara-ing away with the best of them to gasps of amazement from the natives.  We all nodded sagely and continued..  Now I thought the point of this meeting was to get to know foreigners living in the Osakan area and not to sit in silence listening to droning Nepalese pipe music and amateur renditions of Japanese opera songs.  To cap it all there was a game of bingo and after completing a line, I had to fight my way through round after round of Paper Scissors Stone to claim my prize which turned out to be liquid soap. Is there some message here?  Do Japanese people have something to say about my hygiene?  Bring it on.  There were some positive points to be drawn from this.  I met Jonny and Johnston who live in Kobe and were good people and I met this incredible old blind Japanese bloke who spoke good English and was really funny but the point of the meeting was to meet foreigners and not give some people an ego trip.   Anyway, before I was a novice in the wonders of Nepalese pipe music, I went with Reiko, Tommy, Maki, Tiger and Dragon to the beach where we went around in the ocean looking for things to eat in the sea.  Tommy went out for shells and showed me where to look and he went off in deep concentration.  I on the other hand and in competitive mood, went on the search for fish.  With my bare hands, I attempted to catch the fish in the sea but I had no success.  I eventually found some mussel like things from some seaweed which were easy pickings.  Then I picked up a stone about the size of a ping pong ball which had some seaweed grwing on it and found out it was a hermit crab.  I was loathe to put it in my pocket due its large pincers and so chucked it back.  Then came my good fortune.    I found a jam jar on the floor and picked it up.  Inside it were some mussel like things again but more interestingly an octopus about the size of my hand.  It was purple and had suckers on its thick and slimy tentacles.  I was taken aback with shock and my mind raced as I tried to remember if they were poisonous or not.  Then it suddenly woke up and decided to exit as soon as possible.  Endulge me once more dear reader and make your thumb and forefinger on your left hand meet and make a cylinder with your remaining fingers the size of a jam jar.  Then thrust your right hand throught the cylinder and wiggle your fingers around the top of the jar.  Short of being semi-naked and in the middle of an ocean you are now in the position I was in.  After deciding that I wasn`t going to take the risk of injury, sting or poison, I let go of the jam jar and the creature swam away never to be seen again.  On a more serious note, I have also been trying to learn Hiragana which is one of the Japanese character systems.  These are very ugly letters and hard to draw as well as not being nearly as sleek as the Katakana ones.  For example AH あ in Hiragana compared to SHI シ　in Katakana. I hope you can see this okay.  I prefer Katakana as they  seem more stylish and are easier to draw. You try drawing あ　-it`s hard)  In a bookstore, Reiko bought me a childrens` learn to write Hiragana book and I am working my way through that at the moment.  I can recognise about ten of these characters at the moment.    I have also spent all of today in a very famous onsen in Wakayama (I think.)  The water is like silk - very very smooth I went with Tommy and his family and Reiko and her mum.  We split up and I repeated six or seven times the pattern of dry Sauna for ten minutes ice bath for five.  I like it there,  As I have been writing this, we have just experienced an earthquake.  It measured three on the Richter scale and the television programme was interrupted with notification.  It wasn`t a massive one.　There was a rumble and the earth shook a bit (ahaha.)  Reiko asked me if that was an earthquake (which is a stupid question to ask seeing as I have never been in an earthquake before.) I said it was a probably a heavy truck going past outside because that what it felt like and then a couple of minutes later the announcement came on tv.

      Well I played 5-a-side football yesterday which they call futsal.  I almost died in the process but I played it.  I gave a fairly good representation of myself.  The rules were each game lasts 6 minutes kick ins not throw ins and no slide tackles (nobody told me this until I took somebody out) and we had two hours of this playing one game and one game off.    The bloke who beats me at everything got a hat trick and I didn`t score any but they want me back for another go and I had a lot fun. I also reckon I am better at footie than him and with a bit of practice I`ll kick his arse.  The pitch was a lot bigger than I expected.  I was advised to bring two litres of water and I played two games at the start and couldn`t breathe. I drank most of my water as well.  They weren`t as good as I thought they would be and so I was happy. aha

      I had another holiday day again yesterday.  I got up at about ten and then a couple of hours later we were drivng to the beach.  We played frisbee and footie and I saw a jellyfish for the first time. Then we went to this arcade game centre and played on pachinko.  This is a game which is a cross between a fruit machine, a video game and a game of pinball.  It`s in the film Lost in Translation. You have a dial which you turn which releases balls vertically.  You have to try and get them in this hole in the bottom centre of the board.  This is very  tricky.  When you do this the fruit machine part goes into play and you have to get three of a kind.  When you get four balls in the hole, you start getting luckier. You get these animations in the screen of ninjas fighting and if they win you usually win.  I was playing on a samurai one and was getting seriously addicted to it shouting and swearing at it.    I was winnning big.  I had two pots of tokens full of coins after about an hour of winning nothing.  The one I was playing on was only in an arcade centre and so you wouldn`t win any money but if you play in a proper pachinko centre you can easily win 500 quid.  The game is therefore very popular in Japan.  You can imagine it can`t you. I come to Japan for a job and leave with a gambling problem.  Nice.

      Today was the most humid day by far for me.  I woke up sweating water like a >insert fat person in sauna joke here  I got some books out of the library today on Reiko`s card.  These help keep me sane when everyone is babbling on in Japanese and I can`t understand them.  I took back Harry Potter and the Philosopher`s Stone and The Hound of the Baskervilles and got out Pride and Prejudice, some shorter Sherlock Holmes stories and the original Grimm Fairy Tales.  Some of these are really sick everyone gets burned, crushed, beaten and maimed so I`m enjoying them.  Aha.  I am looking forward to tomorrow as one of Reiko`s friends is taking us to the beach. Its the family whose kids are called dragon (Ryoma) and tiger (Kotaro.) They go surfing and we may be doing it as well.  I just checked my phone for the weather forecast (hee hee hee) and it says it will be 33 degrees tomorro.  On Wednesday, I am playing five a side football with her husband.  I haven`t played football for ages and I hope I won`t be crap.  I`m also trying to get rid of my beer belly as well by getting some exercise.  I am quite competitive and this bloke has beaten me at everything we`ve played (Computer football, chess, pool etc. etc.) Luckily we are playing on the same team this time so I am happy,  he`s a really nice bloke as well which is good.  Ok that`ll do.  Bye bye

      As I haven`t done a lot since last time, I thought I`d talk about the wonderful naked and public bathing experience of the onsen.  The `onsen` which I visit are public baths.  As Japan is on a large fault line with lots of volcanoes and things, there are areas where natural hot water springs occur.  I went to a new one yesterday which showed the temperature of the baths digitally at 43 degrees Celsius.  These are full of minerals and the like, which are therefore good for you as well as being incredibly relaxing.  The Japanese have built public bathing centres around these, which as well as having the water piped up into large bathing areas, also have saunas, steam saunas, massage baths, where jets of water get sprayed from all sides, and scented baths such as rosemary and silk as well.  You pay about 600 yen which is three quid and you can stay in there for as long as you want.  In fact you can stay the whole day if neccessary which is what many old age pensioners often do.  They close normally at about one in the morning.  These centres also have restaurants and at some you can buy bottles of the water or in sprays for medical purposes.  There are also washing areas in these onsen where up against a couple of walls you have maybe 15-20 mirrors with their own shower, tap, dish and mirror where you wash yourself.  The Japanese bathing experience at home is also peculiar.  The baths are much deeper - about one and a half times as deep as a western bath.  This is filled with really cold water and heated elecronically (even their baths are computerised) and covered with a heavy wooden mat when not used to keep it hot.  The whole family will use the same water in the bath.  What is different from the West is you have a stool and a kind of plastic dish which you use to scoop the water from the bath and pour on yourself to wash your body and hair physically outside of the bath.  When you are clean, you get into the bath and bathe. Of course in the heat at the moment, I have been restricting myself to ice cold showers instead of undergoing further sauna conditions.  The toilets are also bizarre for a Westerner.  When you flush the toilet, the top part of it normally acts as a sink, you wash your hands with the water replacing the water in the basin.  Water.  Onsen.  Nice.

      On Wednesday  we went to buy some clothes and I spent a large proportion of my insubstantial funds on them.  This is my own fault really as we brought a lot of clothes with us on the plane.  We were in fact 20 kilos over between us (the customs bloke in Osaka airport stoppped us as he thought I was smuggling stuff in as we had so much) but thankfully  the lovely lady at the check in in Heathrow decided to turn a blind eye to it.  All thanks to Reiko I`m sure.  Having unpacked the 10th jumper in the 30 degree heat and realising that as it hasn`t yet got below 20 degrees in the day and that I actually need t-shirts and short sleeved shirts and not jeans and jumpers, this was a neccessity.  After shopping we went to the beach and I got my first ever feel for warm sea water.  The beach wasn`t as good as Poole or Bournemouth`s but the water was incredible.  It was like having a lukewarm bath instead of an ice bath in England.  I feel this when I am in a car.  Even with the windows wound down and my head out of the window for wind, it feels like a hairdryer on the low heat instead of a cooling sensation.  This obviously makes a difference to England which I am pleased for though.  Thursday was a very good day.  Reiko and I saw the Hanshin Tigers play baseball against the Tokyo Giants.  This is a very popular game as it is the equivalent of Manchester United against Arsenal.  It also meant I could get drunk and bang two mini baseball bats with 50,000 other maniacs to cries of kattobaseh fujimoto (hit it hard fujimoto) and  HOME LUN HOME LUN GEORGIE.  Reiko has to help me out with the chants a lot as I get the names wrong or don`t understand the chants.  They also have a Hanshin Tigers song which I want to learn and sing it with everyone else.  I got some funny looks from people in the crowd, but after their initial shock, I think they are happy that I am at least not supporting the other side.    Hanshin Tigers won 11-0 and the bloke who`s top I have (Akahoshi) played incredibly scoring some runs and as Tokyo are my most hated baseball side, I had a good time.  I`ve really got into baseball.  A lot of the time it`s blink and you miss it stuff.  I often am there trying to follow the chants and the number of times you should hit the bats together for the particular chant and then the bloke throws it and he`s off.  Japan have a team for the olympics this year and Fujimoto is in it so I`ll be following that I hope.  That day I also saw the Prime Minister of Japan.  It is election day on the 17th July I think and he was in Osaka campaigning.  In Japan all of the candidates hire vans or buses with many loudspeakers on them and babble away in Japanese with their followers on the bus in a kind of uniform with gloves etc smiling and waving at everyone in the street hoping that some people wave back.  I saw Mr Koizumi the prime minister in Osaka centre flanked by about 12 security staff on the top of his bus.  He looked a bit funny as he was about 2 feet smaller than his security giving him the impression he was a midget babbling on in Japanese.  I caught the word America a couple of times but didn`t understand what he was saying.  He is a very popular Prime Minister and will probably get reelected this time as well. aha  It sounds like I am just having a bit of a holiday and not making anytime to finding a job doesn`t it.  Well that`s correct and I think I deserve it.  What do you think?  Do you want to fight about it?  Just kidding, I have made some effort to find a job. We also went to the advice bureau for foreigners trying to find work in Japan.  They advised we go to another association which we`ll probably do on Monday.  Maybe.      I had a bit of a holiday day today as well.  We went to Nara which is a city near Osaka.  They have deer running around wild in the parks and often in the streets.  It was possibly the hottest day so far of my stay and I am going brown instead of white to red and back again which I am happy about.  I saw the most unexpected thing as well.  We went to the lake in Nara and I looked in expecting to see some birds like swans and the like but I saw lots and lots of turtles.  I couldn`t believe it.  I took loads of pictures but with their weird looking green and red striped serpent heads and feet they started looking a bit sinister - a bit like massive spiders swimming so I stopped looking at them.  Reiko`s mum took us for dinner in Nara hotel which is a really old hotel where royalty stay when they visit Nara.  I had eel which I thought was going to be disgusting and slimy but tasted like white fish.  They had covered it in soy sauce and grilled it and served it on rice in a very traditional japanese ceramic box.  Eel is supposed to be good for stamina as well aha so I was happy about that. aha again!  The mosquitos have stopped biting my hands and arms and have decided that as my legs are (or rather were) virgin territory for them, they had better make a go of taking them on like the Americans did with the Indians.  I have a whole batch of mini colonies on my left leg.  I look like a bloke with some awful contagious disease.  I expect to come down with malaria or Hepatitus B within the month.  (I realise this may not be funny a month down the line in hospital at death`s door.)  Well that`s about it for this time, I`ll try and write more often so that each post can be a bit shorter. aha!  Bye bye.

      Well as you may have guessed I have worked out how to do pictures on this. Thanks to the lovely people at flickr.com. This means a significant increase in my phone bill but I feel like a kid with a new toy. I am conscious that I don`t want to bore you with a photo album of my stay in Japan but then again.  I haven`t done anything of note since the last written post. The okonomiyaki is kimu-chi (a Korean spice which played havoc with my piping last night) and cabbage pancakes which we had with squid tentacles. Notably they are delicious. I recommend them.

      We went to a new onsen or sento on Saturday. These sento do not have special spring water but merely natural water yet this one was incredible and my joint favourite one. The best thing about this sento is that they have three large stone pots which have running water pour into it. I sat in one with legs sprawling out the side and it was incredible.  Japan won the Asian cup on Saturday 3-1 against China. Although they did this by beating the combined might of Jordan, Bahrain and China they could still teach the allegedly all powerful English something about winning. Reiko thinks I was secretly supporting the Chinese as everytime a Chinese player fell under a crunching Japanese tackle or a Japanese player dived I said so but oh well.  On Sunday it was Reiko`s birthday and so we went to the city centre and ate and shopped. We also went to a chocolate cafe where everything is made from chocolate. The cake is chocolate, the beer is chocolate and the tables are made out of chocolate. Well maybe the last one isn`t true but anyway you get the idea. I had a cup of hot chocolate, which was surprisingly bitter. But it came with two chocolate balls which seemed to come from the finest Belgian chocolate kitchen. OISHEE!  Then we did an hour and a half of karaoke at 140 yen (or 70p) for half an hour and free alcoholic tea included. I had a good time. Now they have a meter on the side of the screen which measures if you have hit the right note and if you are in time etcetera and they rate your performance against all the people that have sung that song (allegedly in the whole of Japan) We got a few first places especially as we chose mainly English songs which aren`t so well known here. I sung the Monty Python classic "Sit on my face and tell me that you love me" and garnered a first place position by being the only one to have attempted this composition. I reckon you should win something but it was just for honour.   Today after dreaming about dangerous water spiders which looked like NES systems (!????) we went for a barbecue by the beach. It wasn`t actually on the beach but on a small field next to a beach (which was incidentally next to an airport with shadow provided by a motorway high up above) but nevertheless a good time was had by all. We were taken by Maki and Tommy and their kids again. I spent all day amusing myself by kicking footballs and throwing frisbees and generally feeling like the third child. I managed to reduce Kotaro (who only recently celebrated his first birthday) to tears by directing a high velocity football at his face. Tommy jokingly said "You bastard" and I am sure he only half meant it?

      Today I was treated like a panda again in the Japanese-Italian wonder restaurant that is Colore.  We went with some of Reiko`s mother`s friends and ate heartily.  After that Reiko and I went to the city centre to buy Heat magazine in HMV and did two solid hours of karaoke and alcoholic tea drinks (My thraot aches) and then it was shopping for Reiko`s birthday on Sunday (8 August.) I got her something nice ahahahahahaha!

      Today I spent most of the day in an onsen.  There is something very liberating about standing naked outside or in waist-high water. I recommend it. After the onsen I ate sashimi which is raw fish and rice and some more green tea ice cream OISHEE!  Reiko got a letter from the job she applied for saying she hasn`t got it.  I think this is good as we can spend more time together and go to Yamaguchi.  She was okay about it which is good too.  I also gave a cockroach a slow and painful death. Something which I am not proud of. It has spent the last hour on it`s back writhing obviously in a lot of pain. But it is very large and slimy and I don`t want to go near it. On top of it all they fly. It has started to click as I write this. I am unsure if it is dying or calling for reinforcements. Beware the cockroaches..

      Last night we went into the city centre to watch some fireworks (hanabi).  This was an opportunity for Reiko to wear her Yukata which is a traditional Japanese robe.  The fireworks were okay but they were mostly obscured by the large buildings in the city centre and as I had seen this kind of thing before many times they seemed to pale into insignificance amongst the bright neon lights of the city.  Also as food is much more important than anything in the Shiraishi family, the fireworks were quickly abandoned for a local Chinese restaurant where we met up with Reiko`s father for a meal.  In the restaurant there was a TV showing the Japan versus Bahrain game in the Asia cup quarter final which is on in Beijing.  I tell you these Japs could teach us something.  They pass quickly and seem to live on limitless luck.  In the previous game it was one all and down to penalty kicks.  Japan missed their first two penalties and still managed to win after sudden death penalties thanks to an incredible save by the Japanese goalie.  In this game they won by four goals to three thanks to a goal near the end of extra time.  I reckon they should come to England and give a lecture on luck acquiring skills.  Today I saw Maki and Tommy and their kids Lyoma (Dragon) and Kotaro (Tiger) and went to play football and on a kite (with varying degrees of success) in what the Japanese would call a park and the English would call a gravel pit.  It rained, there were tears all around and having been bored being left with the kids, Maki and Reiko zoomed off in the car (unawares to us) leaving us to kick a football in the rain.  The rain has fortunately plunged the heat down so I can just about tolerate the heat.  Today I also gained my Izumi city citizen card and am now fully registered as an Osakan citizen mwaa ha ha!   I am addicted to Harvest Moon on the GBA and green tea ice cream and am being forced to listen to questionable Japanese pop groups called Mr Children (sinister overtones anyone?), Bump of Chicken (?) and GLAY.   By the way I am still alive as you may guess by my relatively regular posts here so if anyone actually fancies contacting me, you know my email address.  Apologies but subtle hints never seem to work in my opinion.....  Bye bye.

      Well I didn`t go surfing in the end and I didn`t see the fireworks.  That`ll teach me for writing about something that I am going to do instead of writing about things I have done.  The waves weren`t big enough on Friday as the typhoon changed direction slightly and Osaka was on the outskirts of it.  We drove about three hours on the way to Wakayama which cost fifteen quid for the driver each way on the toll roads.  Then we realised there was no surf and so sunbathed and swam instead.  I saw lots of weird fish like yellow and black striped ones which I tried to catch without success with my hands again.  Saturday, I was left on my own in the house and enjoyed a very good day free of being moaned at whilst everyone else either worked, shopped or played Pachinko.  On Sunday I played Ultimate frisbee with some Americans in a large park in Osaka at Shinkanaoka.  You could have called it the foreigners married to Japanese women club.  These people were incredible at it, doing throws such as hammer throws which I can`t (yet) do.  Not having played it for about eight years I was out of practice and they used a much lighter and larger frisbee than I was used to.  As it progressed it seemed that whichever team I was on invariably lost until I finally got used to the weight of the frisbee and remembered how to catch it and I started to get good at it.    I scored some and made a couple of points and we won the final game.   These people were built like brick shit houses and having been in Japan for anything between four to nineteen years spoke fluent Japanese.  There were a couple of Japanese natives who also played and I couldn`t converse with them.  This has shamed me into attempting to speak more Japanese to people.  Inbetween each punishing game, these people would down beer after beer and inhale copius amounts of tobacco smoke with seemingly no negative effect on their running and throwing ability .  This was the same when I played the five a side football.  I don`t understand how these people do it.  I blame only myself for being a fat, lazy bastard but every single muscle aches now.  I know this means it is working and that I may lose my pot belly and gain legs thicker than that of a chicken.  This morning (Wednesday) I can still feel the pain and struggled down the stairs like an invalid.  Oh well stop moaning you lazy git and feel the burn.  After the frisbee and having missed the fireworks, we went to an onsen where I soothed my aching, aching muscles.  There was this thing called a healing sauna.  This is where there were about twelve human sized rectangles in the floor which were filled with stones and some metallic plates.  You lay down on the rectangle with a towel to cover the stones and then they turn out the lights and lock you in there.  These stones get heated from below and cause you to sweat profusely.  I was told that it would only last fifteen minutes so near to the end I was thinking I have to get out now I think I am going to die this has to have been fifteen minutes by now doesn`t it?  After a cool down and some more onsen I felt refreshed and wanting for bed.  Yes.
