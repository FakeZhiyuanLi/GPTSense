       Don't you just hate it when people use fake accents?   This is one of my pet hates and it really winds me up! You might not have noticed that people around you do it, maybe you just take it for granted that they do and consider it normal, but I don't. I consider it anything but normal. Try the word&nbsp;ANNOYING. I really only know two people that do this, and I hope I don't come across anyone else that does it... for their sake!   There's a girl in my year (I won't name names, let's call her 'Sandra') and she's been through alot this year. She's been engaged and she's suddenly changed from a wollyback to a scouser. Now nothing against scousers here because the two main contributors on this site will kick my ass. No seriously, I was born and bred in Liverpool so you could say I was one myself. My dad's pretty damn scouse too! Just I've known 'Sandra' (yes, put your two&nbsp;hands in the air, extend your&nbsp;index and middle fingers and bend them&nbsp;twice [air quotes lol])&nbsp;since year 7 and she's always been a wollyback! I thought it was pretty weird when she started talking scouse one day! All it took was a liverpudlian boyfriend and 'Wham'... new accent! I've learnt to deal with it, but everyone's noticed and its too noticeably fake. Anyone who's in my year will know what I'm talking about.   And again... my sister. Her and her friends have this annoying American accent they use when they're with each other. ARGH it winds me up!&nbsp;I thought she might have grown up a bit since like 4 years ago, but it turns out I was wrong. Very wrong. Everytime I hear it I cringe! She sounds like a freaking cheerleader gone wrong. Blow my brains out&nbsp;please. Does anybody else have friends or siblings that do this as well? I think it's just me :S   One circumstance I don't mind people putting on accents, is when&nbsp;they're doing an impersonation. Then it's just fun and cool! I'm personally not good at accents so if I'm doing an impersonation it tends to be in my accent (except for Bond and Arnie), so you won't hear an accent that's not mine too often lol.   Phew there's a ton and a half lifted off my chest!

       Ok so the latest on the press? A year ago a kid murdered another kid, they were like 14 or something, anyways the kid said he did it because he played the game 'manhunt' and thought it'd be cool to kill some guy he knew. Now for those who arent into computer games, Manhunt is a game where you basically run around and kill people in all kinds of grusome ways, the more horrible it is the more points you get, or something along those lines (I've never played it but I sure want to!). Anyways if you are a stuck up prick then yes you could say that playing these types of games could lead to angry people going out and killing people, however.... If you are of sane mind, you will see things very differently, here are my opinions on the matter..  &nbsp;  The kid was 14, the game was rated 18.. (can ya see where I'm going with this?) First thing you think is how disgraceful that shops these days selling kids these games thats rotting their minds. I thought that too, but like you i was WRONG! The shop refused to sell the child the game.. how did the pubesant brat with a mind of a sponge get his spunk crusty hands on them???? His Parents bought it him.  &nbsp;  Now hold up, the parents buy him a game rated 18/Adult, and they wonder how their little boy gets a disturbed mind? O.k. Then...  &nbsp;  The reason I'm talking about this now is that i've just heard now that there aer currently talks about how all these not so nice games are going to be banned?! Say What?! Just because this 14 year old who didnt even get served with the game, his parents bought it him, played this game, and murdered someone, ALL violent games are going to be banned?!?  &nbsp;  I've played all of these games:  Hitman (where you play the role of an assassin)  GTA (where you rob cars and kill people)  GTA3 (Same as above but in 3d and more graphic)  GTA:VC (Same as above but the story plot of the game revolves around drug smuggling)  The Quake Trilogy (monster shoot em up)  Counterstrike (Kill the Opposite Team)  &nbsp;  Now just because ive played and in most instances completed these games for the past, oh i dunno 7 years? (yes again some of these I was underage when I played them, however..) I have never killed anyone, stolen a car, smuggled drugs, used a hooker or axed an evil monster, these games havent effected me in the slightest.  &nbsp;  I think its sick that some fucked up kid with crap parents and a playstation can simply blame murder on the fact he played a particular game, does that mean its ok for me to do drugs cos i've seen it on telly? Or 'Fuck the Po-lice' just because I heard it on a CD? Does it make it ok to go around chasing faries just because thats what I did when I played zelda? The answer no its not, I cant believe a bull shit story like this could even be considered, its silly I hope the lad spends his life in prison and is charged with being a bint and never allowed near any form of media ever again for fear the influences given off by media will make him kill more people or some crazsy shit.  &nbsp;  And if they do ban violent games, what will happen to all the people who want to vent their anger in&nbsp;a fantasy role without actually harming anyone in real life.. I.e. when i get pissed off I own some noob on CS and I feel much better, I'll tell you what'll happen, theyll buy guns and take it to the streets.. Good bye Liverpool, Hello Compton!     &nbsp;  I've just found out that the boy in question was a drug addict in serious debt, the use of drugs caused him to not be able to perceive the difference between the game and reality.. they failed to mention however that it was simply the fact he was a crackpot looney kid who just murdered his mate for money to settle his drug debts and is using this stupid idea of the games influencing him and an escape plea, because he's such a white trash piece of shit that commited such a sickening crime that no other type of plea is ever going to work.. I hope they give him the chair.

       No it's not what you think, I'm not gettin married, I'm on about the phone line in my house... constantly engaged. The culprit is none other than my little sis. Grrrrr!!! Her name is Becky and she's 14 and so fustrating sometimes!     &nbsp;   Most of the time she is on the phone to random people, for hours on end, blocking up the phone line. I mean, I don't mind a couple of hours spent chatting to a good mate,&nbsp;&nbsp;like I ring John or even my mate Nicci... but Becky, oh god no... she's different. She can spend 3 hours on the phone to people she probably doesn't know too well and from the sounds of it she never has anything decent to talk about. Maybe the odd slagging session (she can be quite bitchy!) or the silent conversation with the odd "Sooooo, what do you wanna talk about?", which may I add is usually in this stupid accent which really winds me up (but I won't get into that today.. that's a post in itself!). I feel like saying If you haven't got anything to talk about get off the phone and let others use it! People might be trying to get in touch, and there's 3 other people in the house to consider... does she ever&nbsp;think that&nbsp;we might want to ring somebody too?     &nbsp;   The amount of times I've walked into the kitchen during the day to get a drink and she'll be sat there with the phone on speakerphone balanced on the table, eating her lunch, not a word being spoken. I feel sorry for the poor sod on the other end having to listen to her muching away! Wouldn't you at least say like, "I'm having my lunch now, I'll ring you back" or something! Arrrrggghhh!     &nbsp;   Oh and her bloody sleepovers. During the weekends and most days during any school holidays she'll have people sleeping over. Anything from 1 girl to 12. And I hate it. To be honest her mates (and herself especially it seems) are quite immature for their age. They run around like loose dogs yapping and screaming! They have the&nbsp;TV on too loud, so when the rest of the family are tucked up in bed, it takes longer to get some shuteye as all you can hear or think about is those lot messing about downstairs or laughing wayyyy too loud in her room!&nbsp;I'm not being&nbsp;picky, I'm sure you'd&nbsp;say the same if you had to live with her!     &nbsp;   And to make matters worse... sleepovers and stupid phonecalls put together! Her mates and herself&nbsp;usually pile around the kitchen table with the phone on speakerphone (oh yes... yet again!) for about 2 hours, talking crap and usually not speaking at all! And the REALLY annoying thing, is that when you walk into the kitchen when they are all sat there around the table on the phone, they say "Say hello to whatsaface!" and I'm like, "How about no?!"     &nbsp;   LIVING PROOF! (Guess what, at the moment it's 23:15 and the phones just rang... parents are in bed as they both work and have early mornings (especially my dad at 5:30) and I just answered the phone and this rude little shit is on the other end, "Becca there?". Can&nbsp;they not string a sentence together properly? Most of them are scallies (ask John and he'll back me up on this. Oh goody that's another post on the people she hangs out&nbsp;with! The lot that have hidden in my house and my mates had to chase them away at night, when my rents were out!)&nbsp;And they shouldn't ring so late anyway! At least give them warning so they can pick up the phone straight away so as to not wake my rents up!)     &nbsp;   Jeese, I don't know anybody else that&nbsp;could wind me up anymore than she can! And to make matters worse I have to deal with complaints off John and even my nan! My nan lives about 3 hours away and our family don't get to see her too often. Me and John went down the stay there for a week and I felt pretty wrecked when she went on about how our line is always engaged. I had to explain about Becky and she wasn't impressed with her.. she seemed pretty upset as she mentioned that she's never able to chat with my mum anymore as she can't get in touch. &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Nuff Said Biatch

       Now this is something which is going to relate to everybody. We all use the internet, some of us more than others, some of us too much. How come everybody is so cock when using the internet? People seem to think that when they log onto the internet its like starting up some fantasy role playing game where they can do anything they want without consequences, they dont grasp the concept that if they offend people they cant just dissconnect and forget about it because one day theyre gunna offend someone who owns a car, a bad temper and some spare time, and even if they live far away theyre gunna get their ass kicked.   I love to turn up on someones door stop and go hey i'm John, remember me you called me a cunt cos i killed you whilst we were playing Counterstrike!?   Wheres his friggin gun now prick? I bet he's some scrawny sexless git as well. People like that should be banned from the internet.

       OK&nbsp;so as i mentioned I was on my driving lesson today and as I was, I was following this dude, now me and my instructor (who is female) instantly presumed it was a female drver because the car in question was going down a national speed limit road (60mph) and 30, What Fun! Anyways a few junctions later and we were still stuck behind him, we'd been behind the fella for a good 5 minutes, it appears during all this time he had never bothered to use any of his mirrors, because suddenly at one junction he decided he had taken a wrong turn, no problem he thought, the nearest car is oh i dunno 3metres away, so he jsut slipped it into reverse, reversed backwards from the junction and then shuffled forward so he was on the correct side of the junction to turn.     &nbsp;   At this point I had to slam on and was close enough (i.e. a good 15cm) to figure out it was an old man [Shock!]. Kudos to him to realising that he had to change his position in the road so following cars will know what direction he is turning, cos after all he didnt use indicators, my only problem is if he would have actually looked, a mere glance for less than a second he woiuld have seen a learner driver coming up behind him at 60mph. So really Boy Racers? What ever, I'd rather have a nova boy revving his engine thinking hes cool however driving carefully because He and everyone else knows that if he crashes his insurance premiums will go sky high and he wont be driving again till he's 24.     &nbsp;   The Real boy racers are the gits who are fifty years old theyve been driving longer than ive been alive so they obviously own the road, and no matter how expensive their BMW is even if they crash they can afford it! Despite the fact that they havent seena c opy of the highway code in 35 years!

      Ok so I was just watching the news, and there are ALOT of the articles that pissed me off so lets talk:   First of all there was a girl who has started a website because she was gettin bullied, so what did the news do? they posted a picture of her on telly, now maybe its just me, but if i was bullying someone, then i came home and put the telly on and saw that bitch making a website about me kicking her ass, I would kick the crap outta her! F00!   Also theres a new leaflet being brought out telling us what to do in the case of an emergency, one of the things was that if a BioNuclear Weapon is dropped on your head and you get infected and start dying, do not try to go home, you must wait for decontamination, i mean really? Is it that important cos I wanna go put me feet up and watch bigbrother after Osama Bin Fudge Face has just given me leprosy!   Good Lord

       I need to start off apologising for all the different fonts in previous posts, thats cos im a noob to this blogger and i cba going back and fixing it!     &nbsp;   Anyways to the article:     &nbsp;   A few years back I was watching the news when the main headline was "Japan invents Digital Pet". What's this? Sounds interesting! Tamagotchi was its name and it hit the world hard, everyone wanted one, So I did some homework...         &nbsp;   A digital toy capable of simple Artificial Intelligence that acted jsut like a real pet, It got Hungry, It shitted, and had moods and toys for it to play with, OUTSTANDING i thought, they must cost a few bob, to my surprise they didnt, so i bought one. It kept me entertained for a few hours, Then i got extremely pissed off by its annoying none stop bleeping for attention, I cleaned I played and what did i get in return? No stroking licking or loving, jsut more shitty mess to clean up as I watched it grow another pixel bigger! Eventually I ended up trying to play fetch with it but it never came back, no great loss.     &nbsp;   So 5 or so years later when Tamagotchi Connexions was release I was relcutant to say the least, But my girlfriend wanted one and I wanted to see the new infrared capabilities so I bought one too, to be honest it is alot better, Tamagotchi are crap at advertising, I bet by the end of the next paragraph you will want one? Why because its no longer a Toy but a Game.     &nbsp;   Yes this New Line of incorrectly spelt Tamagotchi Connexions has more to offer, same old crying, pooing 10 pixel high gimp, but theres more styles, to the uglyness of your digital friend can vary, 2 Different Sexes are available, and using the IR communication, you can make friends, offer each other gifts, play games, become lovers and mroe importantly Mate.     &nbsp;   No I'm not a dirty Tamagotchi Fetish man, its just that the mating is the main part of the Game, Allow me to explain...     &nbsp;   The reason I am actually interested in this New Tamagotchi and why I am plannign on keeping the little darling is that its now a matter of endurance, When you first turn your tamagotchi on you are a 1G tamagotchi, a First Generation, If you find a lover and have babies, you are a second generation. and so on and so forth so the idea is not to keep the fella alive, but to keep it alive long enough to shag and have babies.     &nbsp;   I didnt realise how enthrauling this was until I was talking to my mate Jam and he mentioned he was on the fourth Generation, now he's had his longer than me but Jesus I want to get into competition and make my digital friend fuck like a horny virgin.     &nbsp;   And so I conclude you should all buy the new tamagotchi and all get competitive as I have its fun honest, they cost just over a tenner and unlike the real pets, you can be interested about them having sex without out sounded like a pervert and when you get bored, just do as Jay did and smash it with a hammer.     &nbsp;   Warning: No Tamagotchis were harmed during the writing of this article!

       I was watching a TV programme the other day, It was a silly kids show you know where they do crap puzzles and a retarded chimpanze could perform, anyways it was doing profiles on the kids and the usual stuff popped up: I like football, dont like school favourite colour is red, I like barbie, dont like boys, favourite colour green. Then the annoying one came.. Hi my name is [who gives a shit] I like playing with my friends and dont like George Bush.      Now I could be wrong here, but before I say anything this kid was ten years old, I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm probably right in saying that what the fuck does a ten year old kid who likes playing with her friends know about international politics?!?      I think its sick that kids get it drille dinto them that G.W. Bush is a bad man because he went to war with IRAQ, and if a kid asks why he went to war with Iraq its because of oil?  OIL ?      If a kid asks who the president is, or why we went to war, tell them the truth or tell them they'll find out when they get older, after all you dont tell your kids the postman is evil just because he does his job? Don't get me wrong the postman might fuck up everynow and then, you know sleep in one day or lose a few letters, but still you call him stupid not evil?! It's exactly the same for Bush, I'm not defending him, I believed in the War and I think its  damn  wrong to call Bush evil, Stupid, yes he is stupid, but he is not a bad man!      You cannot let a kid go on television a show which other children are watching and are influenced by and say something as serious and worrying as that, else we are gunna have a generation of rebels on our hands, who to be honest, won't know what they're rebelling against, or at least they wont understand it fully.      I can only think of two plausable reasons that the kid could have said this... One is that her parents told her to, you know totally scripted because her parents are tree hugging faggots who wouldnt understand why a dictatorship isn't good even if theyre Jewish grandparents died to stop one years ago. Either that or the kid has seen some shit like Newsround the bbc news for kids show, which implants it's bias bullshit views into the minds of young kids.      To be honest it could be blamed on anyone but the kid, as son as she said it she should have been put straight, and something as serious as that should not have been shown in a childrens programme, what the hell do editors do these days?      I hope someone sets the kid straight, and anyone who goes around saying they dont like George Bush without a fully understod and explainable reason should be slapped with a trout and stay out of poitics, its people like this that keep Tony Blair in power :(

       Just a quick on because Jay is bugging me to go play Worms Armageddon!      Anyways, you know it as soon as you walk in the joint who they are, they could be sat there in silence yet somehow you know that, that 12 year old pregnant scally and her girlfriend mates are going to be noisy as hell. I say girls because it always is.      If you havent guessed what I'm on about yet its when your sat in a nice civilised place such as a restataunt or library, and there is a group of people (usually teenage girls) causing unessacery noise. I'd say that it was annoying but its more than that, annoying is when you go down for a midnight snack and theres nothing in that you fancy, or when your about to play a game online with your mate, but a thunderstorm starts and you havta turn your pc off. Not being able to talk over a civilised meal which im paying a good £40/£50 to make the missus feel special and theres a gang of retardo sluts all sitting round a table drinking bacardi breezers witha  bag of crisps because they can legally drink witha 'meal'. Making a load of racket and disturbing everyone else, I jsut fail to grasp what right they think they have.      You know whats even worse than that, when you walk into a place like subway, sit down and all is nice and then the group in question normally girls again says something uber loud, because they want you to hear, they dont want you to think that they are actually talking to them, but they want you to hear, example:       *We all much on our subways*   John: Yum   Jay: Yeah   Charli: *Burp*      Annoying Girl 1: WHAT YOU MEAN YOU FANCY THAT LAD WITH THE HAIR      {Now this is a typical scally wag statement, notice how its in caps to show it is shouted, and her friend is sat, oh i dunno 6 inches away?! also note that the description is about as precise as a potato trying to hit a target with a spoon from half a mile away, everyguy turns round, not because they actually want to be fancied, simply to give them a look that suggests almost certain death, anyway lets carry on with teh scenario..}      Annoying Girl 2: EEEWWWW NO I DON'T      {O.k. so she doesnt, no big loss, after all she looks like she fell from the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down, and shes pregnant with a 12 year olds kid, which was more than likely concieved in the bus stop across the road the month before after a heavy session of drinking cider and smoking lambert and butler. Anyways whether or not she actually fancied anyone or not, no one cares, all you hear from teh rest of teh people in subway is a sigh of relief!}      Annoying girl 1: YEAH YOU DO YOU JUST SAID YOU DO      {Like Hello? no one cares, just shut the fuck up, but the worst is yet to come}      *Annoying Girl 2 gets up and kind of stumbles over towards our table, if your lucky and its early in the day and the double vision hasnt set in from the cider yet, you may get eye contact, but i doubt it, cos lets face it, who eats subway that early?}      Annoying Girl 2: Will you snog me?!      {Now Hold up what?! You sut said you didnt fancy this dude with the hair, and even if you did you can go toss over donkey droppings for all i care because there is not a snowballs chance in hell that those cyphalis ridden lips are going anywhere near any part of my body, and to be honest im rather worried about you standing so close to me and my food just incase there is a rare form of STI that can jump on to me or my food because lets face it, this bitch gets around and it doesnt matter how rare it is, if it exists, this bitch has it.}      And so i conclude how annoying people can be in places where you just cant be doing with all the hassle, i mean sometimes it aint so bad if its on the street and your just wandering by, in that instance your only worry is that the 6ft butch bitch called Wanda isnt going to twat us for turning her down, you can always just carry on walkuing and ignore them, chances are after a few paces the alcopop will kick in and they will forget what they are doing and fall over, but in a public place where all you wanna do is sit down and have a good chat and a bite to eat its not on, there should be a fast food joint with a dress code or something to keep the scallywags out.. and you know... people wonder why im not keen on McDonalds.. Ha!

       Yep, you got it! There was a fly buzzing around my room for hours and hours last night, and I wasn't impressed!      I went to bed pretty late last night at 3ish after setting up a website. I was all snuggled up in bed about to nod off when to my annoyance I heard a buzzing sound. I jumped out of bed armed with my highway code book (I'm learning some stuff for my theory already!) waiting for the fly to show itself. I did some kung fu moves on it but it the slick bugger got away... again again and again. I must have been after it for about 10 minutes or so when it decided to hide behind my cupboards. I tried flapping my highway code around for a bit to see if it would come back out, but no show, so I left it and finally got to sleep.      In the morning I got up and went to the loo and to my dismay there was a fly buzzing around. ARGH! Can't they fly elsewhere?      Other than that the day was ok. Just messed about making a site and played a couple of rounds on good old CounterStrike and John came round. We played on Worms Armageddon for a while with Jay, ate a yummy chinese and then watched Michelle get kicked from Big Bro... I thought it was gonna be Jason tonight! How wrong was I! And because Friday TV is good (it's been better I know) I've been glued to the box for most of the evening! But of course I had a little time left to sign my blog, and here I am!      Anyways, bed for me now. Anyone got a fly swatter?      Signing out... xxx

       My first post on my blogspot!     Today was pretty good. I got up pretty late :S and watched a bit of TV, not very exciting lol. But then I mananged to drag myself out of bed and to tidy my room.. shock horror! That normally doesn't happen you see. Took me quite a bit of time but it looks nice and clean now. I even hoovered up. My job tomorrow is to polish and clean my bathroom :( anyone want to help? Then i de-smelled myself in the shower and pottered around for a while.    A little while later john called round with his kite that Jay's cousin gave us. We walked to Eccleston field even though it was looking dull and raining outside! Being brave and all (hmmm) we still had a go at flying the kite. I have to say it stayed on the ground most of the time, as there mysteriously was no wind... or we were just bad kiteflyers! You can decide lol.    Then John thought he'd spend £5 on sweets so that was that and we pigged out at my house. Yummy! I played on CS for a bit but I didn't do too well... but what's new lol. Then I remembered I had a VERY old&nbsp;PC that was lying around that I wanted to try out again! So that was that. I shifted it into my room and hooked it all up and to my surprise it ran, although painfully slowly. I thought i might manage to scavenge a few parts from it for the PC I'm going to build (in like a million years time) but no such hope as it's crap! It's as simple as that! John tried to run Linux on it but it wouldn't take it :(    Then that was that, John went home. I played more CS (and whooped John's butt may i add :P) and here I am now!    I wonder what will happen tomorrow!

       I'm going to Teneriffe tomorrow! I'll be there for two weeks.  Past few days have been cool! On Wednesday me and John went to Liverpool as I had a last few things to buy for my hols... thanks John for bearing with me :D. I got a skirt and flip-flops and some bits and bobs. We went to Jay's house afterwards and had a good pig out on some sweets we bought in Tescos (well I didn't really as I had to go home earlish to pack). We also started to watch Goodfellas (that's a great movie!). It was a fun day.  Today I packed again in the morning after I had messed on the PC for a bit. Then my Dad took us to the libary to get some good books for the beach and the plane journey etc... I ended up getting good old Harry Potter, Cujo by Stephen King (he's brill!) and a Redwall book called Marlfox. Should keep me happy! At the moment, I'm just putting some tunes onto my MP3 to take away with me. Fun fun fun!  Right early night for me.. early morning tomorrow!  Have a good 2 weeks too! xxx

       Only a quick one today as I'm very tired.   I haven't done anything out of the ordinary really. On Monday me, John and Jay nipped into town to have a mooch. I ended up getting The Sims Superstar expansion pack lol (don't moan at me... and don't underestimate The Sims!). John bought me the The Sims Unleashed expansion pack a while ago and I love it! He got me hooked lol. I can't wait for Sims 2! Then after town I went to Johns and chilled out and stuff.      Today I packed my suitcase for my holiday! I'm going to Teneriffe on friday, so my mum forced me to pack early because I always seem to forget something if I pack in a rush lol. I'm excited about it but I'll really miss John! It's only two weeks I suppose, not like it's a month... aw well :(   Then I went to John's. He formatted his PC while I watched TV and then we both watched good old CSI.      My mum picked me up around 10ish and took me to Tescos to get some last minute bits for our hols. I seen Jay and said a quick hello. When my mum and I where on our way out the security things started beeping. Jay heard and must of thought we were shop lifting! Deary me! Luckily though it was just the women on the cashtill (who was very nice may I add... my mum was having a good natter with her) had forgotten to take a security tag off a skirt I had bought. Oopsy! After all the embarrasment we went home and watched Big Brother that my dad had taped for us to watch (my parents are obbsessed as well as I am!) Then it was a game on The Sims and now here I am!      Right that's all for tonight... bedtime for me!    Nighty night xxx

       Again you got it right (how do you do that?)... I flew a kite today. I think I have done most days this week! It was fun. Me and John woke up earlyish and went straight down to good old Eccy field. It was such a nice day! Extremely hot, but unfortunately there asn't any decent kite flying wind (John believe me there wasn't any wind... you were just lucky). I was absolutely hopeless at flying it but after John give me some tips, it was easier and i managed to fly it okish for a minute or so. John's practically a pro lol. Not fair!  Then with a hop skip and a lift we went to Johns for some scrummy yummy Sunday roast. Yummy. Then I fell asleep when the other half was playing some PC games. I had a good hour or so sleep :D I needed it lol. Then we watched some TV and played a game or two and went home! I played on CS and this dummy called me a noob (which tbh I am since I've only been playing a month or two), but the problem is I had more kills than he did! I don't get it! At that point I had 5 kills and he had 2... dumbo boy. Talking about CS, last night John was slept over and we were playing on CS pretty late on. This guy had us in hysterics. He was hacking (which we DON'T agree with) but this guy was a laugh! He wouldn't admit to using hax even though he was spinning around uncontrollably and getting headshots with every shot and his number of kills was amazing! I have to admit the aim bot he was using was damn good :P His name was Mav and the amount of times he changed his name to try and confuse the people who were accusing him I needed a calculator to count. Would you believe he faked changing his name to mine to try and frame me as the hacker lol. The guys who had been on the server from the beginning when there was 3 on a team (as we were) say the funny side, the others just didn't get it lol. Oooo funny funny time!  Anyway that's about it. Just listening to some Ataris, Thrills and a Modest Mouse song called Float On that Jay recommended! C'est tres genial!  :D that's for John... get in touch tomorrow asap!  Ciao xxx
