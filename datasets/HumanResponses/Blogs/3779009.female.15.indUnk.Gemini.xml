      Well, nothing exciting happened last night but then again, what else is new?!  Today i just hung around the house, did some packing and some cleaning since i had time.  Lexie and I were real sweet today and went to another Little League All-Star Game, State College American vs. Bellefonte, lexie and i didn't really watch and at 7:30, we walked to the Teener League fields to see the real guys play...watching hot guys play baseball and acting like idiots is tons of fun!  Jackie and Jackie were also there, it was fun yet insanely boring...but oh well, lexie was there, we acted like idiots together, you know, the normal so that's always great great!  Not much else happened but if you want to hang out before i leave, call me sometime soon so i know what we're doing...;-) haha but the ;-) is only for certain people if you know what i mean... 4th of July, call my cell if you wanna hang out and watch the fireworks together, i promise a good time! haha i love you all!   Love Always,  *Spearly*  P.S. M.K. is really really hot but shh don't tell anyone!!    'Cause I am hanging on every word you say And even if you don't want to speak tonight That's alright, alright with me 'Cause I want nothing more than to sit Outside heaven's door and listen to you breathing Is where I want to be   ^Why is it that everytime i think things are going perfectly and that they're never going to end, they always seem to find a way to end and the way they end always hurts me...?^

      So last night, Lexie and I went to my little brother's (Patrick) All-Star baseball game...they lost, it was rather funny because Patrick sucks so i have fun making fun of him...i kinda feel bad but then again, i love to harass him, just because i know i can! I'm mean but i can't help it!  After that, Lexie and I came out to my house to get some stuff so i could sleep over, then we went out for dinner with my family...well all except Michelle...she was at Brandon's, like always but anyway, yes...my dad acted like an idiot, just like he always does when we are out in public, he figures that since i don't often go out with him in public, he needs to embarass me while he has a chance! but it was okay because we all had fun, i think lexie just thought we were all a little weird! When we were finally done eating, we came back out to my house to get some movies, *TOP GUN* awesome movie, good love scene, we hung out around her house for a while then watched the movie and she ended up falling asleep around 1 so i was bored until then but i did watch Top Gun again, classic movie...haha i'm a loser but it's ok!  I ended up crying myself to sleep around 3ish...it kinda sucked but then again,   Shit Happens    Anyway, today we had open gym with Bethany that seemed like it was soo much longer than it really was but it was fun to mess around with lexie at basketball again, haven't done that for a while!!  I sucked but it was still fun!!  This weekend, 4th of July, anyone who's up for hangin' out with Lexie and I at the fireworks, give me a call...all i really want is my baby back so i can lay in his arms while watching them but it doesn't really look like that's going to happen though so...anyone else?? ;-) I'll write later if anything fun/exciting happens today otherwise, there's always tomorrow!   Much Love,  *Spearly*  P.S. Lexie and I saw  LESBIANS  at dinner last night, it was kinda weird and we stared a lot but it was fun, kinda gross though...   Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game  On this endless ocean finally lovers know no shame  Turning and returning to some secret place inside  Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say  My love,  Take my breath away

      So lately, my life has pretty much sucked...there was Penn State Basketball Camp which would've been incredibly awesome had lexie gone and i not been sick, otherwise, i still had a lot of fun with Jackie n Kortne because we like to nub people...it's really great fun!  Then there is the whole part of my life where...i just suck at it in general, if it is possible for something to go wrong, it will go wrong, i guess it's just fate or something like that?  And i guess you could say i have a good 6th sense? because i know when things are going to happen, especially bad things...anyway, i'm going away to my grandparents for a while, maybe longer than a while, it depends on when i feel like comin' back if i do at all...things here just pretty much suck right now, i need to get my life back on track, if you can help...please do!  Now that i've lost the most important thing in my life, pretty much the only thing i cared about, i'm a little lost myself...i guess one true statement is: "   Love hurts   ." because sometimes, it really does but i guess there's nothing anyone can do about it... Basketball open gyms were supposed to start today but something came up with Coach so...i like it when something comes up, it makes me happy because then i get to sit at home, talk on the phone, listen to music and be lazy, that's just great! haha Just so everyone knows where they stand, no matter what's going on with me right now, i love you all more then anything and i thank you for always being there, Lexie, i love you! and thanks for the help with...you know who... Kelly, i miss you at camp this year but i know you're having fun where you are, play hard, break records and i'm always here...not that you'll ever need me, it seems like im always the one who needs you! My boys, of course you know who you are and Zach, thanks for being there for me the other night when no one else was, i love talking to you, thanks for the help babe! I'm out for now, i'll write you something else when my life is either better or more exciting...don't hope for better because that never happens and you'll just be let down, so i'll tell ya when something exciting happens!   Love Always,  *Spearly*   P.S. Don't ever make a promise that you can't keep, it makes you come off as a jackass...    'Cause you're a God And I am not And I just thought That you would know You're a God And I am not And I just thought I'd let you go

       So Thursday my day was tons of fun...actually, not so much, it was filled with cleaning the whole house top to bottom   and a lot of last minute packing but like i said, after that...lexie came over and we went to the mall so it was fun stuff and yeah, i know i already told you the story of cleaning the whole house but that has something to do with what i'm going to say later so i just thought i'd refresh your memory!    On Friday, i was trying to make plans to go see a movie with someone but found out later that he ditched us for some of his apparently cooler friends...so lexie and i just decided to see Spiderman 2, we had to see it just the two of us because we saw Spiderman together...yeah, we're cool like that, that's just why i love her!! and she's hot too!!    Anyway, now to the real story...as a select few of you already know, good news...well, depending on how you look at it but anyway, i'm not moving, i'm going to be back in good old state college for 10th grade to see all you again...i am going away for three weeks tho but no matter what happens, i will be back because i finally realized that this is where i need to be, the people i&nbsp; need in my life are here...by the way, i made this decision when i was cleaning/packing my room...i found some things in it...things that were very important to me and that reminded me of a lot of good times and friends that i had...the person that has to do with all of this already knows about it so there is no need to go into any more depth...if you care to know, you can ask me...maybe i'll share, it depends...    So anyway, now i dont get to leave until wednesday because i have to work at state college basketball camp monday - wednesday...bummer but still, i hope the time goes fast...i love you all and i'll miss you when im gone, i'll be sure to write in here the day i leave and the day i come home, i'll miss you guys so much call my cell while im gone...just to, you know, tell me how much you love me!     Much Love,    *Spearly*    P.S. Never forget about the people closest to you, the people you care about&nbsp;the most and the people who care about you the most, always listen to what they have to say, remember that they know more about you that you do, they know what's best for you, and they will always lead you in the right direction...     I don't need a lot of things      I&nbsp;can get by with nothing      Of all the blessings life can bring      I've always needed something      But I've got all I want      When it comes to loving you      You're my only reason      You're my only truth      I need you like water      Like breath, like rain      I need you like mercy      From heaven's gate      There's a freedom in your arms      That carries me through      I need you    &nbsp;

       So, Tuesday wasn't really a good day because of the movies and all...i didn't feel really good at the movies, i said and did things at the movies and after the movies that i now regret and i feel like an ass for doing them all but then, after i had cried and partially got over it all, lexie and i played some basketball in the summer rain...what could be better?? Then we came back in, dried off and wouldn't you know it, it started to pour again so we went outside, shot some hoops then went on a walk and halfway through our beautiful walk in the pouring rain, lexie and i both think...what if the bear comes out...(we were right near where i had seen the bear about a week ago) so lexie goes OMG, i hear a growling, now i hear something moving, ohh shit, and starts to run across my yard, screaming at like 10:00 at night...then again it doesn't really matter because i live in the middle of nowhere, no one would ever hear her but that's cool man, it was awesome, i chased her down and i was like lexie, shut up, there is NO bear! it was great though!!&nbsp; So after we dried off, we played some Doggit with matt and patrick...my team owned everytime might i add...then, mom yelled at us for being so loud and when we get upstairs into my room, matt texts us and asks if we want to watch the greatest movie ever...Love and Basketball...so we go down to his room and watch it, i love that movie!! We came back up to my room around 3:30 and got some good rest...well lexie did anyway, i stayed up and thought about some things for a while...    After Lexie went home wednesday afternoon, i pretty much just talked online, listened to a lot of music, played basketball and thought..about everything, and everyone...it was a boring day...    Thursday morning started well...around 1:30, matt and i watched Super Troopers...quality, not as good as Love and Basketball..but then again, not many movies are, that was a good time though, Rookie in the locker, with the shaving cream..awesome lol So i went to bed @ 4:15 and woke up at 7:20 to start cleaning the house..top to bottom...how exciting?! anyway, that was great fun, made $25...after i was done and showered, michelle and i went to pick up lexie, then after we got home we decided we were hungry so we drove down to the Fillmore general store and bought some stuff then when mom got home, she took us...where else, the mall! haha my new home! we had fun, made fun of some people, bought some stuff, got fat...yeah, it was quality...anyway, here i am now, talking to you, telling you everything you should ever know and even more about my boring life...i hope you all enjoy this because it won't last much longer, i love you all soo soo much!!!     &nbsp;  Love Always, *Spearly*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; P.S.&nbsp; Always live your life like it's your last day, never&nbsp;sit back and let the world pass you by, try&nbsp;new things, meet new people, eat different&nbsp;food but always be yourself, never let anyone try to change&nbsp;who you are...Don't worry about the outcome as long as you can&nbsp;have fun in the moment... &nbsp;  Looking back on the memory of   The dance we shared, beneath the stars above.   For a moment, all the world was right,   How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye?    &nbsp;  And now, I'm glad I didn't know,   The way It all would end,   The way It all would go,   Our lives are better left to chance,   I could have missed the pain,   But I'd of had to miss the dance.    &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      So Monday was a pretty boring day until i got a phone call from lexie since she loves me so much...and she asks me if i want to sleep over so of course...i accept but before that what do we do...go to the mall...but hey, lately, what else is new, the mall is like our new home! but it's always fun to look at nice things and wish you had the money to buy them...ever wish you were rich?! hahaha anyway, we had a great time like always, she bought a shirt, we ate food...patricia came with us, he acted real gay...like always but hey man, shit happens and little brothers are shit...not the shit, shit!! but ohh well...anyway, i slept over at lexie's house and we talked on the phone to the most amazing person ever...(can you guesss?! {dsr}) anyway, we talked for a good while and for once i was happy to just talk to him and not worry about any of the things that actually mattered like the fact that i couldn't ever be with him again...god, why does life have to suck so much?! whenver you want something,  you can't have it...it always seems to work out that way and i hate it, like woah! haha  Anyway, today, lexie came over...we hung out for a little bit then we went to the movies with a few people so i could see them one last time before i left...cept for Brennan because that was the first time i'd ever seen him but it's cool!!  We went to see King Arthur...i slept for a little bit of it...probably only like 10 minutes though so it's cool but NEVER see it, it was the most boring movie i've ever been to and what ended up happening there didn't make me to happy for my last time seeing some people...yeah, confusing, aint it?! anyway...things are pretty much patched up but i'm still going away, i will miss you all so so much but call me when im gone ill be sure to come back to visit... for now, lexie and i are going to have mad, hot, steamy sex...ill write tomorrow to tell you guys all about it because im sure your thinkin about it riiight NOW!  haha i love you all thanks so much for always being there for me!!   Much Love,  *Spearly*  P.S.  Never  give up on something that you can't live without, never run away from it, never leave it, and never pretend like you don't care anymore when deep down, you do, and you always will.  When you need something more than anything in life, you have to go after it, not fear it and run from it, that will get you nowhere...    So baby now it's up to you Do I win or do I lose? Will my heart fly or lie broken on the floor? Well take me as I am cuz I wanna be your girl But I can’t be your friend anymore  And its killin me to know you without havin a chance to hold you And all I wanna do is show you how I really feel inside You can run to me, you can laugh at me, or you can walk right out that door But I can’t be just friends anymore We can’t be just friends anymore

Anyway, i've finally made my decision on moving and i promise you all that it's not going to change anymore...I am going to go this sunday, the 18th and stay there until the 4th at which time i have to come home for my parents big anniversary thing...anyway, after spending those 3 weeks, i will decide if i want to stay or if i want to come back home so there really isn't a definite yet...just that i will be gone for 3 weeks...so we are all going to the movies on the 16th, anyone and everyone who wants to come, i want to see you all again before i leave!!!! I love you all so so much!!! Im not sure of particulars for the movie like time, place, or even what we are seeing but no one make any plans for friday night so you can come hang out!!!  Love always,  **Spearly**  P.S. I love you through thick and thin, whether near or far, happy or sad, good or bad, i love you always and forever...i've grown so much from everything that happened between us and you have grown to be a part of me, i will never forget you, you'll always be in my heart, i love you, more than anything!    Lying close to you feeling your heart beating And I’m wondering what you’re dreaming Wondering if it’s me you’re seeing Then I kiss your eyes And thank God we’re together I just want to stay with you in this moment forever Forever and ever  Don’t want to close my eyes I don’t want to fall asleep Cause I’d miss you baby And I don’t want to miss a thing Cause even when I dream of you The sweetest dream will never do I’d still miss you baby And I don’t want to miss a thing

      So,today...Lexie came over, i love that girl so much!!  Anyway, we were supposed to go to Patrick's baseball game and she didn't get here until 5 so matt got angry that we weren't ready in time but that's okay, he almost left without us but we own him, yay for that! haha anyway, after we were at the game for like 30 min or so, we went downtown to see  Anchorman .  It was a pretty funny movie, gay in some spots but that's okay, a lot of people were there so we all had fun, Garret and Nick sat next to me, acted like idiots the whole time and wouldn't leave me alone, i beat nick up a lot so it was great haha he's all like men are better than women...anyway, lexie owes me a dollar from the movie so im going to have to get that from her!!!  After the movie was over, Tini, Lexie and i walked around downtown, went to Coldstone, yay!!! haha anyway, the whole night we were talkin about being raped and how much of a possibility there was, then when we were least expecting it, some like 25 year old guys are like heyy, how are ya? and we just were like RUN haha it was kinda funny then there was this like Indian guy in an Abercrombie "39" shirt and the guy was like check out the guy in the 39, 39, 39 and he just kept yelling, thinkin' he was drunk lol but it was funny. So i had a fun time and now lexie is over here because she's hot and we shower together, even tho dan might not believe it! it's fun too!! haha I think i decided to stay here because like we all know, im in love with dan, yay for that, im a loser...anyway, im off until something exciting happens, call the cell!! hahah you love me!   Much Love,  *Spearly* and lexie too i supposed ;-)  P.S.  Never run from the things that make you happy, always go toward them and keep them close to your heart forever...   I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were here.   The world's a roller coaster and I am not strapped in. Maybe I should hold with care, but my hands are busy in the air.

Here (hands him condoms) keep the change, *he comes home the next morning* have any change? NOPE:-) haha good job bradin! way to have sex lol, awesome show, anyway, then lexie and i went outside and played ping pong, did i mention that we hit that stupid little ball 141 times in a row, our original goal was 20 then it somehow escalated to 100 and did i also mention that the first time we were near 100 (97) I screwed it up so we had to start at zero?! yeah, it was awesome...we also talked about so many other things, we can talk about anything, i love lexie so much, and she's hott too, just an added bonus i guess! hahaha i have that with some guys also so it's a great life! lol I finally fell asleep at 5a.m. Lexie had to babysit today so when Colleen came over, we went out for brunch at Chesapeake Bagel then downtown to Arts*Fest haha it was great we just walked around for a few hours, got a little burnt, saw the Johnson Brothers, saw J. Brendan, i love her! wish kel was back home!! Then i blew off the guy i love for no reason at all and he hates me so i don't know what to do, i don't even know why i did it and i wish i wouldn't have so we could've hung out but no, i'm an idiot...great life, aint it!!! wow, i suck at everything but im just to the point where i dont know what to do and lexie was going to tell him something but im not sure what and im afraid for her to tell him because i know the general idea of what she wants to say...anyway, then we went to my little brothers baseball game, they won so they've got a game now on friday against American and if they win, they play American again on saturday, if not All-Stars is over so i guess it's good that baseball might be over because i'm getting bored of it, then again if they win here then they get to travel which is always fun in the motels with hot boys and i wanna take lexie with me, it'll be awesome so kind of having mixed feelings, then again, it doesn't really matter! lol im such a loser but hey, you guys already knew that so don't worry! lol well i've gotta go clean my room and put my cellular phone to good use, call it sometime! haha love you guys!  Love Always,  *Spearly*  P.S. Never blow anything off that means the whole world to you, always let people know how you feel, live in the moment...    How do I, Get through one night without you? If I had to live without you, What kind of life would that be? I need you in my arms, need you to hold, You're my world, my heart, my soul, If you ever leave, Baby you would take away everything good in my life, And tell me now How do I live without you? I want to know, How do I breathe without you? If you ever go, How do I ever, ever survive? How do I, how do I, oh how do I live? Without you

      So you know how i told you i would write if anything exciting happened...well, for once in my neighborhood, something was exciting...so dad and i are standing outside on the deck making steaks for dinner (*yummy!*) and Blu and Sandy (my doggies of course) started to bark so we figured they were just barking at each other then Blu runs out to our fruit trees and starts to bark but then comes back on the deck and i see that the hair on her back is standing up, i yell at her and she settles down but in 3 minutes, she is back out at the trees and then dad and i see something black/brown, not quite sure because it was kinda dark out and we figure it's Blu since she is black (yeah, doesn't make much sense does it?!?, my sisters dog! lol) anyway, it ends up being a   Bear   and Blu chased it up into the trees behind my house so yes, that was my exciting event for today, there was a bear in my backyard and it was just a little one, actually probably about 75 pounds but i figure hey, there are bigger bears out there! so anyway, it was fun, i wish it would've stayed in the yard longer because bears are cool but Blu chased it away, did i ever mention, i don't like that dog very much! lol anyway, earlier today all i did was hang out with some of my boys, none of them which you know since they aren't from Pennsylvania but hey, it's okay, i also played about 3 or 4 hours of basketball, my idea of a good day, fun things, work, and exciting event...anyway, im gunna go now because there is a phone and a bed that await me...sounds kinda dirty, then again, i like that stuff hahahahaha but it's okay i love you all have a great night!!!  Lexie, i love you!  Kelly, i miss you, hope you're gettin' better, i love you much!! Much Love,  *Spearly*  P.S. Never take anything for granted, especially if it is something that is important to you, you never know what you have until you lose it and once you lose it, you very seldomly get it back...   Fall, with you I fall so fast I can hardly catch my breath I hope it lasts  Ohhhh It seems like I can finally Rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhh It’s as if you know me better Than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

      Yesterday was awesome, it was the fourth of July of course and in the morning, matt, mom and i went out to eat at the waffle shop then we went shopping at wal*mart for stuff for the fireworks! haha Of course, matt and i acted like idiots but what else is new, matt is an idiot and i just enjoy acting like one to fit in with the rest of my family! lol Matt decided to kick field goals in aisle 7 with his shoe, i was the uprights, people stared lol but it's okay, shh, mom doesn't know! Anyway, when i got home, michelle, patrick, matt and i went to subway and matt and i decided to walk to giant while they got their subs, as we walked by a set of patio furniture outside, matt said damn, it would be hard to steal that, they're all chained together and a little old couple walking by just kind of stared at him then shook their heads.  When we got home, kelly and i talked on the phone for a little bit, she's doing much better, thanks everyone! Then Michelle, Patrick and I watched some classic friends episodes until we had to get ready for the fireworks, my mom had some kind of VIP passes so we got to park like right where they shoot them off, we did get hit by some flying debris but somehow, that excited matt...my whole family was there, well at least from my mom's side plus matt's girlfriend and her family and some of her friends (not that she has many) haha i love you kel!  Anyway, michelle patrick and i walked up to BJC to get some ice cream which cost me $12 and after that, we walked back up to the parking lot to get some French Fries, a Funnel Cake, Lemonade and Orangeade, which cost me another $10 but that's okay!! lol i guess that's the kind of stuff that makes me as fat as i am!!! Anyway, this was probably about the best 4th ever because it was pouring down rain and i got to get soaked while watching such an amazing thing...it's kinda corny but i love to watch fireworks, the colors of them are so beautiful...anyway, only one thing could've made it better but let's not dwell on the bad things because i'm sure you all know what i wanted...:-( But my boys did come visit me and we all layed in the back of my truck in the pouring rain while watching the fireworks, then i got a surprise phone call so it doesn't get much better than that! I had an awesome time, thanks so much to all of you!!! hehe  Lexie, i miss you and i love you, can't wait for you to come home!  But for now, i'm done, i don't think anything exciting is going to happen tonight, i have to go to my little brothers baseball game though so if anyone wants to come, call my cell, otherwise, i will probably write when i get home... Happy Fourth All :-)  Love Always,  *Spearly*  P.S. Be happy with what you have, smile at memories, cry at losses but never the other way around, live your life like it was meant to be lived, don't hold back and always remember to tell the ones you love just how much you love them...   ...and then  I went sky diving  I went Rocky Mountain climbing  I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu  and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter  and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying  and he said someday I hope you get the chance  to live like you were dying.  Like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about  what you'd do with it  what did you do with it  what did I do with it  what would I do with it?

      So I've been bored this summer and i have managed to create two new screen names, a buddy profile and this, by the way, the screen names are xoSummerRainDxo and Earlygirldy05, i'll be on the first one more often, the second one was made by Drew, my most favorite guy ever because he said Summer Rain was a laundry detergent scent, not a screen name and that i needed to have something with my name in it so he made it up for me, that's why i love him, he's awesome!  But today i mostly just hung around the house, first time we've all been home in a really long time and of course, we all acted like idiots but that's what makes us part of the Spearly Clan haha it's great!  Then we went out for dinner, we were going to go to Jim's but then it was closed so we ended up at Bonfattos, a great place to act like idiots and have tons of fun! lol  We re-lived a lot of friends scene like the classic, joeys bag...{Joey and Rachel are in Ralph Lauren} Joey & Rachel @ Ralph Lauren J: Wow, that's amazing how a womans purse could look so good on me, a man... R: Yeah, see Joey, unisex J: Maybe you need sex, i had sex the other day R: No joey U-N-I sex J: Well, can't say no to that! THAT IS AWESOME! I LOVE FRIENDS, wish i had them actually! haha  Anyway, when i got home from dinner, i played about 2 or 3 hours of basketball and thought about a lot of things, i was actually on tonight so it was a good time...now im sitting around, talking to people, listening to music and writing this which is now getting bored so im going to leave you! Happy 4th of July, call me about the fireworks, i love you all, lexie i miss you!   Much Love, *Spearly*  P.S. Marie, you're in all of our prayers, love you always and forever, I'm here for ya if you need me! much love     Cowboy take me away Fly this girl as high as you can Into the wild blue Set me free oh I pray Closer to heaven above and Closer to you closer to you...

      Okay well, i don't know how many of you already knew about my moving but really early this morning, i decided that i wasn't going to move, it took a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, and a lot of walking, and a little bit of talking with the people that i trust and love the most but i finally decided that what i want and what i need is here and even if i can't have everything i want/need right away, being here and having a chance at it is better than being 100+ miles away from it, i don't know if any of you even know the reason i was going to move but it was stupid because i was running away from something that i should never ever run away from or even try to for that matter because i was trying to run away from something that i love and that i can't get enough of...anyway, i don't want to bore you all with that, just thank the people that helped me through all of this and gave me their wonderful advice, and even those of you who wouldn't help me at all and told me that it was my own decision, one that i needed to make by myself, you helped me the most, i love you, thank you so much.  Late night phone calls are awesome, thanks to those of you who made them... Lexie, i'll miss you but when you get back, we are hanging out or something! i love you so much! have fun and bring me back something nice!!! Nothing happened today that was exciting, i played 3 hours of basketball and cleaned the house, yay!...at least it's a way of making money tho! haha gotta love it! I'm out for tonight because it's been a long day and i didn't get any sleep at all last night, im going to try to get some tonight when i get back from my walk, i love you all! 4th of July, Sunday, Call my Cell and we'll meet up to watch the fireworks!!  Love Always,  *Spearly*  P.S. Isn't it amazing how one person can say so little, maybe even nothing yet tell you so much?...Just think about that and know, actions speak louder than words and sometimes, not giving any advice is giving the best advice in the world...i love you...   *It's true, the way I feel Was promised by your face The sound of your voice Painted on my memories Even if you're not with me I'm with you*

      Nothing exciting happened today, at all...i was really really sick, like the kinda sick where you can't even move without something hurting but im getting better now so it's ok.  Today two of my really good friends talked me out of moving away and im sure i wont regret it, i just need to give it time, there are a lot of people here that i love  wayy  too much to leave...aka  LEXIE  and of course there are some others but especially lexie.   Anyway, today I just watched a lot of TV and slept, i would try to make it sound exciting but there is just no way to do that.   To my friends - i love you guys more than anything!    Much Love,  *Spearly*   P.S. Call about the 4th... ;-)   Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby

      Wow, so i haven't written anything in here in like forever...i'm not even too sure what i wrote about lsat time i did write so anyway...3 weeks ago, i went to basketball camp all week, not to participate but to help out that was not bad at all, i hung out with evans, the most awesome person ever! and i met and became friends with alli mock aka the mockster..lol dont ask...but i had that mon-fri and friday i left to go to my grandparents, i just got back last night at 9... Alli slept over at my house on thursday, it was awesome...i wonder if 4 A.M. means anything to her...like maybe bedtime...specially when we have to get up at 7 lol Anyway, my grandparents was awesome and i can't wait to go back...i met so many awesome people there...especially danny...i miss you babe!!!! We did so much stuff i wouldn't have done if i was here in state so it was awesome...plus, i got to see my favorite uncle and favorite cousin...my uncle is so awesome...43 years old and he still acts like he's about 5...and that's when he ISN'T drunk...haha it was awesome but i love him...my little 5 year-old cousin is awesome too, his name is kyle and he is soo cute...he talked to lexie on the phone while i was there and it was adorable...when he gets off he says, "danielle, lexie is my new girlfriend, i like her a lot." Anyway, i pretty much just hung out, i went out about every night so it was tons of fun...then this past saturday, i babysat kyle while my uncle and aunt went to a wedding...5 hours, 40 bucks...but really, i didn't make anything because earlier that day, before i started to babysit, i went to buy candy and i spent $41.80 so i almost broke even hahaha gotta love life... Sunday morning, i packed all my stuff up and my uncle, aunt, cousin, grandparents and i headed for Knoebels to meet the rest of my family at 12...we hung out there for the day, ate dinner together at like 5 then went on a few more rides, (i got the Brass Ring :-D) then we headed home, it was so much fun, but it was sad to say goodbye because i love my uncle and my cousin so much (my grandparents n aunt too, just not as much! lol) and i miss them but i get to go back in a week so it'll be fine!! plus, i miss danny! but i also missed lexie while i was gone so i'll get to hang out with her and tell her all about it before i go back!! Now i'm just sittin here listenin to music and typing up all this crap haha it's great! but i have to unpack and re-pack so if you want to know any of my stories about hott hott guys and fun times...give me a call!! Love Always, *Spearly*  P.S. Never let your dreams slip away, tell the people you care about the most just how much you care about them, don't hold anything back, be the leader, not the follower, smile, laugh, love...   I won't talk   I won't breathe   I won't move till you finally see   That you belong with me You might think   I don't look   But deep inside in the corner of my mind   I'm attached to you I'm weak   It's true   Cause I'm afraid to know the answer   Do you want me too?   Cause my heart keeps falling faster I've waited all my life   To cross this line   To the only thing that's true   So I will not hide   It's time to try anything to be with you
