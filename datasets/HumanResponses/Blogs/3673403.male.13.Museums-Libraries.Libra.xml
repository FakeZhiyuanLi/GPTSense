      Well, after a minor break, I've returned. And I still have no readers.  But anyways, on to business. Instead of the usual complaints, I'll tell you a funny story. A magical tale that will make you lose all hope in the children, and the "future" they'll soon be, not to mention humanity as a whole. My grade(rising ninth graders)'s "hottest" couple broke up tonight. Why did the two teens who seemed to have been made for each other break up? Because the guy went over to a friend's house, signed on AIM and left his password saved. So what does this friend's friend/my brother do? Sign on and have a little talk with the other half of the relationship. My brother then breaks up with the girl, allowing my friend to call up this girl and ask her out. And they're going out on a date tomorrow. No names were mentioned as to save my skin and the skin of the other two people involved. Remember, I'm Guy McAwesome, not (real name omitted).

      Okay, so you wear some really tight, skimpy speedo, jump off a block and into a pool and swim down to the other end. Then you swim back. And end right where you started. Why bother? What's the point? What've you accomplished? You've wasted some energy, but at the end of the day you realize you've gone NOWHERE. Even if you only swim DOWN, and not BACK to where you started, it would've been easier to just walk to the other side. Maybe I just feel this way because I SUCK so bad at swimming.  Now that I'm done with that, I want to ask you a favor. Visit: http://www.capalert.com. Find the movie analyses and read a few. They're pretty funny. In case you didn't feel like visiting it, it's basically some extremely conservative Christian nit-picking about recent movies and telling extremely conservative Christian parents why they shouldn't let their kids see movies. Anyone else not remember a lava-death in Lilo and Stitch? Or Satanic symbols in the Recess movie? I don't, but maybe I'm not looking hard enough.

      Wow it's my very first blog. Isn't that special. It's 2:30 a.m. and frankly, I don't feel like complaining about anything currently. But, I'll think up something anyways... MY OLDER BROTHER. Dude, he is really annoying. He finds something wrong with everything I say or do. He also seems to be a bit bipolar. One minute he's saying "fag" or "retard" 200 times in one sentence, and then the next thing you know, he's acting politically correct. "Oh, everyone is free to have their own opinion and just 'do their thing'... You're stupid. Why do you like Weird Al? That makes you DUMB! You're a nerd." Stupid jock... always raining on my parade. Well this is "Guy"... leaving, but not going to bed (and they say teenagers need sleep...). Bye.

      Man, have we got white trash neighbors or what? They had a broken down limo parked infront of their house for about a week. It disapeared for a while, and now it's back again. Keep in mind that I live in a rich snob neighborhood. But it's all good. One of our cats was sleeping on the limo, and the other pissed on it. These rednecks have a couch and T.V. in their garage that get used often. Why is this a problem, you ask? They open the garage door whilst doing this, and drink beer. Alot of it. Their teenage son, too. He got kicked out of high school. A public one. It takes a good bit of effort to get kicked out of public school. But brawling with a teacher apparently does the trick. This kid also walks around wearin g camoflauge and shooting things with a paintball gun. The police get called pretty often because of the parents' constant fighting. Drunken fighting. and this was supposed to be the best street to live on. Pffft. Yeah, right.  Ever been to urlLink   Making Fiends  ? It's about these second graders. One is like the daughter of Satan and is constantly trying to do in this other girl, who is totally oblivious to everything going on. It's great.

        Lately, I've had alot of alone time, which I've spent thinking. What was I thinking about? The fact that I will never have a girlfriend. But I'm cool with that. Infact, screw the ladies. They don't deserve me. If they can't see just how sexy I am, too bad for them. I'll be a bachelor forever. I can come home after work and just hang out when I'm an adult. I'd be a shitty dad anyways.  When I went to Blockbuster today, I forgot my collection of shitty movies to trade in. But I guess I'll try to remember them next time. My dad, brother and I spent 30 more minutes at Blockbuster than we should have, all thanks to someone under 5 feet tall at my house (not my mom, one of my sisters, but neither will admit to it) had Chasing Liberty out for over a month. Despite the bill in excess of $30, it works out great as a victory for me. Neither of my sisters is allowed to rent a movie ever again. And The Usual Suspects is a great movie. HellBoy was good, too.   If you have an extra five bucks lying around, rent HellBoy and watch the introduction on Disc 1. Is that guy fat or what? Henceforth, I won't use the word 'fat' to describe overweight people. I will use 'Guillermo' or 'Guillermo del Toro' for short. For shizzle .

       Wow, another member. Awesome. Well, in other news(yes, I've already gotten over my newest reader, Alec), I dumped the ever-shitty Internet Explorer and now use Mozilla instead. Hoorai. Not hooray. Something this momentus calls for a Japanese celebration. Mo has fixed all the damage my sisters did to my computer. I haven't seen a single pop-up since I got it. Anyways, Summer is almost over. Damn. Where's the Dammit Doll* when you need it? Well, my dad is going to take me to Blockbuster tonight and we're gonna rent Hellboy. I might buy The Last Samurai, too (one of the few films I saw twice in theaters, almost three times). I won't buy Kill Bill till the second one comes out because they might make some collector's edition with the movies combined into one.  *The Dammit Doll is a doll my grandmother had when I was little. When you were angry, you'd pick up the Dammit Doll and hit stuff with it and shout "DAMMIT!" at the top of your lungs. My brother and I would take it and hit each other shouting "Dammit!" for hours and laugh hysterically. I was about 5 and he was 7.

       My best firend is moving. That sucks. So much for our plans to time travel with George Carlin in a phone booth. Or go to New York on an overgrown peach. Peaches suck anyways. But that would still kick ass. I realize that I just posted one hour or so ago, but I felt like posting again.    I've decided on my future career. Everyone in my family thinks I'll be a comedian, or actor, or even writer for movies or t.V. shows. But, just so I can give them what's for, I'll be an accountant. Huttzah! I win!   Or I could open a museum of the paranormal. Like the copy of Scary Movie 3 I obtained from Blockbuster... that was fullscreen! It was marked as widescreen, but it was full screen. Bizarre. Or... paranormal?

       So, last night, I was channel surfing, trying to find something good on. I passed by UPN. They were airing the series premiere of Amish in the City. I decided to watch. It was like that time that herd of squirrels ripped out my eyes to feed their young. Like the title of this post says, the 'Amish' people weren't very convincing. Come on, guys, they know about our technology, just choose not to use it. And, of course, to&nbsp; add to the 'drama', they threw in some city folk(a couple of gay guys hitting on each other, an&nbsp;ugly&nbsp;vegetarian who eats no dairy or eggs either, and this loud black chick) and essentially ruined the show. But fortunately, Family Guy is now on TBS at 8:00. At least on Wednesdays. And my cousin is gone.   Right now listening to Combat Baby by Metric. It's pretty good. and I'm still not a goth.    &nbsp;  But watch this movie&nbsp;trailer. I had heard rumors of this film being made, but I didn't believe it. I hope the DVD comes out by my birthday next year!  urlLink http://trimeg.bayair.net/trailer.asp

         PLEASE NOTE: THERE IS MORE THAN JUST THIS LIST OF MOVIES. ACTUAL CONTENT BELOW!           &nbsp;     I  collect DVD's for fun. It truly is. I'm currently nearing the 50 DVD's mark, and when I do, I'll go out and buy some more movies. Currently, I've got:     Dr. No    From Russia With Love    Goldfinger    Thunderball    You Only Live Twice    On Her Majesty's Secret Service    Diamonds are Forever    Live And Let Die    The Man With The Golden Gun    Monty Python and the Holy Grail('temporarily' being borrowed by Jeff...SINCE EARLY MAY)    The Spy Who Loved Me    Moonraker    For Your Eyes Only    Stripes    Octopussy(fun to say)    The Terminator    A Nightmare On Elm Street    A View To A Kill    The Living Daylights    Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure    Licence To Kill    UHF    Patriot Games    Goldeneye    Tommy Boy    tomorrow Never Dies    Austin Powers:The Spy Who Shagged Me    The World Is Not Enough    X-Men 1.5    28 Days Later    Die Another Day    Goldmember    Ice Age    Lilo&Stitch(not really mine)    Minority Report    Mr. Deeds    Panic Room    Spiderman    Bruce Almighty    Dickie Roberts:Former Child Star    Freddy Versus Jason    The Matrix Revolutions(planning on exchanging it)    Tomb Raider:The Cradle of Life(same)    The Italian Job    Chappelle's Show Season 1    X2    Scary Movie 3     &nbsp;   Movies I hope to get:    Dawn Of The Dead(the new one)    Mortal Kombat    Ferris Bueller's Day Off    Back To The Future 1,2,&3    T3: Rise of the Machines    Sixteen Candles    The Faculty    maybe Jimmy Neutron(it was pretty good for a Nickelodeon movie)     &nbsp;    &nbsp;   So.... Now on to the part you may potentially care about:    I've spent the past two weeks out of town "hanging out" with my cousin. He is about 2 1/2 years younger than me. We used to be very similar in tastes, but now that I'm almost 14, we don't have the same interests. He doesn't seem to notice. He follows me around and I just can't shake him off. He only watches SpongeBob. I watch VH1 religiously(ded I spel tat riet? gud). The worst part is, I've got another week with him. I can't do any of the things I like. AAAAARRRRRGgHHHH. He's driving me nuts. Please help. I can't stand to hear him repeat something blatantly obvious again. Or hearing him assume that all I ever think about is James Bond. Am I really that one dimensional? &nbsp;

      I was recently listening to my favorite song, which NONE of you have ever heard, called "Electric Barbarella" by Duran Duran, when I began to wonder; is it about a guy who buys a robot, or a guy who buys a blow-up doll? I mean, it could go either way. I was also wondering, should it be removed from the "Songs about Robots" playlist, which includes Mr.Roboto, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, and Machinehead? Voice your opinions in a comment. No, wait, don't. Your opinion means nothing. That means you too, poser.   Now visit this website, dammit: http://www.maddox.xmission.com . Did you? I'm waiting. I can wait here all day; I'm in no hurry.

           I'll admit it. I'm a hermit.       I prefer being alone in my room. But no one else seems to like my being a hermit. My siblings and their friends(whom are children of the devil, very loud, and have begun multiplying) are constantly coming in my room and trying to get on my computer. This wouldn't be a problem were it not for 2 things; (1) The lock on my door can be unlucked from the other side(what genius came up with that idea?) and (2) my room is connected to my brother's room by a bathroom, and I can't lock him out of a bathroom that's half his. That reminds me. The PS2 is half mine. I don't really want to play it, but I don't want you to play it either.

           Currently listening to "So Far So Good" by Thornley. It's a decent song. Besides, it was free. iTunes is awesome.              Anyways, there's really nothing to write about. Except, of course, for my orthodontist, the Spawn of Satan. My teeth are fine, dipshat. Noone will notice all of those tiny gaps. And if you make me wear those rubberbands on my braces again, I'll bite your effing hand off and feed it to my dog. Go choke on a hot dog. Bastard. I'll pry my braces off with some pliers if it means my parents never have to put cash in your pockets again.

          Well last night, my brother and friend(from the post before this) and I watched Eurotrip. It was a great movie. I suggest renting it. But do your self a favor and get the rated version if you're not into seeing fat old guys' packages. After that, we went outside(it was about 12:15). But I decided to follow my gut instinct, as I had heard what happened last time they went outside after midnight, and believe me, I have ZERO interest in shiting on a picnic table. So I tell them I want to go home and go to bed. After seeing so many episodes of The Cosby Show, Saved By The Bell, and Full House where people are rewarded for using good judgement, I expected them to be cool with that. I mean, I'm a really uptight guy, and it would seem normal for an uptight guy to be worried about lighting things on fire and drinking out of non-alcoholic beer cans on a country club golf course at 12:30 am. But no, that makes me a giiiirl. I mean, I actually plan on having a future, and the last thing I need is to be dropped off by the police at m,y house after midnight when I'm supposed to be sleeping over at a friends house.     So at about 1, I finally go home. But the front door is locked, and I don't want to wake up my mom and sisters with the garage door. Fortunately, the basement door was open and I didn't have to return to my brother and face more ridicule. Great friends, eh?     So, how's about visiting a web site for me? Go to http://www.homestarrunner.com . Man, it's hilarious. Goddnight.

      The other night, I won a prize off of the cap from a Sprite bottle. The prize? A free Blockbuster Favorites rental. After I got a haircut today, my mom and I were waiting for the pizza we ordered(to go), and I "coincidentally" had the cap. We decided to go into Shlockbuster and get a movie. I knew that the number of "Favorites" movies wasn't huge, but I expected at least a  few . My mom and I looked for 45 minutes. And didn't find a single one. What a great prize. Thanks, you corporate bastards. Be aware of the large packages you'll be recieving in the mail soon. They contain bear traps.* What kind of contest has no prizes? Not a good one, I'll tell you that.   *Please note that that was me being ficticious. I don't have any bear traps.

      Ever since we moved into our new house, my sisters have been behaving  differently .  Their new friends have quite radical attitudes and behavior. One of my sisters has started  mouthing off  to my mom. She's 10. She NEVER had an attitude before meeting these kids. They now show ZERO respect for anyone else's property, and waste stuff off the wazoo(What a great word. Wazoo!). They're always leaving food all over the place along with dishes and wrappers(Not like Jay-Z or Snoop Doggy McDogDog, you twat.) Well, today, when my mom was out and I was watching my sisters after they got back form school, they brought the ring leader of their friends over. I figured that since I technically was in charge, I'd say they weren't allowed to have friends over until mom got back. They fought and fought and finally just ended the conversation and kept the friend over. Well, a perfect opportunity came up to make her leave when she began to use words my sisters really didn't need to know(I don't care how liberal a person you are, no nine and ten year olds should know what humping is). I told her to shape up  or leave. Know what she said  back to me? "You're not the boss of me. You can't tell me what to do!" I was all, "You bet your ass I'm the boss of you when you're at MY house, BITCH!" Well, I didn't REALLY say that, but I would have. But I told since I was babysitting, my words were law. And my words were Quit saying 'hump'. Know what she did? She started chanting "Hump, hump, hump, hump!" It seemed like the fact that I was the master of this domain had no effect on her. I reminded her  again  of this, and she said that if she called up her mom and asked her whom was incharge of her when at my house, her mom would say 'Sarah(the friend, in case you were confused)'. Ooooh, man that pissed me off. We some how later got to the subject of my DVD's. They made fun of Eurotrip. Big mistake. I was all "That's a classic movie beeotch, and when you turn 18, you're watching it." They wanted to know why I had seen it when I was only 13, and they couldn't see it until they were 18(Oh, so now they  want  to watch Eurotrip, eh?). I explained to them that the movie was unrated. That wise-ass friend of their's whiped out her fresh attitude and asked "Do you like iut because it has boobies in it?" I replied by saying(yes, I know this was a little out of hand) that that's what boys liked to watch. She got offended and whipped out her "You dirty pig!" attitude. Feminazi.  My sister's in for a nasty suprise when her friend's feminism turns into lesbianism and finds out that that bra burner(And believe me, you don't want to see her in anything more revealing than an eskimo suit.)  just wants to get in bed with her. But I never said that.

      Saw this at one of the forums I frequent.   urlLink The Squirrel Name Generator . I'm Lieutenant McBush. One of my friends and I are planning to go see Harold and Kumar this weekend, but I don't know if that will work out. If it does, we're gonna go buy the Eurotrip soundtrack afterwards, cause it's awesome. Scotty doesn't know, Scotty doesn't know.... Sorry. Anyways, school is starting very soon,  and school is gonna suck the big one. Even more than usual. But hey, maybe I'll get Kill Bill Vol. 2 on DVD and everything will be ALL better. Nah, it wouldn't be all better until I got Dawn of the Dead on DVD this October. Then everything would be JUST  PEACHY.     urlLink  Whadda Ya Know, Haddi-Man?

      But he doesn't always think about what will happen because of his decisions.  Today, I learned that he agreed to be a "parent" for one of the boarding students at the private school. Basically, every once in a while, this boy or girl(I'm assuming it's a boy, but I could be wrong) will visit our house for the weekend. My parents will come to any games he plays in at school. Make him cookies every once in a while. Make him feel at home. What's the problem, you might ask? We live 60 miles from the school. My parents can barely make it to all of my chorus concerts(don't ask) and my brother and I's games. But now, they'll be adding another kid to this list. For four years. So in about two years, my folks will have to attend FIVE DIFFERENT KIDS' CONCERTS, GAMES, RECITALS, WHATEVER. SORRY ABOUT THE CAPS. Anyways, I'm well aware that my dad was just trying to do the right thing, but he obviously didn't look into this whole "Rome parent" thing before signing up for it.  Be prepared for a huge culture clash.  But it will be somewhat interesting. I've never met an Islamic person before. Maybe it won't be all that bad. I just hope the guy's nice. And that I don't say anything insensitive.

      Okay... so the continuing battle between robots and pirates rages on as the astronauts search for the key that will switch off the robots. Meanwhile, in Sweden, a bad-ass black woman walks around killing Communists in cahoots with old people plotting world domination via a giant laser that shoots laser-fied posion from outer space. Every time she kills one of her foes, she loudly exclaims "Kaboom, bitch!" But the communists have another weapon: the evil videotape that whenever you watch it, you turn into Rosie O'Donnell. But seeing as no one watches videos anymore, only DVD's, the plan to amass an army of obese lesbian women has failed. Meanwhile, Adam Sandler falls in love with a girl from Japan named Cookie, who turns out to be a deranged transvestite from Bulgaria on a mission to kill the bad-ass black woman in Sweden, who has the key to stopping the robots. Hilarity ensues. Sandler dies. The pirates win. The bad-ass black woman kills the deranged Bulgarian transvestite, but doesn't say "Kaboom, bitch!", which means the curse has been broken. But first, she must return the key to the mystical Temple of Bad Shit in Egypt so the Robots never return. But on her way there, she meets up with Rob Schneider, who has been transformed into a vial containing a rare disease that will make all of the worlds water supply turn into a liquid worse than any poison; Diet Coke with Lemon. The Commies and Geezers want their hands on the disease but  a male Lebanese vetrinarian who also happens to be a world-class chef  tags along to provide his assistance with the task of slaying Kathie Lee Gifford...

      Eurotrip is kick ass. That movie is even funnier the third time around. I bought it on DVD, along with the first Kill Bill and Ferris Bueller. All of those movies are classic.  Okay, I'd like to apologize for something... Yes. I know the goth song sucks. but doesn't it honestly look like one-hit-wonder material? I mean, it's one of those songs that people go out and buy the CD for after hearing it on the radio, the they listen to the CD, and they're all, "Dude, this CD sucks."  If each CD costs $15, I'd be rich. Especially if I produced and did all that other good stuff.  Recently I've gotten a new-found respect for Moby. And techno/electronic music in general. iTunes has 72 streaming electronic radio stations. Absolutely free. Does that not kick ass? It does.  Now visit  urlLink this  website. That's just awesome. It blew me away when I first saw it. I'm still recovering after that first time I saw it and I was launched away from my computer and my head went through the T.V. The explosion could be seen for miles. Of course that's false. The explosion could only be seen for one mile.  I'd like to vent about something. What is that thing? Wasting summer. Adults seem to have forgotten what summer was like as children. I know we kids are annoying as hell, but that doesn't mean that they can just flush our vacations down the toilet. I don't want to read over the summer. I don't want to write a paper over the summer. I don't want to paint the Sunday School room over the summer (I would have if they had used my idea. It was  a serious one. Basically, everyone who showed up would get their own section to paint. The could paint whatever they wanted that would represent what they like. But no, that was rejected by someone who wanted to paint the room te most obnoxious color ever.) Do parents not remember what it was like to not have to think about math and history for 3 months? The best three months out of the year, when you can just do whatever? When the man isn't deciding what you have to do? Thanks, adults, for taking away yet another thing kids look forward to. What's next- educational T.V.(Oh, wait a tick...)?

      Visit  urlLink this site  or I'll... do... something... not good. Now, after visiting that site, you must begin preparing for international "Talk Like A Pirate Day". And if you've got a website, link to that website soall your readers will see it.  Everyone has to know about Talk Like A Pirate Day.  You know what sucks more than having to go back to school in one week? Wasting my last Saturday of summer at orientation. That's the shit, man. I don't care what anyone say, high school's gonna suck the big one. Like, it'll suck more than regular school. And regular school sucks alot.  Is  urlLink this not awesome?  If you said no, you're wrong. Because it is.   urlLink This  is a good website. See if you can find my posts. You won't, but try anyways. Also try their  urlLink sister/brother/whatever  site. It's cool.

      Well, that sucks. But I did find two old, great CD's of mine: Running With Scissors by Weird Al and The Very best Of Dr. Demento. They're both awesome. I've never been able to find Dr. Demento's radio show. I know it's on late at night, an on an AM station, but I can never find it. Anyone know where I can find it?    Oh, and in case you were worried, I didn't really set my face on fire. But I did put my leg on the open grill. It felt awesome. seriously though, I don't condone masochism or however it's spelled. Remember kids, never take your anger out on your body. Take it out on someone else's. ZIIIING!

      According to  urlLink the IMDb;  the Paris Hilton Sex Tape's real name is "One Night in Paris" and only got a 4.9 out of 10. The only movies that are allowed to get a score that low are horror movie sequels, Steven Segal movie, and Jean-Claude Van Damme movies. I just thought it was funny that people wouldn't stop talking about this for a while and paid big bucks to see it, only to realize it sucks.   OK guys. I've got a question. If I posted the address of my orthodontist, would you mail him an anonymous package containing a pile of dog shit for me? Because that would be freakin' awesome. OK bye.
