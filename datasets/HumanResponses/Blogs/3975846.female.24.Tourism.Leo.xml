       Wow, what a day  &nbsp;  I knew it was going to be long - Mum had her first round of Oral surgery today - entire bottom arch of teeth was removed!!! All was able to be done under local after all, so apart from some hillarious facials post surgery, she seems to be doing okay - hasn't put her off from eating, which is my main relief. Looks like it's going to be a long haul, but in the end, one very positive result - a happy, confident, healthy looking SMILING mother. FINALLY :D Will do such wonders for her.  &nbsp;  She got very down this morning before we headed into town, purely because (justifiably so) she feels that at her age she should have a larger support system at a time like this. I couldn't do alot to comfort her on this one, basically because I have been feeling the strain with the lack of Whanau down here over the past few weeks, a hard factor to face really. I know I'm doing the best&nbsp;I can for her, but I wish there was someone to share the pain for her and I. But that's okay. To top things off, baby spent the day with Steve (my stepfather, though he and Mum and seperated), so of course Mum and I headed back to his house to retrieve Oh Hypo One, and the instant we walked in the door (picture a bleeding, woozy, shaky, frail Mum), Steve -launched- into Mum. I felt terrible, A: He did this in front of my son, and B: Mum had just confronted a huge fear of hers, and had a rather invansive procedure!! I slipped out the door with baby and left them to it, though keeping an ear out to make sure he wasn't going to be doing anything physically harmful for Mum. She was devestated, and quite rightly so!! She couldn't speak to defend herself either. So we headed home pretty quick smart, though things seemed to be settled between Mum and Steve (J calls him Grumpy for future reference).  &nbsp;  Anyways. Mum ate, and the feeling has returned to her face (woohoo :D ), and went to bed, in rather light spirits all things considering, and J's Dad came over and spent a few hours here, which was nice - everything was relaxed, and we all had a nice evening. Though, his gf rang at one point, and asked what he was doing, and he replied "Nothing, still out at Mum and Dad's", which riled (only for an instant), because I don't think he should have to lie about spending time with J. But I know she sees me as a threat, I just hope that passes.  &nbsp;  I got a phone call (Yay good bit) about an hour ago, from Uncle Charles, Mum's older bro. He rang to see how Mum and I are doing - they live in Hammies - And just to get an update. He and Mum have had their difference over the years, but he has been a great support over the last few weeks, a blessing even. Now he told me a secwet - he's COMING DOWN ON SATURDAY!!! He feels that I deserve the support, and despite his mixed feelings about mother dearest, she's his sister, and she's ill, so he wants to see her. He's coming down for one night, but OH so yay. Very emotional for me (though haven't cried :P ), because I have felt isolated and rather alone - the Mum thing compounding things somewhat, and this makes it all better. Love it. I feel like crying now just thinking about it! :D :D :D How COOL IS THAT!! :D  &nbsp;  Right, I've made my bed, its all warm and snuggly, and I wanna talk to Chwis before I head off, &nbsp;so I shall go.  &nbsp;  *warm fuzzies*  &nbsp;  Today's Quote:     &nbsp;    The only kind of dignity which is genuine is that which is not diminished by the indifference of of others. - Dag Hammarskjold.

       First ever Blog!!!! *trembles with excitement*     &nbsp;   Well where do I start? Hrrmmm - here will do! :D     &nbsp;   Weather: Fine, crisp day - slight breeze blowing, but a lovely change from the kaka that we had over the weekend! Always tend to lift my spirits, and motivate me to get going with the housework. Everything is achieved on that front, and J is having a nap, as is mother dearest, so the peace and quiet is wonderful.     &nbsp;   I keep having this dream reeling around in my head from last night. Quite disturbing, yet kind of comforting in a nearly erotic way. Sounds grubby, I know, but -who- was in it was the thing that disturbs me. Dan, my oldest male friend down here, perhaps ever actually. And the dream was pretty blatant - me &amp; him taking our friendship ALOT further than we ever have, and ever will for that matter. And it is completely out of character for me to even have dreams that A: I remember, and B: with an erotic nature. In fact this is the first one that I remember!     A couple of my friends have commented on how close Dan and I are, and that's fine - most people do. I admit, we -are- close, and we're going to stay that way. But recently people have insinuated that we act more couple like. I haven't noticed it - sure anyone who doesn't know us would jump to the conclusion that we are an item, for the sheer fact that if we get the chance to see each other, we hug and kiss, and manage to find ourselves in deep conversation about everything, nothing and all in between. I love him, he loves me - but anything beyond what we have now would be suicide for us. Perhaps initially fun, but after that, downhill spiral, pushing shit uphill etc etc etc.&nbsp; We've touched on the topic of a potential "us" over the years, and perhaps come close, though have always reneged on the idea purely because we tend to clash with our emotions more than anything.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   But this DREAM!!! It's gonna bug me - I'm going to tell him in the weekend, he'll find it incredibly funny, he'll piss himself. I don't know, I think the fact that he's been so supportive since Mum landed in hospital is probably what triggered it. He's the only person that I knew would drop everything and give me the hug that I truly -truly- needed the Saturday before last. He's brilliant value, and I rate him as one of my favourite people ever.     &nbsp;   Got a good weekend up ahead of me - heading out with the girls, gonna dance like crazy, and relax. Looking forward to it. Until then, it's appointments with Mum, playing with my darling son, taking him to see Shrek 2 (He'll LOVE it!!) - his first ever movie, and talking to lovely lovely Chris online and repeatedly kicking that butt of his at scrabble (aka Scwabble). Good times, life seems to be panning out a little more smoothly!!     &nbsp;   My quote today:     &nbsp;    My bounty is as deep as the sea,      My love as deep; the more I give to thee,      The more I have, for both are infinite.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        &nbsp;    &nbsp;William Shakespeare.     &nbsp;
