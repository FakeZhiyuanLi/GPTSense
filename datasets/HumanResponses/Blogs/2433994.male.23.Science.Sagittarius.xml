      Yes! This is where I am working for the summer. In the heart of Columbia Valley, Washington. I have just arrived and (of course) instantly hooked up my computer to make my first journal entry of the summer season. Whenever I get the opportunity, I will update this site. If you want to know more about where I will be staying, here are some sites to inform you.   urlLink Richland's site   urlLink Citydata.com  and of course...  urlLink WaWineNews   Don't worry about that last link. I'm here to work and learn first. I want to thank my family, Dan Faiman, Bryan Roberts, Jack, Erica, and Lauren for all the kind words and cards before I left. They mean a lot to me. Many a tear formed during the reading of the cards. Krista, I loved breaking the code!    My plane ride here was long. I had a change over in Detroit, which has a very nice airport by the way, and then in Seattle, before making it down to the Tri-City area. As I said, Detroit's main airport has to be the coolest thing I've seen since wrinkle-free Dockers. Seattle, although I loved the city (for the whole 2 hours I spent there), the airport there wasn't quite as nice. Probably the hardest part of the trip, besides sitting there all day, was the older man sitting next to me on the way to Seattle. I swear, I know more about his life than anyone else. Nice guy though, to bad I wasn't in the mood. I guess that can happen when you get two hours of sleep before a trip like that.    My place is huge. UConn guys, as a reference, take every part of the hilltop apartments and double it in size and add a bathroom for each person. It really is big. Cleaning service, T1 internet and hopefully some rent-a-cars make this a sweet deal. All in all, it should be nice here. To bad I don't know anybody yet. Most people won't be arriving until Tuesday.    OK. There you have it. I will be sending out emails periodically. If you want to reach me here are the many ways....  email: staticfishx@hotmail.com sn: sunamizu cell: 860.301.4126  room: 509.372.6635  Everyone have a good summer.  Ciao

      So this concludes the first week here in Washington and it's Friday night. A bunch of us decided to go out to Atomic Brewery here in Richland. It's quite a place. Everything has weird names relating to the nuclear history here. There's the Plutonium Porter, the Half-life Heiweiser and the list goes on.   I would like to acknowledge Jim Sinatra as the best uncle a guy could have. He is a the best! (He paid me to say that)  It's good to hear from all you. I think I've talked to everyone I know in the past week. Hope everything is good in C state and where ever you may be. I never thought I'd say this, but I kind of miss Connecticut. It really is a nice place to be during the summer. But then again, so is North Carolina ; )

      Link of the day:  urlLink Philadelphia Eagles   OK! So, for my first day of actual lab work.... and my mentor sleeps in. Very nice for me because it was a beautiful day. When she finally got to the site things got underway. Don't ask me what I do here, because I can't tell you. It's good so far. Today I spent some time setting up my office and configuring my D.O.E. computer. It's like a REAL job! The good thing about my mentor is that she "is not a morning person", which means that we don't have to get there until 9:30 if we don't want to. That gives me time to enjoy the important things in the morning like brushing my hair. I met some people that have offices near me in PSL (my building). I finally got my proxy cards, which give me clearence to the facilities. I finished IOPS training. Hmmm, what else today. That was my day. I got back in time to watch the Pistons kick the Lakers.   As for everything else, it is good.  Ciao

      Link of the day:  urlLink John F. Kerry Sucks.com   Man it's been a long day. I had a great time starting my job. I'll tell more tomorrow when I have energy. The people in the CCI group are bonding well. My mentors are awesome. Getting a rent-a-car soon. Things are going to be tight for the next few weeks until I get my first paycheck. In the mean time, please check out my website of the day at the top of this paragraph. It's a funny mud-slinging site directed towards our horrible Democratic candidate.....also, anyone can comment on my posts at the bottom of each one. Alright, off to bed. It's 2:00 EST, if you know what I mean.  Ciao

       urlLink Link of the day:staticfish - Citizen of ACIDplanet.com   Ok. So I have finally had my initial CCI contact at a pizza dinner tonight. Human contact at last! The head of CCI went over some of what we are to expect this summer. The pizza sucked big time. It was like eating communion waffers with not enough sauce. He told us we were a select few. I guess they are very selective with whom they chose for this program. At the end of it all I felt as though I wasn't qualified. He made it sound that good. But I am glad to have things underway tomorrow. I've been here waiting long enough. By being here, each of us will be published. Yes thats right, published. For anyone in the science field, that is HUGE, and quite an honor. A select few from all 9 sites througout the country will be chosen to have their entire thesis published. Last year 9 members from Washington were chosen. If chosen for they will also be paid to attend a national science conference in D.C and present their work to members of Congress. Yes, congress. Pretty freeking cool, huh? So needless to say, there is endless possibilities to what I can take out of this summer, academically, as well as everything else going on here. One of the lab sites was once used to create weapons grade plutonium during the World and Cold Wars.   About my mailing address, I am still unclear (after asking two different people) how it works (it has to be sent to the main office), but I will have that tomorrow.   As for everything else, it is good.  Ciao

       urlLink Link of the day: The real Matt Annecharico   So this is what it's like to not have a car! At least the bus transit system was running today. God forbit you need to get somewhere on Sundays. I charted the distance to the closest bus stop and it's 1.37 miles. I guess things could be worse, but that means shopping is a pain in the butt until I get a car up here. I don't see why the bus company couldn't extend their route another mile for poor souls like me. At least the weather has been nice. I'd say that Monday was a little hotter than the day before... or maybe there was just less wind. It had to be the nicest days I've seen in some time. Just perfect.   It was nice taking the bus through the tri-city area. There actually is quite a bit of civilization south of here. I ended up a the Columbia Mall to do some shopping. There is also a movie theater (YES!) and a bunch else I didn't get time to explore yet. Of course there were plenty of Starbucks and other Expresso joints around. (Starbucks originated in Washington) There all is a ton of elementry schools around. I counted at least 7 yesterday.   Today (Tue. the 7th) is rainy. the average precipitation for the month of June is 0.4 in. I have a gathering to attend tonight at the directors house to meet a bunch of CCI peers. Should be interesting. I hope they aren't boring people. Well, we will just see.    As for everything else, it is good..  Ciao

      My sarcasm never ceases to amuse me.   So today was the second day in lovely Washington. The weather here is very nice and temperate. It got up to the high eighties I would say. But with a light to strong breeze and such a dry atmosphere it is very comfortable at all times. I bet even on the real hot days it's still nice. It is the first time I've been nearly on a desert. Speaking of which, I saw my very own real-life tumbleweed. I was very impressed. I took a nice long 3 hour walk around the area. Everything is so wide open. The landscape is very flat with small mountains scattered about. Each mountain doesn't have any trees on it. The Columbia River is 500 yards or so away. Everything out here is very clean. The river, the roads, the air, its all very clean. I wish I had a digital camera so I could take pictures for all to see, but alas, I do not have one yet. We'll see.... Since PNNL is located on somewhat of the outskirts of town, the closest store is a 7-Eleven about 2 miles or so away, or 45 minutes of walking each way.   I played Frisbee with a couple of other guys on site. We played right in the middle of the desert. Sand, wind and all. It was quite a sight. I dove to make a catch and landed in some sort of tumbleweed, pricker plant. That was fun. It took immense skill to throw the Frisbee in that strong of wind. We really mastered it by the end.  On site here is really surreal. It's like out of the "matrix" or "the Truman show". Every blade of grass is the same height and is green. Every tree is evenly planted and grown to the same height. They must have good landscapers out here. I'm a little too fascinated with the landscaping. It's freaking me out.   Well, that's day two. Tomorrow is Monday, and that means that the bus transit is up and running again. (Closed Sundays) I may take a trip down to Kennawick and do some shopping for stuff I need. We will see. As for everything else, it is good.  Ciao

      Today me and some friends went to a Tri-City Dustdevils minor league baseball game. It is so nice is Pasco. The only way I can describe it is as is the perfect town. Everyone is nice and health looking. The perfect weather, the perfect middle-class families, the wind turbines on the hilly horizon to provide energy. The Colombia river is one of the cleanest rivers in the world. It's just very nice and calm. After baseball, we visited a bunch of people who are living at other apartments elsewhere in the area. Crazy times followed. I'm sure there will be pictures to share soon.  Hanford is an area outside of the tri city area north of where we are. It is desolate and dry out there. That is where the desert is. We drove out there today to see  urlLink LIGO , which is an observatory and HUGE facility for astronomy research. It was kind of boring but part of what we had to do. Tomorrow is Saturday, and that means laying out in the sun finally. It's been very sunny for 9 days or so now. Very nice. As for everything else, it is good.  Ciao

      Helllllllo. Today I took the car our for a spin and explored the valley. It was another perfect day out. It was nice being able to stop by Starbucks on the way to the office. A couple more interns have arrived in my building, one which is pretty cute. I haven't gotten around to introducing myself, but I think I will be very soon....  So I made dinner tonight. It was a success. I have to admit I was kind of nervous being that there wasn't a recipe to go by and I was feeding 10 or so people. It turned out very good. It was olive oil, fresh garlic and some red onion simmering. Then a couple pounds of Roma tomatoes, cut in 8ths with a few fresh basil leaves was all it took. I let that sit on a low temp for 20 minutes. Then I made the pasta and right after I strained it, I threw mozzarella cubes in and let that soften. I then threw the tomato topping and that was it. Quite good I might say so myself. I'm very tired, being a long day so good night.  Ciao   p.s. I'll give anyone ten bucks if they figure out what the title to this post means.

      Drool of the day:  urlLink Oh so good   Today was hot and I was loving every minute of it. I need to get out and lie in the sun before I get ghostly white from working indoors all the time. I got my car today. What a hottie. Ok, so maybe not, but a brand new Kia Rio is not that bad for free. It has 38 miles on it and smells like a new carpet. Gotta love it. Hey so I'm making dinner for a bunch of people tomorrow. I'm making my own recipe up too. Yea, so they all will be guinea pigs. I went grocery shopping today. They don't call it grocery out here. I said that and I got a couple of weird looks. Almost every store I've been in so far, you have to bag all your own groceries. Whoops there I go again with that word. One thing that is great about this place is the price of food. I nearly bought the whole store for 50 bucks. Bell peppers are 30 cents. Lemons? 20 cents. The only thing that wasn't dirt cheap was fresh basil. I have a problem when it comes to grocery shopping. I tend to go overboard and buy enough food to hold me over until Thanksgiving day. So as I sit here in the cool breeze and listen to Chet Baker with George Killian I say adu for now.  Ciao

       Link of the day:  urlLink m a t e o   Can you believe that it's already halfway through June! I can't. Things are starting to pick up here at PNNL. I spent the first half of the day setting up my new computer and stocking my office up with supplies. You all should see how many pens I've scammed from this place already.  So the other day one of the guys living in our suite moved out because his appointment ended. Seth, one of the others here goes, "I'd really wish a girl would move in next". Well, he got his wish. Imagine the look on his face as we were watching some basketball and a 60 (70?) year old woman comes in the front door. We got a laugh out of that. She's only here for 3 nights, but we couldn't help making fun of Seth.   Thanks for all the comments to my posts. I get a kick out of every one of them. I've been monitoring some of the hits this site has gotten and some of you are really liking my site. That's awesome. Krista, Andrew and Jim are sure watching. Rachel S. and Bryan Roberts are competing for the most visits on my AIM profile. All in all, I'm glad you care. As for everything else, it is good.  Ciao Bella!

      Yeeha! First day of lab work. To be blunt, I really didn't like it. It was very tedious and what felt like worthless work. I know what to expect in a biotech lab so this is nothing new. I know the job can sometimes seem very slow, but I really wasn't feeling it day. Well, it's just the first day. I ended up working 9 hours or so. Good day. I got home to late too get my car today, so I guess that'll be tomorrow.  I woke up at 4:45 this morning. very weird considering I am not a morning person. Well, that is a wrap. Over and out.  Ciao  p.s. I love all the comments to my blogs. I'll have to post some of them soon.

      Today was Sunday and what better to do on Sundays, then go to the movies. I started off my summer movies with The Day After Tomorrow. It was really good, but watching the cold weather on the screen and the coldness of the theater was a bit too much. Then it was onto an Italian restaurant where I dazzled the crowds with my knowledge of Italian food. No one here has ever heard of Italian ice. What a crime. There are plenty of fish taco joints here though.   My friend is stationed at the 300 site which is a mile or two from housing. So he had to rent a bike. Oh but this wasn't just an ordinary bike. It was a girls bike with baskets hanging off either side of the back wheel. It's hillarious. I want to take a picture of it so bad. All he needs is a big straw hat and he's straight out of a third world country. what a sight.  It feels like I've been here for so long already. I spent so much time studying the maps of the area and finding out where everthing is here that I feel I know this place more then I should. Even though its only been a week.   I can't wait for North Carolina. It'll be cool being with the whole family. I promise I won't beat up on Andrew too much. As for Krista, I can tell she can't wait either... and Joe, you might want to think of someday doing an internship like this. It really is a great opportunity.

      Ahh, another Saturday here in WA. I'm still waiting for this 'hot" weather they speak of. So, what do the locals do around here? That was my mission for the day. I scoured the land in search of someone who looked like they knew how to have fun. "We go to the movies and hang out", she said. Wow, how original. How cool it must be to be you.   There seems to be a group of us CCI affiliates banding together in times of boredom. So tonight we took a hike and explored the vast area which is Richland. We ended up stuffing our faces with this new delicacy call Smores. Very interesting. Yea, that was the highlight of my saturday. What good times.   They really like their sprinkler systems out here. I've already got caught in a lawn watering fest twice. I guess thats why the grass feels like a plush rug when you walk on it.   That is about it. I'm off to play some basketball.  Ciao

      Today is Friday!! or WAS Friday I should say. Just got in after a late night. The salmon fest was good. Never enough salmon though. I'm thinking of making some on the grill in the next few days. Today we had our weekly CCI meeting as a group to discuss our progress. It was pretty good. I stole the show with my keen incite and cunning wit. It was a little cooler today, I would say in the 90's. I met this fantastic girl who just moved on my floor at work. Very nice...   I ended up having a cheese and fruit lunch with a bunch of quasi-bohemian interns. Tonight I hung out with the black people on site. I'm really diverse with my social skills. I can go from discussion of Cabernet Sauvignon to JET magazine in a heart beat. Oh yes my friends, I am the epidemy of a social chameleon. As a (CCI) group we have a bunch of ideas for weekend travel. We are in the midst of planning a Canada trip. Somewhere in British Columbia, Whistler perhaps. That should be cool.  I was thinking the other day that "Rick" is a good name. I think that I would name my child Rick if I had the chance. I mean, it really isn't a cool name right now, but I don't see having kids for quite a while so maybe when I do, the popularity of that name will once again be acceptable. I feel bad for anyone with that name now. Just a thought.  As for everything else, it is good.  Ciao

      Man, I don't know about my hair. For those of you that don't know, I haven't cut my hair since late February. I've always wanted to grow my hear out and decided to before I got a "real" job. I made a pact to not cut it my entire summer trip. I thought that growing my hair out would be cool. The surfer dude look, not the dirty hippy look. But now we are heading into July and I live on a freaking desert. I don't know. I've been playing basketball every night and you can't even imagine how my hair is after a game. What a hot head. I mean, what happened to the visions of Brandon Boyd, Ashton Kutcher and that guy from Vanilla Sky...Oh yea Tom Cruise. That's what I envisioned, not this mass of follicle regurgitation. Tonight I watched a movie and John Cusak was in it. Without saying more, I think it is obvious that his hair sucked. All I kept thinking was "that's what I'M going to look like?". I don't know anymore. Thank you for listening to my thought of the day. Very self-absorbed thoughts, but thoughts none-the-less. Tomorrow is the annual Salmon Fest. If anyone knows me well, they know my love for salmon. Oh, I can't wait. As for everything else, it is good.  Ciao

      Words cannot describe how hot today was. It was a hundred degrees....in the shade. We had another tour today. This one brought us to the B-reactor which is 25 miles into a desert. Oh man, words cannot describe. It was painfully hot. We took one big bus out there. There was no air conditioning. Maybe it worked a little, but with 60 people aboard, it wasn't much of anything. It was hot. After 35 minutes for so of driving, we got to this one time, top secret site. Finally. Once inside, much to our dismay, there was again, no air conditioning. I don't think I can stress how hot it was enough. Probably the most grueling trip I have ever took. I would rather take a red-eye to Japan sitting next to Richard Simmons then do that again.  Right after we got back, Nathan, Enrique and I drove down to the river and took a swim. The water was cold but it got our minds off of the atrocity earlier that day. We went to Wal-mart and got a bunch of sporting equipment then played basketball until sunset. What a day. I probably sweated out 10 pounds. Thank God for my water bottle my cousins got me : ) Tomorrow's another day. Must get some sleep.  As for Vanilla Sky, I will defend that movie forever if I have to.... Yours truly, the hero for the masses.  Ciao

      Hey Now! I'm on lunch break here at work. Things are good. I've been working with other people this week, people which are more motivated then the people from last week. Tomorrow we are going on a tour of the site which was used in the Manhattan Project. Iiiiiiiiiiintresting ehh? Ok, not really, but hey, I'm getting paid. The program director is putting it on. He's real cool. He reminds me of a cross between Bert Reynolds and Sean Connery with a Texas accent.  I bought a kite yesterday. It has a snake on it if your interested.  So the next few months I will be thinking seriously about cars and more specifically, buying one. I can't go any further with the girl I once loved. *sigh* So if anyone hears of a good deal on a car, let me know. Well, back to cloning babies.  Ciao

I don't know what it is, but my subconscious is having a field day. Weird..   Saturday was the first day that we didn't really do that much and just took it easy. We went to the mall and that's about it. It's now Sunday morning and  urlLink Spudnuts  is open so I think we may take a ride down to get some breakfast. What is spudnuts you might ask. It's only the best donuts ever made. They are made out of potato flour so they aren't quite as sweet or light as regular donuts. Ahh, thinking of them makes me hungry so I think I'm going now.

      It seems that time is moving fast here. It is now July and I have already completed three weeks of my internship. On one hand is seems like forever since I've been home, but on the other hand, it seems like I've been here forever. I have to say that I have become accustom to Richland and everything surrounding it. I really enjoy it here. I was thinking about it as I was falling asleep last night that time isn't very long here. I have made some really good friends already and I should enjoy it while it lasts. It's funny because the first day I was here, I wanted to shoot myself. It was so deserted and I didn't want to "waste" my summer here. After time other students moved in and things got better. One thing I have learned is that moving away like this (although it is only summer), builds character. I can only hope to travel more and discover other areas of the country and the world. If there is one thing that I like to do, it is seeing other areas and ways of life. I want to experience it all.   So it is a long weekend. The 4th. I don't have any big plans this weekend... mostly just have fun around here. Next weekend I will be going all the way up to Seattle. I am so excited. It's quite a haul, but it should be fun. I bought some film, so if all goes well, I'll have some pictures for everyone soon. I almost bought a digital camera today. I had to resist the temptation so I can get a new car. Liz is getting old. As for everything else it is good. Hope to hear from you all soon.  Ciao

      Hellllo. Today I was on field assignment. That means I get to drive around and do whatever I want on such a lovely afternoon. In actuality, I had to go to the river and collect samples in hopes of harvesting motel fungus. It was once again hot out. I've come to the conclusion that this job is way too easy. But hey, they flew me out here and are paying me so I might as well live it up. It's a three day weekend and I'm not sure what I want to do. As long as I get to see Spiderman 2. There is a guy that  lives in this building that's named Rick James. Superfreak!! I need to work on getting more sleep. Today I fell asleep during my lunch break. I have been waking earlier than I have to. With that said, I am going to get some sleep. For those that I converse with, I'll talk to you later.  Ciao

      Another day goes by. I'm feeling in place at work. The only thing that stinks is that I have to work with another intern. It's ok I guess, it's just that he follows me everywhere I go. He does everything I do. If I have to go get some ice, he comes with me. If we are talking to someone else and I state something, he adds his affirmative "yea". It's just a little much. I wish I could work independently, but I'm stuck with this guy. Other than that, it's been a slow day. My feet are hurting me because I don't have basketball shoes. I get zero support with my current kicks. I'm getting tired of soaking my feet every night. As for everything else, it is good.  Ciao

      Link of the Day:  urlLink My art on the web . This is an old wallpaper I did for Vanessa Carlton's website. I was supprised to see it was still there two years later...  Monday, Monday, Monday... a little karaoke reference for those who may know what I'm talking about. I miss Robin, Fred's crew and belting out Sinatra. *Sigh*  Today was a great day. I was way too motivated for a Monday. Maybe it had to do with the cutie that is two office doors down. Hey! Anything that gets me into work in the morning is good. I've been doing lots of PCR and running them on gels. Basic stuff. Last week I designed my own primers using a couple of bioinformatics databases and got them late last week. So today consisted of running various PCR programs to find which worked best for my fragment. We are working with  urlLink Phanerochaete  (sp?) fungal DNA. I really have to learn how to spell that without looking it up... Anywho, so this week I'm just going to plug away and see how I can get the best results. I even programmed my own program onto the PCR. So, it's been good and productive. It's weird though. I'm so used to working in a fast-paced restaurant gig and now it's all laid back and no one rushes at all. I like it though. We've been playing basketball every night and that has been real good. It sucks that I've gone so long since I last played. It's a real uphill battle, but it's worth it. With the heat, it's a real good workout. As for everything else, it is good.  Ciao gente bella!   p.s. Thanks Krista for the package. You're the best sister in the world!!

      Hola. Today's is Sunday and there isn't a cloud in the sky. Yesterday me and the boys (read bottom of the post) went to downtown Kennawick. It took a while to get there because the town was having "Cool Desert Nights" car show and red neck fest. They blocked off well over two blocks of the main road through town for this event. So we stopped by Spudnuts for brunch. We then spent the rest of our day cruising around in our Kia. Hoit! Yea, that's my new word of the week. Every so often I get a new word and overuse it to the point that it is socially unacceptable to speak anymore. Hoit: To leap; to caper; to romp noisily. OK, so back to my day. Like a bunch of little girls, we went to the mall. When we got back we played our nearly ritualistically game of basketball. I got the idea of running and sliding on the grass as the watering system was running, much like a slip-and-slide. Ah, the good old days of the slip-and-slide, remember that. Well, in hopes to relive my childhood, I did indeed slide quite well. But in the process, tare the heck out of my chest. It was refreshing though. Leave it to me to play the role of the village idiot.  So who are these "boys" that I speak about. Nathan, Enrique and myself tend to do almost everything outside of work together. Nathan is from Illinois. He's 25 and a wise ass. He was in the airforce for a few years and now is going the school thing. A vegetarian and former high school basketball star, Nathan is also quite swell at Arnold Schwarzenegger voices. Enrique is a 20 year old from Phoenix, Arizona. He was wearing a sweatshirt when he first got here because it was "cold".  The youngest one in our posse, Enrique brings some Latin flavor to our group. There you have it. So now when I say the boys or whatever, you know what I'm talking about.  Ciao

      I'm tired. It's Thursday and I was up late last night. Me and the boys went to Super Wal-Mart to get supplies for our trip to Seattle. After I got back I did laundry, so I didn't get to bed until pretty late. I was dragging today. I haven't had coffee in a couple of weeks. I may need a cup tomorrow. I will have pictures when I get back Sunday night, so look out for those. Now on to those questions...   "Are you far from Glacier Mountain? I heard it is spectacular. How about some pictures of where you are?"  - As for the pictures, I'm working on that. Glacier Mountain? I only know of two Glacier mountains, one of them is in Alaska (not so close) and the other is in the Appalachian mountains. There IS a Glacier national park in British Columbia. That is about 10 hours away.   "Do you get tornados over there? Like, you said that it is perfect in WA, so is it flat? (I seem to have always pictured it like that). So it is ideal for tornados? Does it rain often in WA? And what are the nights like there?"   - I wish!!! As you all know, I love weather. Unfortunately there has only been two tornados in the Columbia county that I could find. One is 1966 and the last one in 2000. It is fairly flat here though. There are "mountains" scattered about the area, but they are really more like overgrown hills. There are no trees on them (just sagebrush) and look more like sand dunes. I'll have to take a picture of them. As for rain, the monthly precipitation is 0.4 to 0.6 inches per month. That isn't much at all. As I've said, it's nearly perfect everyday here. Nights are comfortable but not really hot.   "What on earth does your AIM name mean? And I guess that while I am on the subject of names I should ask you where you got static fish from, too?"  - Ahh, the famous sunamizu question! The name sunamizu was actually made up by yours truly. I took two words, suna = sand and mizu = water in Japanese, put them together and you get a beach! Staticfish is my alias which I used a long time on the internet. I didn't want to give out my real name for everything so that was the name I used. It was original given to me as my old Yahoo email password a long time ago. I liked it so I kept it.     "Is it okay if I live vicariously through your adventures?"  - Yes, you can Lameoid.   "Since your in a desolate location, do they let you go 100 mph?"  - NO! It really stinks. I get to go 35 mph though. Yay for me..

      I've come to realize that the locals around here, although nice, are kind of weird. I can't say that for everyone here, but the younger people, they have a weird way about them. I can't put a finger on it. One thing that I'm really not sure about it the drinking water here. It seems really clean and that's what I've heard, but I'm not convinced. For one, this area harbored some nuclear reactors years past and still has plutonium on site in certain areas. For security reasons, that is all of this subject that I am going to speculate on. When you go into any supermarket or any store for that matter, there is tons of bottled water. Nate says that it's probably just a fade targeting the trendy post-boomer market. It very well may be, but one has to wonder. In every supermarket, there are refill stations to refill 20 gallon water coolers. They are obsessed! Who knows...  I will be answering the questions states in my  urlLink post  a few days ago soon. As for now, over and out.  Ciao

      Link of the Day: urlLink BPM    Looks like somebody has a bad case of the Tuesdays. I took the weekend off concidering no one would have been online anyway. Well a long weekend behind us and Tuesday is but hours away from me. It was a fairly low key weekend because we are going to Seattle next weekend. The 4th was good. There was a little shindig and the  urlLink UHF . I found a little  urlLink website  that shows what the rooms look like here. You have to have  urlLink QuickTime to view them. I'm starting to take pictures so I promise I'll have some up soon for all to see. I'm writing a short film right now that we are planning on filming later on this month. I'll try to see if I can get it on the web as well. Looking at my site visits over the weekend, I can tell that everyone has been having a good time.   Friday there was a motivational speaker that came to speak to us. I snickered before hand as my mind envisioned Matt Foley in all his glory. He actually was really good. Either that, or he brainwashed me. The brunette in my office gave me her number. I guess she's not out of my league. Oh yea, I don't play in a league. I'm looking forward to doing some work this week. It's been good. So, here goes a new week..   Ciao

       urlLink    Today is Saturday. Last night all the people from the UHF got together. It was some fun. I've noticed something. The people from this area have an accent. It's very suddle, but it's there. They pronounce their S sound a little weird. I can't even describe it. At first I just thought it was my co-worker. Then I noticed the same exact nuance from that girl I went to lunch with. So it's something from the people that have lived here for sometime. She said that I have an accent. I don't even remember what I said, but she made me repeat it and laughed. So I smacked her. We are going to check a local club tonight. See what the awesome Tri-city area has for a scene. Ha! It's no Miami I'm sure. Everyone calls me Emo. It's like everywhere I go I get a nickname. What's the deal with that. I guess I see where this one comes from though. Man I need a shower.

      It's anther great day out. If anyone's keeping tabs, it's now 36 beautiful days, 3 bad days (1 rainy, 2 overcast). You just can't do better than that.   I've told you all a little bit about some of my friends out here. I haven't told you about Jessie though. Jessie isn't in our CCI program but we know him because he lives in the same complex as Nate. Jessie is an Italian from New York; a true grease ball. He provides the comic relief. He's too funny. He went up with us to Seattle this past weekend. It's the four of us now. we usually do everything together. Tonight's a BBQ at the town beach/park. Wherever there is food, I am there. Tomorrow is Friday and that means.... I don't know. No big plans yet. It would be nice to catch up on some sleep.    Caution. Rant of the Week:  I have been watching TV a little bit lately and I have come to realize something that I really found depressing. Turn on the Discovery Channel or TLC and you will find that the programing is quite different from what it used to be. Take the Discovery channel for example. What happened to the nature shows and educational programing? You can't turn the channel without seeing another dumb motorcycle show. I swear there are at least 5 of them. If not, then they constantly repeat the damn thing. Since when has true bikers sat down and watched some creatine eating moron yell at his sons for not putting the right fuel injector into his chopper? I mean, come on. And don't let me get started on The "Learning" Channel. Someone should look up the meaning of the word learning at that station. I swear if I see one more freaking Trading Spaces or Trading Spaces ripoff show, I'm going to stick my foot through the TV. Come to think about it, I bet if I go in the other room and turn on the TV right now, one of those two shows will be on. Here it goes...Wow, kudos to the Discovery Channel for airing "CIA Secrets" some special on the CIA. I wish I could say the same for TLC. They had their stupid "Clean Sweep" show on. A team of five people cleaning someone's horribly messy room. THAT'S ON TV? Someone cleaning a room. It's insane. Just go to their website as the describe the show as "Clean Sweep is an emotionally charged yet often comedic hour of television." That statement is too ridiculous for words so with that I bid you adu.   Ciao   Note:  In light of past great shows such as This Old House, I have to admit that in moderation home shows can be interesting. I just think it is stupid and irresponsible for a station to stick to one idea and be so closed minded to other subjects of programing.

      Hey, hey , hey. This is only my second post since I got back from Seattle. I've have been tired from a long weekend and work. I almost passed out at my desk yesterday. After a week of cooler weather (80's) it's finally nice and hot out (100's). I wish it was like that more in CT. So today I went out to lunch with a couple of girls that work on my floor. One girl was raving about a  urlLink taco truck  that parks somewhere and has real Mexican food for next to nothing. So, we checked that out. Man, it was good. I got these pork tacos with cilantro and lime. Oh, so good. I also got this burrito that if I had to guess, weighed 6 pounds. It was my lunch and dinner. The same girl had a friend at an express shop so we got italiano sodas for free. It was a good lunch and since food consumes my every thought, then that makes it a good day.   Work is going good. There seems to be more to do around the lab. I can just go in and start of things. I've taken the initiative to work on minor projects.   I played basketball with a couple of guys that live with Nate. Let me paint you a picture. These two "brothers" are at least 6 foot, 250. They know how to play ball. I got dunked on a few times. I feel like an old man today. I'm a little sore. If anything will improve my game, it will be that.   I am going to be online at work now and then so if you are so inclined, my work email currently is xannecharicox. As for everything else, it is good.  Ciao

      Holy Monday Batman! Man, what a weekend. Seattle was a blast. It's such a nice city. I thought it would have been bigger (83.9 square miles as compared to New York's 303.3), but its cleaner. Friday night we went out to the clubs. If you pay 12 bucks cover at one place, nearly every other in the area will accept the stamp you get. It was a good deal. We stayed at the Warwick which Enrique's cousins had, which meant we had a free place to stay. You just can't beat that. Saturday we went to Pikes Market. For someone that loves food as much as I do, it was a sacred experience. The fresh seafood and produce was so amazing. It's no wonder that Jeff Smith called Pikes Market Square his home for the remainder of his life. Jeff Smith was the Frugal Gourmet, a TV chef, who died this past Friday. We ate like kings. Saturday I had the best meal in my life,  hands down . The restaurant called "The Crab Pot" has a meal called "The Westport". They literally dump pounds of seafood on the table in front of you. Muscles, snow and king crab legs, shrimp, clams, and corn. Throw in a glass of chardonnay and it was heaven. Everything was so fresh. We went up the Space Needle too. The drive back was about 4 hours, not too bad, except there were four guys in a Kia. I swear I had the pedal to the floor the whole way back. All in all it was a great trip. Ahhhh Monday, a new weeks starts...   Ciao

       urlLink    I have been eating a ton of mexican food lately. Washington is similar to California in that there are a lot of hispanic people in the area. This is then corrilated to the number of taco joints in the area. There is a Taco Bell that is right down the street but that isn't even the half of it. There are these taco trucks that I mentioned earlier. Man, I'm addicted. I really feel like I've gained a few pounds between the tacos and all the protein I'm trying to comsume.  I went to the local bar for Karaoke Monday night. I sang some Sinatra and some Seger. A couple of women came up to me after and offered to buy me drinks. Too bad I don't drink. It was flattering all the same.  I got Jesse to go up and sing Alanis Morissette's "Ironic". It cost me 10 bucks, but it was worth it. Ahh, back to work.     Ciao

       urlLink    Today is Sunday. Yesterday we went to the mall. I am addicted to this store called  urlLink Buckle . Its not a good thing. We had a nice Saturday night staying in and playing cards and eating pizza. I was good to chill out for a night. Today we went to the park and went swimming in the river. The water was a bit warmer then last time I went in. A couple of girls came over and invited us to play volleyball and we ended up hanging out with them for the rest of the day. Im now about to make my second dinner. I played football today too with a bunch of guys at the park. I had to touchdowns, one interception and 4 tackles (one sack). Not too shabby for being the smallest guy there. This picture was taken right next to where Im staying. As you can see, the grass is always green. Well, Im pretty hungry so I must go.

       urlLink     I've always heard girls talk about their shampoo with loyalty and passion. Most are very picky with what they use. I think I now truly understand why. I had a couple of Herbal Essence travel bottles I've been using. Well, I ran out the other day and used the free shampoo packets that they give you when housecleaning comes in. Oh man, when I woke up the next morning I looked like Kareem Abdul Jabbar in his early days. I had a fro dammit! That shampoo made my hair so dry and big. I guess I wouldn't have noticed this if I cut my hair to the length of normal, yet uninteresting guys. So needless to say, I bought some more shampoo and I'm still wearing a hat all the time.   Today if Friday! I have no idea what I am doing this weekend. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing...  Ciao

       urlLink     Research papers aren't that difficult. I actually don't mind them given I have the time. I have been working on my assignment paper the past few days. The problem with this paper is that I'm kind of stumbling in the dark. I don't have a "real" assignment, but have done work for many different projects within my building. I don't have a "real" superior to report to. Although I have someone who has guided us most of the summer. The problem with that is he is always away on some conference or symposium. Needless to say, the writing process is slow and agonizing right now. Hopefully when Scott gets back I can pick his brain a bit in order to get a better idea of what he would like to see in this bedlam of a paper.   Last night we went to the local watering hole for free tacos. Nothing says I love you like free tacos. The place was bizarre. When you first walk in you think its just a townie bar with their country and blue playing in the background while a couple of locals are shooting some billiard. But then you look up on the walls and they have these modern-like pictures straight out of the 80's. Then of course what local bar would be without free wireless internet access. By the time I got the tacos, I wasn’t sure what to expect next. After that, we went down to the river. I found this really cool spot right by where we are staying. It’s kind of hidden and at night it’s a perfect place to just chill. That was my eventful evening. Today marks the 3 weeks left in my stay here. I still have a bunch of things I want to do here. I still haven’t visited any wineries. This is one of the continents best wine making regions . It would be a shame if I didn’t experience it. We are also still debating a trip up to Canada. It’s a haul, but I’m sure it would be fun. Hope CT and where ever you are is treating you good. Stay classy.  Ciao  p.s. I would like to say hi to my Italian friend visiting this site all the way over in Europe!

      I found myself in the irony of corporate America. I was talking amongst my co-workers in the hallway, apathetical to what was being said. Right then and there a comprehension and perception of reality by means of a sudden intuitive realization, I experienced an epiphany, a spiritual awakening of sorts. I WAS HAVING A WATERCOOLER CONVERSATION. Yes, you heard that right, I was amidst the most cliché of gatherings. I have heard much about these water cooler assemblies from Dilbert and Seinfeld, but alas I never experienced it in all its glory. Even as a young boy, I could only imagine what it would be like to converse with people while drinking out of a paper cone. Now my friends, I am one of them. It has taken me some time, but I can honestly say that I have drank my fill with the most random people, talking about the most random stuff. Oh how honored am I.

      Yea, so it was another night of free tacos and karaoke. It still amazes me that people love my singing. I thought I would get a clap here and there, but high fives?? Girl's numbers? You'd think that old Blue Eyes was there himself. I sang four Sinatra tunes. Come Fly With Me, My Way, Got The World On a String and When Somebody Loves You. Oh... and I almost forgot, the Cars "Just What I Needed".   The research paper is coming along. It's not the end of the world, but it does take quite a bit of brain power to come up with a clear objective from all the random work I've done over the summer. It's hard to believe that I have only two weeks left here. Time kind of flew by, but at the same time, I feel like I've lived here forever. I know the area so well and the guys I hang out are as close as anyone I know. My mentor is taking me out to lunch next week. He wants me to come back next year. I thought about taking a full time job out here for the fall but it isn't what I want right now. Well, I'm about ready for bed so until next time....  Ciao

      The Bourne Identity was a great movie, so I was really excited when the sequel was coming out. Jesse was going to go with me to see it but he hadn't seen the first one yet. I wanted to buy the DVD anyway. I guess me and every other red blooded American had the same idea. We toured the entire Tri-city area searching for this movie. Blockbuster and Hollywood Video (I would even rent it) Walmart! When does walmart not have anything. I mean it's the size of Texas. We finally ended up at Best Buy and they had literally a thousand of them. I guess they were hoarding all of them.   Last night we went to this club called "The Beach". It was like nothing else I have ever seen. The waitresses were wearing board shorts and sandals. There was bamboo all over the place (even a couple bamboo polls) and Mai Tai's were all the rage. Keep in mind you have to drive 6 hours to get to the ocean. It was pretty cool though. There I was in my express dress shirt and shoes while these homeboys are dancing in sandals and  wife beaters.   I'm starting to look forward to returning home. Times are good out here but I'm ready to do something else. Hey, I'm gonna go out and GET THE WORLD BY THE TAIL and wrap it around and pull it down and put it in my pocket. (5 bucks to the person who knows what quote that is from.) Alright, I'm out of here.  Ciao
