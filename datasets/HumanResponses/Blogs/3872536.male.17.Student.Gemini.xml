Then see quite a few tjcians at e library mugging (so scary). Then eat at hawker and when we return to the library, kana chased out so went BK study. Spending bucks. Haiz...  Then went new house to swim (or rather try to swim lol)  Wkends --- Family day. If i'm not mistaken, we went to buy mattress. And the next day move stuff to my new house lor. Damn tired. coz moving tables etc... Training...  Mon (21/6) --- Went self study wif choon pei then happen to meet wee teck at the library. Initially he's supposed to meet his friend/s but ended up his friends ps him so he joined us. Then eat at mac.  Tues (22/6) --- Went self-study wif kai cheng at tamp library. He's like complaining how far tamp is lor. Somemore i late hehe... Then happen to meet choon pei and her friends thr. Study till like 12++ then go bk eat. Then kai cheng appetite too good, went for 2nd round at KFC then settled thr to study. He was like wanting to eat the kachang putei (sorri duno how to spell) but ended up not eating coz too full liao. Hmm... It looks like tat day's a eating trip rather then self-study. But quite fun :p  Wed (23/6) --- It's my turn to go ang mo kio for self-study wif kai cheng coz he lives in huogang mah. Then somehow can't get to the library even though he gave mi the directions. Haiz, tat's mi lor. Then the view surrounding the library was like so damn nice till i dun feel like studying and ended up sleeping. I onli completed a set of econs notes tat day. Then again, kai cheng was like complaining how hungry he was at about 12++, whrby i reach thr like bout 11 lor. Then ended up eating at the nearby hawker. He bought a $3.80 stuff and still not filling, while i onli spent like $2.90. Then went mos burger studying and bought drinks. Money wasted again. After like 1h thr we decided to go back library...(money wasted 4 the drink man) On our way thr kc was complaining hungry AGAIN but ended up onli bought one bottle of sour plam ding and fried bananas. Then go library slack... After tat on our way home, kindof influenced by him uh... It's mi tat's searching 4 food liao. We ended up buying rojak (coz i like it). Hmm.. Another day wasted ba, but still satisfying coz i reach amk alone... Haha..  Thurs (24/6) --- Went self-study. Initially i dun wan de but haf to pass something to choon pei so i went. Meet pei yu and kain beng and go self-study at Bk. I ended up buying chicken nuggets and cake even though i had had my lunch lor. Then learnt some magic tricks from pei yu and do some self-reflections of kian beng thr.  Another day gone man but it's ok coz i learnt magic tricks haha...

      Nuthing special today juz slacking and mugging.  Wake up rather late today and tot I'll at least finish reading through half of my maths notes, but I lack the motivation to do so. I ended up sleeping 4 almost the whole afternoon.  Then haf a chat on the phone wif kian beng, whereby we share the difficulties each faces. He's realli changed to be more matured in a way and has realli learned to treasure friendship. Haiz... Pple have realli changed man. Remember how crazy and childish we once were in sec school. That was realli the time I enjoy myself man. But everything must change as time flies. Perhaps I should realli be more matured and crap less ba. Dun realli noe wat others want mi to be at times. It's easy telling others to be wat they truely are but when it comes to myself, I'm rather confused at times.  Hmm.. More of self-reflections today. Duno wat to do wif my JCT. Dun think can finish studying.  Ok, that's all for today. Think there'll wun be anything interesting awaiting mi this holiday coz all attention will be put on the JCT.  Jia you to everyone out thr struggling...

      Hmm... Sorri.. Long time never write blog liao, coz too buzi and tired these days... Ok, I'll seperate the whole string of events into diiferent days...   11/6--- Day 1 of LEO camp..  Went to my Temasek Sec to collect my 'O' levels cert early in the morning lor. Stepped out of my house with my huge bag containing the stuff for my camp etc. Went to the void deck and my bag was torn lol, so haf to repack my stuff. Initially, I'm suppose to meet Jia Yin to go collect cert together de but ended up she has to go first lol. After which went back TJ for maths mass tutorial. So sian lor coz our maths tutor has already gone through most of the questions liao but it's ok coz i copied many things wrongly during her lesson lol... Then the camp begins... The beginning of the camp was like quite messy lah coz it's hard to gather pple lor. Then station masters are supposed to reach the destinated place liao, but i still haf to stay in TJ to help clear the hall tat's packed wif chairs and tables lor. Then I went thr alone to clear the chairs as i haf nuthing to do in the canteen wat. Rather do something then slack there lol. Then Esmond, lai wei and leonard came and i left for my station. SO satisfied wif myself lor coz i actually managed to reach clarke quake alone lor. As u all noe i'm rather poor when it comes to direction and mrt system lol. Then reach clarke quake liao and found out tat the station masters thr were having lunch at liang court, where i duno how to go and haf to ask the other grp tat reached to bring my thr lol... I wonder who's playing the urban hunt lol... Nevertheless, I enjoyed it :P At clarke quake thr, we actually made the grps sing the school song at the bungee area lol and it was somehow quite sian coz thr's not many pple thr lor, except the pple at the ticket booth. And i rmb one of the pple in charge of the bungee was actually saying their singing can't make it lol... Rather fun thr lol coz we made them do couple dance and sing and do handsigns 4 the leo theme song: Shimmering with love... Rather tired after that.After which we went back to TJ to haf our dinner and if i'm not mistaken it's chicken rice. Pple thr were like not realli tat considerate coz some beings ate more than 1 pack lor then ended up most committee members didn't get to haf it and still there are pple complaining the chicken rice ish not enuff lor... Hiaz sian... If only they noe our plight man... Then the night games begins... Kai Tze(if i spelt correctly) and i were in the same grp lor and we r in charge of the games whereby pple haf to gather in their grps blindfolded and recognising their grp mates using a hand sign lor. Then I think we realli enjoyed playing coz we tried to learn their handsigns and try to be in their grp, after which we lead them round the whole area lol.... Then I oso pulled their ears and tapped their head while their playing lol... So fun... Haha... Despite some confusion wif the grping thing, i think the game was quite successful lol... We had supper after all the games lor, and some of the committee were preparing MILO lor.. Haha wif miss wong's help, the milo was rather nice... Then here comes the real nightmare!!! John one of the member was complaining bout one of the game, obituaries, whereby the committee mistakenly put the photo of a living ex-president under one of the obitaries lor. He oso complained about the station at BUgis where pple haf to make themselves wet. He complained about getting himself wet lor and say the chlorine in the water will harm his ears and nose etc... Despite the whole committee apologising to him, he still continue scolding us lor. Realli duno wat's wrong wif him lor sian... Ok lah enuff of him liao. Dun let him spoil my mood again... The whole committee didn't get any sleep tat day lor except 4 a few lor. Most were playing games while i'm doing a flash animation of the photos taken for the concert the day after. Finish the stuff at bout 6 something bout but haiz... can't present it coz it lag too much liao... Sian... All my hard work out to waste man...   12/6--- Day 2 of the camp..  Again... Preparing breakfast for pple lor... Then tat lw wanted mi to conduct pt wif him lor, but i rejected coz i was helping out wif the breakfast and was like so damn tired coz stare at the com the whole night lor. I noe lw was tired oso lah... Anyway sorry lor... Then the day games begin... I was in charge of the blackjack thing lah whereby the winning team gets to pour (either water, soya sauce, flour or chilli, at least 2) on the lossing team lor. Then the grps damn cute lor. Some allied, some pour on the sleeves or legs and many say oppss... and pour the ding into the drain lor... After tat go help jia yin tat station, whereby i get to enjoy myself thr lor coz we were like pouring soya sauce into the water and pouring it to the committee while waiting 4 the grps lor... Hmm.. Still rmb my head has the soya sauce smell after tat... Haha... Jia Yin and kai Tze were oso wet lor... Then junming and jia yin went to see other station lor... Leaving mi alone thr to clear up the stuff thr lor moving tables, washing tables and clearing the mess thr lor... After which went back to canteen to rest a while when lw ask mi to help carry tables from the sports complex lor. He must mi thinking i'm like slacking thr the whole while lor... Anyway sorri again... Then go help carry the tables back to the classrm lor. Then prepare dinner or rather serving dinner liao... Ms wong actually gave out too much rice initially then the rice nor enuff and some pple and the whole committee didn't get to eat the rice lor. Luckily thr're some chicken and eggs etc left behind. Then here somes the concert. The concert was somehow quite successful lah except tat our committee performance wunt that perfect lor... I'm so glad the pple and most importantly the seniors were saying that the door gifts we prepared were nice lor... Wat to do i was the project ic lol...  3 cheers and 3 cheers for the committee... Though it was not a perfect camp we've prepared, but i truely think we've realli gone all out to our max liao lor. So good job man... Though thr might be some misunderstandins among the committee, but pple it's all over and we've reached our destination.... Though some may not be pleased wif us, wif the camp, but it's already the best we can do... Nv look down on yrself Kai Tze... U've always been a good food IC man... Dun let some hurting words obstruct u from moving to greater heights.... Once again... Great job man.... And most importantly i get to noe more pple (esp. gals lol)   13/6--- Resting day..  Hmm.. sorri 4 not writing blog coz i slept early and woke up late. Then went to support kim heng for the vege fiesta ding lor... As a friend who's known him for many yrs, I went to support him lor. And he realli did a great job coz he was the overall ic for the games section... Now i noe how bad my skills were, coz i get quite low pts lol... Nevertheless, i enjoyed tat... Thanks for inviting mi... After tat went new house do deal wif some stuff till bout 7 ba... After which, come back home to deal wif the curtain ding and slept... A rather short yet meaningful day 4 mi man...   14/6--- Slacking..  Initially I planned to mug today de but my motivation's not thr lor.. Then ended up slacking, watching tv and sleeping lol... Think i realli haf to start liao coz it's already like 2 more wks lor and i'm still haiz... Juz not in the mood lah. Rather worried lor... Haiz....

      Hmm... Nuthing much today lahz. Juz feeling frustrated and tired ba..,  Went to school for leo camp meeting today AGAIN. GO thr stick the magnet on the clay 4 the door gifts lor. Rather convinced with the final product lor. Haha.  After which we learn the committee item 4 the concert. Leonard and some other members actually managed to get the so called dance done within today lor. Hidden talents in the committee ba...  Rather frustrated with Esmond today lor. Last minute then tell mi cant get the projector 4 the concert. Then how on earth are we going to show the animation to the guests lol. He wanted mi to like to the animation but it's like no projector, then do 4 wat lol. He suggested that I go home and do the animation b4 the concert at nite while they are having the camp in school lor. As if I can complete within such a short time lor. Sian... Then he expect mi to go home and then return back to TJ again at nite mehz... Sian lah dun noe wat he's thinking about lol. Juz hate last minute changes.  Initially I wanted to have pw meeting tml de, to do the survey, coz tot thr'll be no meeting tat day lor. But haiz... Got the camp meeting again lor. I realli dun mind going 4 meetings, but can't they like prepare everything in advanced first so that we will not be like slacking thr, duno wat to do... It's realli a waste of time man. Juz take 4 eg lah, some of us were like doing the door gifts and we like took quite a long time. Can't the rest like think of some ideas for the event rather than juz toking and resting lor. Sian...  The camp is like on friday and we have yet to borrow the projector lol...  Then we suggested on burning the animation to be prepared to be burned into a CD for the guests, but last minute, no cd burner, then the gift how lehz....  Juz hope that Esmond managed to borrow an external cd burner and a projector ba, if not the animation and gift will be like screwed up lol...

      Yowns... Damn tired man.  Rather enjoy myself today lol 4 the eclub camp, esp the game organised by the yr 2: Where do you wana go now. Rather amazed they actually came out wif this game lol. Our starting pt was pasir ris and end at east coast park. We get to play some gamees or rather a challenge at every station we go lol. Though our grp lost in the end, I'm rather happy coz I get to noe more pple in my grp lol. Though we have different interest, (as in they were like shopping about toking bout movies and ps games lol) at least I noe them better lol. Haha. Then went to east coast park then somehow slack thr coz all the activities are not carried out as planned lor, due to last minute changes. So the committee actually gave them free time till the bbq in school lor.   Had a tok wif the yr 2 BOD today. It's like everyone's voicing their opinions lor. And i truely think that we the bod need to be more bonded lor, and like what zhen yi said lah I should realli be more outspoken lor. I assure it's a challenge I'll accept and try my best to overcome man... Rest assured I will...   Had a tok with wei jie and pei ching at the beach today lor. It's when we realli voice our opinions out lor. Wei jie actually said that the B.O.D announced is not realli confirmed and some changes might be made. When I knew tat I was like oh my... better not let tis happen man coz it's like bringing u to the top of the ladder and making u fall lor. I admit I can't realli bond the grp lah, but isit realli my fault lol. Haiz. Like what zhen hui said lor it's like tat initially lol. Hopefully ba... haha. Yah lah wat wei jie said might be rite lah. He and Vivian actually contribute so much to eclub but in the end didn't get a post, so haiz... No wonder they not realli happy lor...  Things turned out better during the bbq. Though I'm not in the camp committee, I actually helped out lor to start the fire, serve food save food 4 teacher etc. I realli wonder whether my hard work is like recognised lor. It's like all other camp committee except a few were like enjoying themselves playing ball games and oso other games in their own grps lor, so it was like no one is acually thr to help with the bbq stuff lor, except 4 a grp of gals lor. Haiz... What to do lor. So damn tired today lor, walking around serving food and drinks to various grps, help clear up the stuff and pack the leftovers into boxes 4 pple to bring home. Kept asking around but no one wants lor, so I brought it home and it's like curry lor. When I reach home the box containing the curry actually leaked lol. Sian....  Did so much 4 the club, but is it realli recognised? Juz hope that tis will give them a better impression of mi ba... A way of bonding... I nv expect anything in return lor, juz hope tat they'll accept mi lol   Anyway i'm used to doing such things liao, coz sec school oso like tat lor.  So happy that i actually managed to noe more faces and chat wif them after the camp man.  No matter what happen, no matter how hard the road ahead might be, I'll never give up man... (strive high~)  3 cheers and 3 cheers 4 the eclub camp man... Though it's not realli as successful as expected, all the hard work and effort u guys had put in can be seen and recognised....

      Hmm... Receive present 4 my birthday from my parents lol. Sling bag and keychain. They passed them to mi early tis morning lol. Haha. Realli thanks them man...    Today's eclub camp rather interesting lor. At least the activities they planned are not too disgusting lol. I onli noe i had a hard time walking after turning 4 like 10 rounds lor. Ran into the wall... So shameful lol coz saw triple images. Haiz wat to do my eyesight got prob the lah.  But nevertheless, I enjoyed it lol.  They announced the B.O.D for eclub today and I actually got the chairperson post lol. Actually I knew it a wk b4 lor, but the teacher told mi not to reveal it so... Initially, I tot it's my own barrier tat I have to overcome but after the first meeting I realised it's not lor. Thr's realli a tough route ahead lor. I'm supposed to conduct the mission setting 4 eclub today lor and I ask the members thr to contribute ideas and suggestions. Initially, it was rather smooth-sailing but when I ask them 4 suggestions on events to be planned, they start stoning liao. Then after tat got the grping stuff. Since no one initiate to reallocate their names, I have no choise but to reallocate in random so that each grp have equal no. of pple lor. Then the AHS pple and others were like so unsatisfied wif mi lor, and they didn't even voice it out. How you expect mi to know lor! Sianz... How to get the support of the whole club if every meeting's like tis lor. Onli noe how to speak duno how to do lor.... Haiz no offense here. Juz saying how i truely feel. But rather happy lai wei got a post man coz I'm afraid he'll be angry wif mi should he not get one? Or will he quit eclub? Doubts~ Rather sad today coz pple out thr mostly think it's leonard who'll be the chair lor. Then I scared can't get their fullest support lol. Wat to do dun realli noe everyone thr well lor. Almost broke down today when the whole club was like stoning or rather chatting among themselves. Can u imagine tat: looking around and everyone was like staring at u with the looks tat show a thousand unhappiness... It's looks as if thr's no one beside mi when i needed help most lor. What a failure I am when it comes to tis man. I didn't ask 4 much. Juz your support and contributions are more than sufficient lor. ;(lo  Then went shopping 4 the gifts 4 guests 4 leo club with lai wei. Finally bought 3 cd stand cum clock lol. I think it's more of like finding food to eat rather than shopping 4 the gifts lor. Coz we spent more time finding food than shopping lor.  Luckily went out shop after the eclub camp lor, if not I doubt I can realli pull thr today lor.   Rather confused now. Feel like giving up sometimes but I try my very best to overcome the difficultits. Hope the route ahead isn't as difficult as I realli think it is. Duno how i'm gona face the other club members tml again lor during the camp. Haiz.   Why's all these happening during my birthday lehz.... Haiz. Anyway realli thanks to leonard n lai wei who announce it's my b'dae today during the camp lol. And thanks to the club 4 singing b'dae song for mi.  Am I really a failure? ;(

      Another tired but meaningful day.  Today went school as usual to do the door gifts for the Leo camp. Do from 11 to about 4+ ba. We actually managed to finish all the doorgift by today lor, all the painting n writing of words. So satisfied with our product from far. Coz the doorgifts look so colourful n nice from far, but when one actually moves closer, it's like you'll see many cracks on it lor. So I was suggesting that we'll show the guests how nice our gifts are but when distributing the stuff, we'll off the lights and when they actually see it at home it's like we've already stepped down, so it's not our busi lor. Juz being lame then lah. Enjoy so much doing the gifts lol. Then eat lotsa stuff 4 lunch coz damn hungry (rojak n mince meat noodle lor).  After tat go TM shop for xxx birthday present lol. But didn't realli think of wat to buy coz it's either too ex or I think it's not suitable for her lol. Haiz gona go out another day to buy again lor. I think lai wei n jia yin are quite irritated wif mi lah coz i always can't make up my mind lol. Nevertheless we had one neoprint taken n it's like quite cute lol coz jia yin want mi n lai wei stick our tongue out lol n it's like something gals do lol. Nevertheless, I did it lol for the fun of it, but that lai wei never do lor then I look so weird in there lol. But never mind it's fun :P  After which go new house see how's the lighting like. Quite satisfied wif it coz it's my family n my hardwork in finding the lights lol.  Yah so today can be said to be a day of satisfaction for me man... Fianlly... Haha. How nice everday's like today, no worries bout tutorials n JCT haha...
