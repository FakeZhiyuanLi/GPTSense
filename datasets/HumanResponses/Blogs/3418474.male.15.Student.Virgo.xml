      Man I haven't written one of these forever.  This past weekend was pretty cool.  Youth was awesome I loved the worship and the small groups were cool.  Saturday I went and helped the food bank that was rad.  Umm sunday I went to church and then set up a trampoline and then I played softball later that night.  My Life with God is pretty good:)...It's kinda tough not having many people to talk to.  I wanna be the light Jesus has called me to be but it is tough.  God's been keeeping me real busy lately sorta to get my mind off the friend situation.  Right now...SOnja is kinda my only good friend and it sorta sucks but at least she's a rad girl:).  I'm trying to live this thing for God and just be the light in the darkness and just try and live for God with my all.  I find it way easier to hang out with people who actually give a crap bout what's goin on in my life.  I love it when people just take time to talk with me and stuff.  I find myself being really fake when I'm with people that already have a bunch of friends and I mean nothing to them.  I love it when I act like the Real Jordan It feels great:).    I'm not quite sure of God's purpose or his plan...But everyday I wanna live Christ:).  It's totally worth it to surrender your all to God cuz he'll only do great works in u.  I haveta stop being of the World...and just be fully like Christ.  My life has a pretty bright future in that It's gonna involve Jesus and God's Plan soo it has to be bright.  I haven't changed soo dramtically yet that people wouldn't know it's me...but that's what I'm planning on doing.  Changing into a true christ follower instead of one of those kids who have things good in their Lives but they never effect the rest of the world.  ANd just let Jesus take hold of everything.  It takes alot of Faith and I am afraid...I shouldn't be but I am...I wanna become fully real and act the same around everyone.  I'm hoping that over the summer and stuff I can really get some friendship booming and just also become really close with God and become real.  People usually fall away from God in the summer I wanna do the opposite and just stick to God like glue.  ANyways guys...If u need prayer just write it in a comment or email me:) That'd be great...It also be Rad if u guys all pray for me and that My walk with CHrist would turn into a sprint:P ANyways cya all later bubye and GOD BLESS AMERICA:) haha not GOD BLESS U:P

      These past few days I've been pretty busy...Me n Josh built a soccer net yesterday after church...It's pretty sweet:D.  Today I went boating with my family and that was really fun.  My dad basically let me drive the whole time it was awesome.  My life is seeming more and more purposeful.  I just love being in God's presence and worshipping him it's amazing.  I'm hoping that everyday I live my life a lil more true to who I'm supposed to be.  I'm sick of being fake...and sick of putting up fronts:S.  I'm aiming to be totally real and just being who God wants me to...Instead of being soo stupid and being who I made up myself to be.  Right now My life is pretty distraction free soo it's pretty awesome.  I don't have any friends tieing me down...or any girls I'm likeing or any girlfriends:P.  It makes God way more accessible and makes it way easier to find time to get close to him.  I've spent soo long just at the same place:S...Like where I wanted God with all of me but there was soo much holding me back.  I was afraid of stuff and now I've given it to God.  Life's looking brighter everyday.  Idn what my future is but I know God's plans r gonna be played out. anyways:P...If u care to comment do it..otherwise w/e haha God bless ya guys cya later

      Another day another dollar...I've done nothing today:P cept some chores and I also watched Peter Pan the movie:D haha it's actually pretty good it kinda exactly copied the disney cartoon version tho.  My life right now is good for the most part.  I'm trying with all of me to focus on God with everything I do.  I've made soo many mistakes in these past few weeks and it's been a real bummer cuz I've lost alot of people and also...grades:P.  I'm slowing finding the real me.  The real me is who God's created me to be not who I was trying to be.  Haha these past few weeks I've been also really fake just cuz I didn't know how to handle the pressure:s...and there again I lost alot because of it and gained a whole bunch of things I don't need.  I want to be exactly what God created me to be.  I know this is a bold statement, but I wanna just do w/e God asks and give my life to him...I was afraid to do this for soo long thinking maybe he wouldn't get me the girl I want, maybe he wouldn't get me the friends I need, maybe I'd just end up as some pastor somewhere and just not having fun and just not having very much money:P these have all been doubts of mine, but now...Me and Jesus hand and hand are gonna walks this....and if I fall he'll pick me up...If i'm tired he'll carry me...if I'm down he'll lift me up...If life feels hopeless he'll give me hope:).  God Rules!!!  regardless your situation just embrace God...Life can't get any better than when u do.  Another thing...Don't fall into Spiritual Pride. Idn who this is for...but God put this on my heart to just write this:P...haha Idn who reads these prolly not many but just don't think ur strong enough to do things that u have a weakness towards like say go to a party where there's alcohol...or do stuff with friends that aren't on fire for God...Or maybe even just u got a weakness with the opposite sex:s but just don't think ur strong enough cuz ur not.  God can be ur strength and get u through anything...but if u open up a door to your weakness then Satan can take control of your life....and once he does this you'll fall flat on your face. Alright well...Idn if u want things to be prayed for just tell me anyone who cares and reads this:)...I wanna pray for anyone who wants me to. Anyways God Bless u guys:) take care

      haha I decided to go with the fad:P(y) and make myself a blog.  Haha life for me this past while has been really rough.  Idn...I guess I just lost my footing a bit and God became less of a thing and my friends, school, and parents relationships became more priorities because everyone of those things was screwed:P.  I've made a committment and I'm giving my all to God.  I want Jesus to be my bestfriend...and man I'm sick of lukewarm living.  I've been really talking to God lately...and man I've just given like all these problems I have to him...and like nothing has really been solved...but I've got a peace about it.  My relationship with my parents has been kinda junky this past while...I've been constantly having to humble my self and apologize, but I'm finding God gives me an obedience that I can't help but do what they ask.  The Friends Sitch is pretty trashed:P...I kinda blew it a bunch with a bunch of different people.  Man  Idn who God has for me as friends...but I'm hoping God brings someone quick.  And I know u think like o u got tons of friends:P like...I'm looking for close friends...not shallow hang out friends.  Once u've had a best friend u can't go without one if u know what I mean...It's just like someone is there and they care soo much for u and they just wanna talk to u:)...and just know how ur doin.  Jesus and me r gonna get super tight...but if u know what i mean...it's kinda like u need someone who u can see and someone who's physically there:P Idn.  Welp Anyways...I'm really excited bout what life has in store,  I'm doin this thing for God...and I'm gonna do w/e that takes:)...GOD RULES EH???  Blessed be his glorious name!!!:D haha reply if u wish:) haha comments are nice

      Man summer is here Yea baby!!!!!:)  I decided to leave all these thing up to God again.  I'm feeling great about the friends situation...God will provide all I have to do is trust in him.  TOday I worked down at my dad's job site and that was kinda wearing on me cuz i went to bed at one and I think I woke up at 6 this morning cuz my dad woke me up to get me to work:S and I didn't even know I was gonna work:S. Then I came home and put up lawn furniture and skateboarded:P...haha weird eh I think I might start skateboarding again.  :P Haha that was my day and most people already probably heard an exact replica:P.   It's soo hot out it's amazing:) I wanna get myself a wicked tan.  I'm taking off to Cali tomorrow to ride the waves:P...haha I wish naahh I'm goin to Saskatchewan to ride the tractors hahaha:P bad comparison.  But yea hopefully I have fun down there or over there.  Grrr :@ k well I'm absolutely done with living even the tinyest bit away from my Jesus.  I'm gonna go for it all and get as close as I can.  I've given alot of thought to the things I've said on this blog and I've decided that I should fulfill em.  I know the right way and since i do I'll be judged accordingly by God on the day when I die.  I want to have a wicked crown when I get to heaven haha maybe not wicked cuz wicked is from hell:P just awesome and yea man I wanna get myself treasures in heaven.  I wanna live this thing for God:).  Man I'd kill to here the words " well done my good and faithful servant":) that'd be soo soo amazing.  This has been long soo far but keep reading:P...  God has my life in his hands now...I'm given myself to him. I wanna live by the spirit and bye what he wants.  God kicks Satan butt. The chorus of one thing by Finger 11 is killer to describe what I feel:  If I traded it all If I gave it all away for one thing Just for one thing If I sorted it out If I knew all about this one thing Wouldn’t that be something  Like Man i wanna trade it all away for one thing...It's tough tho  I'm sick of my living tho soo it's my only option and I know it's the right one cuz I feel the holy spirit telling me to give myself away to God and trust him.  Alright guys that's a lil peek into my life I know it's long but comments are great:) I hate joke comments:P...Unless u can really make me smirk then I'm fine:)  GOD BLESS YOU ALL and to all a goodnight:P  Oh yea...guys if ur up for the bible study tell me...I wanna arrange a couple meetings this summer for it(y) Adios

      Today was pretty rad:D it was the last day of school and I finally finished exams and yea I hung out at Lorne's for awhile with some people then I went to uth. Wow I'm tired:S not just physically, but mentally and spirituallly. School has been a drain on my mind...cuz I had to finish alot of hw.  I'm sick of all the on going battles inside me:S.  Man Jesus called us to be either hot or cold and right now I'm just sitting in one place.  My pastor said there's no such thing as staying in one spot because it's an uphill battle, soo if ur doin nothing ur only goin downhill.  I'm soo spiritually hungry right now...I need to have my tank filled.  Man I want Jesus soo badly right now.  I'm soo lost with the friends situation:S I have no clue what goin on.  I want Jesus like crazy, but it makes it hard when the friends who were all going for God kinda ditch u and then u haveta become friends with all these people who rn't too into the things of God.  I've worried about friends alot this past semester of school.  It's taken alot of my mind off of other things.  Now I'm just putting it into God's hands and waiting.  There's nothing I can do.  W/e I try to make happen I botch it up.  I need the Lord to help me in all things:).  I'm sooo glad it's summer now...finally I can take a moment to breathe:P and just think about what's goin on.  I wanna get my life totally in sink with what God wants.  It's gonna be tough to do.  I just need God to provide me with some awesome friends again like I had b4....:PIn these stupids blogs I've talked bout how I want to live for God and stuff and all and I meant it, but I haven't changed much since and i want a dramatic change to happen.  Something soo dramatic that people will recognize I'm a christian by only looking in my eyes.  I want Jesus written all over me. :S I'm tired of lukewarm living. I'm tired of ups and downs and I'm tired of worrying about my future when God has control.  I need to live christ.  Man:s the battle is insane.  Be praying for me :) I need as much of it as I can get.  I want to learn my life purpose and what God has planned for me and what direction I'm supposed to head.  I'll pray for anyone who sends me a prayer request:D just email it to me.  Whoever did the Bible study or worship thing with me...Do u guys wanna do that again sometime??? that was cool.  Like...Mark, Joel, Steph, SOnja, Nicole, umm Lorne haha whoever reads this and who's up for it we should do something.  Anyways God Bless You All and COmments are great:) haha especially when u don't put it anonymous(y) Anonymous ones suck:P  Haha gosh this is long cya later

      Wow! summers almost here:D!!! It's wicked.  Gosh man Life's changing soo rapidly...Man I kinda got a slew full of different friends.  Haha I don't know what happend with all my friends:S...It's kinda a bummer letting go of alot of them. But they don't seem to miss me or nothing.  I've been trying to be more real with myself:)...and it turns out that if I'm real with myself I'm not all that great of a person haha  actually crappy is a better term...It's almost like I saw myself like alot without God and I realized like man the real me without God is terrible and I gotta have him fully in my life.  :S I'm talked soo much bout living this totally for God but man it's been tough:S.  I'm doing fine...Like I'm not off the target...I know what's the truth and now I'm heading towards it with more intensity then I have been.  I get caught up alot of the time with Self- rightousness and Spiritual Pride and that's cuz I am striving for God:S...Idn Mr.Kennedy talked about how striving for God isn't what we should be doin it's more like we gotta live by the spirit and like that's how in turn we'll get close to God.  It's not like u keep up living a moral life and u get close to God.  That's what we all buy into.  we all end up trying to "live for Christ" yet we just basically limit oursleves to some dumb rules and crap and we don't go anywhere:S.  Man we gotta live this for Christ but the way we do it is living by Faith and living by the Spirit.  God rocks...but don't limit yourself:)...U'll always fall short with Stupid rules.  Just live by the spirit and let the holy spirit decide choices for u.  Thinking bout it that way I think it's rad cuz it's almost like God is making decisions for u:D haha that's awesome.  Haha he could make u something way better than u make yourself.  Give ur all to him.  Don't be afraid:)...that's what Satan wants.  Don't give in to the thought that God doesn't have ur best intentions in mind.  God bless u:)and if could comment that'd be great...And if u comment I'd like it alot if u put your name to it:)

      Oh man it was awesome outside today:D!!! It was soo sunny and beautiful:).  I got out early today and soo I just basically did homework till lunch time then I went out to mcdonalds and then came back and did more hw:P.  I'm really trying to boost my marks up in this final stretch and do all the assignments I've missed.  I've been pretty busy with that and I've been kinda tired from staying up too late:P.  Life with God is pretty good...I've told about what I want and who I want to be in Christ and now I haveta walk it out.  Reflecting Christ's image is tough cuz man he's perfect...but that's kinda my aim to just have Jesus written all over me:).  I've said this lots like who I wanna be in christ...but I haveta fully take action and just give my all.  Sometimes It's hard to give ur all and I'm really working on it.  Satan just grips us with fear:S and he's makes us pretend to be things we're not and makes us live in insecurity and fear of our future.  Giving your all to God frees us from the fear and being afraid what's goin to happen.  Man...ANother thing that's kinda bumming me out is how fake everyone is:( It's just soo lame.  I just rather people be who they really r and not put on fronts.  I rather people not say they're christians if they don't even want God until like it's uth group or something and they put on a front "o I'm tight with God" but really they're not close to God at all.  People all deserve a chance don't get me wrong...but if u rn't even trying there's no point in faking it.  Live life like there's no tomorrow.  Do this thing for Christ:).  Be the real u whoever that might be.  Don't feel pressured into christianity.  If ur not real about it either get real or just be the person who u really are acting like out of church and out of the christian groups.  Be the person u'd be like when u hang out with Non- christians...cuz then that's more where ur heart is and it's less fake.  I want u guys to all go for God.  But be real:)  God bless u all and guys if u ever need prayer I'll pray for anyone just send me prayer requests or something:D take care
