      Springtime.  It may be on the way...  Today on the weather channel I saw that it is going to be 50 degrees and Sunny! I don't know about anyone else but I am feeling a Springtime itch. The wintertime blues hit me a little hard on Tuesday of this week, so I am looking forward to a nice weekend to liven my spirit a bit.  Speaking of the weekend...  I am pretty psyched for it because I am traveling to Bowling Green. I LOVE Bowling Green. It's always to hard to leave when I go back for a weekend. Sometimes I can't believe that I feel this way because as a Freshman, I hated BG. I went home (Clyde, Ohio) every weekend. Slowly and surely, however, it began to grow on me. The summer between my Junior and Senior year, I stayed in BG for summer classes and after that summer, BG became my home.  I can't express in words how hard it has been to move away from everything that I have know for 4 1/2 years of my life. It chokes me up just thinking about it.  I miss walking around campus. For anyone that is thinking about attending BG, I will tell you know that our campus in so beautiful in the Fall. There is nothing that I would love more that to be able to take a walk around campus every evening when all the trees are changing, and the sidewalks are full with students. Even though there is life and excitement, it's also really peaceful. I also miss the Student Recreation Center. I taught aerobic there for 3 years. The REC is where I lived. I LOVE that place. The smell, the people...and on a quick sidenote. BG has the best Group Exercise program in Ohio. I know this because I have taught at Kent State, Twinsburg and now Bedford Ohio and the level of teaching and the level and competence of instructors is unsurpassed.   I also am a big fan of BW 3's and even though Jon and I have found that the one in Kent is pretty good, BG's rocks out. On the weekends they have this guy playing acoustic and singing. He is freakin amazing! It is SO much fun to go out in BG. Two places (Nate and Wally's and Howards) have awesome Live Music...and that's something I haven't come across in Kent. Well, Jon and I did see one band, but they were horrible.  I could go on and on and on. I look forward to each time I go home to soak up everything that I love about Bowling Green.  Thank God it's Friday and I'm going home.

      Today I want to talk about the Atkins Diet.  As a fitness professional, you can imagine the questions I get about diets and dietary habits. First and foremost I will tell you that my position is and will always side with the Food Guide Pyramid and moderation. Secondly, let me tell you a little bit of my personal background with diets.  A long, long time ago (great beginning to an awesome song) I use to be overweight. In Junior High I stood at a mere 5'1" and weighed 200lbs. Yeah, I was an apple. I was also a cheerleader. Not to be egotistical or anything, but even though I was fat, I had the best jumps on the squad. Anyways, let's fast forward to my Freshman year in High School. For Homecoming all of the squads (Frosh, JV and Varsity) cheer together for that game. So, I'm cheering my heart out, per usual, when I hear a cheer coming from a small crowd of boys..."You're fat, clap clap, Lose Weight." I can tell you that I cried. I can also tell you, that very moment in my life lead to a dramatic change and I started starving myself. So long story short, I became so thin that I suffered from amenorrhea for over 6 months. What that means to me is that I have a higher risk of osteoporosis and I may not be able to ever have children, even if I wanted any. I also have to take birth control pills in order to regulate my hormones and have my periods monthly (Sorry if that was too graphic for any of you). Additionally, it has taken me a long time to get back to normal. I screwed my mind and body up. This is why I hate Diets.   So let's talk about Atkins. The hype is so huge that restaurants are now offering "Atkins Friendly" items to their menus. Cozwallop to boot, if you ask me (and Rubuis Hagrid). You may be asking, what's your point. This is my problem with Atkins. Ketosis, and what it does to your body. Having your body messed up, in anyways, totally sucks. As I explained above. You want my reason for hating Atkins? Well here it is:   "Ketosis is the presence in the blood of abnormally high levels of acidic substances called ketones. The normal body fuel is glucose. Ketones are produced when there isn't enough glucose in the bloodstream, and fats have to be used. When fats are used excessively as fuels, they are eventually converted to ketones. The real danger in ketosis is that ketones are acidic, and high levels of ketones make the blood abnormally acid" (NHS Direct Online).  You may be asking, so what? Um, do you know what acid is? The stuff that can eat holes through metal? You know, acid? Do you really think you want that in your blood? I think not. Additionally, high protein diets cause halitosis and kidney stones. I am thinking that all this stuff does not sound like fun.  Can I also point out that after any diet, when you go back to "normal," you are going to gain back everything you lost! Fitness is not just a quick fix with Atkins or some other diet. Fitness is a Lifestyle. This is why I love the Food Guide Pyramid. This is why I am an advocate for the Dole-5-A-Day Program and regular exercise. The way you live needs to be something you can live with! Moderation people! Ice cream is not your enemy! Nothing is! Before you can decide to make Fitness your lifestyle, you have to be ready to accept who you are. Not an easy task. So please! Get off the Atkins, the South Beach Diet, the Metabolife WHATEVER! Do me a favor and give yourself a big hug and make a promise to yourself to make a healthier lifestyle.

      Thank God it's no longer Manic Monday.  Yesterday I experienced what may be the busiest day at a YMCA, ever. A new session started yesterday, which meant parents scrambling to get their kids signed up for programs. This also meant that all of the staff members would need their best fake smiles and patience to deal with rudeness.  Let me ask you a question.  Have you ever yelled at a Customer Service Representative because you couldn't find a place to park? This happened to me yesterday. I was helping out at the Front Desk and what do I get for my good deed? A lady telling me off because she couldn't find a place to park. I had to look down at my name tag to make sure it didn't say "parking officer." Nope. Sure didn't. Just my name. I really wonder what this lady wanted be to say to her. Maybe,          "I'm so sorry that you couldn't find a place to park. It's entirely my fault. Let me give you a parking space with you name on it. No, I don't have a space with my name on it and most likely due to your whiney ass I am going to have to park across the street. Is this acceptable with me? No. I work so that I can give all my privileges as an employee to you. Thank you very much, fucker."  Of course I wouldn't say that, but trust me, that's is exactly what I was thinking.  Why has the general public become so angry? I think people forget that certain places they go to be "served," those service people are there to serve them because, here's the punch line. Wait for it...IT"S THEIR JOB! Take fast food restaurants for example:  Customer: "Yeah, I want a...a...Big Mac.  Fast Food Employee: Would you like fries with that?  Customer: No  Fast Food Employee: Would you like anything else today?  Customer: No  Fast Food Employee: Okay, your total will be (cost of Big Mac here).  Customer: I told you I wanted that in a combo! (obviously pissed)  Okay...what is wrong with the scenario? In no shape or form did the Customer tell the Employee they wanted a combo. But this happens all the TIME! (Trust me I have worked at McDonald's AND Wendy's) Where was a thank you? Where was, I'm sorry...could I have that in a combo please? This doesn't happen just at Fast Food Restaurants. It happens EVERYWHERE! (No wonder people hate their jobs so much!)  WAKE UP AMERICA! (Shout to Bernie Mac right there)  So next time your pissed about something unrelated to the person who is dealing WITH YOU, remember, they want to like their job, so be nice! Say Thank You! Maybe even smile (a shocker!). I bet you'll even feel better about yourself.

      It Starts...  You think you know someone...  This is a little piece of my world.  I am currently 22 years old. On June 22nd, I will yet turn another year older. My birthdate being the date that it is, has rendered me a Cancer/Gemini Cusp. Which will most undoubtedly prove to all of you that yes, I do have three personalities. I think you'll find this quite an amusing aspect to my entries. Of course, my sense of humor is a little off so maybe (hopefully) you'll find this amusing as well.  I work at a YMCA as a Fitness Coordinator. So you can say, the a 4-year degree and 4 years experience in the Fitness Industry qualfies myself as a mid-level Fitness Guru. Work and my days at my Alma Mater, Bowling Green State University, has brought to my attention that my idea of health (which I do believe to me correct) and society's (undoubtedly due to the Media) views of health do not coincide. So, I decided to start this Blog to shoot some of my opinions out to all of you (and because my boyfriend has one and I just think it's pretty darn neat).   Mostly you'll find that I will rant and rave about how I think the Media screws us all up and to talk about my life, of course. I hope to write often, but most likely it won't be as often as I would like. I currently do not have the internet at home (shocking, I know). But, check back regularly. Hopefully you'll walk away NOT wanting to even think about the Atkins Diet and other forms of bodily torture again.  That said...  Thanks for stopping by and enjoy your day here at...No, it's not Cedar Point, but do have a nice ride!

      I was sitting here trying to think of something that fires me up to talk about today. Lucky for you, I remembered something I really would like to talk about.  Safety.  First, I have been an AFAA (Aerobics and Fitness Association of American) for five years now. I have put my certification into practice and have upheld the integrity of the world-renowned certification. I am very proud of this. With each class I teach, I follow the guidelines of the AFAA 5 Questions. (read more about AFAA at http://www.afaa.com)  These 5 Questions are VITAL for the safety of any aerobics class. As a refresher, they are:  1. What muscle are you trying to lengthen and/or strengthen?  2. Are you doing that?  3. Is the back protected? Are there any other stress points?  4. Who is this exercise appropriate for?  5. Can you complete the exercise for 8 repetitions and maintain proper form and alignment?  Pretty good, right? Something that you would hope every aerobics instructor thinks about when putting together his or her class.   So why am I so fired up? Because various magazine fitness editors disregard any sense of safety. I read Shape, Fitness and Self magazine pretty regularly. I have written to each of their fitness editors about safety concerns (some more than once) with a certain exercise they insist on including in their magazines. Mountain Climbers.          (*Mountain Climbers are performed in the up position of a push-up. You hold that position and then bring your knees up one at a time like you are running.)  I hate mountain climbers.  Here's why: 1. What muscle are you trying to lengthen and/or strengthen?      I guess you could say the legs.   2. Are you doing that?      Are you adding resistance? No, so really, what are you doing?  3. Is the back protected? Are there any other stress points?      NO! DANGER! Also, major joint stress on the wrists and shoulder joints.  4. Who is this exercise appropriate for?      A competitive athlete, maybe. An aerobics class or fitness magazine? NO!  5. Can you complete the exercise for 8 repetitions and maintain proper form and alignment?      I don't think this is possible. If you are trying to "run," how many people do you think are trying to do this motion correctly?  I am just APPALLED that any magazine's Editor would let something like this be printed. If you have a basic fitness magazine, where you KNOW beginners are going to picking it up and saying, "Hey, I'm going to try this," safety MUST be your first priority. Here's something I would like to know:  Who is the heck are these fitness editors, what are their credentials and why don't I have their job?  UHG!  Lastly I would like to give props to the Editor-in-Chief at Self Magazine for her response to my concern, is as follows:  " Dear Brandi:  Thank you for your comments concerning our December 2003 Body Bonus  article. We've forwarded your e-mail to the appropriate editors, so you can be  sure that your voice has been heard.  We appreciate your interest in SELF and your taking the time to write."  Dear Self, Fitness and Shape,  I'm watching you.

      Turning Signals.  Everybody has them, not everyone uses them. This, drives me crazy.   This may be my only and biggest pet peeve. Not only is it irritating, it's dangerous. Currently I live outside of Akron and a hop, skip and a jump from Cleveland. People drive like assholes anyway. My most favorite thing in the world is when I am driving on I-480 and someone decides to change lanes in front of me. All I ask for is a little brake check and a quick snap of the wrist to flip on the turning signal. Unfortunately, I usually just feel like I might have a heart attack and die.  This might bother me even more. When Cops don't use their turning signals.  So, yes we all (everyone that drives) know that the lack of turning signal use happens all the time. But why? We all had to go to drivers education and last time I checked, turning signals are not an optional accessory.   What else bothers me? Why have some drivers forgotten how a 4-way stop works? I'm not even going to explain it because it makes me so disgusted.  Turning signals. Another time it really sucks when someone forgets to use theirs is when you're out on a run. With the weather getting warmer, I have been known to go for a run from time to time outside. I have been running for about 8 years now, so I would say I have a little experience with it. I love it when I'm getting ready to cross the street and I stop because a car is coming and then they all of a sudden turn. That pisses me off. Thanks for getting me out of the zone. haha...did I say love...I meant loathe.  Road rage...Running rage...maybe this would all disappear if turning signals because less of an option to drivers. I ALWAYS use my turning signal...it's way fun!  Everyone should try it.

      Now you cab take a magic pill each day to keep you slim, trim, beautiful and happy!  Now, just read that first sentence again. Doesn't it sound a little too good to be true? Yet, millions of American's would sell their most prized possession to get a monthly supply. Even if the name Anna Nicole is attached to it. So here comes the real question...why are we always looking for a quick fix?  Everything this day in age is all about quicker, faster, better. Fast food restaurants, DSL internet connections, driving...I could go on and on. Sadly dieting is no expection here. Why is this sad you may ask? The faster I lose weight the better. But let me ask you...for what cost?  "Magic Pills" (a.k.a Diet Pills) are bought by millions of American's, leaving the weight loss industry with millions of dollars. Maybe I should just buy a bunch of wholesale vitamins, put them in a new bottle that says "Flubber Flush" and collect my cash. I bet people would by it. All I have to do is put some false little pictures of heads that don't belong to the  body they're on with their touching testimonial. Leaving consumers with the impression that this pill will make them look like a brick shithouse.   MISCONCEPTION!  Diet pills can be very dangerous to your health. Not only can they be addictive, but sometimes the bottle isn't all that clear about it's ingredients. (You may of heard this about Dexatrim) Ma huang, also know as ephedrine, has been linked to serious side effects such as; heart attack, stoke and even death (to read more about Ma huang and it's dangers visit: http://www.yourlawyer.com/practice/overview.htm?topic=Ma%20Huang).  Let me just say that use of such aides is basically an afterthought to a weight loss plan that is going to work in the long-term. Without eating healthy and adding exercise to your daily life, you are just spinning your wheels in a never-ending roller coaster of weight lost and gained back (Being a yo-you must really suck).  If you are even THINKING about taking diet pills or any other weight loss supplement, please do your research. Better yet, just go take a walk outside and enjoy being able to just take a walk. There a many American's that can't even get out of bed.   Lastly, remember...those last 5 pounds never hurt anyone. Besides, I look at them as a blessing that you have enough to eat.

      I hate growing up.  I once thought that once I graduated with a college degree that I would be making $30,000 a year and my life would fall perfectly in place with what I wanted. Then I graduated. None this happened.  It's been pretty hard being smacked with "the real world." The state of the economy doesn't help either. Jobs are few and far between and the ones that are out there require worldly experience. In the past 10 months, I have moved twice and had three different jobs.   First I graduated and had NO idea what I wanted to do, as most college graduates do, and freaked out. I decided to go back to school. So I moved in with my friend Cricket in BG and started to work at Wendy's. I hated everyday of my life that I went to work at Wendy's. Somedays, I just didn't go. To make a long story short, I decided against going back to schoolthat found a job in Twinsburg, Ohio. A part-time fitness position I could make a little more money with and use my major. So in August, I moved to Stow, Ohio to pursue "career dreams." I worked in Twinsburg to the end of 2003 due to an accepted position at a YMCA as a Fitness Coordinator. A step up, full-time AND benefits. Don't get me wrong, I like my job. What I don't like is being away from Bowling Green, away from home and away from my friends. This sucks my ass.  So what comes along to throw Plan A out the window? This:  Jon and I took a wonderful walk through campus and downtown on the beautiful afternoon we had on Sunday. As we walked on campus I just became so sad. Thoughts, memories and feelings just overflowed inside of me. I missed my home. I missed my friends. I missed my family.   Being a nice day, tons of people were out and about and I miss that. Stow is ok, but I've only seen my next door neighbor about 5 times, he never leaves his apartment, and the people above me seem to never leave and never sleep. I miss people. I miss being in a place that is alive. I miss being close to my family and friends. Where I live now, I have nothing, no one. I sit alone at night and try not to think about how lonely I am.  Walking around campus and through town made me realize how much I wanted to be back home. I just keep thinking about it, all evening. I finally cracked when Jon and I were driving to see "50 First Dates" (Great movie, by the way). All I could tell him is that I don't know exactly what I want to do, but I do know that I want to move back to Bowling Green in August. I think he's really, really excited about this because he loves BG more that I do, and I love BG a whole lot. So right now, all I can think about is, how am I going to make this ok? How are my parents going to react when I leave a full-time job with benefits behind to come home? For the most part, I think I should be ok to find a job. I'm interested in working with Seniors and special needs and people who are interested in that are hard to come by. There are lots of YMCA's in the area as well that I can always start off part-time at working at the Front Desk or anything like that. Graduate school is also an option for the Spring.  I'm so impatient that I just want this all solved now. I just want to know what is going to happen. I want to move and find a new job. I want this but I know I can't have it until August, which sucks. Thank God Jon is my polar opposite in this arena, so he'll be a big help.  I just hate all this change and the stress that comes with it. I have been a big stress ship these past 10 months. I know this because when I come home, it goes away. By the end of the weekend, my jaw stops popping and I feel so happy I want to cry. Every time I come home, I never want to leave.   I hate being a lost twenty-something.  So, how does it end? "I don't know...it's a mystery" (Shakespeare in Love).

      Yeah. I want to talk about food.  I love food. Food is good. If you've read my archives you'll see that for a period of time I didn't eat very much food at all. However, now that I am over that period in my life, I enjoy food without guilt and hatred.   I don't understand people when they come to me and we start talking about their diets and they drop this bomb on me, " I don't eat bread." This angers me. Why, you ask?   Well, there's this process called digestion that breaks down what one eats so that it can be absorbed into the blood stream (read more about the digestion process at: http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/yrdd/index.htm). Just as people are picky in what they like to eat, so are the cells that absorb nutrients from the food in our blood stream. Especially when it comes to brain tissue and muscles. The cells that comprise these organs and tissues love glucose. Glucose is a digestion by-product of carbohydrates. Carbohyrdrates are foods such as vegetables, bread, rice, pasta and potatoes (read more about carbohydrates at: http://www-library.net/sites/framer?/sites/carbohydrates_in_nutritionist). So in order it get the needed glucose that everyone needs, you have to eat carbohydrates.  Why would you deny yourself needed nutrients that your body NEEDS to function properly.  What some people may be confused about are the different types of carbohydrates. There are complex carps and simple carbs, or sugars. The type of carbohydrates one eats is of high importance. Complex carbohydrate foods like bread, noodles, rice and veggies take longer to be digested than simple carbohydrates do. Simple carbohydrates, sugars, are digested quickly and easily. Simple carbs are food such as cake, candy and soda. Fruits are also sources of simple carbohydrates.   The best type of carbohydrates to incorporate into a diet plan are the complex carbohydrates. It's not that you can't eat fruit or treat yourself or that you should only eat carbohydrates. Everything in life should be taken in moderation, food, drink, etc. The people that claim to not be able to eat bread or pasta are denying themselves a vital life nutrient. Everyone can eat bread, everyday. One has to be smart and use moderation. This is hard for some people and this is where a big lesson is self-control comes into play. I mean come on, do you really want to avoid bread and pasta and everything that is yummy for the rest of your life? That's not even living!  What people have to understand is the body can only use so much glucose at one time. So when the cells have extra they save it. Then it's stored in the "fridge," the liver and muscles, and is called glycogen. Glycogen hangs out and when exercise is performed, or go when there are long periods without eating, it is used to produce energy. But, if one sits on your butt all day the glycogen becomes impatient and turns into fat (by the way, this can happen no matter what you eat, carbohydrates, proteins or fat).  What does this teach us? Carbohydrates don't make us fat. Sitting on our butts and eating too much of ANYTHING makes us fat.  The only diet that American's need to learn in the self-control diet! Come on people, let's get real!

      Last week I got into my first car accident.  It sucked.  Where I live, in lovely Stow Ohio, it snows ALL the time. I really was hoping no more snow would fall, but when I woke up last Tuesday, there was ten inches of snow outside.   Needless to say, the roads were a mess and I had to go to work.  So...out I went and right when I got onto route 8, boom.  It was crazy. First a huge red 4x4 truck started to do a 360 in the left lane. Then a U-Haul ( I hate U-Haul by the way) started to slide from the middle lane to the right lane (lane I was in). So the driver in front of me started to try to get out the way, followed by myself...but I hit a big patch of ice and instead of avoiding the car in front of me, I rear-ended it.  A little background about my car.  It's a 1996 Ford Contour that my parents got at a repo auction. It also had a huge dent on my passange side back seat door...due to a former accident. My car also had over 155,000 miles on it. So...this accident did not fair too well for it. Long story short, I now drive a sweet 99 pontiac sunfire.  Did I mention I have the best parents in the world? Yeah, they totally helped me get this car.  I hate snow.

      Health: 1. The freedom from disease or abnormality 2. The conditioning of optimal well-being, concerning ecological areas of health  I thought I would open with the definition of health to introduce today's topic of choice. How the media affects the images of the ideal body in society.  If you flip through popular magazines such as Cosmo, Glamour and Redbook, you'll find many advertisements depicting females in a very different light than when you would just walking down the street. Bone thin models posed in often times vunerable, provocative positions. Very lean and muscular young men in position of superiority to women. Psychologists are concerned with the exposure of these images to society. Studies from various University's have found that after looking at a fashion magazine, where pictures of these thin young men and women are advertised, test subjects reported less satisfaction with their own bodies. Thus, many young teenagers are pre-empt to develop eating disorders and poor body image.   Think about it, when only 10% of the population looks like the images we see everyday, everywhere, it's no wonder so many people fall prey to such disorders.   This is where I have the biggest problem with the images that are displayed to society. 10%, not 90%, not even 50% of people in our society look like these models, actors and actresses.  Yet, everyday, we are judged upon and compared to these unrealistic "norms" of "society." The media is trying to define health. But if you scroll back up to the top and read the two definitions of health I have listed, are these bone thin people healthy? Should we as a society accept these images as a definition of health? NO! But still, every single one of us falls victim to this "definition." How? Abnormality. This is their loop hole. The reason the media allows us to believe their definition as fact is that word. Everyone else who does not look like these people (10% of the population, mind you) are "abnormal." Fat, is abnormal? Curves are abnormal? Being healthy, is abnormal?   BUT WHY?  Why do we want to look like this? Is this sexy? Is this normal? (Can I please say again that only 10% of our population looks like this) When and why did the size of our body, clothes, nose etc. start to define WHO we are as a PERSON! I think some of the ugliest people I have met have been extremely thin. Why? Because they have very thin or just a horrid personality. Is that how we are all suppose to be? Angry, bitching thin people that just need to go eat a hamburger? I don't know about anyone else, but I like to go eat a hamburger when ever I want.   Personally, I would like to lose about 5 pounds, but then I think why? These 5 measly pounds just mean that I have enough to eat. That I'm happy. That I like to live a little. One day, I hope that everyone in the world can think like this. Variety is the spice of life. Everyone has different genetics. That means no ones booty is suppose to be the same!  I could go on and on about this, but I think I'll just wait till I write my book.  I hate the media.

      BG.  I just had a GREAT weekend home.   After work on Friday I drove to BG for the first weekend home in I can't remember how long. The sun was shining, I had a good day at work...life was good. That evening, Jon and I met up with Cricket (old roomie and dear friend) for dinner at SamB's. It was so nice to see her and get to chat about what has been going on in life since I'm never around anymore. We had very nice meals and drinks and then parted our separate ways. Jon and I then ventured to BW's where I ran into a guy I had almost every class with at BG.   This is where it gets really good.  He works at the private club up in Toledo and gave me his card...long story short:  He is going to make sure my resume goes to the right people.  Boo-Yah.  On to Saturday...  On Saturday I had dinner with my other very good friend Rachel. We were roommates our Freshman year, we actually went to High School together. But then she got married, so we couldn't live together anymore. Thank God that's over for her though. She's much happier without that crazy dude.  Sunday was the day I got to spend the most time with Jon...and it was very nice. I'd actually like to take a moment to send a shout-out to him. See, I have the BEST boyfriend in the world. It's crazy...I really don't deserve a guy like him and I don't know who I scored points with to actually be with him, but whoever it is...I love you man.  Jon makes every weekend together special and memorable. There's never a moment that passes by that I don't know how glad he is to have me here with him, how much he loves me or how special I am. There are not too many people like this in the world...so Jon, I hope you know how much you mean to me. I love you with all of my heart and I hope you do keep me forever. I love you.  Whew, need to wipe some tears!  Anywho.  On Sunday, Cricket had her senior recital. It was lovely. She conducted and sang about 20 pieces. The whole experience really choked me up. See, I was suppose to be in music school right now...and if I would have been, I would have been singing in her chamber group. I almost cried because I can't believe how stupid I was to not go through with it. Music has been something I have wanted to do since High School. I just have never gotten around to it due to: 1. The money 2. The money 3. I don't have enough confidence in my voice. However, you never know that the future will bring. I know there is further schooling ahead of me and what that might be, it's a mystery as of yet. But, I do know that last night had a big effect on me. There are a lot of decisions that I made last May that currently I am not to happy with myself about. There were other people involved in some of them and I hope they know how truly sorry I am for all the stupid shit I did.  On to Checkers...the townie bar.  Karoke :)  Yeah...I saw so many people that I love and miss and it was SO great.   I don't want to leave home today, at all.  Life sucks.

      Job searching.  I feel like this all I have done for the past year. Right now I am job searching because I hate my current job and I live 2 hours away from everyone that I want to be around. Not that 2 hours is too far, but it is when none of your friends and family come to see you. The only person I see regulary is Jon. If it weren't for him, I would of shot myself by now.  Did I mention I hate my job?  I actually don't hate my job, I have my boss. He's the stupidest man I've ever met in my life. Everyday, it becomes more relevant to me when I talk to people if they went to college or not. I'm not saying just because you go to college you are above everyone. However, while at college the majority of students learn how to communicate and function as a normal piece of society. You can have a good conversation with a well-education person. This is the biggest gap I see. I'll start talking to some people and it's like they have no freaking clue what I'm or they are saying. They just stare at you with glazed over eyes. I get this from my boss all the time. I just look at him and wonder how in the hell did he get his job. It really pisses me off that I went to college for 4 years and there are people with no education out there holding jobs that people like me should have. I'm not saying that not everyone like this does a shit house job. I know there are people out there with no education that do awesome. What I don't understand is when people quit because of you, when programs are failing and unorganized and it keeps happening over and over again...how do these people keep their jobs? If I was the head hauncho...they would be so out of there.   You know what else bothers me...people with no empathy.  My senior group exercise class was talking about me (where I could hear) about how I do everything different from their last instructor. That really hurt. I have been comparted to this lady since I've got to the Y and that sucks my ass. You know, I know my shit. What we do in class we do for a reason. All they want to do is work on there chest muscles (for breathing problems). That's not how you get in shape! I work the entire body with them and they can't understand why. It just fustrates me that people do not TRUST my knowledge. For God's Sake I studied exercise for 4 years! I think I might know some stuff about it! This made me break down yesterday. I just want to say that I am not happy (have you noticed this is a vent blog?). I'm not happy with my boss, I'm not happy with my classes, I'm not happy living in Stow, I'm not happy being alone. I'm fucking not happy. And yet I bust my ass EVERYDAY to make other people happy. When is something going to happen to make me happy?!?!?!?  Sorry...I needed that.  Anyways. Next time you decide to talk about someone, I don't care if you do it. Just don't do it where the person might hear. Make sure they are gone for the day. And, if you have an employee that knows there shit, respect them for that and get off there asses. Help them grow instead.  Geez.

      I know someone famous!  All the way from the little town of Clyde, Ohio my fellow Clyde High School graduate, Tim Anderson, is now a professional football player for the Buffalo Bills.  I think that is way freaking cool.  Tim and I spent 2 years in the same math class with Mr. Moiser. From that experience I can tell you that we learned great math, learned a lot about football and had a lot of fun. I use to get teased a lot in that class (one time I asked for it because I told Mr. Moiser I saw a UFO). Tim also picked me up with one arm in that class...he's a big dude if you didn't notice.  Tim was always a nice, down-to-earth guy. He was friends with just about everyone in high school. He really deserves this and I am so happy for him.  One thing is for sure, everyone in Clyde is now a Buffalo Bills fan!  Timmaytahoe, I'm thinking about you buddy, congratulations!

      I went home to BG this weekend...I love going home!  This weekend was spectacular, so I had to write about it!  Friday was great because I got to see my step-mom for lunch (and her sweet new car) and my mom. I haven't seen my mom in a while. I also was able to get my hair done where I always do back home, which made me feel great. Then Jon took me to EasyStreet, my favorite place to eat in BG...which was so awesome. We got in a game of pool and some word/trivia games before we ate. It was just such a fun, low-key evening.  On Saturday, we went to see the Detroit Red Wings play. This was my first hockey game and it kicked ass. I  now like hockey a whole bunch. My favorite part is when they start fighting...that's way fun. I definitely want to go to another game next year...whether to be a BG game or a Toledo Storm have...good stuff.  However, the best part of the weekend came on Sunday. Jon took me to try on engagement rings. This, was WAY exciting for me! I found two rings I really liked and didn't want to take off...lol...it was a good time. Jon knew that I had been dreaming about doing this...he always makes my dreams come true.  Sunday evening Jon and I went for a walk around campus that I LOVE when we do that. I love being home so much and I can't wait till I am here to stay, with my baby!

      Today I listened to an archived broadcast of Dave DePew's Fitness and Nutrition hour. A friend/co-worker of mine from my days at BG, Doug Jackson, and now co-author of a new fitness book, "The Power of Champions," sent me the link to enjoy this broadcast. What I would like to write about are the top training secrets of fitness professionals. This list was given on the show, but I would like to expand a little bit more for anyone who might read this blog.  #1. Periodization.     Periodization is a fancy fitness word for planning. If you plan out your workouts for a week, you are planning what is called a microcycle of a periodization schedule. This is where we find our training splits: Back and biceps, chest and triceps, shoulders, legs, abdominals all trained on different days.  It is a wonderful thing to plan out weekly workouts to have efficiency and moreover active recovery in your workouts. However, while some people might plan out their weekly workouts, they do not look at a bigger picture.  The bigger picture in periodization is called a meso or macrocycle. Depending on the length. A mesocycle might last a few weeks to a month or so, while a macrocycle might last 6 month to a year. Why it's so important to look at the bigger picture is due to our next item on the list:  #2. Goals.     More importantly to have S.M.A.R.T goals. A lot of people come to me and say, hey Brandi I want to lose 20 pounds in about six weeks and have abs like Britney Spears. I think then my eyes bug out of my head. Sure, they have a goal, but it's a goal that they won't achieve and will most likely make them give up on exercise. So let's make this a S.M.A.R.T goal.  S=specific: This is our what, when, where, why and how. First off understand that 1-2 pounds of weight loss a week is considered safe. Next, you have to set up a workout plan that you can stick with. For most people working out six days a week is not going to happen. Lastly, have a good reason why you want to do this...hint, it shouldn't be just to look good in a bikini. So, to make this goal specific let's stick with the 20 pounds. But instead of 6 weeks, let's aim for 12 weeks, or 3 months. Then the person needs to set up a workout plan that's finds them in the gym 3 times a week working on cardiovascular exercise for 30 minutes every session, and strength training exercises for at least 20 minutes every other session.  M=measurable: This is easy enough. You can surely measure 20 pounds on a scale and moreover, any weight loss can be measured on how your clothes fit.  A=attainable: Can you do this...safely? This is why it's important to plan for a weight loss of 1-2 pound a week. It's also important to look at your body type. There are three body types: ectomorph(willowly), mesomorph(muscular), and endomorph(curvy). If your body type is something like a meso-endo combination, you are never going to look like a supermodel because your body is just not built that way. It's so important to know what you and your body is capable of.  R=reasonable: This means you can't possibly work out 7 days a week for 3 hours a day. It  means you can lose 20 pounds in 6 weeks. You have to be reasonable with yourself and not look for a quick fix.  T=timely: set a time goal...that again meet the rest of our acronym.  So, our goal before is to lose 20 pounds in 6 week and have abs like Britney.  After? To lose 20 pounds in 12 weeks by planning and doing a workouts that contain cardiovascular and strength training exercises for a combined time of 50 minutes 3 days a week.  Note, I didn't mention Britney because you do not ever want to compare yourself to someone else. You always want to be in the best shape for YOU!  #3. Find out what works and DO IT!     So if you do not like to run, don't do it. Do what you like, do what works for you and drop all other ideas.  #4. Eat like a champion     My favorite little story goes a little something like this:     Picture yourself as a pile of firewood. When you diet by restricting calories or not eating, fad diets, overexercising etc., you put water on your firelogs. Everyone knows you can't burn a fire with wet logs. Which means you can't burn fat and keep your motor running. When start doing to right things like eating right, exercising regularly and getting enough fluids, you start to dry out your firelogs. When you dry them out, that's the only time your fire will burn and you will get permanent results.  #5. Don't ignore the red flags.     If it hurts, don't do it. If you are feeling to tired, you need more rest. You have to know your own body, it's telling you something...LISTEN to it!  #6. Have a team approach.     Get a trainer, work out with a friend, go visit a nutritionist. Find out all the information you can to make it work for you!  Now go get to it!

      I am driving up eight five in the kind of morning that last all afternoon I'm just stuck inside the gloom  Four more exits to my apartment but I am tempted to keep the car in drive and leave it all behind.  Cos I...wander sometimes about the outcome of a still verdictless life  Am I living it right Am I living it right Am I living it right Why, why Georgia, why  Rent a room and I fell the spaces with wood and places to make it feel like home but all I feel's alone  It might be a quarter life crisis or just the stirring in my soul  Either way I...wander sometimes about the outcome of a still verdictless life  Am I living it right Am I living it right  Am I living it right  Why, why Georgia, why  So what do I've got a smile on it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head  Don't believe me Don't you dare believe me When I say I've got it down  Everybody is just a stranger but that's the danger of going my own way I guess it's a price I have to pay Still everything happens for a reason is no reason not to ask yourself if you are  Living it right Are you living it right Are you living it right Why, tell me why, why, why Georgia, why  This song speaks so much to me and it almost brings tears to my eyes. John Mayer is a talented singer/songwriter and he nailed this ever-so-common 20-something feeling!

      I want to talk about Morgan Spurlock.  For those of you that are on the up and up, you probably know who this is. If you don't, that's okay, I'm going to tell you.  Morgan Spurlock filmed a documentary. Big deal, you may be thinking...or even, ugh how boring. Whenever I hear documentary I tend to turn green. But this may be the one and only documentary I might ever be interested in. You see, for 30 days, Morgan Spurlock ate McDonald's three times a day for a full 30 days.                  (read more at: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4078903)  Why I am so intrigued by this is because this IS our society. I'm sure everyone knows at least one person that eats out for every meal of the day. You know...The drive through McD's at breakfast for a sausage and egg biscuit with a hashbrown...then for lunch they have a single with cheese and fries at Wendy's...and for dinner, Olive Garden for a big plate of Fetticine Alfredo.   You may be thinking...yeah, why don't you pick the worst-case scenario. But, I don't think sounds outlandish at all. You and I both know it happens. Let's not try to sugar coat it, if you please.   While I look at this made up food journal entry for a day, it does sound good...for ONE day. Personally, if I ate all of that heavy food, the next day I wouldn't be able to move, or eat. What I can't believe is that there are people who do this EVERYDAY, not just one. Moreover, they aren't practicing this lifestyle for just a month...but most likely for years! And here our society is facing an "obesity epidemic." And we all try to point the finger at something. There is no one to point the finger at but ourselves. There is NO reason to eat out three times a day. I don't know an apartment that isn't equipped with a fridge and stove...and I don't think I've ever been in a house that didn't have both as well. There's no argument about not having the money because if someone has the money to eat out three times a day, they DEFINITELY have the money to buy groceries. In fact,  they will most likely save money.  It just really bugs me that everyone always has to have a scapegoat.

      While it's great that this is the time of year it's gets a little warmer which allows you to get outside to play, it's also the season that causes a lot of people problems.   Allergies.  I should have know it was coming. I feel like poop.  You know, I really don't like going to the doctor now because each time it costs me $20. While that's cheap (especially to those who don't have insurance) it's money I don't really have. Health care, if you have insurance, should be free. I can't complain too much though, I know I have to take care of myself. I don't want to wake up one day, have to go the ER and find out I'm about to die.  It sucks that womean have to go to the doctor atleast one time a year. Guys never have to go unless there is a major problem..you know...that makes me think about how it pisses me off that birth control is not covered by insurance.   Birth control is far too expensive.  So is everything in this world.  Ugh...my nose hurts.

      I got my wisdom teeth out yesterday.  For the pain, I am taking Darvaset.  Dude...I'm spaced out.  I know that these drugs are known for people become addicted to them. I have no idea how you could want to feel this way. I feel like I have Narcolepsy! And I can't remember what I was thinking from time to time...I'll just be talking and then, nothing. I just stop and stare at the damn wall. I mean I'm glad that I can't feel too much pain due to these pills, but man I'll be glad once the pain is gone and I won't have to act like a freakin' blonde.  Okay I have to go because this when I start to loose my attention span.

       urlLink    Oreo, one of the cats Jon and I really like at the Humane Society.&nbsp; urlLink     Jon and I went to the Humane Society to visit the kitty cats today. I LOVE cats, so this always makes me happy. However, our visit wasn't that great today. When we arrived, there happened to be 5 million annoying kids in the cat room. The cats weren't that happy about these visitors either. A large majority of the cats were pissed off. To see why (and if you are interested in adpotion) visit:  urlLink The Wood County Humane Society  page.  You know, I was really looking forward to sitting there with a cat happily purring on my lap. But, the parent of these kids decided to not instill any rules to their children about how to act in a public place...and furthermore, how to appropriately handle animals.  There are a couple things I have learned about animals. Before you pet them you should let them sniff you and if they ever meow or swipe at you, it's best to leave them alone. Well...it so happened that everyone of these kids were holding a crying kitten. These even includes a two year hold, who in my opinion, had no business with a kitten for any reason. What pisses me off as that the mother did nothing. Obviously the kittens were NOT happy. Did that matter, NO! This (I am assuming) family, decided that they would piss off every cat and then any cat that wasn't pissed, they would hold so that anyone else that was there couldn't enjoy the animals or the enviornment at all.   Now, I am not entirely mad at the kids (although I do not particulary like kids), I am most upset with the mother. If I ever have kids, one thing for sure is that my two year old will not be walking around holding a kitten by it's neck as well as letting my other children run wild, bumping into other people and upset a particular environment.  What are wrong with parents today? Can't you control your damn kids so that other people can enjoy simple pleasures along with you? Do you know how to share? Do you know how to shut the hell up?  Sorry, I know this is a little harsh, but dammit, I wanted some kitty time too!

(The Reds vs. The Mets)Jon is a HUGE Reds fan and this game took place the day after his birthday (July 5th). Since then, I have grown to like the Reds a tad bit more than the Indians...mostly due to that the Indians SUCK and...I think Adam Dunn is hot!

      I totally had something picked out to write about today, but sadly I can't remember.  Let me sit and think for a minute.  Ah...oh well I guess I'll just do a play by play of some things that are on my mind.  1. The Y only paid me for one week this pay period. What the hell is that all about? How do you make that kind of mistake when you get paid, I don't know, $70,000 just to cut pay checks? If I made $70,000 I would make sure that everything I did was perfect, even if I made that much picking up dog shit.  You wouldn't see any dog shit around anywhere every again.   2. I had a night from hell yesterday. I teach Gymnastics for about 2 hours straight on Thursdays. I have to mention that my first class contains children ages 3-5. I have one thing to say, if your child will not listen to you, they certainly will not listen to me. If you think for one minute for putting them in Gymnastics when they have ADD and can't sit still will do any good... You're wrong. I feel like a damn fool running around after 3 year olds telling them to sit the fuck down when they don't even know what the word sit means. Before you take your child to any public place make sure they have gone through obedience training.  3. I am turning 23 soon. Not that 23 is a big deal, but damn 25 is creeping up there!  4. I have three job interviews next week. Over the past year I bet I have done at least 10 interviews, if not more. I have been looking for a job to move away from "hell on earth" (as I like to call it) since March. God Damn you George W. Bush.  5. I am voting for John Kerry.  6. I haven't been to the Lake yet. I was raised at the Lake. I am way too far away from my parents boat on the Lake. I am consumed with thoughts of going to the Lake.  7. Seven is one of my favorite numbers, so here's to 7 just for being great.  8. I have been severely stressed out this past year. Please read:  urlLink Stress and Weight Gain     Now the past year hasn't caused too many pounds to come on, but it has caused me to not want to exercise as much. Hence, my abs aren't what they use to be. However, I am about, I would say, 5-7 pounds away from what I use to be a couple of summers ago. I have found some new kind of motivation (putting in my resignation at the Y) to which I have been eating better and exercising more. I feel pretty damn good too.  9. My favorite author is coming out with a new book in September and I can't NOT wait! I read the first chapter of her new book on her  urlLink Blog . I am so stoked!  10. I got to take today off due to my near meltdown after last night's gymnastics events. Three day weekend, bitch!

      I got a job!  Whew! What a load off.  I have been talking to this place since March. I am never ever this patient when it comes to waiting things out. I'm quite impulsive, my parents, for one, are quite impressed with how I've handled myself and my relocation. Usually when I make a decision I just forget all consequences and do it. But for once, I decided to "do the right thing," and it's FINALLY paid off.  This club is sweet. It's called  urlLink Wildwood  and it's sooooo nice. I am very excited to start working there. I already know two people that work at the club from college. That will be nice. Jon is going to get a membership, which is awesome. They have spinning and yoga and loads of very nice equipment...I'm really excited to introduce him into some different realms of fitness. He works just a hop, skip and a jog from the club so hopefully we can workout together during the week.  On that note of Jon joining, their rates are really good. For Jon to join my free membership, he just has to pay the difference which will be $36 a month. That's cheaper than another club that I have visited in BG. It's almost the same price as a Y...which is crazy because you have to see this place. They have blow dryers and stuff for you in the locker rooms!   Anyways, I am quite excited because I get to come home. Jon and I need to clean up his place before I leave this weekend (and honey, it needs to stay that way) so I can start bringing my stuff over...and have a place for it. We have to wait until we get our place in August to bring my big stuff. I have to pay rent without really living there in August, but that's ok...I need to get back my deposit. And it will be nice to have extra time to move everything. Last time I had a U-Haul. I will never again drive a U-Haul...but it was nice to just have one trip. It won't be like that this time...oh well.  I didn't sleep much this week, so listen to what I did yesterday. When I got to BG, I slept from 4:30-10:15pm. Then I woke up for about an hour and went back to sleep and woke up at almost noon today. That is some crazy shit! But, I am feeling better...except for my damn back. I feel like I am 80 they way it has been acting up.  It's a really nice day here in BG. I love the bike trail here, so I am thinking a rollerblading trip may be on the agenda here soon.  Did I really just start feeling tired again?  ps. if you want to hear my U-Haul story, leave a comment that you do and I will put it up this weekend.

      I have more to say today. Yeah for all of you!  If you read  urlLink Jon's Blog , you can read more about what I am up to on the weekends. We had a fun weekend, even if I am STILL recovering from it.   I want to talk about Jon.  See, Jon is great. When I am with him I am just happy. I sit there with a big ol' goofy grin and think, "damn, I'm happy." And all we have to be doing is sitting there together for this to happen. Not saying anything, not even doing the same thing. Just there.   It's so great.  Jon always does everything he can to do little things for me. He did A LOT for me for my birthday this year. When he does all these nice things, without warning, I just feel like "wow, how do I deserve this?" All I need for him to do is to say I love you and mean it...but he does more than that (not that I'm complaining). It's so nice to have someone want to give you as much as they can. Especially when that's all you try to do for them. We have such a rewarding relationship in so many ways. Words can't even describe how wonderful I feel right now, trying to find the words.   Amazing.

      Today is my birthday! Yeah me!  I thought being that today is a celebration of another year, I would yet again do a top ten list. So without further adieu, here are my top ten lists for the best and worsts things about this past year (like I can go one day without being at least a tad bit negative).  Top Ten Things That Sucked: (you know, get it out of the way)  10. Going the ER room all by myself in September. It was really scarey.  9. My Cat almost died.  8. Working at Wendy's for the summer after I graduated from BG.  7. Not having cable for an entire year.  6. Not having internet access at home for an entire year.  5. Moving to Stow.  4. Getting a job at the Y  3. Not being able to have a cat at my apartment.  2. Not being able to work out at the REC anymore.  1. Graduating from BG. The real world sucks.   Top Ten Things That Ruled:  10. Not having homework.  9. Being able to read books that I want to.  8. My graduation weekend.  7. Teaching myself how to play the guitar.  6. Figuring out Home really is where my heart is.  5. Going to New Hampshire for FREE! Screw you Colby-Sawyer!   4. Football Season.   3. Becoming more acceptant of my body.  2. Meeting and falling in love with Jon.  1. Graduating from BG. It is an accomplishment to do it in 4.

      Today I am happy.  I have not felt this happy in a LONG time. It feels AWESOME!  Today was my last day at the Y. I actually had a good day, granted this hasn't been full of roses.  Recap of week:  Monday: Told my boss Friday would be my last day (put in resignation 3 weeks ago and complete communication about new job, moving etc, nevertheless) which he then proceeded to call me selfish and ungrateful as well as "fire" me. I was just pissed off. I shouldn't of left then, but I didn't. Yeah, I'm selfish and ungrateful alright.   Tuesday: Went out on a run and sprained my right ankle. Dammit.   Wednesday: Was actually an ok day, it just hurt to walk.  Thursday: My boss was unfortunately at work. Just the few words we exchanged irritated me, thus ruining my day. (Today I was told by a co-worker that my boss said he should fire me after gymnastics-is he for real? What an ass-fucker.)  Friday: Best day of my life in a few good months. I received flowers from Roxanne, balloons and a Card from Mr. John, hugs from all around and a good feeling inside. Mr. John also took me to breakfast. Adam and Mike where there as well. It was a nice time, just talking and saying goodbye.   There are people I will miss at the Y. It's really too bad that it didn't work out there. I originally planned on staying there for two years and then going to graduate school. If I stayed there for two years with my boss...Well, I would of never made it that long because I would of killed myself long before then.  Anyways, I plan on keeping in touch with those at the Y that touched my life and now truly hold a place in my heart. I even want to go back an visit...just as long as we all know who isn't there.  I am so excited to be going home...and this time I don't have to come back. I feel so damn happy I might explode.  Literally...I have to go pee.

      It's Sunday Morning.  It's excellent outside.  I ended up getting a nice little sunburn on my shoulders yesterday while out on the bike trail. Jon and walked out there for an hour. I even thought about sunscreen...well, at least it doesn't hurt, it's just really pink.  I have no motivation to really do anything yet. Working out, yeah I'd like to do that at some point. Start cleaning, yeah it can wait till later. Go outside, I'm too damn lazy to get up out of this chair. Jon is still sleeping. I promised I wouldn't wake him up today. Aren't I nice?  The Mud Hen's are in town today. We talked about going to see them play, but I don't think we will make it. They play at 2pm and it's after 11am...AND Jon is still sleeping...and we don't have tickets...lol   I got Jon Edwin tickets for his birthday. He plays at the Odeon on Friday. I am excited about it as well. We have been listening to his new CD in the car. It's really good. I can't get "Shooting Stars," or "Say Anything" out of my head. Very, very good songs.  Dude.  I don't know why I just wrote that, but I did. I'm a little out of it this morning. I'm not "speaking" in my usual voice. Shocking that I'm not always so vulgar, right?   I'm not right today.  Oooh.   Yesterday I got a nice French manicure. My nails look good. Then to top it off, I went into Claire's and got this sweet new ring and some new earrings. I also got my friend Rachel some bling. She graduate cosmetology school yesterday. We met up at Loma Linda's off AirPort Highway for food and margarita's. Very good margarita's there. It was a good time, fun and laughs. One of the girls that was there didn't really strike a "nice" face with me, but whatever. If you roll your eyes are me, fine...but don't let me catch you doing it because then I will hate you...lol...see there I am. ;)  Well, I think I am done just blabbing. So off I go.  Shit.  Had to get one in there.

      I am just sitting here thinking about things I could write about, what's hot, what's been in the news when it hit me...Britney Spears. The last couple of weeks she has been in the limelight for getting engaged to a Justin look-a-like, been suspected to be pregnant, and hurt her knee...which lead to the cancellation of her Onyx Hotel tour. I decided to check out her website where I found you can write her a "Get Well Soon" message.  Here is my message to Britney.  Dear Britney,  You are in need of serious therapy, as well as some serious singing lessons. You may have a good body, but there are a ton of other things that you don't have that makes someone a musician. You are not a musician my dear, you are a puppet. Learn how to actually play a legitimate instrument and actually write a decent song. (That means YOU have to actually do it, not have someone else do it and you fake it) Also, I think in therapy you might learn how to be your own person. This whole trying to be like Madonna and Janet isn't working. Maybe the time you take off from your "knee injury" can help you to actually put your "talents" in prospective. Face it, you suck and as for myself, I hope you never tour or make another album ever again.  Oh by the way, Get Well "Soon."  Write your own message at  urlLink "Get Well Britney".

      I love working out at the club.  They have SO many cool toys. My new favorite thing is the BOSU. It's this little contraption that is flat on the bottom and then the top is half of a resist-a-ball. Its main purpose is core/stability training. I tried out some squats (flipped it upside down so I am standing on the flat part) and I was SO proud of myself. I mentioned last week that I sprained my ankle, so I was a little hesitant about trying out this particular stunt.  So fun!  We also have this cool thing called "the functional trainer." It's this big column with two big bars that come out of it that rotate 360 degrees. You can place those "arms" in various degree positions and add resistance from a pulley system. Dude, it's sweet. I did this kinetic chain squat/upright row, and it kicked ass.  Did I mention I love working out there?  Oh yeah. They have this treadmill. It's like the Buddha of all treadmills. It goes up to 50% incline. That's like  45 degree angle from the ground, if not a little higher. That treadmill is freaking awesome! (Made by nautilus if you are interested)  Another words of note: I have re-wrote my training philosophy. It use to be "Fitness is a Lifestyle." But I have changed it to "Fitness is a Feeling." Why? I will tell you why.  You might have noticed that I have a problem with society and how they dictate/define "health." Fitness does have something to do with overall health, but it's not everything. When you talk about fitness, it's a feeling. If you are sitting there is your chair reading this, you know if you are fit or if you are not. Fitness has nothing to do with a certain shape or size. It's about feeling able. It's about feeling good about what you CAN do. It's not focusing about how you don't look or what you can't do and such things. Fitness is a Feeling!   I feel pretty damn good about my new statement.  I really want to start up an online Personal Training system. Basically for a small fee, I'll make up your weekly workouts. If you are interested, e-mail me at: frdmgir7@yahoo.com   Peace and love to ya brother.  In other words: I'm out like the anorexic girl at a pie eating contest.

      Well not exactly, but it was my first day at my new job.  Dude, it was awesome.  For the first job I have held since I graduated and could no longer work at the  urlLink BGSU Student Rec , I feel like I have a job that I am actually going to learn something from. This position is going to challenge me and I am going to be putting my degree and all my certifications to their proper use.  My parents can now be proud.  I am SO stoked.  I have been craving knowledge. Everyone at Wildwood is SO nice and they know a lot about what they do, and they are ALL really, REALLY good at it. This job is really going to help me grow as a professional and I am SO excited.  *SO* lol  On another very awesome note, Jon and I are now sharing a crib. It's going to be so very nice to see him everyday! All this has not really set in yet that I am actually HOME and I don't have to leave.   AND! I get to see my very best good friend Cricky and have some much needed porch monkey time.  This is THE life for me.

       urlLink This , cracks me up.  Here's a way to be a  urlLink Healthier You !  What is wrong with the paragraph?  "I came down with obesity two years after I got married," 41-year-old Oklahoma City resident Fran Torley said. "I know it was hard for my husband to watch me suffer from this disease. When he caught obesity a year later, he got so depressed, he couldn't do anything but sit on the couch. Some days, we sit and watch television from dawn till dusk, hoping for news of a breakthrough."   Um...most people don't catch obesity. Sure, there are people who have other disease that make them gain weight, but you don't just catch fat! Why are you fat? Because you eat too much and move too little!  I think that's all my brain has in it right now.

      I am teaching myself how to play the guitar.  F-U-N...sometimes.  I have a hard time with a lot of the chords yet, but I guess that's to be expected. I haven't been playing that long, so I guess it can only get better.  The purpose of this information is this:  I was looking up some guitar tabs today for some new songs. I like to play mellow stuff that I can sing a long to when I play. Sometimes I will look up a song and if it has too many chords I can't play I just skip it. Yeah...I'm still learning. That sucks too because I really want to pay "Don't Tell Me," by Avril Lavigne, but dammit, I don't know C# or some weird C chord that's not just C Major.   Anyways.  Jon has introduced me to lots of new music. The two artist that he mainly introduced me to are Edwin McCain and Angie Aparo. Angie is awesome...his range is freaking incredible. If you are looking for some chill the hell out music, get his new CD "For Stars and Moon." "The American" is also really, really good as well.(Check  urlLink Angie's  website out)  Ok.  So, Angie wrote the song "Cry," the song that Faith Hill made popular. I never knew that, I thought she wrote it.  Dude, I hate that.  The people that are popular is music, for the most part, don't write anything. I just feel like, why are you famous? You are NOT a musician!  Dammit.  Ps.  Why Angie Rocks and the Song you NEED to hear:  1. Cry (you need to hear him sing it) 2. Hush 3. She's Alright By Me 4. Caroline 5. The Water is Wide-sung with his mom

      The Seven Points that a personal trainer examines when you become their client to help you achieve your goals.  This was homework given to me by my boss...the data and person are totally fictional.  Case Study: Ellen Executive By: Brandi   1.	General Fitness and Limitations of Ellen. Limitations: Ellen suffers from low back pain, which I believe can be relieved to some extent through exercise. Her right knee was scoped 2 years ago, but she does not report any pain. However, the lack of pain does not signify a lack of injury and therefore will still be a concern when creating her workouts.  Additionally, Ellen is on a beta blocker due to high blood pressure. I will need a medical clearance from her doctor as well as a document that states at what heart rate range they would like her to work within. Hopefully, we will be able to lower Ellen’s blood pressure and she will be able to go off her medication due to regular exercise.  Ellen will need to progress very slowly due to her limitations as well as due to lack of activity. She has not worked out for about seven years and will need extra motivation in order to progress successfully through the behavioral-change model. It is very important that Ellen adopts an exercise habit and a healthier lifestyle. She is already at more of a risk due to her father dying from a heart attack at the age of 45. Fitness Level: Ellen’s fitness profile gives her a total fitness score that places her in the unfit category. Ellen is 5’3” and weighs 145lbs. Her body composition test came back to read 28%. This is not horrible, especially for her age. The place where Ellen will need the most guidance is in the strength and flexibility departments, where she scored very poorly. For being on medication, her blood pressure is still reading around 135/87. A normal blood pressure reading is 120/80, we will definitely need to keep an eye out. Additionally, her resting heart rate is around 82, which is kind of high for being on a beta blocker. Normally you see numbers in the 50-60’s with exercise heart rates prescribed in the higher 90’s to lower 100’s. This is a concern that needs to be addressed to her doctor, before a workout session can begin (medical clearance). Lastly, Ellen’s aerobic fitness fell on the lower side of the fair category. This is a very good thing to see, we are not starting entire from the bottom of the totem pole.  2.	Six-Month direction and specific goals: I am going to use the S.M.A.R.T model in order to help Ellen establish her goals. She has indicated that she can work with a trainer twice a week and do cardio on the weekends. I want to aim for a 3-day a week program of Ellen that includes cardiovascular and strength training exercises. Her S.M.A.R.T (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Reasonable, Timely) goal will be: Ellen will work out three days a week and complete at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular work along with 20 minutes of strength training and 10 minutes of stretching before her next profile assessment in 90 days. We will look to see an improvement in each category when comparing the two profiles. For her six-month direction, we will try get her to understand her body composition. I would like to her to set a more realistic goal of losing just 10 pounds. At 28% of 145, her lean body mass can be estimated at 105 pounds. With the recommend amount of body fat being 30 pounds, we can safely set her target weight at 135. This would only mean a 10 pound weight loss , so our six-month goal would have us working to lose just half of that (5lbs). We also will work diligently on strengthening and increasing her back flexibility in order to decrease back pain. Lastly, we will try to add in another day of exercise, totaling to 4 days a week.  3.	Workout Warm-up: 5 minutes on cardiovascular piece of choice Strength Training: Chest (push): DB Press on Incline Bench 2 set of 12 Back(pull): Lat Pull Down, Close Grip 2 set of 12 Shoulders (push): Arnold Press 2 set of 12 Back Extensions: 2 sets of 10 Legs: 1 Leg Balance: Long as is possible on each leg Tubing Side Steps: 2 sets of 12 each way Leg Curls (pull): 2 sets of 12 Leg Extensions on floor (push): 2 sets of 12 Biceps(pull): 21’s 2 set Triceps(push): Bench Dips 1 set of 12, 1 set  to failure Abdominal Crunches: 2 sets of 20 Sit on Ball and Balance Cardio: 20 minutes of interval training (:30-1:00) of cardiovascular piece of choice. Cool-Down: 5 minutes Stretching: Full-Body  4.	Working Out Alone: Make sure to warm-up for 5 minutes before each session. Complete a weight training circuit on the machines. One day upper body, One day lower, one day of both (depending on training sessions). After the strength session, complete a 30 minute session of cardio using the interval training method used in the Personal Training sessions (unless otherwise instructed during the sessions).  5.	Programs to Try: Water Aerobics (counts as entire workout session, Yoga for flexibility and stress management, Pilates for core strength, spinning (counts as entire workout session), Around the Club in 60 days, Personal Training, Nutrition counseling.   6.	Nutrition Guidelines: Due to my ACE certification, I am only qualified to disperse information relating to the food guide pyramid. I would have her write down a 3-day food diary (including 2 weekdays and one weekend day) and then sit down with her to discuss it. Then I would show her how to sneak in fruits and veggies in order for her to get in the number of servings recommended by the pyramid.  When we talk about weight loss, we will aim for 1/2 pound per week, or 1750 calories. She can achieve this weight loss by creating a deficit of only 250 calories per day. This can be obtained through exercise or a combination of diet and exercise (the latter the recommended). I have a feeling it will be easy for her to exercise and then feel like she can have a snickers bar. One of my goals will be to get her to see a Nutritionist so she can get more in-depth explanation of why her diet needs to include the food guide pyramid and not the “see food” diet.  7.	CV recommendations: THR: 220-AGE=MHR MHR=220-31 MHR=189 	 	65% of MHR= 189*.65 	65%= 122  	85% of MHR= 189*.85 	85%= 160  	THR Zone= 122-160  NOTE: This is only calculated based upon a estimated max. Ellen is on a beta blocker and therefore we will have to disregard this information and use the recommended range from her doctor.

      I saw this on a BGSU alumnist Blog and I thought it was pretty interesting.  So, as to give credit, thanks Josh Minton! You can visit his blog by clicking  urlLink here :  by: David R. Kamerschen, Ph.D.  Distinguished Professor of Economics  University of Georgia    "Here's what every democrat (or any other government bureaucrat) ought to learn before they propose their give-away programs...    Tax Cuts - A Simple Lesson In Economics. This is how the cookie crumbles.  Please read it carefully.  Let's put tax cuts in terms everyone can understand. Suppose that every  day, ten men go out for dinner. The bill for all ten comes to $100. If  they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like  this:  The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.  The fifth would pay $1.  The sixth would pay $3.  The seventh $7.  The eighth $12.  The ninth $18.  The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.  So, that's what they decided to do.  The ten men ate dinner in the restaurant every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve. "Since you are all such good customers," he said, "I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by $20." So, now dinner for the ten only cost! $80. The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes.  So, the first four men were unaffected. They would still eat for free. But  what about the other six, the paying customers? How could they divvy up  the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his 'fair share'?  The six men realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being 'PAID' to eat their meal.  So, the restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay.  And so:  The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).  The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% savings).  The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28% savings).  The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings).  The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).  The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).  Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to eat for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.  "I only got a dollar out of the $20," declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man "but he got $10!"  "Yeah, that's right," exclaimed the fifth man. "I only saved a dollar, too. It's unfair that he got ten times more than me!"  "That's true!!" shouted the seventh man. "Why should he get $10 back when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks!"  "Wait a minute," yelled the first four men in unison. "We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!"  The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.  The next night the tenth man didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!  And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up at the table anymore."

      You know...I really don't like Monday's.  &nbsp;  Today just felt really weird. I can't explain it, it just did.  &nbsp;  On a good note, everyone seemed to notice and really like my haircut (courtesy of Rachel).  &nbsp;  I really wish that I always had a three day weekend. I remember when I lived with my friend Rayanna my sophomore year at BG she didn't have any classes on Friday's, both semesters. A fucking three day weekend for an entire year.  &nbsp;  I hate you Kenny.  &nbsp;  OH! Jon and I went to go see Spiderman on Saturday.  &nbsp;  Dude...that movie is SO cool. I was seriously like "OH SHIT!" or "FUCK!" during the action scenes. They are so intense and so freaking cool! I also managed to wipe some tears during the flick as well. While I really wouldn't mind seeing that movie again...I really want to see  I Robot  as well. Will Smith is funny, funny man, and I, love to laugh.  &nbsp;  ha ha ha.  &nbsp;  Yeah...  &nbsp;  I am feeling really random and I am finding that I really don't have anything to say...well not anything meaningful.  &nbsp;  I'll give a go tomorrow.  &nbsp;  Until then,  &nbsp;  Word to your brother.&nbsp;

She is in the need of cheering up due to going through a break-up, so we did what every woman should do when this happens...Shop.     &nbsp;   I didn't spend that much money, but it's money that I shouldn't have spent. BUT there are things that I do need right now, so I thought what the hell. I bought three cute t-shirts and a book for myself as well as one for Jon. Then Today I bought&nbsp;a new pair of athletic shoes. I REALLY needed them...but dammit, I just shouldn't of done it.     &nbsp;   I need money.     &nbsp;   Anyone willing to donate?

      Last night I went out with Cricket to our favorite place, BW's, and we probably won't be able to do that again for a long while.  She is moving (to Texas). And I am sad.  I did pretty well last night though. Sang some karoke, did a shot of tequila. No tears till after I said goodbye and she could no longer see me.   She's a good friend. And I'm going to miss her a whole bunch.  I only hope that she see's me as the kind of friend that I see her as. Cricket is one of those friends that every girl should have. The one that can always cheer you up, the one that always understands, the one that knows exactly what you are thinking and when.&nbsp; Almost like a soulmate friendship. I wish I could of had a moment to tell her how much&nbsp; our friendship means. Hopefully, she knows. Or, she'll read this...lol  I made a little picture slideshow of our night out&nbsp;on my other blog that you can view by clicking  urlLink here .  It was a good night and good way to say "I'll see ya soon," to a very good friend.  Love ya, Crickey.

      We are moving down the Balcony.   It actually hasn't been too bad. I really hate moving, well, who doesn't really. But, I can actually say that I enjoyed the moving that Jon and I did last night. I get really excited about stupid little things. Not like this is a little thing though. Moving in with a dude for the first time is not a little thing. I am smiling right now having our own place is just pretty damn neat.   We are not the only ones moving this week.   My very good friend Cricket is moving to Texas tomorrow.   That makes me very sad.   However, she is moving with her boyfriend down there. He is going to grad school and she got a pretty neat teaching job. I am very excited for both of them, but I know BG won't be the same without her. Hopefully, Jon and I will be able to go and visit sometime. I've never been to Texas, so that would be a good time.   Next on the list is my other good friend Rachel. I have a feeling that she might be moving back to BG in the near future. That would kick ass...because then I would actually have a friend in BG. Damn, I'm pathetic. But good friends are hard to find and most women are just bitches (just come and meet our former downstairs neighbor).   The one thing I don't want to think about is the stuff that I still have in my apartment in Stow. It's just going to be a pain to drive up there, get all my shit loaded then clean the place...ugh. Anyone want to do it for me?   Ah...the adventures of a youngin'...   &nbsp;

      I wish I was 16 again.  The pace of my job has picked up and I am finding myself dead as a dog when I return home each evening. Yesterday, I taught 2 fitness classes, managed to lift for 90 minutes, train 2 clients (let me tell you, your trainer is working hard when they are working with you) and then worked on the floor. After that 13 hour day, I was dead as all hell. I can't believe it. When I was 16 my days went like this:      Get up around 8 and go to cheerleading practice for anywhere from 2 to 4 hours. Then ride my bike to the pool (a 7 mile ride), swim some then ride back (roundtrip=14 miles). Then I would go rollerblading for atleast an hour. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I had Gymnastics for about an hour and a half. Then I ended the day with a 3 mile run. I did that everday during the summer. I felt fine each day...granted I was a little exercise crazy then...but, dammit, where did all my energy go? However, it's a good feeling to know I work hard each day.  Today, after not getting as much sleep as I would of liked after yesterday, it was back to the grindstone nice and early. After work I swam for about 45 minutes. I like the water a whole lot. However, I taught spinning about an hour after that. So here I am again tonight, tired as a dog. I also, to my delight, picked up another client today. He bought 12 sessions (the most I've sold) and that totally rocked my day. Another highlight, I put one of my bosses through a leg workout. Dude, I kicked his ass. You know you have kicked a dude's ass when their t-shirt is soaking wet with sweat when they are done and yelling OH MY GOD as they complete a lap of walking lunges around a track. Sweet.  I am SO glad to be home and finally be able to relax and enjoy this AWESOME weather we are having in good Ol' Bowling Green, Ohio.

      Things are going pretty well at work. I now have two clients and I'm stoked! Although, we can't train during our floor hours, so this means...loooonnng days. Today I will be at the Club from 9:30a to 10:00p today. I am feeling pretty tired today, let's hope I'll make it through alright.  Another cool thing is that while our Group Exercise Coordinator is away to get hitched, they asked me to fill in for her. I thought that was pretty sweet. Only been there a month and it seems like finally I am getting the recognition I deserve for knowing my shit.  On another note, I watched President Clinton last night on Letterman. I love President Clinton...I wish he could run again. I believe that he was an excellent President. You can't tell me he didn't do great things for our country. I think a lot of people let the whole Monica scandal overshadow what he did in office. I hate that. I mean, come on! It's not like EVERY other President didn't fool around. It's what politicians do! *sigh* I just sat there on the couch next to Jon and listened intently to every word he had to say. I don't think President Bush could hold my attention (let alone many Americans) with the same interest and entertainment as President Clinton did last night. It's a damn shame he can't run again.  You know what has to suck for a former President? Watching the guy in office fuck everything up so bad and knowing that once you had the power to make the decisions he's not making.  That's all I have to say about that.  Ah, so now here begins my day and I already feel like I need to go to bed.

      I just read a blog that kind of set off some things that have been swirling around in my head lately. It read "I've never heard of killing Christians."  What, are Christians some superior form of our race?  More and more lately, organized religion is just pissing me off. It just seems like some people go to church to say "I'm special, you're special, we're all just a bunch of special fuckers." (-Stiffler, American Wedding.) Who says ANY type of belief makes you a better person, more creditable, or I don't know, anything excuse that people come up with you today that tells you "God is the way." And what's all the shit about who's God is "better?" WHO CARES! If you came to this country for religious freedom then pray to your God, Allah or whoever the hell you like and keep your damn mouth shut. It's just respect for one and other. I don't care who anyone prays to. If it makes you happy, dammit, do it. Just don't try and tell me what to do.  And another thing.  I went to see John Kerry and John Edwards speak in BG yesterday. I just love it when "those christians" (referring not to all believers, just the ones that try and push their believes upon you and belittle you by...) decide to tote along their posters of aborted babies. You know, get a life. This just pisses me of. I don't care if you want to preach that in "your house," just leave it at home. I don't want to see it. I've already made up my mind that I have a right to chose. I don't think I'm the only person that feels that way, especially living in a college town. Get over it. Not everyone is this world believes the same things.  Not everyone believes in God. It's just the way it goes.  You know, Karl Marx was on to something when he wrote about religion being developed for societal control. I really think some of this might be true. When I really stop to think (really think with an educated mind here people) how can evolution not be possible? How can all of what the Bible says be true? I do think there might be a higher power, but is there really hard evidence? I have a friend that use to be super religious who once told me that after reading the Bible so many times and really thinking about what it said, he decided that it was a bunch of shit. He told me there are so many contradicting passages in the Bible ( I would enlighten you but I don't remember everything and I wouldn't want to just throw something out there that I thought was right and get bashed even more for this post). So are people basing their lives on a big, fat myth? (Not like it's uncommon, people, really. Greek mythology, The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter...yeah don't tell me there are some crazy people that really think they are hobbits or wizards). So why doesn't make since that after reading such a book, that people would call themselves christians...or followers of this Christ?  I just think too many people in this society have become a little crazy. Not a damn person in this world is better that anyone else. When it's the end of the day and we are laying in bed, we all worry about the same things, talk about the same things... every person even shits. So a phrase to you if you think after this post that you are better than me...  Screw you and your little dog too.

      I want to know when these sort of things come out and why I'm not notified! I am positive I am a better fan (Go Falcons!) than any of these girls on here!  Since I don't get a chance...I decided to vote for  urlLink Scott Bottoms , or #6. If you like what you read, you can go and vote for Scott,  urlLink here .  I'm still pouting that I can't be a contestant.

      Here's to another week. Another day, another dollar...another bill.  Today was a pretty good day. The time went fast and I had fun at work. I also had a damn good workout today as well. It went something like:  Jenny Craig'ed it out to the Stadium and ran stairs...then lunged across the entire football field. Then I headed to the Club to complete 20 minutes of core work, focusing on the obliques. Then I complete a upper body circuit and ended with BOSU lunges superset with a minute on the StepMill. My hammies are feeling a little worked this evening...but that's a good thing.  Off the fitness note, I think every road in BG is under construction. It's kind of annoying. I am really hoping that Wooster Street will be put back together before the students come (and the damn tractor pull), but it doesn't look likely. Note to self: Drive the back way to get on 75.  Another great thing...Football season is almost here. I LOVE football. There is nothing like an intense football game, sitting in the crowd, yelling at the refs...as I write this I am watching Monday Night Football with my baby. They were showing clips of John Elway and Barry Sanders and half-time. All I have to say is, GOD DAMN those dudes were fucking amazing. Athletes are amazing. I try to think I'm an athlete at times...but I'll never be Joe Montana...although my gym teacher in grade school called me Joe Montana one day when we were learning how to throw a football. I don't mean to brag, but I can throw a football pretty well. I can also catch pretty well and run....needless to say, I'd be useful on a REC co-ed team. I can remember playing backyard football in high school. I played with some of our football players and damn it was fun. I almost got my ankle broken once and lots of bruises, but it was worth it. Very good memories...  I think if I start reminiscing like this the entry will end up being pages long...so off I go!

      Today was my one day weekend. The second one of these in a row...very sad. Next weekend will entail going to Stow to pick up the rest of my things and my apartment and turning in the keys. Then the next weekend I think we may be going to Troy to see Jon's family. It seems as if I'll never have another lazy weekend again.  Today was productive, however. Jon and I made a lot of progress on putting things away. The living room and kitchen are complete...now there is just they guest bedroom to get squared away. It'll be so nice when everything is finally done.  This week is going to be another busy one. I am going to have about 8 training sessions (awesome) and then my regular floor hours. That's a full-time week! Last week and this week should be very good for the next paycheck. I'm looking forward to it.  Well, it's back to relaxing while I still can...
