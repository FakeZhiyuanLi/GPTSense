      Seen on a billboard along the 405:   "DETOX UNDER ANESTHESIA!"  "CALL 1-888-OPIATES"   Now, that has got to be a good trick.   What, so they put you in a coma for 2 months??  Amazing.  But the question remains: Truly, Are You Clean on the Inside??

      Here in SoCal, we've had an amazingly hot weekend.  Just ask any local TV newscaster.  I mean, we are talking  "RECORD BREAKING TEMPERATURES THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHLAND!!!!!!!"   People  MUST STAY HYDRATED.   Long lines out the door at Jamba Juice.  Oh my total god.  It was 89 degrees.  Yeah, that's right.   EIGHTY-NINE DEGREES .  You'd have thought we were in France in during last summer's killer heatwave where no one has air conditioning and they go on vacation for a month and leave their elderly to die.  Sunday was lovely.  The Huz and I went down to Malibu to go kayaking in the morning.  We paddled gently over a glassy sea and around pier pilings encrusted with some of the biggest sea stars I've ever seen.  Bright orange and purple creatures piled on top of each other in the primeval soup vying for sustenance.  Fulminating kelp beds and lots of hopeful surfers on the point.  Back on shore, we had lunch at a new cafe on the newly restored Malibu Pier.  It's called Mo's, and it was almost perfect, except that they need like 3 more umbrellas for days as warm as that one was.   But, you're right over the water, great view, spicy Bloody Marys and decent grub.  Sandwiches, taco, salads and the like.  The whole morning was practically perfect.  Gotta love that Southern California livin'.  Yesterday, I was back at the beach again - this time further south in the freak show that is Venice Beach.  One of daughter S.'s good friends had a birthday, and since there was no school due to an inservice day, S and gal pals D and E kidnapped the birthday girl J-dawg and I transported them to Venice's Ocean Front Walk.  The beach was blazin' again.  Right away the girls were accosted by a man who wanted them to model in front of his henna tattoo booth for some ad pictures he was taking.  An immediate taste of local flavor/weirdness.  All part of the fun.   I had luckily made arrangements to have lunch with an old pal who lives in Santa Monica so I left the girls to their own devices on the Ocean Front Walk and went to a nice cool restaurant to catch up and dish the dirt (and the fried calamari) with Adrienne.  It was wonderful to see her as always and wax nostalgic about old times.  And laugh a lot.  She never fails to entertain with her stories and sense of humor.  I have to make a point to see her more often.    We went back after lunch and shopping and met the girls, who I think had a really fun time too, thought they did look hot and tired.  They shopped and did lunch too.  Daughter S. bought a few more shirts to add to her wardrobe.  They were cute, and NOT black, thank heaven.  Seeing as how she already has like 37 black tops!  She also bought a pepper spray thingy from a guy who said,"in California all's you need are 4 words... Pepper Spray, Ass Hole!"   Hil-arious.  So it was a successful outing and... Happy Birthday J-Dawg!   15 big ones.  T-  OUT

      Well, the Lakers will make the playoffs anyhow.  They won handily last night against the Timberwolves.  Here's some photos of the fun down at Staples last night.  Some are a bit out of focus, oh well.  Still good.          The Mailman    Jumbotron    The Huz viewing plenty with binocs.    This is actually from last week's game.  The defenders of Kobe.    And of course, something to get the fans excited!

      Yesterday I had lunch with some good friends at Boccacio's down by the lake.  In attendance were Mama Kat, Michele, new mama Mariellen and baby Abigail, and dear pal Elly who is the radiant mama-to-be.  Mariellen's baby is adorable and so tiny at one month old.  It was a lovely afternoon and a real treat to see everyone.  We're having Elly's baby shower here in May and I can't wait.  It's gonna be sweet.  Today I'm off to see another friend and spend the night down in the O.C.  This is one of my bestest buds for years and years...since 1st grade as a matter of fact!  It's so cool that we can always pick up where we left off, even though we only get together intermittently.  A sign of true friendship.  Below are some photos from yesterday's lunch as well as a couple of my own (14 yr old) baby S and her gal-pal, D.  They were slam dancing in the office.  Oh Yeah.    Hot Mamas and baby    Dear little Abigail     Mama Kat    Miss Michele    Go Girls     Punk Rock Lives in my House.    T -  OUT

           Sandra Tsing Loh is a writer, performer and radio program host. Her show "Loh Life" was on KCRW-FM, and her written work has appeared in many publications including Buzz, The New York Times, Vogue, Elle and Harper's Bazaar.  She has also written some very funny books such as, "Aliens In America" and "If You Lived Here, You'd Be Home By Now", and "A Year in Van Nuys".  She was summarily fired this week from KCRW, a National Public Radio Station, of all places, because the F-word was inadvertently broadcast during one of her taped commentaries. Apparently an engineer forgot to bleep out the INDECENT LANGUAGE.  Later, management took back their decision, but Loh has turned down General Manager Ruth Seymour's invitation to resume "The Loh Life" on KCRW.  I love how the FCC has put the fear of GOD  and big ass fines into these radio stations and they are just tripping all over themselves in order to become as milquetoast as possible.  See, it starts with the dirty words and then just wait.  What's next - no nasty talk about our fearless leaders?   And, of course, we're doing this for "the kids".  'Cause, like, so many of them listen to NPR.  It's a very slippery slope, my friends.  T -  OUT

      Last night another reminder that we in Suburbia are not immune to anger & racism.  Last night every teen in town went to see the latest horror-fest, "Dawn of the Dead" at our local theater.  I went to pick up S. and some of her friends after the movie was over, only see a large crowd of kids gathered in the parking lot and it looked like a fight or something was about to break out.  As I argued with S. about whether she could hang out longer, since EVERYBODY was there, I saw several of the more angry & vocal teenage white boys yelling and threatening some Hispanic kids who looked to be about 9 to 11 years old, if that.  Apparently these younger kids were annoying everyone during the movie, walking in and out, talking, whatever.  So, instead of just ratting them out to the theater personnel, people in the audience just kept yelling at them during the movie.  Then after it was over, they moved outside and began harassing them in the parking lot.  I showed up at the tail end of it in time to hear one of the older teen boys yelling at these little girls something to the effect of, "go back to Mexico, you fucking puta" and some other equally nasty stuff.  I'm sitting in my car, and I can't believe my ears.  So I yelled at him," hey what the hell's the matter with you!?  You and your racist friends need to leave!  Asshole!"  Then he called me a bitch and got in his car and split.    As this was happening, S. and her friends came up to get in the car.  S. was horrified and embarrassed by my behavior because, well, you want your mom to be invisible, and also because this guy's locker is right next to hers....aargh.  Then I had to explain my position loudly and forcefully on the drive home with her friends in the back.  Which I'm sure didn't help her state of mortification.  But I would like all these kids to understand that this type of thing is NOT acceptable.    I may have overreacted a tad, but for a long time both the Huz and myself have found it very disturbing that so many people in this town, even the ones who I consider more liberal, seem to have a subtle sort of racist streak regarding Hispanics.  For instance, 99% of people around here always refer to them as "Mexicans".  Of course, many of them are indeed from Mexico, but a lot are also from Central America, i.e. El Salvador, Nicaragua, etc.  And perhaps South America too.  It's a small thing and most people would just say, well, it's sort of a convenient catch-all term.  But that is racism for sure because it lumps all these various cultures into one group, denying their diversity.  And when people refer to "the Mexicans" it's almost always said with disdain.  It's very disturbing.  Especially so because so many of the teenagers are practicing the behavior they learned from their parents.  I hope the message that we are sending to S. gets through.  I'm pretty confident that it is.    Just one more thing to keep on top of.  T-  OUT

      My friend Ron sent me some very funny anti-Bush stuff.  You must check out this link--  urlLink dishonest dubya   You will laugh.  However, all of us like-minded types must unite in a very serious way to get Bush out of office.  I feel the need this time to actually get off my lazy ass and do something meaningful within the Kerry campaign to assist the cause.  And I've heard from other friends that they feel the same urgency. So everybody, where do we start?  Shall we call Kerry HQ in Ventura, Santa Barbara or L.A. Counties?  T -  OUT

      I had too much to dream last night..... A horrible nightmare about an enormous orange & black spider on my face.  I actually woke up screaming.  Quite odd.  Then I got up and looked for it with my book light.  Because I really think there was a spider, probably a daddy longlegs, wandering around with abandon on my person.  Yuck.  But I didn't find anything and it took awhile to get back to sleep.  The Huz has gone to San Fransico on business today - he'll be back tomorrow.  Miss him already.  I wish I could've gone with so we could have dinner together at Nanking tonight.  Which is a Chinese restaurant / hole in the wall/ neighborhood insitution that is fantastic.  Love the line-up on the sidewalk and the impatient Chinese waiters.  "You ready?"  Ummm...."Here - have the Four Happiness - very good tonight! Ok?  And 2 more beers."  And then in like 30 seconds your food appears.  It's amazing.  And damn tasty.  T -  OUT

      Okay, Blogger is frustrating me!  Yesterday when I posted pictures they were visible, now they aren't!!!  And I was feeling so smug.  Daughter says I should switch to a service called LiveJournal, which is much cooler and easier to use.  But I didn't want to do the exact same thing that she and all of her friends do....I just like the idea of being on a different service but if I can't get if figured out, I may change.  Waaah.  So - Lakers win by a nose last night.  We were almost ready to leave toward the end of the 3rd quarter, but Kobe came in and took over.  It went into overtime - with Kobe being the only one making baskets.  Lakers defense looked lousy, the guys on the Magic making tons of outside shots.  It was an exciting ending.  And as always, I enjoyed the atmosphere of the Staples Center.  Where else do you get to pay $20.00 for 2 Heinekens and get all sloppy with equally high-priced pastrami sandwiches amongst the crazy melting pot that is an L.A. Laker game?  Whilst scoping out Jack Nicholson and his ilk.  Congratulations to our friend Geoff G!  I had coffee with Karen (his wife and also a good friend) yesterday and she informed me that Geoff was to be interviewed by Time Magazine that day.  Apparently he has been selected as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the U.S. due to his influence in the entertainment industry vis-a-vis The Sundance Film Festival.  He's the big cheese there.  And also a very generous, intelligent, complex guy.  It is thanks to him & Karen that I've been able to enjoy the festival madness in Park City, Utah, for the last 3 years.  I love the festival, the films are always thought-provoking, the parties are always a wonder, and the celebs are ubiquitous.  Anyway, I raise my coffee cup to you, Geoff.  You're the big brain behind Redford.  Kudos to you and your organization for  raising awareness around the many different artistic voices from all over the country and the world.  Getting people's stories out there.  A great showcase for so many diverse visions.  Something this country may be lacking soon if the Clear Channels and the religious right, the Bush administration, etc. continue on their relentless drive to censor media.  Speaking of film, "The Passion of The Christ" was #1 again last weekend.  Alright, this movie has become like Star Wars for Christians....churches exhorting their members to see it again and again....who cares if it's so violent that it should be NC-17?  People who won't let the kids go see an R-rated bloodfest like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" have no problem dragging the youngsters to this prolonged ultra-realistic explicit torture show.  I am planning to do a much longer rant on this whole thing, and Mel Gibson, but it will have to wait.  Meanwhile, I don't want to censor Mel Gibson, I just won't give him any of my money.  Just like I can turn off the radio or TV if I don't like what I hear or see...  Yes I do have to start my day.  I have to work the next three days so I better get some stuff done.  That's right, I have a job!  Let's see if this Laker shot from last night works....     Oh yeah- I'm stylin' now!  Shaq poppin' in a shot and you can even see Jack in the background.  ::pats self on back::   Bye now-  T -  OUT

      Yesterday the Huz and I went on a hike in the bucolic Santa Monica Mountains.  It was green and gorgeous with billows of fog spilling softly over the ridges from the ocean.  We trekked to the waterfall there, which was quite crowded with folks who had the same idea.  It's a popular spot actually.  Lots of dogs, too!  It's one of the few places in that area where you can bring man's or woman's best friend.  I would've liked to bring our Cookie, but she has a cut ear that needs to heal.  Not to mention she's tough to deal with in the car....and we wanted to relax.  Next time, maybe.  Anyhow, I figured out how to post some pictures I took.  I'm also excited about how I put my links in on the side of this...I know it's easy, but it's all new to me.  Anyways these are links to things I'm interested in.  We would've like to bring daughter S. also, but she had to stay home and do a biology project with her gal-pal, D.  I was really impressed by what they did...it was a mock CD representing one of the "kingdoms", such as animal.  I thought it was supremely clever, with the song titles and  the cover art.  So, check out the pleasant photos...I've got to get more adept at this camera!  Laker Game Tonight!  Yeah baby.  Free Chalupas for everyone again???  Let's hope.

      Greetings World at Large.  I have decided to join the teeming masses online and fiddle around with a blog.  Why the hell not?  I'm sure everyone could use my practical 2 cents.  Yeah, right.  So, for starters, I'm pretty much your basic domestic goddess type.  Living in my tract manse, in a quite pretty Californicated neighborhood.  But, you know, there's all that Lynchian darkness lurking under the soil.    I wouldn't be at all surprised to one day come across an ear sticking out of the dirt.    I live with my soulmate of nigh on 25 years (jesus!-insert time-passing cliche here!) and our 14 year old beautiful daughter.  We got the happy nuclear family type thing going on...with the usual teen tensions and stresses of modern consumer-style living.  I think we're ok though.  Especially when there are so many that aren't really ok...I think we're doing good.  In my never-to-be-humble opinion.  So, today is Saturday - the fog lifted an hour ago and daylight's burnin'.  2 newspapers have been read.  I cried reading about the horrible deaths in Spain due to the train explosions.  And the sad headline about a hometown boy, who was killed in Iraq.  Death on our doorway.  Or our neighbor's.  Chalk another one up to Dubya and his war against the phantom WMD's and that "madman".  Islamic extremists or the terrorists raising the ante all the time.  The world in its usual state of crisis. The Huz is off to work.  Yep on Saturday.  Part and parcel of having your own business.  On tap for this pleasant spring day:   Awaken said teen daughter.  Clean up the house.  Like painting the Golden Gate Bridge.  Then....well I got about 20 lbs of oranges from a friend's citrus ranch - time to haul out the ol' squeezer.  Maybe I'll paint the baseboards in my room.  Should clean out the cupboards and of course we need to finish the Wire Hanger Removal Project.  This is where we replace all our wire hangers with wood or plastic.  Ok, let's just call me Joan Crawford.  NO WIRE HANGERS!!!!  Have you ever read anything so banal in your life?  Well, I must go start my exciting day.  This can only get better.  Well, that remains to be seen.  Stay tuned for more heart-pounding posts from this space.   T out...

      Well, last Thursday The Huz, Daughter S and yours truly ventured out to The Greek Theater to see David Bowie in concert.  I was really looking forward to it and very excited.  I wasn’t disappointed.  Bowie proved once again exactly why he has one of the most long-lasting careers in the music business.   With youthful looks, a commanding presence and one helluva powerhouse of a band, this is one artist who definitely still has time on his side.  He looked tres hip in his long, sort of tattered waistcoat and low-rise jeans as he opened the show with a pounding version of “Rebel, Rebel” and brought the crowd immediately to its feet.  As it happened, I was already on my feet standing in line for a drink…aaargh!  But I still saw the first number from the bar area.  For some of us older Bowie fans (and there were plenty in the crowd), it was thrilling to hear many of our old favorites mixed in with the newer stuff.  But in addition to the choice of songs, Bowie was the consummate live entertainer that held his audience in his sway. From to his unbelievably strong vocal range to his upbeat and jovial interplay with his band and the audience, it was crystal clear that this man was born for the stage.   After the opening song, he went on to do two new songs that reflected his foray into techno style.  The Huz and I were quite impressed.  Later in the show, we were treated to great renditions of “Fashion”, “Heroes”, “Fame”, and “Under Pressure”, which he sang with his bass player who we thought was a guy, but is really a very tall, bald black woman!  Bowie’s band was excellent, his guitarist offering up some savage leads on a delicious take of "The Man Who sold The World" (an early Bowie song which was introduced to a younger audience when Nirvana performed a version of it).  I was enraptured to hear the glam-rock anthem "All The Young Dudes," - re-living my youth in spades -   and the wistful “Quicksand”.  But it was the 'wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am' quadruple whammy encore from his 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars that worked me and the rest of the audience into a fever pitch. Bowie pumped it up with my FAVORITE SONG EVER, “Hang onto Yourself” before the dam broke with high octane version of "Suffragette City", the anthem-like "5 Years", and ending on the even higher note of "Ziggy Stardust" which climaxed with Bowie exercising his emotive passion-soaked vocals.     Gee, do you think I liked it??  Oh yeah, and the Polyphonic Spree played too.  I thought they were a church group, what with the flowing robes and all.  Weird.  Sort of like, "Age of Aquarius"-y.   Check out the pics below.  Daughter S did a great job of surreptitious photography.  Lots of security types around.  Yes, we're teaching her bad things.  Some are a bit out of focus, but that’s the best we could do undercover.    I loved his outfit!       Yes, the dude in red is a laaady!             I like this one - it's freaky cool.    They had big screens and some neat video stuff.  What an awesome family outing!   T - OUT

        I stole this from the Humor Gazette, written by John Breneman.  However, this is no satire.       Make no mistake. Gathering threat. Must not waver. Stay the course.  His Tuesday night press conference was going along just fine. The president had successfully ducked one question about whether he'd made any "errors in judgment" and dodged another about "personal responsibility for September 11th."  He in-your-faced the nation by playing the dunce, twice, when asked clearly and directly why he and the vice president insist on appearing before the 9/11 Commission together instead of individually.  George W. Bush had wisely chosen to field questions from the East Room of the White House instead of from the deck of an aircraft carrier in front of a giant "Mission Accomplished" banner. And when Uncle Dick picked out the evening's attire, the famous military flightsuit was tucked deep in the White House play closet.  President Bush did not waver from his message while he stayed the course. There was no talk of outsourcing the fighting to India if the violence does not abate.  He even answered a question on the minds of many. "Mr. President, who will we be handing the Iraqi government over to on June 30th?"   BUSH (actual words) : "We'll find that out soon. That's what Mr. Brahimi is doing. He's figuring out the nature of the entity we'll be handing sovereignty over."  See, Brahimi is on it. He's gonna let us know. No truth to the rumor Cheney plans to sell the strife-torn nation to Halliburton for an undisclosed sum and some quid pro quo to be named later.  Once the entity is identified and order restored it will be safe to implement the president's time-tested economic development strategy -- distribute generous tax breaks to the rich and open the region to exploitation by corporate friends with addresses in the Bahamas.  Some of the questions were kind of tough but stuff kept coming out of his mouth. "Now is the time and Iraq is the place." And the smirk stayed tucked away, at least until it leaked out when he said the oil revenue stream there is "pretty darn significant."  But trouble loomed ahead, a grave and gathering question. Mr. President: "After 9-11, what would your biggest mistake be … and what lessons have learned from it?"   BUSH (actual words) : "I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I could plan for it. John, I'm sure historians will look back and say, gosh, he could've done it better this way or that way. You know, I just -- I'm sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to come up with answer, but it hadn't yet. …"   "I hope -- I don't want to sound like I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't -- you just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with one."   Tracey interjects comment here:     Oh god.  He's so awful. He just flounders around until he can dredge up a marginally appropriate sound bite--and when the question doesn't allow for that, he's just utterly lost.  God forbid the President of the United States of America should be able to think on his feet.    And don't get him started on those weapons of mass destruction. "They could still be there. They could be hidden, like the 50 tons of mustard gas in a turkey farm," Turkey?  Oh yeah.  Stay the course. Hypothetical linguistic analysis reveals that President Bush favors the word "course" because it subconsciously reminds him of country club living and shooting golf with his dad and that he favors the term "stay the course" because it's stuck in his head from hearing Dana Carvey poke fun at his pop.  "Stay the course" means never having to say you're sorry, never having to answer any question you don't want to.  Stay the course, and you'll probably find those weapons after all. You may even get that parade for the American liberators you promised yourself way back when.    Make no mistake. Gathering threat. Dangerous man. Stay the course?          T - OUT

      Yeah, it's been spring break this last week in my lil' 'burb.  Which basically means that Daughter S has been free!!  Free to hang out with friends, sleep til noon, hang out with friends, sleep til noon, walk around the neighborhood with friends...you get the picture.  We didn't do anything special this week.  But then, something momentous happened.  A Boy.  That's right - a boyfriend-type-boy.  Be still my beating heart.  This Boy has an Irish name like Daughter S, but he is not Irish.  He's an Asian punk-rock kid.  He likes a lot of the same music I do.  From what I know of him, he seems like an agreeable young man.  He's someone who was a friend of S's and now it's snowballed and turned into something more.  Much more.  Well, I am speculating somewhat, but let me just say that they are sitting on our couch watching a movie RIGHT THIS VERY MINUTE.  And have spent quite a bit of time together this week.  How cozy. Oh Dear. And now the vigilance must be redoubled. Well, no one said it was easy.  T-  OUT

      Last Saturday night, I had the opportunity to once again see one of my all -time favorite bands, the one and only  X .  This band was one of the best musical things to come out of Los Angeles in the late 70's and through the 80's.  John Doe, Exene Cervenka, DJ Bonebrake and the incomparable Mr. Billy Zoom comprised the soundtrack of our life back in the day.  Original, thoughtful, badass rock n' roll.  They came out of the punk/poetry/rockabilly scene to deliver desperate meditations on society at high velocity and max volume, with Billy Zoom's blistering crackling guitar licks.   Anyway, the Huz and I got to show Daughter S what it's all about at The Canyon Club and it was great.  Great venue, great performance.  They did most of my favorite songs, hardly stopping to take a breath.  All of the band members were in top form, and I think John Doe was surprised at the all the X fans there, and the energy.  We were in a tight spot right up against the stage on John Doe's side, it was awesome.  And I got the bruises on my legs to prove it!  I took some pictures towards the end of the show which I will post below.  Naughty me, I know it's not allowed, but I saw others doing it so....I'm easily led, what can I say?  After the show I was talking to a roadie who had on the same X shirt as me and he led us backstage where we were able to get all their autographs on the stuff I bought and chat for a few minutes.  Exene seemed kinda hammered, I know they all must have been tired, but everyone was gracious and friendly.  Daughter S got Billy to sign an old postcard picture of himself and she said he was a little taken aback by the sight of his very much younger self in the picture.  Hey man, I feel ya.   Again, a totally fun show enjoyed by all.     Next up:  David Bowie, April 22!     John Doe    Billy Zoom    John and Exene    From the stage    Me & Daughter S - in the pit    The Younger X and autographs    Exene's book & Autograph scrawl    God I love these guys...

      Another thing I did last week was host a shower for my good friend, Elly here at the house.  My other pal, Michele helped me with it and it was really lovely.  Elly looked absolutely radiant and we're so happy for her and Brian.  They've come quite a ways since they fell in love at our mutual place of employment, Fins.  Of course, yours truly was key in getting them together.  Heheh.  Yep, they made the journey from carefree party people to pending parenthood.  I'm sure it's going to be wonderful. Here's photographic evidence of the good time had by all.   urlLink    Our scrumptious Shower Buffet.

      Sheesh, I haven't updated in awhile.  Life is busy and now I'm suffering from this nasty back problem that makes sitting in front of this machine difficult.  I'm feeling ok for the moment and I thought I'd try to catch up on this here blog.   So, last week was the annual high school ritual, or ritual torture for some perhaps, known as Prom.  These days it's taken on the proportions of a mini-wedding.  I remember mine--it almost was a complete disaster, but in the end it was much fun.  My dress was a blue/cream floral halter that cost about $35.  My date wore a matching powder blue tux. And he actually drove us there in his car, probably like his dad's Buick.  No Hummer limos. Yeah, we're talking  1976!  We went to lots of cool parties afterwards, ending up at Jana Potter's breakfast buffet at 6 AM with a champagne fountain!!!  Her dad was very rich and it was awesome.  Good times, good times.   This year I knew several of the Moorpark attendees, including the daughters of two of my very close friends.  So I whipped out the ol' digital camera and immortalized the moment.     urlLink     Miss Reid G  looked like a princess in her champagne gown.

      Okay, I just watched the trailer for the new Michael Moore documentary film,  "Fahrenheit 911"  on his website.  I simply CANNOT wait to see this movie.  It comes out next Friday, July 25 and I urge anyone and everyone to go see it.  Moore won the Palme d' Or (kinda like a French Oscar) at the Cannes Film Festival for this and it looks amazing.  And frightening.  Even if you don't agree with my politics or Moore's this is an important work that speaks to many things the Bush administration has done in regards to the Sept. 11th attack and the Iraq War that I don't feel many people are aware of.  Everyone should see this side of the issues before they vote in November.  Or if you're not of voting age, (all you teens out there, you know who you are) see it anyway so you know something about what our government is really up to.    Moore's last film,  "Bowling for Columbine"  was extremely well-done.   It raised so many questions about America's gun-loving, violent culture in a way that I had not even thought about before, it was fascinating.  I will say that Moore can be somewhat over the top in places, a bit too conspiracy-oriented, but I do tend to agree with the majority of his conclusions.  If you haven't seen it, you should rent it.  Anyhow, remember, next Friday check your movie listings and make a plan to see  "Fahrenheit 911"  this summer!!  If you want to check out the trailer, click on the Michael Moore link on the side of my blog.     Peace Out -    T

      I know, I know, I'm a bit late with this but I had to post something...especially since I live within binocular distance of where The Supply-Side Cowboy is now interred.  People are still marching to the Library by the thousands to get a look at his sunset-facing grave, and engage in still more slavering worship.  It's like, "let's all get real stupid, let's all wave the flag and have an emotional coming together!!!"    Not to mention that the "liberal media's" unprecedented 24/7 gushing over a controversial and divisive president caps a quarter-century of fawning.  Well, I'm sure he was such a nice man.  And we shouldn't speak ill of the dead.  But some of us do remember more than his photo ops.     Thanks to Ron for sending me that cartoon - it's a good one.   T- OUT

      I've been meaning to post this for awhile. I friend sent it to me and it reminded me why Kurt Vonnegut has always been one of my favorite writers.  It looks long, but it reads fast.    Cold Turkey  By Kurt Vonnegut        May 10, 2004      Many years ago, I was so innocent I still considered it possible that we could become the humane and reasonable America so many members of my generation used to dream of. We dreamed of such an America during the Great Depression, when there were no jobs. And then we fought and often died for that dream during the Second World War, when there was no peace.  But I know now that there is not a chance in hell of America's becoming humane and reasonable. Because power corrupts us, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Human beings are chimpanzees who get crazy drunk on power. By saying that our leaders are power-drunk chimpanzees, am I in danger of wrecking the morale of our soldiers fighting and dying in the Middle East? Their morale, like so many bodies, is already shot to pieces. They are being treated, as I never was, like toys a rich kid got for Christmas.  When you get to my age, if you get to my age, which is 81, and if you have reproduced, you will find yourself asking your own children, who are themselves middle-aged, what life is all about. I have seven kids, four of them adopted.  Many of you reading this are probably the same age as my grandchildren. They, like you, are being royally shafted and lied to by our Baby Boomer corporations and government.  I put my big question about life to my biological son Mark. Mark is a pediatrician, and author of a memoir, The Eden Express. It is about his crackup, straightjacket and padded cell stuff, from which he recovered sufficiently to graduate from Harvard Medical School.  Dr. Vonnegut said this to his doddering old dad: "Father, we are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is." So I pass that on to you. Write it down, and put it in your computer, so you can forget it.  I have to say that's a pretty good sound bite, almost as good as, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." A lot of people think Jesus said that, because it is so much the sort of thing Jesus liked to say. But it was actually said by Confucius, a Chinese philosopher, 500 years before there was that greatest and most humane of human beings, named Jesus Christ.  The Chinese also gave us, via Marco Polo, pasta and the formula for gunpowder. The Chinese were so dumb they only used gunpowder for fireworks. And everybody was so dumb back then that nobody in either hemisphere even knew that there was another one.  But back to people, like Confucius and Jesus and my son the doctor, Mark, who've said how we could behave more humanely, and maybe make the world a less painful place. One of my favorites is Eugene Debs, from Terre Haute in my native state of Indiana. Get a load of this:  Eugene Debs, who died back in 1926, when I was only 4, ran 5 times as the Socialist Party candidate for president, winning 900,000 votes, 6 percent of the popular vote, in 1912, if you can imagine such a ballot. He had this to say while campaigning:  As long as there is a lower class, I am in it. As long as there is a criminal element, I'm of it. As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free.   Doesn't anything socialistic make you want to throw up? Like great public schools or health insurance for all?  How about Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes?  Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth.  Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. ...  And so on.  Not exactly planks in a Republican platform. Not exactly Donald Rumsfeld or Dick Cheney stuff.  For some reason, the most vocal Christians among us never mention the Beatitudes. But, often with tears in their eyes, they demand that the Ten Commandments be posted in public buildings. And of course that's Moses, not Jesus. I haven't heard one of them demand that the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes, be posted anywhere.  "Blessed are the merciful" in a courtroom? "Blessed are the peacemakers" in the Pentagon? Give me a break!   There is a tragic flaw in our precious Constitution, and I don't know what can be done to fix it. This is it: Only nut cases want to be president.  But, when you stop to think about it, only a nut case would want to be a human being, if he or she had a choice. Such treacherous, untrustworthy, lying and greedy animals we are!  I was born a human being in 1922 A.D. What does "A.D." signify? That commemorates an inmate of this lunatic asylum we call Earth who was nailed to a wooden cross by a bunch of other inmates. With him still conscious, they hammered spikes through his wrists and insteps, and into the wood. Then they set the cross upright, so he dangled up there where even the shortest person in the crowd could see him writhing this way and that.  Can you imagine people doing such a thing to a person?  No problem. That's entertainment. Ask the devout Roman Catholic Mel Gibson, who, as an act of piety, has just made a fortune with a movie about how Jesus was tortured. Never mind what Jesus said.  During the reign of King Henry the Eighth, founder of the Church of England, he had a counterfeiter boiled alive in public. Show biz again.  Mel Gibson's next movie should be The Counterfeiter. Box office records will again be broken.  One of the few good things about modern times: If you die horribly on television, you will not have died in vain. You will have entertained us.  And what did the great British historian Edward Gibbon, 1737-1794 A.D., have to say about the human record so far? He said, "History is indeed little more than the register of the crimes, follies and misfortunes of mankind."  The same can be said about this morning's edition of the New York Times.  The French-Algerian writer Albert Camus, who won a Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, wrote, "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide."  So there's another barrel of laughs from literature. Camus died in an automobile accident. His dates? 1913-1960 A.D.  Listen. All great literature is about what a bummer it is to be a human being: Moby Dick, Huckleberry Finn, The Red Badge of Courage, the Iliad and the Odyssey, Crime and Punishment, the Bible and The Charge of the Light Brigade.  But I have to say this in defense of humankind: No matter in what era in history, including the Garden of Eden, everybody just got there. And, except for the Garden of Eden, there were already all these crazy games going on, which could make you act crazy, even if you weren't crazy to begin with. Some of the games that were already going on when you got here were love and hate, liberalism and conservatism, automobiles and credit cards, golf and girls' basketball.   Even crazier than golf, though, is modern American politics, where, thanks to TV and for the convenience of TV, you can only be one of two kinds of human beings, either a liberal or a conservative.  Actually, this same sort of thing happened to the people of England generations ago, and Sir William Gilbert, of the radical team of Gilbert and Sullivan, wrote these words for a song about it back then:  I often think it's comical How nature always does contrive That every boy and every gal That's born into the world alive Is either a little Liberal Or else a little Conservative.   Which one are you in this country? It's practically a law of life that you have to be one or the other? If you aren't one or the other, you might as well be a doughnut.  If some of you still haven't decided, I'll make it easy for you.  If you want to take my guns away from me, and you're all for murdering fetuses, and love it when homosexuals marry each other, and want to give them kitchen appliances at their showers, and you're for the poor, you're a liberal.  If you are against those perversions and for the rich, you're a conservative.  What could be simpler?   My government's got a war on drugs. But get this: The two most widely abused and addictive and destructive of all substances are both perfectly legal.  One, of course, is ethyl alcohol. And President George W. Bush, no less, and by his own admission, was smashed or tiddley-poo or four sheets to the wind a good deal of the time from when he was 16 until he was 41. When he was 41, he says, Jesus appeared to him and made him knock off the sauce, stop gargling nose paint.  Other drunks have seen pink elephants.  And do you know why I think he is so pissed off at Arabs? They invented algebra. Arabs also invented the numbers we use, including a symbol for nothing, which nobody else had ever had before. You think Arabs are dumb? Try doing long division with Roman numerals.  We're spreading democracy, are we? Same way European explorers brought Christianity to the Indians, what we now call "Native Americans."   How ungrateful they were! How ungrateful are the people of Baghdad today.  So let's give another big tax cut to the super-rich. That'll teach bin Laden a lesson he won't soon forget. Hail to the Chief.  That chief and his cohorts have as little to do with Democracy as the Europeans had to do with Christianity. We the people have absolutely no say in whatever they choose to do next. In case you haven't noticed, they've already cleaned out the treasury, passing it out to pals in the war and national security rackets, leaving your generation and the next one with a perfectly enormous debt that you'll be asked to repay.  Nobody let out a peep when they did that to you, because they have disconnected every burglar alarm in the Constitution: The House, the Senate, the Supreme Court, the FBI, the free press (which, having been embedded, has forsaken the First Amendment) and We the People.   About my own history of foreign substance abuse. I've been a coward about heroin and cocaine and LSD and so on, afraid they might put me over the edge. I did smoke a joint of marijuana one time with Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead, just to be sociable. It didn't seem to do anything to me, one way or the other, so I never did it again. And by the grace of God, or whatever, I am not an alcoholic, largely a matter of genes. I take a couple of drinks now and then, and will do it again tonight. But two is my limit. No problem.  I am of course notoriously hooked on cigarettes. I keep hoping the things will kill me. A fire at one end and a fool at the other.  But I'll tell you one thing: I once had a high that not even crack cocaine could match. That was when I got my first driver's license! Look out, world, here comes Kurt Vonnegut.  And my car back then, a Studebaker, as I recall, was powered, as are almost all means of transportation and other machinery today, and electric power plants and furnaces, by the most abused and addictive and destructive drugs of all: fossil fuels.  When you got here, even when I got here, the industrialized world was already hopelessly hooked on fossil fuels, and very soon now there won't be any more of those. Cold turkey.  Can I tell you the truth? I mean this isn't like TV news, is it?  Here's what I think the truth is: We are all addicts of fossil fuels in a state of denial, about to face cold turkey.  And like so many addicts about to face cold turkey, our leaders are now committing violent crimes to get what little is left of what we're hooked on.    T-OUT

      Well, last night was our last visit to Staples Center for this heart-stopping Laker season.  We've had a great time again this year, and hope we will again next year.  But for now, we'll have to be satisfied with watching the rest of the Finals on TV like most everyone else.   Staples was a crazy scene again last night, and the huge crowd was really buzzin'.  The afternoon/evening started out quite annoying for yours truly.  I was supposed to meet The Huz at Ciudad restaurant downtown for pre-game happy hour & munchies.  I left around 3:45 and the traffic was so bad on the 118 (maybe due to a Presidential casket on view in the hills above?)and then when I approached the downtown area cars were practically at a complete stop....sigh.  THEN I missed my turnoff, 'cause I was all flustered and road-rage-y.  By this time, it was way too late to go to Happy Hour, so I called Huz and told him to meet me at Staples.  Grrr, doubling back, surface streets packed, finally got to Staples and waited out front with the throngs just people-watching til The Huz arrived.  And what a show it is!  I saw people in every kind of Laker fan-related getup you can imagine, lots of big tall guys in stylin' duds--probably some ex-players or sportscaster types, many suits on cell phones, gangsta-lookin' dudes actually wearing giant medallions around the neck...Bling, bling...many amazing looking L.A. women with all the enhancements money can buy.  There was one chick - I almost asked her for a photo - she was wearing a sort of black and red leather bustier thing that laced up (barely), and these low-rise jeans that were ripped all across the thighs - back and front, so really they were more like hot pants.  Anyway, she almost defies description. She was surrounded by many wealthy looking men. Gee I wonder why?  It's all very amusing anyhow.  That's L.A.  So- the Game.  Well, Lakers performance the first half was nerve-wracking.  But they ended up winning in overtime, helped out tremendously by Kobe with an amazing 3- pointer that tied the game.  Luke Walton was indispensable due to his great passing and assists.  And Shaq made 6 crucial points (out of 29 total) in overtime to help clinch it.  We are  thrilled and lucky to have seen one of the most dramatic games in Laker history!    Check out the photos below.  If you want to see the original, large resolution, click on the photo and it will appear bigger and clearer.  My new photo-blogging bot works very well.  Goodbye for now, Staples people, it's been a blast...and  GO LAKERS!!!!!!!    T-OUT

      Tomorrow we're taking off for island paradise for two whole weeks! That's right--it's vacay time. This summer we decided to take both weeks consecutively and spend one week on the Big Island and one week in Kauai.     Last year we decided to stop going to YMCA Family Camp at Sequoia Lake, something we've been doing for one week every summer since Daughter S was a lil' 5 year old sprout. The mountains and lake up there are gorgeous, and there were lots of fun activities too, as well as amazing back-country hiking. But, 8 years was enough. The people were nice too, and we made some friends there, but we need more variety. Especially since Daughter S is plenty old enough now to experience just about any travel adventure. She doesn't need to be entertained by other kids and the last couple of years there she wasn't taking advantage of the activities there anyhow. Plus staying in that dusty cabin caused allergy attacks that I never normally have. And the food was never stellar, to say the least. There were many great things about though--why else would we have gone back so much? For a family with young kids who wants to camp without all the work involved, and have the opportunity for great swimming, fishing, archery, rock climbing, nature activities, and nightly campfire songs and stories, it's a wonderful relaxing and fun experience. All the staff there was unfailingly friendly, capable and knowledgeable. Lotta good folks at Central Valley YMCA. We'll miss seeing you, and our other camper friends.   If anyone reading this wants to have any info on Sequoia Lake for their own family, comment here and I'll hook ya up. It really is a great experience for parents and kids.    So, yeah, instead we're renting houses on 2 Hawaiian Islands - one right over the water in Kona, and the other in the jungle of Kauai's North Shore. Daquiris on the lanai, Baaaaby! Plus we plan on hitting one amazing beach after the other and snorkling, kayaking, hiking around the active volcano, and eating fresh ahi sashimi EVERY NIGHT. And, I booked us on this incredible-sounding Manta Ray night dive. You hold your dive light and the Mantas swoop in to eat the plankton that's attracted by the light. They are just these huge (8 - 14 ft wide) gentle creatures that are so beautiful....I can't wait! I hope we see lots. It will be magical.    Yesterday I got in vacation mode by taking Daughter S and her friend to Paradise Cove Beach in Malibu. I met some pals there and it was a gorgeous day. We just lolled around the beach and ate. I did at least go swimming though, it was very refreshing. Here's a few pictures below.    I'll update when I get back and probably post hideous amounts of vacation photos.  Y'all can't wait, right??  Aloha everyone!     T-OUT

                  Is that the sound of a can hissing or just the gasping of millions of wine snobs?  I saw this advertised today--  "SOFIA"   Champagne, er, I mean sparkling wine, in an adorable pink can, with its own little straw! It's a new offering from the Niebaum-Coppola Winery, and papa Frances has named it after his daughter, director Sofia Coppola. Or their marketing department has. Anyway, as a fairly big supporter of Coppola Wines myself, I think it's a capital idea. They generally put out a good product so why should this be any different?        This is great for those occasions where you just want to do a little toasting without having to consume a whole bottle of Champagne...or try to save the rest for later...which is a pain because the corks never go back in...then you have to hunt around for that metal champagne bottle re-corker you used to have in the back of the drawer...and even if you do find it, those big champagne bottles never fit in you refridgerator properly...so, what the hell, you may just as well drink the rest yourself...except, shit, you did and now you remember that drinking too much champagne causes your acid reflux to act up...but even so you couldn't see wasting the rest of this expensive bubbly...but, whatever, waking up in the middle of the night rooting around for your Zantac is no damn fun.         So yeah, I think I'm gonna check it out. Slave to marketing that I am, I will feel oh-so-very "Sex in the City" while sipping out of this rosy can. Or will I just feel ghetto?           Pop! goes convention.  Let the hissing begin.    T-OUT

        The self-proclaimed "Greatest Rock Band in the World" - Tenacious D in da House!! (aka Jack Black and Kyle Gass)   Click on any photo below to enlarge.    urlLink     Last  week, the Huz and I attended a John Kerry Fundraiser concert at the  Henry Fonda theater in Hollywood. It was hosted by Alex &amp; Vanessa  Kerry, and emceed by comedian/writer Bob Odenkirk. Young Hollywood  (plus some of us Democratic Suburbanites) were out in force. There was  a great and hilarious performance by Tenacious D (Jack Black &amp; Kyle  Gass), as well as the wonderful Dave Grohl and Liz Phair. There were  some celebrities in attendance, so they had the requisite red carpet  and phalanx of news media. We had a super time and felt damn good about  it too! Here's some photos I took whilst dodging security.   urlLink      Dave Grohl = amazing songwriter.    urlLink      I love Jack Black.    urlLink     Tenacious D vs. Cheney, Bush, Spiderman &amp; Sasquatch.  (You had to be there.)    urlLink     Rock on, JB and the D!!      Vote for John Kerry!    T-OUT

      Long time no update.  I meant to post this 2 weeks ago, but I seem to have had trouble concentrating on certain stuff lately.  I started writing in intermittent fits, only to be called away or otherwise distracted...oh well, here's my ramblings on this controversial film, etc.  My family and I, along with Daughter S's friend, J-Dawg, attended a 5 pm matinee showing of the film on opening weekend.  I was pleasantly suprised to see a full theater in  Simi Valley , of all places, not exactly a bastion of liberalism!  It felt good as the movie progressed to be around so many others with similar views and questioning minds.    So, I saw this film and I was so incredibly pissed off, I wanted to spit tacks.  It is painful to think of what that SOB Bush and his band of thugs and liars have done to this great country.  And Michael Moore gives you ALL the facts: the Bush-Saudi-Bin Laden links, the ineffectiveness before, during and after 9-11, the ties to Big Oil, the botching of Afghanistan, the rush to invade Iraq, and the human costs of it all.  Moore knows how to hit all the notes, and he knows how to show you the emotional toll that this is taking on so many people, indeed, the whole country.  I would like to specifically mention two moments in the film.  The first, following the credits, recounts the events of the morning of 9-11.  The attacks are not shown, they are heard against a black screen.  Yes, the sounds of the first jetliner hitting the WTC, and then the sounds of the second jet hitting the other tower.  And then it's just heart-wrenching images of millions of papers and debris flying through the dusty air in slow motion. It is a very powerful way to portray the tragedy of that morning.  We all have our memories of that day.  We all felt the horror, the fear, the helplessness. This is brought to life again in an extremely artful and meaningful way.  The second moment was when Lila Lipscomb, an average American woman and patriot who lost her son in Iraq, reads a letter from him that he wrote the day before he was killed in Karbala. Her son writes about how  futile the war effort is and that it all seems completely senseless.  He urges her to vote against Bush in the next election.  As she reads the letter, we see firsthand her disillusionment and grief over the meaningless death of her beloved son.  I don't think there was a dry eye in the house, as they say.   I think Michael Moore has created an agitprop tour-de-force. I have always been against the Thief-in-Chief, and personally, there wasn't too much that I didn't already know. But it was so awesome to hear people booing Bush and company, and then the cheers went up at the end. This film is an antidote to our so-called liberal media that soft-pedalled the incompetency of the Shrub Junta and acted as cheerleaders for this goddamned war. Coming out of the theater, I also felt angry at my fellow Americans who have their heads in the sand and are oblivious to what is going on over there in Iraq, and with the Bushies, preferring to drown it out with local news, ESPN and mindless entertainment.   Wake up.  Get that smarmy frat boy OUT.    T-OUT

      I changed my Blogger template / layout from sunny orangey to this pinkish rose theme. I'm not sure I like it...plus the comment feature is kinda annoying...if you don't have a Blogger account you have to post anonymously. Not that I get that many comments, but. So if you want to vote on the layout or leave a comment, just do it anonymously and then put your name in it if you wish.  I'm just trying to make my blog more exciting looking. Yeah, you say, but what about the content??? How 'bout you make THAT interesting??? Well, I'm working within my limited cognitive capacity here, people.  If you want to see something hilarious, go  urlLink  here.  There is this video of Will Ferrell impersonating Dubya that is a riot. Daughter S's boyfriend sent it to her. I knew I liked that kid.  Next post will be my Kauai pictures.  I know you all are waiting with bated keyboard, or something.   T - OUT

      I'm baaaaaaack! So, be jealous, we just spent 2 very relaxing and enjoyable weeks in Hawaii. So great to spend quality time with The Huz and Daughter S. As I type this I'm in the process of uploading an ungodly amount of photos to my ofoto account so friends and fam can gape with wonder at the beauty that is Hawaii. Either that or die of boredom. You know, with digital cameras you can take just about unlimited shots of everything in various formats and worry about deleting later...and since I bought some extra large memory cards, we were set for maximum documenting of every moment of our trip.  The first week was spent on the Big Island (as previously noted). We stayed in Kona in a semi-great location over the ocean. We had this deck / lanai for wonderful max chill-axin'...snorkeling right in front, amazing sunsets, breakfast, lunch, happy hour, etc etc. And, the house next door was totally unoccupied and had a pool available for my refreshment. Mwahahahah. There is something just so incredibly decadent about a pool on the ocean. I love it. The part about this house that wasn't so good was the traffic noise. Grrr. It happened to be on Ali'i Dr. which is the main drag in and out of Kona...so if you weren't on the ocean side of the house it was like VRRRRROOOOOOOMMMMM. From 6 - 7 AM to 10 PM. Who knew?  We visited several gorgeous beaches and did some fab snorkeling in Keleakakua Bay around the Capt. Cook monument. Major dolphin action as we kayaked over. The bay is their resting place, and they're everywhere, large and small. Leaping and playing. Scattering spray like handfuls of jewels. Pushing through blue green crystal water, a symbol of joy and magic and ultimate freedom. So wonderful to see. When we got across to the monument, the snorkeling was unparalleled. 100 ft. of visibility and tons of tropical fish, turtles, and eels. Lotta people too! But it was great.  We also went out to do the Manta Ray Night Dive while in Kona. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out too well - for me. I haven't gone scuba diving in a few years, but since it was only a 25-30 ft. I wasn't worried about it. The dive master, Mark, assured me it was very easy also. Anyhow, we got down there and sat on the bottom with our dive lights waiting for the Rays to show up. (It's not guaranteed). Anyhow, the Rays weren't appearing after 15-20 min., so we were supposed to swim and do a regular night dive. Only my leg cramped up somethin' awful and then I couldn't work my BC very well, and inflated it too much and the next thing I knew I was on the surface!! Now with cramps in BOTH legs. And I'm starting to have a panic attack because it's dark and my group (including The Huz) won't know where I went. And I couldn't get my BC to deflate to go back down....then Daughter S came snorkeling by ( she wasn't diving-she was gonna view the Rays from up top) and she was very sweet and calm to a semi-hysterical mom with severe cramps...and we went back to the boat. The boat captain was surprised to see me, and I was so embarassed! I got on, and S went back snorkeling. Then like 10 min. later, Dive Master Mark came up and was like "Is she here?????!!!!" 'Cause of course he was looking for me when I didn't turn up in the count. So I apologized and he went back down with the group while I sat there all sheepish - like and bummed out. Anyway, it turns out they only saw one Ray. And I saw none. Sucks. Well at least The Huz and Daughter S saw it.  After 5 days in the Kona area we split and went to Volcano. Stayed in an historical B & B run by this very interesting couple in their 80's and their daughter. Beautiful place, very peaceful. We hiked across Kilauea Iki Crater and also hiked to the active lava flow. Daughter S and I took about 321385644373099 pictures of the lava drip, drop, dripping into the ocean. Clouds of steam rose over boiling water as the hot bright glowing orange lava entered the ocean along a ledge next to a newly created black sand beach. It's like having front row seats to a primordial stage. There's few places in the world where a human can walk beside a lava flow, hear it crackle and hiss and watch new land being formed. As dusk turned to dark, we could see the advancing lava flows open up in different areas on the bench above the sea, constantly changing into underwater lightning. Yeah, it was cool. Then we got to hike back over the 2 miles of hardened lava rock in the dark with a flashlight. Not too bad, but then again yours truly is the klutz queen of the universe. That's right- I tripped and fell once. Banged my knee and tore my pants. No adventure we ever do is complete without a mishap from me. Oh well.  SO  worth it!  I'm gonna post Part 2 - The Kauai Week - later. Below here are some pictures from the Big Island though. As usual, click on the pic to see the large size.  Aloha and mahalo.
