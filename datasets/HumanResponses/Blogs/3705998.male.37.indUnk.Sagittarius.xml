         My first reaction was one of  Oasis  trying to be  AC/DC . I still hear that mostly, but shades of  Great White  and the  Black Crowes  rear their heads too. Other than a mid-album lull with a few ballads, this rawks.

         Another contender for best album of 2004, this is a gem. It's hard edged pop for  Beatles  fans who sided with Paul rather than John. Not as immediately catchy as his debut album, or his work in  The Semantics , after a couple of spins it doesn't matter as it quickly joins its brethren as some of the best power pop ever made.

         It's odd, but when I get in an 80s mood these days, I find myself spinning discs like this (and others of the then called modern rock genre). Maybe because it's new to me, but a lot of these bands really did create some good tunes. Problem was that the fans were just so annoying. Many still are.

         Classy 1993 debut from this Aussie popster...all the songs here are great but  Not A Day Goes  by is the stuff of mixdisc dreams!

         The band that would eventually morph into Invertigo finished off the 80s with this excellent pop rocker. Ten very infectious keyboard driven tunes, it remains one of my all time favorites.

         Another much maligned disc that I happen to LOVE. Personally I think  Def Leppard  stole much of their  Hysteria  and beyond sound from this album. The band is tight, the songs are tight. It was huge worldwide. Why did it flop here in the States?

         Their first disc was OK in that "had its moments" sort of way, but really nothing that great. This one, on the other hand, is miles beyond. Superb melodies throughout. Actually reminds me a bit of a modern day  Iron Maiden .

         This  ELO  offshoot produced one of THE most satisfying listens to ever grace my ears. Not a week goes by where I don't listen to this at least once. Shame it's next to impossible to get a hold of anymore...I would LOVE to replace my CDR with a proper CD. If your tastes run along the classic pop sounds of  ELO, Wings, Jellyfish,  etc. than this is worth hunting down at almost any cost.

         I saw on a message board somewhere accusing  Butch Walker  of trying to be Dashboard Confessional SO I figured I would give them a spin to see what they hype was all about. While I really don't see the comparison too greatly, this is some rather good modern rock. Some songs are instant toe tappers while others have that feeling that they need a few spins to properly get a handle on. This is a band I plan to investigate further.

         One of the biggest crimes in music over the past few years was the band's  So Happily Unsatisfied  getting shelved by Sony. So the band is now releasing music on their own, and starts off with a winner. Catchy, upbeat modern radio rock...crafted for singledom and I'm sure relegated to cult status.

      Jean Beauvoir, prolific artist of Plasmatics, Voodoo X, Little Steven and Crown Of Thorns fame is to release his first real solo album in years on Frontiers Records and ulfTone music.  Entitled "Chameleon", Beauvoir could not have found a more fitting title. As diverse as the artist himself, this album features Beauvoir stepping effortlessly over stylistical borders without ever missing a beat. From the opening chords of the Lionel Richie co-write "I wanna know (incl. excerpt of "You")" to the closing lines of "Angel", Beauvoir touches the limits of musical imagination whilst retaining his strongest blessing: writing hooklines that are catchy without losing depth.  After having focused on hard rock material with his own band "Crown Of Thorns", this album brings back the Beauvoir that had worldwide #1 success with the single "Feel The Heat" and the successive album "Drums Along The Mohawk" and that wrote countless hits for artists as diverse as KISS, The Ramones (including the single off the movie "School Of Rock"), N-Sync and many others; this time mixing it with state-of-the-art production and remarkable diversity in the songwriting.  Jean Beauvoir is definitely back full strength with “Chameleon” which includes the following tracks:  urlLink I Wanna Know (incl. excerpt from You) ;  urlLink Higher ; I Don't Need Ya; Where The River Runs Deep; I Want To Lay Here; Something To Believe In; Even More; Addicted To Us;  urlLink Dying End ; Teenager; Amazing; Angel.  Who knows, maybe "Chameleon" will bring the long-awaited success that peers and fans have been knowing should have happened all along...  Release date is scheduled for August 30th on Frontiers Records worldwide, except for Germany, Austria and Switzerland where the release will be handled via ulfTone Music/Edel.

         What is it about all these misc. Pop Idol runner ups that allow them to create such killer pop rock albums? Aussie Shannon Noll's debut is quite  Bryan Adam's -ish.  A quick tally:  Clay Aiken, Jamie Meyer, Billy Klippert, Kurt Nielsen  and  Shannon Noll ...all pop idols and all released great albums.

         Much maligned and highly underrated, it remains my favorite Night Ranger album. Released with almost zero promotion, songs like  Color Of Your Smile, Rain Comes Crashing Down  and  Hearts Away  should have ruled radio/video. Probably the band's most AOR effort. Oh well...

         Could this be the best album of 2004? Might be rabbit...might be. As it stands now, it's my favorite so far. How can you go wrong with tunes like  Axl Rose, In Your Eyes, 1985  or  All American ? And that's just scratching the surface of this lyrically superior nu-breed killer.  Though right now it's only a Japanese release, it will be released in a different form in the US under the name of  urlLink Mitch Allan  titled  Clawing My Way To The Middle .

         I remain a fan of the band's debut album but I was a little skeptical that, especially in this disposable day and age, the duo could pull off another good album. Happy to say they have and more. After a week or so, I find that I am enjoying this disc a lot. It's typical modern radio rock, but done very well. I'm a sucker for a good chorus and every song on here has a sweeping feeling of grandness (how's that for a cliche?). Mainstream critics may balk, but fuck 'em. It's not like they ever had good taste anyways...

         I took a chance on this because of their past associate with the awesome  Spymob . Now, this is NOTHING like  Spymob  but this is decent for what it is (which is hip hop with a rock instrumentation). I doubt I'll listen to this much in full, but to grab a song here or there for a mix, it's alright. I think their problem is they are trying to be all things to all people and it becomes a scattered mess.

But it's pretty dead on:  [1]  Van Halen  -  1  [2]  Extreme  -  Pornograffitti  [3]  Harem Scarem  -  Mood Swings  [4]  Guns N' Roses  -  Appetite For Destruction   The only problem is neither of us can come up with Number 5. There's  Metallica's   Master Of Puppets ,  Iron Maiden's   Powerslave ,  Ozzy's   Blizzard Of Ozz ...any takers?

         Frontiers Records is very proud to present RICHIE KOTZEN new solo album entitled “Get Up”!  Richie is an accomplished guitar player and singer who has played with such multi-platinum selling bands such as  POISON  (on “Native Tongue” in 1993) and  MR. BIG  (on the studio releases “Get Over It” and “Actual Size”).  As a solo artist he started even earlier with an all-instrumental album for Shrapnel Records in 1989, followed by several other releases, which helped him in creating a reputation as one of the most creative, original and gifted musicians around.   In time, Richie has also explored and developed his vocal abilities and his brand new album “Get Up” is a testament to a mature musician and songwriter.  The new album includes eleven smokin’ hard rock tracks with great emphasis on riveting guitar riffs, hooklines that stick like glue and – of course – amazing solos.  Tracklisting of the Frontiers version is as follows:  urlLink Losin' My Mind ;  urlLink Fantasy  ; Remember;  urlLink Get Up ; So Cold; Such A Shame; Made For Tonight; Still; Never Be The Same; Special; Blame On Me*  *Exclusive bonus track  “Get Up” will see the light of day on August 30th 2004.

         Had I never stopped doing SFK, this would have been my #1 album of 2003. It's an extremely strong and tight set of modern AOR tunes that come across like a heavier  Savage Garden   and are very comparable to  Invertigo . There's not a song here that shouldn't have ruled radio (if it had come out on a major label with some publicity mind you). Just tap into  Me & You  or  When You Hold My Hand ...  According to the  urlLink band's website , they are finishing up a new album, tentaively titled  Hanging By A Thread .

         Eric Martin is one of those guys who can do little wrong by me. I liked his poppy 80s tunes, loved his work with Mr. Big and continue to enjoy his nu-breed noodlings in his modern day solo career. He's just got one of those voices that can make almost anything sound good. I think, if anything, he benefits from not being surrounded with musicians who can overpower the song.

It's quickly joining the eternal ranks of one of my all-time faves.   The band will be releasing an EP on June 29.  1.22.03 Acoustic  is a live acoustic set recorded by the band at the Hit Factory in New York City in January of 2003 and also features a bonus live track of the band performing AC/DC's  Highway to Hell  recorded in Germany. The tracklisting is:  This Love, Sunday Morning, She Will Be Loved, Harder to Breathe, The Sun, If I Fell  (Beatles Cover) and  Highway to Hell .

         Funny, but when I first started listening to this back in 2002 (when it came out), I enjoyed it for it's total Def Leppard-isms. Listening now, I hear a lot of Enuff Z'nuff in here too. Still a thoroughly enjoyable listen and just the thing for a breezy summer day.

         Listening to something like this makes you realize how lame AOR became in the 90s. The music of bands like Loverboy, along with Foreigner, Journey and Survivor still hold up very well almost 20 years on. Think we'll be saying the same about Intruder, Jaded Heart or any of the other countless releases that flooded the markets around 95 or so?

         Maybe it's the AOR junkie in me, but I always found Magnum's best period to be between the albums  On A Storyteller's Night  and  Goodnight LA . Of those four discs, three are featured here, along with a few b-sides, live cuts and remixes. No one combined the worlds of prog, pomp and AOR quite like these guys did...and I don't think anyone has yet (did that make sense?).

         This is a sweet little 2CD promo item I picked up off of  urlLink eBay . While Disc1 is just the US version of  Vault , Disc2 is an excellent collection of almost hits and misc. album tracks from  On Through The Night  right up to  Adrenalize . It was released to promote  Euphoria . Maybe it's because I've heard all the big hits so many times before, that I actually find myself listening to Disc2 more these days. Songs like  Tear It Down, Run Riot  and  Stagefright  still rock my mullet!  Word has it that they may release some sort of all covers disc in the future.  If you're REALLY bored, check out what may be the lamest  urlLink interview  of all time, with Phil Collen.

         Those of you old-time SFK'ers are no doubt familiar with this disc, and my history with it. Amazing how well it still holds up today, glammy power pop with some of the best lyrics/songwriting of all time. Listening to this sparked a discussion between me and my buddy Bryan, and in turn we had found out that singer  Shane  had actually recorded an album after this called "Blue Movie". I'm working on getting a copy now.

         Yeah, I'm back. I know I said I was retiring for good, but then again, I've said that before. Most likely, I'll say it again.  So what happened to the  SFK  name? Well,  THAT  I did retire. I felt that that name might have been too restrictive. I want to blather on about more than just music (though a good majority of the posts will be about melodic rock that you know me for).  Why not continue the e-mail edition? I felt that also would be too restrictive and this will be a lot easier for me to post (and update on a whim).  The main reason I decided to "come back" is that there is just  SO  much good music out there that's just not being written about anywhere (with no disrespect meant to anyone out there). And I'm going to try and get as much of it exposed as I can. Mostly, that will be through my  NP  (or Now Playing) updates. I'll also flip bits of news and etc. that I come across throughout my day of trying to avoid doing any actual work at my job.

The first single from it is a cover of The Cars' classic "Just What I Needed"  The new album will be their second on their new label home, Sixthman Records, after parting ways with Atlantic Records in 2001.  Their last release, "Chasing Daylight" was one of the first successful non-major label releases in recent memory.  Through avid touring, strong support from their label, and past radio success, Sister Hazel was able to pick up decent radio play, and have considerably great sales numbers on the album.

She's not even that big a celebrity, but this freakshow of a sex tape is just awe inspiring at how deranged it is. So this slut's husband video taped them banging right after she got new breast implants, and I gotta say... they look HORRIBLE. Like someone nailed two fucking potatoes to her damn chest. I wish I had more hands so I could give them titties four thumbs down! So she's posing for the camera, while her insensitive husband tries to bang her on cam. This is the most un-erotic video I've ever fucking seen. This is such a dysfunctional porno. She bites his penis while calling him Daddy, then accidentally kicks him in the nuts. Then she slaps him and calls him a creep while telling him to stop because he's hurting her. You gotta see it for yourself, it's just so twisted and white trash.

       urlLink Popbang.com    ArtistOfTheMonth  The Thornbirds "All the Same"(warrior records) This is the CD that was made for the summer of 2004! 12 solid songs that the volume knob was invented for! The reviews for this debut CD from this talented San Diego band have been killer, and you are about to read why! If you're a fan of melodic pop that has a ton of energy and harmony (like us), this debut will wear out your CD player like it has ours! The lead off track, "All The Same" is radio ready and is leaps and bounds above most of the generic mush that saturates poor FM radio listener's ears. The closing track, the beautiful "Thought You Should Know" is the type of high quality melodic ballad that would come from Geoff Byrd or Kyle Vincent. The CD's highlight (and there are plenty of them) is the Enuff Z'nuff inspired "Better You Than Me", the hit that Chip and Donnie have always been wanting to write, but haven't yet. Arguably the best CD of the season, this is a "must have" for fans of The Argument, Enuff Z'nuff, Magna-fi, Bleu, Billionaire Boys Club, Hindu Rodeo, and other artists that make premium power pop. Absolutely, no doubt, really superb fantastic A+ stuff!!  SingleOfTheWeek!  Stratocruiser "Crystalized" Following up their awesome EP from the spring, Stratcruiser gets ready to launch the full length "Suburban Contemporary". Fans of Love Nut, The Posies and The Andersons know what I'm talking about when I say that Stratocruiser is the real deal! If this track is any indication of what the whole CD is going to be like, we are ready for one very rockin' fall! "Crystalized" is 2 minutes and 50 seconds of really big time good stuff!  Also new on Popbang Radio this week is new music from The Frauds, The Fags, Skyblynde, Spinning Jennies, Heath Haynes, and more!

       urlLink Web Forum    Kyle Vincent  answers a message board post about his past catalog (including the  Candy  album):   I've made offers to buy back the rights to the Trust album, the Hollywood album, and even the Candy album, as recently as last year, but record companies have strange rules about that stuff...they want to recoup close to what they have/had into the projects...so unless someone wants to paypal me about a zillion dollars, it ain't a-gonna happen for now. Maybe after they all go out of business I can buy them back at the MCA garage sale.  Howevuh, my son, this new album I think you're gonna put up there with the Hollywood one..there's some nice power poppy stuff, some intense but less slick ballads, and some sparse new direction junk as well. I'll sneak a sampler/teaser out there as soon as I can.

According to the Daily Telegraph, Bono said that they'd be willing to release the record early, rather than face an online leak four months before release.  He said: "If it is on the Internet this week, we will release it immediately as a legal download on iTunes, and get hard copies into the shops by the end of the month. It would be a real pity. It would screw up years of work and months of planning, not to mention f**king up our holidays. But once it's out, it's out."

Was there a finer ballad from that era than  New Moon ?   Diving For Pearls  should be releasing their new one on Atenzia this year.

Consequently, Kiss is more than ever The Gene and Paul Show, which appears to be just fine with bassist Gene Simmons and frontman Paul Stanley, who have become even greater focal points of a band that was built 31 years ago on four distinct personalities and visual icons.

         Hey, any album that features  Andy Sturmer  gets my immediate attention.  Bleu  is a bit  Jellyfish -like I suppose, but with a much more modern and cutting edge.  Owsley  is probably a better comparison point, but even that really doesn't do justice here. It's modern singer/songwriter power pop (hmm, can I cram any more genres in there?). I have the original version released on Aware, but Sony reissued this with two new tunes (and cut three). You really can't go wrong with either.

         In 1987  The Alarm  flirted with hi-tech AOR and the sound actually suited them. Songs like  Rain In The Summertime, Rescue Me  and  Presence Of Love  were some of the best yet ignored singles of that year. Unfortunately I'm still sitting on my copy of this CD from 1987, I really need to pick up the Expanded and Remastered 2CD set.

         A 2-fer-1 on one cd...skinny tie power pop meets AOR "keyboard glories". Catchy as a head cold, it's another one of those discs that you just can't be in a bad mood when you're finished.  (Added comment) Ya know, as I'm about 3/4 through listening, I'm realizing that the good songs are really good but they're few and far between, which may have clouded my memory. It's been a while since I listened to this and it hasn't aged well at all.

Now the band is planning a fourth, the piano-driven "Sunday Morning."  When Maroon 5 return to the studio in early 2005, it will have been a long time since they made a record, but the band has been warming up, cutting a couple of covers for upcoming compilations. They did "Everyday People" for a Sly Stone tribute album and "Pure Imagination" from "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" for a benefit.

In between working on his 9th solo album and session work, Joe is looking forward to having fun singing some classics that he always loved. His first full-length appearance with Hit Squad is THIS SATURDAY AUGUST 14.  The idea for Hit Squad was born last summer when Byrd and DeVitto had a casual conversation . It turned out they were off the road and itchin' to play out live! So they gathered up a bunch of "like minded pirates," including JLT. Ricky elaborates on the concept, "We're going to be playing the stuff we played when we first started out, before the Business became part of the Music. No record companies, publishers, booking agents. This is about having fun, no strings attached."  The repertoire will consist of songs such as "I'll go Crazy," "Little Queenie," "Girl Can't help It," "My Girl," "That's How Strong My Love Is" and "Route 66." Byrd continues, "And maybe, just maybe, we'll throw in a few songs from our respective checkered pasts! I'm thinkin' this is gonna be fun!!!" Liberty adds, "I think this is gonna be the most fun I've had playing in a long time!" Based on availability the revolving band consists of:  Liberty DeVitto - drums (Billy Joel) Ricky Byrd - guitar &amp; vocals (Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, Roger Daltrey, Ian Hunter) Richie Cannata - horns (Billy Joel, Beach Boys) Andy Burton - keyboards (Ian Hunter) Andy York - guitar (John Mellencamp, Ian Hunter) Joe Lynn Turner - vocals (Deep Purple, Rainbow) Simon Kirke - drums (Bad Company, Free) Kasim Sulton - bass &amp; vocals (Joan Jett, Utopia, Meat Loaf) Hugh McDonald - bass & vocals (Bon Jovi) Charly Drayton - bass (X-pensive Winos, Michelle Branch) Fernando Saunders - bass &amp; vocals (Lou Reed, Jeff Beck) Christine Ohlman- vocals (Saturday Night Live Band) Arno Hecht - horns (Stones)

I was born 17 March 1975" he states in response to a fan's question.  However, Justin may be lying to the kids.  He revealed to some celebrity friends that he's 34.

       urlLink Thunder Online    The recording of the new Thunder album is now well a truly underway.  The as yet untitled record is being produced by Luke and the engineer is Rupert Coulson (with some additional knob twiddling from our very own Ben).  Recording has been under way since the beginning of June, stopping and starting to write more songs and play some festivals in Europe and the UK.  The band hope to have it all done by the end of August, with a single release in November (to coincide with the Deep Purple U.K. arena tour) and the full album to follow in the spring of 2005.  Some of the new tunes set to be included are as follows:  I Love You More Than Rock 'n' Roll - A very catchy rocker, as anyone who's seen the band perform over the summer will already know!  Currently favourite for the first single...  I'm Dreaming Again - Aerosmith style power ballad.  Fade Into The Sun - Very dramatic and up tempo.  Monkey See, Monkey Do - Luke in Jimmy Page mode, damning indictment of record labels, all vitriol and misery (in the best possible way).  You Can't Keep A Good Man Down - ROCK!!  Together Or Apart - The fans are going to love this one!  The natural successor to Love Walked In!?!?  A Fatal Kiss - co-written with Russ Ballard.

         Whoogah! Not only have three ex members of  Creed  found a killer vocalist in Myles Kennedy, they have gone on to record what may wind up being my favorite album of 2004. Seriously. This is an amazing set of tunes that while having a bit of  Creed  to them are actually closer in sound to  Skid Row's   Slave To The Grind  and  Soundgarden's   Superunknown . Myles Kennedy is miles above Scott Stapp and actually resembles Bruce Dickinson and Geoff Tate more than anything a modern vocalist sounds like these days. He's quite the wailer. Catchy riffs, pretty decent lead breaks and classic styled hard rock...yup, this just may be my album of 2004!
