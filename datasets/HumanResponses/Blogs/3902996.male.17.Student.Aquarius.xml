       Happiness, very reluctant to show itself in my life  Bitterness, not a fun experience  Love, Never experienced  Infatuation, too many times...... once is too many in my opinion  Hate, Very few people, but when i do, it tends to stick  Dissappointment, more and more everyday  Confusion, everyday of my life is filled with this one  Acceptance, a trait that is very useful, but very hard to come by  Grief, this one goes hand in hand with confusion  Sadness, it's there everyday, sometimes you just dont see it  Invisiblity, sometimes it seems as if i were  Anger, Seems to show through, even when i try to hide it  Hope, fades with each passing day  Indifference, a feeling that you learn to live with  Stress, Something that you must learn to deal with while you are at OSSM  ________________________________________________________________   Well, that was interesting, by the time i got to the end of it, i ran out of emotions/ feelings. I will try to update that continuously as they change, but i think for the moment, they are set.  well i volunteered today.... boring as usual, but all the people left at about 12, so i sat around and played computer games till about 12:45 or so... then i went outside and waited for amber. Me, Jacob, Amber, Kim, and another guy who's name escapes me went out to eat in norman. it was interesting, heard some weird stories, met some people. but the thing was that there were 5 people in a camaro, if i had know that i would be packed in a car Asian style, i would have dressed for the occasion... but i was in long pants... and it was 100 degrees outside, and i had to sit on this really uncomfortable hump in the back seat... overall it was fun. yea, well i got dropped off first, and i always love the reaction of people seeing my house and my neighborhood for the first time. that's always fun!   so.... my personal deadline for finishing the Iliad didnt work out so well, so i am just gonna try to finish it either tomorrow, or sometime this weekend.    WIN A DATE WITH....   HEYA's bachelor/bachelorette auction, Friday July 23 at 7pm at ST. ANDREW DUNG LAC CHURCH.&nbsp; Stay tune for directions!!&nbsp; Date wins a candlelight dinner in the park.&nbsp; Score!!&nbsp; All profits go to Deacon Vu Thanh An's Charity Organization.&nbsp; If you want to be an auctionee which we really need, please im   gqklown102  ,   Cremona1644  , or   PhAnMaN362     I KNOW! it's at the church....... i am pretty sure that we can do it.... i have been assured....   so this weekend, i found out that i am helping my sisters with a carwash that thier sorority is throwing, Everyone who wants a car wash, IM me and i will give you the location.   ________________________________________________________________  &nbsp;   Song of the Day - KoRn - Freak on a Leash   Something takes a part of me  Something lost and never seen  Everytime I start to believe  Something's raped and taken from me...from me  Life's gotta always be messing with me  &nbsp;  Can't they chill and let me be free  Can't I take away all this pain I try to every night, all in vain...in vain  Sometimes I cannot take this place  Sometimes it's my life I can't taste  Sometimes I cannot feel my face  You'll never see me fall from grace  Something takes a part of me  &nbsp;  You and I were meant to be  A cheap fuck for me to lay  Something takes a part of me  Feeling like a freak on a leash  Feeling like I have no release  &nbsp;  How many times have I felt diseased Nothing in my life is free...is free  Sometimes I cannot take this place  Sometimes it's my life I can't taste  Sometimes I cannot feel my face  You'll never see me fall from grace  Something takes a part of me  You and I were meant to be  Part of me  Part of me  Part of me   ________________________________________________________________   well thats about it for tonight.... i will keep you informed on any changes in my mundane life   Peace

      Wow, I am new to this whole Blogger.com stuff. it's pretty cool :-)  I am used to xanga, but I guess with this I have a little more freedom  I really don't know why I am up this late, but while I am, I better do something, so I guess that's why I am typing now!  tomorrow, I will be volunteerin at the hospital, and on Wednesday I get to go hang out with Mary, and I think we are having lunch with Amber too...... That should be fun  Great, I will be at lunch with 2 cool girls, should be interesting..... Both I like, but I don't really know what to do from that point. I guess it seems like everytime I move forward with these type of feelings, I always get rejected, or horrible embarrassed... Or in some cases, completely ignored.... And trust me, that last one hurts the most, especially for me. I assume that's just because I always imagine like the perfect relationship, you know, all the corny stuff and when I don't get it I get disappointed. I only have myself to blame for that.  sigh, enough about my "matters of the heart" time to go to bed!

       Who was i foolin? Why did I ever think that I could do it? Why does it always have to be me? Why do I insist on going for the ones that are..... never interested? _________________________________________________________________  i guess if i think about it the only person i was foolin, was myself....... I think before, i still believed in that little thing called hope, sadly enough my hope has been shattered just about as many times as heart. a couple more times though..... OSSM tends to shatter hopes faster than anything else  i would have to say that it is always me because, well the world is never fair.... why should it be any different for me?  on the subject of why do i go after the uninterested ones...... you know the saying "You always want what you cant have?" well that's what happened with me, on many occasions...... i always pick the one that are out of my league, i dunno if it is stupidity, or ego.... either way not gonna happen anymore, hopefully...  it's a funny thing... when you are try so hard for someone's attention, that you are doing crazy things.... and then it turns out that someone either doesnt care or doesnt even know. you know what hurts the most, if they dont even know... cause that just means you did everything for nothing  sigh..... well like my friend said, "The Past is....... Past" i guess it's true, that past the i try to put in the past always comes back to bite me in the ass....   well, i better wrap this heart-felt entry up.....    :-(
