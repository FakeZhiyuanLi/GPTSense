						    urlLink The Onion | I Should Not Be Allowed To Say The Following Things About America   So I saw Farenheit 9/11 the other day, sadly it showed me nothing new about the state of this country under the reign of the shrub. The movie just reiterated my initial suspicions and concerns about the agenda of the Bush Administration. Concerns that had been shaken by ignorant neo-conservative relatives, peers, and media talking heads. But things are much better now, Bush now has the lowest approval rating since his term began. Kerry isn't exactly the messiah, but he is the lesser of the two evils.     Politics aside, the movie re-energized my will to do something about the state of things around here. In Farenheit, there was footage of an Iraqi woman mourning her relatives, crushed under their leveled home in a time of American bombing. She was praying to Allah and claiming that ONLY HE could help her and Iraq. I sat there and realized..."No, we can help. WE can do something about this. OUR vote, OUR words, OUR actions and the lack thereof were, and continue to be responsible in the death and maiming of hundreds daily. AS AMERICANS, not only do we have the power to be mindful of the world community and how each and every one of our actions create repercussions that are felt globally, but we have the RESPONSIBILITY to care and do something."       None of our actions are isolated, none of our decisions are an island of ignorant bliss.   Here's something I wrote a few months ago. I think it has something to do with what I have been talking about. I read it at the Bard Contest and felt it impacted some people so I'm going to put it up here. I feel a little self-indulgent and pretentious to be throwing this up here, but nobody reads this blog anyway. so here goes-    See You In Gitmo    Torrents of steel cast by tyrants pummel our people out of house and home Crimson floods drown their humble abodes Shed blood of opposing foes flows as one throughout the hate-scorched cracks of chapped, arid land and glass of melted sand  When, and if, the victor chooses his spoils, claims war as the will of his god; so loyal declares his crusade as pursuit of divinity; and oil He will hang tainted, stained, sand-glass panes borne of pain in his house of worship bearing the names of the "who-art-in-heaven" martyrs But a "Road to Peace" paved with the slain and deceased  will never appease and release the ceaseless grip of the iron fist  Men of will, men of greed, sowing the seeds of the money tree They will kill, weed out the weak to seek their own Garden of Eden With every shell the iron fist sells to sear the skin of the infidel it whores off more of itself straight off the retail shelf then hoards everything else for some fleeting wealth  Hindsight is 20/20 in this empty land of plenty we can spend the spent when the means is the end lives in supply, lives in demand, our lives are the fat of the land History is cyclical when the sickle you pick to mow and thresh what you know is swung solely for tonight's harvest moon So, soon, we will reap what has been sown and we will find ourselves alone.

						   Well it's summer now. I'm already bored. Sunoco can only fit me in on Saturday mornings so I have the rest of the week to find something productive or at least entertaining to do. And that explains this blog.

						    urlLink Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse: A searchable online version at The Literature Network    Read Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse, it's one of the most important books I've ever read. Here's an excerpt-   "Did you," so he asked him at one time, "did you too learn that secret from the river: that there is no time?"   Vasudeva's face was filled with a bright smile.   "Yes, Siddhartha," he spoke. "It is this what you mean, isn't it: that the river is everywhere at once, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the sea, in the mountains, everywhere at once, and that there is only the present time for it, not the shadow of the past, not the shadow of the future?"   "This it is," said Siddhartha. "And when I had learned it, I looked at my life, and it was also a river, and the boy Siddhartha was only separated from the man Siddhartha and from the old man Siddhartha by a shadow, not by something real. Also, Siddhartha's previous births were no past, and his death and his return to Brahma was no future. Nothing was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has existence and is present."   Siddhartha spoke with ecstasy; deeply, this enlightenment had delighted him.  Oh, was not all suffering time, were not all forms of tormenting oneself and being afraid time, was not everything hard, everything hostile in the world gone and overcome as soon as one had overcome time, as soon as time would have been put out of existence by one's thoughts?

						    urlLink Albert Einstein quotes    Correction- I worded my "God is not; You are" post&nbsp;incorrectly. I am not an atheist, rather, I am a deist. I believe in a higher order and the harmony of all things, but the universe is not controlled by some exterior force. The universe is a self-contained system, otherwise known as nature. So, in that sense, I am an atheist but still believe in some indeterminate spiritual force that bonds all things together. Everything else in that particular post concerning institutionalized religious dogma remains true in my personal beliefs.

						    urlLink WorkingForChange-This Modern World: Defending the Bush Doctrine   Happy Bastille Day. Let's celebrate by revolting against the bougeoisie of today: the radical, neo-conservative, profiteering, reactionary, racist, white-supremascist, biggoted, ignorant, dog kicking, inbred, zealotic, nationalist, republican, fascist, oppressive robber barons, retail-hogs, war mongering moneypigs, and p.c. thug-capitalists who only act in their own interests and to further their own agenda.  Wake up and shake things up today.         Your next calendar and greeting card company-sanctioned excuse to raise a revolutionary ruckus will be Guy Fawkes Day, on November 5. Any holiday that celebrates an attempt to blow up Parliament is fine by me.

						    urlLink Fundamentals of Buddhism: A Modern Perspective   There is no god. I am an atheist, but still consider myself a deeply spiritual person. But the concept of some high-holy authoritative patriarch only raises more questions than it answers. If there was a god, under what circumstances did it come into being? Does this god have a god? Does it question its own existence, just as we do? Inversely, are we the gods of some unfortunate subordinate beings? Theism only winds itself into a tangle of endless and circuitous philosophical quandaries; that is, if you take the time to question it.           Religion, whilst having good intentions, is just overgrowth that burdens and distracts the mind. It hides behind a benevolent facade while serving only as a self-indulgent opiate that is based purely on the selfish desire to improve unsatisfactory conditions. Mindless, sheep mentality religion is the kudzu of human consciousness. We must weed our minds and clear our consciousnesses.            As Zen Buddhism suggests, everything is illusory, empty, and non-existent. There is something beyond all of our human manifestations, but there is nothing elevated above our everyday experiences, be they mundane or extraordinary. Those false manifestations borne of our conditioned, fragile, and insecure minds (Life & Death, Suffering & Fulfillment, and all of the other dualities we create) are just the residue of our expectations that life is something it is not.           The common belief is that this life   is not  , and only serves as some obligatory requirement to enter heaven or the afterlife. This is life,   now  , not later. Wake up and savor what   is   and stop desiring and speculating what   is not  .             "As if you could kill time without harming eternity itself"- Thoreau           Time did not start with original sin and it will not cease upon your crossing over the threshold of the Pearly Gates. I don't know why we are here. I don't know what came before or after this life. Nobody knows these things. We know what is in the mind, and that is the extent of our knowledge.            Here is a statement based on a buddhist parable that I think applies perfectly to my opinion of life and religion: "The man wounded by an arrow wishes to know who shoots the arrow, from which direction it comes, whether the arrow head is made of bone or iron, whether the shaft is of this kind of wood or another before he will have the arrow removed. This man is likened to those who would like to know about the origin of the Universe, whether the world is eternal or not, finite or not before they will undertake to practise a religion. Just as the man in the parable will die before he has all the answers he wants regarding the origin and nature of the arrow, such people will die before they will ever have the answers to all their irrelevant questions"

						   Lately I've been incredibly lethargic and listless, and I'm getting fed up with it. My idyllic lifestyle this summer has given me a chance to swim in political literature and art. These pleas for change and revolution have reignited a spark within me. Not only do I want to do something to help the world, I feel that I need to in order to break free of my consumer automaton shell. I just have to find my role in the fight...  "First they came for the communists and I didn't speak up because I wasnt a communist. Then they came for the Jews and I didn't speak up because I wasnt a Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. Then they came for the catholics and I didn't speak up because I was a protestant. Then they came for  me  and by that time no one was left to speak up." -Pastor Martin Niemoeller

						   "Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed."                                                                                    -President Dwight D. Eisenhower " In the councils of government, we must guard against the aquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist."                                                                                    - President Dwight D.

						   I was rooting around my computer putting together a case against Bush for a friend who is teetering on the fence, and I found this.  {Feburary 10, 2003 [Shortly before the "Shock and Awe" campaign in Iraq began]              You do realize that this war is completely unprovoked and that there are dozens of other rouge states in the world that pose just as large a threat that aren't getting any attention from Bush only because Iraq has its mass quantities of oil to offer to the american economy and Bush can distract the American people with his flashy televised Killfest while he plunges the economy into the red and  undermines America's own natural resources hand in hand with the large corporations. So if u want to destabilize an already shaky nation and entire region of the world to spur even more terrorism and you want to imperialize the MidEast, go ahead because u won't take responsibility 10,20,30, or 200 years from now when u realize how big of a mistake this all was}  I thought it would feel better than this to be vindicated by my own words, but it isn't any consolation to be correct about the Orwellian fascist society we live in.
