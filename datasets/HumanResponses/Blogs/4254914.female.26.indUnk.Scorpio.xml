       urlLink    This "Fallen Angel" comes from a body of work (yes, pun intended) by an obscure photographer who would break into mexican morgues and use cadavers as models. Anyone know who in hell i'm talkin 'bout?  urlLink

      Hey grrl...I had to create a damn blog just to post this...but yeah.  One good way to remove the gum from da face...well I'm no aficionado...may only work with certain sticks....--->take removed gum chew and dab along the difficult face gum....normally starts collecting remaining face gum. Key is to rewet dabable gum by replacing in mouth for a few regenerating chews.  er...if not, leave it...make a statement without saying a word.  PS: Dubble Bubbles kicks ass.  PPS: Sorry to hear about the damn criminals in your neighborhood. Fucking society.

      The 2nd annual HOWL festival is on. Viva LES. I attended the Vomitorium last night by St. Mark's church with my favorite russian. He held me from behind while before me romans were entertained by fire dancers. Wild beats entranced and gothic church bars separated us subjects from the have's and the have-mores. Ah...the hedonism of gluttony. Naked and spoiled, these useless eaters and fuckers, basked in vain gloriousness. Benevolent whores and slaves surrounded well-off romans as they would puke their culinary excess' out to make room for more.  The by-products of imperialism never left  me  satisfied....  You say: May no roman be left behind! Hail Ceaser! Bow down to his minions! I say: Fuck ceaser. Fuck bush. Fuck my bush. My favorite russian already has...  I'm just a slave begging for crumbs while you consume, frontin shopping bags draped in the american flag. Red warning, red warning! Time to stop thinking, let the police state take care of everything while I tape my windows and salivate to faux news.  ((the pics below are some images from the event that I found online somewhere))

       urlLink    Byzantium, The Cambrai Madonna c. 1340, Metropolitan Museum of Art. About a hundred years after it was produced, Canon Fursy de Bruille acquired this icon in Rome. He was told that it was a holy relic; it had been painted by St. Luke himself. In 1440, the canon gave the painting to the Cathedral of Cambrai, France, where thousands of pilgrims saw it. The image shows Jesus squirming in his mother's arms. Mother and child, doleful and shy, turn slightly toward us, as if they are watching or waiting for something. The Cambrai Madonna conforms to a type, "the Virgin of Tenderness."  urlLink
