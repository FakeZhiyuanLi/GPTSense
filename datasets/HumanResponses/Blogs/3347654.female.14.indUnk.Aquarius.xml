      Well it's been a pretty cool week. School's out so that's pretty awesome. After school the last day I went to Mike's party, then stayed at Lana's house with a shit load of kids. It was pretty fun. Oh yeah like this week I hung out with Eric and Todd and people a couple of days, which was pretty cool too. Today was promotion... yay! I didn't even get my certificate so there was no point in going. Oh well. Anyways now I'm off to Justin and Nick's graduation party, well in like a few hours.

      Today i bought the "The Impossibles" c.d. called "Anthology" which is pretty good. i also went to brunch at the club and had to dress up and shit. Then Zach Richards saw me and i was mad because i don't usually dress like that. Oh well i dont' care that much.

      Yesterday I went to Gwen’s party which was pretty fun… then Jenna came home with me and we hung out then went to sleep. I finally got to see the T-Bird yearbook for this year. Hmm. Yeah later today I’m helping my aunt with her dance recital production so I’m going to have like the greatest time ever. By the way I am joking about that.

      um today was pretty boring. i was about to get a dress for graduation, but my fucked up mother and i got into a fight on the way there so she turned the car around. Oh boy was i mad!!! i screamed my head off at her!! then they dragged me to a movie (Godsend which scared me and i didn't like it) and dinner (3 Margaritas ?) yeah i barely spoke 2 words to them and my brother did too. So we talked instead. Anyway now i'm home and BORED so i dunno.

      Well I guess this is a continuance of my first journal. I switched servers but if this journal fails, I'll probably just go back to my old popularized journal.
