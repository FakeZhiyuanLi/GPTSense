						   Today is quite an unusual day for me. I had my lessons sqapped and I have to teach in the afternoon session. finally got an opportunity to sleep in...haha..Got woke up by Pastor Wallace when he called. Praise God that he came to Singapore and Eillen and I managed to break the news about us to him here,rather than wait till she goes back to waverly. Eileen went to the US embassy in the morning and finally got hte approval for the visa. She is comfirmed leaving for the States now. Time to get myself ready for her to leave. Still, I'm quite excited for this weekend to come. I'll be meeting Eileen's parents for dinner....stressed....I hope I'll do ok. Don't want to mess up the first meeting. Anyway, Better make sure I don't talk so much nor EAT too much..haha....oh well...time to get back to work...going fo rcell later...tolong for the rain to stop...

						   Really felt a challenge to seek for the wisdom of God...mediating upon these verses now...  "But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace&shy;loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere. "       James 3:17   Yesterday's cell meeting was great and really feeling that God is testing the quality of the cell via difficult situations as what was mentioned in 1 Peter 4.  I felt a need to lift up the cell and even the children's church in prayer..

						         It's interesting that I woke up today with a joy and a bounce in my legs. Somehow, having the talk with Lipyong yesterday really encouraged me. Plus, after I've seen the little boy who is fighting for his life in the hospital with the mother staying strong in faith and support, it's really hard to keep grudges in my heart. Somehow everything that has offended me just seems so small and minor. it really brought perspective back into me. Praise God for bringing such godly people and situationsto help bring me back to senses. Somehow, I really feel the joy bubbling in me again. It is something I always feel God has blessed me with, the fruit of joy.      School toady no longer seems to be so tiresome. Just had my observation by the senior teachers. Not sure of how I did, but I trust in the Lord and to know that what is important is that the kids actually do understand the topic. Praise God once again for everything.

						   Somehow, today felt really strange. I had a wonderful meeting with Dr Luis Bush, the man who coined and visioned the 10/40 window. He shared the story about a certain Korean youth who was inspirsed and led by the Spirit of God to find a new window, the 35/45 old turkish world window. he shared of how the youth travelled around with some of his friends in that window, praising God and having prayer meetings. The youth also got people in Korea involved to pray for the 35/45 window. It is really challenging to hear Dr Bush share the story. It sort of re-kindled my fire and vision of seeing children gathering together for a massive children's conference. My faith was strengthened and praise God for sending such a man of God to Cornerstone. Things felt strange partly because there seems to be a gap between Eileen and I now. I guess it takes time for me to adjust but I know that things will eventually work out for our good. Had a talk with Shuyi too during dinner. She spoke to me about my behaviour and attitude towards Wenhui. Basically she said I react in a not so positive manner towards her. To a certain extent, I think it is true. I did react to her constant counter-statements towards my comments. Sometimes i wonder why the leadership still keeps me in the zone discipleship group if every thing I shared seems to be wrong. During the last meeting, I really feel like giving up,going to auntie Daphne and ask her to take me out. Not because of Wenhui, but i feel that if there are things that are wrong in my sharing, it's better for me not to share at all in order to protect the flock. Personally, I feel as if everything meeting I have with Wenhui, she's going to have something negative to say about what I shared. To go into a meeting feeling like that is terrible and I tried so hard to be positive. Maybe the work in school has been catching up and maybe I should really consider stopping the driving of the van for morning prayer meeting because by the time I go for the meeting in the afternoon, I was really tired and zonked out. However, I managed to speak to Eileen about it and she sort of helped to make me feel better. I guess the only thing I can do now is to pray....

						    Yesterday was supposed to be ahappy occasion..that Eileen and I will meet up and have dinner with Ron and his wife. Turns out that the places we wanted to go were not open for business and we have to change the location twice. Had to settle for 85 market in the end. Still, things seem to be going really then until we left Rona and Sharon after the durian feast. I did some stuff that I really regreted and we hardly seem to be able to talk to each other after that. It been weighing on my mind the whole night and hardly had a good rest. I wonder how Eileen is today. I hope and pray that she is ok...

						        It's Monday again..when I'm feeling blue, all I want to do, is nothing on Monday...haha...simple song to cheer me up...      Oh well, I guess things can't be all that bad,except that Liverpool was held to a draw with Tottenham, didn't sleep well last night and just had my timetable swapped for Friday....hai...at least I get to meet Eileen tonight..haha...      Class was slow today...noisy too...almost feel my throat straining after going in for just 3 periods. Maybe I had too many breaks for the last 2 weeks, so not in the mode to teach. Even PE lesson was tough for me today with students complaining that they don't want to play at all. Irritating!!!!! How come I wasn't like that in the past and kids nowadays just don't like PE?I tried to so hard to have an opportunity to play in the past and now kids don't even appreciate it at all when given the chances.

						   Yawn.... Today is really a tiring day. Went to pick up Pastor David Wallace in the morning at 630 am. Attended both services, rushed home and change so that I can make it back to church in time to help in the children's church for the Ed Silvoso meeting. Once again, I missed out on a great meeting. Somehow I got used to it already. I'm pretty much down for the children when there is a meeting going on..but things look to be changing with the forming of the special task force who will help to look after the children during the special meetings. We went for dinner after the meeting with Boaz and family. But we saw the rest of the deacons at the chicken rice stall too..haha...had a big chicken feast... Had to send Boaz back after that. I drove all the way to Pasir Ris  then back to Eileen's palce because I asked her to be with me even though she hinted that she was tired. Felt really bad after that. Am I taking her for granted??? I just want to spend more time with her before she goes back. She shared that she had bad experiences before and was afraid to commit herself fully to this relationship, but God convicted her of it. Praise God that things are working out really well between us... yawn...

						   well, today is Meiling's birthday. She is Pastor Rupert's wife. I've known her since secondary school when she was my senior in the basketball team. She's realy good and fit then. Now, she's a mother of 2 and time really flies. Anyway, we went out for a fabulous dinner with them and Pastor Tim and sis Joanne. We had seafood! Black pepper crabs, crayfish, sambal fried fish, herbal chicken and stir-fried kailan. Boy, the meal was really great. I just found out too that I've put on 3kg since I got attached to Eileen. A sign of blissful times???hmmm... Anway, to cap things up, we had durians! It was a really good night-out with them. Really have fun. I wondered if I'll have so many friends to be with me when it's my birthday? A sign of being nice to everyone but close to none???

						   Sob Sob... finally, after 2 years of fun and studying in PESS, NIE, everything has come to an end today.I was quite happy to see my old classmates back in their graduation gown, all looking smart and ready. However there was a twing of sadness as I know this marks the end of another journey of my life...by far, this has been the happiest but most trying season of my life. Yet through it all,the many memories that I have is wonderful. Even as I think of it now, I feel the desire to want to stay longer. Now out in school, I no longer have the time to go swimming, play a game of netball or basketball with my classmates. Really missed the days of working out and losing weight...hai...

						    During last night's episode of the Singapore Idol, there was one contestant who is a single mother. She is only 21 years old but already, her son is 2.5 years old. What really saddens me to see is that she said she chose to be a single mum. Though I do not know the actual reason why she is a single mum, but I pray that the Lord will show her mercy and grace because she has to worry about her son's education and upbringing soon.    It was the first time in a long while that I stayed at home for the whole day. Almost 2 full month since I last did that. It was a pleasant surprise to my mum.It's a surprise to me too..haha...not that it was done on purpose, but I do enjoy staying at home and resting. The work in school is really mentally tiring and exhausting, but it is not physically tiring(judging from my belly).Praise God for the rest that I got. It was quite enjoyable.   Counting down to the last month before Eileen goes to the States,I'm really getting to miss her and can't wait to spend all my time with her before she leaves, but I realised that God has placed everyone in where they are for a reason. I can only pray that God will protect her and preserve our relationship because only through Him we got together, and only by Him can we stay together.   Going to buy a walkman later for Meiling...can't seem to find a good yet affordable one. The prices are quite crazy at where I've seen them. Almost $100...hai..Hopefully I can find one that is cheap and good later...

						   I watched the second episode of the Singapore Idol...it was hilarious!!! I really can't believe how thick-skinned some of the participants can be...however there were a few touching moments...like when the guy with speech defect came in to prove that "there's a will,there's a way", the girl who is hearing impaired...oh,not to miss, the girl who has nothing but only her voice,no looks,no nothing,but she made it through with just her voice...really encouraging..

						   Coming to the end of the long weekend... It was a good break for me,getting away from school and spending some time with Eileen and of course,with God. Managed to catch the fireworks live by going over to Pastor Rupert's place...It was really great to watch it together with Eileen. Once again, I really want to thank God for her. I went to the Nation-wide Pastors' Prayer Meeting on National Day morning. We delicate and declare that Singapore belongs to God. It was realy great!!! Really believing for revival to come to Singapore and that the Promise of God to Singapore will be stopped by the enemy. We went to different places of Singapore to pray over the areas. Well, came into church for the whole day today, hoping to paint the visitors' lounge but there was not enough paint to do up the whole room.hai...but went out with the staff to Ikea for lunch and do some shopping...oh..and I got back my ring after I changed the size. I praise God that I paid a good price for it and the service was really good...Amen! I'm getting ready for school again tomorrow..but I getting ready for my convocation this Friday. Another holiday for me...haha...Can't wait to see the kids again tomorrow...
