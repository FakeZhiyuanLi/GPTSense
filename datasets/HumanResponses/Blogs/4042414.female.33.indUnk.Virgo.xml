      I really have weird dreams. Last night I had 2 in a row that really were..... Let me type 'em out. First one: A military dude was in love with this chick and her dad was his superior officer, waaaaay up there (I really don't know much about the military, duh). Anyway, this officer don't like this guy having anything to do with his daughter, so he sends him out on this **** (no cussing, this is a family-type blog) assignment to some weird X-files green gooey experimental warehouse and totally tries to have this crud dissolve him. Well, it backfires and this dude accuses the officer of trying to have him killed. Lots of slime and goo and mucus makes me sick, so I wasn't feelin' too good when I woke up from this dream. The dude gets drugged and dumped in this silo of bodies and there's all this green ucky gross stuff, looks like snot. The dude escapes, again and for some reason the military are having a picnic right next to the silo and the dude goes to deck the officer meanwhile covered in this blechy snot-stuff. I'm like wanting to ralf, these 2 guys are beating the pulp out if each other, and I wake up. I gagged a bit. Twas' gross. Second dream: I was staying at this really nice beach house with my hubby and a few other people. Planning to go to sleep on the porch area, full moon. No one for miles, private, quiet. I cover up and settle down when this guy pops up out of nowhere and grabs my feet and starts drooling all over them saying, "I'm going to eat your feet. MMMMMM! Yummy looking toes." And then tries to lick them. I scream and start kicking like mad, meanwhile this creep-o keeps laughing and drooling and grabbing my feet and trying to lick them. My hubby comes running from in the house (watching the boob tube) and the foot guy disappears. I'm freaking out, telling him that there was some crazy creep trying to eat my feet and  he laughs at me . Never laugh at me when I'm serious and scared. I march in the house and upstairs. I lock the windows and check in the closet and under the bed. No one. So I climb into bed and who appears? Foot man. I scream and this pervert keeps doing the same thing and my husband  ignores me  and tells me I'm lying. Again I wake up, this time I have a raging headache. No more Little Ceasars pizza for me ever.

      I don't know, maybe it's just me, but have you ever noticed luxury cars don't seem to come with turn signals? Maybe they are an extra the people who buy these cars can't afford after spending all that money on their status symbol. You would think they would want them so others won't smash up their pretty little Lexus, Rolls, BMW, Corvette, etc... When they decide to dart lane to lane, or turn. When I honk my horn because they seemed to not notice, "YO I'm driving here too!" , I get their IQ.  One. Or maybe the real reason is it's their........ uh, compensation for being inadequate. THAT (wink, wink) inadequacy. Ah well.

      I dyed my hair. It looks purple. It's supposed to be black cherry. I like purple. I also missed a few spots, so there's a few blonde bits here and there. My hair, love or not, I do. Didn't feel like much today. Slept in late without wanting to.  Kinda' dull boring pppppttttt day. Like my life I guess. Yeah, right. If I was anymore colorful or loud I'd come with a warning. I just haven't found my outlet yet. I need a studio where I could create all day and all night. I'm just too cramped. I want to paint this picture that is jumping about in my gray matter yelling, paint me!!!! Then I can go on making jewelry and seasonal crafts AND FINDING A JOB!!! Being unemployed sucks. Being an unemployed artist sucks worse.

       Today I have actually thought about how blessed me and mine are. My family is close (even if we don't always get along), my grandfather (Dad's Dad)&nbsp;made it thru 2 brain operations this year for a brain aneurysm, my parents are still together, so are we kid's with our spouses, my brother's 5 children are healthy, we have a (cramped) roof over our heads, we have 3 squares a day, our basic and more needs are met, most of us are working. God is good. I may not have everything I want, but I have everything I need, as do the rest of us.     &nbsp;   I just got back from the post office (gotta' drive to get my mail. 9 miles) the whole way listening to Third Day's Offerings 2 CD. Awesome music, especially the opening song.      I wanna sing a song for you LORD       Lord for you I wanna sing a song      and I wanna lift my voice to heaven

      Ok, anyone with 'delicate sensibilities' please do not read any further on this post. I take no responsibility for any gross out from here on in.   As someone of the female&nbsp;persuasion &nbsp;I have noticed that in the ladies room when someone "cracks a fruity" there is a moment of silence observed right afterward. Is it for the loss of words to appreciate the bouquet, the music, the grandness of it all? Was it so astounding that the bathroom is being used for it's intention instead of a phone booth for cell phone users? Sometimes it just can't be helped that I have to giggle and say "good one" when a particularly musical note is achieved with gusto. Men don't care, at least the ones I know don't. They even compliment when a unique note is played.  I can't count how many times a cell user has been disgusted when someone actually is using the toilet. What is a bathroom for? How does the person on the other end feel when they find out your groaning out a loaf while on the phone with them?&nbsp;Sometimes I just want to take notes and then quiz these people about their personal lives right afterwards, like "Where is that rash you were just talking about? Has it cleared up?" Or "Well, if you won't do that position in bed, he can find someone who will. Here's a list of referrals ."&nbsp; And my favorite, "I heard you talking to yourself in there, here's the number of a good therapist."  Needless to say, I don't own a cell phone. I don't think there is really any need in my life to talk incessantly about diddlysquat like I hear other users. Only if there was an emergency like, oh say, my car's rolling down the freeway on fire, I've died and I'm late to my funeral, blown tire, french kissed a semi, that sort of thing. Now that I've rambled on, I think I'll go play Brazil in Slingo......

       Finally got to sleep about 3am. Mr. spider didn't come out to dance on me before I completely dropped off, so that was pleasent. Had a pretty odd dream about looking for my car and Superman, which is funny because he didn't look like anyone who ever played him, but he flew and wore the costume.    Kind of a dull morning. Don't feel too good, probably lack of sleep.     &nbsp;  Been getting email from scammers, you know the type: Hello sir or madam. I am the deposed ruler of Phullokrap and I have millions of dollars I want to deposit in your account. Puhleeeeeeeze. As if. Do they think I was born just today? twits.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      The past couple of weeks I've kind of slipped into a state where sleep isn't. The state of Insomnia. I don't have a regular schedule of life anymore since I lost my job (not by MY hands).&nbsp; Had some pretty weird dreams when I do sleep, like last night trying to escape a erupting volcano in a flying bus that gets hyjacked by a drunk woman driving with her feet.&nbsp; To make a long dream short, I don't escape, I take over the bus from the drunk chick and then get shot in the butt by the police because they think I did it. All in all weird. It is funny tho', my rear hurt terribly like I was shot until I woke up.  I've been browsing other blogs to see what everyone else writes and I've learned the world is very small. Everyone has a desire to be heard.&nbsp; And SpongeBobSquarePants has a church now.  Won't go there. I can hardly stand the tv show. That and Ed, Edd, and Eddy. EEEEP! I'd rather watch grass grow, sort socks, pick my nose, ANYTHING.  I do like the new insult I picked up from The Cramp Twins, GIRL PANTS!!!!&nbsp; I want a tee-shirt with that phrase.&nbsp; Girl pants.   GIRL PANTS   GIRL PANTS  GIRL PANTS.      I might just go wander thru some more blogs before I try to sleep.......

      OK. The "strange ranger". How this came about, my mother and I were having a conversation on the porch about something or other and it was finally cooling off outside. The kids were in the house playing with their mom, or watching tv when at the screen door the tyrant three year old kept saying "I'm a strange ranger, I'm a strange ranger." When Grandpa (my dad) came out of his room to see, the three year old was in his underpants, but not exactly correct. Both legs were down one leg hole, one cheek&nbsp;and other parts dangling about, and he's hopping about declaring he's a "strange ranger". Grandpa helped him get his underpants on right and it took a while to figure out he (tyrant) meant SPACE RANGER, but the "strange ranger" name has kind of stuck. I can't wait till they're all teenagers.

      Ever have those days where you just can't get a modicum of peace and quiet? Well in our household it extends to the bathroom also. 7 adults, 3 children (the youngest just potty trained) so someone   always   has to go. AND  lock the door  because the tyrannical three year old will  OPEN THE DOOR  and demand you fly off the toilet so  HE  can go, even if he really doesn't. Oh, and taking a looooong luxurious relaxing hot bath. Only if you do it really late at night or when by some happy chance you are almost alone in the house because, knock-knock, "I have to go to the bathroom". Even if you announce you are bathing and "please everyone go" by the time they are all done, the first one's gotta' go again.&nbsp; The joys of a close family.  Sometimes it is so easy to dwell on our inconveniences that we lose sight of our joys. I don't have any children so I get to help shape the future of my brother's.&nbsp; I love how the run up and hug me out of the blue "just because".&nbsp; They are a real joy, even the tyrant. I see so much of my childhood in them and it brings back happy memories, and some funny ones.&nbsp;

       I figured out how to add links. I'll add more in the next few weeks. Very much proud of myself.&nbsp; Something is seriously odd with my puter, my cursor disappears when I stop writing for a few seconds.&nbsp; Odd.....   Adventures of the "strange ranger" will appear soon, also the tyranical three year old, drama princess,&nbsp; and oldest brother.&nbsp; Fanny the cat may appear,&nbsp; also Lucard the wusspuss and Cougar the cranky cat.

      This is something new to me. Hello and welcome to where I rant, rave, bore, peruse, ponder, and generally write about whatever. Probably mostly family stuff, news, things that tick me off, silly questions to God. Today will be short as I have just started and really don't know where to begin. Plus I have to play around with the settings here to get everything just  so . Maybe more later today as the mood hits me.

      I have been labeled. Funny, because usually I don't fit into any one group. I'm a Christian Zionist. Look it up, I'm a 'dangerous' person because of my views. Too cool. I think I'll enjoy it. I never have been considered dangerous before. Wow, thought police. Whoo hoooo. Just because I take the Bible literally and Bible prophecy literally and believe Israel is the land of the Jews. Oh daddy, I am so JAZZED!

      In and out in 45 minutes and others were waiting for 1 1/2 hours or more. God got me in and out fast.  There were some interesting characters at the dmv. One girl was wearing a mini skirt so small that if she had any fabric between her cheeks and the plastic seat I'm the queen of England. I bet her ob/gyn has only a slightly better view. I saw biker chicks, punks, goths, you name it, it was there. But I was the only one in tye dye that I could see.

      In my weakened state I decided to watch something different. I love mysteries, sooooo Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot have been my companions for the past 24 hours. Very stimulating company mentally. I have to go to the dmv tomorrow. A couple of hours to observe people from all walks of life, all irritated at the long wait to see a real person and have their issues dealt with. Ahhh.... I shall enjoy tomorrow. If anyone cares to know which dmv, it's the one in El Cajon. I could be anyone in the crowd. Ha Ha. Let's see, the adventure begins tomorrow then!

      Well, one of them, song, and artist who sang it. Jeremy Camp I guess is a new up and coming Christian Contemporary singer, he sounds a bit like Third Day to me.   Hear My Voice      You are the only one that brings me peace   You are the only one where hope is seen   The mercy you've given is more than I deserve   So I lay it down so I can heed your word      Hear my voice, I raise to you   With honor ans praise   All glory is due   I lay it down all at your feet   With lifted hands it's you we seek      You are the only one that brings me truth   You are the only one that makes me new   The grace you've given a gift for all to see   So this is why I give you everything      And to you I lift my voice   And to you I lift my hands   And to you I give my heart

       I finally get to go out and have some fun and what happens? I get sick right afterward. Runny nose, cough, sore throat, WHY? Because sick people still go out and infect healthy people. Now I'm at home, red nosed like bozo the purple haired clown. I have to avoid everyone so no one gets sick. Help, she's got a cold. Run! Run! It's like having the plague, I swear. Pariah time and I'm it! No wonder we get epidemic cases of influenza, etc.... STAY HOME if you're sick. Nobody wants your germs. Wash your hands, use a hanky and for GOD'S sake cover your mouth when you cough and/or sneeze.                                                                     Nag Nag Nag Nag

      I went book hunting today, at a bookstore, not the net. You know, walking, fresh air, real people behind the register. Could NOT find a book to read. HUGE Barnes and Noble in Santee, almost NO vampire related titles what-so-ever. The ones I did find, read already. Necromancer series, read them, Anne Rice, read them, Mercedes Lackey, Poppy Z. Brite, and on and on. Anyone have any good suggestions, please send them my way.

      Damn, (sorry) I feel old. Old old old. 33 isn't old you say? The Heck it ain't. Life has gone on and marched on by. I'm 33 and don't know any of the new slang, lingo, etc ... used these days. Even chat abbreviations give me a problem once in a while. Most people I know are older than me. I dare not go into a club, I'd be the old fart at the bar. AND dancing! The style of clothing I like is OUT, well, for some. I like tye dye, leather, some lace that isn't too frilly, denim, velvet, and light cotton weave. I just feel totally out of place. I might stop blogging. Waste of cyber-space. OK, I hope this funk fades soon.

      OK, since I think not many are reading this anymore, which doesn't matter because this is for my mad ravings or sugary sweet thoughts and pppbbbttt if no one likes it.  My husband and I met in an unusual way. I was very much morbid, death, wearing black, pasty make-up, etc... But not 'accepted' by the Goth movement. Which depressed me even more. My parent weren't too happy about it, but I digress. It was 1991 and Dan Curtis had remade  Dark   Shadows  for TV, and of course, being vampire related, I was hooked, had to watch. Well we all know what happened in the beginning of 1991. President Bush Sr. took us to war with Iraq.  Dark Shadows  only played 12 episodes and was then cancelled, most of the episodes were preempted for war coverage, which was not a happy thing for selfish me. Well  Innovation  brought out a graphic novel based on the remade series and I snatched them up as soon as they hit the stands. In the back they had where people wrote letters and they published them with the addresses. I decided to write a certain man who sounded like he had really thought before putting pen to paper and mailing. So I wrote him, not expecting a reply. Or if a reply came, a note to buzz off. Such a positive person I was. Well, surprise, he wrote back. And wanted to continue to correspond in the future. We wrote letters so often, I got one almost every day. We exchanged phone numbers and ran up our phone bills something awful. It started out platonic, but we hadn't even seen each other, but everyone around us could see we were taken with each other. A year later, he paid for a round trip plane ticket so we could meet. Soon after that(2 months) we moved in together, then a year later, on October 31, we got married. I wish I could say it has all been bliss, but in a marriage, there are rough spots and smooth ones. Sometimes we feel like we should chuck it in, but I couldn't bear to, after all the emotion and hard work we put into our marriage. And I love him, with all the love in my heart can bear it hurts so much the ache. I would die for him.

      Sometimes I just h8 myself, and others, so glad to be me. Drastic mood swings in the ego department.  I tried to change my sleep pattern and just messed it up. Now I'll be up all night.  I heard this song on the radio that is plaguing my brain. I looked up the song on  urlLink www.klove.com  (I listen to this station here) and think I found it, but all I can remember is the chorus, and when I play the bite of song, it stops before the chorus so I'll just have to listen at the store when I goon monday. At least I have a list of artists to go by.  Sometimes I feel so old compared to others my age. Maybe it's because I don't do the same things, or I refuse to be lured into the trap I see my friends into. Drinking, bars, clubs,  not that they're bad  , but I could never find alcohol that fun,  I love music , but the style of dance isn't me. I would rather go to a nice restaurant and to the beach, or a drive in the country, check out little quaint stores, go wine tasting (haven't done that yet!), go to a play, concert, musical, take a quiet walk in a park, picnic, etc...   I must be boring to other people.

      My own space away from reality. Unless you've had hard times come upon you and your significant other and you both had to move back into your parents place, you have NO idea what a pain it is. With 8 others in the house and 3 of them children &amp; you've had a problem finding a job after the last one you had for 1/3 your life shuffled you out with out so much a severance pay, , arggggg!!!!!!! PLEASE, I want OUT!!!! I'm going nuts. I could just plotz!! No wonder I sleep most of the day and up most the night, it's quiet and I have space. My parents barely leave their room, it's so crowded. I hate hanging out in the house, hot, noisy, tv blaring. I don't watch much tv, most of it sucks anyway. I've watched all my movies over and over again. Tonite is the peak of the persids, but the mosquitos are back, so either bored in the house, or outside and get west nile maybe. I'll take west nile for a thousand Alex....

      Just not sleepy. Watching Forever Knight on DVD. I've forgotten most of the episodes. Just got my new  Fire Mountain Gems and Beads  catalog. Drool drool. I have so many ideas for new jewelry now, but have to wait till I have $$$ to put in an order. I love to create new things, in all sorts of media. I'd love to do glass beads, but don't have the room for the equipment, and of course $$$. But later on I will. I've browsed the pages, tomorrow I'll make my wish list. Maybe I'll post a photo or 2 of my work. I've learned peyote stitch and made 2 bracelets I love to wear. Also a patriotic pin and a strand that I might turn into a choker, or ? I also paint, do plastic canvas, wood, sew kids clothes, sew MY clothes, sculpt, rubberstamp, draw, color, SO why do I get bored so easily? I have to get out and window shop, steal ideas (well, remake them), and pick up the latest craft mags.

      California (Kah-lee-forn-eeaahh, lol) is expected to be hot, but the humidity is unusual. Eugh, and it makes for freezing over air conditioners.   My anonymous poster hasn't replied back, oh well. Anyone who reads my blog, feel free to leave comments, insults, lies, compliments, etc...  It fills an otherwise boring few hours, and I enjoy hearing from people, animals, aliens, losers, winners, etc...  I drank last night, something called Purple Passion by Everclear. Ugh, I had too much. It's great, but I forget that I have the most spectacular hangovers. My eyes feel like they've gotten 10 times too big for my sockets, my temples feel like they're giant veins ready to pop and spew blood everywhere, my thoughts are totally scrambled. I can remember the odd dreams I had, something about driving and everyone is going one way and I'm headed the opposite, even in my lane going the correct way.

      I'm beginning to not browse the blog list to see what has been updated and if there's anythinginteresting because   there's way too many porn listings!!      Shez, get a life people. Sex isn't everything, and some of the titles make me sick just seeing them. Some people just don't grow up past the Bevis and Butthead stage. And This is the most I've ever noticed, Sunday must be porn day for all the sexually frustrated.

      Oh, joy. We went to the movies. With the little horrors. But first, dinner. Which was uneventful, no messes. GOOD! Mexican food. One of my favorites. The movie however wasn't one I really was chomping at the bit to see, but the rest of the clan wanted to, so I went along. It was fun, the movie was....OK. Figure it came out just recently ( THUNDERBIRDS ) and being a Saturday night it would be busy. There were a total of 14 people in the theatre, at7:30pm when it started. 6 were adults. Dad got a bit ribbed by us girls, but we had fun. I was too young to remember the marionettes version. The fandango commercial made the kids laugh. The part where the paperbag lady in the taxi says watch out for the pot hole, the kids thought she said butt hole and I had to correct and explain, much to the giggles of the other 3 adults in the theatre.  Don't know if I will ever go to church again on Sundays. I enjoy the learning and the preaching and the teaching, but I get distracted by the ones who are there to look good. They 'appraise' you when you enter, like 'hmmm, is she worthy to come into MY church?' like they have sole rights to Jesus. It just kills the love I crave from my fellow family members in Christ. It also depresses the crap outta' me.

I love this song   Now's the time   Let the redeemed celebrate   If you know what I know   You can't wipe the smile off your face   Oh, people, stand up and praise      Chorus   There's a reason to dance   There's a reason to sing   Of the sacred romance   With our Savior and King   We lift up our hands   We fall on our knees   To the Son of Man   The reason we are free      All  glory to   The King of Kings, Lord of Lords   Oh, the value of your word   No worldly treasures can afford   We praise you for evermore      Chorus      There's a reason to stand   There's a reason to shout   To shout your name on high   So we take up our cross   There's a reason to die   Because Jesus is alive      Chorus          AWESOME      Just lift me up and makes me joyful. The  Blood of Jesus  is the most powerful thing ever. Cleanses us of our sins, make demons flee, protects us from harm, I love the movie the Passion because it shows me what Jesus went through to pay for our sins, the whole world. AND its there for the asking, just take it. FREE!!! The simplest thing to do. Being in the shelter of God is so calming and peaceful, this world can distract but never grant true peace. I  know  where I am going, so now death holds no fear for me.  I don't want to stay here on this planet forever. It is getting so corrupt and vile and horrid that I can hardly watch the news. Imagine condemned to be here forever. UGH. I've seen demons and I've seen an angel and seen the spiritual world effecting the physical and you know, I can't wait to see Jesus and throw myself at His feet.  I feel so unworthy to even touch His hem of his robe. I  mean, He took MY sins and paid for them and He didn't have to. God could have wiped out this world and started over,  BUT HE DIDN'T.  I mean, how many times have I startedover on some art that didn't turn out the way I wanted it and started over? He could have done the same way being the ultimate artist He is. Instead He love us even in our imperfection. How awesome is that????

      Slept in late today. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I've never been a morning person. I always liked working swing/second shift, the busiest time and you can see all sorts of people milling about. I always wondered if I should apply to work at the DMV, even though most people hate to have to go there, you see such a variety of people. I have to go next week and register my 2 cars, ugh. Too bad I can't take photos. Getting Mom up about 2:30am to watch the Persids. They peak around the 12th of the month, but she has to get up early in the mornings and it wouldn't be practical to send her to work after only sleeping a few hours.

      I am so glad I live in the country. You can see the stars, it's so nice. There are a lot of meteorites tonite, I guess its the persid meteor shower, or is it leonids now? I don't know, but I could sit for hours and just look at the stars. Every once in a while you can see a satellite slowly glide by, sunlight reflecting off it. Easy to let time just slip on by and not think of anything in particular.

      Sitting here doing stitching on plastic canvas and watching Forever Knight on DVD, I think back why I used to get a thrill from watching this tv show and why I enjoy it for a totally different reason now.     Before, while I was backslidden, wallowing in my anger at God for many things ( one was for taking my grandfather so soon, imo) it was a thrill to think I could exact revenge on those who made my life, growing up to the present, a type of hell. OK, maybe the sex appeal too of being a vampire. I read almost every book I could get my hands on, watched every movie, dressed in black, heck, I even made fake fangs that were for the most part pretty functional. It drove my family nuts, Mom especially. I met my husband during this time, but that's another story.      Now I watch Forever Knight and see a different side to the story line. I still pity Nick, he's still cute (my hubby's gonna rib me for that remark), the part where he's repaying society for his sins gets me. Society today could give a hoot. Everyone is into doing as they please, he'd fit right in. An 'alternative lifestyle', willing victims galore if you just look. I was thinking why doesn't he just ASK God for forgiveness? It says it right there in the Bible. Jesus says,  Luke 24:27  With my authority, take this message of repentance to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem: 'There is forgiveness of sins for all who turn to me'   and here   1 John 1:9   If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.      If Nick knew the word of God he'd know those verses, but in 1288 I don't think the Bible was read in anything but latin. At that time the crusades were ripping cross Europe for the greed of evil men in the Roman Catholic church. No wonder when someone Christian bashes, I have to point out that these men used the church as a means of power  and weren't following Christ's teachings. They are to blame, not God.      The fact Nick wants to repent and wants to change is the theme behind the series. Being a cop on the grave yard shift, sometimes he uses his vampire abilities (flying, hypnotism) for shortcuts to getting to the truth. Typical human response, why do it the hard way and be correct when the easy way is quicker and I get the same result, even if it isn't right?  It's a moral delema, and morality is subjective these days.  I like morality. I don't feel like I need to puke when I do what is right. When I follow the straight and narrow, it feels good. Even if it cuts across the grain of those who would say "Self righteous yadda yadda".  This is what I get from the show, he does what is right even if he slips a little, but he keeps on keeping on, pressing to do what is good, trying to shun the evil that tries to seduce him back. The whole flesh and spirit struggle that I deal with every day, Paul talks about it in Romans 7 & 8.

      Dad's ok. His truck, well, that's another picture. His axle is broken and transfer case is kaput. But he's ok, probably sore muscles in the morning, but no major owies, or minor ones either. Someone tried to jackrabbit around him getting on the freeway and smashed into his front drivers side wheel.          California freeways suck during coming home traffic. Thank God I live in the boonies away from the city. Cities are dirty, noisy, smelly, not to mention   RUUUUUDE .  I think it's the whole  too many people crammed into too small an area  thing. Where we used to live 17 years ago is like a druggie gangsta  area now. It used to be pretty ok. Couldn't catch me living there now.

      Someone sent a blank email to my dad with the title "You are a liar" and a fake email address. What a coward. If my dad was a liar, then confront him and present evidence. Since this person resorted to childish means, you can figure that they are truely the one lying, not my dad. My dad isn't a violent person and dislikes conflict. He taught me honesty and loyalty. The fake email is:  urlLink DJVC@juno.com . I know, I tried to email this person and it didn't accept it as a true email addy.

      Now I've seen some odd things for sale on e-bay, but these take the cake for now. Now you can buy:  GENUINE LOCH NESS WATER COLLECTED 14/7/2004   and   Royal Air from Buckingham Palace   Oh, puhhhhlease. Anyone have dehydrated water for sale? Just add water. I don't know how to make a hyper link, so don't know how to send anyone to these ebay goodies (snort).

      I like this quote because it reminds me to not let others control my life.    People like you are the reason people like me need medication.         I went thru depression last year and when I saw this quote, I cried because I WAS on meds. This year has turned out quite different than last year. So far a 5 month hiatus from work (not my doing, not going into that bitterness again). I knew I needed a vacation, but really!! 5 months worth!! Ugh. I miss work, I miss all my coworkers, it's my fault I don't keep in touch. I miss Tad and Corrine and Lisa and Ruby and Lester and Maria and Shari and Linda and  Leona and (the list goes on and aon), but I'm afraid if I call, all we'll do is rehash ( WORK  ) and then we all are rebummered about the whole lay off thing.       Pogo is having difficulties, I ought to quit playing for now. I won't win any money anyway.

      If I am tolerant except I won't tolerate intolerance, doesn't that make me intolerant? If I am pro-life/anti-abortion doesn't that make pro-abortion anti-life?

      Tiptoeing thru the recently posted blogs list, I find many are seriously lacking a profile. Don't care about pictures.  I must be just too open about me and I'm nosy about other people. In this day and age I guess no one wants to 'open up' themselves for criticism, but all want to be critical of others. Kinda' sad..... I like to dish it out with the rest, and here, I would feel safe to recieve it. But I guess others don't. One thing that I WON'T do is get into the politics thing here.  Un-uh, no-way, I already know how I am voting and for whom and nothing anyone says will change my mind. Even my Dear Hubby, who says, "what's the difference, they're all politicians". Going browsing again.....
