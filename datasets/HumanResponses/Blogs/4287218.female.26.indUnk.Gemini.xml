      And my life continues to stay full of weirdness. Last night I was pretty bored, I layed on the couch watching tv with my laptop on my lap. Then I got another email from CC. I am glad we are still friends. I missed him and Kenyon more than I realized. Kenyon can crawl already and say dada. I missed all that =(. In the end I fell asleep in bed around 3 am, while watching a movie. I kept waking up in the middle of the night feeling sick, running to the bathroom throwing up. I hardly slept again.  Today is the big day though, I hope the recording goes well for the radioshow. The intro's I got from Napalm are soooo tight! I am so happy with them. Chamelleon is making an intro for me also. He is the best. Tried to stay up to have it done for me, but he was too sleepy, did make me a shout out I can throw in the show. His song got the nr 9 spot on the top 10 request list on Royal Radio. This morning, he told me something, nobody ever told me before, not even a loved one. That meant a lot to me. He is such a good person, and I am so happy I got someone to share the same passion for music with. He always genuinely smiles with me whenever I am all excited about some music stuff. I defenitely have to shout him out tonight at the show.  I think I am done preparing everything for the show tonight so I might catch me a nap before its time to bounce. Dont forget to bring the PG cd's. Mah homies are doin da damn thang in NYC! So proud of them also.  Music was, is and will always remain my first love. It always makes me happy, keeps me happy, never disappoints me or lets me down. I love it. And thats an understatement. =)

      I just woke up. I actually slept for a change. I was watching a movie last night but I fell asleep, that hasnt happened to me in a while. Me and Devon had a huge fight just now on the phone. I hung up. Then a few later, he hit me back tellin me he sorry for hurting me and all. We had a real good talk about how this situation is. We kinda both figured out we probably dont match. I dont know, I guess its done. Blah.  The last thing I want is another insecurity about something. I already have enough insecurities to deal with, especially my health now. I have to go back to the hospital on Sept. 2nd. Do another biopsy to see if the lower tissue has cells that are effected too. Let's hope not. A few years ago I went through the same thing, alone. Now I still go through this, Alone. Nobody really cares, or maybe dont understand when I tell them. So I just dont tell them anymore. It just hurts more when you know that people know, but there is no support really. I am used to dealing with this alone so it doesnt really make a difference.  Funny how right now, after a good night sleep, my state of mind is pretty peaceful though. I have an important radioshow tomorrow so I am glad I am focused on what's important at the moment. I have to record the show and send it to Juize FM. They are interested in my (our, DJ Dynamite and myself) show. Let's hope they like the platform and decide to put the show on their station. That would be half a dream come true for me. Lord knows I worked hard enough for it......

      I don't know what happened anymore. Last night I was real frustrated, usually a good night's sleep helps, but sleep is something I rarely get to enjoy nowadays. I set up this blog stuff to write stuff off of me, normally I start writing songs, but it seems like I am "singing" the same old songs over and over, so I try a different approach to deal with these feelings. Who knows, this might be a new therapeutic way of healing or maybe I should say "improving" the quality of my life. *shrugs*  Last night before I went to sleep (tried to that is) I talked to Tarik, a good friend. Last time we saw eachother was last month in Brooklyn. Now he moved from DC to St Maarten and spent his birthday last sunday on the beach there. I was so jealous. I am glad he had fun though. I told him about all the good things and bad things in my life going on right now. Its such an emotional rollercoaster really. Its like I can't even enjoy the good things and simply be "happy" about it cause the bad things are downing it so bad. So much, I don't even know how to feel anymore these days.  I always been good at business stuff, but personal stuff......blah. I just bury myself in the work I got and hopefully I dont have to deal with a personal life this way. Work keeps me happy right now. Music too as always. I just hope my health doesnt get in the way of the things I love to do.
