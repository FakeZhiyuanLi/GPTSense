      well today sucked i'm just glad that there is only 9 more days of school left. Why can't people just leave people alone. It's not like the world is doing them any harm i mean why do we all have to be judged why can't we al just get to know people for who they are i would have alot more friends that way i feel bad all the time because nobody knows who i really am they never want to thake the time out to get to know me they just asume that im a poser or that i'm a prep ora goth and i'm not i'm me i don't want to be anything more than who i am the only person tha understands me is my David and i'm really thankful for that i care about him alot and people don't care about me beig christian like matt he doesn't care he pretends to and then turns around and cusses right in front of me and makes fun of me but it's ot that i really care but it's hard to be nice to him and my old friends gracie myra and elizabeth could care less aout anybody unless it's them they don't understand anything or anbody thats why they always talk aboutpeople in spanish because their afraid of people and know that all they are is cowards wo pick on people who didn't do anything to them but tell the truth i mean thats hw i was raised and i don't care what they think i mean all they are are scared little mexicans i hate life its full of crap and the only sure thing in besides god is death and you can't really trust anybody except those one or two people and you can't even really trust them well i g2g ttyl

      I should probably start by telling you about who i am. My name is Amber and i have a great boyfriend named david.i am 15 years old but my life is crap.So let me tell you about that 5-16-04 some fat mexican chick wrote my boyfriend a note saying that she loved him well i took it and threw it away before david could read it well now she is giving me problems and matt came to the satirs at school today and said that girl that wants to steal your boyfriend is up here so i yelled really loud "i ain't worried about it david thinks she's fat" i yelled it loud enough to where she could here it! But for a couple of weeks now i have been cutting myself or slitting my wrist and david hates it but it's addicting!David has got to be the hottest guy on the planet i g2g tell more later!
