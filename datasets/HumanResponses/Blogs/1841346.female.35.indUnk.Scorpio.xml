      A couple days ago, I finished a wonderful novel.  Masterfully written, intelligent and completely absorbing in its psychological and philosophical examination of overcoming the emotionally repressed life as seen through three seemingly different individuals.  The following quote is from the second to last paragraph of the novel.  Traveling the Midtown Tunnel, a  metaphore for the more indirect path we sometimes choose in life and how it inevitably leads us where we need to be (major theme), resonated with me as much for recent events as past ones.    The Midtown Tunnel is a funny place....Approach the city by any other route-the lofty bridges, even the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels-and you will emerge knowing precisely where you are.  But this route takes you in obliquely.  You come up not into the city's tarnished brilliance but onto a road beneath a shabby underpass, gray shadows broken only by weedy trees of heaven and billboards promoting airline shuttles.  You emerge onto a nondescript sidestreet-one that, every time, leaves you confused.  The needle on your compass spins, because you are no longer able to see the city's outlines or even to see that you are on an island, a glamorous place in many eyes, but to yours...a hard yet reassuring place to live. ~ urlLink  Three Junes , Julia Glass

      Last Tuesday, I get a phone call from my stepmother telling me that my grandfather has died.  I am sad, but not devastated as I didn't really get to spend much time with him.  Mostly, I worry about my grandmother and my father.  Christian informs me later that to fly to NY will cost upwards of $1000 then asks about driving there - it's six hours away according to  urlLink MapQuest .  Fine, I say as long as once we get to NY you drive.  It's a deal - we're off.  We switch after four hours so I can nap.  I wake up at 8:00pm (we left at 2:00pm) thinking we must almost be there.  How wrong I was.  The first thing I notice, other than the time, is Christian.  He staring straight ahead with the most intense look of concentration I have ever seen on his face.  Clutched in his hands laying flat against the steering wheel are the MapQuest directions.  I look around.  A road sign reads  Newark, New Jersey .  Noticing the miasma of lights ahead I think,  Wow. Newark is a really big city.   My cell phones rings.  It's Dad.  I tell him we are in Newark.  He says we are about an hour away and then tells me how the last time he drove to NY he missed an exit.  (This from the King of Driving - nothing scares him and he never makes a mistake.)  As we hang up, Christian says, "I missed it!  I missed the exit, I think."  I grab the directions and thus begins The Debacle.  We finally figure out how to turn around (going back through a toll, again) and do our best to make it into the city.  Thirty minutes, another missed turn off, two repeated tolls and annoyed toll booth operators later, we end up turning right at 34th and Dyer only to figure out in hindsight that it should have been a left.  We are lost.  In Newark.  Ok.  We can handle this, there are worse things.  Christian pulls over, gets out of the car and asks the first bystander, "Hi, can you help me?"  Meanwhile, I am in the car marveling at all the lights.  "Where are you trying to get to?", the woman asks.  He shows her the MapQuest directions and says, "New York City."  She looks at him rather sympathetically (she was a nice lady) and says, "This  is  New York City." Apparently, we were in  urlLink Times Square  and  we didn't know we were in New York City .  Yep, we were lost in America's most recognizable city on it's most recognizable stretch of concrete. Is that worse?  I don't know, but it is definitely much funnier.   P.S. Eventually, we found the  urlLink Queens-Midtown Tunnel  and with my cousin's help (who stayed on the phone with me for 30 minutes until we pulled in front of my Aunt's house in  urlLink Long Island ) we made it.  P.P.S.  Plan to visit NY?  I discovered these helpful sites:   urlLink New York Convention and Visitors Bureau ,  urlLink The Paperless Guide to New York City , and  urlLink Aaccessmaps .  (I plan to be better prepared for our next trip to NY.)

      Book: Have you read this yet?   urlLink Excellent book .  Set in 1660's Holland, is it about a sixteen year old girl who is forced to go to work as a maid for the Dutch painter Vermeer.  Not to give too much away, but she ends up becoming the inspiration for  urlLink one of his most famous portraits .  Sounds rather mundane, but actually it is well done.  Tracy Chevalier does a believable job of combining fiction and history. What impresses me is her ability to be so inspired by the painting that she creates an entire story around its subject.  What I wouldn't give to be that creative and talented.    Movie: First, let me say that I  love   urlLink Colin Firth .  He is absolutely one of my favorite Brits.   [ side note : He is also in  urlLink Love Actually . The movie is rather droll and the ending is cheesy, but there is something so wonderfully endearing about British humor.  I laughed myself silly.]  Not surprised this story  urlLink went hollywood .  Has all the delicious elements.  If nothing else, it should be a treat for the eyes as it is already nominated for three academy awards - Best Art Direction, Best Cimematography, and Best Costume Design. Can't wait.

      I am so excited to see this movie.  I have recently started reading Greek Mythology of which the Trojan War is one of my favorites.  (Brief synopsis in previous post.) For cool movie details check out the  urlLink official site .  For years, scholars and other dedicated individuals have attempted to sort fact from fiction.  Did Troy really exist?  Homer wrote of his accounting some 500 years later so how could it be true?  If so, where was it?   urlLink This  is a cool site to help sort fact from fiction.  Don't feel like reading?  Catch the  urlLink History Channel  program  The True Story of Troy .  It is fascinating.  More into myth?  Go to  urlLink A&E's web page  and look up times for their special,  Troy: The Passion of Helen .

       The Judgement of Paris:  The evil goddess of Discord, Eris, was the only deity not invited to an important marriage between King Peleus and Thetis.  So resentfully, she threw a golden apple inscribed with the words  For the Fairest  into the banquet hall.  It came down to three goddesses who appealed to Zeus to choose between them.  He refused telling them to go Mount Ida near the city of Troy and ask a young prince, Paris, who was there tending sheep for his father, King Priam.  Each goddess attempted to bribe Paris, but it was Aphrodite who promised him that the most beautiful woman in all the world, Helen of Troy, daughter of Zeus and Leda, would be his.   The Trojan War:  Helen was in an arranged marriage to Menelaus, brother of Agamemnon and now King of Sparta, who was chosen by King Tyndareus.  Aphrodite led Paris to Sparta where he was received graciously by the couple.  Trusting Paris, Menelaus left for Crete only to return to find Helen gone.  Paris had taken her to his homeland and Menelaus called on all of Greece's chieftains to help wage war on Troy.  One thousand ships were to set sail for Troy under the command of Agamemnon.  Before they could leave, Agamemnon had to sacrifice his daughter to appease the goddess Artemis in order to calm the north winds at Aulis and be able to sail.  The battle waged for nine years without a clear victor.  Many battles were fought but eventually the greatest heroes Hector and Achilles fought each other one last time.  Achilles defeated Hector but was soon struck down by Paris who was in turn killed by Achilles' son Neoptolemus.  It was at this point the Greeks devised a crafty plan to trick the Trojans and get inside the city.  They retreated leaving behind a great wooden horse that contained some of the remaining chieftains.  The Trojan's believing the war over dragged the wooden horse through the gates of their city.  Late that same night the chieftans stole out of the horse and opened the gates to admit the entire Greek Army.  By morning the Trojans were slaughtered and Troy was deafeated.

      This is what I think I have.  This is exactly my problem.  My circadian rhythms are so off.  I have battled this since early adolescence.  When a person's biological clock gets out of sync with accepted norms, sleep disorders arise.  In delayed sleep phase insomnia, the person falls asleep and awakens later than required for normal activities  such as work and school. Once the person falls asleep, however, his or her sleep is restful and uninterrupted.  Awakening at an acceptable time, even with an alarm clock, is extremely difficult.  Resulting symptoms include daytime sleepiness, particularly in the morning; fatigue; impaired memory and concentration; low productivity, particularly in the morning.   Relatively rare, fewer than 2 percent of those seeking help at sleep disorder clinics are diagnosed with it. It frequently begins during childhood and is most common during adolescence. These symptoms are also seen in people suffering from depression.  Therapies:  Chronotherapy  — This technique re-sets the person's biological clock by having the person stay up and awaken three hours later each day over a several-day period until their sleep and awake times are in sync with others. During that time they cannot nap, and once they've changed their schedule they must maintain it even on weekends (varying it by no more than an hour) to prevent the return of the problem. [this seems promising]  Light therapy  — This technique uses bright lights (as bright as sunlight) for two hours in the morning and avoids bright light for several hours before bedtime to shift the sleep-wake cycle.   Source:  urlLink Discovery Health::Sleep and Dreams:Sleep Disorders   I discovered this  urlLink article  and was rather astonished.  I have been taking antihistamines since I was a small child.  I quit taking them regularly a couple years ago.  The article concludes that, "Histamine appears to be necessary for the maintenance of the circadian rhythmicity of sleep-wakefulness cycles, food intake, motility and adrenocortical hormone release."

      I just googled when the sixth installment of Harry Potter would be coming out.  No luck, but I did find this article,   urlLink Next Harry Potter Title Unveiled  .  The book will be called "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."  I went to  urlLink J.K. Rowling's site  just to check it out and all she will say is that the half-blood prince is not Harry or Voldemort.  Hmmmm.

      It's called  urlLink All Consuming  - I love that title.  This site displays the most popular books bloggers are reading by the hour.  Check out the "Things For You" section in the grey box towards the bottom of the page.  What I like best is that it allows you to maintain a book list (see my sidebar).  And it is all free!  If you blog and enjoy reading this is a fun way to maintain a just purchased/currently/just completed/favorite etc. reading list.  And it looks rather spiffy on your blog.

      I am looking forward to this weekend.  We are driving to Buffalo to spend it with my aunt and uncle.  Fourth of July is always a special time of the year for us because it comes right after my husbands birthday (7/1 - happy birthday sweetheart).  I can't wait to hang out and eat BBQ sausage, hotdogs and homemade pizza.  Hopefully, it will be a nice weekend so I can take my son in the water.  Pittsburgh has turned out not to be the lonely exile we thought it would be with the Buffalo contingent only three hours away.  Truly, it has been our saving grace.

       urlLink     Posted by  urlLink Hello    My previous post about pulp fiction has prompted me to mention one of my favorite movies.  The Whole Wide World(1996) is a  urlLink true story  about the relationship between Novalyn Price, an independent and intelligent school teacher, and  urlLink Robert E. Howard , a ground-breaking writer of pulp fiction (created Conan the Barbarian) in the 1930's.  Set in West Texas, it is based on the novel Price wrote from her memoirs,  urlLink One Who Walked Alone .  Zellweger and D'Onofrio give amazing performances and the movie in total is done so well that I have been (reminded that I was) inspired to read the book.

      Hi.  My name is Leah and I read pulp fiction sometimes.  And when I say pulp, I do mean it in the perjorative sense.  Currently reading the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich.  It's trash, but it light and fun.  I only have two criteria for my pulp: (1)The protagonist must be a woman who is smart (or at least lucky). (2)She must be able to kick ass (including but not limited to the use of guns, knives, martial arts and/or magical powers).  Crime solving is always a plus.     It all began with pulp magazines.  urlLink Pulp magazines , often called simply 'pulps', were inexpensive text fiction magazines widely published in the 1930s - 1950s. Most of the few pulps still thriving today are science fiction or mystery magazines.  The name comes from the cheap woodpulp paper on which they were printed.  Pulps were the successor to the 'penny dreadfuls' and  urlLink 'dime novels'  of the nineteenth century.  Though many respected writers wrote for pulps, the magazines are perhaps best remembered for the  fast-paced, lurid, sensationalistic and exploitive stories  often featured in their pages.    Source:  urlLink www.wordiq.com   I suppose the more stolid readers in the family might want to do an intervention.  But I figure, hey, I also read books/mags about particle physics and cosmology so it all evens out.  [Besides, I have been sick for six days.  This pulp stuff is the best nighttime mind numbing, congested-stuffy head, sore throat, runny nose, cough, so I can get through the mountains of tissues and trips to the bathroom sink to hack mucus medicine.]

      According to Andrew M. Simons, professor of biology at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, "The presence of nipples in males is probably best explained as a genetic correlation that persists through lack of selection against them, rather than selection for them."  Male nipples in essence are "a genetic architectural by-product of nipples in females.  So, why do men have nipples? Because females do."

      People around the world in countries that haven't been peaceful for decades-if ever-are connecting to the internet, writing blogs and pouring their hearts out about the struggles of their people.  You know, difficulties like having enough food and shelter.  Not getting murdered for having their own set of beliefs.  It's a reality I don't have a clue about.  I have been so lucky by comparison.   Right now I am stressing about taking the pacifier away cold turkey from my son.  He has been crying now for 40 minutes.  As I sit here listening to him fuss in his crib, I am struck by the incongruity of my problems to those of, say, a mother in Iran who lost her husband and can't feed her four children.  And I feel absolutely stupid for stressing over a pacifier habit.  Which I actually did for 30 minutes.  It took 45 minutes for him to fall back asleep without his pacifier.  My little world feels alright again.  It is strange that during this global age of interconnectivity and mass information exchange I feel so disconnected.  So encapsulated in a safe reality that I have never had the courage to step outside of.  Now I have a son who will grow up to be a man and it makes me wonder what his reality will be.

      I have been on a mythology bent for awhile now.  Recently, I have become interested in the legends of King Arthur.  What is kind of spooky is that just when I decide to read about a legend a movie seems to be about to come out.  The movie about King Arthur seems really promising because they will attempt to tell the story of "the real hero."  When I saw that on the  urlLink official site  for the movie, I wondered what real hero?  So, I did some digging and as google would have it found two interesting men who have looked into it:    urlLink  Geoffrey Ashe  , an internationally known historian, is considered an authority on British history and mythology.  He has written twenty books and  urlLink his story  is very interesting.   urlLink  Graham Phillips  , former radio journalist and broadcaster for the BBC, has written a book called  urlLink King Arthur: The True Story .  He is now a researcher/writer and has worked with an archaeologist to uncover  urlLink his version  of the truth.  Their findings/interpretations seem very similar up until you get to which historical figure they think King Arthur actually was.  They also differ in where they think "Camelot" is located.  Much of the discrepancy seems centered around the interpretation of dates and pinpointing exactly when King Arthur lived.  The BBC Special  urlLink Arthur, King of the Britons  seems to follow Ashe's theories.  I hope to watch that. I may even read Phillips book, as well.  One thing I have taken away from this little endeavor is that it makes sense that a legend of this magnitude would have some basis in real events.  Ashe even speculates that King Arthur could be a compilation of several historical figures.  Even so, could you imagine for a minute being the kind of person that would inspire legendary stories for centuries?

      Book VI of The Dark Tower series (inspired by  urlLink this poem ) by  urlLink Stephen King , Song of Susannah is out!  Want a taste -  urlLink download excerpt .    It is  urlLink on sale  everywhere for 30% of the cover price.  The saleswoman at Waldenbooks says to me, "I just want to warn you that there is quite a cliffhanger in this one and the last book doesn't come out until November.  I am telling everyone so they're prepared."  (Did I ever tell you I worked for Waldenbooks once - absolutely the only job I ever had that I loved.) Little did she realize that I know exactly when the last one comes out.  I love people who read books.  They  get  it.  Oh well, at least I only have to wait four months.  I usually wait a year or more with my other authors.  Go SK!

      Yep.  Going to  urlLink Houston  in T minus 2 days.  I've been told it's  urlLink very hot .  I plan to get Hayden in a pool for the first time (which means, sadly, that I will have to get into a bathing suit).  The best part of all is that my brother lives there!!!!!!!  [I won't comment on the irony of him  finally  moving to Houston not two months after we are forced to leave.]  Nonetheless, it will be very groovy as his sweetie and her daughter get in the day before I do.  I can't wait to see their new house.  Hopefully, we will get to see Christian's family.  I know Hayden would love to see his cousins - who ask about him all the time and can't wait to see him.  I am a bit worried about the flight.  I hate flying (didn't used to, in fact, used to love it - not sure what happened).  Plus, I don't know how Hayden will tolerate having to sit on my lap for three hours.  All those times I got pissed at the parents of "the screaming kid" or "the crying baby" that sat close to me on a flight.  Oh well.  Turn about is fair play.  Little did I know, they didn't  want  their kid to fuss up a storm.  They were probably good parents with an intense (code word for "difficult") child.  Of course, now when I hear an unhappy wee one, I feel quite a large amount of empathy for the parents.  Ah, to be young again.  Remember being blissfully unaware of what you didn't know and wonderfully righteous about what you thought you did?  Well, it all comes full circle I suppose.

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.  Blah blah blah blah blah blah.   Just the other day in Ann Taylor Loft several sales girls crowded around him and ohhhed and ahhhed all over him.   Blah blah blah blah.  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.   The kid cracks me up - he is such a flirt.  His favorite thing is watching Winnie The Pooh.   Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.  Blah blah blah blah blah blah, blah blah   he hands me the remote and "tells" me to put on Winnie.    He is getting picky about food now,  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

He is so cute.  I just love that kid.  People stop me where ever I go and comment on how cute his hair is.  Or how gorgeous his eyes are.  Just the other day in Ann Taylor Loft several sales girls crowded around him and ohhhed and ahhhed all over him.  Which he totally loved.  Today several checkout ladies in Walmart fawned over him.  The kid cracks me up - he is such a flirt.  His favorite thing is watching Winnie The Pooh.  He doesn't like to watch  anything  else.  If we have the TV on, within minutes he hands me the remote and "tells" me to put on Winnie.  He is getting picky about food now, but he loves veggies so that's ok.  I am planning to teach him to swim this summer.  I'll send pictures.  Anyway, how are you?

      Just Finished: Angels and Demons by Dan Brown - The DaVinci Code was better but neither was all that fabulous.  Somewhat interesting if you don't know much about the history of religion.  Some of the ideas brought forth in TDC were rather against accepted dogma but nothing that hasn't been said somewhere before.  TDC has spawned several books that explain what is truth and was is not with titles like, The Truth Behind the DaVinci Code etc.  I say, get over yourselves.  It's  fiction  people - as evidenced by the stupid ending of Angels and Demons.  No other word for it.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.    Currently reading: Fortune's Rocks by Anita Shreve Great Expectations by Charles Dickens Mythology by Edith Hamilton  Up Next (in no particular order): Song of Susannah (Dark Tower VI) by Stephen King Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden Legends of Arthur by Richard Barber The Siege of Troy by Greg Tobin  What are you reading?

       Oh, Mr. Sun, Sun, Mr. Golden Sun, please shine down on me. Oh, Mr. Sun, Sun, Mr. Golden Sun, hiding behind a tree!    These little children are asking you to please come out so we can play with you!  Oh, Mr. Sun, Sun...   I have been watching way to much Barney.  Many parents have warned me in the past.  But I didn't listen.  Now my brain is slowly turning to mush.   Oh, Mr. Sun, Sun...   AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!   I have also seen way too much Winnie the Pooh.  However, he is not quite as insidious as Barney.  After all, Pooh is a bear of very little brain, so how bad can he be?  But Barney.  Too much is dangerous.  It's all the singing.  A new song every few minutes...   The more we get together, together, together the more we get together the happier we'll be.  'Cause your friends are my friends and  my friends are your friends.  The more we get together the happier we'll be!    urlLink     Thought I should practice before I hunt him down.

      I've sort of had an on-again off-again thing with  urlLink Alanis Morissette .  Her music is very distinctive but not always accessible.  What continues to draw me back in is her ability to communicate an acute self-awareness of both the good and the bad in herself.  Although, I don't think she is an amazing musical talent (although Jagged Little Pill was fantastic), I must say her gift is her ability to write captivatingly profound lyrics.  Often, I relate perfectly to what she writes.    I just purchased,  urlLink So-Called Chaos .  The salesman (overweight forty-something balding dork who wouldn't understand female angst given a brain transplant) tells me that, "This one is really a departure (yes, he said departure) from her other albums, it's much more upbeat." I just turned around slowly and stared at him until he said, "Is there anything else I can help you find?"  That's right.  Remember your place, man-dork.  When purchasing Alanis music it is important to have  attitude .  In this latest CD there are only a few songs I appreciate musically, but there are several that have amazing lyrics.  I found one in particular resonated with me immediately (which is something I can  always  count on)...    Out Is Through    Every time you raise your voice I see the greener grass Every time you run for cover I see this pasture Every time we're in a funk I picture a different choice Anytime we're in a rut, this distant grandeur  my tendency to want to do away feels natural my urgency to dream of softer places feels understandable but I know  The only way out is through The faster we're in the better The only way out is through ultimately The only way out is through  The only way we'll feel better The only way out is through ultimately  Every time that I'm confused I think there must be easier ways Every time our horns are locked I'm towel throwing Every time we're at a loss we've bolted from difficulty Anytime we're in stalemate, a final bowing  my tendency to want to hide away feels easier The immediacy of picturing another place, comforting to go but I know  The only way out is through The faster we're in the better The only way out is through ultimately The only way out is through The only way we'll feel better The only way out is through ultimately  We could just walk away and hide our heads in the sand We could just call it quits only to start all over again, with somebody else  Every time we're stuck in struggle I'm down for the count that day  Every time I dream of quick fix I'm assuaged  Now I know it's hard when it's through and I'm damned if I don't, no quick fix way What formerly was treatment silent's now outdated  My tendency to want to run feels unnatural now The urgency to want to give to you what I want most feels good and I know  The only way out is through The faster we're in the better The only way out is through ultimately The only way out is through The only way we'll feel better The only way out is through ultimately   urlLink So-Called Chaos  Lyrics

      This weekend I have the priviledge of attending the  urlLink Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra's  production of Carmen at  urlLink Artpark .  My Aunt sings in the Buffalo Philharmonic Chorus and was able to snag me a ticket.  I am so excited - I can't wait!  I had heard of the opera before but did not know exactly what it was about.  So I googled it.  Carmen was created by  urlLink Georges Bizet (1838-1875)  and founded on the  urlLink novel  by Prosper Mérimée.  The story begins in 19th Century Spain...   ACT I Soldiers and townspeople mill around in a square in Seville. A young peasant girl, Micaëla, asks the soldiers if they have seen her sweetheart, Don José. Telling her he’ll be back soon, they try to persuade her to stay with them, but she declines. The relief soldiers, including Don José, arrive. Factory bells ring, and a group of cigarette girls emerges from the factory where they work, including the popular gypsy beauty, Carmen. She focuses her attention on Don José, who pretends not to notice. Before leaving, she seductively tosses a flower at him. Alone, Don José recovers the flower and reflects on Carmen’s charms. Micaëla finds him and delivers both a letter and a chaste kiss from his mother, who asks her son to marry Micaëla. Don José promises his love and fidelity to Micaëla, despite the temptations of Carmen. A ruckus erupts from the cigarette factory. Carmen has injured another woman, and the officer Zuniga commands Don José to jail Carmen. But Don José succumbs to her charms. He agrees to a rendezvous and lets Carmen escape.  ACT II  At Lillas Pastia’s inn, Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Mercedes consort with Zuniga and other soldiers. A group of revelers arrives, celebrating Escamillo, the illustrious bullfighter. The crowd cheers as Escamillo boasts of his victories. He notices Carmen, but she remains indifferent. Zuniga, also smitten, tells Carmen that he plans to return to the inn later to visit her. When the crowd disperses, the smugglers Remendado and Dancaïro try to enlist the aid of Carmen, Frasquita, and Mercedes. Mercedes and Frasquita agree to help them smuggle contraband, but Carmen, expecting Don José, wants to stay at the inn. Don José arrives, and Carmen dances for him. But distant bugles signal him to return to his quarters and he prepares to leave. Carmen mocks his obedience and encourages him to run away with her and lead the free gypsy life. Don José remains unconvinced until Zuniga returns to the inn seeking Carmen. In a jealous rage, Don José defies his officer’s orders to leave. As the smugglers pounce on Zuniga and escort him out of the inn, Don José has no choice but to remain with the gypsies.  ACT III  At the mountain hideout of the smugglers, Don José longs for his mother, who still believes him an honest man. Carmen taunts him and urges him to leave, but he refuses. Frasquita and Mercedes tell their fortunes with a deck of cards. When Carmen takes her turn, the cards foretell death for her and Don José. The gypsies set off to smuggle contraband, leaving Don José behind to guard the camp. Micaela arrives at the mountain hideout searching for Don José and hides among the rocks. Escamillo approaches the camp looking for Carmen. He and Don José exchange words and begin to fight. But the smugglers return in time to stop Don José from wounding Escamillo, who invites them all to the bullfight in Seville. Her hiding place discovered, Micaëla begs Don José to return home to his mother, who is dying. Despite his violent jealousy, Don José leaves with Micaëla.  ACT IV At the bullfight, a crowd gathers to watch the procession of toreadors. Escamillo and Carmen arrive together. Mercedes and Frasquita warn Carmen that Don José is lurking about. Carmen, unafraid, waits alone for Don José. He approaches and begs her to leave with him. She insists that their affair is over, that she does not love him anymore, and that she now loves Escamillo. As Don José’s demands become more desperate, Carmen throws at him the ring he once gave her, with fatal results.  via  urlLink NYC Opera

       urlLink     London 1, The Saatchi Gallery   From  urlLink spencertunick.com    Spencer Tunick is coming to Buffalo.  I have to tell you that when I originally started this post, I wrote, "Would You Post Nude?" for the title.  That's what happens when you blog late at night.  I think I might.   Might .  Of course, thousands (maybe only hundreds) of other people will do it with me.  You get a free print and a memory that I am sure would last a lifetime.  Check out his  urlLink other photos .  They are fantastic.    Live close?  You can  urlLink sign up to pose .  At the very least, I would like to see his collection at the  urlLink Bodily Space: New Obsessions in Figurative Sculpture  exhibit.

      Michael Moore's bloggin' - read  urlLink his message .  Have you seen  urlLink his latest documentary ?  I guess the better question is do you really want to?  How much agitprop can you take (believe)?  I just read Mike's  urlLink Must Read  list.  Truth is I am almost scared to see this movie, but that's not stopping me from feeling this strange patriotic obligation.   agitprop \AJ-it-prop\, noun: Political propaganda, especially favoring communism and disseminated through literature, drama, art, or music: “It also is a conspiracy movie, agitprop against today's targets, big government and big business” (George F. Will).     Agitprop  comes from Russian, from  agitatsiya , "agitation" +  propaganda .   urlLink Source: Dictionary.com

      Found this site that seems dedicated not to a particular political ideology but to facts.  Imagine that.  Trying to cull the provable facts of what happened - not the spin usually fed us in the media. Their mission statement: We are a nonpartisan, nonprofit, "consumer advocate" for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in U.S. politics. We monitor the factual accuracy of what is said by major U.S. political players in the form of TV ads, debates, speeches, interviews, and news releases. Our goal is to apply the best practices of both journalism and scholarship, and to increase public knowledge and understanding.  The Annenberg Political Fact Check is a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania. The APPC was established by publisher and philanthropist Walter Annenberg in 1994 to create a community of scholars within the University of Pennsylvania that would address public policy issues at the local, state, and federal levels.  The APPC accepts NO funding from business corporations, labor unions, political parties, lobbying organizations or individuals. It is funded primarily by an endowment from the Annenberg Foundation.

      In an effort to stay a bit more current with world events I went looking for a way to manage all the news sources I want to read.  I have been trying out different free Web based aggregators.  They pull the stories/posts from whatever feeds you specify so you can view them all in one place.  The  urlLink Feedster  site is not always reliable (I found pages often loaded incorrectly and were not updated), however it does have a cool feature called  urlLink FeedFinder  which allows you to check if a specific site offers a feed.  I switched to  urlLink Bloglines  which is better organized and offers more services.  I plan to check out  urlLink more newsreaders  in the future.  So, check back for updates.   Wondering what the heck a feed is?  It's all about content syndication.  There are different formats but  urlLink RSS  is the most widely used at present.   urlLink Creating an RSS feed  is actually pretty easy.  I found a free software tool that will convert  urlLink RSS to JavaScript  which allows you to include feeds in your website.  Then there is  urlLink Feedroll  which is a free online service for syndicating RSS and ATOM news feeds on your website or blog (Bloglines offers this as well).

      As I sit on the plane still at the gate in LA, I watch my son warily and wonder how I can calm him down.  He is bouncing off the walls.  I think this is all well and good but soon he will start giggling.  He always gets giddy before he hits overtired.  Then wham!  You're in parent hell.  I reflect that I could get him in the  urlLink Guinness Book of World Records  on sheer decibel alone when he throws an I-am-overtired-do-something-mom-I-want-I-don't-know-what-I-want-definitely-not- that -I-can't-stop tantrum.   We finally taxi to the runway and the captain informs us that we will arrive in Pittsburgh in about 2 hrs and 16 minutes - 1:06am Pittsburgh time.  Bad news.  No car at the airport. We missed the last bus.  No one to pick us up.  We will have to take a taxi to the bus stop where Christian's truck is.  My son starts laughing.  It is unclear what has amused him.  I tell Christian a tantrum is eminent.  As we pick up speed for take off, I put Hayden in my lap.  Immediately he begins fighting, kicking and screaming.  I almost feel sorry for my husband as he has not experienced the special horror of a full-blown tantrum within a confined space packed with judgement and scorn.  Thus begins the game of Hayden Hot Potato.  He literally bounces back and forth between us and we alternately ssshhh and stroke him then give that up by attempting to cover his mouth.  Everything we do is in vain.  This goes on for thirty minutes.  During which time I am simultaneously worring how miserable my son is and when Mr. JerkMan will start something all the while receiving what I call Completely Useless Helpful Hints from several people including a stewardess.  I finally turn around include all in my gaze and say very loudly, "Thank you but that won't help.  He is overtired.  If I knew of something that would work, I would certainly use it."  Mercy desends many minutes later when he finally lets me rock and sing him to sleep.  The quiet is wonderful.  As I watch the moonlight play over the landscape I begin to notice that my tailbone has started to throb.  I am unable to sleep but I endure and we make it to Pittsburgh.  In the airport trucking to baggage claim.  The only bright spot in this whole ordeal is that Mr. JerkMan's foot is run over by someone else's stroller while we wait for the tram - take that you baby hater.  We get the luggage, hail a taxi and load up.  I start watching the meter.  We only have 35 dollars between us and we have no idea how much this will cost.  Fifteen minutes later we arrive at the bus stop.  We locate the truck, unload the luggage and pull Hayden out of the taxi.  And then Christian turns the key in the ignition and nothing happens.  He tries again.  It cranks but it won't turn over.  He keeps trying but the truck won't start.  It's now approaching 2:00am.  Resigned, we pile back in the taxi.  After ten more minutes and a nice conversation with our driver who is from Kenya we are at our front door.  It is finally over and we are home.

      The trip to Texas was wonderful.  But I was ready to go home.  Missed my bed.  Everything started out so well.  Made sure Hayden had his nap.  We even got the bulkhead seats - perfect for Hayden to play at our feet.  Not sure why it went so horribly wrong.  It all began about 40 minutes into the flight....   The captian comes over the loud speaker and announces that there is a small oil leak.  Not a big problem, there is plenty of fuel, but procedure requires maintenance take a look.  We will be diverting to Shreveport, LA were there is a maintenance airport waiting to receive us.  It is then I notice a wait-a-minute-did-you-say-diverting-is-everything-ok-with-the-plane-god-what-if-we-crashed-geez-why-am-I-thinking-about-9/11 air about the plane.  Ok, that was just running through my head.  Twenty minutes later as we begin our descent into LA, the captain announces that we will be circling Shreveport for about an hour to burn enough fuel to make the plane regulation landing weight.  Suddenly, I realize an argument is taking place behind me.  Then Christian turns arounds and yells something to the effect of, "So what!  He's a baby.  You were a baby once remember?!"  Huh?  I look around to find a jerk of a man complaining very loudly about my son.  He is sputtering something along the lines of 'that is the worst child I have ever seen, most babies aren't that loud' etc.  There is a man couple rows back who apparently was defending my son but I didn't hear what he said.  The stewardess shows up and tells my husband to ignore him.  That's what she said with some disgust I might add, "Just ignore him."  Hayden is not crying.  He  is  talking rather loudly however.  Christian and I have a tense few minutes of attempting to teach our son the meaning of "SSSHHH!"  To no avail, of course.  Then, BAM!  What-the-heck-is-that-is-everything-ok-with-the-plane-god-what-if-we-crashed-geez-why-am-I-thinking-about-9/11!  The Captain kindly tells us that he had to put the landing gear down to create extra drag which would aid in the consumption of fuel.  Nothing to worry about, it's just very loud.  And so began the monotony: straight, bank right, straight, bank right, straight, bank right...six times I counted before we were able to land.  We land smoothly and I think, "Terra firma!"  We are allowed out of the plane but are confined to the gate as the security is closed down.  As fervent rest room and cell phone activity begins, I resolve to ignore  those looks .  Yanno, the ones you get from people who think you are a bad parent.  Fortunately, one feels so much better after peeing and calling no less than four people to grip about one's current misfortunes.  The announcement.  The captain informs us that, "blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, sorry for the inconvenience."  I found out from another passenger that the oil leak in the wing was entirely a figment of the captain's imagination and is most likely condensation therefore it is time to board.  I turn to Christian and say, "I vote for another plane."  Because if we are going to be cautious - you know the adage: better safe than sorry - then let's commit completely to it.  As luck would have it, another plane wouldn't have made any difference because sorry it was to be.
