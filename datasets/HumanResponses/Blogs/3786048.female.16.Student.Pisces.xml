      Okay, so today wasn't the greatest, but i will get over it...i usually do. anyway the following is an exerpt from my journal/diary/scratchpad or whatever you wish to call it from yesterday...here goes!:"...I thought, "what if Bree and Jason get married?" I would introduce myself as sister to the groom[at the wedding], but what about his stepsisters from his Dad's remarriage? I guess I should be glad [mum and his dad] split up or I wouldn't be here. It's just hard to think that I barely know him and he has this whole other life that I know nothing about. I'm at least blood related, but what if whne mom dies he does the same thing Uncle Rob did? I hope not!" "...My mother was previously married to, wait, what's his name? I don't even remember. I think it's Craig. I don't know. I think he sent me my rollar skating troll on one of my Birthdays. I don't know why." I wont go into the other stuff about how amazing it is that I am here today and the workings of the female body for all you male readers. I'll protect your innocence for one day at least!  Have a fabulous day! Sweet Dreams! Ray-Ray

      What would a great movie be without great lines that you remember and repeat to your friends?  Mike Baker: She's got her period. Should be an interesting honeymoon, eh? Jim Baker: Where do you kids learn all this stuff? Mike Baker: School. Jim Baker: Good, I'm getting my money's worth.  Ginny: I love Rudy, and he is totally enamored of me. I mean, other men have loved me, but not for six whole months in a row.  Grandma Helen: Oh Sam, let me take a look at you. Fred, she's gotten her boobies! Grandpa Fred: I better get my magnifying glass! Ha Ha Ha. Grandma Helen: Oh, and they are so PERKY![reaches to cup them] cut to: Samantha: I can't believe my grandmother actually felt me up!  Long Duk Dong: What's a happenin' hot stuff?  Brenda Baker: Can you remember to turn off the stove in twenty minutes? Samantha: I can remember lots of things.  Geek: Do you know how many times a week I go without lunch because some bitch borrows my lunch money? Y'know, any halfway decent girl can rob me blind, because I'm too torqued up to say no.  Samantha: It's really human of you to listen to all my bullshit.  Geek: How's it going? Samantha: How's what going? Geek: You know - things, life, whatnot. Samantha: Life is not whatnot, and it's none of your business.  Geek: You know, I'm getting input here that I'm reading as relatively hostile. Samantha: Go to hell. Geek: VERY hostile!  Geek: So, what's your story? I mean, you got a guy, or...? Samantha: Yes, three big ones, and they lust wimp blood so quit bugging me or I'll sic them all over your weenie ass!  Samantha: This is Farmer Fred. Geek: Ted. Samantha: Oh, I'm sorry, Farmer Ted. Geek: I'm not really a farmer. I'm a freshman.  Jim Baker: That's why they call them crushes. If they were easy, they'd call them something else.  Jim Baker: Why do you think you're a dork? I don't think you're a dork. I don't think Mom thinks you're a dork. Samantha: Mike thinks I'm a dork. Jim Baker: Mike is a dork.  Samantha: I can't believe I gave my panties to a geek!  Geek: Not many girls in contemporary American society today would give their underwear to help a geek like me.  Long Duk Dong: No more yankie my wankie. The Donger need food.  Randy: Geek, can I be honest with you? Geek: Not if you're gonna insult me. Randy: [laughs] Ok. Geek: Shoot. Randy: Get the hell outta here!  Geek: Just answer me one question. Samantha: Yes, you're a total faggot. Geek: Ha ha ha. That's not the question.  Samantha: Donger's here for five hours, and he's got somebody. I live here my whole life, and I'm like a disease.  Ted: Would you guys please hurry up, I'm breaking like 20 major laws right now.  The Geek: Where am I? Caroline: I'll tell you where you are if you tell me who you are. The Geek: I'm Farmer Ted. Caroline: You're in the parking lot across from my church. The Geek: You own a church?

      Okay so VH1 has I love the 70's, 80's, and now 90's. So here is my own version of the 90's: *A lot of old people died, or is that just me? 3 of my supposed 4 grandparents, people who adopted me as their grandchild, and generally old people I knew. OLD PEOPLE BEWARE OF THIS CHILD!!!  *The only place you could find Care Bears was Goodwill and flea markets. Now there is an overwhelming population of these little bears. Kinda creapy. *Okay off the subject, but I realized that trying is crap. There is no point. Slacking off is the way to go. No one really cares. Everything is predetermined. Take dance team. The first two years I wanted in so bad I almost peed my pants! okay not seriously but you get the picture. And I don't make it...all that time and effort. This year I didn't give a crap and I make it. What's wrong with this picture? I only showed up for like 2 rehersals this year. Karma is one TWISTED SISTER! (kinda cool band too...they were from the 80's werent' they?) *Okay speaking of peeing my pants, as you all should know, I have left my shoes at home twice now. I swear if I do it again, I will laugh so hard, I will pee. That is my promise to you! Sorry pants! *Michael Jackson was big in the early 90's wasn't he?  *Elementary school sucked. Bad memories for the most part. Well maybe not. 5th grade was the worst. I was a crazy little kid. ADD probably if I weren't so gosh darn cute! The school wanted my brother on drugs and to see a shrink because of his bit of hyperactivity. We are supposed to be drug free, but they want us on drugs...go figure! Didn't some kid in high school sell ridalin (SP?!) from when the school started him on it in elementary? It just leads to bad things. More to come later...

      Today is my last Wednesday of Freedom! How sad is that? It's not even the middle of July yet and my summer is over...grr! I should not have done marching band. I should have skipped this year. There's a lot of things I should and shouldn't have done this year. I'm pretty disgruntled with myself for my lack of trusting myself. If I hadn't been so gosh darn set on pleasing people I wouldn't be so mad. Now I'm gonnna be mean and evil to everyone, which I hope is a change to most of you. Okay that's a lie, no more teenage drama blues. I'm sick of it. Anyway, last night I stayed up until 2 so I could watch Molly Ringwald in  Sixteen Candles  which is a fabulous movie. She's my new role model. Speaking of Role Model, I hope  Simple Plan's new cd will be out soon. That would be a great end to my misery. I'm such a teenage drama queen. No more of this drama crap, although it might be good for a future acting career...well, peaches to all, and to all a good night

      Dr. Livingston, I presume  Moody Blues    Dr. Livingston, I presume,  Stepping out of the jungle gloom,Into the midday sun.  What did you find there,  Did you stand a while and stare,  Did you meet anyone?    I've seen butterflies galore,  I've seen people big and small,  I've still not found what I'm looking for.  We're all looking for someone.    Captain Scott, you were so bold,  Now you're looking rather cold,  Out there in the snow.I've seen polar bears and seals,  I've seen giant antarctic eels,  I've still not found what I'm looking for.    Columbus, where are you bound,  So you think the world is round,  Sail off in the blue.  There are Indians by the score,  In many places that I saw,  I've still not found what I'm looking for.    We're all looking for someone.

       Okay today totally sucked. 1) I'm on the rag...not fun...a girl in colorguard(who shall remain nameless) started today....don't I wish I were little again...grrr...anyway moving on... 2) I got smacked in my shin with a flag...it hurt! 3) I'm not a dancer for this year's show. 4) I wish I were going to the Academy...the only reason I'm staying here is for a) a car, b) stupid I know...but a guy...who likes this skinny blond girl...do I need to go on? and c) to dance in marching band again....see a pattern? none of these are happening, so I should have just stayed on the waiting list and gone...I just wanted a car soo bad...but my interview is gonna suck...way to be a pessimistic Ray! I probably spelled that wrong too...this whole week sucks. I'm going to go watch Edward Scissorhands....and eat ice cream...That always makes everything better....:) o and forget about romance and what not...I was watching one of those Feed the Children commercials, and I was moved to tears(perhaps a fault of hormones) and I realized how privelidged I am and I should embrace my opportunities...although it doesn't feel like that now...please come cheer me up!!!
