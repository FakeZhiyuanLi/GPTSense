      I'm up in Albuquerque this Memorial Day weekend with Caroline.  We just decided we had to get out of Tucson. Caroline has training starting Tuesday at 7am, and I have class starting next Monday morning.  I'm taking vector calculus (yes, for the third time, but I want to try to improve my grade, I already have credit for it) and in the second summer session I'm taking Engineering Dynamics.  Both sound fun...  woo hoo.  Feel free to email, IM, say hi, or to read my other page.  You remember - it's at  urlLink http://abqwildcat.psychdude.com .  Have a great weekend and remember the reason we have it at all - to remember and honor the memory of all our country's soldiers, both here and gone.

      Ok, it's summertime and classes are out.  What the heck should I do now?  Today I was thinking about going and working out at Campus Rec up at campus.  I checked online to see if they were open and noticed that I'm pretty sure I wouldn't even be allowed in.  They only consider students "members" of the rec center if they're enrolled in classes at the time.  It's currently pre-session, I'm not taking classes (very few students are), but I just finished taking 15 credits, am registered for 3 in each of the 2 summer sessions and 17 credits for the Fall.  But I guess there's a good chance I'm not a student...  Since I can't go to the gym, I guess I'll have to use the gym out here at my apartments.  It's small, hot, crowded, and there's not a lot to do there.  The pool is filthy - ashtrays get flipped into it, bottles, cans, and cardboard float around in it, and it's got a layer of slimy stuff on top.  I can't give a great recommendation to move to  urlLink Sterling University Villa .  Check it out and compare it to the other college apartments in town.  It's probably comparable, but I haven't ever lived in any of them, so I can't compare it.  Sterling's not the best place, but probably not the worst in town, either.  When it's cleaned up and fewer morons are here (Summertime, for example) it's pretty nice.  But definitely check University House and Jefferson Star Ranch too - I hear they're pretty nice.  Off to find something to do...

      This is a blog that I am going to have available on my personal webspace at arizona in order to have backup in case psychdude has problems.  We're thinking of updating to MT3.0, and that could break things.  I don't know if I'll use this at all - it's a bit basic for my taste after tasting the power of MT. Anyway, go on over to  urlLink Abqwildcat.psychdude.com  and see what's up.

      Well, Caroline is off to training in Phoenix.  That makes me a bit sad and lonely.  :-(  ... But I'm still happy because I talk to her all the time.  She's having fun, and I'm having a chance to clean my messy room, but we both wish I lived in Phoenix or training was in Tucson.  On July 15 Caroline will find out where she's going to be stationed after her initial operating experience (IOE) is over.  It may end up being Nashville, TN since she put that as her third choice.  Every 28 days, everyone can put in for a different city to move to.  If she doesn't want to stay there (wants to live in Phoenix, for example), they might move her there.  Supposedly, it should only take her 3 months to get where she wants to go.  We'll see how much of that is true and how much is just stuff they tell new employees to keep them happy.  I hope it's all true - it would be good for everyone involved and would make it so much easier for Caroline.  One major problem is that we have to move her stuff to storage.  Her room is filled with boxes.  Some could probably live in my closet (which I'd have to move when I move to my new apartment in August), but most will have to be put in storage at a self-storage place in town.  There's one just down the street, but Caroline would need time off to come down and move her things.  I suppose I COULD do it all for her if she needed me to (I have a three-day weekend this weekend and next), but I don't know if that's something she wants me to do.  I took a nice picture this afternoon that I've added to my gallery.  Click it to see the full-sized version.  I think it looks very cool.  If you click the picture after you've gotten to the larger version, you get an even larger version.  urlLink

      Caroline's new job may take her a ways away from here.  She decided that she'd like to interview for the flight attendant jobs that Mesa Airlines was offering, and they called her back this week.  Training for the positions starts next week in Phoenix.  They have a hotel for her to stay in and she'd be in class for several weeks (6-8 if I remember correctly).  After the training is over, she would be stationed at any of several crew bases around the country since Mesa Airlines does contract work for US Airways and United, too.  If she has to, she could be moving to Washington DC, Fort Worth, Denver, Phoenix, etc.  I'm personally hoping she moves to Phoenix or Denver so that I will be closer to her.  Thank goodness we both have cell phones with unlimited evenings - it would be better to be on the same plan especially if she ends up a long ways away.  I'm only doing school for 2 more years and next summer I have no classes planned.  I want to get an internship (I'm planning on applying and getting moving on that this Fall), so hopefully we'd have some time that we could fly back and forth and see each other next Summer.  She gets free (or seriously discounted) flights on Mesa and whatever contract company she's working with, and I could get a "buddy pass" for discounted fares.  I'm really going to miss Caroline around here.  She's wonderful and a lot of fun to spend time with - even if we were just both studying or being bored.  At least we were doing it together.  I don't think the telephone is a good substitute for real togetherness.  I hope this works out well for her, though.  She needs income to pay for an apartment and student loans while she waits on nursing schools for next Fall.

      Yesterday was the first day in eight days that I didn't have a high fever.  Starting last Monday night, I got a high fever with the chills.  I took Tylenol and Advil all week and finally Sunday my temperature came down. I'm taking that Summer class, so I really didn't want to be sick and I'm glad that I got over it fast.  I missed class last Tuesday because of a Doctor's appointment and again on Thursday because I was just too fevered to go to class.  New thing I learned today:   urlLink Agrajag  was the bowl of petunias and surprised sperm whale who said "not again."

      Well, I'm taking vector calculus (Math 223) this summer session.  Yes, it's the third time I've taken the class.  I have to honestly say that this time it's really really easy.  I think that's due mostly to the professor.  Dr. Jialing Dai is the best professor I've had for this class ever.  She's very good at getting the material across, gives really fun lectures, and I think she really keeps the entire class interested.  It's great, and very refreshing compared to other professors at the University.  I hope I do well this time.

      How much were the insurance costs, do you think, to allow  urlLink Robbie Knievel  to jump over five vintage aircraft (most foreign) on the USS Intrepid museum ship in New York Harbor?  Seems like it would be one heck of an expensive thing to miss.  It's only a light bike,   but aircraft are fiberglass, aluminum, and glass.  I think it'd make quite a mess if he screws up.  It's on TNT live right now, and the artificial suspense is just as cheesy as it can get.  The announcers are announcing it like it's some X-Treme sports, prepare for death event.  Jump the Grand Canyon, and I understand that sort of announcing.  I'm not going to knock it too much since he is doing it (I believe) to raise money for 9/11 victims and their families along with the families of soldiers who have died in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Good causes.  Agree or disagree with wars, but the families of the soldiers deserve help.  Anyway, hope he makes it across... (I'm sure he didn't practice it or anything, after all...).

      Well, Caroline is going on her IOE tonight.  That's Initial Operational Experience, if you haven't been reading these carefully... Last night she came down to Tucson to drop off her car, and when she tried to start it after running an errand, she found that the heat and some sort of goop had caused the key tumbler in the igntion to seize up completely.  She got it fixed at the dealership last night, but had to stay in Tucson for the night.  We got her up to Phoenix today, and tonight she should be on her way to Santa Barbara, Las Vegas, and Santa Barbara.  I'm sure she'll have a good time and enjoy herself.  It sounds like a fun job, and she's definitely a people person.  She'll make a great flight attendat.

      Just a quick question:  Does Jiffy Lube really think they're fooling anyone when they insist (every time I take the car in, every 5000 miles) that I need an oil flush to "remove the burned oil residue from the inside of my engine and to get rid of the crap that doesn't come out when you do an oil change"?  Umm... what's the oil filter for, then?  And 3.5 Qts of new 10w40 should coat the walls just fine and I doubt there's anything that just stays on and won't come off.  Stupid people.  It's like it's corporate policy to lie to customers and try to get customers to buy an unnecessary service.  What do they flush it with?  More oil??  * as an update, and addressing the question of JL's honesty and customer service, check out the following page:  urlLink http://www.mohea.com/mike/words/000209.html .  Seems a lot of other people aren't that happy with JL pushing un-wanted, un-needed services either.  And it seems that they do screw up quite a bit.  Wish I could get to the oil pan under my car so that I could just do it myself and not risk it.

      After eating the same darn thing for 2 weeks straight, I'm finally sick of it.  As a result - I'm trying to remember all the old recipes that Caroline and I have used over time to make good food.   Mexican Pizza:  In a baking pan: Corn meal + Bisquick + a little water = crust dough Ground turkey + taco seasoning + cheese melted on top of dough Bake crust + meat and cheese Add shredded lettuce and tomato on top + salsa of your choice It's good stuff.  The only other dish that I'm ready to make is a  great  pasta dish.  Cheesy, Tomatoey Pasta:  Package of bowtie pasta cooked and drained Add jar of sundried tomato alfredo sauce Add cubed, cooked chicken and simmer to allow flavor to soak in Add as many sundried tomatoes (they come in a jar) as desired This is the best tasting pasta dish I think I've ever had.  I also bought a jar of Hoisin sauce (check your asian foods section).  There was this great dish called the Hoisin explosion at Pei Wei until May or so.  It was wonderful.  I'm going to find out if this is the sauce that they used in the dish.  If it is, I'm going to make myself my very own Pei Wei meal.  I just need to find a place I can buy pine nuts (it's the only way you can quite get the flavor right).  If you try any of these and like or hate them, or if you have any better ideas for dishes, you can leave me a comment.  Enjoy!

      Cortaro and I-10: just in on the news - they recorded wind speeds of 60mph.  Now that's a storm... and it's only about a few miles north of me.  I know a guy in one of my classes that lives up there - have to ask him about it.  The lightning may have hit something (or not) because we browned-out in my apartment.  All the lights dipped, computers switched off, and internet stopped working for a while.  Last night I saw lightning actually hit a power line (or something similar) down in Tucson farther and it sparked for a good 10 or 15 minutes.  *Oh, and an update - in the Northwest part of the city, the flashers aren't working for the railroad tracks because of a power outage.  So... you have to find another way to go around because apparently the barriers come down when power goes out... which is better than not knowing a train is coming because the flashers aren't working.

      Notice the difference in my face between the picture in my profile (on the right) and the picture a few posts back? Different angles, but my face was a lot fatter than it is now. That's what eating right and being active does for you, I guess. That and less beer. :-)  I took a great picture last night of the rainstorm that was out over the city and eventually came and poured on us up in the foothills. The sun is setting behind me so the rain and clouds are very red (I've tried to adjust the color balance to match what it actually looked like) and there's a partial rainbow too. Look at it here:   urlLink    Click on the image to see it larger, click again for a wallpaper sized version.

      Don't you just hate it when you walk out of an exam pretty confident, talk to classmates outside and begin to question your answers, then go home and find you made a mistake setting up the problem in the first place?  What a pain.  I hope I do well despite stupid mistakes.  I got my voter ID card in the mail yesterday.  As far as I know, Arizona requires you to re-register pretty frequently in order to vote.  It's not like they have the motor-voter law here, since your license is good for 40 years.  I registered outside of Pima Community College about a month ago with Caroline when we ran into a guy with a clipboard.  Glad I got the card - I was beginning to think I probably wasn't going to get the card and be registered by November.    It really won't be much of a national election this year - the senator up for reelection is John McCain and he's a man that I respect and who earns my vote every time.  I'm not a Republican, but you have to see past the party and vote for the man sometimes.  His competition isn't even seriously trying to defeat him - they've raised only 2000 dollars to his 2000000 dollars.  My opinion on Kyl doesn't matter since he's not up for election until the '06 mid-term election.  Grijalva has a good understanding of southern arizona and seems to have been a pretty positive influence on the area.  I haven't found a huge amount of information on him, but it makes me lean towards voting for him vs. for someone else.  The big, hotly contended election is the presidential election (duh).  I honestly haven't even made up my mind about who I'm going to vote for, yet.  I may lean towards voting for John Kerry, but I haven't decided just yet.  I do know that I was plenty turned on by watching Bill Clinton's speech at the Democratic National Convention last night.  It's mostly uninteresting to watch, but he gave a speech that made tuning in worthwhile.  You can hear it for yourself at  urlLink http://www.npr.org/display_pages/features/feature_3621016.html .  Take a listen if you want.

      Well, my class is nearing its end.  Today is the first day of the third week.  Classes are only 4 weeks long + a few days for final exam review and testing.  I have to say, Dynamics is not that hard.  It's just stuff we learned in high school physics, but applied to real, interesting problems.  Homework is driving me crazy, and I have an exam tomorrow that I'm not quite ready for yet.  It's 7:20pm and I'm thinking I need to eat, get some brain food in me, and then study until I hit the hay.  Hopefully it'll go as well as the last exam.  I'm completely out of touch with the news right now - I'm too busy to waste my time watching CNN repeat the same stories over and over again.  It's kind of annoying me, but I'm almost done with this small bit of stress.

      Ok,  I'm running  urlLink Knoppix  right now because my windows installation just went south for the second time in two weeks.  Well, just for fun I was playing around with nmap and looking at various servers on the internet.  Basically, it tells you the sort of operating system being run and how long it's been up.  Well, some servers consider it an intrusion or probe in advance of attack.  It's not - not any more than a car is a weapon - but they think it is.  Well, I went ahead and tried www.psychdude.com because I own that site.  It's hosted for me, and the hosting service has apparently blocked off my access to my own site.  I can't get to it no matter how hard I try.  I hope it's a soft block and it wears off sometime soon - I was planning on moving the posts from my arizona weblog to psychdude.  The URL is just shorter and it makes sense to have the posts at both.    I like blogger's simple interface and the fact that it interfaces nicely with audioblogger.  I just don't like that I don't own or operate the server it's being run on.    Mmm - I'm hungry.  Time to eat something and watch CSI on TNN/Spike.  Or maybe I'll have to watch something that doesn't take your appetite away...

      Wow, the interface on blogger sure is a lot different.  Very nice improvements, I must say.    Now my main point.  I started my new summer session class on Monday.  I'm taking AME250, Dynamics.  The class has ~90 seats, but there are only 12 of us in the class.  The professor is a nice guy who seems to be able to answer pretty much any question we put to him.  The one thing that irks me is that all of his calculations are dimensionless.  He never uses units in any calculation, but rather inserts the units at the end based upon what he thinks they should be.  He manages to do all the conversions between units just fine, but it's hard to understand what the heck he's doing sometimes.  My first exam is Tuesday, and I'm thinking I'll do pretty well.  The first part of the course just requires everyone to remember the equations of motion for rectilinear and curvilinear motion.  Of course, after that it gets into  urlLink curvilinear motion using normal-tangential coordinates .  Never seen this before, so it takes some work to learn.    This weekend I'm going to go up and visit Caroline in Phoenix again.  She's only got Sunday off, so I'm going to do my exam studying tomorrow and Saturday before I leave.  If I don't get it all done, I still have Sunday night (probably won't leave Phoenix too late in the day) and then Monday before the exam Tuesday.  Caroline found out that she's going to be sent to Nashville, TN after she finishes her initial operational experience training.  We're kind of bummed about that, but she's being an optimist like she always is.  It could be a lot of fun for her to live in a different place for a little while.  I think she still wants to be stationed in Phoenix, but Mesa says that most flight attendants get their desired station after about three months, and not to worry.  I hope that's true.

      Caroline came down from Phoenix this weekend to move her things into a storage unit.  For fun, last night we decided that we would go to the drive in theater with some Pei Wei take-out and see a movie.  I called up for what was playing, and we decided to see Anchorman with Will Ferrell.  Bad move.  The best part of the entire evening was the Pei Wei food and Caroline's company.  Anchorman was a reeking, steaming, pile of crap.  Within 5 minutes of the start of the movie, I knew there might be a problem.  At that point I realized there was NO PLOT, and I waited in pain for about 15 minutes for a plot to develop.  I'm sad to say that one did not.  Will and his gang of fellow anchormen and Christina Applegate just futzed around for an hour and a half doing virtually nothing.  Honestly, I think they may not have scripted the movie at all, and instead it was just some director that told the actors "go have fun with it.  be natural."  What a terrible idea.  Do not see this movie.  For a bit of comparison, it was about twice as bad as Cabin Boy - because at least Cabin Boy had a plot.  Chris' Review: 1/2 * out of * * * * *

      Well, summer session one is over.  I took my final exam for Vector Calculus yesterday morning.  I thought I did pretty well on it, and when the grades were emailed I found out I only got an 85% on the final.  That's still pretty good, though.  It was enough that I finally earned an A in the class.  I've taken it 3 times.  The first time, I was dumb and flunked it.  The second time, I was slightly less dumb and got a D.  Wasted a GRO on that one.  I waited 2 years, retook the class, and earned an A without hardly having to study ANYTHING.  Turns out I already knew most of the material, I just needed to take it one last time.  Caroline is on her way down from Phoenix in order to put some of her boxes in a self-storage unit this weekend.  Mesa Airlines is going to start IOE (initial operating experience) soon, and she won't have another chance to come back down before her lease on her apartment runs up.  That means everything needs to be moved out now.  Well, time to clean up a bit - I don't want her thinking I've been living in a messy room for two weeks.  I have been, but I don't want her to think so.  :-)

      Well, I just got back from Phoenix yesterday night.  I went up on Saturday because Caroline had Sunday off.  I stayed until Monday because I had the day off for the fourth of July.  It was a lot of fun and I really like Phoenix.  The first thing you notice is that there are normal people living there and they live in normal houses.  The people in Tucson are mostly a bit weird, and you can't drive anywhere without having to drive through really run-down areas.  We drove all around looking at various neighborhoods, and then later Sunday we went to Spiderman 2 at the theater near where Caroline is staying in Mesa.  Sunday night I got a much better hotel than Saturday night.  The Motel 6 is terrible and the air conditioning didn't work.  Imagine no A/C in Phoenix in July.  Yikes.  The Ramada Inn & Suites was much better.  The room was about the same price and actually had a kitchenette.   Very nice.  The other fun thing we did was to go to the Cheesecake Factory at the mall in Chandler.  Wow.  Glad we didn't get more than one piece to split.  I would have gone into a diabetic coma.  Now it's back to the grindstone for a while.  My class ends this week.  Thursday is the final exam and I don't quite know all the stuff I'm going to need for it, yet.  I still have to study.  For now, though, I'm going to the gym.  If you're looking for an interesting site, just go to  urlLink Wikipedia  and read a bit.  It's pretty good.  Or if you're slightly dorkier, try  urlLink Slashdot .  Time to go to the gym.  Woo hoo.
