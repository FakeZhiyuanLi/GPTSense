      In his pre-election analysis yesterday, Internet super-columnist  urlLink Mark Steyn  identified the four major Canadian parties with these flattering nicknames: "Crooks" (Liberals), "Fascists" (Conservatives), "Commies" (NDP), and "Traitors" (Bloc Quebecois).  As I sidled up to the ballot box to cast my vote a week ago - I had to vote in the advance poll because I am still technically a Winkler resident and last weekend was when I was back home - my opinion of the options before me wasn't much better.  I could only give thanks that I wasn't voting in the States, where they only have two real options.  At least I have three, or as in the case of the last election, four.  So who do you vote for when you feel the burden to vote, but you aren't enamoured with any of the options before you?  For me, it was a process of elimination.  My ballot had six names on it: the three main parties in my part of the country were represented, plus the Green Party, the Communist Party, and Christian Heritage.  I immediately eliminated the Communist Party.  I don't think this should require any explanation, so I won't offer one.  I then eliminated the Green Party and Christian Heritage because both parties are too narrow in their scope.  I can't vote for a niche party with one major issue that it hammers away at relentlessly at the expense of other issues.  I was left with the big three.  Paul Martin's Liberals were next to hit the chopping block.  To be honest, the major reason I found myself unable to vote Liberal was because of the gross mismanagement of billions of taxpayer dollars during the past few Liberal regimes.  The Liberals needed to be punished for that fiscal buffoonery, not rewarded with my vote.  As you can see, I was now in an interesting situation.  My two remaining choices were the Conservatives and the NDP, two very different parties from two very different ends of the political spectrum.  The Conservative candidate in my riding was Brian Pallister, a stand-up guy whom I've met and talked with several times, and a guy I like.  The NDP candidate was someone named Daren Van Den Bussche whom I've never met.  As I usually vote candidate over party, I was leaning toward the Conservatives.  But something inside of me would not let me live with that decision.  I heard a question asked in my head: "Which of these parties really cares about people?"  I couldn't honestly answer in the affirmative for the Conservatives.  I can't help feeling Stephen Harper and his party see the economic success of our neighbours to the south and will do anything to emulate that success, even if it means sacrificing important Canadian distinctives like universal health care.  I don't want a government that will steer us down the road the United States has taken.  It has led them to become the most powerful nation in the world, yes, but they are probably the most hated nation as well.  One might even say the Conservatives care about policies, not people.  I don't agree with all of the NDP's policies.  Their stances on abortion and same-sex marriage are particular trouble spots for me.  (That having been said, same-sex marriage isn't even the hugest of issues... it's not gonna kill anyone if two guys tie the knot.)  But when push came to shove, I felt far from comfortable voting for the Conservatives, and far more comfortable putting my 'X' beside Mr. Van Den Bussche's name.  After all, every vote counts.  Even mine.  Today's website is that belonging to the afforementioned  urlLink Mark Steyn , the Lay's Potato Chips of the Internet.  Bet you can't read just one.

      Went to see  urlLink Michael Moore 's  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  yesterday.  Wow.  As usual, critics are accusing Moore of making a film with an agenda rather than an objective study.  (Don't get me started on the over-valuing of objectivity... we'd be here for days.)  Regardless, the fact is, even once you peel away the Moore-isms within his presentation, Moore makes an unavoidable case:  The Bush family had business ties with the bin Laden family dating back prior to 9/11.  Three days after 9/11, members of the bin Laden family were flown out of the country without even being questioned by the FBI.  Investigative Work for Dummies surely has "Question the family of the accused as to the whereabouts of the accused" right on page 1.  Could anyone in their right mind doubt that this action is not related to the business relationship between the two families?  I had better stop myself before I go off on another political rant.  Suffice it to say, Fahrenheit 9/11 is an incredibly provocative film - that fact cannot be argued, no matter what your take on politics or Moore's techniques.  The inquisitive movie-goer will be able to cut through the trademark Moore presentation and find the root of the argument.  And it is a powerful argument indeed.  Today's website of the day is  urlLink E-Baum's World .  Full of funny and shocking media.  Not all content is guaranteed to be approved by Pastor James, though, so use discretion.

      Recently, I've become fascinated with the idea of joining  urlLink Mensa .  In case you haven't heard of it, Mensa is like an exclusive club where the only entrance criteria is high intelligence.  It's like Kinsmen for smart people.  The minimum IQ requirement for entrance is 130.  In every IQ test I've taken, I've scored higher than that.  These were online tests, mind you, and I'm not naive enough to assume these are all completely legit.  Being able to meet the criteria for Mensa is one thing, but what happens if I make it in?  Is it then safe to label me pompous?  Think about it: do you really want a friend in Mensa?  Heaven knows I'd never mention it in casual conversation.  Website of the day is  urlLink The Smoking Gun , for all the leaked official documents behind every major scandal you can think of.

      I'm still deciding whether to share this little site with the world.  "Why not," you might ask, "you went to the trouble of setting it up."  That's a good point.  And postulations like this are going out to no one in particular.  In fact, there's no guarantee that anyone is reading them at all.  And that's a good explanation for why these things are completely boring and unfunny.  Or maybe it's the other way around.  I stood in line for a good 20-25 minutes at the Department of Transportation to get my new driver's license and photo taken, etc.  It made me realize that I really don't like standing in line... for anything.  I was ever-so grateful to be behind some people discussing all the inefficiencies of the bureau-crazy.  Somebody said "that's NDP cutbacks for ya" and everyone nodded in agreement.  I wondered if everyone actually agreed, or in reality they understood the futility of a political debate in a DMV lineup.  Today's website is the  urlLink Internet Movie Database .  A very useful database on anything that's ever been on the screen.  I'm thinking I might advertise before the next posting.  Overexposed?  Me?  Who cares.

      "It's a trap!"  Admiral Ackbar's famous warning usually goes unheeded by web surfers as they dive headlong into oceans of time-consuming minutia and pop-up hell.  And now you're here.  I can't guarantee this will be any different, but I can at least guarantee my part of the equation will always be either be interesting or utterly mind-numbing.  And that guarantee is iron-clad.  Special thanks to  urlLink Peter Elkas  for unconsciously helping me find this little bit of internet heaven.  Buy Pete's album when it eventually comes out... sometime... in the future.

      Loyal readers of Pure Gold will remember about a column I wrote a year ago celebrating Winnipeg as  urlLink Canada's Murder Capital .&nbsp; I maintained Winnipeg should be proud of that title because, after all, we're rarely first in anything.  Well, now we've got nothing to celebrate.&nbsp; Stats Can's  urlLink new numbers are out , and Winnipeg has fallen all the way to sixth in murders per capita amongst Canadian cities.&nbsp; Abbotsford and Regina tied for first this year, with an astounding 5.1 murders per 100,000 residents.&nbsp; Overall, Manitoba lost its provincial title as well, surpassed by the hoodlums in Saskatchewan.  Let me just be the first one to say I will do my part in helping Winnipeg regain its rightful place among violent&nbsp;Canadian cities.&nbsp; This city's homeless population had better find a cache of flak jackets lying in the various dumpsters of the Exchange District, because starting Monday, I go nuts!  Today's website celebrates Manitoba's  urlLink Summerfest , where I will be spending a lot of time this weekend, screaming for more cowbell.

      I got a phonecall from the fine folks at Crystal City earlier this week.&nbsp; Right now, there is an immigrant family living in the house I will be moving into.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there have been problems finding them a place to live in August.&nbsp; This puts me in limbo.&nbsp; I may just be sitting here in Winnipeg for another couple of weeks before heading down there.   Nothing is easy these days.   Irregardless of my moving situation, I may find myself lacking internet access starting next week.&nbsp; Steve and I are canceling the service here.&nbsp; Plus, once I move down to Crystal City, I will find myself in a town without high speed service.&nbsp; Crystal City indeed.&nbsp; Somehow, this situation will be resolved.&nbsp; Life is just so much better with the intar-web.   Today's website of the day celebrates former Iraqi Information Minister  urlLink Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf .&nbsp; Click on the "Treasury of Deathless Quotes" link and laugh yourself stupid.

      A number of things to catch up on this time.  1) I spent last week back in the classroom, participating in an intensive summer course called  urlLink "Worship as&nbsp;the People's Work"  starring  urlLink John L. Bell  as guest professor.&nbsp; It was a great week of worship theory and practice.&nbsp; During the last day of the class, I sat next to 2-time Juno Award winner  urlLink Steve Bell .&nbsp; We chatted a bit, and I tried to act as non-fan-like as I could, despite the fact that I own almost his entire CD collection, as well as his concert DVD.  2) On Saturday, I returned to the deep south of Manitoba to partake in the wedding of one  urlLink Loretta Friesen &nbsp;to Tom Wiebe.&nbsp; Ask me in person for more details.  3) In an ongoing story, the Tragically Hip's In Between Evolution is growing on me, especially "Gus the Polar Bear from Central Park," "As Makeshift As We Are," and "Are We Family."  4) Is it going to be hot again this week?&nbsp; Good gracious, let's hope not.  Today's website belongs to Kenora's daily newspaper, the  urlLink Miner and News , featuring star sports editor Peter Jamps.

      I bought a new pair of shorts last week.&nbsp; I like them.&nbsp; They are good.&nbsp; In fact, I've already worn them out of the house a few days.&nbsp; Today I realized I hadn't taken the sticker off that tells you what size they are.&nbsp; That's just... classic.&nbsp; Soon people will have to remind me to put a shirt on when I leave the house. &nbsp; Thankfully, I wore a different pair of shorts yesterday.&nbsp; It was indeed my birthday (#24), and a number of people came over to share in the revelry.&nbsp; With the help of counsellor Andy, I discovered that, like him, I am a lesbian trapped in a man's body.&nbsp; It's quite convenient.&nbsp; (No, don't ask.) &nbsp; Now that I am an even 2-4, I have been told that it's time to start thinking about "things to do by 25."&nbsp; My main priority will be to find a colostomy bag on the street somewhere in downtown Winnipeg.&nbsp; That would just be too cool. &nbsp; Today's website belongs to quite possibly the best band Winnipeg has ever produced,  urlLink The Weakerthans .

      I went up to Rough Rock Lake for this past weekend, along with Pete and Jeff of  urlLink Pure Gold  fame, and Football Sean of no particular fame whatsoever.  It was a great time had by all, however we all left the lake with some degree of sunburn.  I would describe the burns on my arm and neck as third degree, while Jeff complained of a nasty burn on his forehead.  Just another reason to hate the Sun, despite all it does for us.  It's my birthday on Friday and everyone's invited down to my place to celebrate along with me and Steve (it's his birthday too).  We will provide a bunch of meat for a barbecue, you bring anything else you might enjoy.  Today's website suggestion is  urlLink Homestar Runner , complete with a brand new video for "Experimental Film" by They Might Be Giants, directed by The Cheat and Strong Sad.

      I picked up the  urlLink Tragically Hip 's latest album, In Between Evolution, this evening.  Upon my first listen, it was good but not mind-blowing.  I was hoping for mind-blowing.  But what can I say... that's after only one listen.  In other news, I found myself at home in Winkler yesterday and watching a documentary on the  urlLink History Channel  about the United States' involvement in the military coup of Guatemala in the 1950's.  I'm not much of a history buff, so it's no surprise I didn't know much about this event.  Or anything.  So, here's the deal: United Fruit, a U.S.-based company, owns a great deal of the land and means of production in Guatemala.  It's banana land.  Meantime, poverty is rampant as few people have the necessary resources to provide for themselves.  The president of Guatemala decides he wants to buy back a bunch of United Fruit's land and distribute it to 100,000 starving people so they can grow food for themselves.  United Fruit no likey.  And guess who are two major stock-holders in United Fruit?  Two brothers who are higher-ups in the Eisenhower administration.  I think it was the Secretary of State and the head of the CIA, but don't quote me.  Making a long story slightly less long, Eisenhower orders a covert coup of the  democratically-elected  president of Guatemala, all the while feeding the American public the staged story of a people's revolution, with the help of an apathetic media.  (Where was  urlLink Michael Moore  when Guatemala needed him most?)  I tell you this story because I just couldn't believe the audacity of President Eisenhower to pull off such a trick.  Also, it reminded me of the current American regime and its approach to foreign policy.  Good grief.  Today's website is  urlLink Real Ultimate Power , for some real ultimate ninja-style laughs.

      Got back from the big weekend at Lilac Resort today.  I hate to resort to cliches, but what is with this weather?  I mean... COME ON!  (Imagine me screaming that last line.)  All in all, I can't complain though.  Because I didn't have to pay for anything all weekend.  That's okay by me.  The weekend was generally cold and sometimes rainy, and when it wasn't, the mosquitoes were out in full force.  Thankfully, the  urlLink Watkins  company provides a mosquito repellent with the highest  urlLink Deet  content allowable by law, I think.  It's the  urlLink Jolt Cola  of mosquito repellents.  We also lit up a couple of Citronella candles and a fistful of  urlLink mosquito coils .  These measures did a passable job, and certainly enhanced our enjoyment of the Saturday evening fireworks, if you know what I'm sayin'.  The weather at least presented me with lots of opportunities to read, sleep, and think about people I've never met.  Carrying on with that reading theme, today's recommended website tells you a bit about the book I finished off over the weekend.  It's called  urlLink "Blue Like Jazz"  by Donald Miller, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Christian spirituality but not what Christianity often represents.  This book is a definite page-turner... down-to-earth and humorous yet thought-provoking.  I would recommend you pick up a copy, or you can borrow mine if you promise to give it back.

      Tomorrow is Canada Day.  Feeling patriotic?  Me neither.  That's what elections do to you: they suck all the fun out of any patriotism you might have had.  I'm not usually a very patriotic person... except for the maple leaf permanently tattooed to my skin.  I mean, I love my country and all, but die for it?  I don't think so.  Life is too great a gift to squander on such trivial things as one's country.  The family and I are spending the weekend, starting tomorrow, at the luxurious  urlLink Lilac Resort  near Ste. Anne, Manitoba.  I'm not really sure if it's luxurious... maybe I'm trying to convince myself it is.  Here's hoping I can get some relaxing done.  Stop laughing.  I know you're all thinking of Jerry Seinfeld speaking to George after he announces he's going on vacation.  "Whattya need a break from getting up at 11?"  Button it.  Today's website is one of the most addictive you will ever come across:  urlLink Yeti Sports , now featuring five (5) games for your time-wasting pleasure.

      A number of developments will see me losing Internet access shortly.  First, it looks finally like I will be making the big move to Crystal City next week.  This makes me glad.  However, Crystal City is a town without high speed Internet possibilities.  Second, roommate Steve is transferring his computer along with our Internet hardware over to his fiance's apartment.  So with that I enter the void.  I don't know how much Internet access I will have over the next weeks.  If at all, I imagine it would be of the dial-up variety, so no more downloads for me.  Whatever the case, my days as an Internet junkie are likely through.  Jennie from Alberta is coming out for a visit this weekend, which makes me extremely happy.  Ask for further details in person.  The website for today is  urlLink SportsGoons , a satirical look at the sporting world in the tradition of  urlLink The Onion .
