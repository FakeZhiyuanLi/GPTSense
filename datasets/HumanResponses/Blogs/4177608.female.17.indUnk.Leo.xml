      It seems that whenever a new edition of Grand Theft Auto or similarly popular game comes out, the mothers of America suddenly become terribly concerned for what the children of America are exposed to. Sex, drugs, violence, the desensitation of the American youth is inevitable. But to blame a simple video game for it is ridiculously unreasonable.  "My child saw an Italian man shoot a group of hookers with an automatic weapon in a video game and shot his best friend because of it." That, friends and neighbors, is bullshit. Your child shot his best friend because you husband is a drunken asshole who doesn't know how to properly care for and store a firearm and you're a self-involved yenta who's too busy fighting the war against Mortal Kombat to pay any mind to notive that Little Johnny is walking out the front door with a loaded handgun.  While we're on the subject, I'd like to digress for a moment and talk about South Park, a telelvision show that airas on Comedy Central and also has the same stigma about it. That fact of the matter is that the show is really a poorly animated but strikingly accurate social commentary. But it seems you have to have at least a double digit IQ to be able to transcend the fart jokes and iminent death of Kenny.  In short, I think I'm merely trying to point out that all this arguement over the effects of shooting games on children is merely a distraction from the real danger, mothers who are so busy saving their children from the evils of the world that their children are able to experience the "evils" of the world without restriction. How's that for irony?

      Bottled Water pisses me off. The fact taht we as people would spend money on something that you drink for free at any Wal-Mart or government building drives me absolutely ape-shit.  And the people who drink are so fuckin' arrogant about it. "I'm drinking BOTTLED water. It's clean and pure and I am going to live FOREVER because I drink nothing else." Fuck that! My goal here is not to live forever; it's to enjoy what time I signed up for and encourage others to do the same. Fuck you and fuck your bottled water too.  This is one of those things that has France written all over it.

      Yesterday I bought some Manga for the first time.  I used to be completely averse to this, as I never wanted to encourage the anime era. But there is one Japanese cartoon I'm particularly fond of, because the animation is more like Inspector Gadget than Pokemon. (Lupin the III in case you're wondering.)  Basically, what whappened was I walked into the Waldnebooks at the Vista Ridge Mall and was confronted by an enormous rack of Manga. Every kind of Manga I'd ever heard of an then some. And I almost walked right by until I saw the Lupin the III Manga. So I bought it.  And I never saw more nude women and violent stabbings in one piece of literature. If the plots had been more complex, it would've been high up on my list. But still, I think I got my money's worth.
