      In conversation this afternoon, I came up with an off-hand comment that later struck me as being Spot.On. I was asked if I had watched any of the democrat's convention this week, and I responded with "No" and went on to explain that I wasn't going to waste my time watching the candidates who will be nothing more than a footnote in the history of American politics by the early morning hours of 3 November. The Kerry / Edwards ticket will be just another obscure answer to some vapid question in some trivia game that will be on the store shelves for the christmas rush.  From what I've seen / heard / read about the donks' convention, it was just more of the same topped off with a generous dollop of ".....and we're not GWB.....". As I opined recently over at  urlLink Supply Side Politics , hatred of the incumbent is not a viable campaign plank and you can't run based on who you're not. Eventually you have to step up and define who you are and what you stand for and spell out your vision. Which is exactly what the kerry / edwards campaign cannot do if they want to avoid political suicide. Go ask Walter Mondale, who openly supported higher taxes (hey, give Walt some points for being intellectually honest despite the price). If the voting public ever seriously paid attention to who the donks consider rich and taxable, the  Liberitarians  would come in second in November.  Who are the "rich" who would be called upon to fund a kerry / edwards budget? The democrats define a family of four with a household adjusted gross income over $42,600 as being rich. That's for a family of four. Do the math, people.  More on this later, I've got some research to do

      My choices for entertainment this evening, after the&nbsp;family&nbsp;got bedded down,&nbsp;were numerous:     Watch the donks' convention  Break out the telescope and gaze at the Moon  Blog  Fix the kitchen chairs  Assemble the dresser for the baby's room  Re-organize the pantry  Fix the fridge's ice maker  Sit on the deck and drink copious quantities of rum   Number 1, watching the donks convention was right out, as I've heard it all before and I can't afford to break anything and the discharge of firearms is discouraged in this community.  Number 2 was out; while it's a rare clear night around here, it's also Garbage Night; so the hour I had for being outside got consumed with other endeavors.  Numbers 4, 5, 6, & 7 got shot down, as the rest of the family is sleeping and I shouldn't make any excessive noise.  Number 8 is not an option, as I can't in good conscience sit on my ass when there's so much yet to be done.  Fortunately; I found a happy alternative:&nbsp; blog and drink copious quantities of rum

       Lance Armstrong  has won his  sixth    consecutive   Tour de france.   Bravo, Lance.   The details of the victory are here in  urlLink this post , interpreted as only the NewYork Times could:       The difference in cycling between five and six victories is enormous, whereas six to seven is just another statistic and could be interpreted as a way of rubbing in his superiority.   Just another statistic, my ass.&nbsp; *****WARNING:&nbsp;Political Non-Correctness moment coming*****&nbsp; "But  all  the kids should get trophies"&nbsp; "Keeping score may negatively affect some of the children's self esteem".&nbsp; Bullshit.&nbsp; Rub it in, Lance.&nbsp; Go on and win seven, eight, nine.&nbsp; Win , Win, Win.&nbsp; Rub in your superiority.&nbsp; You've earned it.&nbsp; Do what you do best, and keep kicking their asses for as long as&nbsp; you are able.   Just another statistic, my ass.&nbsp; The NewYork&nbsp;Times can bite me.

      OK, so I'm late, you can collect your refund at the door.&nbsp; Likeks was again Spot.On. with his Friday bleat:    urlLink  Theyâ€™re like people who live in the same town where NASA has a tracking station, and think that it makes them all astronauts.   urlLink     He was talking about the 11 September commission and their report, along with some other stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go fix yourself a drink and read it, an giggle along.  He's not watching "Bikini Destinations" for the same reasons I don't go to strip clubs or Porche dealerships.....  &nbsp;

      I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't getting a chuckle out of  urlLink Lance Armstrong  mopping up the field in the Tour de france.&nbsp; Here's the premier event in france (name something bigger in france.....I didn't think so) and the entire cycling world is getting it's collective ass kicked by Lance Armstrong, American.&nbsp; For the sixth consecutive year.&nbsp; They should just go ahead and change the name to "Tour de Lance" and be done with it.   At the end of today's stage, our hero's lead is something like six and two / thirds minutes over the second place guy.&nbsp; The man in a fookin' machine; he smoked the field today, biking 34.18 miles in one hour, six minutes, and thirty-nine seconds. &nbsp;That's over 30 mph to you and me.   Wow.   I was on the (old and decrepit) mountain bike this evening, and rode about 10 miles in just over an hour and twenty minutes.&nbsp; I'm beat and my rump hasn't been this sore since the last time I rode the bike for over an hour, and I don't have to get up&nbsp;in the morning and ride over 100 miles to paris.&nbsp; Re-hydrating with a large jug of Ernest &amp; Julio Gallo's finest isn't going to help my cause.   Bravo, Lance.

      Jim at  urlLink Smoke on the Water  has a post worth reading  urlLink regarding the current state  &nbsp;of the democraps' party, and he again puts things in a proper historical perspective.&nbsp; Jim has a gift; who else could meld Andrew Johnson, FDR, Truman,&nbsp;Nixon, Woodward & Bernstien,&nbsp;Clinton, Sandy Berger, and Geo.W.Bush into a cohesive post?  Go read, and read the comments as well.&nbsp; His is a lively band, cussin' and discussin' the subject at hand

      Via  urlLink Lileks , I stumbled upon  urlLink this  post on the Flight 327 fiasco.&nbsp;&nbsp;NRO isn't in the habit of publishing crap, and&nbsp;the author makes some very salient points; I'm willing to let the particulars of the incident go quietly into the night.&nbsp; Go read, I'll wait.   However, the fact that these were merely Syrian musicians only came to the surface after half of the blogosphere went semi-ballistic on the issue.&nbsp; What about while the plane was aloft?&nbsp; Did the Air marshals know that the "band" was aboard?&nbsp; Wouldn't it have then be prudent to notify at least the flight crew and in turn the concerned passengers?&nbsp; What harm would have come from confronting the Syrians in the air once their collective behavior was causing concern?&nbsp; If they turned out to be just musicians traveling to a gig, no problem.     Air Marshall:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, you Arab-looking dudes!&nbsp; WTF are you doing?  Syrian Band:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's cool, we're in the band.  Air Marshall:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alright, then.&nbsp; Just sit down and stop acting so weird.&nbsp; You're making people nervous.   No blood, no foul.&nbsp; At the most, the Air Marshall service would have to issue an Official Apology to Syrian Band Members everywhere for their coarse and insensitive actions.   What if they actually were terrorist bent on destruction?      Air Marshall:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, you Arab-looking dudes!&nbsp; WTF are you doing?    1st Syrian Terrorist:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah Akbar!&nbsp; Die, you infidel pig-dogs    Air Marshall:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sfx:  Bang! Bang! &nbsp; ('cause anyone worth shootin' is worth shootin' twice)    2nd Syrian Terrorist:&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not with him, I'm a musician en route to a gig at a casino    Air Marshall:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sit down, Achmed.&nbsp; We'll talk to you later    Relieved Passengers:&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew something was fishy, I mean who eats their Happy Meal in the bathroom?

      Again,  urlLink Rachel Lucas  is spot on with her  urlLink commentary  on michael moore and the hollywood left's mis-interpretation of "freedom of speech" rights.&nbsp;   We're seeking congruence here, people.&nbsp; I can tell you to STFU all day long, and it is  not  censorship.&nbsp; The government doing so would be censorship.&nbsp; It's not that subtle of a point to grasp; there's not really any "nuance" here.&nbsp; Maybe that's the problem.&nbsp; Maybe it's too black and white for the hollywood left to understand.  I touched on this issue the other day over at  urlLink SupplySidePolitics , regarding&nbsp;Slim Fast's (righteous) firing of whoopsie goldberg as their spokeman-ette.&nbsp; If your employer fires you because you speak out against the company line or because your words and actions reflect unfavorably upon the company, that  is not  censorship in violation of your First Amendment rights.&nbsp; The "company" has just excersised their First Amendment right of "freedom of association"; meaning they no longer wish to associate with such an ass-hat as yourself.&nbsp; It's just that simple.  Raging_Dave at  urlLink Four Right Wing Wacko s has a most excellent  urlLink rant  on the subject.&nbsp; Go yea therefore and behold.

       urlLink Rachel Lucas  offers some excellent commentary on&nbsp;Flight 327.&nbsp; Go read&nbsp;all her posts in the "Gimme Valium" series right now.  This whole "Flight 327" thing should drive us all into some serious introspection:&nbsp; what would you have done if you were in Annie Jacobsen's seat?&nbsp; I'm semi-observant and obnoxious enough and my voice carries well; I'd like to think that I'd have been spouting out a very loud running Keith Jackson-esque play by play commentary regarding the goings-on in the cabin.&nbsp; What would I have done if I were travelling with my wife and children?&nbsp; Would I have been more vocal, or less?&nbsp; And why?&nbsp;   If there were Air Marshalls on the flight, what were they doing?&nbsp; The in-flight magazine is not that interesting.&nbsp; Picture all the sheeple, talking in hushed tones and passing notes, waiting for someone (else)&nbsp;to Do.Something.&nbsp; Are we still so deeply embedded in political correctness that the "Todd Beemer"-type personality is rare?&nbsp; Where is the man (or woman) who would stand up and say "Hey! WTF are you people doing?&nbsp; Sit down or we'll kick your ass"?&nbsp; To continue in&nbsp;the line of thinking that Rachel explores, prior to 11 September we had no frame of reference, no hard reasons to overcome our political correctness to question 14 Arab-looking men merely on the basis of their Arab-looking-ness.&nbsp; We have such a frame of reference now.&nbsp; I agree with her: the next time I get on a plane and see a congregation of Arab-looking men, I'm going to be singing like a canary, and not worry about who I piss off.  Go read Rachel's posts, follow the links&nbsp;and sit down and do some serious soul searching.  &nbsp;  I'm actually waiting for the left to bring Flight 327 up as an example of GWB's failure to do something about terrorism at home.&nbsp; It is an election year, after all.

      As a hurricane survivor myself ( urlLink Celia , 3 August 1970), I feel for our friends in Florida.  urlLink "Much Stronger Than Expected"  was very much like the headline for my hurricane. We lived in Portland, Texas at the time (Celia's eye passed directly over Portland) and our house was completely destroyed. I was just short of 8 years old at the time, but it left an indelible mark on me and who I am. To this day, I scoff at the weather: if there aren't four door 1969 Buicks getting tossed about by the wind, it just ain't a  storm .  I have a load of stories about the experience that I'll save for another time; now is the time for the Charlie survivors.  Here I sit, safe and dry and comfortable; with the lights (and the 'puter) still on and not having to worry about finding a safe place for my family to sleep or wondering where we'll get fresh water. And you are, too.  So if you can see your way clear to spare a few bucks; pony up at your local  urlLink RedCross  office. I'm sure that they have a "Hurricane Charlie" fund set up. No cash? Give some blood. It's all good, it all helps.  If you have the time and are available, load the truck up with bottled water and diapers and cans of tuna and batteries and some bottled water and first aid kinda thingies and maybe a bottle of rum or two and some bottled water and your hammer and work gloves and sturdy boots and a couple of sheets of plywood and some bottled water and some 2 x 4s and some more water and some duct tape and some heavy gauge plastic sheeting and some bottled water and a couple of bottles of rum and head on down and help. Be sure to coordinate with the RedCross (do your own Google search, dammit), they can direct you to the communities that need the most help. When you get there, find the neighborhoods that were impoverished  before  Charlie and help there first.  BTW: If you ever wanted to know what a "hero's welcome" felt like, stop at a Piggly Wiggly about 150 miles out and put a couple of dozen cases of popsicles / fudgesicles/ creamsicles on dry ice. Trust me, you hand a popsicle to an  adult  shortly after a hurricane and you'll be a hero. Just imagine how you'll look to the kids.

      Sigh     I've been falling below my self imposed standards for frequency in blogging lately.  Sorry.  Imagine that, letting Real Life get in the way of the on-line existance.   urlLink Lileks  is on vacation,  urlLink denBeste  is giving it a miss for the Dog Days.   urlLink Whittle  is kinda back, with another teaser about the forthcoming "Tribes" essay and the book.   urlLink Frank  is still working out the kinks; and  urlLink Misha  is just falling flat with me lately (".....it's not you, it's me.....").   urlLink Ann  is mailing it in once a week.  My Brothers-in-Blog on other endeavours seem to be missing as well.  My personal theory is that everyone is resting up until after Labor Day.  Once we're in the electorial home stretch, I believe the blogosphere will positively glow with a white hot brightness.  Lileks hit upon something a couple of days ago: SBHFS (Sudden Bush Hatred Fatigue Syndrome) where you just can't take it anymore and need a break from it all.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe we've reached our limit of all the baseless hatred spewed by the left and their willing accomplices.  Maybe we need tin-foil hats of our own, to insulate our brains from the barrage of crap that gets shovelled on a daily basis.  Maybe we should drink more.  I don't know.  There are a few giggles out there;  urlLink Ironbear  has a list of definitions that makes you think and chuckle.  And I recently discovered  urlLink VodkaPundit ; go read his "50 Things" lists for some ponderous laughs.

      Bravo to Bonnie Raitt for getting it right and understanding How.It.Works.  Am I going to go out and burn all my copies of her LPs / CDs / 8-tracks (8-tracks? WTF?) because of her views?  No.  I'm a "blues" guy and have appreciated Ms. Raitt's work for decades.  The blues is the blues, if you know what I mean. She's entitled to her opinion, because she understands:   "This is the first time I've felt moved to get behind something I that I feel is an emergency," said Raitt. "This is the most important election of our lifetime.   I am willing to lose fans ... I am a citizen as well an artist and I am willing to take the hit for something I believe in."   [Emphasis mine]  Contrast her statement ".....willing to take the hit for something I believe in....." to the whining put forth by the likes of whoopie goldberg / tim robbins / natalie maines / et al. Ms.Raitt has taken her position, regardless of the consequences. She knows how it works. Being ridiculously Constitutional, while I disagree with her position, I'll vigorously defend her right to espouse her views  If you're of strong stomach, go read the source article:   urlLink Stars explain motivation for political concert tour   .  I have a couple of beefs with the article's author, Roger Lelievre (sounds french, but what do I know?), the AnnArbor New's Arts Writer:  First, factual:      Presidential politics and music have had an uncomfortable relationship recently.  Just ask Linda Ronstadt and the Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines. Both vocalists made derogatory comments about President Bush during shows, with protests greeting their remarks .  No, Rog; Ronstadt got booted in LasVegas for dedicating "Desparato" to michael moore and protests greeted her comments.  Lumping her in with maines, who overtly made anti-GWB comments (whilst over-seas, thinking that no one in the USA would ever know, nudge, nudge, wink, wink) is intellectually dis-honest   and second, literary:     "This is the first time I've felt moved to get behind something I that I feel is an emergency," said Raitt. "This is the most important election of our lifetime. I am willing to lose fans ... I am a citizen as well an artist and I am willing to take the hit for something I believe in." Alienating fans is a definite possibility, Mills said, "but I believe the outcome of this election is far more important even than my career."  He quotes Ms.Raitt and Mr.Mills in the article before introducing them in context.  Bite me, I'm in William Safire mode tonight.  Other excerpts from the article and commentary:     The artists will tour under the name "Vote For Change," with money generated going to America Coming Together, a political action group affiliated with the liberal group MoveOn and aimed at defeating President George W. Bush. Other musical acts participating nationally include the Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, Dave Matthews Band, Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, James Taylor, John Mellencamp and Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds. Other artists a could be added, organizers said.    All members of "the usual suspects".  Nothing to see here, move on.     Mark McKinnon, the media director for the Bush campaign, said, "We think it's unfortunate these particular fine musicians have decided to affiliate with a hate-filled fringe group like MoveOn." But McKinnon said that Bush had drawn his own support from the entertainment world, citing stars like Lee Ann Womack, Kid Rock and Jessica Simpson.     What? Mark didn't give Charlston Heston and Bruce Willis their props?  Fargin' bastage.  And who the hell is jessica simpson?  Now animated characters have a voice in presidential politics?  Who does  urlLink Bug-eyed Earl  support?  Enquiring minds want to know, dammit.     Mills said artists are donating their services. All funds raised beyond expenses will go to America Coming Together.    "All funds beyond expenses" indeed.  Have you seen the cost of cocaine lately?  "America Coming Together" is going to get stuck with one hell of a bar tab.     There have been a number of highly publicized efforts to encourage election participation, particularly by young people, among them Rock the Vote. Mills said he thinks the combined effort of everyone involved will get attention and make an impression.     Hell, it got billyjeff elected.....      "It's not so much myself, or R.E.M., or any one artist that's involved in this. It's the fact that there are so many, coming from such diverse places on the musical spectrum, all coming together for this single purpose," he said.   Bravo to this Mr.Mills, whoever he may be.  Go read the article, he comports himself as understanding how it works.   And I'm all for encourging election participation.  Ab-so-fookin-lutely.  Just don't stand on queue next to me in the voting line with your UAW "Vote for the following people" card in hand, unless you want an ear-full.     Raitt added that thought the purpose of the concerts is political, the focus will be on this music. "We don't see hours of haranguing speeches and 20 minutes of music," she said.   I rather doubt it.  More people lit up American flags and pictures of GWB at this year's "AnnArbor Hash Bash" than they did joints.   Reach Roger LeLievre at rlelievre@annarbornews.com.  (Hell, it's in his by-line.....doesn't that make it public info?)

      It's not that I want to stay up to all hours and piddle away at this blogging thing. It just happens that way. By the time we go through the evening rituals here at Casa de Heywood, and the rest of the family is bedded down, and I complete my "chores", it's often 11:00 or 11:30 PM before I get to the 'puter. Then it's a quick run through the "dailies":  urlLink Whittle ,  urlLink Misha ,  urlLink Frank ,  urlLink Rachel ,  urlLink Jim ,  urlLink Scott ,  urlLink Kim ,  urlLink James , and  urlLink John , and  urlLink Ann , and  urlLink Mark ; each with their own outbound links. doG forbid that  urlLink Steve  has something of interest. Jebeezus, that sucks up 40 minutes or a hour right there, on a night that I don't go surfing through the multitudes that I have bookmarked as "Non-Dailies". And I read fast.  I need to hit the lottery, so I can blog at decent hours.

       Update===> The venue for the concert has been moved to Detroit's Cobo Arena. How a venue designed as a hockey stadium differs from one designed as a basketball stadium with regard to the aforementioned "production issues" is anyone's guess. I'm just sayin', that's all. Read it here:  urlLink 'Vote for Change' Springsteen show moves to Cobo .   Original post:   Good. I needed a chuckle today.

      OK, so BigMedia will never let  urlLink this  out over the airwaves, and if it makes it to your local paper it will be buried in the lower left hand corner of page 4 between the column about excessive overtime at the city waste treatment plant and the ad for all-natural male enhancement but every American out there busting their hump to provide for their family should read what Hitlery Clinton had to say in SanFransisco.  Even though it was reported to be a $10K per plate big shot dinner, don't let that fool you: she's after  your  money.  The democraps view any family of four with a household income over $42,600 per year as "rich".  I haven't see john "I've been to VietNam" kerry's tax plan yet (and I am working diligently to  never  have to worry about his tax plan) but the "dims" keep talking about marginal rates of over 50%.   Bravo Sierra.  I work too fookin' hard for my scratch  (and you do too)  and I'm not going to pony up any more of my hard earned cash for Hitlery's Village   urlLink Emperor Misha  (thank you, my Liege, for the SFGate link, BTW) hits it on the head.  And thank you very much to my brother-in-blog for pointing out this little gem

Whoever stole algore's medication, please return it as soon as possible.  Otherwise, one of you is going to have to drive to canada to get more.  Please, don't let all those years of therapy go to waste.

      This is familiar,  urlLink   I just had to link to this story since Al Bore has demonized internet bloggers as anti-democracy right wing bigots trying to stifle differences of opinion and debate. This seems to me, to be very typical of the left. What-ever they do, they accuse the right of doing because they find it hard to believe that everyone isn't as un-principled as they are. This scene is repeated often at Kerry gathering, especially to pro-life or pro-defense of marriage activists in attendance. Sad......but they must be educated.  Greg

      Greetings! This is a 2 person blog site dedicated to supporting the VRWC and all of it's affiliates. Blogging will be light as my partner and I have full time jobs. However, we will attempt to shed truth to the liberal media community, and their victims, as time permits. Thanks for stopping by. Greg.

      I laughed, I cried, I wet my pants  Go read  urlLink American Digest's  precious little gem.  But be forewarned: set your drink down before you start reading.  I might have to replace a semi-expensive monitor if the cheap rum and diet coke doesn't wipe off easily.  Jim at  urlLink Smoke on the Water  has again brought to the surface  urlLink a magnificent pearl .

      We've corrected the glitch with the "Comments", as of Monday.&nbsp; I'm not sure if comments can be added to posts before the correction.&nbsp; If not, and you want to slap us around for anything posted prior to Monday, 26 July 2004, please send your comments to me at  urlLink heywoodblogger@yahoo.com .

       urlLink Rivrdog  floats an idea that just might work, an "attention getter" for both campaigns on the Scary Looking (assault) Weapons Ban.       "To Bush, make a campaign donation of exactly Seven dollars and sixty-two cents ($7.62).....     &nbsp;   To Kerry, make a donation of twenty-two cents....."

      Jim at  urlLink Smoke on the Water  has a post worth reading  urlLink regarding the current state  &nbsp;of the democraps' party, and he again puts things in a proper historical perspective.&nbsp; Jim has a gift; who else could meld Andrew Johnson, FDR, Truman,&nbsp;Nixon, Woodward & Bernstien,&nbsp;Clinton, Sandy Berger, and Geo.W.Bush into a cohesive post?  Go read, and read the comments as well.&nbsp; His is a lively band, cussin' and discussin' the subject at hand

       urlLink Bill Whittle  has again surfaced to let us know he's OK and to call off the search party.&nbsp; Stop teasing us, dammit.....   Frank J. of  urlLink IMAO  fame has a really funny "fisking"(?) of  urlLink The Eagles' "Desparado" / Linda Ronstadt / michael moore  that you should read.&nbsp; I somewhat agree with  urlLink Rachel Lucas , "Desparado" is not all that great on it's own merits:       First of all, not every American loves that song. In fact, I myself am one American who completely freaking hates that song and always has. I think it's stultifyingly boring, and frankly, silly.

       urlLink  Rachel Lucas   offers some excellent commentary on&nbsp;Flight 327.&nbsp; Go read&nbsp;all her posts in the "Gimme Valium" series right now.&nbsp;   This whole "Flight 327" thing should drive us all into some serious introspection:&nbsp; what would you have done if you were in Annie Jacobsen's seat?&nbsp; And if there were Air Marshalls on the flight, WTF were they doing?&nbsp; The in-flight magazine is not that interesting.&nbsp; I'm actually waiting for the left to bring Flight 327 up as an example of GWB's failure to do something about terrorism at home, being an election year and all.  Go read Rachel's posts, follow the links&nbsp;and sit down and do some serious soul searching.  She also gets a couple of good whacks in&nbsp;along the way on the subject of michael moore and the hollywood left and their mis-understanding of exactly what "freedom of speech" means.&nbsp;

       It's crap like  urlLink this &nbsp;that really frosts my cookies.&nbsp; Front page of yesterday's Moscow on the Huron edition of Pravda, above the fold, in a large font is this:&nbsp;  Talk of military draft persists despite denials; Some fear mandatory service is on the horizon. &nbsp; Of course, for the aging hippies at the AnnArbor News, it's always 1968.&nbsp;  &nbsp;      Rumors about a possible draft have been circulating for months, fueled in part by Web sites such as StopTheDraft.com, which claims the draft is just "five minutes" away.        Fueled entirely by the left.&nbsp; There's no substance here, just wild-eyed speculation in smoke filled rooms after the bong has been refilled with the last of the "good stuff"      Lawmakers say it is unlikely Congress would call for compulsory service in an election year, and that the Bush administration has taken steps in the short term to shore up gaps in troop strength.      "I don't think we're going to need to reinstate the draft," said U.S. Sen. Carl Levin, Michigan's senior senator and the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. "The combination of recruitment and retention is doing fairly well. Some of the measures that have been taken will give us temporary respite from the draft possibility."      &nbsp;

      I'm sure you've seen and heard Whoopi Goldberg bitching and moaning about how her Right of Expression is being trampled because Slim Fast dumped her as their spokesman-ette because of her recent vulgar remarks about the President.  &nbsp;   urlLink  This   you must read.&nbsp; Raging_Dave over at  urlLink Four Right Wing Wackos  is spot on and slaps Whoopsie and Natalie, et al. roughly about the face and neck over their cries of "censorship".&nbsp; And he does so based on  The   Constitution , with just the right amount of piss and vinegar.&nbsp; Hey, anyone who can accurately quote The Constitution is OK in my book.  &nbsp;  Gracious thanks to Jim at  urlLink Smoke on The Water &nbsp;for the illumination.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Since we're on the subject of bumper stickers, allow me to comment on a couple I've seen lately.  &nbsp;  The first was on an old Ford Ranger pick-up; it was styled after the current GWB-04 campaign stickers, except it read "Re-Defeat Bush in 04".&nbsp; Clever.&nbsp; OK, so they're still spewing the "stolen election" / "selected, not elected" bullshit.&nbsp; Do the math, moron.&nbsp; They didn't defeat GWB, he won.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; Of the 43 lawsuits filed regarding the 2000 election results in Florida, 41 were filed by algore's team after&nbsp;every recount came up with the same result.&nbsp; Bush won.&nbsp; So take your ratty-assed pick-up with expired plates and the pizza delivery sign suction-cupped to the roof back to Delusion Central and stay out of my way.  &nbsp;  The other was on the bumper on both of the cars owned&nbsp;by people whom I love and respect.&nbsp; They take hard earned and well deserved great pride in their cars and do not place "graffiti" on their vehicles.&nbsp; On each bumper rests a small (4" square), tastefully executed decal stating "Outsource Bush".&nbsp; I honestly didn't "get it", so I asked what it meant, beyond the obvious vitriol.&nbsp; I was harangued for about 45 minutes about how GWB has personally outsourced all the decent jobs in this country.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hmmm.&nbsp; I pay pretty close attention to the news, but I don't recall the President signing any Legislation entitled "The Great Authorization for US Companies to be Required to send their Work Over-Seas and Divert the Profits to Halliburton Act" of 2003 or what-ever.&nbsp; I mean, I'm not being purposefully obtuse here;&nbsp;if you can point out the specific things the current administration has done or allowed to happen that resulted in this whole big "outsourcing" issue, I am more than willing to listen.&nbsp; I may even take up the cause, if the evidence is compelling enough.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But again, I pay pretty close attention to the news.&nbsp; I see all the economic indicators pointing in good directions.&nbsp; I see Crazy Al over at the Fed raising the prime rate because of inflation concerns, it seems that the economy is growing too fast.&nbsp; I see the left backing away from the "3 million jobs lost" line of crap as it evaporates in the harsh light of reality's noon-day sun.&nbsp; At last count, we had re-couped 2.7 million of the 3 million jobs lost&nbsp;after 11 September&nbsp;2001.&nbsp; (Note to the left: Does that date  mean   anything  to you?&nbsp; Those of us who do not suffer from a cranial / rectal inversion realize that we had a rough 4th quarter in 2001; through now fault of our own.)  &nbsp;  I'll post more "bumper sticker" musings as they come to me.&nbsp; If you've seen any good bumper stickers (for either side of the debate), please drop me a line at  urlLink heywoodblogger@yahoo.com .

      So anyway,&nbsp; The Missus and the kids and I were out and about the other evening, and she wanted to swing by the bookstore to pick up a book she wanted.&nbsp; I dropped her at the door of B.Noble-WaldenBarnes and went cruising the parking lot for a parking spot.&nbsp; Now, this particular bookstore is in AnnArbor (aka Moscow on the Huron) and shares a parking lot with Whole Foods, a hippy grocer of the first order.&nbsp; Being semi-observant, I started to take note of the bumper stickers on the cars parked in the lot.&nbsp; Discounting the "local" and "music" themed bumper stickers and focusing only on the political, there was a lot of what you'd expect for Moscow on the Huron: NARAL, NORML, GreenPeace, World Wildlife Fund, "No Blank Check For Endless War", "Not In My Name", Sierra Club, etc.&nbsp; I saw two cars with Howard "Screamer" Dean stickers, two with "GWB-04" type stickers, five with anti-GWB slogans, but only one car out of several hundred (500? more?) that had a john kerry bumper sticker.  &nbsp;   Only one.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Only one kerry sticker, on&nbsp;the quintessential AnnArbor 12 year old Volvo.&nbsp; Two GWB bumper stickers (both on late model SUVs, I'm happy to report).&nbsp; In AnnArbor.&nbsp; I have to tell you, I was quite relieved.&nbsp; I mean, there I was, in the heart of liberal-ville, where sloganism via bumper sticker is  required.&nbsp;  Relieved, indeed.  &nbsp;  For the past several weeks I have been knocking about the notion that GWB might actually lose in November.&nbsp; (Read it correctly, not that "kerry would win", because he can't win without GWB managing to lose the election).&nbsp; Polls, schmolls.&nbsp; I've long held the theory that in politics hatred is un-sustainable, eventually you have to come to the marketplace with ideas and vision.&nbsp; Your platform can't be simply "I'm not Him".&nbsp; And that's exactly what the left has been running on.&nbsp; Jebeezus, I can tell you more about algore's platform and positions on the issues than I know about  urlLink FATAC 's.&nbsp; The only time that pure hatred of a candidate or a Party has worked (for either side) was in 1976; when Gerald Ford died for Nixon's sins.  &nbsp;  What's my point, you may ask?&nbsp; Call me crazy, but I'm interpreting this as good news, from a "boots in the dirt" perspective.&nbsp; Say what you will about AnnArbor liberals (don't get me started), but they're not complete idiots.&nbsp; The fact that there aren't more kerry / edwards bumper stickers out there, in what is arguably one of, if not the most liberal of cities in this country, speaks volumes about the left's resolve and search for substance.&nbsp; Now if I could only find the link for the  urlLink "Ralph Nader for President in 04"  campaign, maybe we could swing this.....

      It strikes me that we have never layed out who we are and what this blog is all about. OK, you can guess that we are Right Wing types, but that would be judging the book by it's cover.   My brother-in-blog and I discussed putting forth a "position paper" at the onset of this blog, but as we are both fookin'  busy  we haven't gotten around to it yet. Suffice it to say that while we agree on most issues, we will probably find areas where we don't see eye to eye. We both have our "hot buttons", issues about which we are (individually) passionate.   I describe my self as a "Constitutional Conservative" and often joke that I'm so far to the Right that I scare most  Republicans . I'm the guy who carries a copy of The Constitution with me  Every.Where.I.Go.  Why, you ask? I do so because The Constitution is the second most mis-quoted document in the history of mankind (the bible / torah / koran / et al. is the first most mis-quoted document).&nbsp; It gives me great pleasure&nbsp;to produce a copy of The Constitution&nbsp;for some whinny liberal hippie type and say "Really? Here. Show me where it says that."   Whilst this is a collaborative blog, we do not collaborate on our posts.&nbsp; He posts, I post; but never "We" post. I'm sure we'll let you know if we ever do co-author anything.&nbsp; Hell, he won't even return my phone calls....."Heywood who?" indeed.   That said, if he posts something that you don't like, take it up with him. If I post something that pisses you off (and chances are good that I  will  do so), take it up with him. No, wait.....I meant take it up with me. While we operate as separate entities, we each take full responsibility for the content of this blog.&nbsp; In the event that there is something Greg posts that I disagree with, I will offer my rebuttal, all the while&nbsp;vigorously defending his right of expression.&nbsp; We're both so  Constitutional  about these&nbsp;things.&nbsp; Something about ".....our Lives, our Fortunes, our Sacred Honor....." or some-such (Yes, I know, I'm mixing Constitutional and Declaration of Independence metaphors; bite me)    And yes, I use a "screen name". Listen, the Federal Witness Protection Program has gone through a lot of effort and expense to date; I'm not about to go and blow my cover now.&nbsp; The name harkens back to the day in the mid-1990's when I was a (very minor) Big Player in the IRC world; it's been my nom de plome (gawd how I hate using french phrases)&nbsp;forever and I'll continue to use it in this idiom.  &nbsp;  We are working on fixing the glitch with the Comments, if you feel the need to slap me around in the interim e-mail me at  urlLink heywoodblogger@yahoo.com .

       So anyway  I found myself in a bookstore in the mall this afternoon.  Man, did that put me in a funk.  They had a display of Reagan "memorabilia" books on an end cap and, being in AnnArbor (aka "Moscow on the Huron")  every other shelf  on the end cap had al franken's book of psychotic ramblings, interspersed with the Reagan books.  Keep in mind that I had to walk past roughly two pallets of billyjeff's thousand page "Love ME" yawn-fest and a life sized cardboard cut out of michael moore (how many trees had to die for that?) just to get into the store.  So I end up in the "Political Commentary" section of the store (go figure) and I'm already pissed off, and there is a shelf of billyjeff's book and a shelf of hitlery's book.  Retching, I staggered away, bumbling into the next aisle.  Down on the bottom shelf, certainly not "Alphabetical By Author", I find it.  I grab the only three copies on the shelf and go back around the corner where I interspersed the clinton's books with  urlLink Ann Coulter's   urlLink  "Treason"  .  The Missus is still asking me just what the hell was so funny in the mall.....  Maybe we should start a Movement.  Sure it's not quite like Hoffman's "Steal This Book" or Arlo Guthrie's "Alice's restaurant" movement, but it sure would be fun.  The next time you are anywhere books are sold, do a little stock shuffling.  "Treason" juxtaposed with billyjeff's or hitlery's books makes a nice statement.

       urlLink  Jim   over at  Smoke on the Water  has a  urlLink chilling history lesson  for us all.  It's the kind of thing that's been fermenting in the back of my brain for a while now; just how far will the left go to make their futile point?  Several months ago, there was some noise from the left, namely the  urlLink DemocraticUnderground  about bringing on insurrection (and civil war) upon GWB's re-election.  Lefties talking about buying guns and taking it to the streets.  Of course, this is the same crowd who promised to leave the country and move to france if GWB was elected (BTW they haven't accounted for their  unconstitutional  "waiting periods") but I digress.  Jim puts it all in the historical perspective of the elections on 1968.  Perhaps I'm melding two seperate constructs here, but something tells me there's a "chill wind" blowing from somewhere left of center.....

       urlLink  Frank J.   celebrated  urlLink IMAO's  two year blogoversiary on Friday and issued a shameless plea for linkage to celebrate the date. Congradulations, Frank; keep up the good work.  I've been reading IMAO for about as long as I've been reading blogs and if you are not going there daily you are missing out on some more gooder funny.  As a primer, you should start with Frank's classic, timeless essay  urlLink  "Nuke The Moon"  .  It's so crazy, it just might work.  BTW Frank, two things: first, we celebrated a blogoversiary on Friday as well.  Friday, 9 July 2004 was  urlLink SupplySidePolitics'  two week anniversairy.  You don't linka to us, we don't linka to you....   and second, your new site design forms a seal and applies vacuum.  It's too harsh, dude.  Go back to the  proven  concept that we know and love.  Go read Frank's stuff right now

       Cassandra  over at  urlLink I love Jet Noise  does an admirable job of fisking michael moore's  urlLink op-ed  (no, not  the  box-office op-ed) in the L.A.Times.  Dammit! I was going to put that one up on a tee and take a whack at it.  I still may just do so.  Cassandra's fisking should be put up as an example of how to do it in the VRWC "style book"; she gives moore a good whacking without ever using words such as "corpulent", "flatulent", "obese", "fcuk-tard", or "siht-for-brains" when speaking of moore.  Nay, not a single "ass-hat" was uttered in her most excellent post.  Bravo, Cassandra on a job well done.  I may or may not have more to say on the subject of michael moore in the near future.  He has been pissing me off, I mean like  urlLink RCOB  pissed off, since about 1986.....there's a really long blog post worth of material here, but we don't have  urlLink Bill Whittle's  bandwidth

       Update===> The venue for the concert has been moved to Detroit's Cobo Arena. How a venue designed as a hockey stadium differs from one designed as a basketball stadium with regard to the aforementioned "production issues" is anyone's guess. I'm just sayin', that's all. Read it here:  urlLink  'Vote for Change' Springsteen show moves to Cobo   .      Original post:   Good. I needed a chuckle today. Front page, above the fold, above the masthead of today's issue of the Moscow on the Huron's edition of Pravda was this headline:    urlLink Springsteen show at Crisler in doubt

      As a hurricane survivor myself ( urlLink Celia , 3 August 1970), I feel for our friends in Florida.  urlLink "Much Stronger Than Expected"  was very much like the headline for  my  hurricane. We lived in Portland, Texas at the time (Celia's eye passed directly over Portland) and our house was completely destroyed. I was just short of 8 years old, but it left an indelible mark on me and who I am. To this day, I scoff at the weather: if there aren't four door 1969 Buicks getting tossed about by the wind, it just ain't a  storm .  I have a load of stories about the experience that I'll save for another time; now is the time for the Charlie survivors.  Here I sit, safe and dry and comfortable; with the lights (and the 'puter) still on and not having to worry about finding a safe place for my family to sleep or wondering where we'll get fresh water. And you are, too.  So if you can see your way clear to spare a few bucks; pony up at your local  urlLink RedCross  office. I'm sure that they have a "Hurricane Charlie" fund set up. No cash? Give some blood. It's all good, it all helps.  If you have the time and are available, load the truck up with bottled water and diapers and cans of tuna and batteries and some bottled water and first aid kinda thingies and maybe a bottle of rum or two and some bottled water and your hammer and work gloves and sturdy boots and a couple of sheets of plywood and some bottled water and some 2 x 4s and some more water and some duct tape and some heavy gauge plastic sheeting and some bottled water and a couple of bottles of rum and head on down and help. Be sure to coordinate with the RedCross (do your own Google search, dammit), they can direct you to the communities that need the most help. When you get there, find the neighborhoods that were impoverished  before  Charlie and help there first.  BTW: If you ever wanted to know what a "hero's welcome" felt like, stop at a Piggly Wiggly about 150 miles out and put a couple of dozen cases of popsicles / fudgesicles/ creamsicles on dry ice. Trust me, you hand a popsicle to an  adult  shortly after a hurricane and you'll be a hero. Just imagine how you'll look to the kids.

      Sigh  I've been falling below my self imposed standards for frequency in blogging lately. Sorry. Imagine that, letting Real Life get in the way of the on-line existence. But it's not just me.....   urlLink Lileks  is on vacation,  urlLink denBeste  is giving it a miss for the Dog Days.  urlLink Whittle  is kinda back, with another teaser about the forthcoming "Tribes" essay and the book.  urlLink Frank  is still working out the kinks; and  urlLink Misha  is just falling flat with me lately (".....it's not you, it's me.....").  urlLink Ann  is mailing it in once a week. My Brothers-in-Blog on this and other endeavors seem to be missing as well.  My personal theory is that everyone is resting up until after Labor Day. Once we're in the electoral home stretch, I believe the blogosphere will positively glow with a white hot brightness.  Lileks hit upon something a couple of days ago: SBHFS (Sudden Bush Hatred Fatigue Syndrome) where you just can't take it anymore and need a break from it all. Maybe that's it.  Maybe we've reached our limit of all the baseless hatred spewed by the left and their willing accomplices. Maybe we need tin-foil hats of our own, to insulate our brains from the barrage of crap that gets shoveled on a daily basis. Maybe we should drink more. I don't know.  There are a few giggles out there;  urlLink Ironbear  has a list of definitions that makes you think and chuckle. And I recently discovered  urlLink VodkaPundit ; go read his "50 Things" lists for some ponderous laughs.

      Bravo to Bonnie Raitt for getting it right and understanding How.It.Works. Am I going to go out and burn all my copies of her LPs / CDs / 8-tracks (8-tracks? WTF?) because of her views? No. I'm a "blues" guy and have appreciated Ms. Raitt's work for decades. The blues is the blues, if you know what I mean. She's entitled to her opinion, because she understands:     "This is the first time I've felt moved to get behind something I that I feel is an emergency," said Raitt. "This is the most important election of our lifetime.  I am willing to lose fans ... I am a citizen as well an artist and I am willing to take the hit for something I believe in ." [Emphasis mine]    Contrast her statement ".....willing to take the hit for something I believe in....." to the whining put forth by the likes of whoopie goldberg / tim robbins / natalie maines / et al. Ms.Raitt has taken her position, regardless of the consequences. She knows how it works. Being ridiculously Constitutional, while I disagree with her position, I'll vigorously defend her right to espouse her views.  If you're of strong stomach, go read the source article:  urlLink Stars explain motivation for political concert tour .  I have a couple of beefs with the article's author, Roger Lelievre (sounds french, but what do I know?), the AnnArbor New's Arts Writer:  First, factual:     Presidential politics and music have had an uncomfortable relationship recently. Just ask Linda Ronstadt and the Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines. Both vocalists made derogatory comments about President Bush during shows, with protests greeting their remarks.     No, Rog; Ronstadt got booted in LasVegas for dedicating "Desparato" to michael moore and protests greeted her comments. Lumping her in with maines, who overtly made anti-GWB comments (whilst over-seas, thinking that no one in the USA would ever know, nudge, nudge, wink, wink) is intellectually dis-honest.  Second, literary:     "This is the first time I've felt moved to get behind something I that I feel is an emergency," said Raitt. "This is the most important election of our lifetime. I am willing to lose fans ... I am a citizen as well an artist and I am willing to take the hit for something I believe in." Alienating fans is a definite possibility, Mills said, "but I believe the outcome of this election is far more important even than my career."     He quotes Ms.Raitt and Mr.Mills in the article before introducing them in context. Bite me, I'm in William Safire mode tonight.  Other excerpts from the article and commentary:     The artists will tour under the name "Vote For Change," with money generated going to America Coming Together, a political action group affiliated with the liberal group MoveOn and aimed at defeating President George W. Bush. Other musical acts participating nationally include the Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, Dave Matthews Band, Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, James Taylor, John Mellencamp and Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds. Other artists a could be added, organizers said.     All members of "the usual suspects". Nothing to see here, move on.     Mark McKinnon, the media director for the Bush campaign, said, "We think it's unfortunate these particular fine musicians have decided to affiliate with a hate-filled fringe group like MoveOn." But McKinnon said that Bush had drawn his own support from the entertainment world, citing stars like Lee Ann Womack,Kid Rock and Jessica Simpson.     What?  Who the hell is jessica simpson? Now animated characters have a voice in presidential politics? Who does  urlLink Bug-eyed Earl  support? Enquiring minds want to know, dammit.     Mills said artists are donating their services. All funds raised beyond expenses will go to America Coming Together.     "All funds beyond expenses" indeed. Have you seen the cost of cocaine lately? "America Coming Together" is going to get stuck with one hell of a bar tab.     There have been a number of highly publicized efforts to encourage election participation, particularly by young people, among them Rock the Vote. Mills said he thinks the combined effort of everyone involved will get attention and make an impression.   Hell, it got billyjeff elected.....     "It's not so much myself, or R.E.M., or any one artist that's involved in this. It's the fact that there are so many, coming from such diverse places on the musical spectrum, all coming together for this single purpose," he said.     Bravo to this Mr.Mills, whoever he may be. Go read the article, he comports himself as understanding how it works.  And I'm all for encourging election participation. Ab-so-fookin-lutely. Just don't stand on queue next to me in the voting line with your UAW "Vote for the following people" card in hand, unless you want an ear-full.     Raitt added that thought the purpose of the concerts is political, the focus will be on this music.       "We don't see hours of haranguing speeches and 20 minutes of music," she said.     Not fookin' likely. More people lit up American flags and pictures of GWB at this year's "AnnArbor Hash Bash" than they did joints.  Reach Roger LeLievre at rlelievre@annarbornews.com.
