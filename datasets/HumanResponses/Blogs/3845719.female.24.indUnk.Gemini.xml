      ...The novelty wore off after a couple of weeks.  I've seen her wandering around the neighborhood in her nightgown and yelling at people who drive by. Once i got stopped by her when I came home from work. She grabbed ahold of my hand and wouldn't let go. I had to pry her off finger by finger.  The other day I brought a balloon home from work and threw it out with the trash when it got flat. The next morning, I saw it hanging from her railing. Who digs through the dumpster and opens trash bags for a balloon? I know it was my balloon, too, because it was a specially made blue and yellow one.  About a week ago, we went to the neighborhood bar for a drink. Kay was there, carrying around a squeaky dog toy. I think she thought she was pretty hot shit, too, because she was hanging all over a couple of guys there and squeaking the toy in their faces. Eventually, the bartender cut her off and she ended up hooking up with some young drunk kid. She never came home that night.

      ...here I am, creating a blog. Where should I begin?   I moved into my current apartment complex eight months ago. I always joked with my boyfriend Francesco that it was a  "retirement community" because most people here are twice our age. We never met any of our neighbors because everyone kept to themsleves. Until mid May, that is. It was about that time that Kathy stopped taking her medication and started drinking vodka. Heavily.  Kathy is the tenant who lives directly across the street from us. Approximately three times a week, always between three and four in the morning, the police, firetrucks, and paramedics have been called to her unit. We always have a  perfect view of everything. At first, it was quite interesting, but....

      I hear strange noises coming from outside. I step out on my balcony and discover Kay rooting around in the weeds in the canyon behind my apartment:  urlLink     Later, Kay is yelling at the neighbor above her. Something about having some friends over. "Charlie's Angels!" she yells. "Three white cats!" "It's Christmas eve!" She spends the evening tinkering around with stuff on her patio. The next morning.....

      Not much has changed. Kay still digs through the dumpster, puts stuff in the trash then takes it back, and harrasses passing vehicles. Here's a good example:  urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     These three young men were visiting a friend I believe. Kay stops them as they are leaving and tries to get them to come over to her house. "Hey, red shirts!" she calls. "I have carne asada! And corn on the cob! I'm going to have a feast!" The boys stand around awkwardly, not knowing how to politely decline the crazy lady. They eventually just get in their car and leave, while she calls after them "Come back in half an hour! I'll have a feast ready for you!"

      Francesco stopped at the Vons grocery store near us on his way home. Guess who was there?    urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     She was carrying around a Fedex package and harrassing anyone who walked by. Fran said she was darting out into traffic to try to get someone to stop and give her a ride.

      All was quiet, so I ventured outside to clean up our garage a bit. Kay snuck up on me and scared me nearly to death! She came into my garage and told me she needed help. She said she was a secret agent hired to protect me from the police. Fabulous! I always wanted my own secret agent. She told me she had been drugged and "they" took her away. "They" put drugs in her beer and took her ID and money. She had to sell her truck for $1000 to get home. "They" took her phone and now she needed my help, do I have a phone she could use? Like perfect timing, my cell phone rang. It was Francesco, telling me he was on his way home. The phone call freaked Kay out, she thought it was "them" and they were looking for her. She wanted me to follow her to her apartment so she could show me something. I refused and asked her to please leave. As soon as Francesco pulled up, she said "they're here!" and scurried off to hide in her apartment.

      It has been quiet the last three days... no crazy Kay until today. She's back from wherever she went.  For the last hour, I've been watching Kay bring food to the dumpster. She's not throwing anything away, just bringing everything from her kitchen and putting it on top of and around the dumpster. The crows are watching her, too, and she keeps hollering that she's going to call the cops on them.  I left for half an hour and returned around 9:40 and everything was gone! She spent the rest of the morning going through the trash and taking things back to her apartment.

      Kay was outside yelling and screaming again. On several occasions, she hollered that she was "throwing all her shit away", as if all us neighbors weren't well aware. This time she left an ugly black chair under our tree, and there were lamps, cushions, boxes, and bags full of her crap in and around the dumpster. I called the police again at approximately 8:30 because she showed no signs of letting up.   The manager of the apartment complex arrived at 9:00 a.m. on the dot. He'd been inundated with complaints from neighbors and came to see for himself what the hell was going on. He attempted to talk to Kay, but that just got her more riled up. She screamed at him for awhile but all I could make out was that "she had a house to clean". She got so upset that she left. She just walked away and left all her crap all over the street.   I spoke with the manager about her behavior and gave him a hand-written complaint documenting everything. He said that he had already been in contact with his legal team to see what he could do without violating her rights. HA! I also had the pleasure of finally meeting some of my other neighbors. They were surprisingly sane and we had lots of juicy stories to share. The police never even bothered to show up. I left for work shortly after that, and we didn't see Kay again for a few days.

      Kay returned. I was woken up by the sound of a vehicle being revved up. Apparently, she was trying to park her truck in the garage. The crash that followed confirmed this, as it sounded like she drove straight THROUGH the garage. Shortly after this she began "cleaning". She was throwing objects off her patio into the street, and I watched her as she walked back and forth taking her things to the dumpster. Of course, every time she threw something away she had to slam the lid down on top of it. I finally fell back asleep, but not for long.

      I awoke to Kay yelling outside. I observed her standing next to her truck and a dark SUV. She was yelling at the driver of the SUV, then suddenly she jumped into her truck and left at a high rate of speed. The SUV followed.

      We were out of town for a week and who knows what we missed? Things picked up right where they left off, however. At 8:20 this evening, I heard Kay screaming and went outside. Kay's red truck was parked haphazardly in the middle of the street. The door was open and the hazard lights were flashing. I observed her yelling at a woman with two small children who just happened to be walking by. Kay was threatening to kill herself and yelled at the woman to "go ahead and call the cops to come find my dead body", and "I want the cops to shoot me". At this point I called the police and was informed that they had already received three other reports and the police were on their way. The police arrived just before 9:00 p.m. Kay claimed nothing was wrong and that she was just sitting outside. She denied everything, and after the police locked up her truck and told her to "keep it down", they left. Completely normal behavior, right?

      My crazy neighbor is at it again today. She had a heart attack, and someone is trying to kill her. She has also decided to have a garage sale. Busy day for her. She left this ratty blue leather chair under our tree. What should we do with it? I figure we could put the chair in the dumpster, or put it right outside her door so she can't get out.  This reminds me of another story. One time she was ranting and raving about her ex after she found one of his shirts. So, she picked up dog poop with it, threw up on it, and threw it in the dumpster. She sure showed him! I should have gotten it out of the dumpster and left it on her porch.  Anyway. What the hell is on her head?   urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink

      After being woken up several times by the firetrucks outside our window, we decided to start taking pictures. June 1 through June 5, the police and paramedics came to visit Kay four times. They hauled her off to the county mental hospital on the evening of June 5:  urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink

      10:00 a.m. Kay is delivered back to her apartment by the San Diego police. They kindly deposit her and the picnic in her head back into the care of her "concerned" neighbors. My guess is her financing didn't go though. She had already defaced the car and loaded it full of her shit before the dealer finally figured out she couldn't pay for it and had the police give her a ride home.  urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     10:30 a.m. That didn't phase old Kay, though! She spent the afternoon playing with more balloons I'd left in the dumpster for her and playing frisbee with a paper plate that she found in our trash:  urlLink     urlLink     urlLink

      Last night was a surprisingly uneventful fourth of July. Kay left with some young kid around 9:00 p.m. We expected her to return home all riled up, but we didn't see her again until around 8:00 this morning. She returned home driving a brand new car with the car salesman in tow. I'm sure everyone in the complex heard her hollering that she bought this new car. She made the salesman wait outside for 40 minutes while she crammed a picnic basket full of beer and grabbed some "friends". She christened her new car with an American flag sticker and off they went! It was the fourth of July, and she's an American, God dammit!  urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink

      At lunch, Francesco told me that earlier this morning he'd heard some scuffling noises outside our window and observed Kay retrieving the bag of trash we'd thrown into the dumpster. She emptied out the bag, and took it home with her. We decided to leave her a little present. We finished our quarter pounder and salad and left a few tidbits in the box for her. Then, we left the box and a nearly empty coke on top of the dumpster. Sure enough, half an hour later, Francesco caught her drinking my coke and taking the box home with her (note yet another wardrobe change):  urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     This gave us another idea, and we quickly went to work preparing a victoria's secret bag full of leftover slop. I tied a pretty balloon to it and strategically placed it in the dumpster. Not fifteen minutes passed before she came to claim her prize:  urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink

      Kay is home. We had the pleasure of watching her play in the pool today. She used her next door neighbor's hose to  fill the pool and water the street for an hour and a half. Later we overheard her telling another neighbor that this  was "the best fourth of July of her entire life!"  urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink

      Kay is arguing with the neighbor who lives above her and something sets her off. She has a tantrum and starts throwing things into the street. At one point she opens a bottle of juice and starts splashing the contents onto the street and building. She runs over to the canyon behind our apartment and begins screaming at the top of her lungs. She repeatedly screams "Fuck you, Bo!" to the neighbor who got her all riled up.   5:15 p.m.  Her friends from the police department arrive, and decide to take her back to county mental health:  urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     All of her belongings are still outside, and the police kindly return them to her apartment for her.   urlLink     urlLink     I talk with my other neighbors and discover what set her off: Bo refused to let her bum a cigarette.

In this picture she is presenting one of them with what appears to be a DVD player. It could also be a DVD player box full of crap. Who knows? He puts the prize into his garbage truck and he and his partner leave without even collecting our trash!   urlLink

      The carpet cleaner is trying to collect payment for his services. A few days ago, she ran water on her patio all afternoon. My guess is she flooded her apartment and messed up the carpet. Her claim is the sewage is leaking into her apartment from the apartment above her. Whatever the case, Kay has no money. She claims she is worth millions, but she can't pay the carpet cleaner. She goes next door to Lisa's apartment, bangs on the door, and borrows $40 to pay the carpet guy:  urlLink
