       The last part of today was killer!!&nbsp; All the business out of the way i got to just sit in the 80 degree weather with a nice breeze blowing and let my mind just clear.&nbsp; It's rare for me to go more than 15 minutes doing nothing before get antsy and have to be doing or thinking about something.&nbsp; Not today, I can count the number of times on one hand&nbsp;where&nbsp;I've had a moment of clarity like i did today, and it was great.&nbsp; No thoughts running throught my head and just soaking up my surroundings and being alive.&nbsp; It lasted for about 3 hours and it was great, i wish i could go to that place on demand.&nbsp;   Well shortly after i sort of came back to my surroundings, i thought long and hard about my life and how i felt about it.&nbsp; My journey up to this point has been up and down and inbetween but, in the last year or so the dicipline, and the intentionality that i have been living with has made me feel that i have chosen an outlook of perpetual happiness.&nbsp; There are obviously time where my state of emotion isn't joy, but as i look at circumstances, and how i have chosen to deal with them, the only lasting feeling&nbsp;i have is gratitude for being shown and choosing a path of total accountability.&nbsp;   The choices i have made lead to no other path than total happiness, and those choices will never lead another direction.&nbsp; it's a pretty great feeling.&nbsp;   Nite

       well... interesting evening tonight.  I spent a couple hours in the studio with peter finishing up this little project for eric.  Wierd sort of trance piece that's way out of my league but it went good.  So he asks me if i want to go out with him, Gabe O, Julie, and one of their other friends.  Whilst getting ready for that foolishness, i got a call from Mindy, and her friend Andrea.  I met Andrea last Christmas when the whole crew went out to the blue moon and unfortunatly all i can remember is getting her phone number (alcohol bad)  and that i never did call her up to hang out.  So anyway, i thought that things might be a complete disaster, due to the level of ass i probably was last time i was around her, but it was a good nite.      Saw Morgan, and Rachel, that was kind of random.  Ha, of all places, they were at the Lush....go figure.   Also saw Melissa...hmmmm...nothing to say at this time.       I often ponder who i am and my personality, and it doesn't click so much with other people.  I feel that i am a genuinly nice person (not that i can't be corrupted by the right somebody) but, for the most part I would rather just be the kind, considerate, person I feel I am, all the time.  Most people tho, for some reason find this annoying, or weak.  I can't tell you how many times i've been dismissed for being too nice....WHAT THE FUCK!!  Too nice?  I'm sick of being around a scene where you have to be a dick, and a total slimeball for people to interact with you.  You all may think i'm being melodramatic, but DAMN.  Just go out to a bar and ask a girl if you can buy her a drink and just tell her that she looks pretty tonight.  See how quickly you get the eye roll.  Or see how quick someone tries to start something for complementing them...it's amazing how people respond to negativity.      Anyway, again nothing of real substance to say just mostly musings.      nite all    Mule

       I just heard an interesting interview with Ron Regan Jr. on NPR.  He had an interesting description of his view of atheisim, in that he didn't beleve in a heaven or a hell.  He thought more so that they were metaphor for how one lived thier life.  He said that in his case he didn't feel the need the fear of hell to compel him to live a good life.  Interesting...  I would say that I identify with this point of view more than any form of religious doctrine/dogma, and the inevitable zealotry that arises from it.  The realization of being completly responsible for your life, actions and consequences, without the ability to pawn off the responsibility and consequences or mistakes or decisions on some divine law or interpertation of it,  is core to Mr. Regans point of view.  But, it still leaves one open to the incorporation of a spiritual element of guidance or companionship in what ever from it may take.  I often times see religous instutions by direct intent or accidental consequence, empowering individuals to give up the joy, and responsibility, of total control over their life, decisions, circumstances, and consequences.  In essence, exchanging ones earthly freedoms for eternal salvation.   Aww... look at me trying to be all philosophical  :-)

       Oy...So i had my post op visit with the doc for my shoulder. Everything is going as planned, and i should be moving on down the road to full use of my arm in the next month or so. It's wierd that even though i have total confidence in the the doctor that did the sugery, and a general optimism about the sugery in general, it's always nice to be "out of the woods" and just move on. The blessing of near perfect health is one i don't think too many people appriciate enough.     I recently started a song writing class with one of the most talented singer/songwriter/producer/jack of all musical trades here in portland, Jim Walker. I don't really condiser myself much of a "song writer" or anything like that, when it comes to music i usually gravitate toward the technical end of things. I love audio engineering, mixing, etc. but i will always jump at the chance to learn a craft from talented people who are willing to teach, after all you can never learn too much.     Being a self admitted voyer, I enjoyed some of the excercises that put us in the mall listening to conversations, and observing the marketing vomit that surrounds us everyday. Then writing down quotes, and slogans that pave the way for creative metaphor, and inspiration in the song writing process. The mallrat walk was only one of several unique, but equally useful ways to look and observe my world in a different way. Supa fun!!

       So, i'm hammered today.  I spent like 8 hours in the studio with Jared working on his tunes, which are coming along very nicley.  We didn't leave till the sun was coming up in the sky.  Needless to say it's been a day filled with yawns and fighting drowsiness!  Things are plugging along quite well business wise, and it looks like there are a few more fun/interesting things coming down the pike that will be fun and challenging, so i'm looking forward to that.      I've decided to go full fleged geek...i'm delving more and more into programming and am soon going to be regularly mentoring with my brother who happens to be one of the most talented programmers around.  I'll be kind of fun, i'll get to fly to his work a couple times a month and shadow him, and get to absorb his genius jucies (that sounds gross).

       So, tommorow ought to be pretty fun.  A bunch of us are heading down to the waterfront to take in the redbull flugtag.  For any of you that don't know what this is, basically it's a bunch of nuts that make contraptions that have no business trying to fly, then they launch them off a thirty foot high platform into the river.  Contestants are judged on distance and creativity, and the winners get the option of getting free flying lessons, or a year long free airfare package to anywhere in the world.   Anyway should be fun.  The company should be pretty good too.   Lates,  Mule

       I was sitting in coffee time, and reading a book about object orentied programming, and my mind began to wander a bit. I started thinking about how if it was at all lucrative I could very easily see myself being a perpetual student. I love learning, I love experiencing new things.     If you saw my GPA in highschool you would seem to be lead in to a different conclusion. The thing is though, I love to learn with one caveat. I love to learn for the sake of knowledge, the sake of enlightenment, the sake of learning about the world that surrounds me. I do not however like learning the minimum of information needed to pass a test.     Of the most valuable things that my parents have given me, the choice to do what ever i chose with the years during highschool was by far and away on the top of the list. It was in my exploration of doing the direct opposite of that which was requested by me of the schooling system that I was in, that I experience the most character growth, and i learned how to interact with the world around me.     Standardized testing, and the need for school staff to play the roll of legal guardian, and not life mentors, has in my opinion turned the most crucial developmental period in one's life into a quest for getting students to play and manipulate the game of education. Unfortunatly the fruits of playing and manipulating the game of education instill few lasting, or impactful values that can be used during the course of one's life.     Most of the time I chalk this up to the need for people to have a measuring stick in life and you simply can't measure character growth, or life experiences. And although I, and many other educaters, feel that these should be the focus in the process of elementary, and highschool education, the political need for something to concretly measure, the need for something that can be analyzed by a simple set of data and percentages always wins out in todays society.     I long for a solution, but in reality as long as society needs a number to qualify the quality of a students highschool experience, raising the numbers will always be the priority, mostly by default, but sometimes deliberatly at the expence of the growth in character, and values in the youth of the nation.

       I've been reading a book by Wayne Dyre, called "There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem".  Wayne is one of my favorite authors because everytime I read a chapter, or a passage I get snapped out of my own self absorbed reality.  I read a couple pages today that speciffically applied to the overall theme of this book, which is that every problem in life is created and perpuated in the physical world, and to any physical world problem there is a spiritual solution.  He describes the difference between the spiritual and physical worlds as the world of low vibration (physical world) and high vibration (spiritual world).      Regardless of you ever buy into his view of humanity and spiritualy there is one thought that remains true.  Problems are created by the person experiencing them.  If we have the power to create problems at will, do we not have the power to also solve them at will.  I believe we do, and that moves me on to the question if physical world problems can be solved by bring a spiritual world view/presence, who's to say that we can't solve other peoples physical world problems, by bringing the same spiritual presence to bear.      I've found that by meditating (as taught by a variety of spirtual leaders) morning and evening that, this spiritual awareness tends to stick around during the day and I have a different experience than when I just get up and go, or get tired and fall asleep.  I'm still sort of in an abstract stage here, but i'm experiencing things that have been a mystery to me before, but i now see them with a measure of clarity.  Pretty fun, and captivating.      Anyway,     Laters

       This being human is a guest house  Every morning a new arrival.    A joy, a depression, a meanness,  Some momentary awareness comes  As an unexpected visitor.     Welcome and entertain them all!  Even if they're a crowd of sorrows,   Who violently sweep your house  Empty of its furniture,  Still, treat each guest honorably.  He may be clearing you out  For some new delight.    The dark thought, the shame, the malice,  Meet them at the door laughing,  And invite them in.    Be grateful for whoever comes,  Because each has been sent  As a guide from beyond.     ( The Essential Rumi;  translated by Coleman Barks; Harper Collins, 1995; p. 104)

       So i got home last night....What gong show. I was supposed to take my buddy Chris's grill back to him cause i've had it since the fourth of July. So i blast down to the U-Haul to get a trailer and get the thing all hooked up and go inside to pay for it, and BLAMMO forgot my wallet a home.     So i go out and unhook the trailer, and drive all the way home, and all the way back to U-Haul, and get the trailer all hooked up for a second time. I go in to pay and she's like "Ok i need a dollar deposit, and the trailer rental is 9.95. I go to whip out the credit card like a champ.....SHITE i left the fucking thing in my pants pocket from the trip home.     So...I unhook the trailer AGAIN, and by now the 90 degree heat is starting to get to me. I'm soaked to the bone from sweating cause did i mention...IT'S FUCKING 90 DEGREES HERE!!! I smell like the bottom of a garbage can that hasn't been emptied for three weeks, and i've got to drive my ass all the way home and back one more time!!! But oh no it doesn't end there.     I zip on home, grab the offending pair of pants, and chuck them into the car, while simultaniously looking at my watch realizing that the U-Haul closes in five minutes and it takes me ten to get out there. By now i was so pissed I thought ok i'll just give it a whirl and broke every traffic law trying to get back to U-Haul before they close. Well as was my luck last night i drove up just in time for them to be closing the gate on the rental yard.     I only tell this story because I crack myself up upon reflection of situations like this. All i can do is laugh. Owell, no one was harmed in the making of this memory so all is good. :-) Hope everyone has a good day and just remember to think before you spend all that enegry getting angry. It's so unrewarding :-P     Laters

I know that probably lot's of people feel this way but i've got the best parents there is to offer!  I have no idea where i'd be with out em.   I just got done with an evening at Bacchaus with Tim, Jim and friends, and what an evening.  It doesn't get much better than that!  Anyway.  I'm heading to the beach this weekend for a little bit of rest and focus.  I'm looking forward to the escape!   I won't be posting 4 a bit but i'm coming straight back from the trip and heading straight to the racetrack, to help alan with his pit duties.  I haven't seen that HO for like 4 months, so it will be good to catch up with him and the rest of the crew.  I remember the first trip i ever took to Sears Point with him.   Man what a time.  There are few people you meet in life that you are just friends with and will always be friends with.  Ploon, Geo, The Rear Admiral, Matty Z and the whole crew....I can't wait to see those ho's on sunday.  So until then  Sleep well to all!!

I'm really looking forward to taking in the inspiration of the beach and nature.  I love the city but the little things like being able to see the stars at night, and the sunsetting on the water.  Those things you just can't get here in town and serve as a source of inspiration to me.   In anycase it will be a good time and i look forward to rambling about it when i get back :-)   Nite

       Hmmm... 1:11 AM and I can't sleep. My mind just keeps racing. I used to fight this, but now I just kind of go with it. With a few exceptions I mostly just go with things. I've learned the hard way that the more you resist things the more of those things usually show up. It's not a hard and fast rule but i've more often than not found that to be true so there...  Met a girl who's pretty groovy. Haven't picked up a vibe from her yet. She's quite pretty and we've hung out a couple of times but I can't yet tell if she enjoys the Mule's company or if she's just humoring me, either way i'll take it for now :-)  I had the first sort of formal meeting with Mead Labs people and that went well. All the other projects i'm working on right now don't provide a ton in the way of cash flow and this one has the potential to give me a decent amount of scratch in the next six months or so. Possibly enough to purchase a place of my own in the next year or so, thusly i'm going on yet another balls to the wall push to make the most of it. I've got enough irons in the fire, all with their upsides and downsides. Putting them all together stacks up to be a pretty promising 4-5 years financially.  Anyway i'm gonna lay down and try to saw some logs  Nite

       Have you ever tried to make a soufle' (sp?).  Here's what i hate about soufle's or any pastry for that matter.  I don't hate the product it self, what i hate is the people who tell you how to make it.  You see these pastry chef's on tv that have been making pastries for their whole lives and you think ah that doesn't look too hard.....BOOM your doomed right there.  The problem lies in that you never see the process involved in making the pastry you just see the beautiful product.  You never see the huge team of people who actually do the work, you never see the chef actually burn himself on the oven door, you don't see the fact that they've made three of the same pastry before they got one that looked good enought to eat.   I don't know i'm only really ranting here cause last night I tired to make a pastry, and i'm pretty sure i burned the shite out of my arm.  It took like 6 hours instead of 2 and I think i kneaded the dough too much cause the final product was kinda hard and not too fluffy.  Owell I guess there's always next time.  On another note i had a pretty exhausting but fun day.  I hit up the redbull flugtag, which was hilarious!  Super crowded (heard from the announcer that they shut the gates down at 35,000 people, and there was at least that many or more on the waterfront and the other side of the river.  Then i spent the rest of the afternoon hanging out with Mindy, her boyfriend Garth, and Andrea.  Nice lunch at Rock Bottom, then a marathon session at the Put Put Golf course.  I won the first 18 and we were all so beat from the sun and walking all day that we didn't keep score and skipped a few hole in lew of ordering up some tasty beverages at the local watering hole next door.  I came home and worked for longer than i should have on designing the Mead Labs website (well at least outlining what my poor little mind thinks it should look like, then too bed.   Off to breakfast with the coolest grandparents on the face of the earth for my grandpas birth day, will be good he just got back from treatment for cancer and things are all good so this will be fun.

       So, I was digging through some old foto's and I thought it'd be worth scanning some in and posting em for a laugh. For those about to rock I salute you, get ready for some old skool pix            This was back in the day when the Wilson's still had their house in black butte. Fun times! There are assorted buddies, Peto, Angie, Eric, etc.             These are good for a laugh. See at P.A.A. we didn't have "dances" cause dancing was evil. We had "banquets" so here are some pictures that are rather telling of what a Knob I was in high school. How did i convince all those hot women to go out with me?!?           So there's some snowboarding/wakeboarding shots. They're all pretty early on when I wasn't so good but what ever, funny to look at anyway.  Ok this next set I know i'm going to get hell over!! But owell it represented a pretty good time as I remember it. As for all else involved, they probably thought I was a retard but what can you do. I'll always look back with good memories and a little regret :-)  Can you blame me?          Anyway there's more where that came from but I won't bore you all any longer.   I still have a bunch more pix to scan in, and when I've got some time I'll post a few more up here.   lata,  Mule

       Wow...It's thursday and the weekend is starting off good already.  I went out to coffee with my good friend Trisha.  This is always a good thing.  There are very few people in life that you can just "be" with ya know.  You can say something without judgement, you can feel safe, you know you have total trust.  With that dynamic it's soo good to be able to be myself.  I sometimes get portions of that with other people, and it sometimes comes and goes, but I can't think of any time really that it has ever been any different with her.  Even when I know i've been an ass!  Got to hold on to what's good for sure.  So if you read this Trisha, you already know but thanks for being my friend!!  Tyler caught himself a good one!    My bro is coming into town this weekend.  Were gonna talk business and he's mentoring me again on the programming end of things.  I've got several projects that are cooking, like i've mentioned a billion times before, that are all coming to a head and keeping me real busy as of late.  Some days there's not actually alot of work to do but the strategizing is soo draining.  It seems like you've worked for 14 hours even though is only six.  You get done and you just don't want to do anything but veg, do nothing that requires thought.  So that's that, it ought to be good.    I'm pretty sure i'm going to the crash up derby at the fair grounds on friday.  Nothing better than a true white trash event in the heart of white trash clark county.  It ought to be a blast.  Geo is actually talking about wanting to put together a car with a couple of people and entering next year.  That would be hilarious!  This whole scheme got cooked up over dinner last night.  Did I already mention how much I enjoyed that!  I have got to make a concerted effort to hang out with Geo, Tina, Pleuntang, and Patti more often.  I can't recall a time where I didn't have fun with them.... That too is rare to find!  It was also pretty interesting at dinner with this girl I've hung out with.  I think my M.O. is a little confusing to her maybe, if not a little frustrating.    Anyone who knows me at all knows that I'm not one to really play games when it comes to relationships.  I pretty much say it how it is, and I don't really read into alot of "what's he thinking" "what's she thinking" stuff.  I also take quite awhile learning and getting to know people, I just so much enjoy great friendships, over the need for a title to the relationship.  I think that's frustrating for most people, and  comes off as ambiguity, or me being uninterested.  Not the case at all, but I think that waaaaay too many people just don't talk about how the feel or who they are because it's easier to just say "Were not dating" and do the things that people who aren't seeing each other do, or to say "We are together" and do the default things that couples do.  I love the "tension" inbetween.  I mean lets be honest, it's great knowing you have a boyfriend or girlfriend.  But I think there's alot that gets overlooked in building a relationship with someone, when you have to put a label on things just to justify hanging out with someone one on one, or getting to know them intimately (sp?).  Anyway, alot of the time I don't communicate the whole spiel above very well and frankly some people find it a bother, or a waste of time to not be building, or engaging into a relationship where there is no direction or a set goal to be working towards.  For some reason most people can't just "be" and enjoy the time inbetween until you both decide to go deeper.  Anyway, enuff of that.  Just how I feel at the moment.   Well I'm pretty beat, so i'm gonna hit the hay.    Sweet dreams to all.    King of the Asses

       Well, i had an interesting night tonight.  Great dinner with the crew, planned on going home and got a call from Peto, and went out for a beer.  Anyway, it's midnight, and i'm ready to hit the sack.  All i got to say is who knew the mule had "Game".... I actually don't but that's what peto tells me.  Actually i owe a big thanks to him cause he's putting down a killer (i haven't heard it yet, but i know it will be killer) organ part on the song Jim and I have been working on.  Peto thinks It's about Ash Wart, but he's completly wrong.  Actually Jim came up with the idea of a dude talking about his DEAD observation of his murder by his wife.  It's really good, and i'm soo stoked about working with Jim.  Most of the time I think He's humoring me, cause he's really come up with the majority of the ideas for this song, but the lessons i've learned throughout the process are just awesoeme!!  Thanks to Jim, for the lessons, thanks to Andrea for not thinking I'm a complete loser.  Thanks to Steve, Peto, and Alisa for the beer, and we'll see you all real soon!    Laters,  Mule

       So I grabbed a couple of pics of the old camera, and thought I'd post em' up. Unfortunatly I only have pics from the first day cause I accidently left my camera outside the first night and it got rained on. Digital cameras don't seem to do to well with water....   urlLink      Tyler, Trish, and Brittany   urlLink      The lovely, and extreeeeeemly happy Bobby   urlLink      Trish and Tyler were about the most prepared of anyone i've ever been camping with. They fed us up right good!!   urlLink      Peto settin up the tent   urlLink      The whole crew on the beach   urlLink       urlLink       urlLink      The sunset the first night was kinda shittie, but i still felt the urge to snap a few   urlLink      Just more pics of everyone on the biach   urlLink      Something about the stormy Oregon coast... I love it!!  Well there you have it. Steve, and Alisa came out on Saturday but like i said my camera was knackered, so you'll have to imagine the fun, and mayham that you all missed out on. Anyway, hope you enjoy.  Mule

       Ya ever get that feeling like you just can't relate to anyone. I have a fairly tight knit bunch of friends who love me despite what a gomer I am. These people understand that i'm a gomer, that I will probably say something stupid, or completly retarded at almost every encounter. They realize that I will probably trip on every concrete crack in the sidewalk, and spill red wine on my white shirt when eating.  The thing is that beneath all the gomerness, and occasional insensitivity, there's the real me trying to escape. I think certian people see that quicker, and with more depth than others, and they stick around long enough to get to know me. The thing that frustrates me more than anything about myself is that I don't care enough about looking cool, or saying exactly the right thing enough to have most people stick around. The fact that I don't have the time, and I flat out don't care to put effort into a little facade that draws people in long enough to open up makes me feel a little alienated most of the time.  I can't determine inside myself if intentionally putting that little mask together, and wearing it out and about a little, translates to hypocracy. It seems too much like those shitty little sales gimmiks that sales people use because they know the product they're selling is a total pile of dookie.  So they do every thing they can to get you to put your money in the mail and buy their product by spending all their time developing these little gimmicks. Thing is smart people, intelligent people, people of substance, see through the marketing gimmiks right away and consequently avoid being sucked in or spending any capital on the product or the salesman. I guess it all depends what my goal is, to meet and develop relationships with lots of people who aren't as engaged in improving their product, or wait out for the handful who choose to spend capital improving the product and not the ad campagin.  Now of course I know that one can't generalize like my example above does. And that peoples make up of marketing vs. product is not near as binary as I tried to illustrate above, or that one is even better than the other. But I believe a dichotemy exists to some degree, and that the side I find myself identifying with and pouring my energy into can get a bit lonely at times.  How this all translates to anyting concrete about how I go about my life in the next few months, i have no idea. But again like with most everything else I have written about in journals, or on this blog... the medium of text provides the ability to think things through and put them in a concrete form and process that you can look at and evaluate in a different way than just musing about it in you head.  Anyway enough of that for now, since no body likes me and everybody hates me I guess I'll go munch on some worms. ;-)  Nite,  Mule

       The only thing around is fog. Dense, dark, deafening fog. Its so thick that even the seagulls can't find the call of a mate from three feet away. It seems that times like these should be metaphor for something more substantial, but when the veil is lifted all there is left is perfect clarity. No room for ambiguity, no room for interpretation, just the truth. When the truth is revealed how can you argue with the process that got you there?  I'm not sure what it is that motivates us to do what we do but i think you get in trouble when you resist what it is your drawn to. Evil isn't manifested in the action, it's manifested in the repression. No one can spend a lifetime being something other than what they are 100% of the time. With that said who do you become when everything that you are changes and 100% of who you are is nothing that you want to become. Who's going to follow you down that road? Who will be there when you get back.  When standing at a fork in the road how much can one man spend by going down the same way, over and over again. How does he gather the courage to face the untaxed road he knows nothing about. You never know i guess but as long as you have fun walking who cares where you end up.  -anonymous-   So the beach trip was fun! I have amazing friends, who are incredibly funny, tollerant beyond measure, and good to the last drop. All but about 3 hours of the whole trip were absoutly perfect and i hope we can all do it again soon! Oh and just a mental note i need a new tent, sleeping bag, and pillow. Ha Ha Ha.....

       It's a wierd point of view for me to try to wrap my head around, that people out there don't believe in a "Universal Truth" if you will.  I've spent a huge amount of in the past couple of years, reading and comparing notes, and accounts of the role of spirituality in the lives of "The Greats", the people who were considered by history to be enlightened in some area.  As I move through this process, and analyze it from a myriad of different viewpoints, and sources, I begin to see patterns, and fundamental beliefs that begin to emerge.  These things emerge regardless of religious doctrine/dogma, social orientation, sexual orientation, and even period culture.  They just seem to be the things that are "true" regardless.    I have gradually seen my attention shift from discovery, to implementation over the past few months.  How does this all apply to me, now, in my culture, in my social setting, etc.  How do the actions that I take in response to what I believe to be true look?  I don't know, but that's where I'm at right now, is trying to make sense of that.    I refuse to believe that who I am and what I believe in is dictated by the culture around me, and the circumstances I find myself in, and it seems odd to me that anyone would feel comfortable giving up power of their life to something as fickle as the group of people, and the society they find themselves a part of.  To recognize that society is constantly trying to influence you one way or another, and by default is not a revealer or spreader of truth, and in the same breath profess that society, culture, and circumstances are the things that make you who you are.  That just seems  crazy to me.    This all might not make much sense out of context but it stems from conversations i've had over the past several months about whether or not there is a common spiritual link in humanity, a core universal truth or belief structure that trancends time, and culture, and influences humanity.  Or is what I think and believe just a product of the times I live in, end of story.    Yeah, Yeah, I know, it's all really abstract, and sort of wishy washy.  Maybe It'll get boiled down to something concrete one day.  Maybe not.   Later,  Mule

       So last night was about as good as it gets in my book.  Good friends, good conversation, good food, good drink!  I went downtown with Alisa and Peto, and had a splendid time.  I learn something new about friends everyday... I would love to go into the stuff we talked about but with out ten pages of context, I don't really think it would make much sense.  The one thing I do know is that several of the little clicks that I run with (some who know eachother, and some who don't) tend to be pretty set in thier beliefs and are pretty quick to make assumptions about other friends of mine without being open to where everyone is coming from.  Not that it is mandate that everyone agree, or be right or wrong, it's just that different people do things based on what they truly believe inside is right, and it may appear completly fake, or downright dastardly without the context of someone's beliefs.    Again i'm not saying that because someone believes something with all their heart that their actions can be justified as right (I.E. Hitler) but I think I would rather approach someone with a level of patience for the actions that bother me, because I don't have their context in the situation.  I think this opens up the door to growth and understanding for everyone.  No matter the action, if it's done with integrity of one's core belief structure, that is at least one more core value being excersized than in most people these days.    Anyway, it was an awesome night and I can't ever begin to express how valuable I find it to have people who are willing to open up and share things, however small, with me.  If anyone feels like referencing my beach post you'll see why I find it a pretty important part of some relationships to drink together.  I don't care what anyone says, people say things they ordinarily wouldn't after drinking for a bit, and with some exceptions, it's usually feelings that they repress, or truth they otherwise wouldn't admit.  I know that there are people who will disagree with me here, and will believe that i'm twisting things here.  When truth is revealed, I find it hard to argue with the process that got you there.  I think in this case if not stewarded well this process can lead to lots of VERY damaging side effects.  For the most part though it seems to be a very effective way to get the ball rolling for future bonding, and intimacy.    So in conclusion I will conclude!
