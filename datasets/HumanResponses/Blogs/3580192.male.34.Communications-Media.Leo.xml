      For those of you who are dependent on cars, here are some to consider.  (Click link below.)  Before buying anything though, read "Suburban Nation," and give a copy to your friends. :)

      One of my favorite quotes (which I've turned into an email signature) is the following passage from Tom Robbins'  urlLink Another Roadside Attraction ...   "You risked your life, but what else have you ever risked?  Have you ever risked disapproval?  Have you ever risked economic security?  Have you ever risked a belief?  I see nothing particularly courageous in risking one's life.  So you lose it, you go to your hero's heaven and everything is milk and honey 'til the end of time.  Right?  You get your reward and suffer no earthly consequences.  That's not courage.  Real courage is risking something you have to keep on living with, real courage is risking something that might force you to rethink your thoughts and suffer change and stretch consciousness. Real courage is risking one's cliches."  I'm thinking of that quote more and more as I read the latest book for our book club:  urlLink Straw Dogs  by John Gray.      The subtitle of the book, "Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals," should give you a clue as to its thesis... that humans are no more privileged than other species, that belief in human progress is mere fantasy. It's infuriating as it is enlightening to read.  You'll have to steel yourself against his pessimism/nihilism if you want to get through this book.  But it's worth the slog... IF you care to test your beliefs and assumptions.  I'll report back after our book club discussion on Sunday.

      I had a chance to tour Semester at Sea's new ship today.  Only two years old, it's beautiful (inside) and plush... almost too much so for an academic program like SAS.  Maybe it's just me, but I think the old ship, S.S. Universe Explorer, looked better.  It definitely had more character.      For more pictures, click here...  urlLink SAS A04

      At the Vancouver Public Library, UBC grad student Sean Somers gave a lecture on Ulysses in which he gave an insightful explanation of the premise of the book.  He quoted this passage from the very end of Plato's Republic, the part where people were choosing their next reincarnation.  The last person to choose was Odysseus...   "There came also the soul of Odysseus having yet to make a choice, and his lot happened to be the last of them all. Now the recollection of former tolls had disenchanted him of ambition, and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares; he had some difficulty in finding this, which was lying about and had been neglected by everybody else; and when he saw it, he said that he would have done the same had his lot been first instead of last, and that he was delighted to have it."  urlLink The Internet Classics Archive | The Republic by Plato   Odysseus chose to be an ordinary man, so ordinary that everyone neglects him.  In this light, Joyce's Leopold Bloom could be seen as the modern reincarnation of Odysseus, the person the ancient hero wanted to be in his next life.  If you read Ulysses, you'll realize that Bloom, though common, is nonetheless heroic in the deepest way a (modern) man can be.

      This is the start of my personal blog.  It's named after a chapter in Ulysses by James Joyce.  This is the centennial of Bloomsday, after all.

       urlLink Freecycle   Just discovered this service recently whereby you offer stuff for free to people in your town, and you also get to ask for stuff (for free).  It's basically a mailing list but one of the most useful ones around.  There should be one in your city.  Check it out.  The worldwide (!) Freecycle Network is made up of many individual groups across the globe. It's a grassroots movement of people who are giving (& getting) stuff for free in their own towns. Each local group is run by a local volunteer moderator (them's good people). Membership is free.

      When will Americans ever learn?  Higher taxes will not solve congestion problems.  Nor will new/improved roads.  A "511" traffic hotline is nothing but a band-aid.  The answer lies in "traditional neighborhoods."    urlLink CNN.com - Poll: Cut traffic, even if it means higher taxes - Jul 1, 2004 : "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are so frustrated by traffic that more than half say they would be willing to pay higher taxes if it really would improve things.  For now, people are changing routes and schedules, but not getting out of their cars. Only about one in 20 uses mass transit, an Associated Press poll found."  Again, my advice is to read " urlLink Suburban Nation ."

      It's easy to dismiss right wing critics of Fahrenheit 9/11 but they're not the only ones complaining.  Check out Christopher Hitchens' take on the documentary.  I always think he has good points to make whether you draw the same conclusions or not.   "Fahrenheit 9/11 is a sinister exercise in moral frivolity, crudely disguised as an exercise in seriousness. It is also a spectacle of abject political cowardice masking itself as a demonstration of 'dissenting' bravery."  urlLink Unfairenheit 9/11 - The lies of Michael Moore.
