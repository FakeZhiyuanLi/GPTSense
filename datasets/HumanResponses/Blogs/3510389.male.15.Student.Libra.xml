N what the heck is goin on? iono but this liddo dandy Newsletter tells it all=)  First off yay for Nicole Schneegas for writing an excellent article for the newletter =D Why go and try to find a newletter just to read it? Why HERE IT IS!=P  ===> By Nicole Schneegas; Loara KC            Katella, Savanna, and Loara Key Clubs came together one morning on May 22 to help children at the Anaheim Children's Arts Festival show their creativity and imagination.  Arriving at 8:30 AM was no problem for the dedicated volunteers.  Smiling faces as we helped children with origami and the satisfaction of watching the children enjoy themselves made it all worth it.. With all the booths lined up and the air full of excitement, the street looked like a market place, bustling and electrifying, with all of the volunteers manned at a boot, ready for anything.  We got to be children again and time well spent.  This annual event is awesome, so watch out for it next year!  Unfortunatey Loara failed to be top five clubs that rocked the house this month.  Loara was placed at 6th rite under the last club that is printed in the Top 5 =(  Comon Loara what happened we can make the Top 5 at least!! Lets set a goal to reach at least 3rd yes? i kno u can do it!  Well now whats coming up ? juss what's coming up for the div.?   June 3rd is Pat and Oscars Night at Buena Park Mall where anytime between 5 and 8 PM 20% of all proceeds will be donated to Key Club when you present a flyer(which I have) at the time of the order!  June 5th-6th from 11AM-2PM at the Village Mall aka Mall of Orange there will be a "C.O.P.S. EXPO 2004: Kids Print Booth" Where we help out at booths to take photographs and fingerprints of children in attendance.
