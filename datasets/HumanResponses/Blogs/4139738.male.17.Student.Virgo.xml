       Everyone who has been brain washed by the right's attacks of John Kerry as being a "flip-flopper" on the war, should read this wonderful Buzzflash article. Every liberal pissed at Kerry, claiming he's a war monger, or believe he would've also gone to war with Iraq, if president, should read it as well.  urlLink     urlLink What Did the Joint Resolution on Iraq Really Say?

      Recently, the california supreme court nullified all the gay marriages in San Fransico because they supposedly contradicted the state's consitution.  However, under the first two clauses of the 14th amendment, people must not be deprived of their liberties without due process and are subject to equal protection of the law.  This means someone could get married to another of the same sex in Massachusetts and come to, say, Ohio, and declare their marriage legal.  This would be frigging revolutionary and I don't understand why someone hasn't done anything about it yet.  I looked it up in the massachusetts marriage laws, and a minor can be married with the consent of the parents.  Anybody want to go to Massachusetts and get married to one another?

       Go here   for an essay Kurt Vonnegut wrote about recent goings on in the country and the world. Truly magnificent, as he always is.    Moveon.Org just recently came out with these ads of real Americans talking about why they're voting for John Kerry. What's surprising is that the majority of the people in these ads are Republicans, which proves that George W. Bush is a divider, not a uniter. I mean, he even alienates people in his own party. What a guy.  Watch the ads  urlLink here.

      I got about 80 some people called today (all in Bay Village!) and found two big Kerry supporters, Anita Guerin being one of them (a friend's mom). This time, Robert Grossman, Dave Rogers, Ali Tramba, Erin Looshel, David Antone, and Jenny Evans came along. Sometimes all the lines were busy and we had to wait for one or the other to get off. Having more people exponentially increases your chance of hearing funny stories--Rob had over 4 people talk about their miscellaneous injuries and maladies with him, David called someone named Myrlin (who we wanted to ask to put a hex on GW), and I got ahold of someone who was "on the road." David and I noticed how anyone who supports Bush always says " BUSH ." so definitively and defensively. The ones who say "Kerry" pause a little and seem like they're really thinking. I called someone who didn't register because she believed that all the canditates were the same. Anyone who says that is terribly uninformed. Yeah, Dems and Republicans alike do cater to big business, and there are some irksome similiarities, but get your head out of your politically aloof ass. Kerry has the 11th most liberal rating in the senate. He's great at speaking, actually knows what he's talking about, and has a plan to get the country out of the gutter into which it's climbed and prepared to die.  Saying "they're all the same" is just an excuse for you to be apathetic.  I saw this in someones profile: "I hate it when all these people aren't voting because they say that it'd be just picking the lesser of the two evils. For god's sake, pick the lesser!" (don't remember who it was from though). I don't think Kerry is really an anti-Bush ticket. He's got a good plan for a) getting our troops home while simultaneously balancing Iraq's turbulent government b) dragging our sick, oil-sucking economy out of the depths of defecit c) getting our civil liberties back and "ending the age of Ashcroft" d) backing up our ailing schools. I think he's harping too much on his Vietnam service, but we're not getting on Bush's case enough.  There's a huge difference between dodging the service because you disagree with war and dodging the service because you're a coke-blowing pussy . Oh, and that shit about Swift Boat Veterans for Truth--all lies. Check out  urlLink www.spinsanity.org  where you'll see the downlow (the headline is Spinning Swiftly, date 8/9). David and I are going to volunteer at the Festival of the Assumption and pass out literature. I expect we'll have lots of supporters, but some who will go on about Kerry's Pro-Choiceness. Hello people: Bush.  IS.    NOT.      PRO-LIFE  .  Think of all the people that man has put  TO DEATH  as governer of Texas. Think of all of the innocent Afghanis, Iraqis ( who are now in the 10-13 thousand range   urlLink www.iraqbodycount.net ) and not to mention our own soldiers. How can you call him a Pro-Life president? It's a non-issue, throw it out, don't let it decide your vote. Besides, it's absolutely ridiculous to hinge your vote on something like that. If you want, you can be pro-life UNDER KERRY who has all the benefits of being A MUCH BETTER CANDITATE THAN BUSH. And must we go spiralling into this debate?  Pro-Choice does NOT mean pro-abortion . Kerry just doesn't want to force his religious beliefs on others. And you know what? Sagging economies means less money to raise children which means the numbers of people having sex goes down...PFFF--WRONG. The number of abortions should go up. (I'm hypothesizing here, don't take this for absolute fact.) Who do you want at the helm? Someone who's "Pro-Life" and is responsible for terrible economic plight, or someone who's Pro-Choice and pulls us up to a position where people won't want abortions. Huff. Well, to end on a good note, here's a clip of GW getting totally owned at the Unity Conference (collection of all minority journalists who asked the President and Kerry questions, each of whom had different days. George got 5 rounds of applause including the ones where he got on and off stage. Kerry had 20 some--am I right David?).  urlLink http://poststuff2.entensity.net/081204/media.php?media=bush.wmv   ____________________________________________________________________  From Davy:    Yeah calling is a sinch and all, but man....all I have to say  is that the majority of the elderly people in Bay Village are a  CRANKY  bunch to say the least. Just because you're old and senile doesn't mean you have to moan and fart at me for volunteering to help make the country a better place for me AND you (some of you just fail to realize that yet). Other than that, the calling went fine. Called 100 people and I had more Kerry supporters this time which is surprising for Bay Village. Thanks to Steve for that link to the Bush vid. I watched all that live on C-SPAN and I've been waiting ever since for a clip of that ramble. Mark, from what I remember, Kerry got about 40 rounds of applause. Bush got AT MOST 10. Don't forget that half-way through Bush's speech a man stood up and started yelling at Bush in protest(thanks to C-SPAN for showing the dude). After about....say 5 seconds, the man was swarmed by the secret service and escorted out of the building (hopefully not detained indefinitely as an ENEMY COMBATANT). Let's just say that the UNITY Conference was just a sweet sneak preview for the debates in October.     'Bring it on!', George. Give em' hell, John!  Myrlin casts Lvl. 5 Hex Spell on GW! ROLL D20!  2nd post by David Edward Antone

       This past Monday, as Mark said, we went to the John Kerry phone bank and it was a Grand Ol' Time. I had a couple very kind Kerry supporters, and a few very kind people who had to tell me the person i was calling wasn't home (such as one person who's son that i was calling was off training in the military). The majority of the people I called were extremely old and most of the people I called were Bush supporters. Mark and I were stuck calling all South Euclid residents. According to the woman at the phone bank, that's a fairly conservative city. We're going again tomorrow with our teacher Mr. Grossman tomorrow (Thursday). Should be fun with more people  .      Now, on to voting third party. Anyone planning on voting for a third party candidate for President, I beg of you...please don't. I'm begging you because I know for a fact that most of you have good intentions, but I strongly believe that you are unknowingly turning a blind eye to the well-being of the country and the world. This especially applies if you are voting in the crucial battleground states such as my home state of Ohio. I understand that you are upset of the dominance of the two-party system but if we all don't do something now, the Republican Party will become extremely close to making the United States of America a ONE-PARTY STATE. The Republican Party currently controls ALL THREE branches of the US government. This dominance will continue to flourish if George W. Bush is re-elected, especially in the crucial judicial branch (due to Bush's possible future judicial appointments).    We cannot sit idly while this happens because this ain't yo' daddy's Republican party! The Neo-Conservative movement continues to grow within the Grand Ol' Party with their desire to limit or even destroy certain civil liberties, cater to special interests more than ever, and conduct an arrogant, prejudicial,and unilateral foreign policy. Clearly, electing a Democrat to the highest office in the land would put a stop to this neo-conservative movement to overthrow of the US government, preventing an government-wide infestation of Ashcroft-esque politicians.   My point is that THIS ELECTION IS  NOT  THE TIME TO SPLIT THE LIBERAL VOTE AND GIVE GEORGE W. BUSH AND HIS ADMINISTRATION MORE CHANCE OF BEING RE-ELECTED, ALLOWING FURTHER NEO-CONSERVATIVE TAKEOVER GIVING LIBERALS LITTLE OR NO VOICE IN THE UNITED STATES. So if you love this country and if you love this planet, don't vote for George W. Bush or put your reservations aside for this election, and don't vote for Ralph Nader or any 3rd party candidate.Vote for John F. Kerry. Don't split the vote, please.

      David and I went to the Kerry Phonebank in Rocky River yesterday for two and a half hours.  It went by very fast--we called over 100 people and asked them who they wanted to vote for this election.  If they said Kerry, we would ask them if they could help out the campaign in any way possible.  Out of 100 people I got 3 Kerry supporters, 4-5 Bush, and one Nader.  All the rest either didn't answer or hung up.  I was a little nervous at first, making cold-calls, but after a while, it got easy (especially since most didn't answer their phones).  David and I had some funny encounters mostly involving either really old people or really hardcore Republicans (David's are funnier though--I'll let him post the highlights).  One time, in weariness, my fingers fumbled and I accidentally called 911.  Good thing you have to dial 9 to get out, or else that call would have registered.  I did it a second time, but this time, I had already entered the area code too, and it started ringing!  I hope dispatch knows the only emergency we'll have is a case of over-flipping out when Kerry wins.  The time, surprisingly, went by very quickly.  I calculated that we pressed over 1,500 buttons.  Even though we got a lot more Repugnicans than Dems or Indies, when a lady working there saw that we were calling South Euclid, she rolled her eyes and said, "Oh  yeah ."  We wanted to call up our friend Kyle who is (in our humble opinion)   w  a  s  t  i  n  g     his vote on the Green Party, but we forgot his number.  Speaking of third parties and wasted votes: IF YOU ARE LIBERAL, THERE IS NO LOGICAL REASON IN THE ENTIRE WORLD THAT YOU SHOULD BE VOTING FOR ANYONE BUT JOHN KERRY.  People who want to vote Green seem to forget that Kerry has a 95% on environmental issues.  A 60% is considered great.  Considering that there are no real conservative third parties (unless you count Nader, who gets most of his support from Republicans who...guess what!...want him to take votes away from Kerry), it's a fractured base against one other party.  No one cares about your "principles" in this election, possibly the most important election of our lives.  Getting the 5% for next election won't matter when, by then, our country is  FUBAR .   What Green and third parties need to do is not go straight for the President, but build up a base in lower positions, congressional or local, so that when the time comes for them to run for president, they actually have a base of voters that has a chance of getting them elected, not just for this mythical Holy Grail of 5%.     What are they going to do with the Federal funding they get if THEY DON'T HAVE A LEGACY OTHER THAN 8 YEARS OF BUSH?  No matter what anyone tells you, third parties  do not work in an electorial college .  People cite third parties as being responsible for the demise of slavery, leaps and bounds for labor, and other special interests, but guess what!   THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ELECTED THEMSELVES   (other than Teddy Roosevelt, who ran on and Independent platform that was exactly the same as the Republican one).  The best they can hope for is one of the larger parties absorbing their platform.  And considering that John Kerry has a NINTY FIVE PERCENT on environmental issues, I would judge the Green Party effectively absorbed (with, ironically, only 5% left to them).  We need to a) not vote third party, even in non-swing states.  Contributing to the popular vote count is as important as tipping the vote in swing states; b) get as many people voting as possible.  The more people we get to vote, especially in the 18-24 age group, the inevitable result is more Kerry supporters.  If Bush wins this election, it's not because a majority of Americans want him to be president, but because a majority of Americans didn't make it to the polls.  You know who really stole the election in Florida?  It wasn't just Bush.  It was third parties.  Six hundred plus votes went to Socialist or Communist parties.  Hey, at heart, I may be with them, but WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?  The last person that liberal that was almost elected was Eugene V. Debs, and that was during a labor crisis so bad that becoming a Pinkteron was the best career move you could make (considering everyone but them was getting their shit kicked).  The Florida election was so close that if those liberals had voted for Gore, it would have likely tipped the election beyond Bush's stacked Supreme Court's fanagling.    A vote for a third party is a vote for Bush.  There is no way around it.

      Bugger people who say, "I don't know Kerry's position because he flip-flops daily!"  This is a facsimile phrase pumped out by Fox and other Bushites.  Ask anyone about his "flip-flops" and they can't back up jack shit.  "He voted for the war" well yeah, that was before anyone knew that the president LIED about the WMDs.  Many of these "flip-flops" posted on Bush's reelection site span 10-20+ years.  Four years ago, I used to think Will Smith was a great musician, but I don't now, and no one's calling me a flip-flopper.  And have people forgotten that changing your mind is OK?  Hello?  Yes.  Changing your mind...is OK.  What do we want in office?  A guy who's bullheaded and never goes back on what he says or someone who can admit when he's wrong (and been wronged).  Anyone who talks about Kerry's Flip-Flopping has no idea what they're talking about because there is, in fact, nothing to talk about.  What about Bush "flip-flopping" on No Child Left Behind--a program he praised but left terribly underfunded.  What about Bush applauding veterans, then cutting their benefits?  What about Bush flip-flopping off his bike...twice!  There isn't a band-aid big enough to cover up Bush's scabbed political career.

      Everyone needs to read "Against All Enemies" by Richard Clarke.  It's really funny at times (Colin Powell calls chemical weapons "goofy") and really creepy at others (all the holes that still exist in our current infrastructure) and sometimes just makes you pissed off too (if we would have continued Gulf War 1 for another 72 hours and destroyed the Republican Guard, the Shi'ites would have sucessfully risen up and unseated Saddam...instead, they were brutally slaughtered by the R.G. when they rose up--why didn't we help?  We didn't want another Shi'ite government like Iran...).  Clarke also delves into why so many people in the Mideast hate America, drawing on history he experienced firsthand over his 20+ years of service in counterterrorism within the White House.  This guy got so fed up with Bush's fanagling in Iraq that he up and quit.  Very well written and very engaging.  One of the most informative books you'll ever read.

       Read this truly   urlLink  awesome essay    by Ron Reagan on the Bush administration and the realization of the American public of this administration's lack of credibility, common sense, and compassion...    "As Bush's former Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, and his onetime "terror czar," Richard A. Clarke, have made clear, the president, with the enthusiastic encouragement of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz, was contemplating action against Iraq from day one. "From the start, we were building the case against Hussein and looking at how we could take him out," O'Neill said. All they needed was an excuse. Clarke got the same impression from within the White House. Afghanistan had to be dealt with first; that's where the actual perpetrators were, after all. But the Taliban was a mere appetizer; Saddam was the entrée. (Or who knows? The soup course?) It was simply a matter of convincing the American public (and our representatives) that war was justified. The real—but elusive—prime mover behind the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden, was quickly relegated to a back burner (a staff member at Fox News—the cable-TV outlet of the Bush White House—told me a year ago that mere mention of bin Laden's name was forbidden within the company, lest we be reminded that the actual bad guy remained at large) while Saddam's Iraq became International Enemy Number One. Just like that, a country whose economy had been reduced to shambles by international sanctions, whose military was less than half the size it had been when the U. S. Army rolled over it during the first Gulf war, that had extensive no-flight zones imposed on it in the north and south as well as constant aerial and satellite surveillance, and whose lethal weapons and capacity to produce such weapons had been destroyed or seriously degraded by UN inspection teams became, in Mr. Bush's words, "a threat of unique urgency" to the most powerful nation on earth."       Oh, yesterday I received a recruitment letter from the vast right-wing conspiracy. More on that tomorrow...

       3 days ago, the secretary of Homeland Security. Tom Reluctant-Neo-Con Ridge , announced a raise in the terror threat level from lemon to clementine (right?) citing specific information, from multiple sources that New York and New Jersey financial centers were the target of Al Qaeda terrorists that are possibly currently in the United States,(probably watching 'America-hater'   Michael Moore's movies and partying with 'god-hater' George Soros at this very moment.)       Although he says Wall St. is about to E*X*P*L*O*D*E! Sec. Ridge repeats his post-threat announcing mantra of "Go on with your daily lives normally!". Which in    B u s h' s  A m e r i c a   consists of using what little money you have left (after losing your manufacturing job to outsourcing) to buy a $14 throw pillow at Wall*Mart (aiding in the eradication of small business) along with some Duck Brand duct tape to save yourself from biological attack(following Homeland Security's post-9/11 advice. Without knowing that Avon, Ohio-based Duck Brand duct tape makes up 46 percent of the nations duct tape supply.Is it coincidence that the Duck Brand is owned by a man named Jack Kahl, a Bush campaign contributor who gave over $100,000 to Bush's 2000 campaign?). As you exit the Wall*Mart and walk to your $2 per-10-miles SUV, you take a deep breath of de-regulated air and look into the pale blue sky. As you look into that sky you thank God that George Bush proposed the "Clear Skies Initiative", which can finally make the skies clear...of birds. You arrive at your apartment and read the last few e-mails of the day and any feeling of loneliness melts away because you know that your Big Brother Ashcroft was reading those e-mails too. Ah, Bush's America!    YEAH! TAKE THAT OSAMA!  T H E S E  C O L O R S DON'T RUN! THEY CLIMB...THE CORPORATE LADDER!                   Soooo anyways, here are some interesting links pertaining to the recent terror-threats...      This  urlLink New Republic article  that was issued more than  two weeks  before the terror threat was announced discusses the Bush Administration urging Pakistan to capture Al Qaeda related high-value-targets (HVTs) such as Osama Bin Laden BEFORE the November election. Here's an excerpt-              "But The New Republic has learned that Pakistani security officials have been told they must produce HVTs by the election. According to one source in Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), "The Pakistani government is really desperate and wants to flush out bin Laden and his associates after the latest pressures from the U.S. administration to deliver before the [upcoming] U.S. elections." Introducing target dates for Al Qaeda captures is a new twist in U.S.-Pakistani counterterrorism relations--according to a recently departed intelligence official, "no timetable[s]" were discussed in 2002 or 2003--but the November election is apparently bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt. Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, explains, "The Musharraf government has a history of rescuing the Bush administration. They now want Musharraf to bail them out when they are facing hard times in the coming elections."           It wasn't until this threat that the mainstream media has questioned whether the Bush Administration has used terror threats for political gain. It's strange how almost every time something goes against the favor of the Bush Administration, they soon announce a raise in threat level from  jungle green  to  fuschia , or from  midnight blue  to the dreaded  macaroni n' cheese ( terror threat levels obviously monopolized by Crayola). The controversial shady terrorist threats are what comedian David Cross sarcastically refers to as "A FUCKING COINCIDENCE!".  Here's New York Times  urlLink editorial piece  on how Homeland Security Sec. Ridge's recent terror announcement at times felt less like a counterterrorism announcement and more like a counter-convention announcement.     "Some of the past terror alerts have seemed aimless and happened when the Bush administration would have benefited from a change in the political conversation. On Sunday, when the administration had grim and specific information to convey, Mr. Ridge did a real disservice to himself, his president and the public by giving what amounted to a campaign pitch for "the president's leadership in the war against terror.'' It's hard to write that off as an offhand comment. If Mr. Ridge is to continue in this role, he must stay out of the election; using him as a campaign surrogate would be disastrous for public confidence. The administration should also stop dropping dark hints about Al Qaeda's having election-related motives to attack, as if a vote against the current president were appeasement."   Hm, what could be against Georgie's favor this time? Hmmm, maybe THE ELECTION ON Nov. 2 WHICH HE WILL MOST LIKELY LOSE! Bush MUST GO!

       Hello. My name is David Antone, I live in the Cleveland suburb of Bay Village, Ohio and I am currently 17 years old. I attend Bay High School and will be a senior this fall. I recently decided to dedicate myself, for the next ninety days to helping elect Democratic Nominees John Kerry and John Edwards as President and Vice President of the United States and Eric Fingerhut as Ohio U.S. Senator. I have started this blog as an internet base for the Young Democrats Club that I plan to start with some of my friends at my school. I will be posting various articles and information pertaining to the election and the shameful and dangerous monstrosity that is the Bush administration. I will also post info on various volunteer opportunities around the Cleveland area to help register and educate voters, attend rallies or protests, etc. This may be the most important election in our lives. We all must unite, and practice our civic duty of voting to elect John Kerry to prevent another 4 years of the neo-conservative, special interest tailoring, and arrogant Bush administration.      ANY AND ALL HELP IS WELCOME!      If you wish to...     Contribute an article, some information,give suggestions or anything to this blog    Join the Bay High Young Democrats  OR     Request any help from me     CONTACT ME:     via  E-Mail: urlLink seamlessline@yahoo.com       OR post a comment on this blog.
