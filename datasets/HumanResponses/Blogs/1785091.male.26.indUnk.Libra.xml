      Orc is now talking. Or is Orc typing? Orc is confused.   Orc is now a Melbourne Orc. Orc used to be a Singaporean Orc. But Singaporeans give Orcs a bad name. So Orc is left. Orc is now a down-under grog swilling, always freezing, sun-loving Orc. Orc is lazy. But Orc is very original. Some hate Orc, others want things from Orc. Orc is musical, and has bad taste in Orc-grrls.

      Dusted Days 1  (Somewhere in 1996)  It's basic military training time. I'm pretty much bald, in a bad mood and bald. Did I mention I was bald? Army is certainly an experience. To say it isn't would be lying. In some ways, I guess the guys you meet it BMT dont truly ever fade from your mind. There is always something, some memory that brings you back or ties you to them. Going through sh** does that to people I guess.  It's nightime. We are at the most 2 weeks away from our passing out parade. I'm lying in my bunk and those ceiling fan's are blowing warm air at full blast. The crickets are in full sing and it's come to the point where it's late enough that almost everyone is quiet. The corridor lights blinked off about 15 mins ago and here I am, lying on my bunk, with my grey PT shirt on and those ridiculous ill fitting black shorts...Man I hated those shorts. (Camel Toe City).   I'm itching. Lips really itching for a smoke. I'm getting to that nervous, foot tapping tension that comes with the anticipation of a cigarette. But I can't. I'd get busted, I could smoke in the balcony, but that would be too risky. So I just bite my tongue and rest one foot on the locker to my left and one to my right, like some weird horizontal Yul Brynner character.  It really sucks to be in camp on a Saturday. Some of the guys were really itching to go out. IT would have been fun, like the time we went to Boom Boom Room or the the other times when we just meet up in Boat Quay and get absolutely hammered on our lousy shit recruit pay.   I get more and more angry when I think about it. We were doing parade drills in preparation of POP and this absolute useless fuck (you know the sort, there's one in every platoon. He will guarantee a f-up in almost anything that requires being done as a platoon). In the Army, especially, don't count on luck, because you wont have it. The RSM sees our performance based on the dick's performance, and decides we are in no shape to have the weekend off, so our weekend is scratched. No booze, No smokes, No wild hoping  for getting laid in random encounters. The platoon is pissed.  "Psskt Oi, Saw. Time liao." I turn my head to the balcony. There they are, bald fuzzy heads semi gleaming in the moonlight like malevolent peaches with evil grins. I turn to wake some of my bunkmates but some of them are already up, probably drifting in and out of sleep, probably just as angry as I am to get any sleep.   I creep up off the bed and as I do so a half dozen or so guys in my section do so too. We inch as quietly as we can. I unlock my locker and search around in the dark for my webbing. I open the poncho pocket and take out a small piece of wood. A broken part of a longer broom handle.  We creep out slowly and inch into the next section to our left. There people are almost all up.The malay guys are talking softly and looking out the windows. One of them, the more pious and righteous one in the group is saying "Don't do this. This is not right.". We all grunt and tell him to piss off and that if he doesn't like it he should just go to bed and put the pillow on his face and shut the hell up.  There he is. The prodigy. The savant. The force majeuere. In all his asinine, semi- retarded glory. This one I remember seeing on the first day at intake. He didnt come on the bus. His mom had dropped him off. It was clear from the onset that he was "special". But he wasn't "Forrest Gump" or "I am Sam" special, where you could just hold him and have this big heart to wanting to help the guy out for his shortcomings and be his  best friend. This guy was the sick retarded shit who looked at people's dicks while they showered and gave them lewd looks. This was the guy who touched people's bums and when asked why had no answer. This was the guy who turned good nice honest recruits into vile, vengeance seeking firebrands of fury. Had his shortcomings not gotten us in trouble over and over again, maybe we could have just let him be. But it hadn't. It was always him, over and over again. But for me, I was never a perfect human being at the start so I don't need any justification for the actions.   1 Second - They pulled the blanket over his body on all four sides 2 second - I place my hand with a pillow over his face area to muffle him. 3 second - We start bashing him.   It's like an attack of the Nazgul. Swift, silent, and brutal. I can hear him screaming underneath the pillow and crying as we beat him repeatedly, there are so many of us almost twenty, all around the bed. Some are Ah Bengs. They stomp him with their feet and mutter time honoured Hokkien curses. Some like me have weapons. I club this motherfucker with all the strength I can muster, his screaming and yelping under the pillow urging me  on more my blood pumping through my forehead...hot and angry. I am part of the English speakers, the "Ang Mor pai". But it's fine. The Army is like a pack of dogs. as long as  you aren't the runt or the bitch, you are in the pack.  The beating goes on for about 40 secs. The sound is astounding. A almost constant flurry of thuds. But it's funny. So many of us want to beat the fella that we are standing toe to toe, occasionally two people side by side swing together and end up hitting each other. Wrist cracks are pretty common. Above the crying and yelping, there is chuckling. This is surreal. I feel like an animal. Yet I feel liberated. I get so caught up in the bloodlust that I dont realise that most people have stopped. I am the only one left holding the pillow that covers his face. The only thing stopping him from ID-ing me as an attacker. The only one still around. "Hurry Up! Before PC come!" they say, like idiots.  I hear people coming up the stairs. someone had reported this. I have too little time. So little time.   I turn my head away as much as I can and lift the tear soaked pillow as fast as I can. As soon as he sees light I smash my fist as hard as I can into his skinny, greasy pimpled face. And I turn and run, to the safety of my bed.  My heart is beating fast. I'm trying to stay calm, to go to sleep.I feel the light in my face soon after. The sentries are looking for suspects. I can hear the fool crying in the room over. The PC is asking him to go to sleep. The sweat turns cooler after awhile, and I drift off slowly.  I wish I was out having beer rather than this

      Dusted Days 3 (1995)  I had gone for lunch with my parents. I do believe it was a weekend and if I am not wrong the lunch venue was either "Ghim Moh" or "Alexandra Village". I can't remember which for the life of me.   Putting myself psychologically in the context of the story, I was definitely over influenced by the music I was listening to. Nirvana and early Pearl Jam. Very angry music. Very "I'm misunderstood. Rebel yell", kinda stuff.   Plus, those years were pretty much the most powerful years of the Generation X/Grunge/Slacker movement. It seemed that in that generation, a kind of anti-establishment/anti-corporate youth ethos was created. Ironically, so much of the wave that took the Gen X/Seattle scene to the rest of the world required the use and channels of big business and corporate highways.   But I bought it. I bought the whole farm. Bought the "I'm so angry at everything"-schtick. Living in Singapore, I was dissatisfied with many  things, examples,  1) Anger at the pecking order of my school, where I was almost constantly ostracised for being fluent in English where everyone else was fluent in a mother tongue. Between getting beat up, laughed at, shunned and every other kind of peer harrassment, I pretty much gave up on secondary education. There is little incentive to study when you are surrounded by brutes and your mind is preoccupied with not having to get throttled after school.      2) Anger at Singapore. Societal things seemed to irk me. Like the introduction of R(A) films, to the ridiculous bans on films and texts, to the overbearing authoritarianism and self-serving cronyism of those who claimed to be influential and free speakers of "the Arts and Music". That really got my goat. I remember being so angry when copies of Nirvana's In Utero album were sold in the major stores in singapore and "Rape Me" was bleeped out and stuff. Things like that used to really get me into a furore.  3) Anger at my fellow sheep, I mean man. Let's face it. Singaporeans are generally meek when it comes to voicing opinions regarding Government behaviour and legislation. The sadness lies in the fact that the routine and manner in which the Govt has muted public opinion has become one where the public themselves have grown ambivalent to so many issues. Simply because either;   a) They are scared to be vocal,  b) They simply don't care enough to be vocal about it or;  c) They ostracise those who are vocal, hushing them up in a rhetoric of "haiyah, why care? make too much noise go jail. Dont care lah, no big deal"  4) Anger at the cost of living. Singapore is expensive to "Live" in. When I say that I mean, having a life beyond just being able to exist. Having enough to indulge in one or two favourite activities.  So because of these and a few other factors like my Dad getting shafted at work for being a good old "Salt of the Earth" kinda worker instead of the brown-nosing intellectual who is useless in practical situations, and overall dissatisfaction in the quality of my life at that point in time, I said something which must have had some, if not a large bearing on where I am now.  I uttered the words (approximately)  "You know what Dad, and Mom. Why don't we just go. Why don't we just leave Singapore...."  I proceeded to present my argument, quoting my Dad's disappointment with work, presenting the case of me struggling at school with my second anguage, presenting a pretty detailed version of some of the points that I highlighted above. It was one instance when I was not interrupted in my presentation of the case to my folks. I do not even recall any other time when I have not been rebutted, stopped or simply told off for speaking at such length on any subject of serious importance.  Essentially I "character assassinated" Singapore. Using as many fronts as I could from macro to micro issues. Everything from the Social-Authoritarianism to the banning of chewing gum, to the disadvantage of those who were more artistically gifted rather than academic, in a place like Singapore. Singapore the evil PAP machine, Singapore the "You cannot" society. Singapore the stifling, money-making, industrial machine.  "Let's just go, let's just fucking go".  I had hit a nerve I guess, because for the next 8 years, my parents really fought tooth and claw for PR status in Australia. Application after application, tallying of points, seeing agents, medicals, repeated appeals, coping with changes in application policy on the Australian legislative side. A million and one things. Even till 6 months before we got the PR (Finally in 2003), we had no clue whether we were getting it or not. Writing to the minister even (Back when ministers basically "aye" or "nay"-ed visas for applicants)  I will sidetrack abit here.       During this time of course, I had the opportunity of studying in Australia. I was in Perth for about 4 years and then in Melbourne to live with my sister for awhile. It is an experience, studying abroad. I would recommend it to anyone with the means/desire to go.   Then I began to see the flipside of migration.   Being Asian, moving to a Caucasian-heavy country does have it's issues too.   1) It will take a long time before Asians are well and truly regarded as first class citizens or residents of Australia (If that ever happens at all). Never heard a comment about Chinese and Chinese food yet? Come be a minority here, and experience it for yourself.   2) Because of Australia being a country that is supposedly very tolerant on issues, they do not penalise stupidity. It is not a joke. Stupid is rife here. You have social imbeciles and delinquents, spraying any damn public thing with graffiti, trash, slurs. You name it,you got it. People dont respect public property here. There is no fat jail/fine if you spit/pee/litter/vandalise/squat, thus you get public stupidity.  3) Where Singapore is a majority White/upper-blue collar country, Australia has more spread in social strata. And it has a welfare system. So you do have the homeless, drug-addicted, psychotic and simply-no-goods more present in society.  4) Crime. Forget about walking to 7-Eleven for smokes. Opportunities for weird shiet going on are there. Maybe not like New York, but still...  5) A longing for the sights, sounds and tastes of home. They will always be sensual longing for "back home" like food, familar places and such.  So its funny when I am in Singapore and people don't ASK me how Australia is. They TELL me.   "Australia good right? Everything cheap over there, servings very big right? I heard Australia girls very pretty. You like Ang Moh or not? Marry one lah. House cheap, Car cheap. If I go I buy WRX liao ah.." And so on and so forth.  When I am in Australia, this happens, "Food everywhere? Any time of the day or night? Wow! $2.00 for any kind of food? Thats awesome. No crime? No guns? No welfare? No littering? Get anywhere in Singapore in one hour? By public transport? Sentosa? Wow".  And the Australians ask me if I liked it better in Singapore.  Truth is, neither feels like home to me anymore. Having lived in both places in spurts and intervals of 6 months to a year, I have found nothing truly feels like home anymore. You meet people, friends and just when you start to settle, you gotta go ,again and again. College, Uni, Mediacorp, Melbourne, Lycos, Melbourne again.  So do me a favour. Don't ask me which is better. Cause I always say the same thing.  Neither is better, neither is worse, The more I know about the subject, the less I know.  "Everywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home".

      Dusted Days 2 (1989-91)  Ah the wonder years of Chinese torture. Translated from one Mandarin class.  Demon teacher: “ Tianqing, please read the second paragraph of the story out loud for the class ”  Me: “ Very long very long last time, got a crazy…erm, no …small white protrusion, erm I mean rabbit, that climb up a hill. Suddenly, got one piece, no erm, one animal of wolf who is very pervert, no I mean hungry…teacher they are laughing at me. Stop laughing, stop laughing leh. [Hokkien curse word] [Hokkien curse word] ”   Weekdays back then consisted of; A) Ill fitting uniforms, waking at 5.30 in the morning. B) Day of classes and one 20 minute recess of MSG laden food C) Backs drenched in sweat from lugging overweight schoolbags and walking home in the blazing sun (for those poor morning session students).  D) Reaching home in the evening reeking of sweat and fighting hunger pangs (for those poorer afternoon session students ) E) Those dreaded tuition lessons. F) A spot of TV after dinner, then homework. In my case, writing 100 copies of each word I failed in chinese spelling, and another 100 copies of each word I failed in chinese tuition spelling. I had suspected my right forearm being bigger than my left arm in those days. God, I so miss afternoon “coming home from school” naps.  All well and good about the weekdays. But what about the weekends?  My parents used to be avid golfers. In your early teens, if you had parents who golf, you would know that Golf is the most horrible and wretched hobby that can ever be imposed upon your kids.  At that age you are a schoolfool in the weekdays and thats hell enough, but no, weekends are as depressing if not more so.  But on the weekends, your parents don’t just want to golf for fun. They want to golf, period. In fact, they are golf MAD. They don’t just play 18-holes a day. (An average game of 18 holes takes somewhere between 4 to 5 hours, by the way, depending on where you play and how fast you play it) The avid golfer, like my crazy folks, laughs hysterically in glee at the prospect of 36 holes in one day. “Bring it on!”, you can almost hear them cheering, as they pee their pants in overbearing excitement.  So the routine used to be Monday – Friday: School Saturday: Wait at home for Dad to come back from ½ day at work. Mom makes lunch. He has his lunch then the whole family’s off to good old Sembawang Country Club. Parents start a golf flight about 2, finishes about 8, we have dinner and that’s goodbye Saturday.  Sunday: Wake up at 6am. Scolded to hurry up. Whiny moaning from me and my sister. Stuffed into the car by 6.30. Fly to Thomson road. Have a quick breakfast. Fly to Sembawang club. Parents dump us in the clubhouse with bags of homework. They start a flight 7-ish, finishes at about noon. They come back to the clubhouse, we have lunch. Check if homework done. Woe is you if you’ve done none. After lunch, they start another flight about 2 and finish about 8pm. Same routine after that as on Saturday.  Needless to say this routine was very depressing for me as a kid. Forget hanging out with friends, forget television, forget mixing with the boys. Forget suggesting you stay home, because that was the time when “Latch-key” children were all the news in the papers. No self respecting parent would want their  neighbours saying that their children were left home alone from 7am to 9pm and even later. So me and sis never had a choice. We had to go. Week in, week out.  Sembawang Country Club is located inside a military base. As such , there is no place to wander off to. You are stuck there till you leave.  No walking the woods, no exploring.   See the sign? Yeah. “Trespassers will be prosecuted”. I always feel sorry for the white man whose hands are held in the air, in the midst of falling over after being shot in the ass by the black man with the rifle behind him.   It isn’t even a fancy country club, not even in the least. Back in those days I can still tell you what they had.  Bear in mind that many of the buildings for the club were formerly belonging to the NZ Kiwi club, so these were rundown, paint peeling, old colonial period style buildings.    1)There was one old dingy Squash court building, often dead leaves would clutter the gutters and there was kind of a musky smell in the place, because it was hardly used on weekdays if at all, and the lights were always off. Ventilation was also very poor.  Dust everywhere.   2)An outdoor badminton court, which in Singaporean terms means two iron poles sticking out of a concrete floor covered with dead leaves.  3) A children’s playground. Sandboxed area with [1 x See-Saw(broken), and 1 x  Swing]  4)A children’s arcade room (back when games were 20 cents a go)  1x Space Invaders machine and  3 x regular arcade style machines (the brown wooden boxed type).  One of those games would always be Pac-Man. And only stupid people play Pac-Man.  5)An old blue mosaic style swimming pool with accompanying algae ridden yellow PVC style waterslide (They turned the water spouts off on the slide on weekdays) You could use the slide for the pool, but then your skin would mysteriously itch afterwards. The pool was fun occasionally. I remember keenly the numerous occasions when I would dive to the pool’s depths, ignoring my burning eyes to grab at and surface with handfuls of the bountiful treasures that I  had ventured to obtain. Double handfuls of undissolved white chlorine powder. Occasionally, you would see a frog laying belly up in the water. 	  6)The famous Sembawang Country Clubhouse where apparently the drink “Gunner” originated. All it is, is really equal parts of Ginger ale and Ginger Beer a big old beer mug with lots of ice. I remember fondly the people who ran the cafeteria there and their pricing strategy; 	Fries ordered by your parents -$2 	Fries ordered by you for your parents - $2 	Fries ordered by you when your parents weren’t around - $3 (mysteriously 	smaller serve)  7)One TV room. It’s a sand crusted old Telefunken that you have to hit to adjust. Just        Don’t let the club manager see you do this) to get the colours to work. Forget about focus. Just get used to squinting your eyes to blur your vision such that the TV looks clear   8)Jackpot room. Hahahahah. Try getting in there when you are 14. I dare you. “Ah Di ah, Le Buay Sai Jip Ke Chee Tao.. Blah blah tell your parents, caning etc etc..”  So what does this all add up to? Imagine this.  You finish class on a Friday. You come home and rush dinner. 7pm, you rush downstairs for Karate class. Not like you really want to take the class anymore, but your parents don’t believe in quitting anything.  You do flying kicks barefoot on a concrete basketball court for years. This of course, utterly destroys your ankles which never recovers for the rest of your life. In fact you tend to limp if you’ve been on your feet for too long, a testiment to the stupidity of Martial Arts instructors when it comes to podiatrics.   Anyway, you come home utterly wasted at drop dead on the sack at 10.30 or 11.   Next morning you get up. It’s Saturday. Forget Visionaries and Smurfs, you have tuition at 9.45 with a teacher who has two eyes, neither of which look in the actual direction that she looks at. Its like taking class with Sammy Davis Jr, but much much eviler. You don’t actually learn anything because she translates mandarin words for you to mandarin, or hakka, if you prefer. Your mandarin doesn’t really improve, but your pain threshold does.   2 hours later, you are home and you have lunch. Throw everything into a bag because as soon as Dad finishes lunch its off to the club.  Repeat same scenario for Sunday morning except you feel like crying because its 6 in the morning and some cruel god won’t let you sleep. By 7am, you are shivering in the morning cold clubhouse with a belly full of Prata. Your parents are off to Golf and you are in that horrible state where you are so sleepy but yet to awake to sleep. The club chairs chafe your ass and its 2 hours at least before anything resembling Denver the Last Dinosaur or SwatKats comes on the Tele.   You have $3 to last the whole day. Its in case you are hungry. You look into the  horizon and see the sky turn from dark blue to milo brown. The sun is slowly starting to rise. Your sister, who can sleep through a nuclear explosion, is curled up in a little ball, hugging her “cute pillow”, which is a stained, dirty, smelly, drool covered thing that just happens to be her favourite pillow.   So you gaze into the new day which you know is going to be as boring and depressing. Somehow the dewy morning and the chill gets to you so that after the rising sun pierces your eyes, you nod off into a light and restless sleep.   You awake with a start and dash to turn on the TV in the TV room. The TV starts to work properly just in time to catch the closing credits of SwatKats. You stay on the channel a bit longer but its World of Sport with Hamish Brown. No cartoons for you today.   You decide to go for a swim. You are at that weird age where you don’t really qualify as a kid yet you are not an adult either. You think maybe some swimming would be fun. Every other members 8 to 12 year old is doing the little kid thing. You are 15. Misfit central. You change into your swimming trunks. You know, the little boy swimming trunks that show off how really small your balls are. You almost jump into the chlorine caustic trap that is the club’s swimming pool but realise the usually blue pool is now a bright green. You put two and two together and realise that; blue pool + 2 dozen screaming, arm float wearing, incontinent tykes = green “shi shi” pool, not swimming pool.   Ah what the hell…   You throw caution to the wind and dive in head first. You swim around, taking special care not to swallow any water, After soaking for awhile your eyes are burning so bad from the chlorine and your fingertips are wrinkled and turning white at the edges. As a child, you don’t really care but your parents are due back from the first game and it’s eat with them or no lunch at all.   You scramble into the change room and take a quick shower. The management has decided that soap bars and shampoo are too inefficient and have swapped those for Johnson and Johnson baby powder bottles filled with soap powder.   20 minutes late, you are back in the clubhouse with damp hair. You are clean. I mean, really, you are. You are possibly the cleanest person on the face of the earth. Of course your eyes are tearing and burnt from the chlorine and your skin is slightly itchy from the soap powder but for all intensive purposes, people could eat off your ass. You are that clean… Dynamo boy!   You have lunch with your parents, saving the $3 given to you and you pray that you do not succumb to boredom and flush the 3 bucks down the toilet on some half-assed arcade game. At 20 cents that buys you 15 attempts, which is an average of maybe a good part of an hour playing, after which you will drop dead of boredom, or hunger, which you could allay with the $3.  So make you call Dynamo boy… 40 mins of games or 25 hot french fries?  You might think I’m over exaggerating the suffering, but you are wrong. The actual thing was much worse. You see there almost never were people around I could mix with, because most of the kids my age were cool. They either had maids or were staying home alone, ordering pizza or buying their own awesome lunches and stuff.   The afternoon comes and you have either blown your money on games or chips, It doesn’t matter which. You struggle with your homework, resisting the temptation to just rip out the damn answer sheet from behind the assessment books. Remember those things? Those f**king assesment books?  Eventually you finish or give up and you sit by the broken see-saw, looking into the horizon, seeing silhouettes of golfers walking around, doing their golfy things.   It was during this time that I started thinking. There was so much time to kill, so I just thought really big questions. It was kind of a fatalistic tendency. One reason I felt like this was because I had done next to nothing for my weekend and you know that feeling where you just dread Monday because it’s a school day? You get that feeling big time when you do absolutely squat ever weekend in and out.  The most depressing time is just when the sun sets on Sunday evening.   Many of these Sundays had passed  and I had plenty of time to think about some very big questions. Eventually the only question that kept working through my mind as I spent hours staring at sand and ant trails was this…  “What will happen when I die?”.   And I got very frightened. It was something I had so much trouble fathoming.  I remember the terror very vividly. Imagining life, and then imagining not living anymore. Of course back in that time I was afraid because I thought my consciousness would go on while the senses had ceased long before. That’s what I thought Death was. Not being able to see, hear, feel, touch, smell, move or speak but still awake. The worse prison imaginable.  Eventually my existential fear worked itself internally. And I got so scared that eventually one day, while having dinner with my family, I burst out into tears, while having rice with the folks,  Me: “What will happen when I die ???” *crying ensues* Mom: “Siao! Eat your rice and stop talking nonsense. Feel like slapping you. Stupid idiot!” *insert slap here*  Don’t you just love the Asian version of parenthood sometimes?  There would be 2 times out of the zillion times at Sembawang CC that I would truly enjoy and cherish (Well, apart from the Xmas functions which was always amusing in the “National Lampoon’s Family Vacation” sort of way).  Those 2 times were a week apart.   And were the times when I would first come to meet Karin Goh.

      "I know you wanna leave me      but I refuse to let you go     If I have to beg,              and plead for your sympathy    I don't mind, cause            you mean that much to me     "  Many songs can make you think, bob your head and hum a tune incessantly. Of course, most of such songs just become liked because they receive so much airplay and promotion that they embed themselves in your head, rather an unconscious decision rather than actual choice. How many times have you caught yourselves humming some tune that you absolutely hate? It is actually more common than perceived. They are commonplace tunes.  However, every now and then there comes a song that you actually like based on something more. Meaningful lyrics, or a liking for the singer of the song, drives the motivation instead. You can associate the song based on perhaps something in your personal experience that relates to it, or a song that fits in nicely with your personal philosophy. These are songs of your pet musicians, you actively seek out such songs as they help you or rather, you perceive they help to improve the definition of your own self. Very much like the way I perceive myself to be defined by the music of Pearl Jam, STP etc.. It is active participation. And it is the foundation of music fandom.  But there is another even rarer association with the wonderful world of music. The quintessential reward of music and oft the artist's primary objective is to have a song that instantly moves you on a level that transcends both the unconscious and critical mind. You know when you hear such songs, they bring rapture that often brings tears to your eyes, and makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand in pleasure. It's like ear sex, to put it coursely. A song that just illuminates throughout your being. You feel like a better person to have witnessed the performance of such a song and/or singer. One such song could very much be "Superman" by Five for Fighting or the more recently released "100 years". Now you might know what I'm talking about. But even as good as those songs are. I have not witnessed a performance that actually moves me to tears. Not tears of sadness, but rather tears of exultation. A song or performance that "rocks your world", so to speak.  All those who are said to achieve this are oft attributed the "diva" status. You have your Whitneys, Mariahs and Celines, then you have your pretenders like Christinas, Shanias and Faiths. Of course I chose these examples based on what would be commonplace examples of such "Divas". Your personal choices would probaly differ. Sad to say, these prime definitions of singers and artists do nothing for me either. No tears at all. Then you have a little known contest called "American Idol". A tall, dark and goofy individual who has seemingly had the luck to be in the contest at all, having missed out twice and finally qualify for the finals on a wildcard draw, as a result of some other contestant being disqualified. This man is George Huff. And he is simply astounding.   I begun to follow Huff from the Wildcard episode, where he seemed nervous yet eager to give it another shot. The man is a grinning cariacature of mom's favourite son. Then he sang "Lean on me", and I was sold. The man has some powerful pipes. The song choice could not have been any better although he did have a very iffy start. He was good, but the question would beg, could he be better?  Down a couple of episodes and his rendition of "Ain't too proud to beg", formerly chosen by Ruben Stoddard, did it. Mr Huff had blown me to tears with his 1min 14sec songlet. It's not just the song, or the voice, but something about Mr Huff just gets you right in the pit of your stomach when he is on his game. And it feels damn good. The wonderful thing is he seems to be getting better still with each performance. Power to you, Mr Huff, this cynic is rooting for you.  All that philosophy just to plug Georgie Huff?, you might ask. I have to but sheepishly admit it.

      Dusted Days 5a (Feb 2000)  It is night time at Kent Ridge Park. We sit under a pavilion, the view of Keppel Harbour a strange comforting sight. It is a mix of romanctic beach and ugly technology. It is a Detroit or Seattle kind of image.   Like the youth of our time we take the opportunity to celebrate anything with booze, cigarettes, foul jokes and good company. Some of these guys have grown up with me in Normanton Park. Some are friends I met in school. Our pavilion overlooks the many dark carparks that litter the area. It is a lovers lane sort of place. Its fun in a "stand by me", voyeuristic kind of way. We look at the many cars with their fogged up windows and newspaper covered windscreens. Some cars have already started their steady bounce. Love is in the air, in the cars, and probably nicely positioned to avoid the much maligned steering wheels.   We always start in the pavilion, looking down and laughing, then we get drunker, some idiots like Adwin like to throw rocks and bricks at the cars.Its an idiot kind of enjoyment. Not really my style. If we dont succumb to the stupidity of vandalism, we usually start to creep about, hiding in the bushes or making very little sounds, peeking just over the windscreens and laughing whenever we see something naughty, it never is quite as frequent as we'd like it to be, but its a kick.  "Wah... This couple finish already"  "Hehe. She lying on top of him sial sleeping" "Haiyah pity she not naked" "Hmmm, her khaki pants quite tight hor" "Yah man quite the... Oi She not wearing pants lah!" "Guys guys." "Oh shit. Zhao! The fella wake up liao"  -Insert loud old man cursing and death threats here followed by boys laughing and bush scampering-  Its wicked fun. The darkness. The bush. The headlights of cars. Running throught the grass peeking over windscreens with the ever present risk of the people inside being wide awake and pissed. I always wondered why these people didn't just go home and do it. Most of them were not teens so they really would be no reason to play creep-about in some dodgy carpark in the middle of nowhere. Only later on would I learn from my ex about the thrills of exhibitionism and the thrill of maybe getting caught in the act...oh well.  One year was particularly scary.   There were only a few cars and a lorry. We had scoped out one car, with an amorous couple about to get down. The lorry was 3 lots away, parked, so we had crept towards the car, about to peek in.   This chinese guy with tattoos all over him sat up in the empty lorry and started swearing, he then took a machete out and started chasing us. He was pretty darn fast too  I remember running like crazy, leaping the stairs down hill 4 at a time. We all were running. This guy was way beyond mad. If he ever had caught one of us. I am sure beyond believe that someone would have been seriously hurt, if not killed, that night.  We only did this on special occasions. Chinese New Year, New Year, when all the mates could get out to party. We were in our teens and Kent Ridge Par was directly behind Normanton Park, my old place. Trust teenage ennui to think of such entertaining exploits such as trekking the 200 odd steps up the back of the ridge to the carpark to harass couples trying to get down to some nasty. It always begun that way. Booze in the estate till 10pm or so, then off to the ridge, hassle the lovers till near midnight. Walk around and smoke, talk smack, drink some more... Then onward...to the piece de Resistance..  The Haunted House of Kent Ridge Park  -to be continued-

      Dusted Days 4 (Mid 2002)  She had gone. The only girl I had truly loved. Name your cliche. Envelope of memories? Check. Airport Departure lounge? Check. Promising to keep in touch? Check.  Unfortunately for me she was the more prepared when we parted. I can say whatever I want to justify why it hit me so badly. But in hindsight, I have to be honest with myself. I was in denial and I couldn't bear to see it end. Even at the 11th hour I was still clinging to the notion that somehow, something would hold together and that her leaving would not signal the end of my rhapsody of her. Its funny. 2 years on and I still feel the twinge when I think of her.  I am over her I'm sure. Over in the sense that I know we will never be together again. But still. There is a feeling I get, a mood, a niche, an echo of emotion, a ghost of what once was a burning,bright flame. I guess there will always be residue, always a niggling, when I hear a familiar song, or place, or movie. Very Pavlovian, but very true.  The days after she left I spent in a stupor, walking a tightrope between unfeeling and feeling too much. The mood was distinctively surreal. Perth in the dead of winter, noone around. Emptiness in all the ways.   I remember that moment with trepidation. It was the lowest and most painful moment in my whole life. I still remember the pain which is so strange. Because you actually "feel" something. Right in the pit of your stomach. That hollow acute ache that does not dissapate at all. You try to sleep as much as you can. Forget it all. Sleep. Sleep it all away. But then there always is waking. You try to time it to get more daylight.   The worst are the nights. The nights overlooking the darkness. The crickets and the rain. The cold hum of the microwave. And the buzz of fluorescent tubes that echo the cold uncaring greyness that signifies your newest solitude.  There was noone to talk to. Everyone had gone home for the holidays and all around me was emptiness. I didnt go back 'cause my parents couldn't afford it. Being poor sucks. Period. Did I feel I was going out of my mind? Yes. Did I lose it completely and break down? I have to say I did.  Now one question I always asked myself was the whole "stay friends" or "cut it loose" thing. With all honesty I can say "cut it loose" is the best option. Why?   From my standpoint, you have already shared a moment with that person that is deeply personal and emotional, a bond that transcends normal friendship and all that crap. No disrespect for friends, but honestly, if you really TRULY loved that person before, I dont see how its possible to look at that person again in the future and pretend nothing happens while they have new partners whom you KNOW they're banging and all. Crude yes. But that is what we think of. At the end of the day, you don't want to know who your ex is screwing now. Freud can say whatever he wants but THAT is a definite psychological truism.  In anyone's mind, their Exs stopped having sex the moment they broke up, their organs dried up and they became single, lonesome pathetic shells of their former selves, eternally languishing in a private hell for never fully realising how YOU were the greatest love of their lives. That is what we ALL want in passing.  So, for being friends after breaking up? Having to marginalise whatever you shared before by diluting the future with diplomatic cafe chit chat and "How are you doing" pleasantries that have no actual emotional merit? Thats a bigger lie to me than just cutting it loose to begin with.   I did try it for awhile. But it just brought back the pain every time I spoke to her. Her nonchalant manner and coldness only worked against me. Foolishly, I asked her if she missed me, and she said "Not really". Reality has no save game function.  Give me unknowing. Give me the silence and the void. Sometimes, it really does work against you to know too much. I guess there is a reason why memories work the way they do and how things seem to dull in your recollections with age. We are meant to discard and forget the good times, and the pains. Meant to place away things in corners like old books that have grown yellow pages with age. That old smell, a fond, comforting moment when you dust it off and read it once, and then put it away for another few years.     I guess I just ain't one of those people who can do that. People ask me to see a picture of her when the rare moment the topic about her does crop up. I tell them I can't show them anything. I burnt all the pictures and I never left anything behind. Its true, I did. I dont have anything left from her. I have a strange feeling I don't need to, because I don't think Ill be forgetting anything about her, for a long, long time.

       Dusted Days 7    (1997)   I am about to die. Really, I am. There is no way I’m gonna survive this. I'm either gonna die because something has ruptured, or die because of the utter embarrassment I will suffer about this to the end of my very days.  One omnipotent question plagues my mind with the utmost universal importance, hammering into my skull with revelation-like significance.  If I knew this answer, the heavens would open up and the Archangels would draw swords of flame, singing symphonies of exultation for all eternity.  The question is...  "Will my bladder explode internally and send poisonous piss flowing all over the inside of my body if I keep holding on like this?"  You see, I am in a tour van to Haadyai. Since 7.30am this morning, this minivan of about 5 families including my own have departed my uncle's home in Penang for a drive up from Penang, through the Thai border, towards Haadyai.   Penang as you know, is the undisputed capital of sweet beverages. I kid you not.   If say, you were to stop reading this right now, and you would go to any coffeeshop in Penang, and order a black coffee, it would arrive with about a pound of cane sugar sitting at the bottom of the porcelain cup, and that's AFTER stirring. The same goes for any other mixed beverage you could order there. Teh Si Peng, Teh Peng, Kopi Peng, Cham Peng (1/2 coffee 1/2 tea), Milo, Horlicks, etc..  Everything comes with 1 bucket of sugar. Well, unless you ask for less or no sugar, in which case they only put in half, a bucket.  Read my lips... "Di-A-Be-Tes"  Unfortunately, If you have ever been to Penang, you would realise that not falling in love with the food and drinks there is a human failing of Mohammedan proportions. Resistance is futile. Char Kuay Teow, Kuay Teow Tng, Lo Bak, Muah Chee, Har Mee, Ju Hu Eng Chye and so on. There is NO way you can safely go to Penang and not eat the hawker fare there. Well, same goes for the drinks.  Maybe its the fact that Malaysian coffee and Tea is so deliciously over percolated and burnt to perfection in Penang. Maybe its the fact that you are sitting in a steamy, grimy hawker centre, smoking deliciously cheap Malaysian cigarettes, leaning you weight to stabilize the ridiculously bent aluminium table, while trying to keep your sandaled feet from touching the wet, stinking market floor.   Maybe its all of these things. But something about Penang makes people turn into pigs.   Anyway, after leaving my uncle's place at 7.30am we decide to go to Cross street to take the best Char Kuey Teow in the galaxy. Here we go, 5 families of my parents friends and their children, sitting in a van, talking about how Malaysians are SO in love with Phua Chu Kang and doing impersonations of PCK himself. Somehow I always envisioned travel as a Hemingwayesque activity with the class of solitude and romanticism about it.   "I’m sorry Sir, there are no more tickets for 'The English Patient'. Would you like to watch 'Dude Where's My Car', instead?"   So we arrive at Cross Street. This van of the Brady Bunch-lahs. I decide not to go nuts with the food. But I absolutely LOVE the Teh Si Peng in Penang. So I have one, and another. Now, I’m not a stupid person, I know the ride to Haadyai is going to be 7 hours at least but surely there are toilets if one REALLY needs to go.   Just in case I go to the loo anyway.  Now, if you have had the experience of ever travelling upstate from Singapore northwards with your family you would notice one thing.  Its like watching the reverse of 2001 A Space Odyssey  You start with the urban metropolis, Singapore, all steel and concrete and uber clean roads and infrared cash card readers and all that jazz, you got your nice clean toll booths and robotic people, McDonalds and Glenn "bloody" Ong and all the other recalcitrant tossers on radio, then you hit JB. Rewind about 30 years. Noisy non filtered scooters and motorbikes. Petronas stations, Large Paper advertisements...sigh, nostalgic. Suddenly the word "Awas" jolts itself back into your memory.  Cigarette Ads. Thank god. Salem high country with the half malay-half eurasian looking model who grins into the wild yonder of the matt background mountains. Kedai Electronik Lee Yong Pak. 90 sen Roti Chanai. Petrol stations with water pumps that say "Air". Cheap smokes. C'mon now, that’s like the very FIRST thing anyone who smokes does the moment they step in matland. Buy cheap ass bloody non over-taxed tyrant free fags.  So on and so forth. Open face motorbike helmets. Thank f-ing GOD! Open face beige motorcycle helmets! Little Tan Ah Whatever, driving around in his vespa, "put put put"-ing around the little roundabouts, plastic bag stuffed in the back helmet box, brown shorts and regulation generic black sandals, sucking on a nice old Lucky Strike, swearing under his breath in some teochew dialect.  Welcome to life.  Move further up north and "it" begins. The twenty year legacy that PLUS took to build, which is STILL not finished. The damn highway. Straight roads, plain stupid green rest stops and makan places. Nothing of real interest.   You hit Malacca and its back another 50 years or so. But in a weird way, because Malacca now is like a state sized version of what Clarke and Boat Quay are.   A plethora of quaint little 2 storey shophouses that have become trendy little Starbuck-ettes for you to sit by a marble topped table probably older than your mother, reading the International Herald Tribune or latest Chuck Palahniuk while the streets putter along with the strange mix of Volkwaagen convertibles and 2 ringgit Trishaw rides.   You walk along and you come to Heeren House. No. Not the HMV Singapore. The original Heeren. They sell anything from old charcoal irons to "I love Malacca" T shirts, to obligatory Tourist garbage like Chongkak boards and random brown photographs of some Nyonya family long extinct since the time the picture was taken out of the termite-eaten abandoned bureau from which it was housed.  My maternal great-grandmother lived in Malacca. She was still alive when I was young. She only spoke Baba malay, as did I. I spoke to her and she adored me. I must say there was something I loved about her. Something you share, across the reaches of time, that can only be conveyed in a hug, or a "usually gross", grandmotherly peck, or "Chium", as we called it. And there's always that smell. The "bedak" (powder that they use). But she was a sweet old lady, very unassuming. Naive, yes, but don't we all wish for that kind of peace when we hit her age.   She had a really strong prescription for her glasses, but there was something serene about her when she sat in the shadows of her second story room, looking through the wooden louvers down to the bustling Jonker Street below. That is the image I always carry of her. Sitting by the window, smile on her face, slats of light and the aura of experience. Respect that needs no command. Move over, Dame Judi Dench  Something about memories always ties in with food. I guess its an Asian thing. Food is so much more intertwined in our memories than with Western cultures. Malacca for one, is the place for Satay Chelup, Nasi Kari, and Wanton mee (or Kong Lo mee).   Wanton mee in Malacca rocks. You sit at the coffeeshop. And they seem to ALWAYS be positioned at street cornershops. Some guy who is DRIVING along the road in a motorcycle/mobile stove (yup that's right) will scream across the throng at you whether you want some good old Kong Lo. He'll park on the fringe, traffic will slow to an ebb since half his stove is sticking out the side of the street. Nobody really bitches about it though. He makes the noodles there as you watch through the sweltering afternoon heat. Steaming ladles of MSG laden soup. The beautiful handmade wantons. He flips the noodles in that semi flourish, semi nonchalance that comes from doing something as a trade for a long peiod of time.  He crosses the street, risking evisceration by the flatbed lorry that just honked him and serves you right at your table. All that and you pay him 2 ringgit. Bliss or what?   You slurp down the gorgeous noodles, sucking on your cheap cigarette, sweating beads down your underpants and legs, (God help you if you're wearing jeans) and for that moment, you kind of understand why white expatriate dung beetles don't want to go back to their god damn countries. This is just simply, too good.  We carry on up the highway, the good old robotic highway that is the universal attempt of every country to signal the beginning of modernization. The I20, M1, Autobahn, you name it.  Up the PLUS highway we go, hour plus... Hello KL.  Now I remember the drives up to KL, BEFORE the inception of the PLUS highways. You want adventure? Those were the days.  Imagine this.   You are about 11 years old. Your father drives a Mitsubishi Ex-Tredia. For all  intensive purposes, your Optimus Prime Transformers toy has more structural integrity than this car.  The power windows are not allowed to be wound past halfway, because they will not wind up again past that point. The air conditioning only works if its not too hot. You are along Yong Peng, driving, no let me rephrase, hurtling down a trunk road at about 130 km/h.  This connecting trunk road is an industrial one, so here you are, eyes closed into slits, coated in a fine layer of brown dust kicked up from the dirt road, as the 5 lorries of jelutong timber rumble in front of your dads flimsy old ex-tredia. Your insides have been reduced to gelatin by the constant reverberating and bouncing due to various potholes, gravel and dead animals that litter this Liberace of roads.   Between the heat, the brown crap in your eyes and the headaches that rack you from all the black diesel fumes, you wonder in all honesty... "Could puberty really be worse than this?"  Dad is feeling confident in the car, because he has a new pair of $200 tyres and just had Wing chun Auto do a wheel alignment and servicing on the car before making the drive up.   The AA batteries on your $40 Sony Walkman Xmas present are beginning to die. 2 Live Crew sings "Meeee sooooo Horrrrnnnnaaaaayyy" in a stretched out chorus as Dad decides to gun the milo-tin aluminium frame of a car into "overtake mode".  Being a trunk road it only has 2 lanes. Yours, and the Grim Reaper's.  He swerves out, his eyes inching past the side of the lumbering lorry, past the hanging iron chains and the bamboo poles with red cloth hanging on them. Just about to see the other oncoming lane. He swerves back.  -Voom!-   An oncoming car shoots past, followed by several others.   He waits a moment. With your brown dusted eyelids, you squint tighter as more brown crap is kicked up into the air, a rough patch of gravel on the road.Something just got into your eye, but you don't want to rub it in case its a random iron filing and you rub your way into Stevie Wonder's best friends diary.  Dad guns it again, and the car struggles to comply with his need for speed.  "Urrrr" the engine growns as the needle slowly inches up from 120 to 122...123...  A horn blares from the opposite end of the road. He swerves back  -Voom! Voom! Voom! Ehhhhhhhhhhputputputput!- 3 Cars and a scooter.  He does this dance a few times. In your mind, you see a figure cloaked in black, polishing a scythe, tapping its foot impatiently, smoking a cheap Malaysian cigarette.   A sudden stretch of clear road appears across and the road takes a slight C-turn  Dad floors it and the engine screams rather than growns.   The car cantankerously aches as it struggles to accelerate. A full car load of 4 people with flasks of coffee, multiple bags of chips, pillows and blankets, hurtles towards its unflinching date with destiny. Almost past the first lorry,   Oncoming headlights flash from across the brown miasma.  A long prolonged horn sounds just as the lorry driver relents and slows down, offering a gap between his front bumper and the next lorry.   Welcome to pre-Highway Malaysian upstate driving.  Anyway, in all honesty, I have never understood the whole vibe about Kuala Lumpur. If you asked me to imagine KL city, first thing Id think of is the Lot 10 building, Brannigans, Hard Rock Cafe and Jalan Ah Lor.  Later on of course they got the Petronas building, but really, I dont see the fun in KL at all. I guess they do have some nice things sorta, like Bangsar and the whole pub thing, and maybe the here and there food stuff like Bak Kut Teh and HK Chee Cheong Fun but unless its F1 season or you are into shopping, KL is quite forgettable.   I used to have a place at Mont Kiara, at Taman Sri Hartamas, it was cool being able to walk downstairs to  Coffee Bean and have a Pure Vanilla while smoking Salem for 2.20 ringgit.   KL is a swell place to go with a f-buddy. If you wanna live it up relatively cheaply, and bang your nights away, KL is the living end.   Have you tried to take the public bus in KL? Don't. You will never ever live down how scary that can be. Trust me. Ever had that feeling where you boarded the wrong bus but out of some morbid and sick fascination you decided to stay on and see if further on you would stumble onto some landmark relatively familiar?  To put things briefly, I ended up in Klang. There were no stops along the ride I was on. Actually, there were no bus shelters along the way.  I’m surprised they never asked for passports on the ride, because when I got off, I swore I was like Sam Waterston on the set of the Killing Fields.   In Klang, there were people on iron bicycles selling Arowana fish in plastic bags that they had caught from the various longkangs and streams. Forget that. These people were selling Luohan fish before the craze a whole decade later.   So up from KL to Penang. I know some of you might stop by Ipoh. But I personally have never been there. Although I hear that crayfish hor fun is THE thing to try in Ipoh.  One day. One day, I will make it a point to see EVERYTHING in Malaysia. East Coast and West Coast. Well, maybe all except for Kelantan. That place scares me.  Ah Penang.   I have to admit. The first time you cross that bridge, its an experience. The Pearl of the Orient, they call it. Then you smell that pearl. Penang has a lot of swamp and marshland, so during low tide the muddy smell is really strong. Strong enough to look at the person next to you and give him/her a interrogating gaze.  Was that from you???  Penang is Scooterville. you think JB had scooters? You aint seen nothing yet. Penang is like the Malaysian official state of Vespa and all its cousins. And there is something undeniably sexy about Penang gals. Penang women have like the most awesome legs. Being a legs man, I can attest to that. There is a weird sexual energy that comes from seeing a hot Penang gal in a skirt, with a hint of leg, straddling a scooter with her back arched straight, perfect posture, with her beautiful face underneath that open face scooter helmet with a hint of fringe accompanying her beautiful wide eyes and pearlesque skin. Fair skin beauties are a trademark of Penang.   As you noticed I mentioned skirt. All this modern crap has killed the fashion of the skirt. I'm not talking one night stand trampy mini skirt either. A nice long skirt that hints at a figure, ending somewhere at knee level or further is the absolute zen of the Penang beauty. That quirky Penang Hokkien that lilts and harps brings a renewed wonder to an otherwise guttural language. Anyone who has heard the local Singaporean trash Hokkien slur can attest to that. In Singapore, you almost expect the sentence to end in the sound of someone spitting a wad onto the sidewalk. Not in Penang.   In Penang, the right Penang beauty speaking can make you want to rip out your still beating heart, put it in a nice glittering box, dress it up in fancy ribbons, and present it to her along with a wedding ring and a prolonged contract promising unending, wedded bliss.  The Penang beauty has legs and an ass to kill for, flawless light skin, and the eyes that could melt the heart of Lenin.   Oh, and unless you are a local or formerly from Penang, do NOT attempt to drive there, because I'd give you all of 10 minutes before you completely lost your mind. No, make that 5, no 4..  Just don't drive there. Trust me. Blind corner scooter overtaking you from the left? Just another normal thing on the streets of Penang. Not to mention parking.   One sad thing about Penang now is that Gurney Drive is no longer what it once was about 7 or 8 years ago. All that state driven parking and tourism commision clampdown crap has shut down what used to be an awesome carnavale style bazaar atmosphere of knock off T shirts, CDs, Cassettes, Snacks and Desserts.   There was absolutely nothing like walking down the gasoline powered lighting of Gurney drive, chomping on your 1 ringgit worth of muah chee, looking for a copy of KLF's white Room album, while wearing your 4 ringgit Bodyglove T shirt and knock off Levis 501s bought from some guy who sold Polo Ralph shirts with 6 legged horses.     Fast forward where our story had taken that meandering segue.  So. 2 Teh Si Pengs and one loo visit and we board the tour van thingy for the drive up to Haadyai. This would be my first visit to Thailand. And I was pretty excited.   It was like 2 hours into this drive when I felt a niggling sensation. The Tehs were creeping up on me. The Thai border was looming any time now but I was worried. The PLUS highway had ended a long time ago and we were on a trunk road, like the days of old. But then the reverse time machine struck again.   There was slowly no more dirty trunk road. There was no road, period. There was just dirt. We were driving along dust rumbling up and down like a the party wagon of the Ninja Turtles.  I had grown silent about an hour before. The unpleasant feeling of needing to go had turned into a yell.   Bladder: "Oi! Must pee! Must pee! Who the hell ask you to drink two Teh Si Peng?" Me: "I’m sorry lah, but we were leaving Penang, no more Teh for awhile leh so I drink lah" Bladder: "Ok then. You want to be the hero? Now I laugh. I will laugh when you cannot tahan and pee yourself in this van with 5 families sitting around you. Congratulations Teahead!"  And so in silent scream I fought and wrestled with the demon bladder. Unlike Malaysia, the roads up to the border of Thailand are not lined with acres of rubber trees or that kinda crap. Its all flat, paddy field no shrubbery kind of dirt. Which means if I pee along the side of the road. Everybody 500 metres around me can sketch a picture as I do it. There is absolutely NO COVER at all.  And I’m dying here.   Coming to the border we ask if theres a toilet availible. Yes, they do, but the lanes are packed and theres no where to park without hindering traffic. The border guy looks at me funny. Maybe its because my face is kind of purple and one eye is twitching spasmically.   The driver tries to assure me by saying there is a reststop 45 minutes past the border. We can stop there.   I wanted to whip it out and pee right there on his bloody forehead.     1 1/2 hours later, the thoughts "long term damage" and "internal hemorrhage" run through my mind. It takes all the effort in the world to sit still and will my sphincter from not unleashing the Great Flood of Noah. I have long since broken my silence to the rest of the passengers about my plight and am rhythmically banging my head against the jamb of the van's sliding door.    My abdomen pounds with my pulse. Throbbing in pain, I grit my teeth and swear that any moment now I won't be able to hold it and I'll pee the very life out of me. Screw this people. Screw face. Screw self respect. I'm dying. I'm physically doing myself damage for not going since 4 hours ago when the alarms started ringing. The Thai driver plainly chuckles and makes some stupid joke in his broken English. One of my father's friends takes a thermos and trickles hot water into a cup in front of my face. Another does a stupid whistling thing.   I imagine how much laughter I'll get if I pee right on his little 5 year old boy. Trickle that asswipe.  My vision blurs and time seizes to have any meaning for me. All I can think of is the pain. And control.   Hold on Darren. Just hold the f on. I swear each minute seems like an hour. On the left and right of me, the horizon is an unbroken horizon of greenish brown dirt. No mounds, no hills, no shrubs. I remember seeing a buffalo once. I actually consider taking a leak behind this creature but i wonder if getting that close will startle it into going schizoid and goring me to death in a hail of horns, blood and piss. Its a risk I’m willing to take, but the driver says he can't stop here as its a highway.   Some f-ing highway. No lines, no margins, not even a bloody road.  After what seems to me like 30 agonizing minutes, the driver says that there is a small coffeeshop. We can stop there but we are only 15 minutes into Haadyai proper. My mom makes it clear that we will stop. I say nothing. One word from me and I will lose control and pee on everyone. We stop, and I look at my watch. It wasn’t 30 mins at all. It was more like an hour or so. I must have been in so much pain that I lost track of time.   I give the waiter an evil eye and motion to the rest of the group. Take their order instead, leave me alone. I shove people aside and hunt in the back of the place for a toilet. There is a little shack away from the eatery. I enter and then I see it…  Forget cubicles or doors or even bowls. One hole. In the middle of the ground. Rolls of toilet paper hanging from a pole hammered into the dirt a short distance away. Telling from the foot prints I can tell that this hole has a 360 degree range of clientele. I guess its the newest thing in Third World chic. Unisex salons, clothes, now toilets. One hole for everybody. King Mongkut would be so proud.  As I finally get to go, I actually have sparks swimming in front of my eyes. It hurts like a bitch holding on for so long. Out of a morbid curiosity I stopwatch how long I’m gonna be at this. I'll never be so busting to go ever again in my life, so I might as well know what the world record is gonna be.   4 minutes 53 seconds. Those numbers will be etched into my brain for all eternity. You try peeing for almost 5 minutes straight. Not with a yardarm of beer could you do this. A once in a lifetime event. Definitely.  As I zip myself up and hobble away with my painful nether regions still hurting, I look back at what has got to be the most terrible looking place I have ever had to go in. There is a pail with some water to wash hands in. But the water is maroon and I dont see any soap anywhere in sight. Seeing how the rolls on the pole have long since emptied, I decide that Cholera is not really something I want to take back as a souvenir from Thailand and this remarkable hole which I shall henceforth name as the Doom Chasm of Thailand.   I am off to find mom and some alcoholic handwipes. I go back into the shop via the backway but I stop short and look up at the hand painted sign hanging above the doorway.

      Dusted Days 10 (December, 1996)  In my soul, I am grumbling. This feels just like school. To be more exact, this feels like Saturdays at school, when you grudgingly whine about having to participate in your compulsory Extra Curricular Activity. Only thing is that I’m not at school, and this is not a school toilet.  Here I am, looking into a cheap toilet mirror. The glass is chipped at one edge, and the mirrored backing has worn off at parts, the corner of my reflected face is fragmented in a spider web configuration that follows the broken part of the mirror’s edge.  I carefully light the green circular tin can, heating up the bottom. I hold my little disposable lighter flame there till I cannot bear the heat any longer.  The tin is the ouchies. I wince at the heat and I put the tin down. It clatters in that flat, hollow echo that is synonymous with public restrooms. I wait for awhile.  After a while, I pick the tin up and work off the lid. Inside is the dark green camouflage paste that has melted from its usual solid form. Carefully, using two fingers, I scrape up a bit of the coloured paste, and apply a dark line across the crest of my cheekbones. I look at myself, my face now having two lines of dark green under the eyes, like an American Football player. Not exactly the look I was going for. It needs work.   “Oi Saw. Here.”, my Malay friend nudges me with his elbow and puts a black tube at the edge of my wash basin. In return, I give him the can of green paste.   I pick up the tube and squeeze the dark inky paste onto my palm. I work it out and I begin to put dark dots down the centre of my brow and furrow line, all the way down the ridge of my nose...  I finish my look and it’s not bad at all. Quite convincing. I turn to face my compatriots. They give me the thumbs up. Ben Heng, (Yes. TCS Ben Heng) aka. Frankenstein, rips open a cheap packet of toy feathers. It looks like the kind of packet you would find at an old shop in Chinatown. Dusty cardboard and cheap plastic packaging, held together with one staple. He counts the number of dusty coloured plastic feathers  “Wah lan.”, he moans. “Not enough feathers.”  Another of our group comes into the toilet. In his hand he is carrying 3 pieces of vanguard sheet that have been glued/stapled together to roughly fit around our temples like cardboard crowns. The idea is to glue the feathers to the rings, making headdresses. American Indian Headdresses. Apache Headdresses. The problem is there are seven of us, and we only have material for three headdresses.   We are nothing but a bunch of worthless, bald headed recruits. This is Nee Soon School of Basic Military Training, and tonight is the CO evening talent time.  For the past few days, while our campmates have been slogging with practice drills and doing exhausting chores and route marches, the seven of us have had the luxury of doing nothing more than sitting in an air conditioned room, tinkering away on our guitars. The best part of all is that it’s sanctioned by the Company Line. All this time that Nee Soon’s been around, Alpha Company has been remarkable in the fact that it has never placed, let alone won anything for the CO evening. Its become something of a long-established joke in the camp and Alpha (or Apache company) as we are called, are desperate to break the duck.  This year Apache is surprisingly gifted in the musical department.   We have one semi-professional singer, one Malay wedding guitarist, one Peranakan Gen X-wannabe guitarist (Me), one Chinese thespian-guitarist (Frankenstein), one Indian guitarist, one Eurasian guitarist who speaks in an accent that no one can understand (He studied in Yankville) and one more Malay guy who has absolutely no musical bone in his body but reckons he can cut it with a tambourine (He sucks.)  With this incredible guitar overdose, the powers that be of Alpha company (that rhymes!) hatch a diabolical plan to bring CO evening to its knees. We are christened “the 7 little Indian boys” and we have been given 3 days, aside from the usual Army torture of exercise and verbal abuse, to get our act together. Since nobody in the actual company hierarchy knows anything about music, we are left to our own devices.   And so, we get down to the grindstone and we hammer out a set of 3 songs. Considering the CO and just about every senior person there is going to be as uncool as our parents and into crap like Barry Manilow and stuff, we decide to try the Eagles. And so we work at it. We spend whatever free time we have (In the Army, that’s not much), working on material and bandying ideas.  Finally we get our play list. It’s not exactly what I would love to play, but for a night off and 3 days of shirking duties, I’d even play Whitney Houston.   1) Hotel California - Eagles 2) La Bamba – Richie Valens  3) Love will keep us alive - Eagles  We are finishing our practice on the eve of the actual event when I’m asked for input by the band.   “Saw. The song, this part a little bit empty. How?”, questions our O fearless leader, as we jangle away in the cosy air-conditioned briefing room. Its funny, but somehow vocalists always wield so much power in a musical cooperative.   “How? Like that lor”, I answer shrugging.   I try to persuade him to get the wedding music guy to come up with a solo, but everybody else including the wedding guy doesn’t want him to play another solo. He already has three. They look at me because I’m probably next up in the hierarchy. Not really thinking about it, I say “Sure. I’ll play a little something” and I just shrug it off again. I hardly worry about it at all.   Until I actually do start worrying, then I curse my thick-headedness.  Now with not much time to go, I’m standing here in front of this mirror, with paint on my face, and I’m absolutely bloody terrified. It’s about half an hour before the show starts. Who am I kidding? I CAN’T BLOODY SOLO!  Guys who know me through music know that I can write songs. I can write rhythm licks and play them. Heck. I can even sing somewhat. But for the life of me I have never in my entire playing time, ever managed a proper solo, not one that arises from that place in guys like Jimi Hendrix, you know what I mean? I’m not one of those guys who can get an artistic hard-on and then proceed to play the musical equivalent of an eargasmic 279-note doggie-style exhibitionist sextravaganza by feeling alone. I just never seem to remember the shapes of scales on the fret board. I can play a solo by rote, maybe. But seeing how this solo in “Love will keep us alive” doesn’t even exist in the actual song, I am screwed.  So for me, trying to solo is like the inaugural sex with someone new. Every bit is nerve wracking and you only realise how lousy you were, by the degree of silence when you finally finish, if you manage to finish at all.  The rest of Alpha seems to have faith in us and other than the solo thing and the guy who can’t play a tambourine on time even if someone held a revolver to his head, every thing else is hunky dory. The PC even sends two non-players home to get their guitars when he hears them talking about having them. All of us can tell that Alpha wants this bad. It’s going to be our necks if we suck.  The two poor joes come back with their instruments. One is a sweet looking Martin guitar and the other is a pretty fine 12-string. I decide to ditch the $15 Mat Yoyo guitar that I borrowed from someone in camp and use the 12 string. It is like silk to my ears. I am one man, playing two guitars at once now.   Snap back to reality.  The hall is jam packed. Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Hotel, Kilo, Ninja... the list goes on and on, company after company are marched in and packed into the hall. The first bits are formalities, the CO addressing us about being recruits, and our responsibilities to our country and so on. I glance over and look at my fellow Indians. We look like idiots. With permission, we have torn off our training vest sleeves to look rugged (actually we just look destitute), and we have worn our number 4 trousers, so we all look like Guile from Street Fighter. We did the obligatory war paint thing as a homage to our company call sign. Alpha Company. The Apaches.  Of us Indians, the ones with headdresses look like peacocks. O fearless leader has decided to hijack most of the feathers for himself, so he looks like Old Chief One Broken Horn with a long feathered train, while we just look like parakeets who have been left alone for too long, moulting and in serious disrepair. One feather here, two feathers there. I have one feather, and I look like Pocahontas. It gets on my nerves and I pluck it off.  “Here Chief”. I hand the irritating thing over to fearless leader, “you just got promoted.”  The night gets underway and I guess because it IS the Singapore Army that we are talking about, most of the acts frankly, erm, suck. Here’s a sample of some of them...  There’s some lame sketch about Army fashion, where they get recruits to walk out in various prohibited combinations of the Army uniform. Things like a long four shirt with PT shorts and slippers, or a singlet with helmet, boxer shorts and boots. You know, Stupid crap. Then some guy voices over like it’s a catwalk in Milan or something...   AV: “This combination is fabulous for the modern soldier, combining elegance and sexuality in one simple yet flamboyant combination”...   Erm okay. It just looks like a towel, shorts and a bar of soap to me. I feel pity for the guy modelling. He should have killed himself yesterday. “I’m too sexy” plays in the background and when the skit ends, the audience does not clap as much as it does sigh in relief.  Another skit has the people of Delta company working overtime backstage. They have 4 recruits standing on lockboxes on stage, the rest of them are behind going crazy with the lighting intensity knobs. Some techno garbage is playing on the AV and the lights are going on and off like strobes.   My best guess is that its some kind of dance performance where the dancers kind of swivel around with their hips where they stand, while the lights go spastic. Music Box Dancer ‘96. The music is sickening Chinese style techno and I guess nobody from Delta company thought about doing an end user value study when they thought about this monstrosity. The CO is whispering into his assistant’s ear. My best guess at what he’s saying is “I want urine tests done for this whole platoon.”   As the night progresses, I am steadily getting more concerned, I run through the finger positions in my head, trying to visually photograph every step that I had thought up in practice before we got to the hall. I glance at my watch and I’m clammy in the palms. Why didn’t I just beg wedding guy to do it?   The night progresses. Hotel company do a skit where they cover their heads and draw faces on their bellies. Each belly button is a mouth and each set of nipples are eyes, with makeup to finish the caricatures. Then they have some dialogue thing in Army lingo and the bellies jiggle as they talk. Its cheap toilet humour but it works, everyone laughs. The Army is not a breeding ground for high brow types. Turd jokes rule in this part of town.  One other act goes on stage and plays some musical number and sings. I do believe its Jamiroquai. The guy tries to perform and play and almost pulls it off. He has balls for going up solo, but unfortunately he cocks up his playing and straight away, gets a whole number of boos. The crowd are imbeciles, but what do you expect? It’s the Army.  Finally we’re up and for some reason, we’re the last ones to go on stage. We do a short skit where we come out all disorganised and Broken Horn plays the Sergeant, telling us to get in line and all that. We get the chuckle here and there. Tough crowd. We decided to cut out the comedic horseshit and settle down. We pull out the chairs and settle down, tuning and mic-ing up. A slight hum grows from the audience. They are growing restless, but are exercising restraint because we look fairly interesting with 5 guitars on stage.  We start with “Hotel California”.   As soon as the tambourine begins and the first plucking notes of the song begin, the roar becomes deafening. Seeing how most of my Army batch were predominantly of Chinese education, I certainly had not expected this. As I play, I feel my face getting red hot. My blood is heating up and the creeping feeling of hairs beginning to stand undulates up and down the back of my neck. I have had this feeling before. This is the rush of performance adrenaline. It is exquisite. The five guitars swim between each other effortlessly, the layers of melody ebb and flow as the mood of the song steadily fills the hall.  One Horn hits the mic and starts to sing and straight away the audience cheers. He is smack on pitch and the spirit of the song is too tempting to resist. We were right on the money with the songs we picked. I have to physically stop myself from unconsciously speeding up as I play from the rush I’m getting. It may be a cliché, but in music, when everything clicks and a group of people play as one, the results can simply floor you. I’m playing and even I’m floored.  An echoed staccato fills the ambience of the hall. The mob have decided to clap along with us. I can hear some in the crowd singing along. The Chinese educated ones. They sing along loudly and with gusto, and like the karaoke videos that taught them the song, get almost every single lyric wrong. But it is ok lah. Rock never die (sic).  The song ends to a thunderous applause. Time for the next one. I play the intro to La Bamba. I’m the only one who knows the riff. On a twelve string the riff takes on a whole different dimension, but the madness continues, the crowd sings alone with each chorus   “LA LA LA LA LA BAMBA ! LA LA LA LA LA BAMBA Oy esposito”... It fades off very quickly from here on in. I don’t blame them. I don’t even know most of the lyrics myself.  The clapping continues through the song though, which is a god send considering Tambourine dude is crapping up a simple 4/4 beat with masterful non-precision. Somehow I think he wanted in on the group for the off pass and not for his playing prowess or some musical ideal.  La Bamba ends and now its time for “Love will keep us alive”. Tambourino sits this out, we deny him the pleasure of mangling this rhythm like he did previously.   The slow song starts, and unlike the rest, the crowd goes silent. This is not an audience participation song. This is a song that reminds you of missing girlfriends and lovers on the outside. I think about my girl, Chloe, once my closest female friend and now a testament to the fact that sometimes, best friends don’t necessarily make best boyfriend/girlfriends. But that’s another story altogether.  One Horn is masterful. Holding his hand over his heart in the same pop star fashion that would have panties flying on stage at Tom Jones, he nudges, caresses, lifts and drags the audience through the performance with his voice, which is pretty f-ing good. I never thought a Malay guy could enrapture such a large Chinese audience, but somehow, he’s done it. He sings on. Carrying through the second chorus and then I prepare for my solo.  Crapfucky! What the hell was my solo again ???  I am seconds away from my grand 12 string guitar solo and I’ve forgotten the damn thing. My flushing face is now almost on fire. My mind is thinking a hundred things at once. I search my memory for the patterns and shapes that I had visioned before, but they are not there. I’ve got no time.   Oh god.... I’ve got no fuckiin time!   ...will keep us alive”, One Horn ends his part, and turns to me with a smile.   Time to dance, little monkey.    First note, seventh fret. That’s all I know at this point. I play and as I play that note I rack my brain to craft the shapes following that note. I have never done this before successfully. I am begging. I keep on playing, so far no death. Pleading with the spirits of guitar playing to grant me this one moment of illumination. One moment against all the times I ever screwed up a solo in the home, in my playing ever, in my life. Still no death. This one time I fight, for every single note that follows the last, trying to remember where I had gone wrong in the past, the places I had gone off the tracks and slammed headfirst into the wall of the wrong freaking notes. I’m still alive.  I lay it all down the line. I need this now more than ever. The eyes are on me. The song is on me. The spirit of this night and the seven of us, rests on this moment, I cannot fail. Like a tap dancer on a sea of broken glass, like a game of minesweeper, I wade through the numerous death-traps that lie in store for me on the fret board. I play this solo like its going to be the last solo I play in my life. I bend strings to pitch, I try simple arpeggios, I do mad things that I would call myself crazy at even trying, were it not for the fact that a lot rested on this moment. This 16 bars are frozen for me for all eternity. This is the day I took a leap of faith into the divine. The day I laid it out on the line for the music. I could have failed spectacularly, the equaliser was all on me and everyone listened. And terrified yet faithfully, I kept playing.  My solo ends. One Horn smiles and turns to finish the song. I can see a moisture in his eyes. The solo was not only unblemished, it was beautiful.   Then like a wave that hits a sand bank, the cheers and applause washes up in a tide that sweeps me, bathes me, and takes me to a place that transcends the cold grey walls of this Army Camp, past the stupid, ignorant faces of the officers, past the glare and headlights of the stage. My spirit is soaring, and I am drunk on the bliss of my heavenly experience.  It is one of the moments when I feel the love for something greater and purer than light. Purer that any words can ever express. It is a place that is all that is beautiful and uplifting about the power and humanity of music.   And this moment is all mine.  Several hours later...   It’s almost a fog in here. The smoking area is unbelievably loud. One Horn takes a big swig from the bottle of champagne, and hands it over to me.  I take the bottle from him and swig too, laughing as I do. Charles the platoon clown retells the story of our performance to a packed smoking box of people, in Hokkien of course. Tambourino and the rest are handing out Kit-Kats to the rest of Alpha. Some get a piece, some break a piece and share the chocolate. Some are humming “Hotel California” as they finish their cigarettes and head up to the showers. Frankenstein, me and One Horn all suck back deeply on our cigarettes, exhaling deeply and delighting in the post performance buzz.   “Oi. Saw.”  I glance up from the steps and it’s the Platoon Sergeant. He holds out the passes for tommorow evening off. I take them from him. “Finished so quickly?”, he asks, looking at the green cellophane that is all that’s left of the prize hamper, lying in the trash bin. We nod casually, motioning to the goodies that are being shared all around now.  He shrugs it off. He leans in to me and pats me around the shoulders then drops something in my lap and walks away. I faintly hear, “Good job guys”, as he leaves. I pick up the trophy from my lap and look at it. The inscription reads:   To: 	ALPHA COY 	BMTC  (NEE SOON) 	 	C.O’s EVENING 	DECEMBER 1996 	1st place 	CHAMPIONS

      Dusted Days 9  (February 1998)  Hmmm. There’s a spot that’s discoloured.   I am lying on my bed, looking at the ceiling above me. The birds here do sound weird, alien sounding. Hooting or cackling? Both?   I struggle to find the right term. Birds don’t hoot-cackle like that in Singapore.   I strum my guitar and look at the room around me. The whitewashed brickwork betrays the Spartan nature of the room. My belongings lie in a spot on a shelf, fastened in a bracket on the wall, and in a basket under my bed. This will be my home, for the next year, at least. My parents flew off this morning and have gone back to Singapore. Strange. I don’t really miss Singapore at all.   The table is Formica layered. Cheap and disposable. The room is long and rectangular. It looks unnaturally narrow. There are two beds in the room. Mine, which is occupied, and the other, which is currently empty.   This is Edwards College Student Village and I’m about a week early for the school semester. The village is virtually empty except for me, and Mustafa, or Mus for short. Mus lives in the room across the hall. He is Indonesian but is Middle Eastern by birth. He is skinny, with a rat like face. He looks untrustworthy and sneaky. He has only come out once, when my folks were over to take a look at my room. He said all the right things in the unwritten code of housemates, allaying my parents queries easily.   But I know. I know that being a good little student is probably the last thing that goes on in this college. I absolutely can’t wait for the mad stuff to begin.   I lean back on my bed and think. Finally, I am out of Singapore. I’m done with my service to old uncle Harry the bastard. My citizenship is restored and I’ve “earned” my stripes as a Singaporean. Whatever.  I heard too much of the same things from people for me not to believe it. They all say the same thing. Perth is boring. Perth is drab, dull and eventually, “All you do is stare at the four walls all day”, as Karin Goh put it.  I have no idea what Karin Goh is talking about.   I’m pumped. For the first time in my life I can do anything I want. I can stay up late. I can take drugs if I want. I can grow my hair long and keep my long awaited goatee. I can party all night and sleep all day. I can burn out, rather than fade away…  Sorry, I just had to fit in that line somewhere.   So I bask in my new found freedom, lying on the bed, looking at the ceiling, thinking of all the things that have come before me, and all the things that have passed. I think of my time in the Army and the good people I met. I think about my life so far and how coming to Perth signals a new beginning  for me. A new slate to draw a new picture. Kind of like being reborn. I feel that nervous anxiety that always seems to come from the first day of something new.   It is the same feeling I felt during the first day of Primary 1, first day of Secondary 1, First day at IBMEC, First day being a botak kenchi in Nee Soon Camp. First day at work, and so on. I make it a point to remember this day. The day I laid on my bed in Edwards College and looked up at the ceiling, listening to the birds cackle-hoot on a cosy, task free Saturday afternoon.   Wow. First year university. Never thought you would make it that far did you Darren? I make it a strong mental note that I absolutely cannot allow myself to screw up in College. Nothing would crush me more than to go back to all the bitchy friends of my mother, who would have a field day with the gossip and the “I told you so”s.   Its ironic how they sit close to each other and share chummy chummy conversations but every now and then, they get together and all they talk about is whose child is the biggest f_ck up of the lot. They relish these things, yapping and bitching about each other’s children.   Its their way of restoring importance with their lives, best parts of which have flowed down the domestic drainpipe of being good mothers and wives. I’ve respect for mothers and wives. But no respect for the bitching. Not at all. Get a hobby, or get an affair, do either. Screw the talking about people’s kids like some arsehole tabloid magazine.  Like Tyler Durden said, “We are a generation of men raised by women, I’m beginning to wonder if another woman is what we really need.”  So I make a resolution to myself. No screwing up in college.   This calls for a cigarette. But I have none. I need one really badly.   Hmmm… Mus looks like a smoker. But I hardly know him. How am I going to broach the subject? My criminal mind begins to revv in overdrive. I think and I open my room door and listen in the hallway.   Woo… faint sounds coming from his door. He is playing mp3s on his small Compaq laptop. Hmm. Scar Tissue by Red Hot Chilli Peppers. I plan my move.  Ten minutes later, Mus is stirring. Sounds like he may be coming out for something. I kick my door open and nonchalantly play the riffs for “Under the bridge”. I even play the couple of embellished notes that are a pain to reach. I hope I catch his attention. I look at the fret board, making sure my notes are clear. I pretend to be concentrating when I can actually play this song in my sleep. I look frank and ernest. I hope they don’t look back.   “Wow. You are quite good at guitar huh?”, he says, standing in the doorway. I just mumble some ineffectual modest answer that I always do.   I don’t consider myself good, but I know at least I can play something, after all I took it upon myself to learn from scratch about 6 years ago. I play a bit more and just smile and make a half assed comment about just playing songs for fun. Of course its for fun Darren, what the hell are you smoking?   Nothing. Which is why I’ve fallen back on making stupid ineffectual comments. Damn nicotine is such an evil master.  I just smile at him. It’s obvious he’s stunned. Usually the ones who can’t play are always floored. But as honest and cliché as it sounds, anyone can play the dookie I play, all it takes is practice. Who says you can’t do anything with a blockheaded stubborn attitude?  Guitar is not the Mauna Kea of music instruments. Its fairly easy to teach oneself. Really, its true. Don’t take some stupid Yamaha course at $40 for half hour. It’s a rip-off.   I took organ lessons in my younger days. It was expensive, it was constipated, and eventually it was the very thing that killed off my love for wanting to play the spleen, liver, gall bladder or any other organ for the rest of my life.   Yamaha, I don’t know how they are like now, but back then it was incredibly stuffy and systematic.   My organ teacher, Sally: “Okay Darren, what do you want to play?” Me: “There’s this song by Nirvana.”. I let her hear it. Sally: “Erm. Okay. Oh look! Let’s learn to play ‘Little brown jug’, okay” ?  The least she could have done is at least attempt to fuel my interest. Teach me the god damned Tori Amos version at least, bitch.    But no, even if I can learn it, when it comes to grading time, besides testing to see if you got hearing like a dog (Ok Darren. Take off the blindfold and play the note that you just heard. Oh. Good boy!), and seeing if you can read squiggly Tau Gay notes fast enough to play them back, they also let you choose between playing the exam pieces Little Brown Jug I, Little Brown Jug II, and Little Brown Jug III.  Eventually I put away the kidney and refused to do anything with organ lessons. I cried, I bawled my eyes out, I declared insanity. And finally the day came when the Karung Guni man came and took away good old Yamaha model whatever electronic keyboard lung thing for $50.   Music is one thing you can’t learn under the stress of time limits and half hour classes. Teaching myself to play was arguably the best decision I ever decided to do. There was a real sense of satisfaction when you hit the ability to play, and nobody can or has managed to take that away from me. It’s a fine thing to be able to hear something in your head, write it down, play it, and if you want, record it in the future. It’s even sweeter when you teach yourself, because when you arrive, it is entirely the fruition of your own spirit and balls. Maybe I’m over dramatizing it, but it’s the little hills you climb that you remember in your life.  There never was anything so beautiful as the labour of creativity. Imagine Michaelangelo as he painted the Sistine Chapel. Imagine Tolkien just as he finished writing Lord of the Rings. Imagine Lennon, writing Imagine.   If we get a high from these things now, imagine these guys when they finished creating them. There are simply no words to convey such exultation.  Back to Mus.  He asks me if I can teach him, and like anybody who has ever asked me to teach them, I agree and refuse any discussion about money or payment. The gift of sharing music should never be at the expense of money. Anyone who is not professionally trained should have no right in making money of others like that. Unless you paid to learn, why should others pay to learn from you? That’s my opinion, anyway.  But I’m a bastard and tell him that I wouldn’t mind smokes if he had them, though.  Mus offers me Marlboro Reds, something I personally have never smoked or preferred to smoke, but beggars choosers and all, I take the pack, and smoke with him on the veranda. Mustafa is happy that I can teach him something to play. And I’m happy because my plan for fags worked to a T.  What can I say? Everybody’s got a weakness. And like any smoke you get after you’ve run out, this is the best one I’ve had all day…

      Dusted Days 8 (1992)  “Eh cockernathan! Can you go over the bloody ledge or not?”  The malay instructor is pissed. He looks at me in indignation as I tremble-shamble backwards, gingerly over the rocky outcrop. The sun blazes overhead and the heat is being reflected off the hot white rock, making me perspire profusely.  My legs are spindly and spider-like, and chatter like twigs as I inch my terrified body towards the chasm of Khazad-Dum.   Well, it might as well have been. I am no man yet, only 15. Imp just a kid. A little bloody kid.  And I’m scared as heck.  My heart races in my chest. I fumble with the strap around my chin, making sure its fastened properly. The carabineer and rope around my waist and groin tightens as the man holding the safety begins to taut the line. I struggle to breathe.   Breathe Darren. Breathe. I’m close to the edge of the ledge, where the rock ends and nothingness begins. A long way down the side of the rocky face. Bits of shrub and green pepper the face sporadically, but for most parts, there is nothing but rock, to which I can dash myself to bits or miss entirely and plunge to my demise.   Welcome to the Outward Bound School. This is abseiling and the hill is owning my ass.   This is the second day of a 3 day/2 night OBS tour. I love camping, the prospect of going somewhere to rough it out with mates and friends, living under the stars and shedding the shackles of city life. It’s the smell of greenish water, the sting of a mosquito, the peel of your skin as the sunburn wrecks havoc on your shoulders and neck.    This is life. This is living. There is something Spartan but spiritual in taking a cold shower with a block of soap and drying yourself off with a rough towel that you don’t usually use. There is excitement in taking a steel tray to take food from a cookhouse, having food slapped onto your tray, like a convict. Like a slave. MSG does not flavour the life of the thrill seeker.  This is a taste of utopia where mother nature is the boss with no hesitance in kicking you in the nuts to remind you how powerless and insignificant you really are.  Just like I am feeling right now.   The thing that really gets to me about abseiling is the fact that for you to stay in control as you descend, you have to really kind of lean back and keep your feet evenly in front of you. Its very much like how you would look if you sat in a really comfortable TV couch. You got to really throw your back into it and lean back, you know, stick the legs out.   Great right? Comfortable? Would you like a beer? Easy as pie yeah?  Fuck off.  That’s like the last thing I want to do. I’m looking down at the fifty or so feet and really, my body does not want to sit out and lean my very fragile and delicate spine out into the  air. I am pretty sure that tempting Newton‘s law to reach towards me and stifle the little insignificant flame of my life is a very bad idea.   “Hurry up lah Pondan!”, yells Saddam Jr.  Okay he did it. He threw down the gauntlet. I’m going to have to die now just to prove that I have balls.  As I go over, the image of a rope snapping and Goofy going “Ah...hoo hoo hoo” becomes a frightening reality. The first thing I notice is that as soon as the rock changes from horizontal to vertical, it gets a bit more slippery on account of lichen and moss.  There is another line running parallel to mine and another instructor is about halfway down the rock face on that line, assisting the Malay one on top with not much more than the insults at this point in time.  You control your descent using a rope that goes around your side. You pull this rope under your ass to brake. You pull it away from your ass to accelerate. I cannot even begin to imagine what those rock climbers are like, the ones who have no cables at all and just use a bag of chalk and climbing shoes and proceed to climb rock formations in Arizona.   I mean, I’m like SO thankful I have this here ass rope and some guy keeping me from becoming Asian flavoured Ritz bits.   What are people like French rock-climbing monkey-man thankful for ? Imagine being half way up Mt. Smashingpumpkin and maybe you get a little sleepy, or you remember you left the oven on, or suddenly you need to take a dump? Chalk has a lot of uses I guess but I don’t think that many.  How are you going to be thankful then?   I am repeatedly told that I don’t lean back enough. Its hard when your body locks up and refuses to do what your mind wants it to...   Mind: Erm, dude. You are going to have to assist me. I have to lean back more such that I can muster a stable footing on the rock wall. Can you help me?  Body: Ok let me get this straight. You want me to go against my natural instincts to purge all my waste deposits and throw my internal body balance to the wind and just lie back and you will “master” this hill of rock and stone?  Mind: Well... sorta. So how about it buddy? One for the team, bro? Body: Get fucked.   As a result, I do a mixture of both. I lean back but not enough, I am not truly upright yet not quite in the desired “L” shape. And so I begin to descend. Using my ass rope brake thingy I make it down slowly. My footing is unsure. There is no adventurous soundtrack to my struggle like in the movies. No big budget John Williams score and no pounding orchestra personifying my struggle of man against nature. All I hear is the creaking and popping of the rope, as it tightens and tauts with my descent. I assume these sounds are natural, but they freak me out nonetheless. My feet are at tip toes as I inch my way clumsily down the rock. The mynah birds call away in the distance. I make it about a third of the way down, when I’m stumped.   As it is my heart is already going like a spring bunny having sex. Below me there is a protrusion of rock, sticking out like a mound, and below that is a deep indentation with moss and undergrowth. This rock face is not very even at all. How am I to descend? I am scolded again and told to kick off the rock face and rappel down, SAS style. You have to be in that position where I am before you realise how difficult it is.   I decide to negotiate around the mound, to move to a flank and hopefully circumvent the whole ordeal of pushing off and ending up halfway below the mound and clocking my lights out on the resulting protrusion, which would hit me squarely in the face.  I take the first steps, pushing to the side. The rope groans but its okay. I take a while to gather my footing. I feel growing confidence, now the soles of my feet are in full contact with the rock face. Hmmm. Its not THAT bad I guess. I get around, almost round the side of the mound . I feel good. I have outsmarted the hardest part of the rock.  I am deliriously happy. I was worried most about the overhanging rock bit.  The rope suddenly cracks and whips me back to the centre. I had the rope pushed to one side and the force might have just been too much for me to keep at. Either that, or I suspect Saddam might have had something to do with my sudden loss of control. It doesn’t matter now, cause I have lost my footing and am hurtling right for the outcrop. I spin like a top, round and round.   Without footing you are aimless and thus I do all I can to prevent christening the rock with my bloodied teeth. I put my one free arm in front of me, the other holding on tightly to the ass rope. I slam into the rock. My arm stings and stars swim across my eyes. The instructors are shouting something but I cannot hear them. My fear has completely taken me over. My heart is going 300 miles per hour. And people below me on the ground, my other campmates are laughing. I can see them. Pointing up and laughing, nudging each other with knowing elbow jabs and winks. I would have loved it if all my pals would call out to me and encourage me instead of laughing at me and making jokes.  I am under no delusions. I knew this was going to be the only way I made it down. There is a very fine line between testing one’s limits and being stupid and getting owned. I can make any excuse I want for completely screwing up my attempt at abseiling. The truth however, is simple.   This is not who I am. I am not a wilderness survival combat junkie. I do not derive the pleasure that some get from climbing rock or jumping off a cliff or any of that crazy crap. Maybe there is a high from the activity, that I can understand. But knowing whether you are Tenzing Norgay or Average Joe Schmo has always been something I was familiar with. I know my limitations.  In a movie perhaps, I would have had some kind of “Mighty Ducks” moment where I gathered my resolve, tightened my belt and proceeded to abseil the rest of the way down head first, screaming “Freedom!” or something like that. But reality has no save game function.  I keep struggling downwards. My elbows and hands are bloodied from pushing off the rock. My watch face is smashed. I am completely out of my element here. The instructors are now shouting at me to just lay back so they can just lower me down easy.   I do not lay back. I end up in the brambles a couple of times, thorns and weeds scratching my skin and drawing more cuts and bruises. It is like  watching a kitten fight a pit bull terrier, sickening and without reward. Inch by inch I scrape, drag, and slaughter myself in order to get down.   Finally I reach the ground, falling in a tired heap. My knuckles and palms are bleeding, and sweat is streaming from every pore in my body. I feel no more celebration than the fact that I am on the ground again. I am tired and drained emotionally, and physically.  As an instructor undoes my gear, he takes the opportunity to give me the spiel about whether I found it great and exciting to successfully make it down or something like that.  Of course as he says this he knows that he does not truly believe what he is saying. I can see it in his eyes.  He and everybody saw the hill cane my ass, chewing me up, spitting me out and costing me a nice watch. It was the Mickey mouse one with the rotating hands.  Finally the gear comes off and I look up towards the face of the hill that beat me. I knew I had it coming. I knew I was not prepared for it. I knew I was going to lose. I took the hill on its terms and I got massacred. I was defeated and knew I was out for the count. I would have loved it if I could have actually taken the offer and let Saddam and the others baby me by stretchering me and letting me glide the rest of the way downhill. It would have saved me the embarrassment of further humiliation and mockery. Not to mention skin, blood and a decent watch. I am sure of it now. I am not an outdoors adventurer.  But if I have to go out, I’ll go out. Break my legs, crack my head open and slit my throat if you have to. I’m never going to go out like some punk bitch.   That is also something I am not either.
