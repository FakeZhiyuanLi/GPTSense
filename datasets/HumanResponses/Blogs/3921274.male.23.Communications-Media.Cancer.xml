      Didn't see it, as I was out doing other things (a friend's birthday and alcohol were involved), but I've read a majority of it from Kerry's website (availabe  urlLink here   if your interested). Later, I plan to watch the video they have of it as well.  Look for my comments on the speech after work and after my hangover goes away. So far, some quotes from the speech that really caught my eye were:   "We're told that outsourcing jobs is good for America. We're told that new jobs that pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost is the best we can do.  They say this is the best economy we've ever had.  And they say that anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist.  Well, here is our answer:  There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better."    "And as President, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to."   Impressive lines. Look for more later.

      That along with "John who?"  were the thoughts going through the mind of everyone in attendence at the Democratic Convention after Barack Obama spoke.  I have to agree.   Remember the name people, you'll be hearing a lot from him in the near future.

      Wow . . . that was incredible. The speech he just gave might have been even better than the one Clinton gave last night. The Democrats sent this young politician up to the plate in a big game and he responded by knocking the ball out of the park.  American, stand up and take notice. This guy is going places.   Update:  urlLink Here is a transcript  of the speech.

      You know, there's been a lot of talk that if John Kerry doesn't win in 2004, the Democrats will run Hillary Clinton in 2008. If I were the Democrats, I would go for broke and make  urlLink Barack Obama  her running mate.  That would make Hillary the first woman president and Obama the first black Vice-President.  Of course, we all know what Chris Rock said would happen if we ever had a black Vice-President.

       urlLink Here is a link  to a transcript of the incredible speech Bill Clinton gave last night at the Democratic Convention.  Quick side note: I'm note a total Clinton lover. I disagree with many of the things he did in office. But Clinton was the last big success the Democratic Party had and last night he showed he still mattered. That's why I'm so high on him right now.  Another side note: I'm by no means a rank and file Democrat. As I said before, I'm an indepedent. I feel the party during the Clinton Administration tried to be too much like the Republican party and during the Bush Administration did nothing to stop the havoc Bush reaped upon us and our constitution. However, I have aligned myself with the Democrats for this election because John Kerry is the best shot we have at beating Bush. And unfortantly, Bush must be defeated at all costs . . .

      My job sucks. I want a new one, but I don't have enough experience to get a new one just yet. It's kinda funny, 8 months ago I was on the brink of a breakdown cause I couldn't get a job. I was unhappy cause I was unemployed.   Now I am employed. And guess what? I'm still unhappy!! Does life really suck this bad or am I just one of those people who is never happy with anything in life?   Either way makes for a pretty shitty way to live your life!!  Coming Tomorrow: I rant on relationships, love, and marriage. Well I think it's coming tomorrow. As long as I don't find something better to do.

      Can Bill Clinton run for president again?   I know the answer to that rhetorical question, but man, the speech he gave tonight at the Democratic Convention was amazing. In under 25 minutes, Clinton layed out a clear political philosphy for the Democratic party, differentiated Kerry from Bush, and finally made the Democrates stand for something. In short, he did in 25 minutes what the Kerry campaign hasn't been able to do their entire campaign. These are the things the Democrats failed to do in 2000 and utimatly cost Gore the election.   Sure Clinton may have skeltons in his closet, but I still think if the Democrats want to beat Bush in 2004, they need to utilize Clinton to the fullest. Tonight was a shining example of how Clinton was able to captivate an American public and win 2 terms in the White House against a hostile Republican party ready to destroy the Clinton Administration at all costs.  Ronald Reagan, eat your heart out. Clinton is the real great communicator.

      I went to see the movie  Fahrenheit 9/11  on opening day. I found the movie brilliant, thought provoking, and extremely scary. As expected, the movie was met with harsh reviews from the usual suspects of right-wing, fact-less, you hate America cause you criticize the president pundits.  However, there was one review, written by Journalism Professor Robert Jensen, that really caught my eye. The reason? It was from a liberal, left-wing journalist who not only called Fahrenheit 9/11 a "bad movie", but also accused it of being conservative!!  The article (which can be found  urlLink here ) makes several interesting points about the movie that I think are at least worth considering (though I don't necessarily agree with most of them.) I could comment on the article line-by-line, but I prefer for people to read for themselves and decide on their own how they feel about articles such as these.  One part of the article I will comment on however, is this passage, which appears midway through the article   Is the administration of George  W. Bush full of ideological fanatics? Yes. Have its actions since  9/11 been reckless and put the world at risk? Yes. In the course  of pursuing those policies, has it enriched fat-cat friends?  Yes.  But it is a serious mistake  to believe that these wars can be explained by focusing so exclusively  on the Bush administration and ignoring clear trends in U.S.  foreign and military policy. In short, these wars are not a sharp  departure from the past but instead should be seen as an intensification  of longstanding policies, affected by the confluence of this  particular administration's ideology and the opportunities created  by the events of 9/11.   The statement is no doubt controversial and most likely confusing to those without any  background on the point of view people like Jensen hold. So allow me to provide some for you.  People like Jensen believe that since the end of World War 2, the United States has used it military not to defend our freedom or preserve our way of life, but instead to further US economic interests in countries which already lack a significant US economic presence.   For instance, Jensen would argue that the war in Iraq had nothing to do with liberating Iraqi citizens or protecting us from Saddam Hussein's supposed arsenal of "Weapons of Mass Destruction, but was instead waged to eliminate a regime that was hostile an American presence in their country and replace it with one much more receptive to American companies wishing to do business in the Middle East.  There is some evidence to support this claim. In 2000, a conservative think tank known as the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) released a report entitled  Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategy, Forces and Resources For a New Century   (the report, which is quite long, can be viewed  urlLink here ).  The report calls for an invasion of Iraq in order to remove the current regime and set up a base station "for a significant American Presence in the region."  It proposes gaining control of Iraq's oil resources not for economic reasons, as suggested by many anti-war protesters leading up to the war, but instead largely for the political purpose of maintaining control over the region.  After all, it quite obvious that the individuals in power in the Middle East are ones who control the oil reserves.   By gaining control of these oil reserves, the plan asserts, the United States could then gain significant political influence in the Middle East. By gaining political influence, we could then install a hand-chosen governmental regime that is favorable to US companies wishing to do business in the Middle East, but have thus far been unable to do sobecause of hostile governmental regimes.  What is even more startling about the plan is that the PNAC was produced for people like Vice-President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Rumsfeld's assistant at the Pentagon, Paul Wolfowitz is listed in the report as one of its authors.   People like Jensen would argue that plans such as the one mentioned above are nothing new and have been perpetrated by every Administration in the White House since World War 2.   Such ideas are worth considering in any worthwhile discussion of US foreign policy. I plan to write more on topics such as these in future posts. For now, enjoy the review and give Jensen's comments on US foreign policy a second thought. And by all means, go see Fahrenheit 9/11. You owe it to your country!

      This is my first attempt at blogging. Although I read many blogs throughout the day, up until a few weeks ago, I never really thought about writing a blog of my own. This came as a surprise to many people, seeing as I make my living designing websites. Whenever someone would ask why I didn't have a site, my response was always "I have nothing to say."   That, however, was extremely incorrect. The truth is, I have a lot to say about almost everything. After all, I'm an information junky. I read every book I can get my hands on. I watch at least 2 hours of TV a day. I spend at least an hour a day scouring the internet for what I consider the real news (not the McNews mainstream media sources.) Hell, I even listen to talk radio on occasion (yes I know, I am getting old!)  At some point during the process of absorbing all of this information, I tend to form strong opinions about the issues. Up until now, the only people I had to share my opinions with were friends. And let me tell you, listening to me rant about US foreign policy over beer at the local bar is not my friend's idea of a good time. So now I've turned to the internet as my vehicle for expressing my opinions.   So now perhaps a brief introduction of myself is in order. I am a 23 year old male graphic designer who lives alone. I am currently single and have many opinions about the current dating scene, many of which will appear on this site at some point.   I am a college graduate with a Degree in Mass Communications. I am very interested in media and the role it plays in our everyday lives. Someday, I plan on returning to college to obtain a masters and possibly a doctrine in the field. The media will be a major area of focus in my writings  I am also a political junky. I consider myself a political independent who is radically to the left on some issues but ridiculously to the right on others. Throughout the course of my blogging, you will learn about many of my views on a wide variety of political issues. As a quick taste, I consider George W. Bush one of the most dangerous presidents we have ever had.   But don't think this  blog will only be about media and politics. As I said before, I absorb a wide variety of information on a lot of subjects. What I write about will depend on what topic  or news items catches my interest on that particular day.  I plan to include a little bit of everything on this site.  Other than that, I would say my life is pretty ordinary. I go to work, I come home, I do some laundry, I watch some TV, and I go to bed. On the weekends and sometimes during the week, I enjoy going out with friends, having a few beers, and throwing a few games of darts. I don't have much luck with women, so I plan on being single for quite a while.  You will learn more about me as time goes by. I hope you enjoy this little experiment of mine. I welcome feedback, both negative and positive, on anything I write about.   Well thats all for now. Keep checking back for more. I'll talk to you soon, and please send me feedback on anything thats on your mind!!

      Yea, right and I'm a ten-foot green alien.  This courtesy of  urlLink Kos:    Since 2001, President Bush's tax cuts have shifted federal tax payments from the richest Americans to a wide swath of middle-class families, the Congressional Budget Office has found, a conclusion likely to roil the presidential election campaign.  The CBO study, due to be released today, found that the wealthiest 20 percent, whose incomes averaged $182,700 in 2001, saw their share of federal taxes drop from 64.4 percent of total tax payments in 2001 to 63.5 percent this year. The top 1 percent, earning $1.1 million, saw their share fall to 20.1 percent of the total, from 22.2 percent.  Over that same period, taxpayers with incomes from around $51,500 to around $75,600 saw their share of federal tax payments increase. Households earning around $75,600 saw their tax burden jump the most, from 18.7 percent of all taxes to 19.5 percent.   It's important to note that the agency conducting the study is a governmental agency working for a Republican congress. Furthermore, the agency is run by a Republican economist.  It never ceases to amaze me how people say they're Republicans cause they're poor and want to pay lower taxes. That just goes to show you the power of media and their ability to place partisan talking points into everyday discourse.  PS: If any of you Bushies read this and would like to try and explain this one, please leave a comment. I would love to hear your explainations.

      A post over at  urlLink This Modern World  tells of a threat to America far greater than Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction. And guess what, our so-called tough on terrorists, wartime president sees the whole thing as no big deal. I hope Americans wake up and vote the bastard out of office come November. You can read the post by clicking on the link above or if your lazy by clicking  urlLink here.

      Since Vice Presidential Candidate John Edwards was a trial lawyer before being elected to the Seneate, it's almost a given that Republicans will try and link Edwards to wide array of "frivelous lawsuits." One of the lawsuits featured will almost certainly involve the lady who was burned by a cup of coffee in a McDonalds drive-thru.  However, as  urlLink this article  illustrates, there was more to this famous story than meets the eye. Follow the link and keep the real story in mind when your assaulted with Republican attack ads in the months ahead.

      At least, that's what  urlLink some people  are saying. Appearantly, according to the various polles conducted following the Democratic Convention, the Kerry campaign has seen between a 4 point boost and a 5 point loss. These, are according to the polling sources, the lowest in the history of these polls.  However, as both  urlLink Atrios  and  urlLink Kos  pointed out, when you examine the internal workings of the polls, things get a bit fuzzy.   Apparently, according to the  urlLink USA Today poll  (which reported Kerry lost 5 points since the convention), 26% of those polls gave Kerry's convention speech a favorable rating. This is a higher approval rating than Bush's speech in 2000, which was so well recieved, it gave Bush a  17 point lead  over Al Gore in the polls.  It gets better. Apparently, the edge Bush held in his handling of the war on terrorism actually fell from 18% to 12%. Bush is selling the war on terrorism as the central issue of his campaign.  Something strange is going on here. Wonder if the polls were tabulated by the Flordia Election Commission.
