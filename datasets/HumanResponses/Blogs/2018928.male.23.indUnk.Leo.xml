      The easiest way to sort through  urlLink Kerry's Vietnam record . BTW, did you know he served in Vietnam?  I've liked Dan Radosh's PowerPoint presentations on Slate--being an idiot, he distills the complex and nuanced natures of matters as serious as  urlLink the 6 August PDB  and  urlLink the Pledge of Allegiance  into easily and one-hundred-percent accurate digestible format. Unfortunately, I haven't the foggiest how to work PowerPoint. I feel so deprived.

      Brilliant, brilliant rhetorical contorting by  urlLink Karen Hughes . I can see the campaign posters now, Tim: when you get a safe, legal abortion, you're with Osama.  Coming soon: 1. If you oppose repealing the estate tax, you oppose the war on terror 2. If you want Cheney to release the names of the 2001 energy policy meeting attendees, you want to set free Khalid Shaikh Mohammed 3. If you favor balancing the budget by supporting pay-go, you're donating money to Al Qaeda  Remind me again why I didn't do my thesis on political rhetoric?  (Hat tip:  urlLink Wonkette )

      The Specter-Toomey race goes to the polls today, and as of 8:45 a.m. the race is still neck and neck. Despite being someone who wouldn't mind seeing the GOP lose its Senate majority, I'm still pulling for Specter. In an age of political polarisation, the ballyhooed red-and-blue states having long become CW, it's worth finding and supporting those remaining moderates in politics.   Beyond the increasing gridlock in Washington, I've become more worried about the socio-philosophical ramifications of the polarisation. It's emblematic of a winner-take-all, scorched-earth mindset that's the guiding principle of both parties now. It's a trite observation, sure, but it's also true. This isn't to say that all centrists should be hailed as heroes--Exhibit A being John Breaux, who never met a big industry bill he didn't like--but increasingly, they're a rare breed. I'd still like to think of the average American as socially and economically moderate, but by dint of society splintering into hundreds of little ideological enclaves and the resulting pull on politics, that may no longer be the case.  More importantly,  I'm  socially liberal and fiscally moderate, so I'd rather see a Specter win more than a Toomey loss. The latter may be a red-hot poker to the eye of Steve Moore, but the former would be more appealing in the long run.

      Kaus critiques, vol. I (the important stuff first!)  Kaus cheap-shots Alexandra Kerry's now-infamous (and much-downloaded) Cannes appearance:   I guess Kerry really is writing off the South!... Hello? Do Americans want a first daughter who parades around in a dress Paris Hilton would be embarrassed to wear ? And shouldn't she have, you know, thought of that? Even if she looks good in it. ... P.S.: Could she be what these pictures suggest--a bit vain, selfish and opportunistic? John Kerry's daughter, of all people!   ... It's not clear to me that this dress would have much of a purpose if it wasn't intended to be seen through. But it would be very Kerry-like to blame her dresser! ....9:09 P.M.   Criticising Kerry (incessantly) is one thing. But to assail his 30-year old daughter at a movie premiere in Cannes? It's not low; it's just, well, silly. Moreover, Unfogged  urlLink has an explanation  (which, to his credit, Kaus links to).  Of all the things Kaus can critique, there are certainly better things than Kerry's daring and delectable daughter ... err ... what was I saying?

If he could present cogently his arguments against homosexuality, perhaps people would pay him more than a passing dismissal.

      Firstly, let's clear the air: conservatives arguing the 'imminent' threat meme re Iraq are playing ultra-pedantic/ -semantic cards. The administration may not have used the word 'imminent', but everything else they said sure as shit sounded like it.  But more to the point. The Weekly Standard's Barnes  urlLink takes a shot  at debunking Iraq myths. Unfortunately, he's as reductive in his responses as some of those he argues against.  Take his view of de-Baathification. What he neglects to mention, of course, is that a)  urlLink Chalabi's in charge of it  and settling old scores and that b) much of it was far too zealous as to have been effective, that it barred many soldiers, bureaucrats and teachers from taking jobs initially because they were party members. Never mind that it was purely to attain/keep a job without necessarily espousing Baath ideology.  He's fairly wrong about the army's disbanding too. The main impact of disbanding wasn't an averting of civil war between it and the Shia and Kurds, but the letting loose hundreds, if not thousands of trained, armed and disaffected men loose, free to forge and merge into insurgent groups. Perhaps Falluja would have been better served by having an indigenous security force (and here the sort of precise and comprehensive de-Baathification process outlined above would have been more helpful). But again, Barnes is beating up a straw man.  His last two points aren't disproved yet, and I'd hope that Sadr doesn't resurface and that Iraq is winnable. But the sort of blithe dismissal of worst-case scenario planning, or any alternatives consideration, is precisely what may lead the US to failure.

      Sorry, I just haven't been up to blogging lately.  Jonathan Last says that  urlLink Bush was overreacting  in apologising to the Iraqis and to the Arab world and, by extension, the world (including treacherous France and Germany) for Abu Ghraib. To do so, Last argues, is to treat Iraqis and Arabs paternalistically, as though they are small children who have to be told that this was done by only a few bad men. He contrasts this to American reaction to the desecrations of four contractors at Fallujah, where public opinion saw the vile acts as the perpetrations of a handful of people.   But I think Last errs on several counts. The public was right in forcing Bush to apologise because unlike the Iraqis, American forces are under the rubric of fighting to freedom and democracy. This doesn't excuse Fallujah, but it does put an extra onus on the US to ask for forgiveness when atrocities of this magnitude emerge. What the MPs, intelligence officers and whoever else was involved did was nothing less than completely contrary to the principles American forces are pledged to uphold and spread. Those acts have irrevocably damaged the war on terror and compromised America's higher moral ground. So whatever acts needed to be done to salvage that rightness needed to be done.  And I may be remembering incorrectly, but I remember at least a few people (well, bloggers, but they're nominally people too) who thought Fallujah was another signifier of Islam's obsession with death: the Sunni less so than the martyr-centred Shia, perhaps, but still a culture that upholds and applauds suicide bombings against Israelis. But maybe Last is suffering from amnesia as well.  UPDATE:  urlLink Derbyshire posts on the same subject , though only as Derb can. I'm not even going to bother commenting; his words speak for themselves.

      Whoop-ti-doo, I am officially the least tech-savvy person heading to NYU next year, because I'm making my first blog post from a wireless location. Aren't I cool? So instead of being cooped up in my room, logging in via ancient dialup, I'm enjoying (almost) free Internet access from the comfort of a cushy chocolate-coloured easy chair in Emory Village.  However, despite this innovation supposedly allowing people to be more social while computing, I'm not seeing it. I'm still engaging in the physically solitary activity that is blogging, as well as checking my e-mail and surfing the Web. I suppose in the sense that one is surrounded by others, wireless Internet makes computing more social. But I'm not sure if it's more depressing surging the Web at home by yourself, or being surrounded by a gaggle of people whose eyes are invisibly glued to their laptop screens.

      Upon reflection, this is probably the most emotional Aimee Mann gets. She still has an air of reserve about her singing, but the music and her insistent phrasing make her version a more urgent affair than the original. Chris Martin, as always, seems content to leave his song in languor, the wistful dream of times past by, well, an English singer of a certain modern millieu. The drums in the Mann version strike ever so more authoritatively; the guitar rings a bit more urgently. And she raises her voice and speeds the tempo, puts a bit more desperation into the song.  On its own, such urgency wouldn't make the song interesting, and Martin sings like there's a fire under his ass on 'Green Eyes' and 'In My Place'. But Mann's voice, unlike Martin's, is naturally flat (not in terms of tune, but in terms of intonation), leading in large part to the 'ice queen' reputation with which Christgau and Greil Marcus have slapped on her. She is the observer and the wronged party in much of her own material, but there she takes on an aggrieved air much of the time that can be a real mood-dampener. Here though, she actually wants what she has lost, tries analysing what led to it and calls back to it. It embodies the tension in the song better than Martin's more abstract, and probably more ineffectual, original. It's the sound of an icy, naturally distant person trying to cross an unbridgeable gap and take back what s/he once had. It's the drama inserted and defined where it never existed.

      So it's been a bit of while since I last posted--not that I really had or have an audience for this blog--but I figure I must as well as do a Clinton and do a diary dump.  A lot of people have asked me with some regularity over the past month if something's wrong with me. That I seem a bit more sullen and quiet lately. They might be right, but if they're asking that, then I'm both succeeding and failing: I'd like to both have the attention of people attending to me, and to not have people ask, because that's only an imposition on others. Perhaps that's a bit passive-aggressive. No one has explicitly asked me to stop.  There's little doubt that most people need at least some social attention from time to time, to avoid withering and dying. Many are misanthropes who claim to get by, of course, but somehow it seems that social contact really is a blessing and a curse, if it's permitted free reign in someone's psyche. It shouldn't be news to anyone that seeking anyone's approbrium is something akin to a psychological disorder, but it tends to happen, for a variety of reasons. It's probably the residue of the perpetually needy--be they actors, ex-presidents, or fat kids who ... but that's enough blubbering. At the least, the realisation that there's a problem should be an auspicious start. Of course, it's what one does with it that counts, and untreated, the damn thing metastasizes and grows out of control. It's a cliche. But I'm not in the mood to come up with original thought--another of my faults, I suppose.  One thing I've been curious about is those relationships where in addition to the support normally found in functioning relationships, there's also a sort of one-upsmanship. The clashing of two Type-A personalities. What of two Type As who dream of being the best, but don't have the wherewithal to achieve that? That's a formula for an interesting character study, the continuation of Miller's  Death of a Salesman , the echt American anti-tragedy tragedy (though Beckett would probably lay claim to the greatest un-Aristotelian tragedian status). And maybe that sort of thing manifests itself not just overtly, but also covertly--the individuals who strive ultimately for their own happiness, or work harder than the other to make the other happy. Ill-read illiterate I am, I can't remember the thinker who posited that relationships fundamentally make people unhappy, but perhaps they do. Dependent on the mindset, of course.  On a slightly more honest note: Aimee Mann does a fantastic cover of Coldplay's 'The Scientist' on the second disc of  Lost in Space . Rather than Chris Martin's familiar, vaguely wan searching voice, Mann's more distant, dispassionate vocals seem to fit the mood of the song a bit more. She fits the role of the eponymous scientist better, thinking of the past, or perhaps the abstract. It dessicates the song's emotional content, stripping the easy sentimentality of the original. And in doing so, it makes the song somehow more affecting.

If 'This is love' doesn't get your blood and your hormones flowing, doesn't remind you of the room-spinning feelings of giddiness and horniness and abandon of the rush of first love, intoxicated or not, apprehensive or not, but rushing into it anyway, you're not thinking, and you're not feeling.

      It's kind of odd surfing on Friendster, doing the equivalent of Googling people you know, and coming across an old flame. Of course, she's in a new relationship, and she seems to be doing really well. Good for her. Don't know how to take her being out of school and moving about again, but hey, who am I to criticise her?    In that sense, I guess, Friendster can be useful as a means of remaining linked to a person, though it's only incrementally better than not corresponding at all. After all, simply being linked to someone without actually talking/writing to them on a regular basis isn't much good at all, and sometimes it seems like it's as though you can't let go. Still, I suppose the fact that you can resume that line of communication is an overall advantage, however slim.    As a means of finding common ground with someone else, I think Chuck Klosterman was right in that it's such a superficial means of finding others--we both dig Modest Mouse? Rockin'! But isn't that how we usually meet and get to know people in the real world in the first place? It's using pop culture as shorthand for personality and temperament, which is what we pretty much do nowadays, and is part of the beauty of its deceptively powerful symbolism.     At the same time, however, it's also very easy to fall into the self-segregation, splintering, polarising impetus that Davids Broder and Brooks (and everyone else, for that matter) complains about. Why would a Cure fan need to hang out with a Metallicahead when s/he could just hook up (and hook up) with other Robert Smith acolytes, to say nothing of, say, Dems and GOPers? There will always be people who consciously seek out those opposite their preferences and philosophies, and those who accept people of all cultural/sociopolitical stripes. But in this day and age, that might be increasingly the exception.    This begs the question, then: as communication and information technologies advance ten- and hundred-fold and the global community becomes tighter- and tighter-knit, are we doomed to splinter into ever-smaller, more closely knit and exclusionary tribes? I wish I could definitively say 'no', that everyone will be welcomed into a bigger tent, that information will spread more freely, that there will be more understanding and comity. So far, though, that doesn't seem to be happening. Like seeks like, and when that groups get concentrated in their beliefs, they defend them with more fervor and tend to see their core commonalities as sacrosanct, and therefore defensible to the death.     I'd love to be proven wrong. I just haven't seen any contrary evidence at this point.

      What is the secret to blogging, or at the least writing, on a regular  basis? It feels like--nay, has been--ages since I last wrote something.  I'd hope it's not from lack of ideas, though that's a distinct  possibility.   I'm preparing, ever so slowly, to move back up north, and only now is  the full import of that action hitting me. I've spent four years down  in Atlanta now, and moving away from people I've known and loved is  only now starting to seem so big. Of course, many of them are moving  too, so it's only the natural progression of things. When I sit down  and think about it, I'm wary of the consequences; this is the biggest  move I've had to make since coming to Atlanta in the first place (I  knew the UK was a time-delimited adventure).   Of course, apartment-hunting is taking forever and then some. Here's to  hoping some actual hard work can couple with my usual good luck to  finding a place. Preferably on the Island, a studio for less than a  grand. That'd be nice. If not essential, but whatever.   End of part one of a probably multi-part post.

      Sully argues that the  urlLink lib media picked on Jack Ryan's 'consensual adult sex'  and decried it as another rape of privacy. But the point was that  urlLink it wasn't consensual . Per Jeri 'Smokin' Cyborg/Too Hot Teacher' Ryan:   On three trips, one to New Orleans, one to New York, and one to Paris, Respondent [Jack Ryan] insisted that I go to sex clubs with him. They were long weekends, supposed "romantic" getaways. ... The clubs in New York and Paris were explicit sex clubs. Respondent had done research. Respondent took me to two clubs in New York during the day. One club I refused to go in. It had mattresses in cubicles. The other club he insisted I go to. ... It was a bizarre club with cages, whips and other apparatus hanging from the ceiling. Respondent wanted me to have sex with him there, with another couple watching. I refused. Respondent asked me to perform a sexual activity upon him, and he specifically asked other people to watch. I was very upset. We left the club, and Respondent apologized, said that I was right and that he would never insist I go to a club again. He promised it was out of his system. Then during a trip to Paris, he took me to a sex club in Paris, without telling me where we were going. I told him I thought it was out of his system. I told him he had promised me we would never go. People were having sex everywhere. I cried, I was physically ill. Respondent became very upset with me, and said it was not a "turn on" for me to cry.   I honestly don't know where Sully takes offence. He previously argued that  urlLink one difference between Clinton and Arnold  was that the former's transgressions were already in the public domain (via lawsuits). Jack and Jeri Ryan's divorce proceedings were a public artefact, although one that was under court seal.  Ultimately, I'm not sure of where exactly the defining line is regarding public officials' privacy. I still believe that Clinton's offences were execrable, but Republican efforts to abuse the special prosecutor's office to partisan effect were equally, if not more, dangerous.  urlLink Arnold's case is slightly muddier , since none of the allegations made it to court, though the women claimed, not implausibly, that bringing the then-highest paid action star in the planet to the docket was a futile task. Now, Arnold did apologise where Clinton did not. Fine. And he didn't commit these acts as a public servant--and more specifically did not use public services for private gain. OK. But the allegations still sound serious enough that even after the fact should have been investigated.  Ryan's case wasn't investigated as a crime, but as a civil procedure, which puts him somewhere between Clinton and Schwarzenegger. Moreover, the events happened during a marriage, and the revelation at divorce proceedings, where emotions do run high. (See also Blair Hull's downfall, though that involved allegations of physical abuse.) But this doesn't exculpate Ryan if they're true. Did they render him unfit for office? That's a big question. Should we plumb about people's personal histories to determine that? That's a bigger question, and one I'll probably return to later.

      Many are wondering what the hell is up with John McCain.  One minute he's  urlLink praising  the Democrats then the next, he's  urlLink strongly going out  for Bush. Why all this ups and downs? Sure, McCain is probably being a geniune politician no doubt.. but I think there is more than that. I think McCain still harbors dreams of being President and he's seeing his opening.  McCain realizes that while he could defeat Bush in 2004, by joining up with Kerry, he'd still have to be Kerry's VP (and chances are if Kerry wins in 2004, he won't be making a comeback in 2008.but that's for a later blog).  McCain also realizes that Kerry may well not need him to defeat Bush...Kerry may do it on his own as the stealth candidate as  urlLink Morris  puts it. I bet.. that McCain thinks this:  1).  if Kerry wins, I can run in 2008 (sure I'll be 72 but Reagan wasn't that far in age from me and I'm still in great health).  I'll run as a uniter after 4 years of Kerry pissing off Republicans. I'll say that Americans earn for a uniting leader as they did with Ronald Reagan and I'm the guy that can do it.  I'm a loyal republican who fought hard for Bush in 2004, but I'm also someone that Democrats loved so much that they wanted me as their running mate.    2). If Bush wins, he will have ended up polarizing so much of the electorate that Jeb Bush will have a tough time winning the nomination.  Frist and the others won't excite the independent and Republican base like me.  And I also get a chance to get a bit even with the  urlLink Bushies for their behavior in SC in 2000.     McCain is a smart man.and though he'll be old (he'll be 80 when his two-terms are done if he were elected in 2008) but being 80 is getting a wholle new meaning.    Get those bumperstickers ready..McCain/Guiliani 2008!!

      Oxblog's David Adesnik posted Saturday that it would be scary if the terrorists who had decapitated Paul Johnson, Danny Pearl and, maybe soon, the Korean hostage  urlLink learned to simply release their prisoners . That way, they demonstrate their moral superiority to the infidel westerners.  But this strikes me as based on a false premise. Without exception, these terrorist groups' Wahabbist beliefs compel them into an apocalyptic mindset where they can take no quarter and must achieve absolute victory. To cede any mercy would violate their particular interpretation of the Qu'aran.  Moreover, showing mercy wouldn't benefit their cause. Presumably, the majority of the Muslims whose support the terrorists want to gain wouldn't take kindly to such kindliness. They'd rather have a dispensation of 'justice' than any sort of leniency. And most Americans wouldn't be swayed by acts of mercy; they would be relieved that one of their own is coming home safely, but they wouldn't think any more kindly of thugs who kidnap Americans and treat their lives as dispenable. (I'd cite  urlLink Thomas Hamill , but he escaped rather than was let go.) Now those on the extremes may use that as some sort of pretext for discontinuing any actions against terrorists, or for leaving Iraq/Saudi Arabia/Afghanistan, but the majority of Americans in general would still seethe with rage at having one of their own put in such a perilous position.  With both sides so polarised and there being little room for moderates, the process has become a zero-sum game. Obviously, that's to be expected when both sides declare war and call for the eradication of the other, in the starkest terms, with the harshest methods.

      To followup on my previous post regarding a 269-269 tie, I'll point out that I believe the Presidential race is decided in the House (Bush will win) but the VP selection I believe is decided in the Senate.  Mmm...its in doubt if Cheney could win re-election there. Thus, we could possibly see Bush and someone else as his VP.  NOw there's a marriage made in heaven.

      Juan Williams, a columnist whom I respect, has come out with an  urlLink article  that is quite interesting.  This article basically says that Bush can win as much as 20% of the black vote.  This is because Kerry, according to Williams, "has done a poor job of reaching out to black voters."  And also because "Mr. Kerry has rarely been identified with issues that compel black voters — notably affirmative action."    First, I will say that Juan is right on several things.  African-American voters do back school choice. On things such as the homosexuality/gay marriage, faith based initatives, religion, prayer in school, and other culturally conservative issues, blacks and conservative GOPers probably are in lock step.  On the homosexuality/gay marriage issues, blacks seem even more  urlLink anti gay lifestyle than whites do. Even with all this evidence and support, Juan is wrong to think Bush will get more than 13% (and even that's a stretch) in this election. Beyond the fact that  urlLink some 73%  of blacks oppose the Iraq War and black unemployment is back into double digits under Bush, there are just some issues and perceptions that Republicans do not overcome because they pride themselves on them.    Bush prides himself on winning nearly 30% of the black vote in his 1998 governor's race in Texas, but its rarely mentioned that he won only five  urlLink 5%%%%%  of the black vote in TEXAS in his race for President..not a ringing endorsement.  Bush nationally got anywhere between 8 and 10% of the black vote,depending on which exit polls you choose to believe.  Though Juan says Bush should tout the blacks he has appointed to major positions, i'd say he should do the opposite.  There is nothing more patronizing and irritating than to have Republicans and Bush bring out Condi Rice/Colin Powell/JC Watts whenever their racial intentions are questioned.  Colin Powell and Condi Rice are in their positions because they are the most qualified (which Republicans are  urlLink adamant  to point out), yet when time comes to defend Bush, they say "well look Bush has appointed black people to high positions."  They don't seem to realize the contradiction, but African-Americans sure do.  By anwering the "What have you done for black people" question with "well I appointed some"..you imply that Condi Rice and Colin Powell are not there FOR their talents (which Republicans profess that they are), but for their race.    Bush and Republicans shouldn't point them out.its quite obvious that they are black.  Another answer to a "What have you done for blacks" question is "well uh..I care about Africa..and I take  urlLink pictures with black people..that's compassion."    Sadly, blacks in America care about as much about Africa as whites in America do.  When Bush speaks before largely black audiences, for some reason, he focuses on Africa as if blacks somehow will go "ohh that's soo awesome..finally someone who cares about um..those poor people over there."  The only black people who care about Africa (and this is in all honesty) are blacks in the elite classes and they are no more likely to vote for Bush than vote for a sock puppet.    Hell Bush might as well stick to his original script and  urlLink continue calling Africa a country  for all black and white Americans care.  My caveat to this of course is that we should be extremely concerned about Africa infinitely more than we are today.  I am happy and proud of President Bush for taking interest (and some  urlLink argue FAR more interest than Clinton ) in Africa.  With that said though, a sad and astonishing amount of Americans don't care much about the contient.  Bush should care and shows he cares about Africa as a matter of national and global concern.  My advice:  Talk about Africa to the white groups; talk about the economy to the black groups.  This is one reason why Republicans lose among blacks in the perception game.   Another reason is not necessarily the Republican views, but their actions.  If elections among blacks were strictly decided by the views of each party, I'd imagine Republicans would come out winning more than a paltry 9% considering the role and power of the black church.  Case in point:  Affirmative action.  There is much debate among blacks regarding affirmative action and its role.  Affirmative action for blacks (particularly) in college is more than an issue of policy, it is an issue of pride, an issue of honor, and an issue of respect.  For College Republicans to say to the black students of their campus:  "No offense, but you aren't qualified to be here with me"..how else are blacks suppose to respond but in anger and indignation.    Republicans oppose preferences.  I'm not too crazy about them myself, but they must be strong in opposing ALL preferences.  REpublicans say this is a matter of fairness, not a matter of race, yet it is not the blacks or the Democrats that make it a matter of race.  If Republicans want to win on this issue and convince blacks, then they should come out an oppose equally all preferences (legacies, affirmative actions, sports, etc.)  urlLink Their  focus on racial preferences makes it a racial issue and therefore African Americans feel insulted not only by their focus on race, but by their perceived hypocrisy in not focusing on preferences that may have helped them.    Bush himself maybe a sincere and honest man, but he leads a party where  urlLink Trent Lott  wishes Strom Thurmond had won the election of 1948 and  urlLink Rush Limbaugh  out of nowhere says Donovan McNabb is only liked because he's black.  Yes, Bush  urlLink repudiated,  quite strongly Lott's remarks, but that something like that would even come out of a national officials mouth in the year 2002 is amazing.  Yes, Democrats have had a long history of being the party of outright racists (George Wallace, and just about every Southern Democrat..hell Trent Lott and Strom Thurmond started out as Democrats), but could you imagine these words coming out of the mouth of Tom Daschle or any Democrat in this day and age?  (Yes yes, I know that Robert Byrd (D-WV) said  urlLink white niggers/was a Klansman  and Chris Dodd (D-CT) later  urlLink praised  Byrd.  But in the perception battle, neither Dodd nor Byrd have or would get attention.  That is unfair, but that is life.  Republicans should know that in the perception battle, they must hold themselves to a higher standard (just as the perception battle, Clinton and Third Way Democrats had to be far more centrist).   The one big fat reason why Juan is wrong and why Bush will not get no more than 10-12% of the black vote is Florida Florida Florida as Tim Russert said.  African-Americans have never forgiven Bush and Republicans for what they perceived to be a stolen election.. Not just a stolen election but an election stolen because of black disenfrancishment. Again, reality in this situation does not matter, elections and voting are about perceptions.  No matter how many times I tell my mom that Bush didn't steal the election, her perception and the perception of  urlLink many blacks  is that he did. Bush lost any chance to improve his black vote totals for 2004, back in 2000.    Its weird to imagine, but blacks were once the stalwarts of the Republican Party.  Even though history looks poorly on characters such as Warren G. Harding and Henry Cabot Lodge, they were among the first white political leaders to condemn lynching and the Klan while Woodrow Wilson, the great liberal hero, was busy  urlLink segregating the federal government    and praising the racist  urlLink Birth of a Nation .    Even during the Depression (1932) the majority of blacks voted for Herbert Hoover and the Party of Lincoln.  Even after FDR won over black voters, Republicans such as Wendell Wilkie (1940) and Thomas Dewey (1944,1948) garnered near 30% of the vote.   urlLink Dwight Eisenhower won nearly 40% of the black vote in 1952, 1956 and Richard Nixon in 1960 won an amazing 32% of the black vote.   For a little more history of the black vote go  urlLink here . Since Goldwater got his 3% of the black vote in 1964 on his anti Civil Rights agenda, blacks have only voted Republican on average 10-12%.    It seems only huge, watershed moments in history change the black vote in dramatic fashion. Bush probably had that moment with September 11th, but slowly let that slip away.  Unless Bush and Juan Williams know some secret that Juan hasn't already laid out in this article, then the Republicans should concentrate on winning the  urlLink white vote.  .  Perception and reality are two different things. This was an outline of why blacks won't vote for Bush. But should they?  That's for a later blog.

      Soo. our new Middle Eastern tryant "buddy" is turning out to be much like our old Middle Eastern tyrant buddy.  Apparently, Mr. Khaddaffi wanted to kill the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in order to  urlLink stir up the pot.   Though the caveat is that IF this is true, it happened last year.  But even if it did happen last year, it shows the folly of putting our trust in tyrants and dictators. It never ceases to amaze me how our country lives by such overt contradications.  In one breadth a President will say "I wanna bring peace and democracy to the Middle East but pretty much at the expense of everyone else."  Outside of blanket press releases, do you think Bush or Kerry would challenge Russia on democracy? How about Saudi Arabia?  urlLink What of Iran electing a new hardline parliment largely because of what's going on in Iraq?  Egypt? Pakistan? China? Chad perhaps? What of the ruthless murders in  urlLink Darfur?    We will do nothing and say nothing because frankly, we are living in one giant contradiction of policy.  WE allow ruthless warlords to run wild in Afghanistan, we turn a blind eye to ruthless Middle Eastern thugs and hell keep them in power through military support though these actions clearly give Bin Laden a leg to stand on.  And yet we find ourselves holding the proverbial wolves by the ears as Thomas Jefferson said of slavery. We can't let the wolf go because he'd kill us, but surely we don't have the strength to keep holding him.  We cannot allow our tyrant friends in  Pakistan or Saudi Arabia or perhaps even Egypt to be replaced by "democracy" because if the people had their vote, they'd probably replace them with someone  urlLink we realllly wouldn't like.     What I'd give for a President to go to China and say "you tyrants, you evil, immoral men, as surely as freedom and hope prospers in the hearts of men and women, your days are numbered." But this will never come because our nation must coddle dictators and in doing so, we come across as hypocrites and it encourages anti-Americanism in these nations.  Tough dillemmas. So will Khaddafi actually face some sort of punishment for this? Not likely.  Since we based our war in Iraq on the premise of "weapons of mass destruction", all Khaddafi had to do was give up his weapons and we gave him a blank check to continue his dictatorship.  then again, I suppose we did try to  urlLink kill him.

      Howdy!      Well Mikers you are correct in that there has been some recent polling data showing both Arkansas and West Virginia turning some shades of blue.  The Mason-dixon West Virgina poll shows Kerry leading 47-41% which is pretty odd considering that Mason-Dixon is a reliably accurate poll that leans ever so slightly toward the Republicans.  Arkansas's polls have been up and down but the most recent Rasmussen robo poll has Bush winning the state.  What's interesting about the West Virginia poll is that if it is true, its a reverse coattails effect. The Democratic Governor candidate, Joe Manchin is hugely popular and Democrats run West Virginia.  As a historical point, before Bush, no first time Republican had won the state since wayy back in 1920 with Warren G. Harding. Hell this state voted for Michael Dukakis for Godssakes.  Perhaps 2000 was a fluke. Whatever the cause, if things hold up like they are now, we are looking folks at a 269-269 electoral college split!! How do I figure this? well if the most recent polls are to believed, the only states that would switch would be NH and WV for Kerry meaning that the two sides would split it.  If the most recent national polls (Zogby/Gallup/Rasmussen) are to be believed, then Kerrry would once again win the popular vote.  This mark 16 years since Republicans won the popular vote. While I'd find this result funny, I'm guessing there will be your standard fair riots in the streets!    What's far more interesting is that the most recent Gallup poll showing Kerry leading overlapped with news of Reagan's death.  The Rasmussen robo polls have also overlapped.  Right now, the most popular President of the second half the century has died, the economy is booming, jobs are growing, and Iraq is marginally stablizing, yet most Americans still think the war was not worth it and they STILL think Bush has done a crappy job on the economy.  The perception is the problem. It took many months to cement these negative feelings among Americans and it'll take many more to beat it out of them.  Furthermore, its much harder to make a negative into a positive. I'm interested to see what the polls make of Bush after reagan's funeral. If the numbers haven't budged, then this election may not even be a perception battle.  It may well be that 46% of Americans on both sides have made up their mind and would vote for a sock puppet before voting for the other guy.  I still believe the election will be a marginal landslide either way, but for right now, we're looking at a split country.

      Via OxBlog,  urlLink this  shows an electoral map based on current polling data. Yet the map's data is sourced from The Hedgehog Report, which if anything shows both Ohio and Pennsylvania still tipping Kerry's way. Moreover, recent polling data (which I can't find--Chris, help!, to be said Wes Clark-style) suggested WV and Arkansas dipping their toes into blue.  If anyone can suggest a comprehensive collection of polls online, I'd be much obliged.

      As the first discursive post on the blog, I'm cribbing from and adding to an e-mail I sent Chris yesterday.  Mike Rappaport guest-blogs in The Volokh Conspiracy, and  urlLink proclaims Reagan the greatest prez of the 20th century . Now, everyone is entitled to his opinion, but Rappaport goes further:   ... The only competitor is Franklin Roosevelt, who gets credit for leading the country during World War II and for helping the US persevere through the Great Depression. But Roosevelt's accomplishments were marred by his enormous failures, including significantly expanding government control of the economy, undermining traditional constitutional restraints, failing to actually end the economic downturn until World War II, and not appreciating the dangers of Soviet Communism.   By contrast, Reagan's accomplishment were tremendous in both the domestic and foreign spheres, and  they were not undermined by any significant failures  (emphasis added).    So then Beirut, Iran-Contra, SDI (which added tremendously to the federal deficit, led to even greater tensions with the USSR, and was based on completely bunk science), the Meese commission, trebling federal deficits, and the de-funding of Superfund sites don't count as failures? Of course, I could redirect you to David Corn's  urlLink list of problems  with Reagan, but I'm sure others have before me.  Now, this isn't to make my take on Reagan nearly as vitriolic as  urlLink Hitch's . Communism did end under his watch, and he was right to recognise the inherent moral and pragmatic bankruptcy of the Soviet Union; whether that was because of internal rot and Reagan's initation of a devastating arms race or Reagan's 'evil empire' tough rhetoric remains an open question. Too many liberals throughout the Cold War seemed inclined to give the Kremlin too much of the benefit of the doubt. But, say,  urlLink Dinesh D'Souza's effusive encomium  to Reagan also seems to be giving the man too much credit in terms of devising a detailed and bold vision in ending the Communist threat. The end of one of the most brutal regimes in human history came about from an endlessly and comprehensively thought-out game plan drummed out by a man aides widely acknowledged had little tolerance for the nit-picky of policy and delegation to the extreme?

      Per Stephanie Cutter:    "'He is a riveting speaker,' she said. Furthermore, she argued, it's a 'really good speech' and one that he wrote (longhand, on yellow legal pads) — so he will 'knock it out of the park.'" (Today's  urlLink The Note )    Why? Because he's set to speak for  50  or  55  (  cinquante  ou   cinquante-cinq ) minutes. Now, if Kerry wants to reclaim the long-lost art of political oratory, that's one thing; that's an admirable goal, one whereby great orators from Aristotle to Longinus to Aquinas to Elizabeth to Franklin to Lincoln to FDR to Kennedy have succeeded. However, Kerry isn't a good speaker like them, doesn't have the natural affinity or curiosity of language they have. And unfortunately, as  urlLink this blast-from-the-TNR past  points out, today's audiences don't have the stomach (or the means) to appreciate such older rhetoric.    I need to find my Adderol before tonight.

      1. I kind of wish I had seen  Teddy  speak, if only for sentimental reasons. But by all accounts, he was not that impressive and off his game.    2.  Dean  was surprisingly dull, a shadow of his former self. Perhaps Bill Richardson and the Powers That Be told him to tamp down his energy and anger for a national audience; if so, then it's both a positive and a negative that he's a team player now. But it also suggests that a) the only real use he has for the DNC is his access to his e-mail list and his ability to corral bleeding hearts from Nader's camp, and b) maybe he didn't really have all that much to say in the first place, aside from 'the war is bad' and his Internet fundraising.    3. Let's not mince words:  Obama  has arrived. A young, dynamic speaker who impressed even  urlLink Sully  with his centrist rhetoric. For a guy whose rep is as a classic big-gov liberal, he voiced impressive themes of self-reliance that doesn't come at the expense of community, of uniting the disparate tribes in American culture and not turning differences into divisions, of protecting the troops from those who'd shade the truth to suit their purposes.     Don't get me wrong. Much like  urlLink Will Saletan , I was supremely bothered by Obama's raising of the outsourcing bogeyman, a meme that's wound its way throughout the Democratic platform and a sign of lazy political thinking. But on the whole, Obama demonstrated an energy and an ability to connect with the people. He's not there yet; getting elected and establishing a national record comes first. So does demonstrating this new commitment to a centrist platform. But I think Toni Morrison should consider taking back the title of 'black president' and giving it to Obama in a couple of years.    Of note: C is impressed by Obama. That augurs well for him.    4. I'll admit my laziness yet again. I didn't care all that much about watching  Teresa  speak (I was finding my way to the bottom of my bottle of rye). I had her speech playing in the background, and she seemed to talk about herself and her beliefs, when she's not running for office. Not that I prefer the Laura Bush's model. But THK isn't someone whom I'm voting for come November.

      A couple of points:    Bush was never particularly bipartisan in Texas. He reached out to Democrats mostly because the Texan governorship has far less executive power than most states'. Any sense of comity was forced, not naturally springing. I don't think Karla Faye Tucker's fate comes from a man who believes in compromise.    Furthermore, Cheney has been notably silent on one of Bush's most salient wedge attempts: the Federal Marriage Amendment. Lynne Cheney has spoken out against the FMA, following Cheney's simple statement that he follows the presidential directive. No ringing endorsement, and how can he, with his daughter Mary an increasingly public figure?    What it seems more like is that Cheney is the attack dog rather than the main mover for a divisive, partisan attack. Karl Rove (the originator of the Bush as war president meme) seems more to have chosen Dick as the public face of the uglier sentiments and attacks the White House wishes to pursue, rather than the other way around. Remember that in 2000, Bush could have chosen a different tactic against the more moderate McCain; instead, he went for a scorched-earth counter-attack that people still talk about today.     Moreover, Cheney started out as a more moderate type, at least when he was under the tutelage of his one-time boss, the (surprisingly!) moderate Republican raider Don Rumsfeld, Ford's chief of staff. Of course, as he progressed through the levels of government, he developed his more conservative side, as he became encsconced in the nascent Goldwater wing of the party. If you have the time, search out Wyl Hilton's profile of Rumsfeld and Cheney from 2000 in Esquire, where you can gain a greater sense of what drove Cheney (and to a lesser extent, the enigmatic Rumsfeld).    Fine. But what if Cheney were replaced? Conceivably, some members of Bush's base would be enraged, seeing it as a sign of weakness and (heaven forfend) moderation. But whom could Bush plausibly tap to be his vice-president? Certainly not McCain, who, despite his kind words a month ago doesn't feel any great sympathy for Bush. Giuliani wouldn't sully his newly minted reputation as America's Mayor by a) becoming subservient with a campaign, and b) even associating himself with as controversial and negative a campaign as Bush's. Rudy's energy would be better served, he must surely reason, by trying to knock out Hillary, or amassing a war chest to beat his rival Pataki. And let us rule out Colin Powell, whose reputation has been shattered by the events of the past year, and whose natural instinct is revealed ever more as self-preservation above all. The only plausible and more moderate choice, then, would be Condi Rice, herself a lightning rod of controversy whose perch on the pedestal of public opinion has been battered by the 9/11 Commission.    Otherwise, Bush doesn't have much choice in picking a more palatable running mate. And since he and Rove seem to have cast their lot with their base (and the supposed 4m evangelicals who stayed home last election), Cheney only helps as the surreptitious and yet vicious mouthpiece of the White House's more scathing, negative talking points. Voters may dislike Cheney far more than they do John Edwards. But on average, Bush/Cheney hasn't reached the threshhold to mandate a change at number two. And if the campaign got to that stage, there's virtually no way to dig its way out.

       Gore : He's still obviously bitter; his 2000 jokes seem to come through gritted teeth, and his serious comments have real bite. He's warming up a bit, without coming across as obvious and phony. His rhetorical questions are good, but they could be more concise. Otherwise, he's still a bit stiff, and there's not much that helps Kerry with undecideds. Kerry's 'word is (his) bond' ... whatup, yo.   Carter : He seems tired, but he did stick to his points about international action. The theme of strength definitely emerging.   Rev. Alston : Kerry as a black Southern preacher. Drinking game participants passed out by now.   Hillary : Still a touch too formal, and more than a touch too shrill. Kerry is 'strong'; Kerry is a 'warrior'.   Bill : As FNC said, he made the case for Kerry better than Kerry ever has. His mentioning the ICC was disingenuous at best, but his rhetoric was as effective as ever. Only he could cast himself as a millionaire and use it to his advantage. This was a reminder of by how much he leaves other pols eating his dust, performance-wise. His approach to attacking Bush was best--Bush is patriotic and doing what he thinks is right, and yet he's wrong. That strikes me as the right touch, and what a lot of undecideds and  urlLink approval gap voters  think. And then he whipped the crowd up with his new slogan for the Kerry campaign: Kerry volunteered. Send him.    Can't we just send Clinton, again?

      I am of the mind that Bush should drop Cheney from the ticket.&nbsp; Not for those lame reasons that he's " urlLink unpopular " or because replacing Cheney would boost Bush (it wouldn't).&nbsp; A Bush/McCain ticket would only be up  urlLink 2 points  against Kerry/Edwards.&nbsp; I also don't believe Cheney should be replaced because of what happened in Iraq.&nbsp; As someone who opposed the war, I want to get the usual bullshit out of the way.&nbsp; Cheney did not push Bush to invade Iraq because of oil or Halliburton.&nbsp; This was not about revenge for  urlLink "daddy"  as Cleland put it.&nbsp; As much as I may dislike Bush at this point, I am not wiling to sink to those levels in believing this war was about profit.&nbsp; (I'll give my thoughts on Iraq in a later blog).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I think Cheney hurts Bush far more in one aspect that use to be Bush's strength:&nbsp; He has turned Bush from a sunny optimist into a hardcore partisan.&nbsp; Now granted, you could&nbsp;blame the Democrats for their 4 year endless assault for this. Democrats have spent four years calling Bush  urlLink a miserable failure ,  urlLink a liar , a war profiteer, an idiot, a  urlLink deserter ,  urlLink Hitler II..  the  urlLink list  goes on!&nbsp; His inauguaration was greeted with the largest demonstration against any  urlLink President&nbsp;since Nixon in 1973 .&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course if Bush gets re-elected, i suspect he'll easily pass Nixon's protest number of 60,000.&nbsp;  &nbsp; With a more optimistic VP, Bush could blunt alot of these attacks and brush them off. Bush no longer brushes them off, and I suspect he takes them to heart.&nbsp; He probably thought running the US government would be like his glory days in Texas when he met with Democrats and was a " urlLink uniter, not a divider."&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Immediately following his election, came the nicknames and reaching out to Democrats.&nbsp; I don't think Bush ever fully understood that Democrats really, deeply, and passionately hated him following the way he was elected. So he was kinda caught off guard by the sheer viciousness of the attacks against him.&nbsp; Could he have reached out to the Dems?&nbsp; Not with  urlLink Karl Rove  and Cheney giving him advice.&nbsp; Not only did they push Bush to go out there and campaign on national security against Democrats (centrist Democrats mind you), but then they&nbsp;won on it!&nbsp; This only added to the deep seated and almost irrational hatred that consumes the Democratic party today.&nbsp; All of this has changed Bush (just as it changed Clinton).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Cheney, a  urlLink hardcore conservative , has always been a "take no prisoners" type.&nbsp; He has been defiant in pushing the  urlLink Al Qaeda/Iraq connections  and harshly attacking his  urlLink Demcratic opponents .&nbsp; In time, we have seen Bush take this turn as well.&nbsp; Bush no longer seems interested in reaching out to moderates and centrists, but in making his  urlLink base as pissed off as he is .&nbsp; A Guiliani, McCain, or even Condi Rice, would hammer away at Rove, telling him that it is important to have a unified American voice and message.&nbsp; They would tell him that this gay marriage debate is portraying him to be a divider or that him brushing off people's concerns about Iraq, only irritate the middle even more.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Instead, Cheney seems to&nbsp;encourage Bush to go out there and give it to the Democrats as they gave it to him.&nbsp; That would explain his harsh, and biting  urlLink state of the union address/Meet the Presss interview .&nbsp; Both appearances were angry and defensive.&nbsp; Furthermore, Bush doesn't really talk about the future anymore.&nbsp; He has spent this entire campaign launching a  urlLink barrage of attacks  against his Democratic opponents and defending Iraq. In 2000, Bush&nbsp;was bold, visionary, and seemed like the optimist in the Kennedy/Reagan/Carter 1976&nbsp;mold.&nbsp; Now he's secretive, angry, and defensive&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Nixon/Carter 1980/Johnson 1968&nbsp;mold.&nbsp;  &nbsp; With McCain, Powell, or hell anybody on the ticket, at least Bush could actually formulate a plan for the future and be visionary.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this continues, (on both sides) my guess is Bush will be a lameduck the minute he gets re-&nbsp;elected (ditto Kerry).&nbsp; We almost need Cheney to be replaced so that at least the other half of Americans who will never ever vote for Bush, will have something or someone to be optimistic about.&nbsp; Cheney is definitely not it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This campaign has changed Bush for the worse, and Dick Cheney's persona only encourages the bitter slide of President Bush.&nbsp;

       TNR 's Lee Siegel is usually one of the more thoughtful TV critics out there, along with  NYT 's Virginia Heffernan and his opposite on the cultural axis, former  Esquire  scribe Tom Carson. But he gets a little catty in  urlLink his review of TNT's 'The Grid' . Since it's also funny, let's play Who's the Opportunistic Ass! (Modified into list format)     1. Here's an intellectual with a stalled career who writes a short muddled volume arguing an absurd historical analogy   2. [H]ere's a journalist in decline who'd long seen that the leftist star he'd hooked himself to was sinking and so seized 9/11 to finally, irrevocably swing--ranting, raving, name-calling, bullying--to the opposite ideological star   3. [H]ere's another fallen scribe notorious for abusive rhetoric and dodgy standards, who has resurrected himself and adopted the pained, rueful tone of a reluctant Catholic saint   4. [H]ere's a frenetically ambitious, transplanted British academic who is enjoying his fifteen minutes as the resident expert on imperial structures, adapting himself to the changing situation just as fast as his fleet little feet can carry him    The only one that eludes me is number one.

      And though I have vowed never to write about "meaningless" thoughts on my mind..I cannot help but say that I think love, relationships, and women are the most confusing, baffling, and depressing things ever created by God him/herself.  I've survived cancer..I've survived being poor..but I will never figure out how to survive love. Go fig.

       urlLink From the SL Tribune     A Utah moment:   Moviegoers at the Jordan Landing Cinemark movies in West Jordan received a unique greeting Monday from the ticket taker if they purchased tickets to "Fahrenheit 9/11."       To each patron, he called out: "Vote for Bush." When queried, he said he was following instructions from management.       Terrell Falk, marketing vice president for Cinemark, based in Plano, Texas, was surprised by the news and said lobbying customers for Bush was not a company policy. She was still trying to get through to the West Jordan complex as of late Tuesday to find out what they were thinking.        Meanwhile:   The Redstone 8 Cinemas at Kimball Junction placed a disclaimer under its "Fahrenheit 9/11" listings that stated: "The playing of Fahrenheit 9/11 does not necessarily represent the views of ownership or management."   One letter to the editor in The Park Record asked if the lack of disclaimers meant the ownership does agree with the views of "White Chicks" and "DodgeBall."

      C and I saw Fahrenheit 9/11, and while it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, it certainly was riddled with the sort of mendacious eliding of chronologies and unsubstantiated insinuation that I expect from Moore. What I didn't count on was that it was also often really  boring .   Don't look here for various debunkings of Moore's claims; there are other  urlLink perfectly good sites  that  urlLink do just that . But really, couldn't Moore have bothered to have acknowledged at least even a few of his opposition's points? That he'd depict prewar Iraq as some sort of idyllic paradise, then cut immediately to US missile launchings is only one of the nadirs he reaches (note that Control Room errs similarly, but only omits any mention/depiction of Saddam's brutality, rather than whitewashes the regime). Also, as Andrew has pointed out, what is Moore trying to say by juxtaposing the terror watch and 'the climate of fear' with the lack of funding for security efforts? Either we live life as though we are under constant threat of attack, or that it's all a concoction of the administration and that we should live normally. Moore can't have his cake and eat it too.  But when Moore isn't twisting facts around, he simply props up strawmen. Neither the peace activist group nor the geriatric gymrat were surveilled because of the PATRIOT Act; Bush had nothing to do with the Unocal/Taliban meeting. But through the magic of moviemaking and editing, Moore implies both.  Mostly though, C's right: the pacing was off, and any point made quickly faded with the onset of the next episode. And if she's not convinced, then I don't think anti-Bush but not pro-Kerry voters will be either.

      Our dear MLF, Peggy Noonan seems to be  urlLink growing pessmistic  about the prospects of a Bush re-election. While she is right that these have been "exciting" times, she seems to be devoid of any rationale as to why Bush hasn't been able to make it in thes "exciting times." I'll tell you what.. Truman, Lincoln, FDR, Wilson, LBJ, and Reagan all got re-elected in "exciting times" and didn't seem to rub a good portion of their nation the wrong way (at least not until the end of their respective terms).  its interesting how Noonan, Novak, and the Naitonal Review folks made such a big deal out of the fact that Bush was still winning even though over a hundred soldiers died in April/May 2004, and that many Americans were ticked about the economy.  NOw that Bush has buried the most popular Republican President in the later half of the 20th century, the economy is booming, and Iraq is marginally stablizing, all Bush could do is at best, keep  urlLink even  with Kerry.  Everyone bitched "what does it say about Kerry that he can't gain a lead over Bush even with all this trouble." Now my question is,..with all this good buzz what does it say about BUSH when he can't gain the lead against Kerry during such great times.  Heh.only time will tell. HOw's life Mike?

      ... is akin to stating that  Ahmed Chalabi is slightly discreditable. But what version 2.0 loses in its translation from its original incarnation, the echt cold war thriller, it gains in some contemporary bite, and a return to form for its long-beleaguered director, Jonathan Demme.  urlLink Slate's David Edelstein , one of the more astute movie critics working today, notes that the movie is akin to 'Fahrenheit 9/11' writ thriller, and the movie sweats liberal paranoia through its pores. And here again, just as in his last big hit 'The Silence of the Lambs', Demme's natural empathy for his characters--the freedom with which the actors emote, the constant, lingering portrait shots of the character's faces--only thrust the viewer even further into the madness of the movie. Humane directors rarely do cruel better.  But I won't write a full review here (in short: at parts illogical and a little soft, but the suspense is ratched high and the actors turn their guts out, even normally in-control star Denzel). Rather, here I'll focus on its setting, a world both almost audaciously far from ours and yet alarmingly plausible in the near future.  With terrorist attacks so common they're reported with Brokaw matter-of-factness, the movie's US is consumed with the war on terror. The armed forces are stretched thin by fire-jumping from one regional conflict to another. And multinational corporations like the eponymous entity of the movie are the real power brokers. They're so ensconced in the milindustrial complex they write themselves no-bid contracts. They raise mercenary armies to fight where the US cannot. As John Voigt's character, weary liberal senator Tom Jordan says, on their boards sit former presidents, kings and sheiks, trust-fund terrorists. It's Chomsky's world, and Manchurian Global and its ilk play in it.  Obviously, Manchurian is meant as an amalgamation of Halliburton, Carlyle, DynaCorp and other mainstays of the milindustrial complex, and as schizo and paranoid as the movie seems, its setting is possible. The movie's villain isn't simply Meryl Streep's Eleanor Prentiss Shaw--Mother Bates and Richard II in HRC's shell--but rather what breeds and fuels her kind of politician today. And here the movie burrows slightly deeper. Shaw isn't motivated simply by money. Rather, and audaciously close to my suspicions about certain figures in government today, it is a combination of power and ideology, of ill- and good-intentions, to which Manchurian happily adds its vast resources for its own money-making ends. So the NYTime's  urlLink AO Scott is only half-right  when he suggests the villainry stems from something overreaching and banal. It is both, and yet it shows an intersection of righteousness, entitlement and greed, an indignant (if sometimes incoherent) blast against the mix of ideology and profit that undeniably permeates government today.  Esquire's sometime money scribe Ken Kurson said a couple of years ago that corporations function best when they relentlessly pursue their goal, ruthlessly efficient and single-minded, and that the chips will fall eventually into a favourable pattern. Theoretically, that sounds plausible, if inhuman. But as the movie shows, that's rarely the case once the human factor is added. And there comes trouble, when the multitude of motivations both high and base factor in,  and what spews out is a myriad of ill-begotten and sometimes disastrous policies. Not that all government policy stems from this; I'm not that cynical (or libertarian), or that all the policies of even this administration arise from this noxious stew or are always uniformly bad. But the potential, the movie insists, is always there.  There's little necessarily new about this message, certainly. And this movie won't go down as a prescient classic on the order of the original. But set against an extrapolated depiction of our current struggle, it's more than a little bracing. It's both frightening and depressing.
