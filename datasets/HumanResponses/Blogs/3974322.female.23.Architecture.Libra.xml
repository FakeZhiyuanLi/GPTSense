      and of course the answer is no...  &nbsp;  it's been a long day here. got some bad news today so it's been a little extra depressing being in a quiet office with people (person, sorry)&nbsp;less than friendly. i keep telling myself that there's the concert tonight and i really should start bucking up, but when i have all of this stuff swimming around inside my head it makes it hard to focus on anything else, especially having a good time.  &nbsp;  i'm going to have to tell mike the bad news, too...  &nbsp;  lucky for me he's an understanding guy and i know he'll be cool with it, he's the best thing that's happened to me in a long time...but i know he's going to be upset, too, and that really sucks.   sigh   enough of this crap! when will i be through with this? AAARGH!!!  &nbsp;  (and i know i'm being cryptic, but forget you, anyone in the world could read this and i'm not going to divulge EVERYTHING! just know i'm pissed...)  &nbsp;  but i'll try to buck up. it's a rock concert, i love the band, i like the people i'm going with, and there's literally nothing i can do about this problem so i might as well forget about it until it's time to deal with it, right? RIGHT!  &nbsp;  luck be with you and godspeed!

      well here we are back at work...  &nbsp;  can i take back what i said yesterday when i said everyone here in this office is cool? that's because one of the bruhas was out of the office. she's back today and it only took 45 minutes into my day for me to be reminded of her, uh, sparkling personality.  &nbsp;  really, just because i'm a lowly assistant she treats me like i'm inferior, some kind of idiot child. (i'm a child compared to her old arse, right? ha ha) we all have to start somewhere, right? i mean, i've only been out of college a year... and she's what, at LEAST 10 years older than me (looks like 15, ha ha)...i hate being treated like that. however, i'd really like her to say something again and use that tone with me, because i just might call her out on it. i'll play it safe and try to get some approval from higher up. i don't think her job description says "treat ashley like crap".&nbsp;  &nbsp;  baby step to six o'clock...baby step to six o'clock....

      My first entry! Wow how exciting! &nbsp; I discovered this blog thing recently, and boom! there it is...a way to kill time here at the office because I do have a lot of downtime and here's one way to get things off my chest or rant about someone who is making me mad or talk about whatever's on my mind, which could very well be nothing at all. Who knows what it will be, that's the adventure, my friend! &nbsp; I'm at my new job, a "real" job, if you want to call it that. It isn't waiting tables, that's for sure. I'm a receptionist/administrative assistant at a design firm. Luckily everyone that works here is pretty cool, not a bunch of office stiffs, and I'm not the youngest person either. (the interns are younger) &nbsp; Today is Monday, slow day, so not much to say. I'm really excited about the upcoming weeks...Jet concert tomorrow, my man's band (his name is Mike and the band is Molasses Creek) is playing on Wednesday, and then at the end of the month I move into a new house with my new roommate (and ex-coworker) Jenn. What an exciting month! Things were so bad for a long time and it's funny in how just two months my life has made a 180. New job, new boyfriend, moving OUT OF THE PARENT'S HOUSE!!! Yes, yes, my friends, life is good. Today. And tomorrow is looking bright. (can I have some wine with that cheese, please?) &nbsp; &nbsp;

      hey, tag team back again...  i can smell food in the kitchen here at the office. it smells really good, like lasagna or something like that. tomatoey parmesaney mozzerella goodness.    ahhhhhhhhhhh     besides my hunger, one thing i want to know is why girls have the rep for being jealous, conniving witches and guys slip on by. okay, this whole experience, new boyfriend who knows old boyfriend and vice versa, has been enlightening. my ex has given me his reservations about my new relationship, saying how my choice is weird because i used to work with him (key words: USED TO), kind of a...dipping the pen in the company ink kind of thing.   my new man has told me how he doesn't like my ex, and when he mistakenly labeled him as a friend's ex and we corrected him, he laughed, "thank god you didn't make that mistake!"  should i be flattered by all of this? i guess to an extent i am. to be jealous you have to care about the person, right? now, i wouldn't say i'm jealous, but i'm WARY of mike's "friendly" relationship with his ex....i heard from one of her friends, who happens to be one of mine, that she admitted she's still in love with him. now, i think the two situations are different and i have the right to be jealous, because he maintains that he still wants to be friends with her, and i protest because you can't be friends with someone who is in love with you and i'll never be able to trust her, regardless of my confidence in our relationship, because she'll always be trying stuff behind my back. lucky for me i trust him, but not necessarily his old womenz....but i'll allow the friendship, because tony (my ex) and i have really tried the friendship thing and of course we're going to hit bumps, but if mike didn't allow our relationship i'd be very upset, so i have to do the same for him regardless of how i feel about it.  all of this, and on top of it...i'm starving.

      there's been a lot going on lately, haven't had time or thought to post anything new...  i just moved into a new house with my friend (and now my roommate) jenn, it's really cute and we even have a guestroom! the kitties just arrived yesterday, and cleo (the crazy one) kept me up for a while because she's freaked out about the new pad.  lucky for me i'm at work all day and jenn has to deal with the two cats hissing and growling at each other.  the other cat is sofie, she was my mom's cat, a stray that she took in, but the old family cat hates her and has started peeing on everything, so she has to go. it's sad, because she's so nice and puck is so MEAN!  okay, and this is what a great guy my boyfriend is: this past weekend while jenn and i were zipping all over town in the u-haul, he and his roommate went to my storage unit and EMPTIED it for me and took it to my new place...i didn't even have a hand in emptying it. i couldn't believe it. he's so good to me  awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww     no, but seriously, he's the first guy that i'm completely independent with, but i can depend on him for anything. it's a really nice change of pace. so, all you austinites reading this....  GO TO HIS SHOW THIS SATURDAY AT 8 P.M. AT MOMO'S.....he's opening for george devore...it's going to be slammin'...  okay i'm not going to plug his band anymore (Molasses Creek) so i'm just going to go now.
