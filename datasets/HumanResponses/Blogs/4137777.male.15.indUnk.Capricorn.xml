      Nothing is really new..  Kate was flipping out at me so much this morning becuase i had to break plans to go to feleichas party.. like i know why shes mad and all but she should have understood..  Like it was the first time that i have ever broke plans with her and she should have understood.. llike this was the only time in a while that i could have seen feleicha.. like she has over protective parents and they dont let her hang out with people much and she was changing schools next year..  so i havnt seen her for like 2 months and i would never see her again.. so ive been planning on going to this party so i sent kate a message and was like would u mind if i broke plans and she spazed shes like "FUCK WHAT EVER BE LIKE DOUG" and was just syaing stupid tjhings so i blocked her and left for feleichas partyy cause i had to be there before 2 and there was like no way that i could get there in time.. so i left and then when i got to the lake and was walking up to it.. i saw them all drive by me and then i was like fuck theyre not going to come back...  but they did and iw as really happy.. so i got in the car adn we were all singing american pie.. lol.. it was awsome.. then we got movies and wnet to feleichas house.. and watched a movie and i made up an excuse to leave.. i think that it was that my eye was hurting.. and it was true it hurt like a bitch.. so i left and met kate and tahna..  then i got completly drunk and went skating drunk.. it was so fucking hard to do.. lol but i got the hang of it.. there was a cute guy there that kate thought was hot and i called him mr hottie lol it was awsome.. but since it was only kate tahna kates siter and I there they let us stay later which was awsome . so then we came to my place and drunk more then left i guess..  Oh im so mad at josh feleicha told me tonight that he has done meth.. and thats harsh.. you dont fuck around with crystal meth.. its harsh..  I was so mad cuase hes like i will never take that and he did.. and it fucking sucks..  so now hes done..  Weed Hash Shrooms Ex Coke Acid Shrooms  hes so fucking stupid.. and no one cares for him anymore.. but i have to care i hate him but i still love him like a frined.. its hard i dont know whta to do ..  But im not sure i was thinking about calling the cops on him cause hes having alot of problems...  HE NEEDS HELP OR HE WILL DIE

And we were looking at this really hot guy that was across the street and someone speeds by in a car and said "Your Fat" and i wasl ike who was that and Tahna was like Anthony Tatem and Ian (the guy i used to like) and i just burst out laughing it was halarious..  See normally i would care what he said but since im over him i just laughed mty ass off. i was like how immature was that lol..

      FUCK..  My mom is really pissing me off now.. she always bitches on how we dont do anything to help out and i cleaned my room today thinking that she would be happy about it and shes like good job you kids cant do a fucking thing to help out and im like god.. im sorry thfat i cleaned my room.. shes like yah you cleaned your room but you couldnt have cleaned the kitchen and i was like no i was cleaning my room i thought that would make you happy and then i went to my room all depressed..  I want to be nice to her but she never takes the things that i do for her into consideration and it really pisses me off.. She always says that we dont do htings but im like ok i did this and this..  And my sister never gets in trouble cause shes perfect but shes the one who is pregnant at 17 its fucking stupid.. god i try to make my mother happy and nothing works.. and all she does is fucking bitches and bitches at me and i cant take it.. ted snaps at me when i say something hes starting to be like harry...  And everyone in the house is allowed to have attitude but me... my moms and ted is becuase they are tired from working and my sisters excuse is that shes pregnant and they are like u dont have an excuse so you cant have attitude.. but the thing that pisses me off is that my mom dont know when i have attitude or when im just trying to talk to her and that gets me really mad when she confuses those two emotions together..  It just makes me mad that i try and no one gives a fuck..

      So i went to the Security meeting that i was supposed to go to today..  Well heres what its about  Kate, Natahna and I talk to the hockey players on msn all the time and one found out i was gay from my profile and asked kate if i was then he flipped out on me and was threatoning me and stuff so i decided not to do security again so when i told lori our manager she convinced me to tell her what was wrong so she was pressuring me to charge him and i didnt want to but she brought it up to the board members and stuff and they said since i didnt go to the police that i dealed with it immaturaly and that they dont want to have to deal with our problems and told lori to let us go.  So she was arguing that it wasnt our fault.. but you see he was threatoning to rape kate and her sister and stuff like that so it was stupid and they were mad on how we didnt deal with it..  So we had to have the meeting and lori was telling us what was going to go on and she said that she was going to talk to deacon (the hockey player) and tell him to back off but she wanted to let us know she was going to do this becuase she thinks that he will come after us so were not going to talk to him anymore..  But she said that we were mature and that she woudl rather us be helping out with security then doing drugs on the street and stuff so she said shes going to fight with them and make sure that they let us do Security again..  Then after that i drove Kate and Tahna to my house and when we were pulling in i saw my mom so i was like halfway into the turn when they pulled in before me so i turned the other direction and floored it home.. ted saw the girls get out of the car but he didnt care.. you see i dont have my license.. so my mom never knew  so kate and tahna came in and we played my drum and played basket ball cause the hot fire guy was out there.. but then we wnet on my trampoline and then ted took us to kates house.. and we went in her pool and sauna then back to her house and watched a movie..  And she was being very immature and burned a picture of a hockey player she was mad at .. and im sorry but thats stupid to do.. very immature.. even tahna says that we all have matured but her...  But then we watched movie and then we left. But i wanted to go for coffee first so we did but kate was a bit grumpy .. but they remembered lori said that one of the players on the hockey team were gay and they dont care.. but they started to think about who was gay and was listing them off. but i dont get how it really matters and why they should  be talking about it...  so i was walking faster then them and tahna was like are you embarassed to walk with us and i was like no i just dont like that conversation and kate gets attitude and said OKAY THEN and tahna was like well talk about it on the bus and this really pisses me off cuase they dont need to be talking about it what does it have to do with them right...  so i dunno on the bus they were talking about being high and stuff like that and thjose are not things that i want to talk about when there are alot of poeple around so i was like excluding my self from the convo.. but then they got off the bus and i waved by and all was well..  But i just think that im like this becuase of those anti depressants  that they put me on to help me sleep more.. so im not sure how i feel becuase i started to take thyem yesturday..

      Life has been really akward recently theres been so many things that ahve been happening.. good and bad i guess  Kate and Natahna came home from camping a couple days ago and we went to the lake which was really fun.. well i needed to go and by a new bathing suit so tahna came with me in the morning so i can go to the mall and buy a bathing suit.. and i had about 48 dollars to buy one so i didnt know where i would get one so i went to my fav. store atheletes world and i was lookiong at the shoes there and i saw the hottest pair in the world like omg it was so hot and loved them..  But we got the bathing suit.. i didnt have enough to pay for 2 of the taxes so the lady only made me pay for one of them which was good.. then we called Kate when we were in the food court getting a drink and we called kate cause she was going to cmoe to the lake with us so then she said she was going to get ready and come and see us so she did and ted came and gave us more money to get something to eat so i bought them both a piece of pizza and then we went to the bus stop where we saw josh and Amy which was cool.. except for josh  No one understands that im hurt from all the drugs that hes doing and so is Natahna, everything that he says is like a lie now.. he was telling us how he stole a pair of pants from value village which costed a dollar twenty five like what the hell thats harsh.. and then he was saying that he has to go to youth shelters so he can get food and im like what are you using your work money for and he was like to pay off my credit cards i owe them 2000 dollars and hes only 16 and imlike ur fucking stupid..  So the whole day at the beach i kept on saying that drugs are dumb and stuff and kates like why would u say something like that.. and i was like cause hes stupid for doing drugs like that and kates like yeah i dont care.. and that was stupid for her to say becuase we should care for josh hes going to really hurt his self and we all know it...  But thats enough about that .. the lake was fun we saw so many really hot guys like we were completly horned out of our minds cause they were so fine.. they were all hella tanned and had the hottest boddies ever and they were right but god they were hot..lol  But then the next day i had to go to the doctors office and they said that they were going to book me a surgons appointment for Gastric Bypass Surgury and then when were talking abouty me having insomnia and he prescribed me mild anti depresants to help me sleep which i dnt understands but i didnt want to take them but i took them last night and its weird..  But i have to get going to a security meeting now so pce

      I have just noticed that i seem to write about the present and then the past .. i just noticed that and i think its weird..  so its about 6:30 in the morning and my eyes are burning cause i never got any sleep again.. I tried sleep but like normal there was no luck...  I was talking to nicole about 3 in the morning i was so happy cuase nicoles the best im really glad that im friends with her..   We were talking about the O.C. and how we hate theresa and how we hate how sad the ending was.. well i went on the internet and i found so many sites that tell you about what happens next year and im so happy. It kind of sucks that the show isnt back on till november.. thats such a long time to wait...  Well the other day i was writing about how tahna kate and i got into a fight.. well during this i didnt know who to talk to so i was writing tahna letters but i never gave them to her.. it was my way of expressing my emotions so im going to write them on here...    Letter 1          Wow, Were fighting Natahna thats not us. Im sorry but since you are the one who knows why we are fighting take a minute to think why.          Letter 2          If im correct there should be a teddy bear included with these letters.          THIS IS NOT A BRIBE BEAR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT!!!          This bear is a symbol of our friendship. If we are done being friends then the bear means goodbye nice being friend.          But if you say you do want to be friends then consider it a refrienship bear.          I know that these letters are really frysterating but trust me im tired of writing them I just think that if we keep talking then it might work and we could all get along.          I honestly dont want to fight. If we are not going to be friends then i hope that we can just be civil aobut it and not make poeple have to choose about who they want to hang out with . I dont want to us to fight but if you decide for us not to fight I would be happy.          If you dont want to be friends we should be mature about it and not be mean to each other and jsut not hang out          Letter 3          Okay in the next few lettersi m going to cover some problems that im sure you guys have been feeling          IM ANNOYING AND I KNOW IT          I say things without thinking and I have been improving. I used to go MITCH JAZ THINKS YOUR HOT and you guys told me later on that you didnt like that so i stopped.          I dont know im doing something wrong until i am told. I know im annoying whenever i say something i feel like its stupid. Hanging out with me alot os annoying i know it im sorry but i am working on that. I just dont know what I am saying when I say them, and im sorry.          I just need for someone to tell me nicely, and in private if what I said was wrong and I will try to stop it. I dont want to fight i want to make it work.           Letter 4             About the talking behind our backs part I will not lie and say i didnt do it.          I did. I talked about Kate and Natahna behind their backs and im sorry it was a really dumb thing to do. I know that its a big shock to learn that someone is talking about you. Im sorry. but i dont get how you guys can be mad about this when Natahna you told me that Kate was talking about me ( i have notes to prove it) and Kate said tahna was talking about me (have convos to prove it)          I dont care about this I am willing to let this go if you guys are. Talking aobut someone is so easy to do and I am going to work on controlling this cuase I know what Its like for poeple to do it.          So can we put this behind us since we are all guilty?           Letter 5           Me Being overprotective is something that bugs you guys and you have expressed that to me and im glad.          the night of the party with the players, i was completly out of line. I had no right to tell you guys what you can or cannot do your big girls. I know i could write several lies to you guys making up excusses on why I thought you shouldnt but im not going to. I changed my mind about the party when i got to the Westbay cause I then knew about how badly you guys wanted to go. I did partially stick up for you guys when Nicky was bitching. I said you were a kid once let them make thier own mistakes.. There I get it now im wrong i shouldnt be mothering you on my mistakes but let you make your own mistakes.          I get by what you mean dont care.. If i think you are doing something wrong to let you do it and lead about it yourself. I get what you mean and now i understand I am overprotecive of you guys sorry ur right.           Letter 6             Im sorry that I bug you.          But im just relaly confused abuot why we cant work this out. I think that we should all just talk about it or pass nice notes to each other and think of a solution.          Wel all do things that annoy, disturb, piss each other off but there is solutions to them.          Like Kate when you and I were always fighting and yealling at each other we come up with the system of passing notes and I think that cut our fights in half. And Natahna when we have a problem with each other we think it through and have a civilized discussion and we think of a solution so we dont get into big fight.          We managed to figure out ways so we call can get along and why cant we just do that this time so no one will get hurt at all cause thats not what I want.          I hope we can all just do something to figure out our problems :)           Letter 7           Hey again I decided that I was going to write you letters till the end of us hating each other which I think will be for a few years.          I heard from a friend of ours that you had a dream about me...          What was it:          You had a dream that you were killing me and you were liking it and you were sleep talking and yealling my name out loud and your mom walked in and thought i was there.          Also I heard form this same person that you hated me all along and was just pretending to be nice to me..          It was weird hearing this since i have been hearing and denying it all school year. You told me Kate was using me and I heard from Josh that your dad told amy the same thing...          Its weird how things get back to me eh!           Letter 8             I know were hatin but why cant we be civil about it.          The day i was going to the bak with josh you guys went up to him and said you were saving him from me and he said he was okay and you guys tried to beg him to leave me.. that was mean.          Even though were fighting I think that we shouldnt make the people were all friends with have to choose cause thats not fair to anyone.          Also at the end of lunch I was sitting with maranda blue and you gave josh a kiss you said to him.          "Dont give him one" then you looked at me.          That was just stupid for you to say. Im not trying to take doug or josh away from you guys i just want to hang out with them also.           Letter 9             I found out today from kate that you never actually went to your camping trip with your family.          I heard that you just get your family to say that cause you didnt want to talk to me.           If you didnt want to talk to me then you should have just told me instead of lying to me.          I dont know why you told me about the camping thing. If it wa sbecuase of the G>S>A thing than you should have just told me. YEah i would have been mad at you for a small bit but then like everything else i would have gotten over it.          When josh told kate to get new friends I had nothing to do with that.           Letter 10             Ive always heard people say that a day doesnt go by without them thinking of you... and its so true..          OVERPROTECED     Britney Spears          Say hello to the girl that I am Your gonna have to see through my perspective     I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am     And I dont wanna be so damn protective     There must be another way cause I believe in taking Chances     But who am i to say     what a girl is to do     God i need some answers          What im  I to do with my life     you will find it out dont worry     How am i supposed to know whats right     you just got to do it your way     I cant help the way i feell     but my life has been so ooo-verprotected          etc..           Letter 1             I guess the first day after I got the news you guys didnt want to be friends with me we all were confused.          EDverything happened so fast. the next day when we met at the bus stop I saw you and instantly cried you came up to me and gave me a hug and said sorry, this made my cry more.          I was so confused about what was going on and was so hurt that I cried all the way to school. You were being so nice to me and I thought that it was all over with.          but when you were in Capp class with Kate that day you were being mean to me again. I couldnt stay in class so i packed my things up and left. Sometimes I feel like you dont know why you hate me and just follow kate.          Like for example in gr. 9 you were mad without knowing why..          That was following Kate           Letter 12           Its Weird          Every day when i see you wer get further apart.          Like the first day you were so nice, the second only mean around KAte 3rd always mean 4th on just ignoring me all the time.          Its weird cause i dont know if i should ay hi or anything cuase i dont know what to do.          Its so weird ever since we stopped being friends josh and i have been better friends. I dunno i hear from everyone that you talk about me but i guess I try to ignore it.          One other thing that confuses me is that the night when kate told you that i told her you talk about her she was being really nice to me so we went to the beach where she for the first time talked behind your back ...          I never told kate what you said about her so i wont tell you what she said.           Letter 13             The only reason why I finished all of your typing pal was becuase i felt bad about it.          you see when i used to care about you guys i used to say you should get off e-messenger and do your work then go on it.          I wasnt like trying to bribe you by doing your typing pal.          The reason before why i said yo shouldnt drink of get high was because at the hockey games you said you hated in in grade 8 and didnt want you to do it agian so i just didnt want you to do it for that reason.          and can you please stop going up to josh and saying things like          "so now your friends with chris?"          I know about when you say that and I dont think we should makeJosh take sides.           Letter 14             WOW tahna,          Im so confused kates not here because shes sick so you are being nice to me.. isnt that weird...          Omg is that weird...          Haaa Silletta looks like a fish lol.          You know its not nice to be nice to me when KAtes not here but be mean to me when she is.          Also on the bus I said I didnt like girls and you muttered are you sure about that.          I know u and kate dont believe that i am gay but dont tell me that.          I heard by alot of people that you think im straight. I didnt say anything on the bus becuase i dont want to fight with you I would just rather you hurt my feelings           Letter  15           Its really weird, theres like absolutly nothing wrong with you..          the reason why i never talked to KAte about you was becuase i dont have any problems with you to rant about to her.          I feel like you are just being pressured by kate to do all these things cuase you dont seem mean to be at any other time and it sucks...          Like in grade 9 when kate was on the bus you would be so mean to me but when she got off the bus we had good times and got along togethre.          Ive been wondering if deciding to be your guys friends again was a wrong thing to do theres just too much hate, I dont know I guess that we all just do things that annoy each other          I guess im just writing this because i cant say it to your face        So thats how the letters went...

      When I was a youngster when i was bout in grade 5 i never really fitted in with the kids in my grade so i would hang out with the kids in grade 7 and they thought i was really cool.. its was like my crew.  So when i moved to b.c. i lost contact with them all.. and then today i found a letter that one of them wrote me ... heres how it goes    Dear Petunya (Christian)                         March 19/97                     I havnt recieved any letters from you, but I heard a commercial today about skiing in British Columbia and I thought of you. So how do you like it there? Alcona's the same. School is almost over, which makes me happy, because were graduating . but I'll miss GoodFellow and all my friends becuase im going to a different highschool. We got our pictures developed, and I have my picture of you, me and Amber on my corkboard! how was your March Break? I just hung-out with my friends, went to the movies etc. So do you like any older girls up there? Hows the weather, we had a big snowfall recently, but its starting to melt, I cant wait until the summer. Hows school going, you probably made tons of new friends and have forgotten about us up here. Well i have to go now but write me a letter and tell me whats up.               - Bye-Bye         From Jenn rowbottem     Im not sure if i sent her a letter back or not when i was younger.. but its sad cause i really miss her now.. she was 2 years older then me and i miss her.. When i left one of the teachers name Ms. Slater had an affair with one of her students and was caught by her husband also a teacher at the same school Mr. Slater.. they put her in jail etc....

        Im being to stressed out....      I officially get no sleep these days and its really starting to affect the way i do things these days.. im always tired and i never want to do anything.. I get about 2 hours of sleep a night and thats really not good.. i get about 2 hours sleep like 3 days a week and the rest i just dont sleep at all..   Its no that i try to stay up and throw all nighters its just that when i get tired i get to bed and when i lay down im suddenly awake and hyper again which sucks cause i want to sleep so when i go back to doing something im tired agian.. its like my mind is fuckign with me..  And since i dont sleep i ahve other problems like headaches and dizzyness and being grumpy which sucks.. I dont know what it is but in the last month i lost 34 pounds and that was really weird cause i havnt put that much of an effort into it.. like all of a sudden my appatite changed and i just dont get hungry and i have to eat less or i will get sick.. it reminds me of being in the hospitall.. i will eat any kind of food becuaes i have had the hospital food for 2 weeks and that is like suicide.. i went crazy in there and stopped eating.. They serve you eggs with everything..  My plans for today got cancelled which really pissed me off.. tahts like my number   one pet peive is when peopple make plans and then cancell them at the last moment and dotn really give you enough time to like be okay with it..   Like kate forrest does that all the time she will make plans with you then at the end of the converstaion shes like oh yeha umm im not allowed to go out becuase i have to clean my room and i was like you said a few mintues ago that u didnt have to clean it and now u do and then she goes on and gives me like 100 other stories which really pisses me off... so now i just dont plan with her.. everytime i hang out with her tahna comes so i plan through tahna and she talks to kate about it.. that was my solution around it...  I really like tahna she is my best friend for alot of reason.. she always is there to talk to like no matter what she has good things to talk about and when i have a problem she always has something to relate to.. everyone knows what its like talking to someone who has never experianced what your talkinga bout and they dont know what to say or to do.. but tahna has always experianced the same things as me which i love.. and shes always there to talk to like i said.. shes always helpfull and courteous to talk to...  She tells me alot of things that she dont tell anyone and i keep them a secret but the only thing that sucks about tahna and kate is that they wont really hang out with me like 1 on 1.. well kate has a few times but they dont do it often.. like when ever we go places it has to be with the other.. like we all are a gang.. I remember when our friend was having problems with drugfs which he still is.. we went to the councellor and she yelled at us becuase she said that we were ganing up on him becuase we are talking to him in 3's and cause all 3 of us care and the same time and this pissed me off becuase we all were hurt by josh so much that we needed to stick together to make things better..  But the bad thing about being in a group of 3 is that when ever smoeone in the group fights there is always that one perosn in the middle and you always seem to take both sides.. like kate when she gets mad at me she gets tahna mad at me but tahna can never stay mad at me she will write me a letter and tell me whatas going on or will just help me solve the problem... Except for this one time about 2 months till the end of school kate was talking to me on the compouter and said tahna and i dont want  to be your friend anymore.. and she blocked me.  I was in shock like wow where did this come from cause i thought that everyhitng was okay so i called Natahna and was like whats this about you guys not wanting to be my friend and she wasl ik ei dunno.. im going through some things and i was like then why are you taking it out on me and shes like its not just you its everyone and i was just mad and im like so what im the only one u stop being friends with if your mad at everyone..  and the thing that sucked about the whole thing is that i never really got a good excuse from either of them.. and i was hurt so much like i cant really remember why i was so hurt.. but i cried on the phone with her so much and i hung up and said i cant talk like this.. and i cried myself to sleep that night.. i was feeling so confused and lonley.. like i wasnt to upset about loosing kate casue shes not always the nicest to me but tahna i missed so much.  They were mad at me for one night and iw as so hurt just form that.. so the next day i was walking to the bus stop and natahna takes that with me and she walked up a side street and met me and i was crying already like i was crying the whole morning also.. and she gave me a hug and she said im sorry.. i never ment to hurt you... and we just stood there and hugged for like 2 minutes and icouldnt help but cry and cry.. i was so mad at her for puting me through tahtg but i had a feeling that everything was going ot be ok..  and that hug was the worse moment of my life.. i lvoed the hug i was all happy at the time but i just kept on remmebering her crying also and saying that shes sorry and hugging me and it hurt me to get that hug..   So we stopped hugging and got onto the bus together and we sat on top of the double decker bus and no one knew what was going on cause we wernt too good of friends with them at the time.. and i was sitting there and tahna has mascara running and im all quiet which is unnormal for me.. and the whole way to school i jsut kept on remembering that hug and remember how sad i was and i cried all the way to school and tahna would be fine till she looked over at me and then she would cry...  So when we got to school she was being all nice to me in the school and everything.. THen kate shows up and starts to say alot of mean shit to me and what do u know tahna starts to say them to and takes kates side and i was like omg what happening .. why was she being nice to me before.. and  i just got my bag and went and cried in the stairway. I felt betrayed and so hurt.. And then i was like ok.. be strong i have several other friends.. so i went looking for them and none were there yet so i just walked around and i was avoiding the foyer where they sit and one time i walked through there and kate was like look at the looser..  And that hurt so much like everything was still such a shock to me like yesturday we were best friend and then today u guys despise me like whats up with that.. So the bell rang and we were all in our first class together.. so i showed up a bit late i went to wash my face.. and i sat down where i always do beside natahna and i sat  down and kate was like what do u think your doing sitting htere and i was like i always sit there so they went and moved.. and tahna threw me a piece of paper and we started to write each other letters.  Heres how it goes:  Chris: You guys really hurt me last night  Tahna: Im sorry ohk...  Chris: But why would you do that.. i cried for a hour and the whole bus ride to school it hurts me to look at you  Tahna: I said sorry.. im just confused about everything.. ur not the only one im flipping at.. and i cried last night 2... ur not the only one that feels depressed right now.. i never asked for any of this!  Chris: Then why did you and Kate bring it up.. huh.. that seems like you did want it. and you said you asked about guys i like and i broke down..  I cant talk about people that hurt me that hurts.. I have asuch a fucked up life and i havnt told you any of it. I have problems and ms dempster said caring is good. It seems like the nicer I am the meaner you guys get last year i had a crush on you and look what happened and this year the same thing is happening.  Thana: I dunno.. I hate it when people care for me and i hate it when i care for people but i still do.. i have been hurt so many times and my life is probalby more fucked up then urs.. sure i talk about it but i dont talk about half of it... and im sory! i asked about who u liked cuase i figured that u listen to my shit all the time and i never considered that maybe u needed someone to talk 2 as well! I know i dont know anything about John but I would if you just tell me.. I mean when u flipped @ me last nite saying i knew nada about wut john did 2 u it kinda hurt me 2! Cuz i became defenceless! u cant just bring that up if i know nothing about it.. and u keep bringing it up whenever something goes bad.. and it makes me feel bad  Chris: Cause i was talking about mike and i brought him up and u asked me what he did cause i said someting  But still screw john i wasnt flipping out last night i was 100% hurt by what kate was saying and when you said it was true it hurt. I just cant believe you guys are mad because im being a friend and caring thats just bullshit. Friends care I dont know how you were raised.  If you dont want to be my friend tell me now.  Tahna: K I neva said i didnt wanna.. i just need my space! like being protective.. yeah i undertand u care but let us make our own mistakes! and just cuz we wann hang out with doug and josh dont say u feel like ur loosing us.. cause ur not.. we just need 2 be other people or have our own sace just cause were friends doesnt mean we have 2 spend all our free time together.. were gonna choose to hang out with our other friends at times.. i know uve been giving us space but we still feel crowded.     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So that was that convo and since then me and natahna have continued to work it out and she became nice to me.. but then the night that we me and tahna were writing letters kate came on msn and said that she forgave me and stuff and that she missed me and hated to fight so she asked me to go to the lake with her and i did and we had fun and never fought or anything.. so the next day in school i sat down and was like hey and shes like why are you talking to me and i was like cuase were friends agian and kate was like no were not i was like but the lake shes like what abuot it i just wanted to go swimming.. accept it i used you..  and i flipped out and just grabbed my binders and left class and got someone to tell the teacher that iw ill talk to her tommorow.. i was so mad like omg.. that hurt me cuase i thought we were friends again.. then.. my depression started again.. i hung out with my other firneds but i didnt like it as much..  so about a week passed and we were all still not friends.. but i made it so we didnt talk to each other at all.. and we just ignored each other.. in class kate would make remarks that only tahna would laugh at and cam or megan or someone popular would be like wow bitchy whore much.. or say something in my defence..  But i never cared about kate still it was just tahna... and now she wouldnt talk to me anymore.. so i was like ok i dont need to talk to you.. im ok.. and i just ignored them and then about half a week later i wwas happy agian.. i was happy not to be their friends.. i felt so free from bull shit.. and i was just glad to be free... i was so happy and i think taht this pissed them off..  so i just gave it more time and they came around and said that they missed me and apologized and ever since then life was better.. we havnt fought as much cause me and kate decided that when we have a problem that we should talk it out instead of flipping out..   Then thigns got better since then and we are all still friends right now which is really good.. but god when we were in grade 9 i had a crush on natahna and i told kate and she told natahna so i got mad at her and called her a bitch and kate turned natahna against me and they would make fun of me cuase i was a loner back then and then they would get random people that they didnt even know to make fun of me and that hurt so much..   But i knew that Natahhna never really hated me cause when i got off the bus she would change sides to see me and that made me feel good.. then during yearbook signing they were like hey chris can i sign ur yearbook and i was like no go away and they apologized and i was like ok.. and they were nice then on the bus that day kate was like hey look at the fat ass.. and shes like oopss sorry had to get it out.. so over the summer they both added me on msn and we started again.. and we just hhung out since then..  We have so many good memories.. and im happy about them all....  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  but back to more recent thigns in my life.. my mom and my sister have been so close that its making me jelous and they keep on going crystals fat now and im like twice as big as her and im like thanks so what am i and they are just like oh nothing lol and it hurts my feeligns and how my mom never has time for me still.. well thats the way its been my whole life.. but im going to go now... its been a hour writing in here so cya
