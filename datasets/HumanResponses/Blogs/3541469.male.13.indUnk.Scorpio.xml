      Ok...this entry is about the solo walk i had in the camp. Basically there r six stations and at each station the station master will give you the password for you to tell it to the next station master. The first one is where all of us gather and have an exciting briefing >:D. This briefing is held by our senior who has graduated in the school. Each one got to take turns to begin the walk and there will be a 3-minute interval. At the first station, there were a lot of scaredy cats, mainly my juniors, who were whimpering and well...pissing me off. The senior began to tell them to stop being scared and start doing the solo walk because he will keep on telling stories about the school (real or not i dunno but i hope its real >:D) after one guy goes. 1 impression he gave me...our school is real haunted man. Let me share with you some...  1)During the Japanese occupation, our school was the headquarters of the Japanese army and there were many prisoners in the opposite of the building. In between the 2 buildings, there was a canal. The headquarters overlooked the canal. So if there were any escapers, soldiers would bring them to a room located in the headquarters and torture them. The room was called the Torture room. Now the room is a classroom located in the clock tower of our school. It was said that the room will unlock itself...because my senior said that once when he was camping in this school when it was nearing the exam period during his last year. Everyone would be studying and he had asked his friend where did he study. He said he studied in the classroom...shouldn't all the classrooms be locked at the night by then?  2)My school is a very famous school and it was founded by someone who is a good and famous man, by the name of Tan Kah Kee. We had a statue of him and it was said that during midnight, he would come down and patrol the whole school. And if you had a chance of bumping into him, he would ask you what the time is. If u tell him, he would give u a slap and walk away...  3)In the year 1999, there was a boy who played in the school band. Once he went to the school hall to practise. In our school hall, there were many big square holes which linked to different parts of the school downstairs. And that boy had fell down to one of the holes, straight down to the squash court. The next day, someone discovered him...dead.  So, how's my storytelling skills? Hope you can comment on them ^^  Well, When i had my turn of doing the walk, i erased all of spooky thoughts in my mind and changed them to CS thoughts! ^^ I was thinking about CS during the whole walk.  P.S. The creator of this blog will not be responsible if the ghost stories told are fictional.
