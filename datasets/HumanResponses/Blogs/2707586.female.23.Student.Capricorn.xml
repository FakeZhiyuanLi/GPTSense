       jody, thanks for your support as i work through my loss.    also, what is this you were talking about people who went sledding on a couch.  i've heard of people using weird things, but a couch?  please explain.

       It has come to my attention that the people around me are weenies. Not the good ones from Jake's that taste incredibly delightful at 1am after a long night of fun, but the kind that are afraid of going outside when its below freezing. Now I realize that not everyone grew up in the artic tundra that I did, but you would think that the weather patterns have not changed dramatically in the last 20 years so those people who did grow up with snow would not be so shocked to see the temperature below zero. I am in utter shock at the amount of people who say "its too cold to go outside." I am also shocked at the amount of people from very warm places willing to go out in this cold just to have a good time. I do believe that most of the people sledding with us last night had had few encounters with snow in their lives which made it much more fun. The most fun was had by Ricky who is from the Philippines. He was a wild man on a sled and he almost made it into the street a few times. Tuyvon from Australia also really enjoyed her first time frolicking in the snow. All in all it was a good time although I was disappointed I never did see the people sledding on the couch. Maybe next time!  In a side note: Tiff I am so sorry for your loss. Its always hard to loose such a good friend and I hope that after a time of mourning, you will be able to move on. It is always difficult but I have faith that you will endure.   urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

       today i had to witness a death in the family.  about 1107 am i glanced down at my watch and noticed that the time it read was 456 am.  yes, my watch died on my today.  i've been going through mourning all day.  i've had this watch, going on 6 years now.  we've been through everything together from dinners, parties, movies, vacations, showers, and even sleepovers.  i've yet to take it off b/c i feel naked without it.  however, if i continue to wear it, it will look like it's just there for looks.  but it's not.  i actually used my beloved watch to always know what time it was.  but what to do.  also, i now have to decide what to do about the whole situation....should i get a new battery or just let her go and get a new watch.  time will only tell.  as for now, i have to read military time on my stereo.

       okay, ive gone to A source about the future of hokie house.  my source was a former employee of hh and he said that half of the staff was laid off.  only 90 people are allowed in, whereas it used to be that number plus 200 for the upstairs part.  the owners are currently renovating the upstairs, but it still remains a mystery as to whether or not they will change it to meet fire code regulations.   all these questions and more will hopefully be answered within the next few months.

       So far I have been kinda sliding through grad school. I was getting paid to do nothing which is the best way to be but all good things must to come to an end. Today I not only am starting to work on articles for my professor but I have to start a thesis for one of my classes! Stupid economists want to get the most for their money (maximize utility through output subject to a budget constraint) I do wish someone would clarify on Hokie House. I was devistated when I read Tiff's message!   So I think I am going to win Brendan's Super Bowl Pool... I just have to because I didn't get crap last year (except the enjoyment of watching it with all of you) But I need more! I will be watching the big game with the dog and cat and turtle that I am pet sitting for the week. It should be a blast!  Oh I was going to tell you about the ballet. It was Cinderella performed by The Moscow Festival Ballet. They were pretty good but I kept thinking "I bet Michelle could do this." It was an interesting take on the story and the step-mother was played by a man which gave it a little twist. I now feel I have had enough culture to last awhile so I won't be going back soon.  urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

       last night was adventurous.  it was karaoke night at macadoes in radford.  the atmosphere was full drinking, smoking, and of course singing.  i think i heard every country song that was ever recorded last night.  i knew the night was hopping when a few cowboys got up to sing, "she thinks my tractors sexy."  all the while the crowd was going wild and stomping to the beat.  unfortunately michelle and i did not get to go up and sing on stage b/c there were like 50 people before us.  however, that did not stop us from singing out of tune at the table.  in fact, allision even got in on the act and she and i sang "strawberry wine," among others.  all in all, it was a good night.

       snow.  that wonderful white stuff that falls from the sky to make it beautiful down here in sunny blacksburg.    we had a high today of 21 degrees...."we're having a heat wave, a tropical heat wave."  with the snow came a miracle....vt closed its doors.  i was excited to get up this am at 6am to find out that school was canceled, then i went back to bed.  regardless of the fact that i had to work, it's been a great day.  now, the time has come to play....who's w/ me.

       So our Grad School Org encouraged all of us to attend happy hour at Brothers friday after classes. This seemed like a great time and believe me it was. By 8 we were all feeling "so good" and decided that we should probably eat something. So a group of us headed to BW3's and had a good old time. I ended up staying at my office mate, Whitney's house. We got up Saturday morning and had to return the car we had borrowed the night before and then had a delectible lunch served by a hottie named Bo who made our day because something about that dark brown hair and blue eyes didn't bother us at all. So after watching a couple chick flicks I ended up crashing with Whitney again last night and I am sure that my roommate has officially reported me missing or something but I don't care. I am now attempting to do homework which I am not getting done and then I am headed to the ballet with some new friends. I'll let you know how that goes. Now I must work on my math and read a book that is a scientific paper disguised as a novel.  urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

       in recent news, i've heard that hokie house has had to shut down the upstairs portion.  they say its b/c there were not enough fire exits.  word on the street is that only overs can even enter its doors.  but what does this now mean for other places like sharkeys??  does this also mean that this is the end of comedy club?  let me know if you have any info on the current situation.  in other news, the lady hokies pulled out a win over boston college of 80 to 64.  a very exciting game to all that attended.

       tonight was all about the 3 b's: bands, beer, and bonfires.  well, actually only 2 of them...but two of three isn't bad.  anyway, liberation was on fire.  i really enjoyed the show they put on.  nice sound, creative lyrics, and just fun to watch.  if you like good music, i highly recommend them.  just trust me on this one.

       Today has been far too long of a day. I find my relaxation in laughter...  "It is clear our nation is reliant upon big foreign oil. More and more of our imports come from over seas." ~a wise statement from our fearless leader~  or maybe this is better...  "For every fatal shooting, there were roughly three non-fatal shootings. And, folks, this is unacceptable in America. It's just unacceptable. And we're going to do someting about it." ~guess who once again~  Have a super great night everyone!

       Who the heck ever thought of having classes start at 7:30 AM? They must have been nuts! Its been an aweful long day but I came home to my roommate offering me some Filipino food which was awesome. Who would have known that having a 40 year old mother of two living in my room would come in so tasty. Oh by the way, can I have Montana back when you guys are done with it. I think I could do better things than fill it with radiation and then Sean wouldn't have to jack any nukes for you. Just a thought!  urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');

       i agree with my comrade, we are not here to make war with the guys of apt245.  all we wanted to do was just tell the world our story.  let them see and understand the world through the eyes of a female.  maybe then, the male population can truely start to understand us better.  however, in our endeavors in doing so, we copied the guys idea.  who cares.  but in the words of jody....let us make love and not war.     peace.

       Wow! Who new the uproar we would cause at apt245. I didn't know that we were even in competition. I thought they would be upset that we were copying their idea but Apparently they want a war, and there just not going to get one because here in 409, we make love, not war . As for the nine out of ten earholes that choose apt245, you wouldn't have even had a season without your loyal fans and cheerleaders who stood in the snow and cold to be there for you, so as much as we love you, I just have to say, behind every good earhole there is a tiffjody.

       Todays lunch was soooo good.  Michelle and I went to red lobster to take advantage of their all you can eat shrimp deal.  Let just applaud michelle for her eating abilities.  I thought I could eat a lot (remember last years event at outback then o’charleys…) but I was wrong.  Mmmm….it was good.  That’s all I can say.

       What a bad blogger I have been! I do promise I haven't fallen off of the planet just yet... To make up for some lost time...  ~Tiff's wine gathering was excellent (taboo and all). It turns out that James and I can pass of for bro and sis... ~I have been teaching a majorly huge amount and spending way too much time trying to plan a recital and way not enough time on what's really important (like blogging...) ~And what ever happened to the HUGE snow storm that never materialized??! ~I have learned that scrabble can be addicting. Please play with caution and moderation. ~Jody- keep up the good work with your alcohol break... and I would say nothing wrong with counting down. I count down lots of things! ~Tiffany- I hope that you will not give up on your dream for a new watch... AND you now have me worried for my car inspection... I am just a day away from my inspection month. YIKES! ~BE SURE TO WATCH THE 8PM OSCARS TONIGHT!!! ~and last but not least: the pro and con to my great sat. night out:  pro- I had a great time seeing familiar faces. I attended a wannabe class reunion. Tiff you soooo shoulda come! Good times. con- I have temporarily lost the ability to walk as normal people do. This is very sad news... not being able to walk is unacceptable for most people but this presents a much more extensive challenge for the dancer in me. not so fun :(  Hobbling until next time....

       So this no alcohol thing is being put to the test pretty hard. Tonight is Sangria Spectacular and tomorrow is fourth Friday where our department encourages us to attend happy hour together. So I am really feeling the effects of lent but I do feel good about myself for not partaking in the consumption of alcohol. The biggest problem now is that I am counting down the days and I feel that this may be taking away from the cause. On the other hand the last time I drank I didn't feel good so the thought isn't that appealing to me.   I have been completely nonproductive today. I had a beautiful test at 7:30 this morning that I know I missed a 12 point question on and I don't know how to feel about the rest. So its been an incredibly long day but I think hang out time with everyone is going to be good for me tonight. Zach is bringing his friend who was picking on me in while I was in an alcoholic state but this time I will be sober and I wont be showing cleavage to make him miss his pool shots. I hope I make a better impression this time! Oh the things I wish I hadn't done while intoxicated!

       Today I had to go to the dentist.  I hate going.  In fact, I purposely didn’t go this summer when I was due b/c I hate it so much.  I’ve never had any problems like cavities or anything.  I just don’t like the dentist office.  You can call me an anti-dentite.  But today’s check-up was like all the others.  I went and laid in the chair.  The hygienists talks to me, while cleaning my teeth.  I answer her w/ a few gargles.  The dentist comes in, checks my teeth, and tells me they look great.  I get my toothbrush and leave.    On another note.  I just got my car back w/ new tires.  My dad is the best dad in the whole world.  He went and got the tires put on for me b/c I didn’t have time to do it myself due to classes all day yesterday.  Plus, I told him to just get me 2 b/c that’s all I needed.  However, when I got my car back today, it had 4 new tires on it.  Meaning, my dad helped me out and paid for the other 2 tires.  Plus, it helped that we were able to get a rebate that was the price of about one tire.   Anyway, today’s been a good day…..no cavities and new tires.  Now I get to go take a nap in class, then off to cook at the DBH.

       So a bunch of us girls went out last night for dinner and then meet up with the guys at a bar to celebrate Mardi Gras. Well there was a costume contest and wow what costumes. There were a few pirates but my favorite guy all night was Captain Crunch who's shirt said "show me your crunch berries" and had a pho penis complete with pubes sticking out of his pants. I also enjoyed the life size penis that was walking around and the life size sperm that should have been with them cus that would have been funny but they weren't together. There were also lots of girls dressed up but nothing real cool except my friend Zach said there was one that when she bent over her breasts fell out. We ended up going home early because of lack of standing space and I didn't feel well. It was just too crowed to have a good time.   Now I am avoiding studying for my finance test at 7:30 tomorrow morning. I really should study for this one but you know me.. I am the worst studier ever!

       so, today started off great.  i got up at my usual time of 4am, so that i can open the gym today.  i was excited that i had enough towels for everyone.  plus, my favorite client came in today.  while at work, i also got some of my homework done that was not even due until next week.  afterward, i came home and jogged around the block, got in my 2 hour nap and was then ready for class....which i didn't fall asleep in it today.  so far, so good.  after class, i went to get my car inspected and this is where my day went downhill.  i was hoping to get out of there with a $15 charge.  to my surprise, i get to buy 2 new tires before they will let my car pass inspection.  now thats about $150-$175 bill i wasn't expecting.  now i'm not sure if i'll go get a new watch, but we'll see. luckily, the day ended good because i got to work kroger tonight with my dad.  afterward i went to the gym and saw everyone there....plus i got in a great workout.  i even made it home just in time to see "the family guy," which was a hilarious episode tonight. the end.

       So there is this big guy (I mean absolutely huge man) in most of my classes and he is in my 7:30 class Tuesday and Thursday. Well today "little" stinky (our nickname for him) was really having a hard time staying awake. This is nothing new because he normally snores during class but it was unusually loud and obvious today. Well he sits in front of me and he was doing the whole sway thing that happens when you sleep sitting up. I think my life flashed before my eyes because I thought he was going to fall out of his chair this morning. I almost laughed but I held it back.   In other funny things that really aren't funny I was part of a conspiracy to set off the alarms in the library. Now our offices are in the library and so we have to walk through those sensors that set off an alarm if you have a book that hasn't been checked out. Well there is a boy who copies all of our answers and doesn't do any real work so yesterday "they" (a party that will remain unnamed- I didn't do it although I knew about it) slipped a small book (more like a phaphlet) in his book bag among a bunch of papers. Now we didn't get to see him leave last night but we did follow him out this afternoon and we almost died when the alarm went off. We had to go back up the stairs before he saw us to keep our identities unknown but the best part of the whole thing is that it hasn't occurred to him that there is something in his bag he thinks it is the bag itself which had never before in 6 months set off the alarm. Well they will let anyone in grad school- I mean they let me in.   Last Item and I know this is a totally long blog. I am giving up alcohol for Lent so since it is fat Tuesday I am going out with the girls and we are going to have a blast because although I can go out I will not be able to drink for 40 days. Its worth it just to keep up the support for everyone else and of course its for a great reason by itself!  HAPPY MARDI GRAS EVERYONE!!!

       So I was walking to class today and I saw the strangest thing. There was this guy riding his bike towards me and I could have sworn that it was Brendan. From a ways away all I could see was the ears sticking out and I was like "what in the world." I knew Brendan was at MIT but this kid looked just like him. Of course as he got close I knew the head wasn't big enough and the face was all wrong but by looking at his ears I thought "That has to be a Wells." I have great news for all of those concerned about my roomie situation (the 40 something Filipino wife and mother of two living in my room). Geraldine will be returning to the Philippines next Monday so hopefully I will have my own room for the rest of the semester. I will miss her some but having my own room definently outweigh the loss of such a nice person. In other news I am incredibly busy in school and I am wondering why I am here. Not really, this beats working anyday but wow are they piling it on! My spring break plans are still up in the air but I think someone is putting a bid in on my parent's house so I am thinking I should go home and throw about half my stuff away so when they move they don't have to do it for me. I don't know when I am going to make it to VA but I will sometime I promise.

       so this weekend has been great thus far.  so many people came in from out of town, like chrissy, birdy, chad and a surprise guest....walter.  i thank all who came out on friday night.  if it wasnt for yous guys, then it wouldnt have been a party.  i still have some cheese left....let me know if anyone wants to come over and help me eat it.   well, saturday was also filled with fun.  though i worked 5 hours at the crc, i helped pass the time via watching college bball.  man was it good today....did you see that syracuse game....mcnamara scored the game winning point in like the last .03 seconds of the game.   good stuff (can you tell i'm excited).  anyway, afterward i meet up with chrissy and gang in good ol radford.  we hit up bt's and even walked across ru campus to get to a party.  where i must say that chrissy and i crushed everyone at darts.  good times.  good times.

       So this is my first ever drunken blog and yes it is after 3:30 because our bars stay open until 3 in Indiana... I love this place. I went out with a totally different group tonight.. Two hokies in the bunch besides me :)...I am like the bastard stepchild with Whitney and Leatta gone for the weekend. I don't have anyone to take me out :(. Anyway I think I may have found a roomie for next year. No one could ever be as great as Tiff but this girl is the girlfriend of one of my TA's and she is super cool and she needs a roomie and so do I, so I think it will work. I just have to say that Jake's ran out of Hotdogs and that put a big damper on the night but I did get some great peanuts and I threw the shells into a womanizer's drink. It was great fun. Well I really should hit the hay so until I regain consciousness this is Jody being drunk and fun and needing to sleep!

       So yesterday I started to blog but was sidetracked by a meeting then it was dinner at Logan's and Margarita Mayhem so I thought all of you would understand my lack of blogging. I don't even know what I was going to say but let me tell you we had some fun last night. We stared out making some strong daiquiris. Then they moved on to margaritas (I stuck with water as I was driving) but we didn't have much mix so six of us piled in a pickup and went to the liquor store for more mix. All in all it was a great night but class this morning was rough for a few of the Mayhemers. Anyway I am going to see the Moscow Radio Orchestra tonight so it should be fun and then we may end up with another night of Madness!

       As we get farther into the semester there seems to be more work to get done before the end. This however is opposite of how I feel. The farther into the semester the less I feel like doing. Unfortunately my professors don't really understand how I feel and therefore make more work and more tests. I however have been having a great week for putting off work. I had a test and homework due both on Thursday and they have both been put back to next week which is great for me today but really bad for me next week because you know that I'm not going to start studying until I have to. This just adds to next week's work but rather than trying to get things done early I am enjoying the free time that was added to my week this week and I will have to work doublely hard next week. Oh well you do what you have to when you have to.   Michelle, I am glad you are home but I am with you on not being back spirtitually.

       Today I got back the math test that I didn't study for. I got a 69 which is a C so I'm cool but what upset me about the whole deal was that my teacher white-outed our grades and regraded because she thought our grades were too high. She cut me 5 points total the second time, four of which were because I can't add. She had already taken a point off then she went back and took four more! I did everything else right I just can't add! You think they wouldn't penalize me for messing up something I learned 17 years ago. That's a long time to remember how to do something! Just because you do it every day, they think you should remember. I no longer like my math teacher! Other than that, I am having a nice day and I hope everyone is too! (Lots of leftover Valentines candy!)

       jody-now that you mention it.  we did fill those "little blue pills" to all our regular customers on vday.  plus, i watched people stare at the case in front of the pharmacy, which held the trojans.  my next thrill will be to watch to see how many girls come in to buy pregnancy tests.

       What I forgot about our adventure to the mall was when I was trying to buy a pair of jeans at old navy, the girl checking us out asked for ID with my check card. That was cool so I showed her my drivers license and she goes "Oh my god, your from Montana? Where at?" Turns out she is from Montana too. Who would have guess that the only two people from Montana east of the Mississippi would meet in Old Navy?  I also would like to say Happy Vday to everyone. I am fortunate to have great friends who took me out to lunch today which was almost ruined by the waitress when she asked if the check would be split two and one. There is nothing like being reminded that you are single on Valentines to make you feel great about yourself! Other than that it has been a very successful day of sleeping. That's all I have done today and I am very proud of myself for it.   Tiff- I hope you have a lot of fun watching the florists today but I think you may be busy filling prescriptions for little blue pills!

       as much as i hate working weekends at kroger.  i am acutally looking forward to working tomorrow.  being that it's vday, i will hopefully get to sit back and watch the people in the floral department run around frantic all day making/selling roses to those guys who waited until the last minute.  so, i thank you guys for waiting until the bitter end to buy those roses, so as to give me some amusement.

       So after skipping out of work early to go shopping with Whitney, we were driving back from the mall and who is stuck in traffic behind us but the blue eyed wonder and our most favorite waiter from Applebee's, Bo. We entertained ourselves for a good ten minutes just watching him and also the guy next to us that was totally picking his nose. It was so gross I didn't know a finger could go that far up a nose. But the highlight of the day was Bo and seeing him driving around in his awesome new pickup that I am proud to say that I probably helped pay for! Too bad its not me driving it. Any way Happy Vday to everyone!

       i know this is a little late, but let me say that last nights bball game was phenomenal.  it was like watching a game of street ball.  i dont think i've ever seen so much pushing, shoving, or fighting at a game before.  sure, i'd expect it more from hockey, but not bball.  not only did we stay a good 10 points ahead the whole game and win by almost 20 points....i also came home with a free t-shirt.  granted i will never wear this shirt b/c it's a small dress for me, but it was free.  how could i refuse.  at least my dad will now have a new vt shirt to add to his collection.   have fun in cali michelle.

       A blog faux pas: I have to admit to the mistake that I made.... I apologize for posting my last blog twice (although it is now deleted). I recognized a spelling error just as I started to publish and went to correct it... but it was too late... the little people inside my computer had already posted the incorrect and then the following corrected blog. Please accept my sincerest apologizes to those of you who had to read the blog twice. [please don't retract my blog privileges... i will use my time away to think about what i have done :)]

I guess you should try to resist that irresistible spider next time!

       Despite all of the support I got for not studying, I may not have done as well on the test as I should have. I thought I did great and then she sent out the answers and things went down hill from there. I do appreciate the love though. Michelle, I hope you have the bestest time in Cali. I wish I could be going with you!   In other news this has been like the longest week of my life and I don't want to do anything for the rest of the week so I spent several hours this morning reading  urlLink THIS.  It was totally awesome and funny but I didn't enjoy the ending very much. Sounds a lot like something some boys I know would do to someone (apt 245). It could be newest experiment but I think they would have to set up Brendan which could prove difficult since he is at MIT with a bunch of smart people. Just an idea boys.   While we are on the subject of Apt 245. I have to say that I have been disappointed with the amount of blogs. I mean going a week between doesn't win you any points and what the heck was with that "thing" John posted it was awful. I would also like to know where Sean found his because it wasn't much better. I have to say if it was a war we should win for lack of amazingly stupid things posted!

       why study for that test?  i mean you did go to class.  you should already know the material.  they are are just testing you to see if you were paying attention.  i mean, i've used that same logic in other classes i've taken.  in fact, i used it just the other day.     oh, has anyone noticed the new water fountains in wallace hall?  of all the things to improve and update on campus, does it have to be water fountains?

I'm very pleased to share that I will be enjoying the sunny LA weather with the pleasant company of such characters as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and if I'm lucky, none other than the adorable Piglet. If you have any messages for my kind friends let me know and I will pass them on during my visit... and note to Jody- i am so with you on the spider solitaire... definitely the way to go

       So I am getting ready to go take a test in my undergrad math class and I am preparing by not doing anything at all. I am only taking it pass fail so its not really a big deal but at the same time I do feel like a lazy bum who should actually study. I am torn but I know in my heart that spider solitare is going to win this battle and I will not study. Oh spider solitare, why will you not let me study?

       So much has happened! I went to the liquidity preference function and ended up staying out 9.5 hours that night drinking and playing pool. At one point people were looking down my shirt as I made my shots but I didn't care. Later that evening I took a drink out of a random guys hand and took a drink. I don't know what I was thinking but we sure had a good time. The best part is we are planning to do it again in two weeks!  I have to say that there is a new email up on the homestarrunner website and now I am happy!  I am truly proud of you Tiff for watching a girly movie. I don't know what Michelle had to do to get you to do it but Good Job Michelle!

       As I was leaving the gym (mccomas) this even, I had a revelation.  I would have to say that I saw a glimpse of hokie heaven.  When I first stepped outside the doors of mccomas, I immediately saw the soccer field.  Directly behind it was stood the mighty lane stadium.  As I rounded the corner, there was the wondrous cassell coliseum.  All were standing under a sky full of shining stars.  I was in heaven just thinking of all the sporting events that have taken place and all the times I was there to witness its glory.  If this isn’t hokie heaven, then I don’t know what is.

       so last night was full of indecisiveness.  michelle and i could not figure out what to do with ourselves.  it came down to the point that i called on other people to just tell us what to do.  and thank you for helping to make up our minds.  if it weren't for you, we probably would still be sitting by our computers.   yes, i admit i watched a girly movie..."how to lose a guy in 10 days."  it was funny.  one of my favorite quotes was, "women in lust want chocolate, women in love want diamonds."    to end a great night, i had to get my car stuck in michelles parking lot.  though we may be female, that didnt stop us from using our resources to get me unstuck.  but, if you're going to get stuck somewhere...i suggest michelle's place.  b/c you never know whats going to happen.

       Another note:  Thank you Tiff for clearing up my indecisiveness last night! Good times. You need to share your new favorite quote with the world... Just for the record Tiffany watched a girly movie last night... she even picked it out... yes the Tiffany we all know and love and depend on to be one of the few girls on the planet that only watches guy movies actually enjoyed a chick flick! Mark your calendars :)

       Very Important info for Verizon customers!!!  They have created a new calling plan with unlimited in network calling(this means mobile to mobile)!!! The price, all the traditional daytime minutes and free nights and weekends are the same.  My life is changed forever with the news that  I can talk mobile to mobile in an unlimited amount... What a great day this is in verizon history! :)

       As an economist I feel it is my duty to participate in studies about economics,to further the cause of course. So tonight I will be attending the Liquidity Preference Function at Brothers Bar. Its is being sponsored by one of my professors and the associate department head. They will be buying the first few rounds to find out what the average graduate student's liquidity preference is.  This is going to be a difficult task for me, but I will be attending to do my scientific duty. If all of my duties were this difficult I don't know what I would do. Maybe stay in school forever! Wish me luck!

       I do declare by my rights as a member of this blog and a ruler of this not so free world that every Wednesday will from here until I get tired of it, shall be known as Happy Day and shall be celebrated by going out and having atleast one drink, an appetizer and desert at your favorite restaraunt (I recommend Applebees in West Lafayette because of the cute boys that work there). Happy Day is a celebration of the fact that Wednesday is hump day and making it through Wednesdays means you are that much closer to the weekend. Let it be done.

       the funniest thing happened today.  as i'm in the process of parking my car for my 8am class.  i glance over at the girl in the suv try to drive and park at the same time.  afterward, she opens her door and "wham!"  she falls straight to the ground.  one leg was still inside the vehicle, while the rest of her body was dangling outside and on the ground.  i couldn't help but laugh.  but i made certain that i turned my head so she didn't see that i was laughing at her.

       I am truly disappointed in Strongbad. There has been no new email this week and I just don't know what to do with myself. How am I supposed to be a loyal fan if there isn't anything new. I have watched all the other emails repeatedly and I need a new one! My entire week has been destroyed by the lack of a new email. Do the creators of Homestarrunner realize what they are doing? This could be the end of me!

       how about that super bowl?  one of the best games i've seen in years.  however, all the talk is focused on the halftime show.  which i watched, but happened to look away at that exact moment when justin tore off janet's top.  luckily for me, the wonderful news people replaid the event over and over. oh, thanks for the congrats on winning in the pool.  i actually had no idea until  after the game that i had won b/c i left my print out.  sorry, sean that i stole 2nd quarter from you.    oh, those of you around the burg.  don't forget to get your "another non-smoking hokie t-shirt."  i went and picked mine up today.  i wanted the blue one, but just as i was to go in, they ran out of my size.  so i settled for the black.  i'll just have to wait until next year for the blue.

       Cutos to Tiff for her amazing ability to win things. She took home not one but two of the winning places in the BWIA super bowl pool. I am a little upset that I didn't win but I guess I will just have to blame Brendan who choose my squares for me. Bad Brendan! Bad! Oh well.  I am remembering why it was I didn't want to go back to school. They expect me to work! Of course I guess it is better than actually working but still, who gives 50 review questions in math and then says turn them in? I don't know about this place.  Michelle- Pinnapple on Pizza is the only way to go. It's sweet and tangy and damn it, it just tastes good!

       currently the word is that it's supposed to get pretty icy tonight.  thus, i decided on my way home from the gym to pick up a few items from kroger.  these were: milk, bread, chicken, and cheese.  now why in the world i decide it's a good idea to buy mostly frozen/refrigerated items on a night that could lead to power outages...thus spoiling my food.  i don't know.  but at the time it seemed like a good idea.     oh, michelle is right in that pineapple on pizza is good.  try it, like it, love it.

       today i had to make a trip to the vt library.  now if you know me at all, you know i never step foot in buildings such as these b/c (1) i dont read and (2) i dont read.  the only reasons i would ever come here would be to (1) get out of the weather to get to another building (2) look up an article...which is rare (3) b/c i have nothing better to do w/ my time....which is rare (4) use the restroom or (5) check my email.  anyway, my purpose today was to locate an article i needed to read for  a homework assignment.  being that i have had to locate other similar types of journal articles before, i knew exactly where to go and what to do.  thus my time spent here would be as short as possible.  on my way out, i noticed something.  people were actually sitting at tables w/ books.  it appeared that they were reading them.  maybe even learning from them.  i almost felt like stopping to ask one of the poor souls what he was doing, but i could not.  it would have been like i was interrupting in some spiritual act or something.  i must conclude that they were studying.  "so this is what it looks like."   well, looks like i've seen enough studying for one day.  im going to stop now and go do nothing.  i feel i'm straining my brain too hard....just writing this.

       Ok Ladies Sorry for my lack of blogging but I hope to make up for it in one HUGE blog. Here goes...  Tiff... I don't know where you found that thing about standing up but what a concept. Its one of those things you would never admit to trying but if possible you could never go back to sitting down.  My roommate has now requested (by email because she is too "shy" to say it to me in person) that we make night times free of any music playing as much as possible (or I could use earphones). I was so shocked at such a request, mostly because I tend to study with my music louder than I was playing it last night, I didn't know what to say but I am sure I will think of something or if you all have any ideas please let me know.  My parents have now sold our house in Montana and are in Oklahoma looking for a new one. I do hope that Oklahoma exists unlike Montana which was something we all just made up (right Adam). I'm not sure that I want to be from Oklahoma but I am sure that I will get used to it in time.   When was the last time you went to a slumber party? Well my friends are having one and it is going to be a blast. Not only do we get to watch girlie movies and do each others makeovers but I have a feeling there is going to be a lot of alcohol consumed. We may even get a video camera so we can show boys we don't have pillow fights in our underwear... or maybe we will just "edit" it out by staging it and cutting it out of the video. We are also planning pranks for the neighbors that we know and we could have a lot of fun with that.   I think this is my last thing. We are going on a farm tour set up by one of our friends in the department. It should be a blast when most of the people leave and we have burgers and beer by a bonfire. It should also be interesting to see the different types of Ag in this area but mostly we are looking forward to the bonfire at the end. I however will not be drinking as lent is not over until Sunday and we will be drinking on Saturday.

       attention all females.  do you find yourself at bars, parties, amusement parks, or just in general taking forever to use the restroom b/c you have to wait in a 20 minute line.  have you ever been out in nature with the sudden urge to go and you have to end up hiking 2 miles to get out of sight of all pass byers.  today is a new day.  today you can learn how to  urlLink pee standing up .  with a little bit of time, you too can be sharing a urinal w/ your male cohorts.  though i've yet to try this, it does seem promising and the results would be endless.

       so, lately i've taken up reading.  yes, the girl who never reads for fun....or at all for that matter....and will only know the storyline if a movie is made from it.  however, times have changed and i've somehow ran out of things to think about for 30minutes, while i'm on the cross trainer.  though i can watch tv, most of the time someone else has beaten me to it and the news is on.  theres only so much news i can handle reading.  thus, i read now, but only during my cardio workouts....nothing outside of that.  now, that 30 minutes just flys by....i'm loving it.  oh, the book of choice is entitled "1st to Die" by James Patterson.  it's pretty good.  what i've gotten out of it so far is that this crazy guy goes around and kills newly married couples.  right now im on the mission of linking 3 murders together....why can't the police just see what i see.  guess thats part of the mystery and i'll have to read more to find out.

       Well I haven't seen Supertroopers yet but if you are looking for a total chick flick its Under the Tuscan Sun. It was pretty good. So I got my test back and I wasn't too excited. I made a 79 which was above the average but much below the 100 that Carlos got. If I didn't like him so much for writing the entire group finance paper I may have been upset. I guess I will have to study more for next time.   By the way: there is another week and two days until lent is over. Can you say Party Time? However I am on DD duty for the rest of the weekend because it looks like it could get a little rowdy in West Lafayette.   Michelle- I hope you feel better. Eat some soup and get some rest girl.

       I am happy to announce that I have made it back to Indiana safe and sound. I however did little but sit in a car all week. I drove over 3100 miles in 8 days and if I don't have to go anywhere for a while its okay with me. I enjoyed the little time I spent with the fam and I did get to go to a party while I was home. Of course because its still Lent I didn't get to drink and I had to drive home a bunch of kids who weren't even legal to be drinking. Atleast I got hit on by some younger boys (I wouldn't call them men even though they were 19). All in all it was a pretty good week and I can now tell you every road you have to take to get from West Lafayette IN to Miles City MT. I didn't even use the map when I came back. I am glad to say that the weather was great and it didn't snow in Montana so HA for all of you that had snow over spring break. I never enjoy comming back to a bunch of work so I was really happy that my group had most of my project done and they don't really need my help so I just have to focus on my five million other projects.

There is just no telling what we'll get ourselves into! A great job rocking out goes to Liberation Jumpsuit :) Tiff- I enjoyed the enlightening conversation... very few could make me jump for joy in the middle of a crowded room (ok so maybe that part isn't so true...) Thank you and good night to all of you beautiful people who made my day great!

       so i just got back from visiting elaine.  of course good times were had.  granted, we didn't drag race or sing karaoke....we had a blast.  this time, our fun was geared more towards chillin'.  there was good eating (thanks to elaine), sleeping more than 5 hours a night, and as much bball watching i could get in.  we even went and saw "eurotrip," which was hilarious.  *scotty doesnt know, scotty doesnt know*     i also had elaine do the annual hair dying thing.  except this year we got a head start b/c it usually takes place in aug at williamsburg.  oh well.  fyi: the color was a little loud when it was first done.  so, believe it or not, washing my hair with dawn dish washing soap helped to tone the color down.    oh, will someone please explain this to me.  on my drive home, at least half of the truck drivers honked their horn at me.  it wasnt the really loud one like the train whistle, but it sounded more like one that would come from pressing on the steering wheel.  anyway, at first i thought i was just hearing things, but once this same noise kept occuring all on I-64 and I-81, i figured something was up.  i almost thought something was wrong w/ my car.  but i knew the trunk was closed b/c it had yet to pop open on me. i knew my tires were in good shape b/c they were brand new.  all i could figure was that some trucker decided to radio ahead all his buddies to honk at me when they saw me pass.  but why me????  not that i really cared, but it was odd.

       So I took another math test today that I actually kinda studied for but I think I actually did worse on this one. On the bright side there is three more classes and one more test and then I am going home. Of course it wont be the fun spring break that I planned when I thought I was going back to VT, but you guys have snow and that isn't cool so I am going someplace warmer (strangely enough Montana.) Its going to take me two days to get there but I really don't know that I want to stop so I may just drive right through and sleep on the side of the road a couple times. Just don't tell my dad. He would freak out!   Anyways, we are hosting a couple new recruits for the department. They are having dinner with us on Thursday night and then we are going to take them out and show them what West Lafayette has to offer. Not much really but there is free hotdogs and peanuts. I just hope that they will be fun.

       i dont really know what to tell you to do jody.  but drying your hair in the room during the early morning hours is a good start.  especially if shes still in bed and it will bother her to no end.  but all i have to say is im glad i stayed on your good side.  heheh.  but give some time and i'm sure i'll have a few ideas to help you out.  on another topic.  ive had a horrible experience at walmart and target the past few days.  i first went to walmart to buy some foundation.  well, they were out of what i use....loreal's airwear.  anyway, so i was talking w/ elaine on the phone while i'm shopping for this item and she tells me she gets it at target.  so, the following day i go to target in hopes of getting it there.  strike two.  they dont have it either.  so, now im confussed b/c im wondering why did they take it off the market b/c they just put this item out only a few years ago.  plus, i know that they have it at my kroger b/c i saw it there the other day.  i only went to walmart to get it b/c i knew it was going to be cheaper.  well, while im at work tonight i decide to go ahead and get the foundation at kroger.  its gone there too.  im not sure if they finally sold out of it or they just took it off the shelves.  the only good thing that will come out of this, is a girl bonding experience that elaine and i can have when i make her take me to the store and help me pick out a new foundation.  for you guys out there....you have no idea what we girls go through to pick this stuff out.  getting the right color and right chemical combo.  oh, should it be oil free, wrinkle free, line free, etc.........the things we go through.

       So I know that my last roomie wasn't really as bad as I made her out to be, she was just a lot different from me (two kids and a husband along with being from another country) but now I think I have found what looks to be about number two on my worst roomie list. She is another filipina and I thought I would like her until my family called tonight. Roomie was on the phone so she answered it and without even asking who it was or if it was important said "could you call back later, I am on the phone." Now I am sitting right next to her and I thought it was one of her friends because she didn't even ask who it was or if I could call them later or anything. So I was pretty surprised when my cell rang and my little sis asked "is she always that rude?" So now I have a decision to make and being that I am apparently not a good person and I like getting people back especially when they do rude things to my family, I have to decide what action to take, if any. Now my first thought is how much I am going to miss drying my hair in my room because its really a pain to have to go to the bathroom every morning just to dry my hair and I never take everything I need so I always end up taking a few trips so I think I will be drying my hair in my room regardless of who is here with me. This usually happens at 8 MWF and around 7 TTH mornings. I know it isn't nice and I can think of a hundred reasons why not to but I just can't tolerate rude behavior, especially when she didn't even ask if it was important or who it was. Maybe its the lack of alcohol that is making me mean but if you have any suggestions about things I can do, I am all ears.

       I received news this week that has me rather distressed. Due to the large amount of snow days, Radford City Schools took away days from spring break. This means they only get a Thurs. and Fri. off. I operate the studio on the school system schedule so without the full spring break I can not go to California when I had planned. I am VERY disappointed! I had really fun and important stuff planned. :( This is very sad in the world of me. If you have any brilliant ideas, let me know...

       So I am a little disappointed with our  urlLink brother site.  They are falling way down on the job with their lack of blogs. I mean really, if we can find the time to write a little something now and then, I think that they should be able to take time out of their "busy" schedules and write a sentence or two. I mean Adam rarely goes to class so why can't he write when he is supposed to be there. All John does is play on computers all day, so no problem there. Brendan thinks he is busy with his Masters but hey, so am I. Sean I will give a break. Being a marine can be a tough job. Really I see no reason why those slackers can't write once in a while. So if you are one of the previously noted slackers and you are reading this,  write in your own blog !!! Kudos to my girls for keeping with it!

       speaking of math. im taking this survey of accounting class. never in my life have i had such a class. today was one of the first days that i actually went into class and i felt like i knew what was going on. maybe it had something to due w/ the fact that i had one of my higher level accounting friends go over the chapter w/ me. :)   well, i am now official on spring break. the first thing i did was to make 2 batches of rice krispie treats. so, if you're hungery....come on over. the second thing i plan on doing is taking a jog around the burg. that way i can feel like i earned the right to eat one of my "treats." from there on out, my break will consist of working, working out, working, and visiting elaine. oh, i should wash my car too....the rain we had the other day just didn't do enough.

       So I have the cutest math teacher ever! She is Korean and she just really want's our class to love her. I had some questions on my homework so I went to her office and she offered me juice. How sweet is that. I only spent about 10 minutes getting help on homework and I spent another half an hour just talking to her about our class and how we give no response at all when she talkes to us. Get this I am in a class with 80% FRESHMEN! Makes me feel really great! I do like her even though in a previous post I cussed her for giving low grades.  She also told me that it was a waste of my time to be in her class and that I didn't need to do all of the work she assigned because I would probably pass anyway. I like her more and more everyday.

       Yesterday I saw the funniest thing... Two boys riding a mo-ped up and down State street (main drag in West Lafayette). Just imagine two grown boys on one of those tiny clown motorcycles. The best part was the fact that they kept getting stopped at red lights and they would have to work to get the thing moving again with all of their weight. It sounded like a bumble bee on crack!

       So get this: our teacher missed a class and had her TA come in and work some problems with us which was great and really helpful but she is making us do a make up class tonight. That is soooo not cool. I don't even care that she is buying us all pizza. I still shouldn't have to come to an extra class because she couldn't be at one. Man I am a whiner. Well atleast I get free pizza. Montana here I come in.... two weeks!

       First of all thanks for all of the support. I appreciate it. It has been difficult without any alcohol. I never realized how often I have a beer when we are hanging out or a glass of wine with dinner. It didn't really help that cute boys were putting it in my face saying "awe come on you want some!" Yes I do but I will not!  Anyways: I realize I haven't blogged all weekend so I have so much to share.. well not really but it is cool to me. 1. My room is on the 10th floor and there is a parking garage out my window so I can see the top which is open and Saturday morning I looked out and there was a police car sitting there all by itself. I thought it was strange but maybe he had taken someone to their car and was doing something but when I looked back ten minutes later he was still there. I thought he could be doing two things... taking a nap or abusing his authority. I think he was taking a nap because it was almost 30 minutes later before he left. I fought the impulse to call the police and ask if there was something wrong and get him in trouble but now I know to look out for him.  2. I am officially roomie less for the time being. I know of one girl who is moving and I am really hoping that she moves somewhere else. Not that she isn't nice but man I like drying my hair in my room in the morning. I was a little sad to see my roomie leave. She was a really nice lady but not what you want in a roomie while in college. I would come home at midnight and she would ask if I had been reviewing. I would just say yeah. But there was a going away party for her and I meet some nice people in the community and supposedly a couple is going to call me and have me out for dinner. They have a son around my age so who knows it may work out alright. Plus its great to have someone fix a meal for you.  3. I had the best intentions to do work this weekend but somehow I only got done what was due today so I would say that I am going to work hard this week but we all know that I will just manage to slip by. I would like to thank my sis for being a great distraction and talking to me for over an hour each day while I was in my office. Its great when someone gives you a way to be distracted instead of having to make your own.  Well that's all for me for today but I am going to be having dinner with the boys that were at Sangria Spectacular on Thursday so hopefully I will have something great to report back.

       jody all i have to say is "you can do it."  count down the days, it's the only way you'll know when you're almost done.  oh, i wouldnt worry about that test.  for crying out loud it was at 730am.  who gives a test that early anyway.  8am are bad enough.  besides you can make up for it on the next one.  to make you feel better, i'm in the same vote...go figure.    michelle, i'm so glad we were both in a pizza mood last night.  it really hit the spot. oh, i need to finish watching season 1 of friends sometime.     yes, the person who rarely eats pizza ate one last night.  and i will be finishing the rest off today.  but that just means tomorrow i get to start my 3 day diet.  dont ask.  remember how i got that box of cereal for the sole purpose of the toy.  well, i decided to get another one.  i am now the proud owner of 2 donald ducks.  i really want the complete set....donald, mickey, minnie, and goofy.  but theres really only so much cereal i can eat before its over.  so ive decided to buy some rice krispies to make rice krispie treats.  hopefully, it wont be too long before i have them all.

       So I am getting ready to take my Ag finance final and I have come to the realization that I know absolutely nothing about ag finance. I feel like my head is going to explode after studying for an entire day. I hate finals especially when they are comprehensive and all equasions and you don't get a note card or anything. This totally blows and I can't wait until 9pm tonight when I will be done with finals for a couple of months. Hope everyone else has a great week and I have funny stuff to share but I have to go take my test now. Later!

       i'm so excited.  the local drive-in opens sooner than i expected....may 13th.  the first showing of the year will be "home on the range."  i really dont want to see that one, so i may skip it that week.  which will be okay because that is also the same weekend of vt's graduation and i'm sure there will be tons of parties and things to do.  anyway, the following week, may 21st, they are showing starsky and hutch...which was funny.  the weekend of may 28th is 50 first dates.  so, if you want to find me this summer, i'll be at the drive-in on the weekends.

       so this guy comes into the drug store with a rx for a very expensive antibiotic.  anyway, he was on his cell phone and usually i hate and give little consideration to those who come up to me w/ those things.  i figure they don't care about me, why should i them.  anywho, for some reason, i didn't care.  maybe it was the fact we were so slow that i actually looked forward to someone coming to visit me--plus it helped that the guy was funny and half way attractive.  in the process, he discovers his rx is going to cost him $50.  so hes like "hold off on that, i'm going to see if i cant get some samples."  thus, he makes another phone call at my counter.  after he conversed w/ someone he knew on the other line, they determined that the medicine was not worth it.  therefore, he decided to just stay sick.  however, after he left me, i spotted him at the u-scan w/ a 24 pack of miller light.  i guess he found another cure for his cold.  hehe.

       So I'm finally doing it. I am going back to tech to visit. So far my (tenative) itinerary is that I will arrive sometime on the 13th of May, go to Julie's graduation on the 14th, Michelle's wine and cheese party on the 15th and leave sometime on the 16th. If you would like to be scheduled in let me know. I will be staying with Tiff if that's still alright with her. I would love to see all of you hokies while I'm there so let me know what's going on. You can email me at my new spiffy Purdue email at jwelsh@purdue.edu. Can't wait to see you all but I really should be study macroeconomics for my final tomorrow rather than writing this.

I am going to miss everyone and realistically HOW do you think you can pass up a FREE place to stay in the most AMAZING place ever! SUNNY CALI! Just think about that for a minute... Truly reflect and then get back to me on that one... I mean really...Tiffany is doing it, everyone is doing it, why aren't you?! Do Not confuse this with peer pressure and let me know when to expect you!

       So I signed a lease on an awesome apartment. I can't wait to move in but I have another month before that will happen. School is almost over and finals really suck as do projects. Hopefully I will get everything done before the end of the semester. Not much else is happening around West Lafayette except that my softball team make the playoffs which is pretty cool. Other than that, I hope everyone is doing great and good luck on your finals if you have them.

       If anyone is wondering... when comming off a sober streak, you should not drink a bunch of hard alcohol. It makes you sick and it isn't fun. It also looks bad when you can't move the next moring and you were supposed to help with an event. All I know is I won't do that again. Probably because I won't give up alcohol again but I think I will stick to beer for a while. I definentally will be on beer at 7 Saturday morning when we do breakfast club before the grand prix. You have to love a town where the bars open at 7am so you can get drunk before their events.

       so, i decided to hit up the salad bar at kroger for my evening dinner.  now, whenever i choose to go this route i always get a salad--hince the "salad" bar--and sometimes tuna.  today, after i made my salad w/ romaine lettuce, cheese, carrots, cucumbers, and sunflower seeds; i spotted something i hadnt had in forever....green stuff.  at least thats what my family calls it.  in case you're wondering, green stuff is nothing more than cool whip, cottage cheese, pineapple, and lime jello mix.  well, i dont know what kroger did to their green stuff, but it had a kick.  to me it was spicy, but no so hot and spicy; but spicy like pepper.  it was weird, but should i expect anything less from krogers deli.  though it tasted different than the norm, that did not stop me from eating it.  i figure if i shouldnt have eaten it, then i'll find out later tonight or tomorrow.  you can call me "sam."

       in case you didn't know, i had lost my water bottle about 2 wks ago.  i was traumatized.  it was my favorite bottle and i didn't know what to do w/ myself.  i checked every place that it could possibly be at....car, home, kroger, and the gym.  no where to be found.  my solution to finding the lost bottle was for me to go and buy a new one.  luckily, i did not have to do that b/c i found it the other day.  oh happy day it was.  (it's the little things that get me)  in other news: last night was fun.  miss lindsey (from my htm lab) had an over abundance amount of money on her meal plan.  thus, she took me and several other people out to fine dinning at the dbh.  being that we all cook there, ourselves, we knew exactly what to get and what it should look like.  the fun didnt stop there....afterward i got them to come out to hokie house w/ me for comedy club.  i even convinced one girl earlier on in the day to skip class and work on her paper, so that she could come out later.  overall, the comedians were not that great....i felt like leaving, but i knew it would all be over soon.  plus i didnt want to go home....everyone was out.  at least lots of people that i knew.  anyway, through conversation lindsey and i discovered that we are both going to be here this summer.  you know what that means...trouble.  we are both bad influences on each other or can be.  one highlight of the night was winning at air hockey....hehe.

       So the end of the school year kinda sucks because everything is due and you have to take tests. I got one back on Tuesday (big ole 69) and I took another today. I am really tired of my undergrad math class and I have not been going atleast once a week and so when I took my test today I was a little lost but why should I work hard on that when I only have to pass? Why oh Why did I come back to school? Oh yeah, I don't like to work.  This Saturday is the big spring fest for Purdue. I am going to give demonstrations on using GPS and selling carmeled apples. I had never used GPS until yesterday afternoon but no biggie. The biggest wonder for me is how I am going to make it there before 8 in the morning as lent is over and I can drink again so Friday night is going to be a fun night but I don't know how fun Saturday morning is going to be. Well atleast I made it the full time. Thats more than I can say for all the people around me who are still chewing and smoking and eating sweets (which I personally couldn't have given up). I win they loose. Just like when we graduated and we had to go out every night for 20 nights before graduation. Brendan and I won and everyone else lost! I'm really not competitive at all.

       So sad that I missed all of the fun! Michelle- I am so sad that you are leaving but I know you will have a blast in Cali.  I finally found a place to live and I keep thinking less than a month and the roomie from hell will leave. I guess I was just around more this weekend than usual but she was totally on my nerves. Then we had a fire alarm go off around 8pm last night and running down ten flights of stairs with really slow people in front of you is not fun. Especially when two weeks ago a dorm I used to live in burned down so I was a little freaked out and was a little upset when people were like "Usually it stops by the time I get to the bottom" as that in itself is a reason to go really slow. And then a girl was mad because the RA woke her up and made her get out. I mean don't these people understand that if there was a fire that RA just saved their life? I really need to get out of the dorms.   Anyway hope everyone had a great Easter. Tiff- I missed the family this year! Tell all of them I said HI!

       Good times indeed!  Hokie House most certainly brought out the 'awww' in Tiff and I.  Small factual correction however.... I was the Observer as everyone used there successful/unsuccessful pick up lines (who's to judge...who actually wanted them to work?) :)  ...and truly, there is nothing better than a hardee's biscuit at 2:30 in the morning. Mike really was excellent at his job of getting us more for less. Go Mike!  Cheers

       good friday....indeed it was.  as soon as i got off work i called up the troops.  michelle and mike were on there way, here, my place.  the evening started off a little slow, but as soon as mike had poured us our 3rd shot, things began to pick up.  the music was blasting, we were singing and dancing.  this only lasted till 11ish b/c we had to head downtown.  our mission.....to cause a ruckus.  being that michelle and i had not been to hokie house most of the semester, we started there.   as soon as we stepped foot in the door, memories of good times flowed through us....awww.  anyway, it was the place to be.  the usual suspects were there, martinez and sam.  as good a time as we were having there, we wanted to keep moving.  next stop, tots.  but we never even walked up the stairs to get in b/c we saw it was dead.  at this point, i've got to use the restroom.  so i suggest that we go to rivermill....plus it was right around the corner.  after our pee break, we left there.  i think we would have stayed there a little while, but it was like an oven in there.  next, mike calls up john....he's dj'ing at boudros.  at the same time, michelle and i both get calls on our phones.  so we are all walking down the block on our phones...how funny is that.  anyway, mike sweet talks the door men and they let us in a dollar off per person.  let me just say, if you want to meet locals, come to boudros b/c everyone from rhs was there.  after we all tried our pick up lines on random people, we decided to leave to get some food.  hardee's here we come.  they've got the breakfast menu up and running and man was it good.  not to mention, mike used his charm once again to get the drive thru girl to give us 2 extra biscuits.  mmmm.  finally we come home and to bed i go at 3am b/c i have to get up at 730am to get ready for a 9 hour work day and write this.  time to go, the end.

GEEZ-i think it is safe to say i am in desperate need of some days off!   so my big event for today has been beginning the official announcement of my big news...   NO i am not getting married although that has been the first response from a majority of people when i declare i have something important to say... my news is that i am moving to California in June and i am so very excited for all of the possibilities that are going to come along with it...

       So seriously two tests in two days is just way too much. The first one wasn't too bad but wow did that one this morning kick my butt. I don't know why he thought we should have questions from before the last test but apparently we are supposed to remember that stuff. All in all, every grad student I have talked to said they would be luckey to get a 60 on it. I think that is a reasonable expectation. I hate when tests ruin a perfectly good day. I am totally useless for the rest of the day. On the bright side I have a whole week before the next one. Well other than that I am playing softball tomorrow. I don't know if what I do is considered playing but I stand out there and once in a while I swing a bat so I will take it.

       Well what a slumber party! We watched movies, Saran Wrapped a boy's truck and wrote WKU (western Kentucky university) on his back window with maxi pads, sang some karaoke and everyone else had a lot to drink. We had a great time and went to bed around 2am. But at 3:15 am the boys decided it was time to wake us up again. Unfortunatly they can't just call or knock on the door they pounded on it. I thought something had exploded outside. We ended up yelling out the window at them to go home. We got up the next moring had breakfast and cleaned up then we were off to the farm tour. The best part was that Whitney and Leatta were drinking all day. We had fun and got to see a variety of things. Then we ended at Zach's shop where they had this great spread. We had burgers and hotdogs along with chips and fruit and cookies. It was awesome. We eventually ended up going bowling... I don't really know how but it was nice. We made it back to West Lafayette fairly early but we were all tired so we hit the hay. We also all have two tests this week we haven't studied for so we needed to be alive today. Of course I am writing this instead of studying so I could have probably stayed out and got just as much accomplished.

       yeah, i remember those guys.  hopefully they will "crash" the party b/c they are crazy fun.  remember, we do know from experience that if they yell out a dare/bet, they are good for their word....ie free drinks.

       Wow, I can't believe I haven't had any words of randomness for several days. It has been a bad week overall. The dorm I was an RA in in Wyoming burned down Tuesday afternoon. My sis was there and helped evacuate it then she couldn't go into her dorm because it was next door and they were afraid it would catch on fire. So needless to say its been a mess around there and just the thought of my sister being there was hard for me.   Enough of the depressing... everone is getting drunk at the slumber party tonight except me but I am getting used to not drinking. Tiff do you remember the guys who sat in front of us at the Football games when we sat with apt. 245? They are here... or atleast a few of them are. I have a funny feeling that they will be crashing the party tonight but if I remember right they were fun so it may be okay. Have a Great Weekend everyone!

       So as you can all see there is a new section called Polls. If you have any ideas for new ones let me know and we can put up new questions. I was just thinking about the stupidest idea I had heard in a long time. Of course comming from Brendan, you would think I would know better than to listen. A purse that has a zipper on both sides so when you loose things in the bottom you just turn it over and open the other side? Hello, things are on the bottom because they are heavy and if you flip the purse over they will fall to the bottom again. Really Brendan, we are glad that you are listening to our concerns but I expect more from you. What happened to the guy who had to hear a name 157 times before he remembered? I think living up at MIT has done something to you. Now going to Arizona. You better find a better girlfriend than Adam to put sunscreen on you. I know he has soft hands but he can't be with you all the time. Maybe that should be the next poll. Who should be subjected to the torture of putting sunscreen on Brendan's back?

       It was about 1100 miles and 18 hours of driving but it was soooooo worth it. I can't believe it took me a whole year to get there. Now I can't wait to go back. I had the best time and thanks to everyone especially Tiff for making it a great weekend. Now its on to Cali to see Michelle next. Tiff if you find a time that works for you about anything would work for me. Well I will blog a little more later but for right now go to  urlLink this  website and vote for Chuck Altizer. We can't let some little highschool bum beat out a Hokie.

       so jody came into town approx 6pm on thurs evening.  thus, the weekend began on thurs as soon as i got off work at 9pm.  we headed to tots to get a rail, then off to rivermill for a car bomba and a shot, then to the one and only...hokie house.  we love that place.  everyone was there as well.  we played a game a pool and talked to half the people in the joint.  fri, day 2:  jody spent most of the day w/ julie and her fam...due to the fact that julie was graduating from grad school.  i on the other hand was working at my fam's yard sale....which i got a nice little farmers tan.  fri night was full of chilling w/ the apt 245 guys.  afterward, jody and i became pool sharks at hokie house.  we ran the table and played about 3 games...we only stopped playing b/c no one else wanted to play us and ho ho's was about to close in 20 minutes.  but, it was fun beating guys, who thought they could take us girls.  sat, day 3:  we relaxed most of the day.  i took jody to say hello to my fam.  we even went to custard corner...the ice cream shop for all the locals in the area.  even took a short walk on the huckleberry, which we got more tan lines.  once the moon rose, we headed to radford...dressed in our best for the one and only wine and cheese party.  had a blast...talked w/ all the old high school gang and even met a few new people.  later out came the cards....spoon was the name of the game.  havent played that game since middle school, but it was fun.  my goal was to keep the cards moving as fast as i could to make it more difficult for everyone else.  seemed to work.  all righty, its about time for jody and i to go eat some breakfast w/ the apt 245 gang before they head out of town.  all i must say...this has been a great weekend.  congradualations grats!!

       Oh my goodness Tiff. I can't believe you almost hit another deer. I would be afraid to drive if I had almost hit two, and a bunny but that's just between us. I can't believe that you are in a pool league. That is so cool. I know you can win because we kept that table all night in HoHo's. Ball in hand is hard to deal with because you do feel like you are cheating but you can put it where you would in bar pool if it makes you feel better. Anyways, I hate statistics and I think I would die if it was my major. Have a great week!

       tonight on my way home from michelles, i took the ol path via radford road, then the shortcut onto wades rd.  everything was going smoothly and as planned.  i was just minutes away from home, when all of the sudden a huge beast jumped out in front of me.  yes, i'm talking about a deer.  however, this time it was a doe...probably about 185 pounds.  she was beautiful, but also got confussed when she saw me b/c she didnt know which way to go.  luckily, i was only driving 25mph and was able to stop inches from her, giving her time to decide how she wanted to cross the road....criss-crossed of course.  im just glad history did not repeat itself tonight.  i dont think my dad could handle me hitting a 2nd deer w/ my car.

       so, as most of you know, i'm on a pool league this summer.  we are the "dolls with balls."  i go and attempt to look like i know what im doing every wed night.  i am still having to get used to the apa rules b/c they are different from the bar rules i'm used to.  all these balls in hands makes me feel like i'm cheating when i play.  either way, it hasnt helped me out too much...i need to practice more.  also, i try to visualize my shot, but i sometimes need a 'pointer' to help me out, but apa doesnt allow that.  well next wed night we play at the local super bowl...yay.  but i must say, if the pool games get boring the atmosphere is always interesting to look at....you wouldnt believe the types of people that come out.

       wow, its been forever since i've blogged.  but i'm back for good now.  i have now moved into my new residence at 512 east main st.  it was a hard 2 weeks getting this place ready for me to move into.  i pulled up carpet, painted walls, cleaned walls, cleaned and polished the hard wood floors.  pretty much, you name it, i did it.  now all i have to do is keep the grass mowed and dig up the pole in the back yard.  yes, i have a pole in my back yard and most of my guy friends are telling me to leave it, but unless they are willing to use it...i'm getting rid of it.  anyway, for those of you in the area...please come visit.  as far as life...its busy.  if you thought i worked a lot during the school year, i'm working more than ever now.  at least twice a week i work the gym from open till whenever, then go intern at warm hearth, then go work kroger.  between these jobs, i give myself 30min, which allows me just enough time to eat in the car and drive there.  however, as busy as i am, i am making an effort to hang out w/ everyone whenever i can.  especially michelle...shes leaving me in a few short days.  though i'll miss her....i will come visit you....okay.  and jody, i havent really thought about when i can go out to cali w/ you.  i'll try to work on that asap.  change of subject.  jody, i hope you win your competition.  it sounds like a lot of fun.  wish i was there to see it.  congrats on the upcoming wedding...even though its fake, i wish you all the best.

       So I had to write just because I can't stand that the boys have more recent blogs than us! I gave my presentation. Not a ton of fun but it got me out of two days work and I got to meet some interesting people. Tonight is the night of our lives in that it is the Miss Ag Econ White Trash Universe Pageant. We all had to get dresses from good will and I even got my hair cut so I could have big bangs! The best part is its being video taped and then whoever wins has to wear the sash and tierra the next day at the ag econ picnic. The competition is tough so I am going home to watch the best movie around... The Blue Collar Comedy Tour. Its AWESOME if you love some redneck jokes.   In other news I have started a class this summer and it sucks. I really like not doing anything! Talk to you girls Later!

       Sounds like everyone is having fun. I on the other hand have had to rewrite a paper about a dozen times and have to leave at 5am tommorrow morning to go to southern Indiana for two days. I get to hang out with a bunch of farmers which is going to be so much fun. In much better news I am getting married. Don't freak out! Its just a joke but I do have to say I think I would marry him if he was even half serious. Here he  urlLink is . About the greatest guy on earth. Too bad he went back to Kansas today :(. Well thats about all I know. Tiff we really do need to decide when we are going to Cali. So let me know what works for you!

       my lack of blogging has been due to several factors.  the main one is the fact that i have no home.  as most of you know, i have moved out of my apt and into josh's apt until my grandfathers house has been fixed up for me to move into.  you all would be proud of me b/c i have been working in that house every free moment i have pulling up carpet, cleaning and polishing floors, cleaning walls, and painting...just so i can have a place to call home asap.  plus, i was gone all of last week on vacation to my "happy place"....williamsburg/va beach.  i had a great time and just chilled w/ most everyone i know in the area.  i must say...michelle is following me b/c i ran into her at busch.  thanks to walter to helped me find out that one lap around the park is 1.67 miles.  of course, whats a trip to va beach w/out seeing chrissy.  one day chrissy, birdy and i all hung out like old times.  we did what we do best...eat, tell stories, and make fun of people.  our eating adventures have expanded to the point that we made a game out of it.  we went to a different resturant for each part of the meal.  thus, we would order one plate for all of us to share and even took turns paying for the different meals.  it was great....dad was impressed.  there was also chilling w/ elaine and hiking w/ rob.  and never again will i go back to a barnes and noble w/out warmer clothes on.  according to chrissy, elaine, and i, they keep to the store freezing cold so you will have to buy coffee.  all in all, it was a great trip.  good times, good times.

       Wow we are real slackers. I guess everyone has been busy. I know I have. I have written a few papers and traveled to Michigan. Not much going on except that I have found a new favorite bar. Its not quite HOHO's and doesn't have a pool table, but any place where you only have to buy one drink and the rest are bought for you and you get to dance on the bar is one cool place. Its called the Filling Station and the best bar tender in the world works there. Her name is Kay and she even invited us to her wedding on our second night there. Gotta love that. Well hope everyone is doing alright!

       the buzz around town is starting to become football.&nbsp; hokie fans are getting ready for te new fall 2004 season.&nbsp; everyone i've talked to believes that we will win about half our games this year.&nbsp; however, that's not stopping us from going to every game.&nbsp; also, there is talk of vick.&nbsp; the new news is that he's leaving vt...what a surprise...and going to southern georgia.&nbsp; since so. ga is a division 2 school, he is techniquely able to play there.&nbsp; i think he shouldnt be able to play anywhere, no matter what the division.&nbsp; to me, only restricted from playing at division I schools, but not anywhere else doesnt help punish the crime.&nbsp; what can i do.&nbsp; at least i know/hope he's leaving vt and will become someone elses problem.

       So I am back to attracting thirty something divorcees. I pretty much ignored the guy all night last night cus I was hanging with my girls and I wanted to spend some time with them. We went home early because we all had to be up and at 'em this morning . Then I get a phone call after being home like half an hour and its him. He told me I should call him tonight and let him know what I was going to be doing. I told him he could call me and I might tell him where I was. Its funny that he didn't want to hang out until I ignored him. Playing hard to get really works. The thing is its not hard to get when you don't want to get them! We'll see if he calls tonight. Please don't let me do anything stupid like kiss him!

       last night was no exception for the gang to get together & chill.&nbsp; as usual, we talked of cars & girls.&nbsp; this time we took our car talk to the computer.&nbsp; earlier in the day, the guys went out racing and got some video footage of it.&nbsp; then they got the idea of making a video of their races.&nbsp; then they decided they needed some "donut" footage to add, therefore, back out they went for more.&nbsp; i'm looking forward to seeing the final product. sometime in the scheme of things, jon kept stripping down to his boxer, so he could barge in on ken or hump the pudding.&nbsp; one of the funniest moment was when brian, me, jon, and emily were all sitting on the couch...in that order...so not to have man touching.&nbsp; all of a sudden, jon and brian strip down to their boaxer, while we are waiting for everyone else to come back into the room.&nbsp; to help express their package size, they both stuff their shirts down their pants.&nbsp; we are all giggling like girls and having a great time and yet no one wonders what we are doing.&nbsp; finally, joes phone rings and he comes out into the room trying to find his phone.&nbsp; we all point to the tv, where his phone is at and just sit there like its normal to have 2 naked guys sitting on a couch w/ 2 girls.&nbsp; joes at first pays us no attention...almost like its normal or wouldnt expect anything less from us.&nbsp; then once he realizes whats he's seen, he looks at us in shocked disbelief, walks outside, and answers his phone.&nbsp; after a few more minutes, ken and some girl come out, see us and start laughing.&nbsp; our plan worked.

       Wow I can't believe you two. All I have been doing is hanging out in West Lafayette Indiana working. I am going to get a break and go visit the fam at the new place in Oklahoma for about 10 days between classes. Of course my major professor just told me that I should have the first chapter of my thesis written before I leave! That's on top of doing homework, a group project, taking a final and re-editing a paper four the fourth time. But enough of my whining.&nbsp;There are two guys interning from France here and I got to hang out with them on Friday night.&nbsp;They were a&nbsp;lot of fun but its hard to be around them because their&nbsp;English isn't the best. I hope to spend more time with them before they leave but I don't know if its going to happen. Other than&nbsp;two French guys that smell a little too French for me nothing much is happening.&nbsp;Hopefully when the new students get here&nbsp;things will get a lot more interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Hello hello!!  Sounds like you have been having some adventures Ms. Tiff! Glad you are having a good time. Give me a ring on the cell when you get a chance. I know you are super busy but I'd love to hear from ya. Any new news about your husband to be Jody? Is he a cutie??  CA is still great. I am an apprentice with a modern company in L.A., taking classes with and from some of the most incredible dancers I have ever met, potencial teaching jobs are starting to pop up, my car has CA plates, and I am working at Hallmark... This makes me a very busy gal! We went to magic mountain (6 Flags) last week and rode some of the most amazing rollercoasters that I have ever experienced.... SO Tiff and Jody and anyone else who dares... come visit and you can scream as if it will save your life while falling head first and backwards hundreds of feet. There is nothing else like it! Totally awesome.  Tonight it is to the beach for a campfire. Time to roast the marshmellows!!!

       1030 am fri morning, i get a call from jon telling me everything is on schedule.&nbsp; 130 pm, fri afternoon, jon calls again saying he is still on time and will be leaving work w/in 30min to come pick me up.&nbsp; 207pm, jon arrives at my front door and we&nbsp;&nbsp;proceed to head to his house and wait for ken and brian to get there.&nbsp; during this time, i felt like i was in a james bond movie.&nbsp; anyway, we all pile in kens car ready to travel east toward va beach.&nbsp; just as we were approaching the tunnel on i-64, we get stuck in traffic.&nbsp; but we made the best of it by...1) brian mooning cars, 2) the guys hitting on girls in neighboring cars, and 3) jon entertaining us via song or jokes.&nbsp; finally, we get out of traffic and we reach our first destination...the va beach amp theater.&nbsp; dmb was playing and out ticket in was us being escorted in through the back gates by one of jon's best friends.&nbsp; that was really cool.&nbsp; well the concert itself was good.&nbsp; the only thing i didnt like was i thought there was too much jamming w/ each song b/c all his songs lasted 10-15 min.&nbsp; jamming is fine, i can handle it on occasion or w/ some of the songs, but not w/ everyone.&nbsp; but after a while, i just wanted to hear more of dave singing different songs.&nbsp; i think he played a total of 8 songs w/in&nbsp; 2.5-3 hours.&nbsp; none the less, it was a great time...i liked the atmosphere of being outside and surrounded by tons of people.&nbsp; day 2, sat morning, i wake up early at 815am.&nbsp; after showering, i proceed to head downstairs to enjoy a relaxing breakfast w/ jon's mom and dad.&nbsp; turns out, i got up too early b/c i was able to talk w/ jon's folks for 1.5 hours before jon woke up.&nbsp; the first thing out of jon's mouth was not good morning or how are you, but "what did i tell you, no raising the standards."&nbsp; all i could do was laugh.&nbsp; anyway, about every half hour after that someone else woke up.&nbsp; about 230pm we arrived at busch gardens.&nbsp; first stop...the loch ness monster.&nbsp; a classic roller coaster that will always be good.&nbsp; the weather was perfect.&nbsp; though it was overcast, it kept people away b/c of the chance of rain.&nbsp; plus, it was a good temp and not humid, which was a bonus, especially when you're going to be outside all day.&nbsp; after a few hours in the park, i called my sis.&nbsp; we met up and all road the the bumper cars together...andrew and i were a team taking on the world.&nbsp; as the evening came, more and more people left and the lines were even shorter than before.&nbsp; we were able to ride the alpangest 3 times in a row w/out having to wait.&nbsp; it was great.&nbsp; we had a great time and didnt leave the park until they announced it was closed.&nbsp; day 3, sun morning, i slept a little longer and managed to get 7 hours of sleep.&nbsp; i woke to the wonderful aroma of eggs, bacon, and toast.&nbsp; afterward, jon, his parents and i headed outside to get a look and listen of jon's dads harley.&nbsp; it was pretty.&nbsp; it had hokie colors w/ a maroon base and orange and white thin strips that ran around the border of each piece.&nbsp; once everyone had gotten ready for the day, we were on the road to face our next adventure, which involved the hot sun, waves, seafood, eye candy, and fun.&nbsp; being w/ 3 guys they naturally enjoyed the scenery of the young teenage girls in bikinis.&nbsp; with that, came their attempt of trying to hit on who ever they could.&nbsp; (hitting on girls took place the whole wkend starting in the car ride down until we got back home.&nbsp; in fact, it never stops w/ them.&nbsp; according to jon, if his mouth is open, he's hitting on you.)&nbsp; anyway, we all walked the beach and got our feet wet.&nbsp; afterward, we road the skyscraper, which is nothing more than a 165 ft pole w/ a basket on each end.&nbsp; at the touch of a botton, it spins you around, while the basket will also flip and turn you up side down.&nbsp; of course, in some instances, you are racing downward upside down w/ the thought that you are going to skim your head on the pavement.&nbsp; of course it never happens, but its neat to experience.&nbsp; also the view from the top was amazing.&nbsp; after the ride, it was time to eat seafood.&nbsp; mmm.&nbsp; it was good.&nbsp; our poor waitress tolerated the guys quiet nicely and possibly even enjoyed their attemps of trying to get her number.&nbsp; meter ran out and it was getting late, so homeward bound we were.&nbsp; ahh.&nbsp; theres no place like home.&nbsp; the adventure was over, but one i will never forget.&nbsp; just as i'm unpacking, i receive a call from joe.&nbsp; dinner at the cellar was the plan.&nbsp; next, he calls jon for me to tell him to come back and pick me up, so we can both travel to meet up w/ him and matt.&nbsp; just when i thought the wkend was over, it was only just beginning...for who knows what the rest of the wk will hold.

       last night was the last real night that alison was in town before she headed out to alaska for grad school.&nbsp; even though i had to open the gym this morning at 530am, i still went out.&nbsp; knowing i had to be up really early i debated even going to bed, or sleeping a few hours at home then head into work, or just go into work early to open up, then pass out in the back room.&nbsp; well, as the night progressed, the vote of me just sleeping a few hours at home won and thats exactly what i did.&nbsp; i got into bed at 230am and woke at 430am.&nbsp; i took a shower, folded some clothes and headed into work.&nbsp; 530am and the regulars that normally came at this time are not here, therefore, i knew i had until 6am before my next few regulars would show.&nbsp; thus, i layed my head down on the desk until they arrived.&nbsp; by 730am they are gone.&nbsp; now my mission was to find a place to nap.&nbsp; so i went to the back room, where they teach pilates, and&nbsp;layed down on the mats.&nbsp; after about 20-30 mins, i heard "beep"...someone had checked in.&nbsp; i got up and&nbsp;went back to my post at the desk b/c knowing my luck someone would walk in and catch me sleeping.&nbsp; now, mission II, where can i hide and sleep.&nbsp; well, the bathroom has showers w/ curtains up and benches.&nbsp; so, i went and sat on one of the benches, closed the curtain so no one could see&nbsp;me, and tried ot get comfortable.&nbsp; it was hopeless, i couldn't lay down or stretch...all i could do was just sit w/ my head resting on the wall.&nbsp; this would do for another 20min until i realized&nbsp;i've been gone too long and need to reappear.&nbsp; well,&nbsp;after writing this, i have woken up.&nbsp; but that will not keep me from going&nbsp;straight to bed&nbsp;and sleeping a few hours when i get home before heading into kroger.  as a side not, i had fun at the rivermill last night.&nbsp; i got to do everything that i liked...played a game of pool w/ joe (saddly we lost) and threw some darts against him.&nbsp; plus, i got to sit around, relax, and have a few drinks w/ my gang.&nbsp; i even watched some drama unfold, but i was good times for me at least. &nbsp;

       So more on the father and son farmers.... Today is the last day that I will ever see them, and dad took my picture! He of course asked but what can you say? No don't take my picture! Everyone that was there has been joking about how he has found his new daughter-in-law. I guess its good that I can laugh about it, but it was embarrassing as hell. He did take my friend Leatta's pic too so atleast i'm not the only one, but I am pretty sure he just did that to make me feel better. In other news... there is no news, but no&nbsp;news is good news so we will&nbsp;leave it at that. &nbsp;  Tiff its cool that you are on a new diet. I wish I had your will power to do that myself. However I love food and it loves me so I don't think it is going to happen.

       thank you jody for blogging.&nbsp; i was getting tired of reading my own thoughts.&nbsp; and michelle, its good to hear that you are loving cali.&nbsp; call me one day...its easier to get me on the phone than im these days. &nbsp; anyway, ive put myself on one of my diets.&nbsp; this one is based&nbsp;from a bodybuilders diet like they would use before competition.&nbsp; though i have no plans of ever doing a show, i am experimenting to see how easy or hard it is for me to lose the fat.&nbsp; plus, since i dont have anything to go by, just what little i've heard from other people, i want to see if what i'm doing will work.&nbsp; i will have to admit, that the diet is easy in the fact that i dont care if i eat the same foods over and over or eat things that are bland to taste.&nbsp; pretty much all i eat is chicken, tuna straight from the can, vegetables (but little to no corn or carrots), brown rice, potatoes, plan oatmeal w/ a little bit of peanut butter and splenda, some select fruits, and lots of water.&nbsp; the hard part is when i am out w/ friends.&nbsp; i really cant eat or drink the same things as them, so i have to plan ahead and eat before hand.&nbsp; plus, a few of them just dont understand why i would do this to myself.&nbsp; what can i say, i'm crazy when it comes to exercise and fitness.&nbsp; plus, i figure, if someone ever comes to me and wants advise on how to diet for a show, i want to be able to tell them first hand and not just something that i read out of a book.&nbsp; another hard part is after a few days, i've now become more hungry all the time.&nbsp; which isnt so bad because i eat every 3-4 hours...depending on how my work schedule permits.&nbsp;all in all, this diet is working in that i have lost some weight.&nbsp; i just really want to see if i can't get ripped or at least lose some of my body fat.&nbsp; when im done dieting, i'll still cont watching what i eat/drink, but i hope not to gain that much weight back...b/c i know some will return.&nbsp; but thats life.

       So I know I have kinda sucked at this whole blogging thing for a while but I have been busy, and by busy I mean lazy. Tiff, you always make me laugh. There is nothing like practice. I seem to be attracting thirty something divorcees right now. Maybe its the bars I hang out in but I try to practice and they get mad. It just isn't fair. If they know you are practicing then they don't act the same but if they don't know they get mad when you don't want anything from them.&nbsp;Right now I am working with farmers in a workshop and I offered to help two gentlemen (old enough to be my dad). This one&nbsp;started asking questions like "are you an only child?"&nbsp;and "how many acres does your family farm?"&nbsp;Well I didn't know what was going on until his son came back. The dad was scoping me out for his son. It was pretty funny, but I am helping them for the next three days and this makes it more interesting for me. Especially since one of the professors helping told me those were the questions to ask any cute&nbsp;farm boys&nbsp;that I met. I could use this for practice but it brings dad into it and thats not always good. Its just kind of nice to meet someone born in the same decade as me!  &nbsp;  My parents are moving in to the new house in Oklahoma today so I guess its official I am an Okie. I can't wait to make it down there but first I have to finish my stats class. I hate stats and it&nbsp;may come down to manipulating my teacher to get an A. I guess you do what you have to do. &nbsp;

       so i'm going to the chapel and i'm going to get married.....well, i didnt get married, but my cousin did this past weekend at the uva chapel.&nbsp; my plan for the weekend was to look hot and try to see if i could hook up&nbsp;&nbsp;w/ one of the single guys there.&nbsp; i figured that i had a good chance b/c my cousin is just a few years older than me w/ lots of his guy pals coming to the wedding.&nbsp; not to mention, he is a lawyer, so i was hoping to find a nice lawyer in the pack.&nbsp; during the wedding ceremony, i was unable to check out the crowd b/c i ended up&nbsp;being sat up front.&nbsp; however, i didnt mind...i knew that the reception was where all the interaction would take place anyway.&nbsp; as the night progressed, i wandered around talking w/ relatives and really just wandered.&nbsp; however, it didnt take long for one guy to stop me and start talking w/ me in the food line.&nbsp; now this guy was tall...probably about 6' 4".&nbsp; he had dark thick curly hair with dark brown eyes.&nbsp; he appeared to have the starts of belly, which probably started due to age and alcohol....but&nbsp;it didnt look bad.&nbsp; now, i was not at all interested in this guy, but that didnt stop me from talking w/ him b/c i enjoy meeting new people.&nbsp; plus, i figured i could use the practice.&nbsp; our converstation started out w/ the basics of name, major, where do you live, and who do you&nbsp; know here.&nbsp; to answer these questions,&nbsp; his name was mike, he will be graduating from uva in may as a cancer doctor, he lives in charlottesville, and he was my cousin's roommate for 2 years during college.&nbsp; though he wasnt a lawyer, a doctor was just as good.&nbsp; at least w/ his science background and what little science i had taken compared to him, we were able to have some common interest in things to chat about.&nbsp; the whole school talk didnt last long.&nbsp; once we were surrounded w/ other people, the conversation changed to the good ol days of parties, stupid things we had done, and how bad of singers we were at karaoke.&nbsp;it was good times.&nbsp;&nbsp;however, w/ all weddings, they do end and we parted saying good bye.&nbsp; no numbers were exchanged, but i really didnt want to give him mine and i really didnt want his.&nbsp; but maybe i should have...so the next time i go up there i can call him up and make him take me out on the town or get me tickets to a sporting event....you know...more practice....hehe.&nbsp;

       so i'm at the crc gym this morning doing my normal routine like talking w/ customers, sitting around, and washing towels.  on one of my trips from the chat room cafe to the gym, i stopped to read the headlines in the paper.  while skimming the paper, i was asked, "what should todays pizza be?"  my first thought was bbq, but decided against it b/c bbq was already another main course special.  my second thought was fajitas.  i even mentioned spinach, but there was none in stock.  thus, my chicken fajita pizza was it.

       even though i had to work today, i felt like i had the day off b/c i only had to work 5 hours at the gym this morning.  i got off at 1pm and almost didnt know what to do w/ myself.  i felt like i had all the time in the world to go and do things...b/c if you know my work schedule, i usually dont get off till 9pm.  anyway, w/ my free time i decided to take a jog on the huckleberry trail.  considering i went around 2pm, it wasnt that hot.  it was great.  plus, i got to enjoy the great outdoors. on my track back to the car, i noticed all the wild flowers on the side of the trail.  i was like, "those are actually quite pretty...they would look great in my living room."  then i debated w/ myself for about a half a mile whether i should stop and pick a few.  first, i was just going to leave the flowers in their natural habitat b/c thats where they belonged.  plus, i didnt want to carry them back to the car.  then i got to thinking that i really would like a few of them, but i had to convince myself it was ok and i wouldnt be breaking the law.  well, i figured that i am a tax paying montgomery county resident, the huckleberry trail was made for the residents (and others) for montgomery county.  therefore, i figured ive already paid for the flowers.  so, during the last 0.2 mile stretch, i stopped and picked a few flowers.  yep, i was right, they do look nice in my living room.  come see for yourself.

       marcus vick has once again gotten into trouble.  this time it happened to be reckless driving and maraijuana position.  if you recall, during the school year he was charged w/ position of alcohol and providing alcohol to minors...15 and 16 year old girls. and who knows what else he's done that the university has been able to cover up. anyway, according to law, these charges are only considered  misdemeanors, but come on people.  he CAN'T be taught.  how many charges is it going to take for vt to realize what he's doing to our university.  granted, he's making himself look bad and destroying his career, but he's also making the university look bad.  he's a football player and, yes, whatever he does, represnts our school.  though he maybe a great player on paper, but w/ loss of playing time due to his pentalities, he won't become an excellent player.  when your actions are being televised and put up on  urlLink espn.com , then that shows that people are watching and paying attention to every move you make.  now i know that other athletes have done the same things as vick, but they were smarter about it than him b/c they knew how not to get caught or be seen in the eyes of the public.  as of right now, i am not pleased w/ vick. i think that he should be kicked off the team. he CAN be replaced.  to me, its also like being in the military....w/ that statis, with that uniform you wear, you represent your country/school/organization and need to watch your actions b/c big brother is watching.

       michelle, i can't wait to see you.  however, i will be out of town the weekend you are coming in town.  BUT, i will be back sometime on aug 29th...so we'll have a few days to chill.  until then.  so i've been grandpa sitting this week.  i'm not susposed to leave him alone too long, which i've been able to do pretty good thus far.  most nights that i've been with him i came over to the house after work and stayed in or if i went out, i waited till 11ish before leaving.  for instance, i went out to karaoke on tues night.  but i waited to leave until he was in bed b/c he doesnt need anyone watching him sleep.   however, today will be a test.  i plan on going hiking and that means i'll be gone for about 5 hours.  that also means i might not be back in time to feed and water him.  to solve this problem, i've left several notes around the house for him.  i've also pre-prepared his dinner and left a note telling him to put in the microwave and press start.  well see what happens, but hopefully mom and dad will be back by then.    on a different topic.  i happened to run into one of my professors yesterday at steppin out.  i didnt think she really remembered me b/c i've only had her for one class, but i have gone and talked w/ her at her office a few times.  well, the next thing i knew....she comes up to me and starts talking.  she did remember me...i was surprised.  however, i think she was trying to get jon or i to babysit for her.  if we hadnt been rolling down the hill and then tried to race other kids down the hill, she probably would not have even spoken to us.  but yeah....rolling down hills is still fun no matter what age.  be advised, you may get a little bit dizzy.

       i'm sitting around at the crc waiting for time to pass. i happen to glance out the window and see this guy walking in to work.  he's carrying a gatorade and nerf football.  my conclusion is that he won't be working very hard today.

       Tiff I got the Pics! Thanks so much! Everyone loved them. Michelle you are on my calendar and I will be there if at all possible! I am getting sad. It is my last day with my office mate as she is moving up to where all the cool people are. I will have a new one when I come back from Oklahoma but its just not the same. I also have a final this afternoon and have done little to no preparation for it. I guess its good that its open note open book. I have written the first six pages of my thesis although I am supposed to have 12. Oh well I don't care. I just am excited that I am going home! Or not home but to a new home. Its going to be totally strange. But that is my life right now. Not much cool going on but things will really pick up when I get back.

       A little something I heard on the radio this morning  What does your handwriting mean???  If you loop the letter ‘c’ at the top = you are vain The lower you cross your ‘t’s = the less ambition you have If you curve your ‘w’ and ‘v’ = you are sensitive and poetic If your signature is different than your regular handwriting = you are putting on a show If your handwriting is angular = you need to relax If your letters are squatty (short/fat/rounded…like Disney) = you are childish

       so i'm at the wt club working and one of my favorite members comes in.  i was esctatic to see him b/c it has been forever since he's come in, while i've been there.  during the school year, he used to come everyday.  back then, we mostly just did the simple hello, how are you.  after a while it progressed to a few minute conversation.  but today, we actually got to catch up a little bit.  one thing i love about him is his accent.  it's like a british w/ an australian twist.  but really, i dont' know or care b/c it sounds wonderful...i could listen to him talk all day.  it wouldnt matter about what either, as long as he's saying something.
