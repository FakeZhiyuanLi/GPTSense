       Life.  There have been way too many perplexing moments from my childhood on that all have a common theme. Indifference. When I was three, my child-like spirit shined without knowing shame, guilt, doing wrong, paying for your "indifference" from the rest of the world.  My first memory of this would be when I was three years old, a smiley, bubbly me, asking my mother to explain to me why I was not black. Yes, I am white. My innocent eyes, seen the world as a different place, everyone the same, no indifference from the structure our society seeks on what to wear. Red carpet shows on who's who and........WHO ARE YOU WEARING? My very fiber that I am made of, can tell you the giggles, the shock, the "oh my god, pat..............she wants to be black!".........and the odd looks that came from everyone around me.  That has to be the first memorable milestone for me. Now, do not go believing that I was shamed........or shunned. Infact, my mother gave me my one request.......an   AFRO !  Aye capt', I said afro.   Personally, as I look back and type this, my soul can honestly speak and say the reason why I wanted to be black.  Every single black person I met, which honestly was alot at the time, were very nice to me. Talked to anyone, or so my eyes could see. Embraced people, and laughed heartily, dancing, joyous, and were not afraid to be themselves. A sense of family, a zest for life, and just being down to earth.......is what I saw.  Which, at that time, was exactly me.  Glancing back through that memory, reminded me of my father. Self taught percussionist at the age of 16, and that man can still jam and keep up with the likes of larry mullin jr, mel torme,  CARTER  from, DMB and more.  My father, which you will see later on in this BLOG of my flippin' life.............is a great man today, and one hell of a beast from the past for me. Thankfully I have my head on straight......no serious mental issues, just your occasional paxil popping moment. (joke) Dad was the man of the house, he was the love of the family and he also was the first one to show me, and EXPLAIN to me that just because you are different than the rest, means there is nothing wrong with you. Wonderful! So, why am I white and not black?   Life is in color, not black nor white, it has many unique layers of self destruction, self love, self discovery, and paving the way for milestones to happen...........which are building blocks to one's character, and future.  Embrace them.
