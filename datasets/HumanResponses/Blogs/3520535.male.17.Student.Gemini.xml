      Error!  The account megan has been suspended! Use your browser's back button if you wish to try again.    This is the message I recieved when I actually thought to go to the megan site. It seems that the site itself has gotten into trouble. I've still been recieving the IMs though, so it's completely automatic. I don't know if they're real screen names of just made up ones, nor do I know how they have my sn.  Here's a recent one:   Ss11whale:  Héy you havé to comé chéck thís awsomé wêbcäm síté out, íts so PIMP!        megan.homepage.nu            kdp

      I just found out that the .nu suffix is for the island nation of Nieu in the Pacific. I've heard of them, I heard that they grant corporation charters to all comers and grant complete anonymity. This is a safe-haven for criminals I'm dealing with here, I must be careful. I tread lightly....

      Here is my final revised and completed survey to be used at your discretion. I expanded and added to the original and left some questions alone that would not be entirely accurate because of the time in which they were answered that I left in place for various reasons, usually I thought they told some little thing about me you all should know. Give this to whomever you’d like and feel free to ask me any questions. I am and open book that has an open door and though this poses some serious structural problems I am emotionally content with the situation. Take care of yourselves because yes, I do care.  Basics  1. What time/date is it? 10:04 27 April  2. What is your name? Cory Alan Fitz 3. Nickname? Fitz, Fitzie baby, that guy back there who’s loosin’ it. 4. Gender? Male. I think. Yep, the testes are in place. 5. Age? 16 as of 12 June 2003 6. What is your fav. thing about your appearance? The color of my hair 7. Least fav. thing? It’s more my body in general than my appearance, like I wish I were shorter but it isn’t the look of my height. 8. Do you have a personal motto/quote? It happens….  Preferences  9. Starbursts or skittles? Skittles. 10. Hair color? Black. 11. Skin shade? Pale, as pale as possible (that is of course only if you’re white). 12. Peanut butter; creamy or crunchy? Only crunchy. 13.

If you could skip one class and not get in trouble which class would you choose? Oceanography - wait I do all the time already. Interested in…?  35. Sports? Nope - I don’t mind doing things and being active though I don’t do so often enough, but I hate communal activity and team efforts and the like. And I can’t stand working towards a goal that gives me nothing - like scoring a goal, winning the game. 36. Art? Nope. Maybe it looks pretty, ok, but I’m not often moved by art, nor do I have the talent for it. 37. Mythology? Not really, I do seem to be getting into Beowulf though. But that’s probably because of my interest in history and Anglo-Saxon. 38. Pop culture? No. Most of the things I like tend not to be that popular. But I never shy away from popular things for that reason alone. That seems a bad criteria. Or is it criterion? 39. Anime? Not at all. Just… no. Maybe later in my life. 40. Computers? Yes. I’m getting my A+ Certification some time next year so I hope to understand them even better. I suck at programming - I never apply myself. 41. Calligraphy? No. I can’t even write cursive. 42.

No. I don’t really like working with living things. 45. Interior design? No. I want things to look nice but I’m not going to study ways of making it so. 46. Electronics? Not so much. I get easily bored with electronics. I could do it but it bothers me. 47. Sexy ladies? Of course. Though my standards seem to be grossly different from most people. Worst aesthetically - a white woman who has decided to get a really dark tan, and has blonde hair, goldish blonde. Music  48. What do you like to listen to? Good music (this does not include rap or country) 49. Fav. Radio station? 96.1 50. Play any musical instruments? No 51. Any that you’d like to play? Not right now.

None that I can think of. Books  58. What was the worst book you were forced to read for school? The Color Purple 59. The best? The Catcher in the Rye. Maybe Beowulf if we do it next year. 60. If you had to read a biography, whose would you read? John Dillinger - kick ass bank robber. 61. How often do you read? Used to more often.

What is your fav. series? Dune 66. If you could be any character, whom would you be and why? Jason Bourne - he doesn’t know who he is and that person is really cool. He has to understand what exactly his past is and realizes that it becomes painful to hear. He falls in love amidst much death, international intrigue, and mystery, and his whole story has a sense of historical irony to it. I love that sort of thing. 67. If you could change the ending of any story, what story would you choose? The illuminatus! Trilogy would make more sense. Currently none of it does. 68. How would you change it? I said so already. 69. Which is better; the book or the movie? Depends on the book and movie. Books based on movies always suck though. Do you…  70. Carry a purse to school? No. 71. Like dark chocolate? Yes. 72. White chocolate? Yes. 73. Think this reveals something about your subconscious feelings concerning race? No. 74. Participate in after school activities? Not often. Spanish club usually. I plan to do a lot next year. Maybe Model UN, French and Spanish clubs. 75. Have any pets? A cat. It’s more my sisters than mine. Actually we have two. I have no personal obligations to either. I used to have an iguana. 76. Bad habits? I over-analyze everything. This leads to people disliking conversations with me. However I tend not to like those people anyway. It’s an automatic filter for my kind of people. 77. Siblings? 1.5. I have a younger sister (four years my junior) and an older half sister (four years my senior) who is from my father’s previous marriage. She only lived with us for a couple of years before she ran away in her senior year of college. For those of you with yearbooks of my ninth grade year can find her as a senior (Jessica Fitz). 78. Wear glasses? Yes. 79. How about flip-flops? Hate them. And so my feet are ridiculously pale. 80. Like to dance? Nope. 81. Like goldfish? Not really. I don’t like an animal I can’t pet. 82. Enjoy playing w/ hot wax? No. Have you ever…  83. Loved someone so bad it made you cry? No, wanted to.

Put something metal in the microwave? Yes, my mother corrected me. 86. Been in a band? No. 87. Stolen something? He he…. Yeah. I used to often.

Hard to be when I haven’t. 96. Been skinny-dipping? No. I don’t like being naked. 97. Cheated on someone? No. I’d end the relationship before I’d cheat on someone.

Wished you could travel back in time? Yes. 100. Seen Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure? Yes. It was great. 101. What time would you travel to? The eighties, east Europe, fall of communism, I love the feeling of optimism. Capitalism as an ideology could almost be respectable. 102. Been suspended from school? No, frequent detentions for tardiness though. 103. Bitten someone? Been bitten. Not by a girl though, which is the way I’d rather have it. Actually Zach bit me once and I almost bled.

Melissa - sister Beliefs  126. What are your political beliefs? Libertarian 127. Religious beliefs? It’s complex. I’m considering becoming more involved in my church and actually going again.

No. 137. Fate? No, but I thoroughly enjoy historic irony. 138. Witches: another name for Satanists? or just nice pagan people? The latter  Friends  139. Who listens to all your opinions/complaints?

Probably Zach. 141. Funniest? Zach, when we get in some conversation that only the two of us would understand. 142. Smartest? I honestly don’t know.

      I can’t wait to see you once again. All the time I’ve spent away, I’ve thought about none but you, my dear. I’ve almost returned to you, and when we once again meet, I’ll give to you the gift I promised. Take care, sweet darling.  -Your kindest one  	“You know I’ll always wait, dear,” she said as she closed the screen holding her only link with her world, her love. 	Justine had found the email light blinking on her desktop. She had opened the letter and read it, smiling, remembering her husband on his way back home from the Canaries. He was always old-fashioned and refused to take the usual trans-Atlantic flight, opting instead for a passenger ship. She prepared for her evening walk. 	Never one to shrink from the cold of night, she nevertheless found the familiar chirping of the night insects frightful, the usual ominous shadows oddly repulsive, her own breathing more shallow than could be comforting, and so decided against the stroll. Unfurling the scarf from around her neck and placing it alongside her jacket on the coat-rack, she thought instead that she would comfort herself by the warmth of the fireplace with the poem Beowulf in old English she had been reading lately, rationalizing that she needed practice on her Anglo-Saxon anyway. 	There was a feeling of unease as Justine read, a feeling that she had not been able to shake for the last three days. That was when her husband had begun sending her his electronic love messages that so comforted her yet left her strangely confused. For though she enjoyed knowing that he missed her still, signed himself her kindest one, and longed to be there, there seemed something otherworldly about the messages themselves. The idea was something that Brian would do, but not the words themselves. Nothing of course that she could pinpoint, no startling displays of wildly differing syntax, but something subtle. She had told herself, matter-of-factly, that the differences were in her mind, something easily imagined in the house so full of her memories of him, the spacious, old Victorian house they had found isolated from the rest of civilization, exactly how they liked it to be. 	Sleep found her, laying in the gaze of the fire, curled around a poem of long forgotten, heroic deeds. 	The gradual creeping of the sunlight across her face gently awoke the lonely wife, and she was surprised to find herself out of her bed. Rising, she replaced her book and quickly prepared for a shower. As she washed herself, she thought of all the things she wanted to accomplish. There was a used book store that had been recently opened in town and she planned on stopping by when she went in for grocery shopping. Since she had the time, she decided that both should coincide today.  	The car’s headlights shone through the misty air as they bounced slowly up the driveway to Justine’s home. She certainly had not planned on spending that much time out, but did not regret a moment of it. 	An armful each of bags, she deftly unlocked and opened her front door, a feat only possible after years of steady practice. “God awfully dusty in here,” she murmured, not wanting too long to go before a voice was heard in that house, that house seemingly unending in its growing ever distant from the reality of the town she loved, and her life that she remembered. 	She placed the groceries, books, and other assorted items on the dining room table. She found the light switches, lit her house so that it shone its warmth and light throughout the rooms she called home. The day had been tiring. She looked forward to a relaxing bath before bed, and made her way through the twisting corridors to her bedroom to undress. 	Brian had never been quite happy with their bedroom. He complained that it was far too large, with enough empty space to make it a dining room. But she insisted that it was perfect and he relented, as always. There was an armchair to the left of the bed. Numerous lamps dotted the room, allowing for light wherever one may wish to shine it. The thought of this did not escape Justine as she fumbled about in the dark, trying the main light, then a nightstand table lamp, then a free standing lamp by the bureau, lighting none. 	Panic set in, the kind that no one truly experiences until a situation arises where one knows that there is absolutely no way that a predicament can be pure accident, that some outside force has tampered with the way things should be, a primal fear that things are not right at all and that danger is imminent. 	Her frozen form was instantly illuminated from any figure that might be on the opposite side of the room at the clicking on of the brightest lamp by the desk which sat before aforesaid armchair. And, indeed there was a figure there, as evidenced by the sharp outline of a man in the armchair, behind which was the lamp. 	Justine’s panic became cautious relief when she saw by the light filling the room that there were rose petals covering the bed. Just the sort of over-the-top romantic thing that Brian would do. But as she opened her mouth to speak, another voice, not her husband’s silenced any thoughts of peace she would ever again experience in her tormented mind.  	Before the words themselves registered, the voice, the memories it evoked, came charging back into her consciousness with a ferocity that left her numb. The memories - the love, the loss, the long frightful nights never feeling safe, so much that she had spent six years forgetting, all of it at once accessible to her every whim. It pained her to know, and she knew that she would never be safe again, it had all been illusory. 	And then she began hearing what he said, “Good evening, my sweet Justine. You didn’t forget me did you? You wouldn’t forget me. You wouldn’t dare. I’m so glad that you’ve been preparing for my eventual return, making this house for us. It’s sweet, and I’d not expected it.” 	“This isn’t your house, you filth. Nothing of mine is yours. We settled this long ago. Why are you here? Why don’t you leave?” her shaking voice responded, unable to keep out the absolute fear. 	“Oh, and I told you the last time I saw you that I would be your only. I meant that. I said that anyone who got in between us would have to answer to me. And that I would allow you the satisfaction of knowing his fate. I made that promise and tonight, I deliver. Here is your gift, Justine, from me. I also told you never to forget, I am your kindest one.” 	He reached back to find another light switch, this one apparently in working order, and cast an eerie glow on the entire scene. The body of Justine’s late husband lay spread across the rose petal covered bed, his head in the lap of the man in the armchair.

      I can feel parts of my life slipping away. When it happens, it's hard to fight. Depression sets in, and the desire to lay dormant, let life do its worst. But I can't allow that, I have too much I need to do. My last day of summer school is tomorrow. I think if I do particularly well on this project I'm about to do, I can pull it from a C to a B provided I don't do too poorly on the exam. Who knows. And I seriously think I may have put myself in the doghouse with Chelsea. I've never seen her so pissed. She was quite upset when I didn't show up at summer school this morning, and was afraid that I'd fail. She bit through two weeks of nail growth that she was very proud of. After class she beat me, yelled at me, then gave me the silent treatment on the way to her house. And yet, I didn't even do it on purpose. I'd overslept and awoke when she called. At least someone cares. And Tiffany, Sarah's wife, isn't responding to my IMs, and I need to get my project out of the way so I can sleep. It's hard to muster the strength, and go to work tomorrow. At least part of this nonsense is almost done.

      I got a "haircut" today. After the hair dried I realized just how little they removed, but it's ok. I was only placating Chelsea. But I'd forgotten how much I liked being worked on by the hair stylist. It reminded me of the previous night. I love to have my hair played with. It's so soothing. I loose track of myself in an almost ecstasy of enjoyment, eyes rolling in the back of your head pleasure, and at those moments I wish I could purr. Afterwards I felt like I'd visited a prostitute, but I reminded myself that she also cut my hair. I'm serious - if you want me to do anything, just run your fingers through my hair, and I'm yours.

      In a sunrise of burning stop signs, Tomorrow's rising like a ghost from the graveyard of wishes. It's spirit bursting through prison fences, Flooding the street with a sea of sea of ski masks marching from our ditches. A new morning as bright as the smallest spark in the darkest dark. Warm as young lovers in mid kiss, It's wishes whisper between lovers' lips.  When I close my eyes I can see the ghost unearth her life, On never nights like tonight, When daybreak defies midnight. With the backing of the shovels' beat, Burning flags at her feet, crackling over the young lovers' lead, She screams: "Lovers of the world unite, there's no tomorrow...only tonight"  It's time for the new day to break, From the dead dreams we awake. Like a mute speaking, seizing his say, Tomorrow come today

      I've been listening to this sad, sweet song by Ben Folds, and it saddens me. So many people are gone. Signed offline. Robert and Michelle were speaking mostly to themselves and then they both left. And I don't want to sleep but have nothing else to do. Can't get ahold of Zach. I'd like to speak to Sarah. I heard she tried to reach me. So many fucked up things are happening to my family. I'll be at more than one funeral before it's over.  I love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you  Next door there's an old man who lived to his nineties And one day passed away in his sleep And his wife; she stayed for a couple of days And passed away  I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way to tell you that I know we belong That I know  That I am I am I am The luckiest

      Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac A little voice inside my head said don't look back You can never look back I thought I knew what love was What did I know? Those days are gone forever I should just let them go but I can see you Your brown skin shining in the sun You got that top pulled down and that Radio on baby And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong After the boys of summer have gone

      So, Cory, how are you liking the Blue Fin? -Well, it's ok. But could be better. So when do you work there again? -I work every day but monday and tuesday. That much? -Well I mostly work lunches so that's only maybe four hours. Oh I see. So, how many cooks do they have working there? -Well, one full time, and one part time.

      The dark street beckons, and in the humid air the lightning bugs dance. They flash in a huge orgy of light, their frantic mating signals becoming a picture of life unequaled by human frailties and desires. Why can't we come closer to this perfection?

      Well, today was okay. First day of summer school. Chelsea was in my class but then Mr. Mathews came and took her. But she said that tomorrow she'd steal me and put me in her class and he said okay. Then, took her home and stayed for about three hours. She attempted to braid my hair and then we played video games on Rebekah's gamecube. Forgot the book which I'd come for, but I'll get it tomorrow. Then, came home and had to take my sister out to eat since no one else is home. And that's about it. Also, I tend to get these instant messages from porn sites trying to get me to buy their services. And they're always a megan, have megan in their name, or be somehow meganish. Fucking megans. Oh well. I'll post more later.

      I remember another thing to add to my list of bizarre and wonderful memories. I kick in my parents bathroom door. I walk in with a rifle above my head and shout, "The rebels have taken the capitol city!" Noah is sitting on the toilet. He screams, "Ahhh! I'm naked!" True to his word, he isn't wearing anything, and doubles over to avoid exposing himself. I say, "Well, here's your toilet paper," and I toss it to him and leave.

      I've been watching American Pie, and I realized that if I were a character in that movie I'd be Finch. I mean, think about it. Paul Finch - Cory Fitz. Similar last names that people call us by. Intelligent and aloof, eccentric and living in a self-imposed exile from the world. He's a latin geek, and I just love language in general though I detest the romance languages offered at our school. we have different tastes but it's our differences that unite us. However I'd never sleep with Stiffler's mom. I much prefer Michelle. Nadia's too tan, but you gotta love the Czech girls. And another interesting thing, I've recently gotten into the Greatful Dead and I found out that Leigh Anne likes them as well. Though she disapproves of my  choice of Eighties new wave. My father is pleased that I am re-discovering his favorite band, so that's good. We never really talk.

      Well, I made up for the Sarah thing by taking her to the ice cream place after school and giving her a ride home afterwards. Wouldn't do to just leave her there. And as we spoke of her relationship with Noah, I wished that I could give her some sort of advice. She is such a sweet girl, and Noah just isn't really right for her. I think she sees that on some level but he doesn't. I have no idea why they're still together. Oh well. I'd write more but I must clean my room and write a biography on Ezra Pound. I do need some sleep.

      Got an Eighties cd today. It's great. I bought it at Wal-Mart, when I saw Emily Waters for probably the last time. And she wasn't mean to me. We had an actual cordial conversation. It was like closure since she's going off to college next year. We parted just like we were, acquaintances. Though I think we could have been and I would have liked to have been friends, I feel better, and have a better memory of her. She was an interesting person. Anyway, I'm also a bit worried for Chelsea because she was a upset on the phone, and as usual didn't want to talk to me about it. Which she never is. It's like being locked right outside her and denied access, the unfortunate thing being that I'm not sure I'll gain it. As I am a more open person, I'll just need to accept that our two definitions of friendship aren't quite the same. But the sad part is it's her birthday. She shouldn't be sad. Dammit. I can't deny that it also evokes a bizarre amount of envy. I open myself up to whomever will listen, and she keeps many secrets hidden and won't reveal them under any circumstances. It makes me feel superficial sometimes. Another bad part of the day is when I gave Paige a ride over Sarah Fore, I had promised Paige a ride after school but then she asked for it sooner right after lunch when Sarah asked for one, and then I said maybe I could take both and Sarah said she'd just ride the bus. Paige did have a very good reason for going home when she realised that she needed to return home to get something, but Sarah is moving soon and I feel I've let her down. Lord knows she has enough problems. I'll miss her. I have four more exams, I feel really good about the sociology one I took today and the spanish one I took earlier, I got a 100 on the english exam for my great SOLs, I just need to finish stuff for english and sociology and do my oceanography review. Oh well. Until later.

      All of the possible good things about this weekend have all fallen apart. Okay, there was going to be a party at the Every's house, but Michelle fell ill and so that's been postponed. Now here's the kicker, Robert said he'd like to do something over the weekend, since he wouldn't be able to spend much time with Michelle, but now she's good enough for him to no longer want to leave his house spending time with her and sitting at home watching porn and eating pizza. So, she's better just in time for my chance at lifting the boredom of the weekend to go byebye, but too late for the pool party. Reason two this weekend is shit: I'm working all goddam weekend, not a huge amount of hours but enough to ruin my chance of going to some protest with Noah tomorrow. And Zach's most likely gooing to get laid by some girl he doesn't even know that well tomorrow, and I have a fucking english assignment. The video I've borrowed from Mr. Eccleston for the english project was dropped by two people today (chelsea and james l.) and now has dented corners. A girl I was getting to know today gave me her phone number in my yearbook, but chelsea took off with that. Dammit. Shit, Piss and Mother Fucking Corruption! So, looking forward to a late project, a couple of exam reviews, and lots of work. Nice, isn't it? And all right before the last week of school. After which I get summerschool. Motherfuck.

      Scotty Doesn't Know is a great song written by the band Lustra (lustramusic.com) for the movie Eurotrip. It's a great song and I'll always remember it as the song I was listening to as a large truck drove directly into the side of my car. If I ever have a cheating girlfriend I hope I learn of it over a song written by the guy who's been banging her. Also, in the movie, Matt Damon plays the singer, though he's obviously not singing. I'm not sure exactly why he's even in the movie at all. Oh well. See the damn movie. It was one of the funniest things I've seen in a long while.

      Posting again today. In a bit of a more nostalgic mood. I've been thinking back to all of my best memories. Times that stand on their own, without needing to be propped up by a backstory, or context. Having a drink on top of a restaraunt in Key West, leaning against the railing watching the sun set, maroon radiance casting a glow upon the street performers below. Running through the streets of Cordoba at night, not really knowing what I'm looking for, and hoping that I never find it. The breeze from a fort in St. Augustine, wondering what the nation was like when people actually used this building as a fort, before the English had established so much as a single city on ancient soil. Driving at god-knows how fast down a deserted back road at night knowing that if I had hit anything I'd likely die. The sky-flyer at Kings Dominion with my older sister. When I'm a broken old man, these memories may well be all that's left of a life, people missed, and chances squandered.

      Stayed home from school today. Felt like shit. I wanted to see Chelsea and Leigh Anne though, Leigh Anne had something for me too, and so did Robert. Dammit. I always stay home on the worst possible days. Anyway, I need to shower I'm considering calling Zach's cellphone and seeing if he'd like to meet somewhere for lunch after school since he has an early out. My dreams last night were bizarre, including a shopping trip for sweaters, jogging through Yorktown, training a little kid to be a killer, and Myanmar invading and conquering Korea. All of Korea. Whatever. It's like and epic. You'd have to be there. Recently I've been trying to think of and list all of the really wierd moments in my life that never really made sense. This is what I have so far: - My half sister chasing me through my house with a used condom filled with Walter's semen. - Being locked in El Corte Ingles in Madrid and finally finding an exit not realizing that it was the employee exit and then being accosted by a security man thinking I was stealing something. Too bad I don't speak spanish. - Declining to go to a party because I know there's going to be a man there who has good reason to kill me since I helped to put him in jail for six months. - Being found in a bathroom waving to myself for half an hour stoned out of my mind on shrooms. - Screaming at Leigh Anne that same night to stop shrinking.  I know there are plenty more that I can't think of at the moment so I will add to the list later.

      Listening to music. AFI. Talking to Robert. Not quite bored. I need something though. Restless. I'm sore. Muscles hurt. I've been out of it physically today. Skipped my first three classes because I had a project due in english. Found out I did well on the SOLs though - a 600 on the reading at least. Then Zach didn't wait for me after school. At least I got to talk to Chelsea tonight - I'm glad that the band is back from NY. I am of course a bit jealous, but I did go to Spain when most were still in the US. Except Noah. He's gotten to go to both. (One day I'll have to write about the use of gotten as a past participle.) I want to go walking. If I go too far though I'll probably get the fucking dogs barking at me again. Oh well. I can leave this place in a year. And that's something I've grown to concern myself with more and more. I need to focus on my schoolwork. I don't really have a life - I'm not doing anything else really, I'm just so damn lazy. But Mrs. Ressler's right - anyone who has a 730 SAT verbal score has no reason for failing English. So, I grow to doubt myself. I don't know that I'll be able to accomplish what I want for my life. My friends will surpass me and move on and I'll be left alone. I bit melodramatic, I know, but possible nonetheless. Dammit. I can't allow that to happen. There will be time for everything I want later. Maturity is overriding one's short term desires for greater benefit. Can I do that? Is it feasable at this point? I'm sure it is if I bust my ass on pointless shit. In any event, I can always take my A+ Certification after next year, move to Australia, hope they accept it there, and repair computers for the rest of my life.

      This is my final post. I'm doing this in contrast to Robert's First entry because I want to avoid the dificulties he pointed out in the concept of the first entry. Therefore, I shall start with my last and work my way back to the beginning. We shall see how far that gets.

      I wish that I could understand the kind of carelessness that what Noah did to Sarah requires. To tell someone that you love them, that you want to share your life with this one person, and to not so much as mean it, is beyond my comprehension. To claim that three months should never have happened, that they were meaningless... How it hurts. Leaves people broken. If only he had been more careful with a young girl's heart.

      For those of you who care and could find this information useful, this is my work schedule that is pretty much permenant for the rest of this summer.  Monday - Off Tuesday - Off Wednesday - 12-4 Thursday - 5-Closing Friday - 5-Closing Saturday - Off Sunday - 10-4  Now these hours are for the Blue Fin; I have told Gary at Olivias I can work there on Wednesday and Saturday nights, so he'll probably have me working all of those nights. So Mondays and Tuesdays are the only days I definitally have off since the Blue Fin is closed those days. Closing time sepends of when I finish and could be any time after ten or as early as nine if I'm realy lucky but is usually about ten thirty.

      She asks. I don’t know what kind of an answer I can give. She wants me to stop doing those things, things that hurt me. I know that I do hate myself. As much as I love her. She says that I’m a wonderful person, that I’m sweet and delicate and kind, can I believe her? I know she means it. Is my soul a beautiful thing? I don’t know. I do want to help people. But I am selfish. Right now, I would do anything to be loved. This isn’t something transient, a rebounding cry for help. I’ve always wanted that. So many people out there, who can live life so easily, and not get too attached… that’s why I am sad. Because I’m not like they are, I won’t find one who can love as easily as me. People do prefer things that are shallow, and when they want more, it’s hard to really know that is what you want. So, assuming I am a good person, I am good as she says I am, why am I as alone as this? A beautiful soul in an ugly body, or bad luck and simple teenage despair? I'll be the pessimist and lean towards the first one. You be the judge.

      Oh my God. I found a frog in my parents' bathroom. I picked it up, and placed it outside. As I closed the door, it jumped back inside. I closed the door on it. It's paralyzed and its hind legs are dragging behind it. I should kill it and put it out of its misery, but I can't bring myself to do it. I moved it outside and maybe now I can forget about it. Oh my God.

      Hung in your room, swaying, hoping only that you'll see. All by myself, I'm alone in such poor company. The deeper I think, the deeper I seem to sink, I can't stop the insects that are feeding, pull the needles from beneath my skin. I broke myself, shattered, tied a bow around every peice. You'll love the eyes. Have they always shown so vacantly? The more I show the less you'll want to know. I can't stop the insects that are feeding, pull the needles from beneath my skin. Now I'm on display. I am becoming. Hurt myself today. It's all for you. Do you like what I'm becoming? Cut myself today. It's all for you. I part the night, flashing, approaching as I watch you flee. Pushed through your panes. Seems I've landed quite uncomfortably. But as I pass through souls of broken glass I can't stop the insects that are feeding. Pull the needles from beneath my skin.

      There&nbsp;is only one&nbsp;feeling that can combine academic speculation with deep emotion.&nbsp;It is&nbsp;nationalism. Nationalism itself is a kind of love. Love of the group. But there is also the idea of the nation. This comprises language, people, land, flora and fauna, as well as more adademic subects such as national ideals and types of governance. I have been reading a book called The Basque History of the World, and I've been thinking about what constitutes a nation, who are a people. In the end, there is no easy way to say that on this side of a border there are these people, and this side has these others. That's why nations such as the Basque Country are important to look to. They show us the difference between the concept of a nation, and its government.

      Ever since the beginning of high school, I haven't made that many male friends. In fact, I can think of only one: Robert. I retained two: Zach and Noah, and lost a few. But I've gained several female friends. I can't think of any I had before, but I gained Chelsea, Sonia, Rebekah, Michelle, Leigh Anne, Emily, Sarah... (if I didn't mention you - FEEL BAD! because you're obviously not talking to me enough. Stop neglecting me). Realizing this I've also come to realize that I'm more comfortable around girls than guys. And, honestly, I don't have an over-anaylzation for that. We'll just take it at face value. Anyway, I have lost the trust of Leigh Anne for what I told Chelsea. She already knew that I told Robert and then Chelsea managed to get it out of me, and Leigh Anne was obviously the last person Chelsea was supposed to tell, though I told her not to tell anyone. So she told Leigh Anne, destroying any trust she had in me. And this is not the first time. When Zach was about to break up with Kim, he told me, I told Chelsea, and Chelsea told Kim. There were extenuating circumstances, granted, but she was very careless. Now, I don't just go telling anyone anything. The point was, or was supposed to be, that Chesea was my confidant, someone I can trust anything with, and she repeatedly tells other people. In the instance with Zach, we had agreed to keep open a line of communication where we told each other things about Zach and Kim, and neither would know anything. When I finally get any information, it goes from Zach to me to Chelsea, and then immidiately to Kim. The opposite of the intended purpose. In fact it happened before, when Zach told me details of something less important, I relayed that to Chelsea assuming that she would do the same in keeping with the agreement, and yet she immidiately told Kim. So, while I repeatedly broke trust by telling Chelsea, no harm would have ever come had she not broken my trust by telling other people. People I doubt she holds in as high esteem as I hold her. So, at the moment, I am without confidant (except for Sarah, and she leaves the 29th), and I think I'll stay that way for a while. I want to simply build up my friends' trust. They should, and deserve to, trust me. They deserve much better. Trust is something very important to me, and I've abused this sort of thing far too often.

      Well, after pouring my heart out into a  really  long self-theraputic email to Sarah, I feel sort of drained, but I promised&nbsp;myself I'd write these things. Since I've been talking about it at some length today, and so that I may clear up any misconceptions or misunderstandings, consider this a final statement of my beliefs on this matter.&nbsp;As you may, or perhaps may not, know, I consider myself bisexual. Now, what does this mean to me? I want to establish exactly what I mean by my bisexuality in specific&nbsp;and what my feelings are on sexual orientation in general. Starting in general, I think that everyone is bisexual to some degree, and that humanity is more open than our social mores allow. Now, stay with me here while I use a bizarre analogy. I don't like when people say that sexual preference is determined before one is born, like their entire life is pre-planned before they take their first breath. And I equally hate it when they say that preference is determined by upbringing, like I'm a puppet of my parents and movies and schooling. All of this is incredible oversimplification. Imagine this: that people said that vegetarians were determined by genetics when they were born, and that the heads of the beef and poultry industries said that instead it was determined by upbringing and they could be changed. So they embark on a mission of returning the vegetarians to their natural carnivorous state, but the "liberals" insist that the vegetarians are born so, and that trying to change them is wrong. Do you see the ridiculousness? Do you? It's insane. Someone's sexual preference isn't hidden in a gene, nor is it entirely the result of teaching. It's something that is so completely a part of them that it's almost impossible to break down into it's constituent peices. It's as stupid as saying you can know what causes vegetarianism, or what causes people to prefer Pepsi over Coke, or why someone likes roller coasters or not, prefers to drive a stick shift or automatic. With that out of the way, I think that most people are more open to trying new things than they'd like to admit. I have little patience with these strict labels or gay, bi, and straight, as though we must do some soul searching, and then  this  is what we are, this is our label, stick to it, it won't let you down. It's more complex than that. And I can't say when I realized when I was bi. It was a long, gradual process where I came to put a label on myself, on my feelings, emotions, and attractions. When I was young, I realized that there were gay people, and then I asked myself, do I like girls? Yes, I do. Question settled. Or it was. Then, I would think about guys. Not really any particular guys, but about general attraction to masculinity as well as femininity. And for a while I just said I was curious. That I was straight but had an active imagination. And after a while, it dawned on me that there was little difference in what I was thinking and feeling and genuine bisexuality. This was about the beginning of tenth grade, and at this point I'd not had any emotional attraction towards anyone of the same sex as me. For the sake of my male friends, no I don't have a crush on you, my only male crush was early this year, I don't really know him that well, and he doesn't read this journal, though I wouldn't care if he did. I no longer hide these things. One more thing on this topic: there was no coming out of any damn closet. I was flung from it kicking and screaming. I told a girl named Amanda whom I thought I loved, who then after she let me down, she somehow communicated this to her new boyfiend Daniel. Now, I don't know the details of this, but somehow it came out, and though I doubt it, she might not be 100% to blame. However, Daniel is. He proceeded to tell everyone in ROTC about it because he thought it was fuckin' hilarious. Ass. So then for a while people would come up to me and ask in the hallway, and I'd just blow them off because it was none of their business. I would tell them if I knew them better, but they were just curious passers by. So shallow.

      Well, I saw King Arthur today, I liked it. It wasn't wonderful great, but it was good. The immobile armrest in the theater wasn't too good... But, as Sarah if fond of saying, we work with what we have. There was some awkwardness all around, but I'm glad I got to see her again. I miss her so. We need so much more time... I can't think of what I can't change. But why can't I feel better after seeing her? Why do I have to feel torn every time? And yet I'd sooner kill myself than stop seeing her. I so want to be on amiable terms with her family. That is complicated by her disinclination to have me really meet them, and her parents displeasure over her tardiness today. But I think things can be mended. There isn't much more time. She leaves first week of August, so that's just a couple more I guess. I want to make her happy. I have to make her happy. Otherwize... what's the point? Why have this abortive relationship? When we know it has to end. That it can't continue. Will it have been worth it? Only if I leave her a better person than I find her. If I can show her, and myself, that optimism isn't a flawed philosophy. Oh, God knows, I try.

      "I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say, 'This is the way it's got to be.'"  -George Bush: Debate with Al Gore in 2000  "I'm worried about an opponent who uses nation building and the military in the same sentence." -George Bush: Chattanooga, Tenn. 6 November 2000  You see, there is a nation to build. A nation that was brought to it's knees in order that they may be considered free. Now that their infrastructure has been broken, their country torn by conflict, a growing insurgency, and a large segment of the population thrown out of work by the US' decision to disband the Iraqi Army (thank you Mr. Bremer) the citizenry of the Republic of Iraq can now fully taste the freedom that they lacked when their electricity worked, when their husbands in the army had a pension to look forward to.  Tell me, because I'm interested in knowing, what freedom of religion do a people have who lack everyday necessities for life?  The reason why invading Iraq was a BAD idea was that no one has won. Our military should be used, as Bush has said and not believed, to fight and win wars, not to nation build. Not to police the world, but to protect the safety of a sovereign nation (that would be ours, not that of Iraq or any other). I feel much safer having thousands of Iraqis considering my country to be a nation of conquerors.  Our intelligence community has had it's reputation badly tarnished, see the recent congressional investigation. More people hate us. Our military force is so badly stretched that we are considering keeping soldiers in combat whose tours are already up. This distracts us from our debacles in Afghanistan where we still have accomplished little and need more manpower. Our international credibility is increasingly fragile where it isn't shattered beyond repair (See: NO WMD! and invading a country against the wishes of the UN for violating UN sanctions - (but not really doing that it turns out))  So yes, Rebekah, I have heard of sacrifice. People sacrifice all of the time. But sacrifice isn't what's going on now. Sacrifice is FOR something, not a sad political maneuver, or a personal vendetta.  The decision to invade Iraq was based on faulty evidence, the reasons changed while Americans were dying, the invasion left a shattered Iraq that may or may not be able to become a true democracy, it has been divisive domestically and a foreign relation’s disaster, all the while making the United States Military a less effective defense against foreign aggression.  I pray that God have mercy on us for these actions, because our children will not.  I'll leave your interpretation of US foreign policy since WWII for a later date.

      Smell is such a powerful reminder. I'm sure we can all think of a time when we smelled something that reminded of of something - a favorite food, a loved one, childhood memories. The other day I was walking out of the new Gloucester Library and I smelled something slightly salty, like seafood, but very faint (maybe it was from the Blue Fin) and there was a warm breeze and I could see the wooden pillars that used to be there... and I was back in North Carolina, back at our cottage in Nag's Head, on the beach, coming back, salty hair... walking downstairs to the open air shower under the cottage. You know, I miss it. I hate heat. But these are the things that make us who we are. I was given a box of salt water taffy by my grandmother and it made her think of New Jersey, I thought of North Carolina... these memories are what gives us strength when we are alone, why we do things. No one lives in the moment, reflect, see what we've done, where we've been, what there is left to do.

      This is the problem with LJ DJ, we all think we are close, but we know nothing about each other. To rectify this, I want you to ask something you think you should know about me. Something that should be obvious, but you have no idea about.  Then post this in your LJ DJ and find out what people don't know about you.

      Ugh, I have to go back to work today. My goal of the past two days was to spend time with Sarah as she returns from North Carolina and her wife Tiffany. Alas, that has not happened. I did get some money put into my account at Langley, and went with Noah to some places, but didn't even get to speak to Sarah until last night. Even then, most of it was online because my phone died. Maybe that was a good thing. When you're talking on instant messenger, it allows you to pause and consider more of what you want to say, and we did have quite a lot to say. Though I did have to end a conversation with Chelsea when she sounded like she could have really used me, she sounded so sad. Anyway, I'm now in this really annoying situation. Emotionally, I'm on standby - I feel gidddy with excited happiness, and sad and depressed, frustrated at facts out of my control, and reigning in a desire to be overprotective. You see, now that Sarah and I have decided that what we are is dating, now comes the problems of everything else. She says it's best if her parents never know anything, because since she's leaving they would try and stop it and think that she'd be too depressed when she moves and we must part. Her sister or someone is coming or has come and so they may want her to spend more time over there and not let her go out. I'm effectively on car restriction because of my reckless driving ticket, I may have my license revoked, but I can drive once my parents leave on their cruise, if they go. And of course there's the problem of Sarah leaving. Goddam you Arizona... We only have one month and I'm worried that we won't be able to make the most of that time. She makes me so happy. And that's why I feel giddy. She really likes me. She wants what I want. We talked about our feelings and I had little to add other than an echo of what she said. But why? Why now that we're together can't we be together? Dammit, I have to spend time with you Sarah, it's been too long. When was it I last saw you? Saturday? I keep the ticket stub. It was a saturday. the 26th. So like a week and four days. It'll be two weeks. I can't let that happen. Maybe tomorrow. Sometime.

      I seem to be very seperate from my peers in my views on marriage and children. I'm the only one I can think of (I'm sure there are others I can't) who wants to get married, and have children. I want to live in a house somewhere, and have one or two children, a normal life, a job, a wife, go on family vacations, that sort of thing. For some reason, people of my age, generation, personal cliques (mostly of above average intelligence), whatever, don't want to marry, and if they do they don't want children. I'm not saying that this is wrong, but it just seems odd to me that it should be so prevelant a thing. I'm not some bedrock of traditional values; I'm for gay marriage, I'm not even completely straight, and anyone who knows me knows I'm eccentric. I want to travel the world, and unlike those millions who say they'd like to, I definitally will. I have no standard of living to keep. Of course I won't live a normal life in the states, I plan on travelling, hopefully with someone I love, before settling down, in some faraway city, probably two. So what, I'm a romantic, okay? Anyway, I think a lot of it resides in my parents. They're not my people. I seldom get along with them. They don't parent like I would, they don't act like I would. I don't want to live with them. But, they're happy. They didn't provide me with decent housing, but they're really a model of marital relations. They've never seriously quarreled, and love each other dearly. So, sure that I can have the same type of thing, that children will not be in the way of my relationship with another, and wanting to give my children what I never had, and always wanted (isn't that always the reason?) I have a vision of having a traditinal family. Whatever. I need to take a shower.

      I, wanted, this excoriation I, thrive on, this self mutilation summer a morning, so pale alone when they found me as I remained sleeping I heard them say this summer created, a boy of abject misery he was designed by you  Lyrics that now make sense to me, after looking them up, and take on new meaning knowing fully what they say. A beautiful song and one who's meaning I feel is a significant part of my life. Who knows the damage we cause to those we think we know, when we do those things we do. Who knows what lives we save by a a small gift of our grace given offhand in a moment of kindness.

      Knocking began to fill the quiet spaces of the study, disturbing the dignity that they had. The man who sat in the back corner of the room was as much a part of his surroundings as the dusty lamp on the table or the paintings on the wall. This symbiosis was shattered as he rose to answer the persistent knocking. As he opened the door, a man with a noose hanging limply about his seemingly broken neck walked in. “Ah, Death. Good to see you,” the man greeted him, “but don’t you think that you’re being a bit over the top? I mean, this is just too Masque of the Red Death for you.” “Point taken,” said Death, as he took a seat across from his host at a table, “but this is the form in which I present myself to you today.” “A hanging?” He asked. “No,” Replied death, “look at the quality of the noose. It’s obviously home made.” “Oh! A suicide. I see now. Are you trying to get me to kill myself then?” Inquired the man. “You got it,” Said death, “we’ve been friends your whole life and I’ve shown you many things; how to keep yourself company, how to hurt when no one cares. This is just one of your options that I, as the embodiment of Death, am obliged to offer to you.” The man sat across from Death looking more comfortable than most would in this situation. He leaned back and smiled. “Now why would I want to kill myself?” Death took this opportunity to slide out of his chair and begin an overly dramatic stroll about the study. He began to speak, gesturing at the room he walked through, “This room is the room of your mind. You come here to feel safe. In your body you are probably not feeling as safe as you appear here. I know you aren’t.” He paused and looked at the man in the chair. “You know what I’m talking about. I’ve met very few as genuinely self-destructive as you are. You have problems in your life, everyone does, but you get so pushed around by them. Don’t you think that it’s time to let go?” “I’m able to handle it,” defended the man. “Well,” Countered Death, “perhaps you haven’t kept everything in perspective. Your girlfriend moved. You’ve said yourself that things won’t be as easy with anyone else as they were with her. Oh yes, you know there will be others. But you know there will be problems. And you know you don’t fit the molds they have ready for you.” The man stood and began a pace similar to that of Death. He composed himself and then began to counter, “I’ll be able to make it work. We will. And I’ve been comfortable with other people. And some I want to make work.” A smile flickered across Death’s previously blank façade. “Oh, her. Well, you know how that’s going. Need I remind you of all of the conflicts? What does she want? You don’t know but you know that you can’t give it to her. And as for the other you are referring to… well we know where that one’s going. Both ideas. They’re from different worlds. You are here a little too late. Or maybe too early.” “Ok, that’s true. Things were always easier with Sarah. Even in that regard. But you know that we could try…” The man’s voice was becoming more wistful as he lost himself in the objects in the room of his mind. He was toying with a small flag at a stand and wondering what it was reminding him of. Red, black, yellow lines crossed his eyes. Death became more confrontational. “Look, we can’t keep milling on your relationships and relationships you won’t have. That’s the stuff that teenage angst is made of. You know that you go beyond that. Take for instance the problems with your family, your future, and most of all your two private pains. Why do you hurt yourself so?” The man lost his composure for the first time and ran his hands through his hair, turning away from his old friend Death to hid his pained expression. He walked over to an old photo album and leafed through pictures of his youth, pausing at the changes through high school. “You know the answer to that. Here, this is your answer.” Death walked over to the album. “Senior year? Well, yes, I suppose that was your goal. But it hasn’t happened yet. It doesn’t have to be that way. There’s the healthier route. There’s that way. And then there’s simple death. I’m always here waiting for you.” “I can’t do that. I may not have much to live for but I’ll not take my own life,” The man declared, a new sense of purpose resounding in his manner. Death chuckled. “And why not? You and I both know you have nothing to loose when you check out. Nothing you’ll pay for. No afterlife to worry about. And it beats the hell you put yourself through.” “My pain is my own,” the troubled man stated, “Just because I do it myself doesn’t mean that I’m pushed to it. I know the consequences of my actions.” “But what of those who you profess to love? How do these things affect them?” Death asked, “You know that when they find out you’ll only be killing them.” “Yes Death, old friend, but my own death would be worse. And my own optimism is what I have to live for. I know now why. The world was made for people like me. To seize the reigns, to have what is ours. And optimism is not a failed philosophy as you’ve told me all these years, I’ve found a way of reminding myself of that.” He was holding a picture now, a photo of a girl who was smiling next to him on a bed. “This is one last juncture in my life that I’ve past. I think it’s time we both leave this room and get on with our lives.” “Very well,” Said Death, “Until you need me again.”

       The World Of David The Gnome - a personal favorite Sonic The Hedgehog - I played all of the games on Sega Genesis Skinamarink TV - Who could forget Sharon, Lois, and Bram? The Pink Panther - Ahhh, insulation… Fraggle Rock - I don't remember watching but my mom has always insisted I was obsessed when I was like two. I will add more when I remember, but I want all of you to remember your favorite TV shows from yesteryear and comment them in. Or face the consequences.

      I've been thinking a lot about my childhood lately - no reason, just curious. Strange childhood facts - I had a stuffed dog most of my young life named "fluffer" (I don't believe that it fluffed anything nor was it itself fluffy so I don't know where the name came from) that was brown and had leather on its paws. I think my mother still has it. And the moment everyone has been waiting for... My terrible childhood nickname! When I was a baby my mother would dress me in baby boots for the winter and while she went to fetch a coat I would remove them. I hated wearing boots. And so, paradoxially, I was nicknamed "boots." A name I still cringe at to this day. And another entry: old TV shows! I will make another entry devoted to my favorites when I was very small. I want all of you to add to it. Dammit. If you don't I will hunt you down and force you to listen to country music.

      This is what I should be taking next year. I'm going to bitch at the school tomorrow to make sure that they get it all right, but it may change. There is a possibility about them being stupid about letting me redo math analysis. I don't anticipate any problems I can't... make them reconsider. I can be very persuasive.

      Pondering why I follow a pattern of self-destructive behavior, I arrive at no conclusion. I'm a confused masochist. All I can hope for is that what I am becoming is better than that which I have been. I'm optimistic in that regard. There remains one month this summer for me to get my life together. I still have work to deal with, but I still have plenty of time to do what I need to accomplish. I am readying myself to prepare for the future. There are colleges to look at, scholarships to consider, SAT scores to improve, summer reading for AP next year to do, and general studying in the realms of Spanish and French languages, and Basque culture, food, and history. Yes, that's a lot, but my girlfriend has moved across the country and I don't have much occupying my time. So, single and spotting failure looming ahead in the horizon I have decided that I must scurry to assure my place in the moonlight. I'm thinking a lot about school next year - you know this is the part of summer I hate the most, when I begin to miss school. I have a plan for how the year will go. I hope that things go over well with my license and that frivolous reckless driving charge so that I don't have to pay outrageous insurance for my car. Assuming so, and assuming that my car stays in decent shape, I don't want to keep a job. I won't be able to with school hours and the pile of homework I'm sure I'll have. So, I will focus on my school work, strive for the best possible grades, and put that before all other things. I also plan on spending the month of November writing a novel for NaNoWriMo and then the rest of the year editing and adding to it. There will be much writing my senior year, particularly since I have AP English and a creative writing course. I plan on spending much time in bookstores, libraries, and coffee shops. I'll probably do most homework in jitters. Well, I have the best times ahead of me, and confidence inbues my soul with hope that I can in fact accomplish all that I have put off these last three tortuous years. Farewell, lethargy.
