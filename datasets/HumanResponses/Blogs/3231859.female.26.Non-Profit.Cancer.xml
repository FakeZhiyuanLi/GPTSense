      There is a big youth talent quest in Wellington next weekend. It is a YFC event that draws a couple thousand kids from all around...and some good artists have emerged from it. There are lots of catagories from art to music to drama. The different regions around New Zealand compete and get points for wins, kinda like the Olympics. Waikato usually wins the whole thing. Each region does a "Spectacular" which is dance and drama which includes lots of kids, is supposed to be grand, and is 5 minutes long and is some part of Jesus' story.  ...with all that explained I am dancing in it. I just remember when I was ten and took dance lessons and then went to recital and forgot all the steps and just stood there. And the worst part is that I'm right in the front...scary...would it be ok if I ran and hid in the bathroom?

      Just got home from seeing "Troy". I cried.  There is a girl staying with us from America that is a friend of a friend's. She is backpacking around New Zealand. Today we went and saw some stuff. It was fun. It was nice to know this place a little, even if no matter how well I know it, or how much I feel like it's home...I will always stand out because of my accent. That's ok.  It is getting really cold. The office is now cold all day long instead of just in the mornings. I have to huddle by my heater. The days of central heating...how I took it all for granted...

      It's really cold in the mornings in the house. I have set up a system. My alarm goes off at 7:15 at which time I switch on the outlit by my bed and the heater goes on, so when I get up about 7:45ish it's warm in my room. Then I get to work and turn my heater on in my office. It's definitely getting to be winter because I used to be able to turn off the heater midday but now I turn it on throughout the day....oh a New Zealand winter...

      I think I would rather be at work sick than be at home sick with nothing to do. It's so boring!!!!!!!!!!!! I have been sick since Friday but it didn't get bad until this week and I'm trying to keep it from getting worse...as it supposedly will do if I overexert myself. It just makes the body exhausted so I have been sleeping most of the day away. I am looking forward to getting on with things...

      I was in 3 schools this week. It is so good to finally be getting out there and meeting kids. I also had a pottery class which started on Wednesday night. There were about 5 women of all ages. It was really comfortable and enjoyable. I'm so glad I'm doing it...even if I never come out with a masterpiece.  The new bachelor is starting, well, it's new to New Zealand anyway. It's the one with Bob. They showed all the women that they were interviewing saying that there are so many important factors in picking the women, but all must have a good body. That makes me really upset. That's all I'll say about that.  Ahhhh...the weekend.

      So I am the Media Liaison for Atomic Events, an Xtreme sports ministry (BMX biking, skating etc.) It sounds really professional yet today as I faxed a press release to different newspapers I couldn't have felt more ignorant. It will take some time to learn. One things for sure, I'm so glad to be a part of it!! I love being behind the scenes and the ministry is great. It is a blessing.  A quote I paused twice to read twice today:  "We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us: and it is the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds yield their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence."

      Went to a party last night. It was really fun. I realize I am actually starting to get to know people. It feels good. Today is a lazy day but nice to rest up before the busy of the week.   My plans for the rest of the day? Gilmore Girls, reading, pick flatmate up from airport...that's all. Nice and relaxing.

      This week has been really busy. Tuesday night I took club for Wendy who is out of town (in Christchurch) for a couple of weeks. The kids were out of control. I was really frustrated and on the verge of tears the whole time. They wouldn't listen to anyone, tried to steal a basketball from the church we were using that night and then two got into a fight. The most frustrating part is that I myself got frustrated. I want to love them but I don't know how. I prayed on the way home for the kids and to use God's wisdom in dealing with them.   Kelly, my office mate got in a car accident this morning. She's ok, but the car she just recently bought was totalled. Thankfully she is fine and insurance will cover the cost of the car. I think she is a little discouraged about it because her cellphone was stolen this week. Pray for her if you think about it.  Pottery class was supposed to start tonight but was postponed a week. It is actually a blessing in disguise because I'm wasted from last night. Tonight I was able to make supper (evening snack) for club tomorrow night and just relax a little. Much needed.

      It has been a good weekend. Last night went and saw a movie and then came home and rented a movie. Ended up going to bed not too late. Went to church this morning. The pastor spoke about the good samaritan and I was challenged to think about how I was helping people and the world around me...a theme I see coming up frequently these days. Went grocery shopping this afternoon. I am trying to eat healthy although at this very moment I am breaking into a candy bar. There's always tomorrow...

      It is a dreary day in Hamilton, but perfect for a Saturday morning. I am thankful for this peacefulness God has brought. I went to the gym and enjoyed Jane Eyre as I rode the treadmill. Reading quality literature always makes the time pass quickly. Now I am sitting in my kitchen listening to James Taylor. The day has just begun...  New Zealand is a beautiful country. 4 million people live here in this tiny far-from-everything country in the South Pacific. Sometimes it feels very small, other times I feel as if I have been given the world. This is definitely a journey for me. I would never have thought I would be here, but now it's been 6 months, and I can't imagine being anywhere else. "Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will care for itself." That is what God is instilling in my heart as I struggle to understand His plan and where I fit in the grand scheme of things. I am learning about so many things...God, myself, the world...it is all a blessing. I am thankful.

      It is finally the weekend. Tonight was a nice night. Went with my flatmate Mara to a breakdancing competition. We only stayed for a short time but it was cool to watch. We spent the rest of the evening at a cafe. It was nice, not heaps of people there, but nice anyway.

      It's winter here. I have probably mentioned that already, but I want to describe the winter because it is not winter as I know it (snow, bitter cold etc). See, it is definitely winter. Last week I think it even got down to 30F a couple of nights. It almost seems like a cold spring with lots of rain, sometimes hail, and very gray skies. I can't say I can count on that, though, because the last couple of days the sun came out and it was in the 50's and Fri. night we went to a cafe and sat outside. It was a little chilly, but where can you sit outside in the Midwest USA in the winter?  Enough about that. One more week than holiday for a week. Wohoo!!!! I will be able to relax and read and watch some videos and go places if I want and sleep and sleep and sleep...sometimes there doesn't seem to be enough time for that.

      I hate doing laundry. I know, I know, you should never say hate because that means you wish something would die...and I do wish my laundry would die. I don't know why I dislike it so much. I'd rather clean a million toilets. I get to the point where I have to do it but then I dread it even more because there are so many loads and one wash doesn't even seem to make a dent. Then I have to hang it out to dry and without fail it always rains and then my laundry takes at least a week to finally be done. It's so monotonous. I like to do something and just get it done but there are so many waiting times when it comes to laundry. And then there's the folding, the finding places to put everything, the sorting...it drives me mad. Oh well.

      My sister had her baby today. I found out in the morning but was not able to call her until the afternoon. I was away at a school all day but when I got back into the office someone had called with the hospital number so I rang her. It was really good timing because she was all alone in her room with the baby (girl named Millie Grace). Her husband had gone home to pick up some things and it was quiet, so even though I wasn't there I got to enjoy a special moment with her and hear all about the delivery, and the people, and of course the baby.

      My flatmates and I moved into a new house yesterday. The entire time we moved stuff in we kept trying to figure out the subtle smell that filled the air. I'm pretty sure I've never spent so much time talking about something smelly. No worries, though, a few open windows and a few more air freshners later and the whole place smelled like an open meadow filled with flowers.  I have my own shower at our new place. I put a few rocks in it so I'd feel like I was in nature...not quite the same effect but a good try.   Last night I was so hungry I ventured out to the kitchen&nbsp;to conjure up whatever I could find or dig out of boxes. I was taken back by a cockroach making it's way accross the counter as well. He ran into the disposal to hide from me. Although I would have preferred hiding in the disposal from him instead, I wouldn't have want him to turn it on like I did to him. Woops.  &nbsp;

      It is our first day of holiday and it is well needed. I went to Raglan, walked around and looked in shops and sat in a cafe and wrote some letters. On the way home I went to Bridal Veil Falls. The weather wasn't the greatest but it was worth it. The falls are 55m high and a short walk into the bush. It was a nice day, just taking my time and relaxing not thinking about work. It was nice just to allow God to speak through the silence and be thankful for life.  The only bummer was that I took lots of B&W photos with my camera. It was a role of 36 in the camera but when it got to 36 it just kept taking...a sure sign of something not good. So when I got home I went into a dark room and opened the camera only to find that there was no film in it!! Silly.
