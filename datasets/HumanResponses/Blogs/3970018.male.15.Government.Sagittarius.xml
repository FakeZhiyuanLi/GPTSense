       (*.*) 一开始就误会, 关于你的倔强和不妥协, 一离开就后悔 因为你爱的很坚决, 我被缠在一些傻问题, 譬如说用什么爱你......... 如果我就这样离去, 我的心会碎的像玻璃, 天天看到你, 却产生了距离, 爱越热心越冷的关系 ...也许这是我不够勇气 ,去解开你防卫的怀疑, 天天看到你, 是习惯和必须, 不可能跟可能, 我的心面对分离 ....Oh~ 我才知道自己有多爱你...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*.*) 我等着见你一面等过这些年, 我想要从从容容说着好久不见. 我一厢情愿认定你都不会变..... 那一年.... 那个春天....我想要说的全都写在眼里面, 我也曾想过一切可能沧海桑田...... 风影缠绵... 穿过长发谁的思念, 牵挂的你....走的那么远.....  哈罗, 就红了双眼, 哈罗, 又过了一年, 哈罗, 在天黑以前想的万语千言, 哈罗, 却停在你的脸, 哈罗, 何必再相见, 哈罗, 回不到从前, 哈罗, 我瞒不了心痛的那么明显, 哈罗, 难道这就是再见......

      The truth is tearing up my heart, I can't recognize this place, the endless road without a stop sign, cant even find a stranger this time, why am i still holding back my tears, in this loneliness there's nothing to fear, every chord still seems so wonder, how we could be together, everytime i ask if this would be the last, why am i still talking to myself, hoping you will have the keys to my cell, every song might calm the weather, but it just draws me deeper, how do i get out of this, i think i never will... a crystal forming in the eye, maybe THIS will be the last, the winding path down my face, till i begin to taste the bitterness inside.........&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (no.....i realli taste happiness wif u in the past)

       你过的好辛苦, 我比谁都清楚, 感情路没有勉强的幸福, 一开始就给的糊里糊涂......想回头又不知如何结束, 你装作很满足, 我比谁都清楚...... 你的笑, 隐约透露着孤独, 快乐背后, 深深藏着痛楚, 坚强的面对, 然后偷偷的哭, 偷偷的哭..

      1. Should've stopped myself from hurting her. 2. Shoudl've bet on Greece for tt period. 3. Should'nt had given my fav bunny away. 4. Should'nt always cry for her. 5. Should've go to church service every sunday. 6. Should've go to ah du autograph session. 7. Should'nt buy tt 2nd hand mp3 (sold it as 3rd hand to vic liao HOHO) 8. Should'nt play and waste too much time this stupid year. 9. Should've taken better care of my face (holey holey) 10. Should've known tt now i unable to slp cos afternoon nap b4 liao. (tts y blogging)   痛是理所当然....当我们在为爱而惨, 当你说勉为其难....不如我们现在好好的散, 哭是一种答案, 爱情竟然是一道伤, 我心以为地久天长, 爱到最深处心如火烫.....我自己都无法阻挡....希望我的心就是你最想到的地方.....希望这次上天给我.....最慈悲的下场....我自己都无法阻挡, 一个人独自面对整个世界的伤, 就让泪水留驻眼眶....流过你的肩膀, 留在你的心上......

       我想我是太用力, 当我将你的衣, 丢进你的箱子里.... 所以现在我发现, 一部份我自己, 早已跟随着你远去, 我想我是没用力, 当我将你的心, 狠狠丢进冷风里, 所以现在我发现,我自己每一天, 都在练习说对不起......下次如果离开你, 我一定很用力, 才会痛到我恨你, 如果下次不确定....这一次能不能, 让我眼睛可以想你.... 下次如果离开你, 我一定不用力, 才会瞒过我的心.... 可是下次不确定, 这一次能不能... 快点回来让我抱紧.....
