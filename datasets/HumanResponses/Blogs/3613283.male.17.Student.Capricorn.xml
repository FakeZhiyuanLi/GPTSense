      A couple of months ago, my friend Elise and I were talking about gay issues during a trivial conversation as I would call it. Anyway, she precisely told me this:  "You know Julien, progress comes from America" ; meaning social, civil rights. At the time, she seemed to me to be rather in favor of same-sex marriage even though she's right-wing. I didn't really reply to her thought, but I thought it showed a clear misunderstanding of what America really is. It made me realize that people have this view of America that comes from Hollywood, or The Left (most of them at least).  People say  "progress" , I say  "evolution".  One has to make a difference between the two terms as Leo Strauss would stress,  progress really isn't necessarily progress   per se . If you look at the "advance" Europe has on social issues, it's stunning. Does it make the countries of Europe better? Absolutely not. I would tend to say it's the contrary.   One has to assess the various impacts that a change in policy has.  People have lots of ideas but no depth when it comes to explaining their so-called ideas.   Post-Scriptum:  No later than a week ago, Elise told me that she had a debate on gay marriage and she decided she didn't support it. I personally have still no position on this issue.

      Over the past week, people here and there have started to  compare the current President, George W. Bush, with Ronald Reagan . Well, Veronique de Rugy who researches tax and budget policy and financial privacy at the  American Enterprise Institute  says otherwise, at least when it comes to budgets for the various departments. Indeed, Reagan constantly cut domestic spending while Bush 43, well...didn't.   urlLink AEI: What Should President Bush Learn from President Reagan?

      I told you a couple of days ago that I had to go to the U.S. Embassy in Paris. It was a long, harassing day. Hours of waiting in various lines. I can tell you,  getting an American visa is not an easy journey.   When I arrived at the embassy, my first thought was "I should have taken a camera!". There were literally, early in the morning, a  loooong line of people waiting to enter the building . It was impressive. The whole street was virtually packed with people eager to get in. When U.S. officials such as Donald Rumsfeld tell you "people are lining up to come to the United States",  they're damn right!

      There's an awful lot of material available on the internet - including videos - depicting Saddam's tortures to its people for over 30 years. The media isn't covering it...what a surprise! Well, it's not like people were not aware of what occured there. There is no soldier abusing prisoners, no scandal, no ratings surge, so I guess that's not worth airtime.  For the last 30 years, Iraqis inside Iraq had little knowledge of the full extent of Saddam Hussein's oppressive tactics. Many Iraqis who have documented his regime's history argue that Coalition authorities have not done enough to make this history known to the Iraqi people, and proponents of more stringent de-Baathification argue that until this education is completed, Saddam-era officials cannot be trusted with the rule of the new state.  urlLink AEI Events: Graphic video of Saddam's Tortures

      Have you seen the pictures of Johnson's body? I did. It's awful to see. I didn't even saw them on purpose. I wasn't aware I was clicking on a link leading me to them.  Was it unexpected? Oh no!  I am pretty sick of Saudi Arabia  and its thousands of Princes. Prince Bandar and the spokesman...hum...Adel? They're  hypocrits . I just can't stand them. Kids are taught that Westerners (Jews, Christians...) are  pigs who must rot in hell  and then they want to make friends? Oh no thanks!   Saudi Arabia is America's biggest enemy . After all, most of the hijackers of 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia. Bin Laden is a Saudi. The police forces there work for the gov't during the day, and at night, they put on their terrorist outfit. Let me tell you, there will come a time when the U.S. administration won't have to obey Saudi Arabia anymore and we'll smash them like a bug. Yes, they're the free world's biggest enemy. We just can't say it. Yeah, there's oil so  sshhh .  Don't ask, don't tell. Get it?

      As you may have seen this morning,  President George W. Bush defended the administration's claim that Iraq and al-Qaeda were conducting meetings ...etc even after the 9/11 commission said that there are no proof to back up the claim.  This morning, as I was driving towards the U.S. Embassy, I was listening to France's largest radio and guess how the 7am newscast began? " The reason for the war in Iraq was a BIG LIE!"  the host said with a very  enthusiastic  voice. I can tell you it was really astounding how unfair, biased, unbalanced, deceitful the newscast was.  Anyway, there is no question that Saddam and Usama established contacts, it's documented. Were they planning things?  Don't know.  Did the U.S. administration ever said Saddam had orchestrated 9/11?

      I watched some shows on various French channels today and I was stunned, literally by the opinions I heard.  Opinions that I had never heard before.   First, on France 5's debate show with various guests who were all insisting that  lots of good things are happening in Iraq  and also saying that people should try to distance themselves from the pictures of attacks they see in the media because they said that after all,  there is life in Iraq and that freedom and democracy are coming.   Then, I switched to Canal+ which  usually is the socialist propaganda channel.  They teased a debate about Mike Moore's F 9/11 so I thought "Alright, this is going to be funny". Well, all the guests said that Mike Moore wasn't interested about the truth, that all he was doing was a fiction, not a documentary but that it was great to have this guy around. One journalist invited said he saw the movie and he found it  very disturbing and dangerous  if it was taken as actual information. Even the host uttered "Well, even if he isn't telling the truth..."  All in all, very weird day on French television.

      Some have told me that  calling myself a dissident was hyperbolic . It just can't be that terrible, they say. Well, actually it is!  See, very early in the morning tomorrow, I'm going to the U.S. Embassy in Paris to get a visa because I'm moving to Michigan. Anyway, my father will drive me there, and I said, "Dang, if there's a problem, I can't even have my cell phone to contact you from the inside!". He replied by saying  "Americans are just crazy".  He refered to the security measures  (no bags, no phone...etc).   First, I replied to him  to just shup up   (in diplomatic terms)  since everyone does that now, just go to the France Central Bank, the same rules apply. Second, I told him that I was very disappointed that after reading an essay about Anti-Americanism, he still had those ridiculous comments.  You see, that's what bugs me about France, even though my father is not French, he has the mindset. It's not occured to him that after all these threats the embassies have faced, they might want to consider having some security rules. I hate it here. I just want to get the hell outta here!

      President Bush and Afghan leader Hamid Karzai met in Washington for talks about Afghanistan's future. I have to say after almost three years,  I'm impressed by the ongoing commitment of the U.S. there . I believe that Afghanistan isn't progressing as fast as Iraq. Of course, we hardly ever hear about the situation there. There's actually a quote from Bush that says:  "This is hard work. And it wasn't easy work in Afghanistan by the way. I mean, it seems easy now that we're standing here after several years of working together with this great leader, but it was hard work..."  Bush is not the best speaker as we know all but this quote  sums it up quiet nicely .  Finally, this morning on CNN International on the European morning program 'CNN Today', one of the host was interviewing a guy from Christian Aid which is an organization involved in helping Afghans cope with their daily problems (water, security...).  He painted a somewhat disturbing picture , saying that Afghanistan wasn't safe at all and it was worsening. Listening to those comments, Allison Bell, the host, tried to get a quick YES/NO type of answer. Here's the script:   Bell, host : And quickly, a final yes or no question, is Afghanistan improving?  Christian Aid member : Yes, it's better than it was.   That wraps it up!   urlLink Channelnewsasia.com: Bush/Karzai Meeting

      There is a new book out titled "Michael Moore Is A Big Fat Stupid White Man", you definitely have to get it. Here's what the book cover says  "Watching Michael Moore in action -- passing off manipulating facts in Bowling for Columbine, spinning statistics in Stupid White Men and Dude, Where's My Country?, shamelessly grandstanding at the Academy Awards, and epitomizing the hypocrisy he's made a king's fortune railing against -- has spurred authors David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke to take action into their own hands."  Now, Mike Moore, who seems to be making the news a lot lately said he had footage of prisoner abuse in Iraq long before the atrocities captured international attention, but decided to stay quiet until his new movie came out:  "I had it months before the story broke on '60 Minutes,' and I really struggled with what to do with it, I wanted to come out with it sooner, but I thought I'd be accused of just putting this out for publicity for my movie. That prevented me from making maybe the right decision."

      You now know I'm an avid reader of the  AEI's commentaries . Well, this one commentary highlights some of the negative but also positive effects of America's involvement in Iraq.    "Our most fatal mistake was in the failure to understand that  liberation means liberation .  Iraqis were thrilled to be rid of Saddam Hussein, and rightly so.   No one should denigrate the enormous accomplishment of our troops , nor the relief felt by the Iraqi people that they could live in freedom.  But Iraqis who had lived for decades under a ruthless tyrant did not want him removed in order to be governed by foreigners."  "America has done an incredible service for the Iraqi people.  It is important to remind people that we did a great and a noble thing, and to understand that if we continue doing the right thing for the people of Iraq, they will be grateful, and will build a country that will be an invaluable ally."  Yes,  it was right , but  mistakes were made  according to Danielle Pletka who is the vice president for Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute.  To those who today have the nerve to say that America's war was illegal, don't come in ten years telling us how great it is to make business with Iraq, the new free society within the Mideast. Because it will happen.   urlLink AEI: Core Mistakes in Iraq

      A commentary published today in  The Washington Times  by Steven Milloy reveals the new vicious strategy that is being put in place by environmental extremist supporters.   "The sort of pressure used by the global warming activists is not the usual one of forcing corporate managements to cave in under the threat of bad publicity. Instead, the activists become shareholders of publicly owned companies, attempting to steer corporate policy under the guise of being corporate "owners."  During 2003, these activist shareholders filed resolutions with more than 25 companies, urging them to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. None of the resolutions came close to passing, but in some cases they received significant shareholder support: 32 percent at ChevronTexaco; 27 percent at American Electric Power, the largest coal-fired U.S. electricity generator; 23 percent at General Electric; 21 percent at ExxonMobil."    urlLink Washington Times: Revamped Green strategy

This morning, I was doing a final in World History and Geography. The topic I chose was "The struggle of Algeria". It was about French colonization. At this point, you might be wondering: why in hell is he talking about Baghdad and Algeria?  As I was writing a paragraph of the essay some three hours into the exam, I wrote something to that extent:   "Numerous fightings are taking place on Algeria's territory. In the newspapers, one can notice the broad diffusion of violence: lots of innocent victims die during the attacks perpetrated by rebel forces. France's military presence is significant though; indeed, one fifth of all French soldiers are stationed in Algeria"   (this from my draft)   Does it sound familiar?    urlLink Read the story out of Baghdad on FOX's website.

      I found this from Slate via Wizbang, and I think it's pretty interesting...    One of the many problems with the American left, and indeed of the American left, has been its image and self-image as something rather too solemn, mirthless, herbivorous, dull, monochrome, righteous, and boring. How many times, in my old days at The Nation magazine, did I hear wistful and semienvious ruminations? Where was the radical Firing Line show? Who will be our Rush Limbaugh? I used privately to hope that the emphasis, if the comrades ever got around to it, would be on the first of those and not the second. But the meetings themselves were so mind-numbing and lugubrious that I thought the danger of success on either front was infinitely slight.

      It's always great to read some of AEI's commentaries on the issues of the day. I've spotted a rather optimistic yet realistic analysis on the Iraq situation by Joshua Muravchik, a resident fellow at the American Entreprise Institute.  He concludes by saying  "The shining model that Washington once hoped it could make of Iraq has shown itself to be an illusion. Still, if an elected government follows, and with it the emergence of a more open and livable society than Iraq had known before, then Bush's strategy may yet be on the road to success."

      This is a time when I'm extremely busy: I got my finals results and I passed them, which means I can go to Michigan. I'll be travelling in early August to my 'new home'.    Thoughts  I was delighted to see Saddam in court, althought I was a bit pissed off by his rhetoric, it really is a very important symbol to the Iraqi people, that's for sure.  On the Iraq handover, I'm surprised that the terrorist attacks haven't  really  increased, and the situation isn't getting out of hand which is a good point for the new Iraqi interim government. I'd like everyone to remember, as I've already said, in 5, 10, 15 years that sooo many people were extremely critical and I hope that these guys  (i.e. Jacques Chirac)  will not dare say how great 2010 Iraq is.  Now I'm off partying :)

      ...you're so busy, you keep forgeting updating your blog? Between meeting that friend for lunch, that other one over the afternoon and the parties at night: life after our finals here in France is extremely active. Indeed, I apologize for my abscence these past days.  Moreover, do you think much happened this past week to talk about? I don't. June 30th will be both an exciting and most likely bloody day including the days that will follow. On a long-term basis, I'm pretty much convinced that the Iraq operation will be a success, it  has  to be a success.

      A recent poll shows that Bush edges Kerry by a comfortable margin. Of course, things will keep moving till the election and the October/November polls will matter most.   Even as insurgents increase their attacks in the days leading up to the June 30 handover, the public’s belief that going to war with Iraq was the right thing to do is holding steady. Majorities believe there was a partnership between Saddam and Al Qaeda, and that military action abroad is necessary to protect from having to fight terrorists on U.S. soil. In addition, brightening impressions on the condition of the economy helped President Bush improve his standing against Democrat John Kerry this week, according to a Fox News poll released Thursday.    urlLink You Decide 2004 Poll - 06/24/04: Bush Edges Kerry

      As you may already know, I'm getting ready to move to Michigan, so that's the first reason why I've not been updating my blog for quite a while. The second reason is that I'm in the south of France right now on holidays and I only have a dialup connection down here which is really a bore. That's why I only check out my emails every now and then and get the latest news on FOX's and CNN's websites. Yeah, no cable here. I'm missing lots of things happening including DNC coverage which is not shown on France's broadcast networks obviously. I'll be back in the North of France on July 31st, that's the date I'll blog again. Until then, don't forget about this blog.
