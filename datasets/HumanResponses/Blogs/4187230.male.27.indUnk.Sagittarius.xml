      As we get closer to the election, an interesting sub-theme has come out of the left's rabid Bush-bashing. The belief that the public's and/or private companies' response to the free speech of the stars is somehow censorship.  These pampered babies want their cake and they want to eat it. They want to be able to say whatever they want (although its only covered if its against Bush) and they do not want any backlash from their actions. Back when the Dixie Chicks made their outlandish comments about President Bush, numerous stations (both radio and television) refused to play their songs and videos. The left immediately cried censorship, depsite the fact that the comments of Dixie Chicks, which are protected by free speech and rightly should be, offended these stations' core audiences.  The reality is that if you are the public eye and your livlihood depends on the public's perception of you then you have to aceept that the public might reject you for your statements and actions. Furthermore, you might feel financial pain through the rejection of citizens and corporate entities, who by the way are only exercising their rights of free expression to ignore your work because of your statements.  The reality is quite simple if you feel as strongly as your statements suggest you do, then you must be willing to accept the consequences of your actions.  Censorship is not allowing to speak your mind at all, which is a vile and evil repression. IT IS NOT, however, the boycotting or refusal to purchase or promote the wares of the speaker.  In other words, freedom of speech does not grant freedom from speech.  You can be held accountable for your statements and actions and that might cost you, but its not censorship.   That's all for now.  Tune in Next Time... Same Bat-Time, Same Bat-Channel.  Cheers. JB

      Well, I'm new to this whole blogging craze, but I thought I would give it a shot.  If nothing else, this is a site for providing the reviews of movies and such I think should be published.   I think the media and in particular entertainment reviewers want us to be hip and trendy (read their word "cultured") that they have forgotten that we want to be entertained. Especially in the summer.   Give a three treatise of the devastation and futility of war - but give it to me in December when I am ready to hunker down in a theatre. In the summer, give a me a movie where stuff blows up.   Well, that pretty much says it all right there.  Tune in next time, same Bat-time, same Bat-channel.  Cheers. JB
