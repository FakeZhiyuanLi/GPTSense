						   I started running the other day.  Today I lasted 24 minutes in the ever famous (possibly infamous) Waterloo fog.  Which, considering about 2 weeks ago it hurt to go the length of my hallway in my appartment buildong this isn't so bad.  On Sun I'd say honestly I ran a decent 30 min (sans fog), I don't really know if that's good or not, being as I'm not a big "runner".  What is that anyway?  Do I have to pay hundreds of dollars and get a fancy matching outfit these days to go for a run?  Do I need one of those reflecting jackets and a pair of 500.00 runners to go a couple blocks?  Well my current financial situation prohibits any of that from actually becoming a reality, so a new topic I think is advisable.  Talked to Anne today, she was a little sad due to her current financial situation, but I cheered her up by telling her a joke, that I will now share with all of you (which is still no one as I have not told anyone I am blogging but that is besides the point).  Hear about the new pirate movie?  Its rater arrrrrr!  Ha I love it!  Melissa equally enjoyed that one.  I have just been querey'd as to weather I am going to go for a cigarette any time soon by my room mate, a.k.a. code for can I take the dogs out? Hee hee!!!  I swear she likes the fact that I smoke because it means I go out late at night...  Ha!  Its cool though.  I prefer the balcony, but walking the rug rats has its advantages too, when I know what they are, I'll share them with you...  I think I'll blog more later re: the dog's party and Emma being possed by the devil himself, I've taken to calling her the spawn of satan which Melissa doesn't really appreciate but I know she's laughing inside!  Off to walk the dogs!

						   Even though the weather hasn't been all that wonderful, I know its summer because I got my first mani/pedi the other day and that means no more shoes.  So I had this really weird dream last night, I dreampt that Kim and I went shopping to this wicked store it was sort of half skater half preppy but everything was exspensive and gorgeous.  I ran into Dave Fauteaux there and some other random's that I recognised, I brought my 35 mm camera and started taking pictures of everyone while also stealing clothes?  For the record, Kim stole a brown leather jacket for me and I stole a bunch of stuff for her...  Does that mean I'm a thief or a photographer?  Perhaps it just means, I need to do some serious shopping.  Well not today, today I have the pleasure of sitting in the library.  Boyz...  hmm, went on a date with Claudio, he seemed nice, we are supposed to go out again tonight, but I'm going to have to rain cheque because I want to stay at the library till it closes, I have to get my ass in gear, its already mid-term time - I mean seriously, holy fuck, where did all the time go?  I do however have to call Jason, I keep forgetting and by the time I remember I dont want to call because its to late, I hope he doesn't think I'm a shit for not calling for so long.  We'll just have to wait and see I guess.  Alright, I've discovered a wonderful way to procratonate, perhaps one of the best is by blogging...    I still haven't told anyone about the web site address and I'm debating really who to tell.  Will I make this more like a dictionary or a blog?  I think a blog is my best bet cuz when you start digitalizing your skeleton's, I'm sure only bad can come from that!!!  Till next time Tonto...???  WTF?

						   This wont be anything profound, it's more a test to see if I have the hang of this blog business.  People are always telling me that I have a "flare" or is it "flair" for writing and that they enjoy the novel sized e-mails I send home at random.  Rather then bombard e-mail inbox's I thought I'd try my hand at blogging.  I read a couple blog's every so often, that of Barlow www.barlowonline.com and my friend Paul at which time I cannot seem to locate that particular address but I promise to post it another time.  So I googled free blog web sites and this is what I found.  So far, not so good...  Am I nervous?  Is it possible I have nothing to say?  That can't be it...  Maybe it's the pressure to actually come off intelligent and have some interesting topics like world politics and the environment (which for the record from what I've seen is what mose blog's are like) that's making this painfully dull?  Ok anything new to report? Tried to go see Barlow over the weekend in Ottawa, the Tulip festival actually and it was cancelled due to inclemant weather (rain).  The one day this beautifull long weekend that I didn't want it to rain, typical.  I guess I'll just have to wait till they come to the Bomber in June, in the mean time, I will think about how cute Damian the drummer is and hold onto that for the next month.  I wonder if I can post pictures?  If I can I will write all about my trip to Banff before I either A) Kill the brain cells that encompass the memories of the trip with alcohol or drugs or B) procrastonate for so long that I actually forget the trip or even C) ....  nah this one is going to be another kill the brain cells reference and I think we all know that's the most likely outcome.  How does one end a blog? Like this? Bye? I guess I'll learn as time goes on, I welcome comments and help, but please be nice, I'm just one person with nothing all that interesting to say, so if you do not like it, go harass someone who's trying to induce antics.  ;)

						   FOR THE RECORD and I've been saying this for at least 2 years now.  TANNING IS BAD!!!!!!!!!  TANNING BEDS ARE WORSE...  Ok, its like this... So the thing that gives you cancer (MELANOMA) are the UV's from the sun, riiiiight....  So then WHY on EARTH would you want strong forms of that UV at close proximity to your face and body?  And from LIGHT BULBS?  How can we as educated, intelligent people feel that this makes any sense?  I mean you can say its the pot calling the kettle black in that I don't get an opinion because I smoke... and fine go ahead and say that, you have that right just as I can rant on my blog about the potentially useful brain cells that are wasted when the thought process occurs for one to purchase an "all you can tan for x dollars" and feels that this is a "GOOD DEAL".    Seriously though now that I've ranted about the evils of having that much condenced sun harnessed into a little coffin like box and blasted at your soft skin for 15+ straight minutes.  There was an article in the Toronto Star today that warns against the dangers of the fake and bake.  Which in my opinion besides the evils of things like the CANCER there are things like LEATHER SKIN and WRINKLES and best of all NO ONE TANS ORANGE IN REAL LIFE... but sorry, back to the Star (E8) tanning has gotten so out of control in places like California that the state has actually propsed to pass a LAW against tanning.  Yes folks its come to this, a law against everything...  Listen up though; the article reports such things as "mounting medical research that links the activity to serious health problems" & "after and eight (yes 8)year study of Scandanavian women who frequent tanning booths users were 55 percent (55 that's more then half) more likely to develop malignant melanoma then non-users".  Yup that's right malignant melanoma is also known as THE BIG C...  And after doing a little research and finding out that not only is melanoma the worst kind of skin cancer its none to pretty either.  So this LAW IN CALIFORNIA that they are trying to have passed is thinking of imposing a $2,500 fine a day on salons should minors be caught tanning, that is anyone under the age of 18.  BECAUSE ITS BAD...  Point is, I could probably quote the article word for word and it may make a difference but it may also not make a lick of difference so if you want to borrow the paper just ask.  Think about this, next time your yellowed ass asks me to stop smoking why don't we each sit side by side and wait to meet one another at the cancer ward instead.  Then we can have a battle of the whits or a battle of who's better and healthier then whom or even a who's cancer is better (not funny) until we rot away from years of abuse regarless of the sunstance.  No I haven't quit smoking yet but it doesn't mean that I can't have an opinion, kettle or not.  There are so many ways to get cancer without actually messing with the outside or inside of our body's why do we give it help (myself included)?  I mean a very special friend of mine has hodgekins and she didn't do anything, she just stood there and it got her anyway (love ya Wilson), but its not going to beat her!!!  I would like to say I like me the way I came out, but I don't think I had black lungs when I was born nor a slightly enlarged liver, I'm just as aweful to the skin I'm in as the next guy so instead I end with this.  Make decisions based on whatever, stupid they may be, but make them informed and try for a while, to not force your decisions on others, because like the cliche, the grass is always greener and no one is perfect just because you think it makes sense (like I do this whole tanning bed thing) others may not see it that way.  Rant done for now...

						   This question I pose to you the audiance.  What is an appropriate level of behaviour when communicating with your pet?  One person said that people who have "conversations" yes full out talks not splices of chopped up words that most of us are used to, but actual conversations are no longer considered "eccentric" but rather quite intelligent.  It was also brought to my attention that dog's have the ability to learn up to 300 words, that being an "exstensive" doggy vocabulary, (I however think they were only talking about the far superior cognitive canine's like Sheppards, Golden's, Lab's etc. who are used as assisted living dog's, but nothing was specified as far as I know so we'll leave it open to interpretation) this being said supposedly it means those people who carry on complete conversations with their pet's are therefore more cognitively superior humans?  Does that make sense?  Or perhaps does one who is a capable human being of the higer end on the intelligence scale search out random facts like these to justify what would otherwise be known as odd (eccentric) behaviour.  On that note, I also would like to mention I feel that people who are eccentric do more then just talk to their pet's its more of a lifestyle you embrace not one action you adopt.  I then also feel it is inappropriate to use eccentricity to define one who carries on conversations with their pets. That being said Princeton on the web defines eccentric as a person of a specified kind (usually with many eccentricities); "a real character"; "a strange character"; "a friendly eccentric"; "the capable type"; "a mental case"...  so I guess I'm wrong and perhaps eccentric is an appropriate word after all?  You tell me...

						   Ever noticed how sometimes you can go from one extreme to another?  Am I the only one?  Does that make me some sort of manic? Sometimes some things just shoot me right down and others shoot me right up.  For instance, I heard a friend ran into my Mom in the grocery store and it made me happy because I thought to myself, what a good friend I know, he knows my Mom and he stopped to say hi to her, I'm lucky.  Then not even 10 minutes later another friend told me about her Canada plans and mentioned everyone that was going, and all of a sudden I dropped right down mostly out of jealousy for having not been invited, but regardless here I am.  Up down, up down...  This has become much more of a diary then anything else, sorry to bore ppl with the ramblings from inside my head...

						   Ok so I new it was just in passing the bad/sad mood. I am as usual procrastonating on an assignment and have come to the realisation, I'm just not going to make it in the real world.  I have no respect for time management and no adhearance to deadlines.  Today is Fathers Day, and tomorrow is the first day of summer, my Dad is at the cottage and its 14 degrees out, what does that tell you?  Nothing?  Do they have a kids day?  Probably...  Ok this is probably my worst blog ever, I have nothing of importance to talk about and from the looks of it so far, nothing is even coherent.  Clearly this is just procrastonation, and I can't even do that right.  Better get back at it!

						   Humans are funny creatures.  I know sometimes you look at your dog's and cat's and think to yourself, they're a little sad today.  Why is it then that humans who seem to have much more control over things then the average house pet still get overwhelmingly sad sometimes?  Is it a moment in time?  An actual event perhaps...  But sometimes we just get sad for no perticular reason.  Or maybe humans in general don't get this way and its just me?  I don't know really.  I probably should being that at one time I was a psych major.  For me, today is one of those days.  I just finished watching a really heart warming movie "love actually" (everyone must see this movie) which should have left me feeling good in the end, a sort of boy meets girl, boy gets girl type of film, that left me instead feeling empty.  That's life I guess...  Terrible metaphor, but so true in some cases.   Saw Barlow last night, and "ran" into Damien, he's just such a charmer, I guess its the rock star allure.  I wonder if when you sign a record deal or maybe its even before that (during music lessons), I wonder if they pull you aside and make you attend a rock star charm school?  Is that possible?  Or is it the opposite you are charming to begin with therefor capable as a rock star.  Regardless, there's just something about them all.  I woke up with a terrible hangover and a smile and now I sleep tonight sad.  I guess you could say love is like cocaine (not at all that I even remotley love Damien) maybe better say; human emotion is like a roller coaster of cocaine.  In that, the high is so perfectly wonderfull in the begining that you never want it to end, but it has to and then its so sad afterwards... Well this is all a bunch of b.s. and honestly a bit theraputic ok a lot theraputic, I'll be in a better mood tomorrow...  Keep on Trucken...

						   The meaning of friendship is different to everyone as are the meanings of each friendship you have.  Some people come in and out of your life for a period of time and mean more to you then people you've known half your life.  Others only pop in once and leave an impression on your heart that lasts a life time.  None are any better then the other, they just are what they are.  There are also those that give your life meaning, the one's that make your heart hurt when you don't talk everyday, that freind that makes everything different when she/he is not around; the sun doesn't shine the same and something is just not right.  Regardless of your friend "position" (for lack of a better word) in life each person that contributes makes me who I am today.  I am humbled by the fact that I have any of these relationships to speak of.   I don't really know where I'm going with this entry I guess mostly I was just thinking how grateful I am that I have people in my life to share happy things with.  It warms my heart to know that you are there, to each of you that reads this, thank you for being my friend and sharing your lives with me regardless of how often we actually make memories...

						   I'm sure everyone has thought to themselves.  Why?  Or What the fuck shit man (okay maybe not that last one) but we've all thought sentiments the like.  I often find myself perplexed when it comes to one individual.  I think we all know who I'm talking about when I say WTFSM (what the ...), yes the one the only, girls... "The Vegas".  So, I haven't talked to him in months and I still find myself wondering about it.  What happened last time that was so bad, or what did I do etc.  One could go off the deep end asking unanswerable questions like that.  I guess the question I pose is, does that ever go away?  Does "The Vegas" ever turn into a shady quebec casino and relinquish "The Vegas" title to someone more deserving or is he perpetually to remain the unatainable?  In true casino style, can you ever beat the house?  Can one live in Vegas and take in all the sparkle and glam or are you always a spectator looking in at its awe and wonder?  How does one person or Vegas rather, sneak into your thoughts constantly and take over without conscent?  What is it that makes us follow the light?  Is it the money, the chance of winning?  Is he like that?  Do I needlessly hold on to the possibility of what could be?  Or perhaps I like it this way and it is I that is unatainable and closed off because I need something to wonder about?  I need that light to follow?  Is that even a realistic possibility?  Why would I give up the chance to beat the house?  Hmm I think not!  Will I ever know?  Is Vegas supposed to be all glitz and glam so I'll keep going back and it (he) will never lose its alure?  Maybe I'm not ever supposed to beat the house, maybe he likes the plateau he sits on above all others looking down.  Or maybe just maybe I make to much out of things and I like the "drama" we all strive to avoid constantly in our lives?  Maybe it gives me something to talk about?  I guess its like they say, don't hate the playa hate the game.  I think the real question is would he even be my "Vegas" if I had beat the house on the first try...  No, sadly we all knew that answer, but he'll always have some title and he'll always steal the spot light, he'll always be the headliner regardless of where the location, seedy Quebec casino or Vegas...  Thanks Vegas or not so much...

						   To begin I would like to borrow something I heard earlier today on Sex and the City.&nbsp; Carrie inspired me&nbsp;as she always does: "soul-mate, two small words one profound statement" and it got me to thinking.&nbsp; As it did her may I add, is there really such a thing as a soul mate?&nbsp; Is there really one person for all of us?&nbsp; I mean, I can admit, I've been in love, I was fortunate to know that feeling, but soul mate seems so ever lasting and so unatainable.&nbsp; Maybe we make people out to be our soul mates because they somehow have a quality we would like to have in ourselves or maybe we think someone is our soul mate because we can't have them and they somehow seem better then they actually are.&nbsp; Are we all wearing rose coloured glasses when were single and it comes to dating?&nbsp; Why then when you finally have a boyfriend are those rose coloured glasses suddenly very, very clear and there aren't any roses at all?&nbsp;  Does having a boyfriend make you part of a soul seeking elite group?&nbsp; Or are you more a member of that group when you're single?&nbsp; Do you ever know?&nbsp; Is that why people get engadged?&nbsp; Or is it maybe because you just found someone you're comfortable sharing your life with? Are there boundaries to each relationship even the soul-mate one's?&nbsp; Should you not let down your boundaries in order to persue a true realtionship?&nbsp; Should you give it your all even if you don't think you see a future with someone&nbsp;in case that person is your soul mate?&nbsp;  Truth be told I just don't know anymore...&nbsp; I used to think that there was that someone for each of us, that one person that you just sort of fit with.&nbsp; But, I think now that I've found a couple grey hairs, some wrinkles, and had my 25th birthday, it might be time to be a little more realistic and not turn down the little less then perfect guys and pay attention to the "nice" one's.&nbsp; I have this image in my head when I think of growing old with someone, sometimes it's a specific person and other times its just an image.&nbsp; Like a white picket fence,&nbsp;and a bunch of babies running around - hunh, who knows for sure. Well that's all for now, I'll give this boyfriend thing a test run, but who knows...&nbsp; He's not my type, but he is nice...

						   Why do we humans spend so much of our life trying to aspire to an unrealistic body type? I am not preaching in least, if anything I am playing the pot calling the kettle black as I too am plauged by the social need to look like Brittney Spears or Jennifer Aniston. Is it really possible to have a world of 5'10's &amp; 120 pounders? If every person weighed about the same and looked about the same without their clothes off, who then would we aspire to look like? Would then the ideal image change from Britney Murphy clones to maybe Rosanne Barr, or maybe a little less dramatic like any one of the Dixie Chicks? I'm not going to make this political and go into the disasterous world of eating disorders etc., but I was just wondering what the world would be like if we all had killer abs and flat tummies...? I wonder if when one of the killer ab'd folk dies and a loved one is reading their eulogy, do they say something like, "what a wonderful, kind person, always so giving etc etc (cuz you can't say bad things about the dead - even if its true) and man what killer abs". I mean at age 60 - 100 what will the ab's have turned into? Ever watch those infomercials like 6 second abs, or ab-meister and the like, there's always that token 60+ year old to intice even the senior's market into buying the equipment, it's gross. And can we talk about what having a grandma with better ab's then me would do to my self image? Aren't most women on average a size 10 anyway? Why on earth would my grandmother want "great abs"? I mean not to say that just because she's a grandma she shouldn't look good, but eeeww a six pack on a 60 year old, what would you do with all the skin? Ha, ok now I'm just being ignorant, and I probably lost my point somewhere a couple sentences ago, so I'll shy away from senior's weight lifting. If I didn't lose my point or fail to make an argument so far I'm about to, because I'm gonna go for a run and do some sit up's so I too can look like Brittney Spears and Jennifer Aniston!!! If there was a way to roll my eyes on this blog, I'd be doing it right now. K p.s. I wonder if having a great body would make me a better person? I wonder if I had killer abs would I have to forfit something I already have like a charming personality in order to have both? Can you have the best of both worlds? Can you have killer abs and be a killer person? Probably, and I envy you. I however have never had killer abs so I wouldn't know (well except when I was 15 but no one knew cuz well, I was 15 and having killer abs wasn't in 10 years ago for a 15 year old) I mostly wore big t-shirts and was awkward about my skinny, muscular skiing body. Ahh the good 'ol days!!! Ha ha ahhahahahhaaaa!!! p.p.s. Why are the most finely fit and tuned athletes in the world, the 5 most top athletes and most of the people going to the olympics not all 6-packed out? I noticed recently that they are more just flat stomached, they don't really have a 6-pack, and they are the most fit ppl in the world? Hmm makes you think? Abs or fit?
