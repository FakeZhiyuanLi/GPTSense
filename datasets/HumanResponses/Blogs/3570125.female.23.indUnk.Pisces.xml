       Hi again...It's me of coarse.  Today I woke up thinking today would be different.  The other day a woman came into my job and she was pretty and I always flirt with her when she comes in.  This time I almost asked her out when "K" called my cell.  I love her I really do but we aren't a couple, and every time this one woman is around it's like she can just tell because she calls me.  Oh well, maybe next time I'll get her number.  But on to other highlights, I'm broke.  Actually I'm worst then broke I'm soo broke I think I might have to go and beg my dad for some cash to pay the bills this month.  See, my sister is always getting money from our dad.  I don't have any money I work a full time job and live paycheck to paycheck supporting me, myself, and "K" (right now she is going through bankruptcy while working 2 jobs so I pretty much have to pay for everything).  My siblings and I have very little cash, my sister has two kids and a husband that doesn't work and sleeps until 1-2pm, great role model for the kids huh?  Yeah, that's what I think.  However, our dad isn't poor like us, he has cash.  He has three vehicles, is getting ready to buy another, bought me my car (that I paid him back for!), my sister's car, my brother's car, has a brand new 280k house with 5 bedroom, 2bths, an office, and a billiards room, setting on 2 acres with a pool.  So, you see he has money, but its his money and that's what he tells us.  If we need anything its really hard to borrow it from him because he wants to see exactly "Why" we need to borrow from him.  Once, he pretty much audited me.  He took all my pay check stubs, personal checking receipts., etc,...And then and only then when he saw that I was trying to make ends meet did he loan me some cash.  He tells me all the time that just because he is my father and raised me that he doesn't owe me a thing, that if I want something from I'm gonna have to stand in line when he dies to get my share.  Can you believe that?  I mean really..Oh well, I guess I'm need to start getting all my bill info together and start crawling to his house to get some help.  Don't get me wrong-My dad loves me very much he just doesn't like the choices I have made in my life.  He doesn't care that I am a lesbian, hell he still talks to some of my ex's but he doesn't like the fact that I haven't gone back to colledge.  To him money is everything and with out a colledge education you can't get any where near money these days, so in a way I have failed him...But in others I know I have made him proud.  Out of all his children I am the only one to graduate from High school and to even go to colledge, I am the only one that has held a steady job, and I am the only one he says he doesn't have to worry about.  Last year when he got really sick he told me, "Do you know why I worry about your sister and brother more then you?"  When I told him no he replied, "Because I know you I raised to be strong.  I know that no matter what, you will be ok because I raised you to be strong and rely on no one but yourself.  I know that at times things get hard but I know you can and will always get through it because you are my girl...And I love you more because of that."  To some people that might seem strange but to me it doesn't.  When I was younger my family always treated me different, it was like different rules applied to me.  One year before she past away I asked my grandmother why I was treated different and she told me, "Sarah, miene liebling, you are different.  We do not love you any different but we know that you grow into a woman the same rules won't apply to you as they do others.  People are mean and don't treat people equally and we want you to be prepared for what might come".  No, I'm not deformed or ugly or anything like that.  It's just that I have always been gay.  I had my first crush on another girl when I was like 9, my first girlfriend at age 13, I always knew and so did my family so they wanted me to be safe when I grew up and had to deal with ignorant people who hate me just because I love different then they do.  Well, with that all said I think I need to stop for tonight.  I have to work an open to close tomorrow and if I don't go to bed now I will never get enough rest to make it through.  Good night and be strong

       This isn't going to be my only post today, I was just thinking about a few things and wanted to jot them down some where.  As you already know I live with my bestfriend, whom I care for deeply-possibly even love.  But we are starting to grow apart and I don't like that.  We have always had a great friendship and a great sexual relationship also, but lately we have both been depressed and its affecting us.  For starters we stopped having sex..I think I miss that more then our friendship.  She doesn't think that she is good when it comes to sex but I think she is.  I'm the dominante one in the bedroom and I have tried to tell her that she is great but she going through a phase where she thinks she is fat, bad in bed, blah blah blah.  She is a spoiled brat at times and I try not to lose my temper with her but oh well, what are ya to do?  You tell me, when you want to be with someone so bad that you dream about them what do you do?  She knows how I feel but she doesn't seem to be having the same problem I am with her being stand-offish.  Oh well, I guess it's time to move on and find a new partner.  Any one interested...lol

       I guess I'm gonna use my blog like a journal...You know just let it flow.  Well, last night was strange...My roommate and I went for a walk in the park, I'm walking to try and lose some weight..I mean come on who couldn't afford not to lose some weight.  Well, I talked her into going with me.  I usually walk 3-4 laps a day but her ankle started to hurt and we had to quit after only 2 laps, so I didn't feel like I accomplished anything.  The sun was setting on our way home and the movie we wanted to see had already started, so I ended up taking a shower and trying to finish a book by John Saul I've been reading.  Boring, huh?  I know, I've gotten into a rut of sorts.  Well, any ways no matter how hard I tried every time I started to fall asleep something woke me up.  11pm the dogs whining to be let out.  12am "K" starts having chest pains and I had to go get her some aspirin and water.  I checked her pulse it was fine, she just got too hot.  That crazy girl turned her air off in her room, knowing that the temp for the night was 87 degrees and that caused her to have a night terror.  She's been having a lot of those lately.  Finally, 130am I curl up in my nice cuddly bed and start to drift off to sleep when,  the door ball starts going off. Some one/thing was holding the buzzer down.  The dogs go crazy trying to get downstairs to the door.  "K" and I have to fight past the dogs just to get to the door.  But guess what?  No one was out there.  Nothing at all.  I checked our cars, the yard, by the street.  Not a thing.  So who or what was on the buzzer.  I tell you one thing if I find out I'm gonna lay into them big time.  After all that commotion, I finally and I do mean finally got to go to sleep.  The puppy curled up in bed with me, and the other two dogs just stood guard all night.  And that was my crazy/weird night.  I know it might sound boring but like I said I'm in a sorta rut....

       Ok, this is my first blog and I just wanted to get it started.  I don't really know what to put here but I gotta start some where.  I guess I could tell you why I named it what I did.  That's a line from a movie I use to like.  The line seemed to always apply to me.  In the movie this girl was told to say,"I never did mind the little things" when ever she was about to lose her temper or was in a situation she couldn't handle but had to say something.  Ok, well I am rambling so I will stop for now but I promise that I will have much more for ya'll soon!
