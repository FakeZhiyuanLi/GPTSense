      Waking up at 2pm and finally I had a nice long sleep on the weekend.  i had been pretty busy and no time to sleep enough in the recent weeks.  i usually don't want to sleep for a long time, coz i think it's really waste of time, and i often try to either play or work until I can't really stay awake.... i really hope everyday has 48 hours, so I can have more time to do things I wanna do -- play basketball, clean up my place, work on my homework, work out, going out with lisa & kobi, hanging out with friends...etc.  i guess I am just too greedy.    I finished a japanese TV drama VCD recently.  it's called &#20116;&#23798;&#37291;&#29983;&#35386;&#30274;&#25152;. it's a show about a talented doctor, who made a medical mistake during one of his duty time, and was fired and relocated to the remote rural island far away from the japan mainland to start his own little clinic.  The heart warming, friendly story line is fine, and kind of help me to kill some time.  btw, I also use japanese drama to keep up my japanese language, at least the language side... often, i will try to listen to the conversation and not looking at the caption and try to guess / map the meaning of their conversation...  :D  From checking the internet, the actortress in that drama is really famous in Japan, &#26612;&#23822;&#24184;, she is also a famous pop star now in Japan... anyway, just something I am watching recently.  oh well, back to my home work now... the silly prof gaved a problem set which is 13 questions long...

      I found this neat website through May, my church friend, and i think this website is pretty neat and i've attempted to start a diary or a journal, but i was lazy and couldn't kept on writing to the diary... so the diary thing never worked out.    I have a good feeling this internet blog may last longer, and this would be a good update for my far-away friends -- Jason, Howan in Vancouver, Ann, Nina and Alian in Heavenbridge church, Julia in Ontario, Gugug, Sun Lein, Maggie in Taiwan, my sister in Atlanta, and my mom and dad in Tainan.  I miss you guys all very much...  :D  Recently a lot of things happened, and my life is busier but still good.  I'm a full time product engineer in LSI Logic, I feel I am doing good at work :D  I'm a part time student in SCU doing my master degree in EE, I'm a new house owner (so I live on mortgage month to month from June onwards), and I'm in a stable relationship with Lisa.    By listing what i do for everyday life, i just realize somehow my life is typical.  I need to think of something different and allow my lifestyle to be more flexible and more rewarding. :D

      Hey, never felt so good and so free about having my final exams done.  My quarter started in April and it finished with a final paper and presentation in my device physics class last Thursday.  I had a rough time prep'ing for papers and presentations since work is always busy and my relationship with Lisa is having some issues.  Losing sleep was routine for my past 2 weeks, and constantly think about NBTI (negative bias temp instability - my research topic) is filling up my little bird-size brain pretty quick.  God~ just feel very nice and finally I would have more time to play and rest.  :D  this week will not have school and I will enjoy my precious free time~

      Lisa and I had a long chat last night... She complained how not-suitable we are for each other, and I felt things are not going so well between us two.  Like many other instances, I was shut down by her impoliteness and bad attitude as the conversation carried out, and I was speechless by fast-learning how bad I am as her boyfriend and how she disliked about me not doing anything nor making any change for this relationship.  I tried to explain or express my point of views sometimes, but I was given little chances to have her just listen to me.  I have never felt so awful in any of my relationships.  The important thing is, I didn't understand why she kept mentioning things she doesn't like, but not trying to resolve some issues between us with actions.  What a rough night, and I was and am pretty lost so far in my relationship~

      i had a dream last night.  i was a soldier and i returned home from a victorious war. there is a banquet held in a beautiful ball room, and all the soldiers and their family/loved ones were there celebrating.  i saw mom, dad and sis were there.  dad was busy taking pictures for me and mom was chatting to others.  sister was hugging me and congraduating me... i alos saw howan, standing in the sea of people, and looking at and smiling at me, congradulating me.  I ran to her and gave her a big hug.  I told her how much I miss her.  I was so happy, and I thought that was the moment, the happiest moment on earth.  Last I remember dad was taking pictures for me and howan and other friends... and the dream ended.
