      Ashlee Simpson "Pieces Of Me"  On a Monday, I am waiting Tuesday, I am fading And by Wednesday, I can't sleep Then the phone rings, I hear you And the darkness is a clear view Cuz you've come to rescue me  Fall... With you, I fall so fast I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  I am moody, messy I get restless, and it's senseless How you never seem to care When I'm angry, you listen When youre happy, it's a mission And you wont stop 'til I'm there  Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast Well, I hit that bottom Crash, you're all I have  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  How do you know everything I'm about to say? Am I that obvious? And if it's written on my face... I hope it never goes away... yeah  On a Monday, I am waiting And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms... So I can breathe  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I love the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you've know me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...

      Well.. Im having a pretty good weekend.. On Friday I went home with wayne.. He got 2 new puppies.. awwww they are soo adorable.. Then Today I woke up to my phone ringing at 8 30 am.. Oh god tooo early.. lol.. It was my dad.. :( I got bitched at for a lil while.. then we got on my grades.. and then moving.. :( Well then I started to get pissed cuz he just doesnt listen to anyones opinion but his own .. and its total bullshit because hes gonna ruin my life.. I mean I have lived here all my life and he expects me to just act like I wanna move and like its not gonna bother me... and that is not gonna happen.. Well after that I went to the mall for like 10 minutes to get kimmy a present... I got her the New Found Glory CD.. and I got it too.. Then my lil bro go the Autopilot off Cd.. so yea.. it was cool.. then I went to kimmy's and swam like all day. It was fun then I went out to my grandmas house with my friend Jacob and visited people then hung out till my mom got to my grandmas.. That was fucking retarded so I walked to JD's which is like 2 minutes away .. he wasnt home but I got to drive his moms new car so it was cool.. Then I went back to my grandmas and we left.. I got Checkers on the way home!! That was seriously like the highlight of my day but when I got home it said that someone had been on my s.n in 2 other places! and the only person that haD my password was Amie.. and she must have been on in 2 diffrent places... Thats fucking stupid I mean damn how fucking stupid can you be!   Yep well .. I am getin of and gonna call wayne cuz Im bored..

      This air is contagious, no one can save us,  nothing this good could ever last,  and tonight is a drug, that I won’t give up,  this is my favorite addiction  the summer comes to a close, and no one knows what we know,  no one knowsI can’t explain, what made me stay, I fall into the same mistakes, like all good things, they never last, the past is past I’d rather be drowning, than swimming away,  that’s something that will never change,  I swallow regret, and hope for the best,  if this is all that i can dothis is why I never try, to make it seem we shouldn’t leave,  this is why I never trythis air is contagious, no one can save us, but I wait I must confess, I’m not impressed, there’s nothing worse than losing you,  I must confess, I’m not the same like all good things    All Good Things  By Counting The Stars

      Hey hey hey... Yea well.. today was fun..   I was up till like.. umm 4ish last night.. IDK I just couldnt sleep.. Well as of today.. theres no major drama except the fact that IM MOVING IN LiKE 69 DAYZ :(  Well School was.. ok I guess.. Then after school I went to the baseball game with Britt and Wayne.. that was cool..  After the game I Talked to my buddy who I havent talked to in like FOREVER.. so Im happy.. lol..  Um... yea... im kinda spacy today like I cant think about ne thing cuz I get distracted wayyyy to easily.   Yea well.. I am soo happy... IDK my life is like perfect.. except moving :( but I am trying realy hard to not let it come up in my mind because I dont wanna focus on it anymore.   Well Nate and Kelli are gonna get married in December! and I get to be in the wedding! YaY so I'll be heading up there for a lil bit during christmas break unless they decide to do it down here at the breakers... I am soo happy for them because I kno how much I cried when I found out about his cancer but her.. I mean I couldnt imagine being with sum1 for 3 years then one day outta the blue finding out they have cancer :( I wouldnt be able to live. One of the hardest things about it is that Nate JUST Turned 17 Like April 10th.  If sumthin goes wrong IDK wut I will do... I mean we arent like brother n sister like me n Bryan but we are pretty close. Wow.. I just think about wut I would do if I found out Wayne had cancer *knocks on wood*.. WHOA.. I wouldnt be able to live...   Yep well.. I still have yet to do the dishes :x Lol.. So Im gonna do sum homework then do them..   Love Yaz!

      Yea well.. Today I watched movies ALL day in school.. I cant believe its already the last week... IDK wut I am gonna do this summer.. I dont wanna move at all.. but I dont think I will have a choice but I told my dad moving is going to ruin my life.. :( I feel bad because I dont think theres anything he can do u kno? but everyones giving him a really hard time about it but I dont wanna leave WAYNE.. or my friends.. :-( Oh well.. I guess I just have to go with the Flow.. even though I kno if I dont put up a fight then he wont even think about staying here..   Well.... I had the Best weekend.. It was awesome.. I am scared tho... cuz I have fallen so in Love with Wayne.. and I might be leaving him in only a few months.. The more I try not to think about it .. The more I think about not thinking about it and end up thinking about it.. lol.. (did that make sense?)  Um.. Lets see the new drama in my life right now would be moving... and JD bitching at me. He thinks I am being unfair and I am ditching him for my boyfriend...Im not denying it because I am but he wont leave it alone.. he keeps saying how fucked up that is but in all honesty.. he would/did do the same thing to me and I didnt say shit to him because I knew how much he loved the person he was ditching me for.  I cant believe how awesome this weekend was.. Friday was the perfect day! Me n Wayne hung out .. and So many things happened.. I cant believe how perfect it was. Then Saturday wayne met my dad for the first time.. wow.. that was scary lol.. but I think my dad was impressed so Im happy..   Well.. Im out cuz I have to do the dishes.. Yay :/ lol..
