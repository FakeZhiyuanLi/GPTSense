      There are days in your life when you sit and wonder how you got to where you are.  I'm not talking about one specific thing... I'm referring to the grand scheme of life.  In an effort to reorganize my room before the invasion occurs, I decided to put all of my photos into albums.  (True, it isn't the biggest priority right now, but I thought it would be the most fun).  And, it just got me thinking about how things have changed.  So, while I was sitting in front of my laptop watching Big Fish (since, true to my narcoleptic self I fell asleep watching it first time around), I sorted through about three years worth of photos-- family, childhood friends, high school friends, college friends, co-workers, etc.  Sorting them chronologically, it was so interesting to see how one's life is defined by the people around them (and I won't go into how fitting it was to be watching Big Fish as this happened).    I don't know where I'm going with this... except to say that I'm grateful for every person in those pictures who managed to put a smile on my face, for every memory, for every time that someone was willing to lend an ear.  Throughout life, we all end up making life-altering decisions.  A lot of times, you end up in the place you least expected to be.  You wake up not really certain about why you are where you are; yet, when you think about it, you can't imagine yourself anywhere else.  You find that the things that you thought would make you happy don't seem to cut it anymore, and those things that you took for granted all along are the things that you really need.  You find that happiness isn't a tangible goal, it's something that simply comes and goes through life.  You learn that the tears are as important as the laughter, and may actually be more so.  You find that the uncertain is the only thing that is certain, and you embrace it.  You learn to let go-- let go of the fear, the anger, the dread, the sadness, the worries, the nightmares.  You learn to just breathe.  And you learn all this while spending time with your friends and family.  It's the memories that are etched into our heart that help us learn all of these things.  Life isn't defined by the key decisions that you make on your path.  What's really important are the little things that shape you along the way.  SATC Quote of the Day: "They say life's what happens when you're busy making other plans. But sometimes, life is what happens when you're waiting for a table."  And this one goes out to my choco-holic: Water Consumption: A lot Food Consumption: Went a bit overboard.  Shall do better tomorrow (only because of the promise of chocolate in a few days) Exercise: 30 min cardio, 1 hour Pilates... yeah man.

      I never thought I'd say this, but thank God for Pataki.  I have tomorrow off.  Yippee.  Long weekend ahead... hehehe.  Anyways, here we go.  Same breakfast (eggs, cereal bar, coffee).  Steamed veggie spring roll and leftover triple bean salad for lunch.  Some weird-ass muffin that I haven't been able to identify yet.  A plum, honeydew, strawberries and blueberries.  One Entennman's cookie.  Ham sandwich for dinner, okra on the side (don't ask).  Same fro yo for dessert.        Oh, and lots of water.  Exercise: 30 min cardio, 1 hour excrutiatingly painful Pilates class (I didn't think I could get my body to bend like that!!)  Ok bedtime.

      Achievements for the day:   a) finished my big work project   b) fit into my skinny pants   c) bought myself a new Burberry to celebrate   d) managed to study on the subway   e) got a raise   f) fell in love with Kate Hudson all over again   Went to see Raising Helen today.  Before I continue, I should note that I really don't like most sappy romantic comedies, but this one was really cute (probably because it wasn't terribly sappy).  I recommend watching it, when you get a chance.  But, more than anything else, i couldn't get over how damn beautiful Kate Hudson is... and John Corbett (who will forever in my eyes be seen as Aidan) was just the sweetest.  Me like lots.  Yes, if I were a guy, or a lesbian, I would be totally obsessed with her.  Anybody know who I can pay to get my hair looking like that ("that" being the curls, not the blondeness).  I'll pay good money for it...  Speaking of Kate, if you haven't seen Almost Famous, go see it.  Everytime I see it, I appreciate it more and more.  It's the ultimate fantasy fulfilled (no nothing dirty)... but simply following your passion, being surrounded by the things you love, and growing because of it (I guess it struck a special chord because of my similar fanatical love for music when I was william's age...).  But yeah... William Miller and Penny Lane go down as two of the best movie characters ever.  Anyways, enough rambling.  Time for my food log. More or less, the same as yesterday, until the end of the night.  Scrambles egg yolk substitute, glass of water, Special K cereal bar, small hazelnut coffee, 1 Effexor cookie, 1 Entennman's cookie, Ham sandwich on wheat bread (turkey ham, not the haram stuff), mango,  2 bottles of Poland Spring, triple bean salad, nescafe, 1 piece of spinach ravioli (taken from Farhana's meal), one mozarella stick (from Nahrin's meal), Nescafe, and 1/3 of a slice of Hazelnut Chocolate Cake (I couldn't help myself!!!)... shall go back to strict diet tomorrow.

      Second post of the day... I'm on a roll...  So, a friend and I (I'll stick to proper grammar) decided that, in true Bridget Jones's form, we would maintain a log of our daily consumption in an effort to perfect ourselves into true goddesses.  Here we go.  Tuesday, June 8 2004  Liquids: 3 bottles of Poland Spring, one small cup of coffee with skim milk and 2 Equals, one bottle of Snapple Diet Lime Green Tea (half of which was snorted up my nose when Lucy attempted to kill me... see footnote below), and 4 additional glasses of water.  Solids:  Scrambled egg yolk substitute (cholesterol and fat-free) with mushrooms and ketchup, one Special K cereal bar (strawberry flavored), 3 Entennman's chocolate chip cookies, turkey sandwich on toasted rye bread with light mayo, salted cashews, 2 Effexor chocolate chip cookies (aka, "happy cookies", see footnote below), for dinner-- 1/2 cup rice, cauliflower, one piece of chicken and daal; 2 scoops of Heath Nut Toffee swirl frozen yogurt, and one Russell Stover Sugar-Free milk chocolate truffle.  Ciggies: None, as long as second-hand doesn't count.   Music: Madonna, in preparation for concert next week.  Must memorize all lyrics.    Exercise: 20 minutes on Stairmaster, followed by 1 hour of Boot Camp... am in intense pain... muscles that I didn't know I had are aching...am worried that will not be able to move at all tomorrow.  Considering giving body a break tomorrow.  Footnote Number One- The Snapple incident So, I've been trying to contact a co-author on one of Maria's papers for about a week.  He's in Spain and is Spanish-speaking only.  I write him a kind yet forceful email today asking him to Puh-lease send me back the things I sent him.  I asked Lucy to do a quick grammar check since my written Spanish is kinda rusty.  She started to read it in a totally thick American accent, as I was taking a sip of my Snapple.  I lunged at  my garbage can so that the snapple I coughed up would fall in there.  However, the Snapple also came up my nose... and I'm almost certain through my eye sockets as well.  My throat, nose and eyes were sore for quite some time.  Footnote Number Two- The Effexor Cookies Please note the that "happy cookies" do not actually have any form of antidepressant in them (or so say the pharmaceutical reps who give them to us on a weekly basis.)  They are, however, given to us by the company that provides us with Effexor, hence the name Effexor cookies.  In the upcoming weeks, since we do work in a research facility, we plan to conduct a study to see if Effexor cookie intake has any effect on mood.  We are starting to think that they are indeed happy-pills (as evidenced by fits of laughter following consumption).  (I guess they're just a notch above Lithium laced ice cream).  Goals for the next week: Reduce cookie intake.  Increase water intake.

      Any fashionista can tell you that the way you dress affects your mood.  You dress in sweats, you'll feel like a bum... there's no arguing it.  Yesterday, I was in need of a miracle outfit, one that could help me recover from my non-stop weekend (when are my weekends not non-stop I wonder), and that would make me functional for my Monday morning.  I stood in front of my closet for a good 15 minutes just staring...   For those of you who haven't been to my room, I take pride in my perfectly organized closet (the rest of my room can be an absolute disaster, but my closet must ALWAYS be perfect).  Yes, it's very Monica Geller-Bing, but I can't help myself.  I've got a shoe rack on my door that holds 32 pairs of shoes (the ones that I use most often, not including boots).  I bought these cubbyhole-type racks to maximize closet space, and each shelf is very specific to a type of clothing (solid button downs, printed button downs, other knits, solid slacks, other slacks, "funky"-but-still-work-worthy tops, formal skirts, work skirts, casual skirts, wool skirts... you get the idea).  One one side of the racks, I have my blazers and sweater coats, and on the other, I have my sweatshirts.  (No, that's not all of my clothes, but that's what's in my closet).  Anyway, I digress, yet again.  The point is, I'm sitting there staring at my closet and I can't find a thing to wear.  Finally, a top at the bottom of my solid button downs caught my eye- a baby blue Banana Republic shirt that I had bought years ago and totally loved, but for some bizarre reason had only worn twice.  Matched 'em with grey slacks and cute strappy sandals (to show off my French pedicure), packed my handbag and I was ready to go.  The "professional" outfit made me feel ready to conquer the Monday and whatever it had to bring.    I strolled into work at 8:45 on a total high and the first thing I saw was an e-mail from the Man (aka, my boss's boss).  Fuck, that's NEVER a good thing.  Apparently something that was supposed to be taken care of on Friday (while I was out "sick" watching the first showing of HP3) had not been done.  Fuckity fuck fuck fuck.  So I quickly take care of things and send him a reply "Dear Dr. X, Please note that the situation has been taken care of.  Sorry about that"... totally realizing that he will bring this up countless times in the future.  Not the best way to start your Monday, Sad.  Anyways, day progresses at a rapid pace.  One patient after another.  Everything's an emergency.  Same old stuff that goes on everyday.  Sometime after lunch, the Russian came into my office.  Before I go on, I should describe the Russian, because he's NOTHING like Carrie's Russian, who was quite sexy given his age.  This Russian is 5'8", round, slightly balding psychiatrist with a THICK Russian accent and a penchant for the word "basically."    But unlike when you or I say "basically", he actually pronounces each syllable so it comes out sounding like "Be-see-cah-ly".  He always dresses in white or cream button-down shirts (long in the winter, short in the summer) and bland ties.  He paces down the hallway with one hand folded behind his back and the other swinging at his side at such a slow pace that it seems like he's counting each step.  Anyways, you get the idea.  Not the coolest of dudes.  So, in the middle of our conversation about chocolate-chip-cookie-diets, he stops, looks straight at "me", (but not at my face mind you) and goes "That is a lovely shirt you're wearing." I reply, "Umm thanks" and immediately wonder if my top is too tight (which I ultimately decided it was not). And then, the Russian goes, "No, really.  It is a very nice top.  I am not just saying to be nice.  It is a very lovely top." (yes, no contractions used) I quickly cross my arms and say thanks again to the Russian and try as quickly as I can to kick the Russian out of the room.  When I reported the incident to Lucy, my co-worker, she laughed and said "You know all that he was saying was your tits look good in that top." How lovely... I'm Bridget Jones without Hugh Grant.  I'm stuck getting hit on by old Russian doctors... can life get any better (words dripping with sarcasm)?  I repeated the story to Pia (who officially holds the title of "Queen of all things related to Bridget Jones")  Her prompt response was "lol... how Titspervert to Brenda..." Lovely.  I just can't win.  Sigh, what's a girl to do?

      Even if relationships, work responsibilities, or your finances are causing sleepless nights, try to put your mind at rest.  Once you stop expecting the worst, your life will (eventually) fall perfectly into place.  You're holding an astrological winner's ticket promising success and fulfillment, but it will take time and patience before you collect on it.  Don't lost heart-- instead lose some weight on your shoulders.

      So, everywhere I go, I see people blogg-ing.  And hard as I tried to resist, I find myself getting sucked in as well.    Here's one of my fave SATC quotes:  Carrie: Maybe I can't leave New York. I don't know how I'd do someplace else. Samantha: Believe me, your fabulousness would translate.  So yesterday, as I discussed my plight with JN, she said something that was eerily similar to Samantha's quote.  In fact, she continued to talk about my fabulousness as we followed our waiter up the stairs to our table at Cosi's.  (I noted, however, that the waiter couldn't help but smirk, but I digress.)  My response to JN's ramblings was "Fabulous?!  Sure... whatever.  I am FAR from fabulous."  But, it got me thinking.  We look at the ppl around us and are always in awe of their fabulousness.  I can say, without a moment's hesitation, that each of my friends is 100% fabulous.  I've been known to say "If you're my friend, you are by default fabulous because I only hang out with fabulous ppl."  And it's true.  Every single one of them is unique, special and most importantly, incredibly strong.  They may be going through ups or downs right now, but that fabulousness does not fade.  Yet, when their fabulousness is pointed out to them, they quickly do everything possible to deny it.  I'm guilty of doing the same.  Why is it that we can't see ourselves the way others view us?  When will FABULOUS take it's rightful place in our vocabulary?  I mean seriously... why are we women so damn unsure of ourselves?  What causes us to question every single move we make?  Why do we have these lingering feelings of self-doubt?  Why is it so hard to make a decision and stick to it?  Why is it that when a woman takes a stand, she's labelled a bitch.  Even worse, why is she the first to call herself a bitch?    Sometimes the decisions we make in life may not be the healthiest ones for us, or even the most practical ones.  But at the end of the day, we have no choice but to follow our hearts down the path that feels the most right while never forgetting that, no matter what, we're fucking fabulous.
