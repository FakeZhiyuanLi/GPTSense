      Interpretations below:  Chapter I. Priorities in your life: pride family money love career  Chapter II. You would describe your own personality as being cute You would describe your partner's personality as being annoying You would describe your enemy's personality as being digusting You interpret sex as being yummy You would describe your own life as being calming  Chapter III. Alden will never forget you. You consider Janice as your real friend. You really love Richie. Your soul-mate is probably Mom. You will always remember Ian for the rest of your life.

      ahh yes... yanno, i really miss talking to Richie... is he still on lockdown(i wonder)... what makes me miss me tho? no dur, he's my babe... but why did i fall for him??i've never really stated what it is that makes me go gaa-gaa over Richie... so imma just put it right here.. is it because he's the deepest, most sweetest guy to me? or is it becuase he has a 6 pac?? haha... i love the way he rhymes and flows his words.. i love the way he's always there to listen to me vent, even tho he sumtimes forces it upon me... i love his style and how he's gangstar! j/k... i love the way his lips are so full... haha... i love he sings... let's face it... the by is perfect! well... no one's perfect, and yes he has his flaws... like how he went on hitting on nina when she already went out with john.. and eric.. dude, i thought those two were his boys... and how he is so FRREAKING stubborn, geezus, no getting through that kid, but i still love him... and did i mention how he's 6 hrs and 38 minutes away or 349.36 miles give or take a few... and how i can't hug him like REGULAR people do... i'm not saying he's not there for me, cuz he is... i'm just saying it's just not fair for two ppl who love each other to be separated as such... -sigh-... at least i see him in my dreams..*muah*

      Love Calculator results These are the results of the calculations by Dr. Love: Richie Santos    Aubriel Rivera        27 %       The chance of a relationship working out between Richie Santos and Aubriel Rivera is not very big, but a relationship is very well possible, if the two of you really want it to, and are prepared to make some sacrifices for it. You'll have to spend a lot of quality time together. You must be aware of the fact that this relationship might not work out at all, no matter how much time you invest in it.

PLUS MORE! dude, the boy is amazing... and it's so sad... that he doesn't know that i think he's just an angel... i love you Richie... but i denno about this whole "couple thing" maybe it's better off we stay "just friends"....  i gotta let it burn...    here i am again, wondering if your ok// can't stop this troubled heart, cuz we're miles away... wish you were here, holding me

      Dearest  Richie ,  Ha... stealing pictures from my ading now are we o.0? I saw that picture of you all  gangsta  and whatnot and I was thinking,  "So this is the guy that's favorite movie is Cinderella?"  I'm dumb. Yea, that's me! Your one and only dumb Yet darling babygirl =] . Anyways...     Happy 3rd Month anniversary     Three  months and I'm still madly, crazy, deeply, head over heels in love with you like I always have been in the beginning. Thank you for always being there (in thoughts of course =P) and caring so much about me. You're the  best   thing  going right in my life and I thnk  God  everyday for allowing me to have is one most precious gift...  your   love . I never really knew what love was until you came along wanting to  "make new friends".  Ha. There is not one imperfection about&nbsp;you that I could think of &amp; I'm always wondering what did I&nbsp;do to&nbsp;deserve someone like you. Yea, we had some hard times like the rents, not talking, and the distance, but   hey  ... together we somehow&nbsp;put up with that shit and got through those obstacles. Again, thank you for always being the sweet, loving  boyfriend  that you are yo me. I'll never forget you, nor can I imagine myself forgetting you.    I love you Richie&nbsp;and I never will stop loving you.   &nbsp;&nbsp;
