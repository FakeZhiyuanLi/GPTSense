      It's been a rough couple of days. The weight of the world is upon me and I don't know if I can bear the weight.  Is it harder to leave or be the one left behind? For once I would like to be on the other side.

      My mind is in that place we all want to be at almost 3 AM. What a night!  Euphoria is having the open road to yourself. Being the only person in one county that is awake.   Tomorrow I will pay the price for tonight. I will worry about that tomorrow...

      It's Saturday morning and I am just waking up. I am already tired because I know I will be busy all weekend long.  Another frustrating day at work yesterday. I can't get this code to thru and it is making crazy.   Date with Greg last night. We had Thai for dinner and he took me by his place to watch Sea Biscuit. Cute movie. Cute little horse. Greg scored big points with me last night. He is into art and has his work up around his house. Normally that might bother me but his stuff is tasteful. He also has a collection of photos that his grandfather has taken from around the world up in one room. Stunning. That's really all I can say. Greg has his shit together. He has a black cat. The last guy that I was crazy about had a black cat.  Tonight I am going out with the girls. We are having Sushi for dinner and then will make plans for the rest of the night. It's time for some girl time!! I haven't been out with the girls in a few weeks now and I am ready to go and get lit.  Archie is coming tomorrow to get some work done on this side project. It's wet today so I will be early working the lawn before he gets here.  Always too much to do.... I am going back to bed.

      I have been in a hazy funk far too long. Like you feel when you first wake up in the morning and your eyes haven't adjusted to the reality of the day.  I had lunch with Ernie and Greg. Ernie told me he will miss hugging me and the smell of my hair. I will miss everything about him. Great friends are so hard to find. He sent me his latest story today. I hope he makes it one day. He is as good as any writer I have read.  Greg said he would take me to Seattle. Now, that is an interesting offer. I don't know about Greg. I know he likes me. Our friends seem to think we should make a go of it. He has a good head on his shoulders and I know he would never hurt me. Maybe I shouldn't be so lofty about love and just give in. Perhaps loving is a process that one can learn.   My sister is coming July 4th weekend!! Yay! I can't wait. I have plans for the whole weekend. I hope it rocks!!  My head is still buzzing from work. The effects of being a code whore. I have to work on my side project this weekend. Archie has found some time. Imagine.  Enough - I'm numb.

      About 24 hours ago you contacted me. It blew me away in every sense of the word. I was in euphoria. Somewhere between partially dreaming and partially awake. I have thought about you everyday since we last talked. You have the strangest effect on me...  I'm stuck in time. You sitting on my couch with me lying across your lap. Your hands were on me. My eyes were closed I was taking in your voice. We had someplace to be but if I had known what was to come I would have stayed and made the most every minute of my time with you. If I close my eyes I can go back there to that night.   You said you have been dreaming about me. I dream about you too. It's a yearning really. I'm not sure why you wanted to tell me. You said you were doing ok. You didn't offer anything else and I didn't ask anymore.  Are you still sure you made the right decision? I am angry at myself for walking away that day. I was scared and I didn't know what else to do. It was defense. Are you happy now?   I didn't see it then but I do clearly now. You are my soul mate. You are "the one" I did not then and I let the opportunity pass. The other half of me will roam the earth trying to figure out how I let you go until the end of time...

      It's Sunday and my life is changing before my eyes again. It's quite normal for people to pass right thru my life. I've learned to make the most of the time I have with people because of this.  I've spend most of the day reflecting on the past year and thinking about what I really want to do going forward. What do I want for myself? That is a hard question. Being selfish is hard.  I guess all that I want today is to get thru the latest round of change.   I feel like traveling..... to someplace far away.

      I'm hooked on Melissa Auf Der Maur's 'Followed The Waves'. I just can't seem to get enough of that song. Maybe it's time for me to shuffle someone's deck clean...  So many things spinning in my head today that I can't seem to get a grip on any of them to verbalize it.   I cried last night. Sometimes it helps to cry. My best friend is still moving away. I may cry everyday until he is gone.  I have to send myself emails to remind me of things. Like "send your dad his father's day card". I can't remember a damn thing anymore.  The world is vampire....

      Removed myself from American Singles. The online dating scene is a drag. I refuse to be plucked from the aisles of singleness like a piece of fruit in the super market.  I want something bigger for myself. I want a true love not a superficial computer attraction. I want human interaction not IM interaction. The whole experience of online dating leaves me feeling empty.  I'm content - now I am going to bed.

      My best friend is moving away. I went to his going away party today. What a bummer...  I ran 3 miles.   A guy named 4 lizards contacted me today. He has a tattoo of four lizards on his wrist.   I am still looking for my John Wayne. Where is my prairie son?  In my CD player today I listened to Nirvana. I need more romance in my life.... Do men still try to win women's hearts? Do men know how to win a woman's a heart?  I will watch David Chappelle tonight on CC. He cracks me up. :)

      Lately I've been having the time of my life. It always confuses me&nbsp;when I seem to be happy.&nbsp; Last Saturday I went to Charleston. I had&nbsp;arranged a surprise bridal party for my sister. I hired a couple of male strippers. What can I say except - HOT!! Best bling I ever spent.&nbsp; She had a great time and everyone at the party had a great time. I am thankful to have a sister.  Greg and I are moving forward in this "relationship". We've both been kind of slow about it but I can feel that things are picking up between us. The stress of our jobs takes its toll though. I don't know of many relationships that can endure that.   We played tennis last Sunday night. In return I promised to learn to play eq. We'll see how this goes. It's something that he enjoys and he did try to play tennis so I will try. We've got a big weekend planned. I am looking forward to it. He was out of town last week so I am enjoying having him around again...  Feels like the real thing - could it be?  &nbsp;

      Whew - crazy days.... &nbsp; Ernie and his family made their way safely to Dallas. Good friends that are sorely missed. &nbsp; I'm about to bring my project in. Tired of working 10 hour days. Tired of the stress.... &nbsp; Well, Greg and I have been at it for about a month now. Things are going well but I have never been a great judge of such things. I like being treated well though. It makes me feel human.... &nbsp; Reading some Depth and off to bed.

      Well, Ernie is on his way to Dallas, Texas tomorrow. I cried despite my best efforts not to. I am such a girl sometimes. I know this move is the best thing for him and his family. What I feel is pure selfishness.  Greg called me tonight. He wants to spend some time with me this weekend. He said he would take a look at what is going on in the attic. That's sweet. He took me to a cafe for dinner Tuesday night. It was very charming. He planned the whole thing out. He warms me. It's strange.   Tomorrow my sister is coming!! YIIIIPPPEEE!!! I will make Mexican and watermelon margaritas!! A visit from Debbie ALWAYS cheers me up. It's good to have a sister.  I am making progress with my project. Finally. I can breathe. Archie is coming to pick-up the side project Monday. I will be glad to see that thing gone. If I pick-up anymore side work I need a good kick in the ass.  To bed - plenty to do but need to sleep now...

      The end of summer is nearing. Soon it will be fall. The days are spent so quickly. Things are settling down. I enjoy a consistent flow of nothingness.  Everything seems to be in it's place. For the first time in a really long time I am at peace with myself and my existence. All is well with my soul.
