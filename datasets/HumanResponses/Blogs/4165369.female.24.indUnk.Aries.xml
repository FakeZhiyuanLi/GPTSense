      Hi guys,  Well suppose its not really the point of a blog to have just a random group-mail type entry, but perhaps as time goes on I will find something of greater relevance to vent spleen about (other than with the blatant intention of familiarising myself a little bit with random other google products).  Work’s going well and I’m enjoying it very much, though still on a really steep learning curve. It’s not that difficult to get motivated or up in the morning so far thankfully and I’m genuinely getting a kick out of all the Ping-Pong… there’s so much weird and wonderful stuff out there, and only some of it can be legitimately axed because of dodgy content. My porn-related has also grown by about 1000000%. (admittedly, growing from a low statistical base on that one!).  Mr. Wilkinson’s adventures and escapades have kept me entertained over the past couple of days; much madness on that front. He’s well after his Zambia-aufenthalt, and life continues, reverting to a slower pace at the hands of the advent of a 9-6 but the arrival of cable television into my life has buffered the blow somewhat! He has a site up now at www.geocities.com/goniconline/ (if you haven’t read the Cuthbert story series before then I’ve been asked to disclaim that this is all of course in jest and not to be taken that seriously; ditto for the trinity photos)… Caroline stars in another fine cameo!  Other than that there’s really not much else up. The O’Malleys are all well. Grace’s german exchange is coming on Monday for three months so I’ll be spending the weekend packing my room into boxes. Grrrr. I’m still on the look for any punters wanting to go to Mor next weekend, more info at: www.morfestival.com. Any takers at all or even vague interest let me know… it genuinely looks like it will rock, even one taker would do. Beginning to think i mightn’t make it,.. never mind, there’s a few other things coming up..  Hope this finds you all well, Best wishes, s;)

       urlLink  300 Creative Dates - The World's Most Romantic, Unique and Fun Dating Ideas   I'm beginning to seriously consider the possibility that this hatted-gent may be none other than TCD's own Lektor Thomas M... Perhaps this is how he funds all that exotic travel? ;)

      Hello there, So,  I'm not entirely sure about my motivation for signing up for this blog. Time will tell as to whether it's ever used! Training has finished and I'm very tired indeed. Best wishes out there to blogland, Suz;)
