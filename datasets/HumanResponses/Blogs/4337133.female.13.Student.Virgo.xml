      Hey, everyone... if you got to this blog, it means you probably know who I am... you should. Well, if you don't, here goes: my name is Noelle Filoteo. I am a first-year student at Colegio San Agustin Makati (IA gurl)././././././. Okay. So, thanks for getting here. If you don't find my blog particularly interesting... well *shrugs*. Anyway, since this is the very first post, I may as well talk about what I want to talk about...  Soccer. I am definitely and wholly addicted to it, but sometimes I just want to quit. If you know what I mean, varsity players... and now the noose of Report Cards is tightening around my neck.   GRADES. Now that it's the second quarter I need to improve them.  Richmond Fernandez... shame on you if you're reading this and you don't know who he is...  Friends... best friends...  Sibling problems... sometimes I just damn want to kill her!  Colegio San Agustin... home of the Koreans... no sense of respect...  Til' the next post... have to stop here, anyway. Promise to keep this more interesting.  *!^Noelle^!*

      Richmond Fernandez... okay, those who hate me gushing, please skip this post. Richmond, I met him, like two years ago. I'm in love. God. Yeah, never realized it. I know I tend to mistake infatuation for love. Like the time with Charles Dalida (who's weirdly now my PEN PAL. From first infatuation to pen pal. Ironic.), Florante (okay... no one laugh!), and Angelo Chu(those who've noticed I tend to look for him in the crowd, it's merely out of habit.REALLY.)  Now that IA keeps pairing Michael and I up (PUBLIC DENIAL: I AM NOT CRUSHING ON ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS... UH, THAT'S SICK!!!), I can gush all I want. Anyway, Michael, I'm sorry for being so taray to you. Sorry. You know that feeling when you think of your love (yeah, just THINK, not see) you get the urge to smile? I'm hell smiling right now, thinking of HIM. Richmond. Capital of Virginia. But anyway, I admire him for his soccer talent. God, if you could see this guy... REALLY ANNOYING, AT THE SAME TIME IMPRESSIVE. When he juggles the ball, you absolutely cannot steal it from him. It's so annoying.   The fact that he's handsome helps to somewhat alleviate the soccer thing annoyance. Also, he's so courteous and polite... and nice... even to my annoying cousin (I love him, but come on, the little guy could really frazzle your nerves when he wants to). I don't care that I don't see him that much. Also, he's easy to talk to, and he's willing to listen. Very easygoing, but he's also kinda shy. It's so adorable! sleepy-head! He loves sleeping, and usually he's alone, or with his best friend Bryan. He's older than me. (What can I say, he's in college!) But you know what I really love about him? He's humble...  And he's so funny!  The saying "funny guys get the girl" deems true for my case. GOD! I love the guy!  *^!Noelle!^*  P.S. I refuse to forgive Shaira Bello for stealing my column title (copyright is MINE!) and writing a suck-up article, using MY COLUMN NAME! It would be better if she didn't use "Through Rose-Colored Glasses". Now that article bears my column name! "1,650 Years in the Making"... Damn!  "I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak, I lose all control, and something takes over me, in the day, you look so amazing, it's not a phase, I want you to stay with me, by my side, I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet, and it knocks me right off of my feet... I can't explain why your  loving makes me weak..."
