      so, as you are all aware, we went to play trivia last night at the Raven.  Well, there WAS NO TRIVIA!!!!  So pissed off.  The waitress explained to us that since the Yankees were playing the Red Sox, the trivia guy wouldn't be able to use the microphone as that would disrupt the commentary of the game on the TV.  Two things are wrong with this statement:   1) They knew the Red Sox were playing the Yankees LAST week when we were there, yet there was no mention then of there being no trivia.  In fact, the guy made a huge point about inviting us all back next week for more trivia.  It was a ploy to get us to go back.    2) They weren't even playing the TV commentary!!!  They played loud music the WHOLE time, so what the hell are they talking about?    Makes absolutely no sense and I am pissed.  I mean, my Dad drove down from New Hampshire for trivia.  So he was not happy either.  Fuckers, fuckers.    Well, we did have a good time anyway.  So there's that.  Also - Joel, I believe I saw your friend Rich(?) while I was there.  You know, the guy from Bentley that I never liked.  He is still a COMPLETE asshole, evidenced by the fact that he kept staring and staring at me, and I finally said hi, and he didn't respond at all.  what a jerk, I always hated him.

      Tonight we are all heading back over to the Raven for more trivia!!!!  We have a title to defend here, people.  This is some serious shit.  I hope that I will be able to answer one question tonight, as I did last week.  That's enough for me.    Joel has been terribly upset about the course of events this concert season is taking.  First lollapalooza is cancelled, then the Pixies are dicking him around.  Poor guy.  But honestly, what do I care, I'm going to see the Dead on July 31st.  That's enough for me.    Women who wear flip flops with a suit should be shot.  I volunteer for the job.  Is anyone an expert on dog shit?  Audrey seems to be having a slew of problems, with no end in sight.  It's either too hard or too soft, going too often or not going at all.  I think Joelle is secretly poisoning her, maybe with arsenic, Flowers in the Attic style.  Incest is next perhaps.

                Once upon a time there was a man who was walking down a cold, dark lonely road. In the middle of that road lay a very large snake, which suddenly turned his head and began to speak!            "Help me, Mister!" the snake said, "Please help me!  I'm a cold-blooded reptile and without warmth and nourishment, I'll die on this cold, lonely road.  Please pick me up and put me under your coat so that I might warm myself."            "But you're a poisonous snake," the man said.  "And if I pick you up, you'll surely bite me."            "I wouldn't bite you if you saved my life," the snake told him.  "I'd be very grateful."            The man thought for a moment, then reached down, picked up the snake and put him inside his coat.  And when the snake had warmed himself and vitality returned, he suddenly struck out and bit the man.            Ripping open his coat, the man hurled the snake back down on the cold pavement.  "Why did you do that?" he demanded.  "You said if I saved your life, you wouldn't bite me!"            The snake, with a sneer on his face, looked up and the man and said, "Mister, I'm a snake.  You knew what I was when you picked me up!"

      First off - pet peeve # 2,847,373:      People who get on an elevator, see that the button to the floor they want to go to is already pressed, and then go ahead and press it again anyway, even if it means they have to push people out of the way to do it.  To those people I send out a big fuck you.    Audrey had all sorts of runny shit coming out of her ass this morning.  Nice, huh?  I was late for work because I had to boil her up some chicken and rice and practically spoon feed her because she doesn't know that people food is actually food that she can eat.  She thought it was a toy or something.  Kept chewing it up and spitting it out.  And of course, Joel cannot clean up the messes because he pukes on top of it, creating even more of a mess.  Men are such pansies.  I mean, it's only shit.    Last night I was at Circuit City picking up a little something for a certain Polak I know.  Well, did you know that if you sign up for a Circuit City credit card you can get a free two liter of soda!!!! Imagine that!  Put yourself and your credit record at the mercy of those deranged facists and get a $1 bottle of soda absolutely free!  I know a deal when I see one people.  You better get your asses down there quick.

      Dear Joel,  My goodness.  Song lyrics for your first post?  Aren't you the one who is ALWAYS making fun of my penchant for song lyrics?  Yet again, I am faced with the undeniable fact that you are a huge, bowl-legged hypocrite.  You are a smoker who complains about second hand smoke.  'Nuff said.  But alas, Modest Mouse does rock my anemic little world.  So I guess I shouldn't be so hard on you.  Nah, I will be that hard on you.  I just can't help it.

      For father's day, I took my dad to trivia night at the Raven in Waltham along with the usual suspects.  It was fucking ruling.  We kicked so much ass, we set a record for highest score ever.  I think we only got 4 questions out of 30 wrong.  Well, by "we" I mean everyone else sitting at the table.  For those of you who don't know, I SUCK at trivia.  really horribly.  But I do enjoy playing and writing down the answers in my type-writer like handwriting.  The only answer I contributed was that Mickey Mouse turned 75 years old last year.  So sad, so sad.  We got a free round of watermelon martinis plus 30 bucks in cash for winning.  Rock.  Didn't get home til almost 3:00 though, but I am surprisingly not too tired.    Back to work for a while.  Aimee, you should post on your blog more often.  Your entries are way funnier than mine.

      Joel seems to have a problem with putting things in perspective, as evidenced by this recent e-mail:  "fucking lollapalooza has been cancelled.  I'm so pissed.  All dates have been cancelled, it's the entire tour.  This was the only thing I was looking forward to.  This is going to set off a downward spiral in my life that I will never recover from."

      Just as I was pushing 'publish post' on my last entry, I looked up from my desk to see a figure dancing in the window.  Wouldn't you know, it was Joel.  Apparently he woke up, got on his bike, and rode all the way down here just for kicks, and decided to surprise me by dancing in front of my office window.  I told you today was weird.

      The entire world has stayed home from work today.  Well, enough people so that it seems weird to me.  Let's start with Joel.  Since he's the craziest and most bowl-legged man-child out there, it's a good place to start.    Yesterday, Joel and I went over to his parents house for a little Father's Day feel-good fun.  And it was.  After dessert, we all had one cup of coffee.  It was around 6:00 pm.  I thought nothing of it.  But it just so happens that Joel is a total freak, and that one little tiny cup of coffee kept him up ALL NIGHT.  He's like an old man.  He was still awake when I left for work this morning.  And I'm not talking about "stayed up too late watching TV and couldn't stop" type of awake.  He was laying in bed with his eyes closed all friggin' night and didn't sleep for even one moment.  The boredom alone would kill me.  Why didn't he just get up?  Fucking insomnia amateur.  So, he decided to call in sick to work today, go figure.  Well, I do have to say that he NEVER calls in sick, so I guess he deserves to have a day off.    Patricia is also home today.  As she put it, Spencer must sprinkle a delicate mixture of pollen, dust and cat dander in her eyes while she's sleeping.  Yes, her allergies are that bad.  And yes, he is evil enough to do something like that.  This is the same guy who got drunk one night and called me fat about 100 times while physically assaulting me.  I was just trying to driving his drunk ass home, see the thanks I get.    Michael Sherman is also out today, which came as a shock.  I love Michael Sherman.  Work just isn't the same without him.  I'm also covered in bug bites, because Joel and his father made me go on a "walkabout" (yes they actually called it that, those nerds.  It's definitely a genetic thing in that family) with them through the woods in Townsend yesterday.

      Ok, before the women of the world get out of control with their bitching about frizzy hair in the summertime, let's just take a moment to remember something - at least they  have  hair.   I would like nothing more than to try to tame a massive bush of free flowing, out of control clumps of hair.  Every morning, as I patiently preen the 5 strands that are left on my head, I think, fuck those bitches who complain about frizzy hair, or about having 'too much' hair.  If you don't like it, shave the shit off and give it to me!    As embarrassing as it is for a man to start balding at the uncommonly early age of 24, how bad do you think it is when the same thing happens to a woman?  For christ's sake, I look like fucking gollum.  Pretty soon there will be nothing left.  Anyway, just wanted to give a view from the other end of the spectrum.  The "I'm a balding woman at age 24" spectrum, which definitely does not have enough of a voice in the media, nor enough lobbyists in Washington.    On another note, I TOO think Paris Hilton is unbelievably creepy.  She is one of the reasons I am an atheist.  I think a fairly good horror movie could be made based on my reaction to her existence.  If I ever saw her in the street, I would probably just lose my mind right on the spot.  She is that disturbing.    I just got bitched at by some fucking woman at the Cambridge District Court.  Apparently she is so much smarter than me, even though she has been filing papers in a basement from the beginning of time, and will continue doing so until the end of her miserable little life.  Who's the smart one now?

      Ok, here is a long overdue rant on something that makes me so absolutely disgusted - open toed, strappy (and usually backless) sandals that people wear to WORK.  Tis the season for this type of bullshit, and it just makes me ill.    For example, Patricia and I saw a woman walk past the school yesterday afternoon after we got out of work.  She was an older woman, probably early 40s or something.  She was tall and a bit big, but nothing nasty or anything.  She was wearing a nice linen pant with a similar blouse, which I didn't have a problem with.  Then she totally RUINED it all by wearing - the strappy backless high heeled sandals!!!!!    Why, god, why?  I hate them, especially in a situation like that.  Her giant, flat feet were stuffed into the straps, and they were a bit too small so that the back of her heel was kind of hanging off the end.  She looked like the leaning tower of Pisa, like she was about to collapse at any moment.    What makes anyone think that this kind of foot wear is even remotely acceptable?  All that toe cleavage is entirely inappropriate for the workplace, and it's just plain nasty.  They make that awful clacking noise when they slap the bottoms of people's feet.  And they're so minimal that the person might as well be barefoot; it's a broken ankle just waiting to happen.    I have come to the realization that there is a correlation between the people who wear these types of horrible shoes and the people who actually go out and get the french manicure looking shit on their FEET.  Utterly wrong.    Next time I see one of these freaks I am going to pull off their sandal and proceed to bash them in the temple with it Single White Female style.  Ok, maybe I won't, because that would involve getting near their funky feet in the first place, but I will imagine it in my head.  These people will someday get their due.  Just watch.

      Is this thing on?  I'm not really that good with computers.  But Wendy told me to start a blog, and so I have, because I always do whatever Wendy tells me to do, especially in the S&M sense.    Some may say "Sara, you don't want to start a blog."  To these people I say "But I do.  And I'm sorry, but it's not going to stop."    All right people, prepare to be disgusted, horrified, insulted, degraded, and many other things you thought you would only feel back when you were an alter boy.

      Wendy is my best friend in hell.  She is my muse, my raison d'etre, my sugarplum fairy, my black Bridget Jones.  And, thanks to recent developments here in Massachusetts, she can someday be my wife (it would be worth it just for the look on Donna's face).    So this post is dedicated to Wendy, without whom I would never have had a 60 year old stripper slapping me in the face with her sagging, wrinkly tits while I was on the can.  Such are the wonderful things that can happen to someone lucky enough to be friends with Wendy.    Cheers to the girl who introduced me to Popeye's, Jeff Buckley, Tony's, the Claremont, Community, and Rue.    I love wendy like a fat kid loves cake.  I would tell all of you to go out and discover the wonder that is wendy, but then you would all fall in love with her too.  And that can't happen, since I am not willing to share.    Back off sluts, she is mine.

      I told Joel about Aimee's blog, and that Wendy has told me to make my own blog, etc...  He writes back and says that we should create one together (a joint blog!).  Can you believe this kid?  As if.    First, Joel and I are nothing alike.  He will hate everything that I post here.  In fact, he's probably just seeing that picture that I uploaded a few minutes ago and spewing his brains out at work.  He has quite the weak stomach, and I'm sure that picture is enough to send him over the edge.    Second, who are we?  Sonny and Cher?  We don't do things together.  Separate is as separate does.  Joint blog.  Makes me want to retch.  That's almost as bad as him expecting me to take his last name.  On the list of shit Sara will never do in a million years, it's pretty high up there.  Although, it's quite a long list, so maybe that's not saying much.      Third, I will hate everything that Joel wants to post.  He will post severe weather warnings, french vocabulary, gardening tips, and new recipes that he has found.  Seriously, watch it happen.    Anyway, I just wanted to share with you all Joel's comments after I told him I will absolutely not do a joint blog with him:   "Fine, I will take this in my own direction.  Besides, I cant let you limit my creativity and fantastic personality.  Mine is going to be so much better."    Bring it, Joel.  Bring it.

      So, Alex got a new car.  A brand new 2004 Honda Accord to be exact.  He apparently got this car yesterday and drove all around in it, basking in it's newness.    Alex, you bastard!  I have yet to ride in said car.  I suppose you consider the people you "live" with, your "roommates", to be more worthy of a ride in the new car than me and Joel.  Granted, they probably are more worthy.  And cleaner.  And more considerate.  And nicer to you.  And they most definitely smell better (I'm talking about you Joel!).   But Joel and I were just sitting around all night last night doing nothing.  Well, Joel was watching I Love the 90s and I was playing the Sims, so really we were doing nothing.  You should have swung by in your brand new pimp mobile so we could go flossin'.  Instead, I was forced to play hours of the Sims, which included making you and Seth fall in love, and making Alan marry Sarrrrrrrra (they now have a baby named Kennedy).    So just forget it now.  I'm not interested in your fabulous lifestyle.  I suppose now that you have this car you'll be trying to pick up women like Paris Hilton and the like.  With the way you talk about it, you'd think that you were going through a mid-life crisis and just bought a Porshe!  So I want no part of this.  No way.  Don't even try to offer me rides in a car that actually has power steering.  And power everything else.  And air conditioning.  Nope, I am just too good for that.  So you just stay away from my Hyundai and my Sims-saturated universe.  Good day, sir.    I said good day!

      ok, so I read the Robert Jensen article that Aimee provided the link for.  The man is obviously well read and articulate, and I agree with his Anti-Empire political leanings.  However, all that happy horseshit aside, I can't really totally buy his article "critiquing" the 9/11 film.  I mean, some of the shit might be true, but......    First, who ever said that Michael Moore was trying to make an Anti-Empire movie?  A lot of Jensen's comments seem geared towards the fact that Moore should have made an Anti-Empire movie, not an Anti-Bush movie.  While I may agree with that statement in some ways, I'm not the one who made the damn movie.  Maybe Jensen should make his own fucking movie.  Maybe he should give his time, money, and energy to the making of an Anti-Empire movie.    And by the way, Jensen seems to think that if the movie had been made the way HE wanted it to be made, it would have changed the world!  He makes it seem as if people would rally around in opposition to today's two-party system, and there would be a revolution of such force that the government as we know it would be toppled and oppressed people everywhere would rejoice in their new found freedom from tyranical rule!  RIIIIIGHT.  Hello, Mr. Jensen?  This is France.  It didn't work for us.  Get the fucking net.  Anyway....         It seems like there is this constant competition among people to see who can be the MOST left wing, the MOST liberal, who can point to and condemn the most instances of the subtle racism that plagues our society.  It kind of reminds me of that episode of the Apprentice where one girl says to the black woman "that's the pot calling the kettle black", to which she responded "there you go with your racist comments again."  HAH.  And the sad thing is, some people didn't even understand why the comment was so hilariously funny!  fuckers.        Although it's true that Michael Moore did not emphasize the treatment of Arab americans since 9/11, I fail to see that the mere fact that a white man who was harassed by the FBI for making anti-Bush comments was included in the movie therefore makes it racist.  PLEASE.  Also, about the Coalition of the Willing - Iceland was also listed in that segment.  Iceland is one of the whitest places on the PLANET.  Also, Morocco DID offer to send in monkeys!  How is showing a picture of running monkeys, when Morocco offered to send them, in any way racist?  Just because they are monkeys?  I think THAT is racist.    I think the point of the segment was to show that the other nations who were a part of the coaltion have basically no military at all, and were therefore only useful in Bush's attempt to make people think that other nations supported our military actions, when in fact every nation that mattered in the military sense did NOT support our actions.  I did not get the feeling that Moore was pointing to the fact that the other nations weren't WHITE as a way of making fun of them.  Paranoid much?  But then again, I'm about as white as Powder, so I guess I have no right to discuss issues such as these.     I'm not saying Moore's movie is great, or that it couldn't have been done better.  What I am saying is that the film has a purpose - to get Bush out of the White House.  And I think it can help with that purpose.  And getting Bush out isn't the ultimate solution to all of the nation's problems, that's true.  But let's be real people.    This ain't no fucking revolution.

      So, motherfuckers, how were your weekends?    My weekend got off to an early and unintended start.  On Thursday night, Patricia, Dawn, and I went out for a few cocktails in this lovely city.  While going down the stairs to the Park Street T station, I rolled my ankle.  Really badly.  I heard popping and snapping sounds, I saw stars.  That definitely SUCKED.  I haven't hurt myself like that since I was in high school and playing sports.  By the time I woke up on Friday, my ankle was the size of a baseball, and putting on a shoe was just out of the question.  And so, I stayed home from work.  Most of the weekend was spent limping around and not wearing shoes, which I HATE.  I hate being barefoot.  This morning I am back at work.  The swelling has gone down some, and the colors have changed to yellow and brown.  And, I can wear my shoes, albeit uncomfortably.  So that's that.    I saw 9/11 this weekend as well.  Aimee's comments are definitely noteworthy and I agree with them.  While I wholeheartedly believe that Bush is the anti-christ, the movie definitely suffers a bit from tunnel-vision.  I do not believe that 9/11 occurred because Bush's family had financial dealings with the Bin Laden family.  That's just crazy talk.  However, I'm glad this movie was made and that people are seeing it.  I am a card carrying member of the "shit all over everything and never be satisfied with anything" phenomena of our generation.  So it's easy to find fault with anything, anywhere.  But the portion of the movie dealing with why we are in Iraq and the fucking freedom/fear rhetoric that has been going on since 9/11 definitely rang true with me.  That, in my opinion, is reason enough for anyone to see the movie.  And also, the shit was damn funny.    I hope all of you have been reading Joel's blog.  His last post is all about coming "out" as an addicted smoker.  For years now he has been saying "I'm not addicted, I just enjoy it", right before he would beg me for a cigarette (since he rarely has his own, cheap bastard).  It's just part of his inherent hipocracy (should be hipoCRAZY, I think.)  He actually believes that he has just NOW become addicted to smoking, after 6 years.  BULLSHIT.  Any smoker on the planet will tell you that shit stinks.  It's a damn lie.  But, if he wants to live in his fantasy, I say bring it on, since it certainly is entertaining.    Shit, it's almost 9:00 am, and I haven't done a damn thing yet.

      Today's Tip of the Day is:  When you go outside for a cigarette break, don't take your whole pack of cigarettes with you.  Just take one cigarette(or two, if you don't get a break very often and therefore become a chainsmoker for 15 minutes, twice a day).  That way, when the soiled masses start coming up to you and asking you for one, you can honestly tell them "sorry, I don't have any more, I only have this one."    Seriously, every time I step outside this building it's like a plague of assholes decends on me.  Dozens of people ask for a cigarette.  Even when I tell people I don't have one, they still act like assholes.  Sometimes people will say "yes you do, don't lie to me." or "yeah, right" or "ok, then can I have some money instead?"  fuck those fuckers.  I am DONE giving out cigarettes during work.  So I only bring one downstairs with me.  And the next one of those dirtbags who accuses me of lying is going to get a cigarette all right: the burning one that was in my hand just seconds previously will all of a sudden come to rest right in the person's eye.    I am not cigarette welfare.

      You know those people who insist on continually talking on their cell phones while driving?  You know, those morons who can't possibly do two things at once and end up being a menace to themselves and others?  Well, I hate them.  And I know you do too.    But listen to this - how about a guy on a BIKE that is talking on his cell phone?  Doesn't that seem like an even worse idea than driving and talking on the cell at the same time?  I think so.  But apparently, not everyone harbors these same perceptions.  I was outside smoking a cigarette only minutes ago, and I saw a man ride by on a bike.  He was also talking on his cell phone.  And what happened you ask?  The fucker crashed right into the damn curb, and was launched off his bike and onto the hard concrete.  I believe he broke his cell phone.    Just when I think my day is going poorly, something like this happens and makes my entire world brighten.  Now that I have witnessed that man crashing to the pavement, I feel like my demeanor has been scrubbed clean of all the dirt and filth it had accummulated since this morning.  Nothing short of seeing an asshole get his due does that for me.  Ah, what a wonderful world.

      So, this morning I had to go back to Middlesex Probate for the 3rd day in a row because those people are entirely incompetent.  I get there, I wait in a long line to get the file I need, find out they LOST the file, wait an HOUR for them to find it, wait in another long line to get the will allowed, go back to the desk and wait in another line to give them back the file, then wait in another long line to order a copy of a document.  It took almost two hours.  So I am really really angry when I leave there to go get the bus back to the office.    In case some of you don't know, on Monday they began busing people in between Government Center and Lechmere station, while they do construction.  This is supposedly going to take a whole year, and it's hugely inconvenient.  It takes about 20 minutes in between on the bus instead of 5 on the train.  So I went to go get this bus.    I had an argument with the bus driver.  I haven't bought my new T pass for this month yet, because I am lazy, but I've really only been taking the bus, then using the transfer that I get from that to get home at night.  So, I only brought 90 cents with me for the Lechmere bus back to the office.   The bus driver stops me and insists that it's 1.25 for that bus since it is replacing the T, therefore he requires a T fare, not a bus fare.  I tell him that although that may sound logical to him, 1) it's still a BUS, 2) I don't have any more change on me and I am NOT getting off the bus, 3) I think the extra 15 minutes it takes me to get to where I'm going because of this mess is worth the extra 35 cent savings and 4) it's not my fault that the MBTA has decided to inconvenience me for an entire year with this busing sh*t, so he's not getting an extra 35 cents out of me.  This happened right after I had left the courthouse and I was feeling particularly confrontational, since I had to be all peaches in cream at the probate desk in order for them to help me, when I really just felt like jumping over the desk and bashing their friggin skulls together.  I think the bus driver could tell that I was homicidal, so he just let me go without further rebuttal.  That was probably a smart move on his part.

      i'm trying out this new feature where i can simply send an email to my blog  and it will publish automatically.  this could either be totally awesome or  the worst thing that's ever happened.  ....we'll see...  not to worry-- i don't have pink eye.    yesterday i woke up and my eye was all gross.  the previous night it had been itchy and watery and meagan suggested (half-jokingly, i think) that i might have pink eye.  but, when i woke up and my eye was crusted shut i thought, "hell, maybe she was right."  as soon as i got to work, i looked up conjunctivitis on webmd to see what my chances of survival were.  as can be expected from webmd, one of the first things that popped up was cancer.  fabulous.  but, before i could begin planning for my eminent demise, i thought i might want to get a second (medical) opinion.  so, i called to make doctor's appointment for later on in the day.  when i walked into the office, i was confronted with a woman who was essentially my shorter, older, asian twin.  she seemed to have the same general distaste for human interaction that i do.  and the same tendancy to talk to fill the awkward silence-- a silence that only seems awkward due to our own inherent social ineptitude.  as soon as i walked in the door i launched into my explanation as to why i was darkening her doorstep.  she laughed right in my face.  nice bedside manner, by the way.  apparently, not too many people make an emergency appointment because they think they have pink eye based on a diagnosis from webmd.  with that out of the way, we started talking over each other.  both trying to reassure the other that there was actually nothing wrong with me so we could end the agony of conversation.  it went a little something like this:   doctor: so, how's your ankle?  giving you any trouble? me: now that you mention it, yes.  it's been making a horrible clicking sound, it hurts when i walk, and i can't rotate it at all.  but, it's probably nothing, right? doctor: oh, that doesn't sound good.  maybe there's water on it.  or, maybe it's nothing.  you're right.  it's probably nothing. me: oh, good.  it's probably nothing.  thanks. doctor: yeah.  probably...  she looked at my eye for about half a minute before issuing her diagnosis: "well, i think it might be a little infected.  maybe some dust got into your eye."        "dust".  i believe that's the scientific term for "shut up, crazy, and take your prescription for placebo drops on your way out."    i left the office feeling healthier than ever.  i was limping from the wincing pain in my ankle and my eye was watering and itching like hell, but i had a huge smile on my face.  i'd heard it from a professional that i was sound as a pound.  and that's all i needed to hear.  who am i to argue with medical science?

      sorry, sara.  this may be a new blog post.  but, you've already heard this before.  i thought i would post it here, though b/c it's on my mind.  again.  on my way to work this morning, i saw a poster advertising michael moore's new movie, "farenheit 9/11".  some saavy activist/grafitti artist had defaced the image and it got me to thinking.  michael moore is a total hack.  i don't respect him as a human being and as a documentarian or investigative journalist, he's unprincipled and irresponsible to say the least.  so, while i mostly agree with his politics, i can't in good conscience get excited about or encourage others to see his latest movie.  especially in light of his recent shenanigans about the release of said movie.  please.  i'm not fooled for a second by mr. moore's shameless posturing.  let's see, i'll get money from disney to make my movie, then talk about how much i hate corporate media, then i'll facilitate/fabricate a "controvery" about how disney won't release my movie...thereby assuring myself a big box office AND maintaing my corporate underdog status.  give me a break!  i'm not buying it.  why?  because it's not for sale.  if any documentarian is going to have enough of a name to get independent and private financing for his film, it's this guy.  hell, he could have bankrolled it himself with all of his cash.  but, he   had    to get to get the money from miramax/disney.  why?  for the reasons i've just laid out.  mr. moore is a fame whore who will stop at nothing to get his ugly mug in the papers.  that being said, i signed up to get free tickets to a showing of it at the aclu tomorrow.  so, i'm going to see it.  but, i don't intend to spend one red cent on it.    in your eye, moore!  in. your. eye.

      I'm sorry aimee, but on a scale of 1 to suck, your argument is definitely towards the suck side.    How can having frizzy and unmanageable hair be worse than being a bald woman?  It just can't be.  Plenty of people have frizzy hair just like yours.  When someone sees you on the street, they may think 'damn, that's some big hair, she should use frizz ease' or some shit like that.  On the other hand, when people see me, it's like 'oh my god, I can see her scalp, that's really nasty.  I wonder what's wrong with her.  think she has cancer?'  Huge difference.  It also doesn't help that I'm the size of a hobbit, so everyone can look down and see the scalp quite easily.    I too would shave me head if I could, and just be done with it.  But of course, I also have the same reasons as you do for not being able to do it.    So you see, I win.  Or rather, I lose.  In a big, big way.  But on the bright side, at least some part of me is 'thin', even if it is only my hair.

      sorry, sara...  but, i have to rebut.  at least you have hair?  believe me, if i didn't have a head shaped like a troll doll and didn't actually need to keep a job, i would absolutely shave my head clean.  anything would be better than the countless useless fuzzy strands i currently have populating my scalp.  as soon as the weather hints at moisture, my hair balloons up to the size of a hula hoop.  i'm all curls and frizz; no substance.   every day i go through the same tribulations.  i wake up and spend ages doing my hair.  treating it right with shampoos and conditioners and the right amount of indirect heat.  when i'm done, i've got a coif of enviable, gorgeous hair (well, maybe not that enviable.  it's still two-toned like a mo-fo).  then, as soon as i step out into the human soup that is new york city, it starts rebelling.  at first it's just the cantankerous ones up front at the crown.  then, word spreads and by the time i get to work at 8:30 in the morning it's full-on mutiny.  i look like i just went through 40 hours of shock treatment.  and then was set on fire.    looking my absolute worst every single day might not chafe quite so much if i didn't have a glimpse of how good it *could* be-- it almost was...if only i never ever left the house.  damn.  that kills.  why do i even bother?  oh, right.  because i look like shit in hats.  oh, and p.s.-- this applies to my hair year-round, ladies and gentlemen.  year. round.  'nuff said.

      o.k., i felt bad about that last post.  i shouldn't let my seasonal depression seep into my blog.  this isn't livejournal, for fuck's sake!  i watched the simple life last night.  i don't know, those two girls just make me so sad.  the whole time i'm watching it, i'm thinking, "oh, this is funny."  they say hilarious things, so it's good t.v.  but, then they say really fucked up things like, "that's so ghetto." as if either one of those pampered princesses have ever even seen a real ghetto...let alone understand what the word means.  and when i start to analyze it like that, it makes me sick.   i guess that's the minefield that is reality television.  human beings are flawed and if we scrutinize them too closely, we'll just be saddened.  but, as pure fluff, it's pretty damn funny.  i especially like nicole.  although, the whole time i was watching it, i was wondering if this was filmed before or after she went into rehab for heroin addiction.  and that was pretty distracting.    paris is creepy.    i just found out that paris and lil' john are hanging out these days.  what?!  that's so so wrong.  what could they possibly have in common?  except, i guess a shameless desire to garner more and more fame and money.  how very shallow.  and very hollywood.  they deserve each other.  i hear they're collaborating on a rap-pop album.  i'm sure it'll be nothing less than pure genius.  paris and lil' john can do a polycultural jig over the bloated, fetid corpse of what we used to call hip hop.

      i started writing this blog earlier today.  it was all about human relationships and buddhist philosophy, if you can believe it.  some maudlin bullshit about how we depend on other people to make us happy, when we should really look within ourselves to find peace.  can all that noise.    i'm in a bad mood today.  it's humid as all hell, my hair looks like a brillo pad dipped in animal fat, and i have a splitting headache.  i have to decide between being a good friend to my roommate and going home to wait for her boyfriend to get in from scotland OR being a good friend to someone at work and going to a doctors without borders lecture.  i pretty much lose either way b/c i'm not in the state of mind to be social tonight at all.  all i really want to do is go to my room and cry.  it's a crying kind of day.

      i no longer have a cell phone.  it's been exactly 16.5 hours and i can barely function.    but, discussing our culture's dependency on digital technology is not the point of this blog.  please.  what do you take me for?  an intellectual?  hardly.  i'm a cantankerous old fool.  and i'm about to get grouchy with it--  why don't i have a cell phone?  let me explain.  see, when i moved to new york from atlanta, i thought it was too much of a hassle to bother with changing my number.  until about 2 weeks ago when jason casually asks me how much i pay for my cell service.  when i admitted it was a whopping $80, he was dumbfounded and told me that as soon as my contract runs out, i should switch to a more reasonable company.  turns out, my out-of-state number was racking up some serious fees and surcharges.  thanks for nothing, sprint!    contract.  you raise an interesting point, john...  turns out, my contract expired 2 years ago.  i was in the clear!  so, being the genius that i am, i decided to not waste any time and cancel my sprint service immediately.  why the hell not, right?  in my haste, i failed to set up replacement service for when sprint was over.    instead, i thought-- it'll take two seconds.  i just walk into the verizon office, put down my cash and walk out with a new phone and plan.  oh, i'm so naive.  on friday i went to the verizon store to enact my brilliant plan.  i picked out the cutest phone in the store, filled out the requisite 9000 forms, and braced myself for my brand-spanking-new '917' phone number.  sadly, it wasn't two seconds after the verizon guy took my forms and entered them into his computer that he went from jolly sales guy to disapproving sales guy.  he gave me his gravest face and said,, "due to your lack of credit, you'll have to put down a $1,000 deposit to get a phone today."    i responded the way any rational person would in that situation.  i said, "say what, sucka?!", grabbed my forms back, and ran out of that store.     so endeth my sad tale.  and, with it, my days of easy accessibility.    not having a cell phone is kind of like being in olden times.  maybe i'll start writing letters.    or, you know, get my mama to open an account for me.

      To start with: two things.  If you don't want to read spoilers about Gothika, this is not the blog entry for you. Secondly, I tried to put this into paragraphs, but blogger.com would rather it look like a crazy person wrote it.  How appropriate given the topic...  So Aimee said I could post on her blog.  She's pretty nice, huh? She's so nice that she agreed to sit down and watch Gothika with me this afternoon.  And what an afternoon it was.  I thought Gothika was going to be one of your sub-par thrillers where no one believes the wrongly accused heroine, who goes through the motions of investigating her case herself (since the police are so corrupt/incompetent) and is eventually vindicated when she gets too close to the truth and the real killer reveals himself.  And, I was right.  But I had no idea that, aside from the last 20 minutes, Gothika was the scariest movie of all time.  I screamed out loud, people...but more importantly, Aimee gasped loudly.  Aimee. Gasped. Loudly.  And there wasn't a bird or a clown involved.  You know that's some scary shit.  So, anyway, the point of this post is not to talk about Gothika. It's to talk about Roger fucking Ebert.  Usually when I watch a movie, I like to check it out afterwards on imdb, and I usually see what good ol' Ebert has to say about it, too.  There was a time, I'm told, when he was a respected film critic.  Maybe he misses Siskel, maybe it's the stroke, but that guy is not on his game.  He doesn't seem to even have the decency to watch a movie before reviewing it anymore. Last week after watching the Magdelene Sisters, I read his review and found that not only had he misspelled a character's name, he had atrociously misstated the plot.  Hello, Ebert? Anyone home? You're fucking busted, dude. Plus, those were real girls you didn't bother to fact-check, asshole.    As for Gothika, he basically tells us to accept the fact that the plot makes no sense and that the end is terribly dissapointing...because that's just what you do when you watch a thriller. I'm sorry, but aren't you a film critic?  I'm fully in favor of suspension of disbelief when watching movies, and I'm not afraid of an ambiguous ending, but I expect the director/writer/gaffer/best boy to extend me some common fucking courtesy.  In a supernatural movie, suspension of disbelief does not apply to legal matters.  The ghost isn't a lawyer, is she? I was totally willing to bite my tounge when the ghost was writing messages on windows like Karen from Watcher in the Woods, but killer mental patients don't just get let out of jail because they're friends with Halle Berry.  And, by the way, Ebert? We know who killed Halle Berry's husband.  Yeah, we do.  The movie clearly wants us to believe that she was somehow vindicated, but I didn't know you could plead "possession" and waltz out of jail like Maria leaving the nunnery. I'll keep that in mind the next time my bus nemesis takes my seat.  I'll just tell them that Ronald Reagan took over for a minute there.  Oops! Pesky guy.    It all boils down to: shut up Ebert, shut up Gothika, and shut up again, Ebert.     -Cara B.

      so, i'm sitting on the train quietly reading my horrible book (as i lay dying-- faulkner can kiss my ass, by the way) and listening to my headphones when a blind man walks onto the train.  and by "walks" i clearly mean, "rampages".  he storms into the train flailing his stick at all and sundry, presumably to get his bearings...but, he was swinging that thing with such fury he almost hobbled me.  he came to a stop right in front of me.  as i was reading and couldn't hear anything, i didn't notice that he was blind.  i just thought he was an asshole and i almost punched him in the face.  when i looked up, it became obvious to me that he was blind and he definitely expected me to get my sight-having ass up out of my seat and relinquish it to him.  which i would have done b/c i'm sort of a nice person.  but, the woman sitting next to me saw him first.  obviously, to prove her extreme martyrdom, she gives me this exasperated look (like she can't believe i didn't get up since he's standing in front of me) and very deliberately vacates her seat.  excuse me, but my foot is broken.  don't i deserve a seat if for no other reason than i got there first?  jackass.  so.  the blind man sits.  and proceeds to make a huge production out of it-- all shifting wildly and whipping around his backpack.  yeah, i know he can't see.  but, at this point, he's hit me with his cane enough times to know where i am.  not to mention the fact that we're sitting next to each other.  where else would i be?     he goes on to pull out this huge ledger-style braille book.  now, i don't know much (or anything, really) about braille, but i have to believe that you'd read braille in much the same way you would read anything else.  this guy was running his hands over the pages with such rapidity i thought he was having an episode.  after every few pages he started rubbing his hands on his face-- up and down, back and forth, and then kissing his hands.    my first instinct was that he was praying.  so, i stole a glance in his direction so i could figure it out.  because, by now, i'm invested.  upon closer inspection, i realized that he's not praying at all.  he's just totally fucking insane.    after sitting next to him awhile, i didn't really notice the slight jostle i'd get every time he started in on his facial machinations.  but, i did start to think about what it would be like to be blind.  so, i closed my eyes and tried to imagine what his experience would be like.  then, i got really freaked out b/c i got really disoriented and thought that if i was blind, i would be falling all the time.  and then i felt sad.  it's no fun being blind.  especially when dumb bitches like me refuse to give you a seat on the train and then get mad at you for being crazy.  and then make it their first entry in their blog.

      i went to the doctor again today.  i spent 4 hours in that office, consulted with two health care professionals for a total of 15 minutes, and came away feeling far worse than i could have ever imagined.  i don't think i've heard anyone say the word "death" so often in a single conversation.    and then it rained.  i think i'm going to spend the remainder of the weekend holed up in the squalor of my tiny room.  i'm done with everything.

      i'm sitting here with my brow furrowed and i can't even do any work b/c all i want to do is sit in a chair and scream my face off.&nbsp; i'm back down at my old desk.&nbsp; however, my old desk (and my old job) currently belong to this old woman named sandra.&nbsp; about 3 months ago i was told that i was being moved from my job as assistant to two people to assisting the director.&nbsp; sounds like a promotion, but really it wasn't.&nbsp; it was just an annoyance.&nbsp; but, i'm a trooper, so&nbsp; i agreed.&nbsp; also, i hated my two bosses, so i was psyched to get the hell away from them.  &nbsp;  however, when i moved to my "new" position, i spent the first month and a half basically working two jobs-- my old one and my new one b/c the old lady they got to fill my position is totally incompetent.&nbsp; i put up with that, too b/c i'm a masochistic idiot who doesn't know how to assert herself professionally.  &nbsp;  it wasn't until very recently that i finally got comfortable in my new role.&nbsp; i wasn't working for my old bosses at all.&nbsp; i was almost enjoying the monotony of it all.&nbsp; and then bam!&nbsp; sandra's son dies.&nbsp; then, she gets hospitalized for having a seizure.&nbsp; and now she's been gone for weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;i got a call this morning&nbsp;asking me to come back down to cover&nbsp;for her while she's gone-- INDEFINITELY!&nbsp; argh!  &nbsp;  so.&nbsp; i'm back at my old desk.&nbsp; however, it's obviously not mine anymore.&nbsp; and it's literally covered in filth.&nbsp; there's&nbsp;papers everywhere.&nbsp; there's a mountain of dust and grime caked up on the keyboard.&nbsp; it's like this desk was excavated out of a coal mine.&nbsp; how can one tiny old lady be so disgusting?&nbsp; god.&nbsp; i don't need this.  &nbsp;  i love how i'm always the one to get fucking fucked around here.&nbsp; it's just not fair.&nbsp; i'm back down here cleaning up her mess-- both physically and fiscally.&nbsp; again.&nbsp; i'm done.&nbsp; this is just it.&nbsp; i'm currently living my own worst case scenario.&nbsp; i'm right back in the job i loathe working for the two worst bosses in the history of the world.&nbsp; i can't quit because i'm too poor to live WITH the job...imagine the&nbsp;horror of living&nbsp;WITHOUT&nbsp;it.&nbsp; i may not get the financial aid that will allow me to go to school in the fall.&nbsp; so, i'll have to forfeit my acceptance to school which,&nbsp;quite frankly, is&nbsp;the one good thing that's happened for me all year.&nbsp; i have yet another stupid boring crush on a boy (which, believe me, i'm really pissed about.&nbsp; i don't want this extra stress in my life right now.&nbsp; my self esteem is bad enough already.)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;i feel like i'm going to burst into tears right now.&nbsp; i'm just so frustrated and i feel powerless.&nbsp; yes, this is my life.&nbsp; smell that?&nbsp; yeah.&nbsp; that's not success you're taking a whiff of.  &nbsp;  i'm just sick to death of everything.&nbsp; i give up.&nbsp; can i resign from my own life?  &nbsp;  o.k.&nbsp; mid-blog update.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  i feel moderately better than i did earlier.&nbsp; nothing is fixed, nor do i see any solutions to my stupid predicaments...  &nbsp;  but, steve asked me if i'd like to go for a walk.&nbsp; and i was like, "hell yeah!"&nbsp; and then diane was going out for her cigarette break, so i was like, "yeah.&nbsp; you're going to have to give me one of those."&nbsp; she was like, "oh no!&nbsp; i don't want to corrupt you."&nbsp; please.&nbsp; corrupt this!&nbsp; don't worry-- she gave it to me.&nbsp; and it was&nbsp;awesome.&nbsp; even thought it&nbsp;was a virginia slim ultra light menthol (gag).&nbsp; it was the greatest.&nbsp; then, when i was walking back from the delivery/pickup i got catcalled.&nbsp; normally, that makes me feel awful and self-conscious.&nbsp; but, i really like my outfit today.&nbsp; i feel really hip and cool.&nbsp; i have on these great earrings which jason said made me look like a ludlow cokehead.&nbsp; hot.&nbsp; so, i'm basically strutting down the street in my impossibly high platform wedges (which i've worn exactly once since i bought them last&nbsp; year because, well, they're impossibly high and they hurt my stupid ankle.)&nbsp; anyway, i'm walking down the street and i hear these guys talking as i walk.&nbsp;&nbsp;it's on the periphery until i hear someone&nbsp;yelling, "what?!&nbsp; you can't even say hi?&nbsp; god!"&nbsp; and i turned around because i wanted to know&nbsp;what all the commotion was about and the guy is looking right at me, yelling.&nbsp; so, i screamed out, "you're talking to me?&nbsp; why??"&nbsp; and he&nbsp;goes, "because you're&nbsp;the only sexy woman on the street wearing a green shirt."&nbsp; and i burst out laughing and said thank you and walked on.&nbsp; then, this woman (another total stranger, naturally) walked up behind me and goes, "well, that was cute."&nbsp; and you know what?&nbsp; it kind of was.&nbsp; thanks, stranger!&nbsp; as pathetic as it sounds, you made me feel ever so slightly less crazy and useless today.  &nbsp;  sometimes being sexually harrassed on the street can be the best thing that ever happened to you.

      i generally hate sundays.&nbsp;&nbsp;it's just&nbsp;my least favorite day.&nbsp; it always has been.&nbsp; sundays make me think of homework and stressing about school the next day.&nbsp; they make me think of sitting in a stifflingly hot and humid church with fans pathetically ruffling the hair on the back of my neck enough to make me remember how miserable i am.&nbsp; if sunday had a sound, it would be the blues.&nbsp; or funk.&nbsp; if sunday had a taste, it would be cinnamon.&nbsp; disgusting.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  however, for the past four years, my good friend, t.v., has&nbsp;given me&nbsp;at least one thing to keep me from sleeping the miserable day away.&nbsp; that one thing is a little show called "six feet under".&nbsp; and up until last night i thought it was absolutely the bee's knees.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  why?!?!&nbsp; why would alan ball perpetrate such a heinous crime on the viewing public?&nbsp; does he have any idea how much money we pay for cable every month?&nbsp; i demand reimbursment for both my time and hard-earned dollar bills, y'all!&nbsp; he took the one solitary character that i have heretofore found no fault with.&nbsp; i thought michael c. hall was brilliant.&nbsp; i thought the character of david was expertly drawn.&nbsp; in short, i loved him.&nbsp; and now he's been ruined.&nbsp; he's going to have to deal with the aftermath of this ridiculousness for the remainder of the season, if not the series.&nbsp; grr!  &nbsp;  that episode was just so impossible to watch.&nbsp; it made me uncomfortable and frustrated.&nbsp; two things i don't look for when watching t.v.&nbsp; i get enough of that jazz in my&nbsp;own life.&nbsp; &nbsp;  i had a lot more steam when i first started writing this blog.&nbsp; but, then i talked to the monkey.&nbsp;&nbsp;she&nbsp;made some good points.&nbsp; she said&nbsp;that perhaps one day we'll look back on this episode and realize that it was genius.&nbsp; maybe she's right.&nbsp; maybe i'm not giving alan ball enough credit.&nbsp; maybe he's pushing the envelope right up to the edge...&nbsp;  &nbsp;  OR maybe he's pushing the envelope right over the edge of the desk and we just watched sfu jump the shark.&nbsp; in which case, he can go ahead and&nbsp;accept my engraved invitation to &nbsp;kiss my ass.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  obviously, i'm too invested at this point to bail out now.&nbsp; so, i'll be tuning in next week to find out if my favorite show just got that much better...or if i lost one of the only things that kept me going on sundays.

      i'm so annoyed.   i just read roger ebert's review of "before sunrise".   shut up.   as much as i make fun of my brother for LOVING "before sunset", i have to admit that i liked it, too. and i was interested in knowing how the stupid story ends with these two insufferably pretentious characters.   unfortunately, i was on ebert's page looking to see if he reviewed "the corporation" (which he didn't, naturally) and i saw that he gave "before sunrise" a million stars. before i could stop myself, i clicked on the review.   damn him!   he managed to reveal every aspect of the film that might have been slightly interesting for me, the potential viewer, to find out. how infuriating! not only is he incapable of researching and writing a decent film review these days...but, he can't even be bothered to stay away from totally spoiling the plot. good grief.   now, i feel like i've been with ebert through a lot. and, for that reason, i've given him more than his fair share of the benefit of the doubt. i did this because, while i didn't always agree with him, i generally took him to be a skilled writer and a well-versed film critic. but, lately he's been disappointing me more often than not. he haphazardly awards star after star to total schlock, and, as cara pointed out in her criticism of his gothika review-- the man can't even be bothered to watch the movie half the time.   oh, ebert... you're pretty spry for a man your age. i didn't realize you were physically capable of jumping the shark so soon after having a stroke. kudos to your physical therapist.

      i went to see "farenheit 9/11" tonight.  taking into account my recent post about it, it will surprise no one that i had some issues with the film.  i got a lot of comments after my first post about how i wasn't seeing the big picture-- that it's amazing that a film like this was not only made, but was also successful.  and that plenty of people wil see this film that may never have gone to see somehing like it before.  it could open people's minds and get them to think.    but, the question stands-- thinking about what?  what i got from the movie is that george w. bush is the reason everything in the world is in the shitter.  9/11?  bush's fault.  poverty in the u.s.? bush's fault.  civil unrest in the u.s. and abroad?  bush's fault.  the weight of the world is on his shoulders.  of course, he deserves plenty of the blame.  but, ALL of it?  come on.  that's the most naive assessment of u.s. history i've ever seen.  and it's a dangerous assumption.  what proof is there that were gore/leiberman in the white house that so much would be different now?  does anyone not remember clinton and his relationship with iraq?  or wha about a little something called plan colombia (i'm looking at you, too, joe lieberman)?  that was not only A democrat, but THE democrat, dudes.  hello.  it's this kind of journalistic laziness that i abhor in mr. moore.    i don't know...  it's late and that movie clearly made me a little emotional.  i've been feeling more and more disenfranchised (in general) lately and this movie only served to push the point home.  my voice isn't being heard.  my views are not represented by my government.  when i look at the faces of george bush and dick cheney and john kerry and john edwards, i can't see that they have my best interests at heart.  i can't even count on the so-called "liberal mouthpiece", michael moore, to present a cogent argument that can hold at least a teaspoon of water.  i'm not saying that we should all boycott the election.  and i'm not saying that it doesn't make any difference who is in the white house.  i'm certainly no bush lover.  i absolutely believe that it matters.  and i'll definitely be voting and possibly campaigning for john kerry.  however, i don't think it's particularly prudent to turn a blind eye not only to what has been going on, but to what is in store for the future.    maybe i'm the naive one.  maybe i'm the crazy one.  maybe i'm just being a hater.  who cares?  these are just the thoughts of one sad girl on a balmy summer night.

      at the bidding of my friend and financial advisor (although, i think he quit after i paid to see 'the day after tomorrow' for the second time...who can blame him?) and in the hopes of becoming less of a financial paraiah and possibly taking one baby step towards adulthood, i requested a copy of my credit report.   there's nothing that can make you feel like more of a total fuckup than seeing in black and white courrier typeface every single one of your fiscal missteps.  and of course, they put the whole damn 5 page letter in bold, all-caps just so you're not mistaken that you are a very very bad person.    dear transunion,   i get it.  i know that i'm a horrible person who deserves nothing more than to be left for dead in the desert, at the mercy of the sun and wild dogs.  i swear, i didn't mean to rack up a whopping $149 in debt at macy's in 1997.  i'm sure nothing i bought then is worth the lifetime of pain and suffering i seem to have accrued at the ripe old age of 25.  if i could, i would totally return it.  please forgive me.  love, aimee  yeah.  i'm pretty sure it doesn't work that way.  the road to hell is paved with sales recipts.  and i'm more than halfway there.  it looks like i've got a lot of scrimping and saving in store for me.  but, hey!  i'm already saving myself money as i type.  i'm home sick today (this time i'm actually sick...if you can believe it.  i hate being home sick when i'm sick.  what's the fun in that?  there isn't even anyone around to feel sorry for me and make me tea.)  but, being home sick does have its advantages.  for instance, i'm not putting myself into harm's way by walking past countless shops.  i'm on the road to recovery here, people...  oh, who am i kidding?  my life sucks.    and i think it's going to rain today.  bah!

      i've been getting a lot of inquiries since my last post about what exactly a 'drant' is.  i'm sorry.  i thought it was common knowledge that a drant is a dress worn over pants (not to be confused with the infamous skant-- skirt worn over pants).  the drant is the province of hippies and faux hippies.  oftentimes you'll find loathesome hipsters sporting the drant/skant situation proudly as well...only in a dirtier, more rackish way.    anyone that knows me can see i'm certainly by no means a hippie.  i hate peace and love and dirt.  i like to wear real shoes and i hate the dead.  no, thanks.  shrugging off the hipster monicker is a little harder b/c, while i don't see myself as a hipster...i guess i do like their style of dress to the point of mild emulation, occasionally can be found listening to their music, and i like irony just as much as the next gal.  so, there you have it.  HOWEVER, i have always come out strongly against the drant.  it's been second in rantings-per-sighting only to the infamous backless shirt (which i will never approve of).    why did i do it, you ask?  well, the way i saw it, i simply didn't have a choice.  i was late to work, had no other clean clothes, and that dress was far too short to wear solo to work.  i'm not a prostitute after all!  what would you have done in my situation?  that's right-- you would have grabbed a pair of black pants, threw them on under your dress, and strode down the street like you knew exactly what you were doing and why.  this is new york city after all.  i've seen people wandering the streets in leg warmers, teddies, chainmail vests...i even once had an encounter with a guy wearing a filthy, tattered ball gown and combat boots.  granted, that guy was a heroin addict proposing marriage to me in washington square park for giving him a dollar.  but, he was still working his ensemble.  in the end, i think i'm going to have to eat my words.  that outfit was damn comfortable.  and cute, to boot.  i'm mos def gonna be rocking it again in the not-so-distant future.  so, when i said i hate drants, i guess i lied.  what else is new?

      i had so many things planned for today.  i was going to set things straight-- really get everything in order.  instead, i spent the lion's share of the day sleeping in some pretty awkward and uncomfortable positions.  not going to bed.  literally, i'd be sitting at the table drinking tea and then ten seconds later i'm counting zzz's.  or typing happily away at the computer and end up taking a 5 minute "nap".  it doesn't help that the dreams i'm having are both disturbing in content and startlingly real in quality.  earlier i dreamt that all of my friends and i worked in a sporting goods store.  i was learning how to skateboard.  and in the back of the shop we packaged cocaine for distribution.  funnily enough, in my dream, much like today, i called in sick to work.  i think i may have narcolepsy.  can you just randomly develop that?  like a cold...or schizophrenia?

      the great thing about being home from work is that you can watch all the crappy t.v. shows that you're too embarrassed to watch when everyone else is home.  like, i'm not going to sit here and watch the entire 4th season of 90210 when meagan's home.  that's just rude.  but, if i'm home alone you better believe i'm kickin' it with the west bev crew.  that's just how i roll.  not so, today.  on sunday we were rendered normal people.  our t.v. is braindead.  we can no longer record 2 shows and watch another.  we don't have a list of shows stored on the t.v. for later viewing (goodbye, walsh's!).  no more pausing live t.v. to make a point or a suggestion or continue a conversation.  gone are the days when we could watch ET and XTRA simultaneiously with the aid of PIP and pause.  instead, we have to sit here like saps and watch LIVE t.v.  oh, the inhumanity of it all...    i don't know how we'll hold up until thursday.  i guess that's why we still have tivo.  and 3 televisions.    it sucks being normal!

      I really do think that the Lollapalooza cancellation is going to set off a downward spiral in my life that I will never recover from.  The one band that I really really wanted to see has announced a headlining tour in place of the former monumental event.  However, the closest date is in Montreal?  Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck!!! I hate you Canada, you dont deserve this.  Nique Le Cananda!  This anger may seem irrational to many, but there is good reason, believe me.  Modest Mouse (which is the band I have been talking about) has only played in New England twice since their inception (which is like 10 years).  I was all set to rock out.    Just stab me in the eye with a rusty nail.

      I'd like to think that New Englanders are hardy people, and infact we are.  Speaking for myself, I'd say I'm one tough motherfucker.  But honestly, I dont think I can weather the Pixies storm.  I've been left out in the cold for too long now.  Where is the love???  For those that do not know, the Pixies announced back in March or April that they were getting back together, and as a result, kicked off a reunion tour.  This is very exciting news, and from what I hear they are still kicking ass like they used to.  I waited anxiously as tour dates were announced, and wondered why they chose to begin in Minnesota, Saskatoon and Winnipeg?  Fuck Canada, they dont deserve special treatment.  More and more dates were added and still nothing west of the Mississippi.  Dates across Europe were revealed pursuant to the west coast leg, once again ignoring their New England roots.  Finally, after months of waiting, the Mullin Center at UMass Amherst will be graced with their presence, but I'm still fucked!  There is only one date, in early December, so I have to compete with thousands of drunken college sluts and the rest of the region for tickets.  This sucks!!  I'm at the mercy of the weather....

THIRD PLANET by Modest Mouse   Everything that keeps me together is falling apart, I've got this thing that I consider my only art of fucking people over My boss just quit the job says he's goiní out to find blind  spots and he'll do it The 3rd Planet is sure that they're being watched by an eye in the sky that can't be stopped When you get to the promise land your gonna shake that eyes hand Your heart felt good it was drippiní pitch and made of wood And your hands and knees felt cold and wet on the grass to me Outside naked, shiveriní looking blue, from the cold sunlight that's reflected off the moon Baby cum angels fly around you reminding you we used to be three and not just two And that's how the world began And that's how the world will end A 3rd had just been made and we were swimming in the water, didn't know then was it a son was it a daughter When it occurred to me that the animals are swimming around in the water in the oceans in our bodies and  another had been found another ocean on the planet given that our blood is just like the Atlantic And how The universe is shaped exactly like the earth if you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were

      So I've been very busy these past few weeks, caught up in a little thing we at work call "Universe Creation".  Let me explain.  Aside from the Big Bang, which theorists believe was the cosmic event that gave birth to the actual universe as we know it, every quarter the ICC (Independent Consultant Cooperative) creates a universe of client data (what I like to call the mini bang).  (As an aside, I was reading a scientific journal the other day and apparently astronomers have uncovered evidence that disproves the Big Bang theory.  This group of rouge scientists have found red shifts in extremely distant galaxies that indicate these galaxies formed around the time of the Big Bang.  Part of Big Bang theory stresses that galaxies must have formed at a later time after the initial cosmic event.  These extremely old, and distant galaxies do not fit into the Big Bang puzzle, which I thought was very interesting.  However, this discovery could just be useful to Bible bangers and creationists, but enough of this for now...)  Back to Universe creation.  Every quarter, portfolio returns, characteristics and holdings are uploaded to the ICC universe of client data.  After the deadline has passed, all this data is combined, crunched, accelerated to the speed of light, and then sent through a cosmic worm hole where it is then ready to present all nice and neat to our clients.  Actually, for those that are familiar with statistical analysis, we are just creating a population of data, where we are able to compare sample data (specific client info) against all peers.  This is especially useful when comparing returns.  Given the competative nature inherent in all human beings, we want to see how we did compared to everyone else.  Our universe allows this to happen.  We are able to determine mean returns for fixed income, equity, and international equity asset classes, amongst a whole slew of others.  Portfolio returns can also be ranked in their respective universes (parallel universes, he he, I can go on and on with this nerdy humor, somebody stop me!).  And so, my deadline is this saturday, so I've been mad busy, and probably busier after this weekend as reports begin to generate.  Just call me He-Man... Master of the Universe!!!

      In rebuttal to Sara's comments on her blog, I feel that I must back up my previous statements with some more information.  It is true that I have been smoking off and on for nearly six years.  However during this time period, I feel that I have always had my cigarette smoking under control.  What it usually came down to was money.  Cigarettes are not cheap.  If I didnt have the money, I simply would not purchase any cigarettes that week.  On average I would smoke about 5 a day, and I am still not much over that amount.  Smoking is something that I enjoy during the summer months.  In summation, I am far from a hopeless addict.  I am merely acknowledging the fact that cigarettes are now a part of my life.  Hipocrazy maybe, but not hypocracy.

      After years and years of denial, I'm finally throwing in the towel.  I am addicted to cigarette smoking, and I really enjoy it.  For those that do not know me very well, this is a huge step for me.  I've been trying to become addicted for years now, without much success, but now things are much different.  Cigarettes are by far not a new thing for me.  I drew my first breath back in my freshman year of college, when smoking was really fun.  It made me all dizzy, and contrary to many, alive.  Yes, cigarettes make me feel alive even though the health problems that cigarette smoking causes are undeniable.  The whole idea of making a conscience decision to partake in an activity that is proven to be deadly is totally invigorating.  I like to compare it to base jumping.  Base jumpers strap parachutes to their backs and jump off of tall things and float to the ground.  This is one of the most dangerous sports in the world, and I'm sure the adreniline rush must be insane, while at the same time addictive.  Each time I light up a cigarette, take a deep drag, and feel that familiar tightening in your chest, and then the long pleasurable exhale, I think of the base jumpers, except I'm seeking a nicotine rush instead of an adrenline rush.  Both smokers and base jumpers know that if they continue their habits long enough, they will probably die from them.  However, that wont stop me.  Perhaps I am justifying a dirty habit, but its taking risks in life that make us live.  I'll probably just end up quitting during the winter like I usually do because I hate smoking when its cold out, its just not very pleasurable.  But for now, pass me the lighter!

       urlLink    All Hail Maria Sharapova!  This long legged tanned Russian Vixen is the new Wimbledon champion.  Not only did she crush (and I say crush) Serena in straight sets, she is fucking gorgeous.  She is poised to become the new tennis megastar, and I think I love her.  Hail Hail!&nbsp; urlLink

      The way my desk is set up at work is quite advantageous.  I have walls on two sides of me and there is a cubicle wall on the other two sides.  There is only a small opening to my desk area.  I call this the "door".  The entire area is really private.  Nobody passing by can see my computer screen, which allows me to play hearts, cribbage and partake in any other risky activities at my leisure.  I listen to music freely and liberally.  Strategically speaking I have one of the best seats in the entire office.   However, a certain grotesquely raffish “Person X” often disrupts my serene little corner.  I can't tell you how many times I've been busily working or even worse, playing hearts, when all of sudden I hear booming "so what are you doing back here".  I fucking hate you X!  One of these days I am going to wheel around in my sleek n stylish black Aeron chair and stab X in the neck with a freshly sharpened pencil.    Most people consciously announce their approach with a paper shuffle, cough or even a soft knock at my "door".  X on the other hand displays absolutely no office decorum.  Sometimes X will even stand behind until I notice somebody is there.  I fucking hate that!    With that said, today’s french phrase of the day is:         On est tous dans le même bateau

      Ok, its about time I posted to my blog, it has been entirely too long. I cant fucking wait to go to Maine in a few weeks, so I thought I would start a discussion thread regarding the trip. Seth had mentioned that there is white water rafting on the Kennebec river. I thought this was a ruling suggestion. I did some research and found a few companies that provide all of the equipment, transportation, etc. Follow the below links to check this out:   urlLink  NC rivers   This place offers trips on the Dead River, Kennebec River and Penobscot River. Looks cool, and rates are posted for comparison.   urlLink  Magic Falls   Sounds gay, but looks ok. Prices aren't posted for this one, but it seems like they do host a bbq after the trip which looks cool.   urlLink  Northern Outdoors   This one looks to be the most reputable. The website is good and informative, the equipment looks state-of-the-art, but it is also the most expensive. Damn, there's always a catch to everything....   urlLink  Crab Apple   I like this one alot. Looks like they have their shit together, and its reasonably priced (competatively anyways)   urlLink  Three Rivers   This one looks EXTREME!! (in a cheesy, Cancun type way) but none the less is priced fairly and seems credible. Oh yeah, and watch your volume when visiting this site, some idiot talks loudly whenever you click on something.   urlLink  NEOC   I like this one alot too.   There are plenty of companies that offer trips that we could take. I think it would be a good idea if we all agreed on this before we go. We must:    A. Agree if we all actually want to do this   B. Choose a company that provides all the equipment, transportation etc, and possibly a bbq afterwards.   C. Make the reservation before we leave for Maine. We'll be in the middle of friggen no where without internet, etc.    Everybody please post comments at the bottom of this message. Once there is a discussion thread going, we can easily get some kind of consensus regarding the trip.  RULE ON
