      2 a.m. and the rain is falling Here we are at the crossroads once again You're telling me you're so confused You can't make up your mind Is this meant to be You're asking me  But only love can say - try again or walk away But I believe for you and me The sun will shine one day So I'll just play my part And pray you'll have a change of heart But I can't make you see it through That's something only love can do  In your arms as the dawn is breaking Face to face and a thousand miles apart I've tried my best to make you see There's hope beyond the pain If we give enough, if we learn to trust  [Chorus]  I know if I could find the words To touch you deep inside You'd give our dream just one more chance Don't let this be our good-bye

      " Accidentally In Love "  So she said what's the problem baby What's the problem I don't know  Well maybe I'm in love (love)  Think about it every time I think about it Can't stop thinking 'bout it  How much longer will it take to cure this Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)  Makes me wanna turn around and face me but I don't know nothing 'bout love   Come on, come on  Turn a little faster Come on, come on  The world will follow after Come on, come on  Cause everybody's after love  So I said I'm a snowball running  Running down into the spring that's coming all this love  Melting under blue skies  Belting out sunlight  Shimmering love   Well baby I surrender  To the strawberry ice cream Never ever end of all this love Well I didn't mean to do it  But there's no escaping your love  These lines of lightning  Mean we're never alone,  Never alone, no, no   Come on, Come on Move a little closer  Come on, Come on I want to hear you whisper Come on, Come on  Settle down inside my love  Come on, come on  Jump a little higher Come on, come on If you feel a little lighter Come on, come on  We were once Upon a time in love   We're accidentally in love  Accidentally in love [x7]  Accidentally   I'm In Love, I'm in Love,  I'm in Love, I'm in Love,  I'm in Love, I'm in Love, Accidentally [x2]  Come on, come on Spin a little tighter Come on, come on  And the world's a little brighter Come on, come on  Just get yourself inside her   Love ...I'm in love
