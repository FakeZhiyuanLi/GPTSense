      kurt is my favorite bro we'd do n e thing 4 each other. if n e 1 touches me kurt would probably kill them if n e 1 does ne thing 2 kurto id probably kill them 2.  kurto is an auto electrician n cuz our town is so small there aint much work here so he moved 2 mount isa.   kurt's really the reason y im like i am. we r so much alike ppl call me kurt junior. we both luv utes n we had the same principle that suspended us both. kurt taught me heaps like how 2 drive, how 2 use a gun, how 2 piss off teachers n how 2 fight.  n e way im gunna go n c kurt 1 day.

      tom was this guy i met wen i was at a friends house in  urana 4 her birthday. He was perfect, he had the best outlook on life n he was a jackaroo part time after skool n on weekends. my friend Adriana got totally drunk n ran off sumwhere n me n Tom had 2 go find her i spent the whole night with him lookin 4 her. the next day me,Adriana n miranda went 2 Toms house (he only lives up the road) his parents were really nice n me n them had a good old conversation bout Tom. lol. it was so cute my last night in urana he rang up my friends house n asked could he speak 2 me he said 2 me i forgot 2 get ur number the other day can i get it now, so i gave him my mumber.  wen i went back home he rang me at least once a week cuz we could never c each other cuz we live 2 hours apart. i talked 2 his mum n she said i was welcome at there house ne time i like. at least some1's parents approved of me. miranda's mum said she was talking 2 toms mum n she was saying how shes never seen tom like that b4 she said his usually shy. i talked 2 toms boss n he invited me to come out wif tom n all the other jackaroos for a week, he said tom neva shuts up bout me n that his gotta meet me, as long as i could ride a horse (which i can) n i can cook good food (being a part time kitchen hand/cook) i neva got back 2 urana.   ive seen tom twice since then now his finished skool n is a jackaroo out past griffith. i still miss him n as soon as i get my license n my ute im gunna go out n c him. :)  Tom was the Perfect country guy 4 me n we neva even kissed. :( but i reckon we'll always b good friends. :)
