       Great ! i can't wait for today! after  long hours of studying ( it seems more like day dreaming ) i finally get to see the st john peoples.. and that forever "black" bro pig. wat a great day to start by receivng a morning call from HUI TING @ 6.45 am. meow meow! despite that wake up call.. i still sleep for another 15 min... then i got ready to set off!  MEOW! i can't wait to have fun! i reached woodlands MRT control station punctually .. at 7.30 am sharp ( the meeting time) hahhaha i saw the whole groups of st john kids siting there as though waiting for their "mother" , which is hui ting.   argh! MY TUMMY cried for food!.. so i comb my bag for that pethectic coupon! god!haha i bought a turkey saugsage burger meal! YUMMY!  but no eating in mrt statioN! stupid rule! but i stil share with the kids! so gald to see them !  but 1 major problem! !!!!! SOS ! our dear "little" ze ling is missing in actioN! he was late ~! where is he? no one got his number!ai yo!  so mdm hui ting decided to wait for him while i bring the rest of the kids to red hill! ARG!  i hate that location! its the place where i have my 2 years of IDOIT NCO camp there! EEEEEEEE - bukit merah secondary school! YAK!  hahhaha phobia.... we have fun  on our journey there! was it total fun all the way? yes? no ?.... NO there was a time bomb news... waiting to explode. the timer tick slowly as time passed... that news was abt to explode. GOD ! i should have just stay at home so that i will not be BOMBed by that time bomb!...( funnny language hor) hahha  NOT FUNNY!   :( :( :( ... time passes slowly... and we are still smiling... wow. we reached the RED hill station - finaly. the air was ever pure and seems so welcoming... ... HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM so refreshing. i just want to have more of this!!! come breeze .. come to me !  " YH! i tell u somthing hor..... yesterday i didn't really sleep la.. but i was talking to someone.." said pig.   ************************************************************************************  TIPS: yesterday i called gavin to ask him abt some contacts of the people. eg hui ting. coz my hp spoil and thus i lost al their HP number. but he told mi he wanted to sleep. and didn't give mi ani contact... to mi the contacts was urgent .. in case today i was late.. at least i can contact hui ting MA!....... *************************************************************************************  " WHO!?" i raised my eyebrown.. expected him to tell mi that it was " U KNOW WHO" "who? say la.... was it her?" i said cheeckily! " it was a SHE , but not her.." he answered just as i was abt toguess which gal was it he said anxoulsly  "... its JIN LI mdm"  WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  no number of EXCLAIMATION MARKS can express my feeling!!!!   the air is making mi PUKE! somany CARBON MONOXIDE !! I CAN"T BREATH! the air is so unpure now! it is so UNWELCOMING PLACE! going to BUKIT MERAH is always BAD LUCK FOR MI! POI!  i mean on one hand , i was sad in the sense that i was disappointed. as he choiced to talk to others instead of giving me the urgent contacts. on the other hand.. it was JINLI! ai yo! i dun hate that person .. but was so call.. scare of her for once.. she ACCUSE mi of saying bad things abt her school ( green ridge)during a competition.. which i dun really remember and even if i do.... it wasn't on intention... and EVEN *if it was....( i didn't and it wasn't)  i didn't spread or shout out my comments to everyone..i was just having a leasuire converstion with my seniors! hai~!  i was to let by gone be by gone.... but .... the way hui shi and jacklynn told mi abt her was awful... they say " ORH!!!! U CHEM LIAO!! U "DE ZUI" her" ...... it sounds as though it was a hellish mistake!   BACK TO PIG!  .... i was angry! very ! very.. not so much(30%) because he talk to him but (70%) because he choose to talk on phone and refuse to give mi an urgent thingy! AI YA! I DUNNO LA! very siao now! now in the right mood! MOO MEOW!   i refuse to talk to him for the whole day.. till now loz... i even refuse to have direct eye contact with him.. i m pure angry! ARGH! ... luckily got hui ting beside mi to talk to mi.. to distract my attention. .hai~! ... the scar is still there even if u are not looking at it.....   just as i guessed... he was the duplicate of mi.... just like photocopy....( maybe for him.. his ink is too much. so balcker than mine) ... if u didn't talk to him.. he won't talk to u .... thats our policy.. i always agree on that theory .. but i always hate it when it is happening to mi! somtimes i really can understand how helpless jacklynn  get when i do that to her... KARMA!!!! KARMA !!!! now pig is doing this to mi.. hai~!....  . aniway.... the SANA course is doing well.. everyone in the hall pass.... and our JANET CHAI got the highest mark!!! SO PROUD OF HER!!! MEOW MEOW !!!!! congrates!  on the way home.... i didn't talk to him .... maybe we were waiting for each other to take the initaitive to start the topic.. but none of us do.. PARALLEL LINES DUN MEET!  but in the MRT.. i realised that for a long moment .... pig was alone..guess he was having problem with his grp of friends..... if the time bomb didn't explode ( in simple eng for gavin's sake coz i know he won't be ab;e to understand ...... if we didn't have conflict in the morning..) i would have gone there... the angel in my head is telling GO! but the  devil in my head is telling mi NO! ... i choose the devil! so sorry!....  well.. thanks hui ting again .. she was siting beside mi accompanying mi.. iw as more fortunate in the sense that hui ting was there for mi..( but 3/4 of the time i was sleeping)   but gavin was alone!  how? i m worry too!  but wat can i do?  i m a stupid fooL!  ... hai~!..... luckily i think when the train reached woodland... pig was perfectly fine with the rest.... if i'm not worng i saw them walking towards mac for lunch ? hahah i think so ba.... HUI TING wanted to go stamps in civic.. and iwantedt o go library to study... wow.. she finally agreed to accopany mi .. for 1 hour.. hahah its better than not.. haha wow! then outside the civic sentre.. we saw ZELING... moo!! he was again.. alone... watching the free sample show displayed outside.. hahaha we stood beside him.. so near that i can ever felt his sweat.. but he didn't realise that i was there.. then i sneezed..... 3 times... * it must be pig that was scolding mi .. i thnk so.. but after that.. abt 10 min or so.. he finally regconise us..... i gave him a can of coke light.... coz i can't finish it... ( dun worry .. its new cann la)_ ahaha   we went to library and sat beside a lady... we do our own stuff.. and hui ting ... as planned..... went off an hour later... THANKS ALOT! meow! hmm... i finished my MAS SPECTROMRTER notes and half of APGP.. then my stomach feel so... so so so hungry again.. so i wnet home .. god@ mum bought a huge packet of NASI BRUaNI....... so full now.. god! i m going to be fat...  oh yes.. in the library ., i sms gavin lots of time.. guess he is sleeping.. but ican't somfirm.. he might be angry with mi.. i apologoise to him ... lots of time.. hai~!..  so now here i m typing the story of my journey to bukit merah! then gavin finally reply!!!!!  "hello....i was actuallysleeping just nowhow do you expect mi to reply? "  then i say sorry again.. then he say....  " can u tell mi why u shout at mi? can't i talk to anyone that i respect? do i have to ask your permission to talk to her until 2am???today in the hall when i there sitting with u guys if elt so unwelcome..once i walkaway and sit alone at e other side u all begin to laugh and joke around,,,do u know how i feel? i already feelso unwelsome here in st john ...why u have to do this ? can u tell me WADS UR PROBLEM?

BULL SHIT! its just a stupid useless character of mine... i m a nobody..  no one to him (or at least thats wat i think) ... ya.. maybe he was right . for once...  i shouldn't control him.. i actually made the same mistake that jacklynn did to mi.... hai~!.... i'm a mirror of her.... pig, dun follow my footstep ! never! just stop right there and find ur own footstep..  i told him i will not bother him in the futeure animore.. i was very depress when is ay that....... i know it will be hard on us. but its the best way for mi not to hurt him animore..   he replied ..wads the problem? can u tell mi wats happening tou ? wat dun bother with mi in the future anymore?  do u know how those words can hurt others mah?  .. ya he was right! mmmmm i was .. once agin hurting him... but i hope this is the last and final times!   yea.... i know how much it hurts him.. as it hurts mi just as much.... i really care abt him..... more than my own blood brother... i dunno la........ give mi sometime.. i maynot be in the right stead of mind now.. sorry if there is anithing ... sorry!!!!!!!!  good night blog.. its a long and teary day today !hope tomorrow is better.... right bro pig?  love, yit hann   * ps.... thanks Xiao chuan for helping mi to register the blog.. coz i m a newbi here... hahha  look at the comment !!!

HE did mi proud! ahahah coz one day ( i forget when le ). We pass by an old lady selling tissus paper outside the library, near the road. She was singing some odd tune while selling. i've decided to callit -  THE tissue paper SONG . anyway.. no one cares abt her... NO ONE! but PIG! he gave mi a dollar and ask mi to buy from her 3 packets of tissue! haha i'm so proud of him! MOO!  ok back to today !  today i m really having my LAST paper - the listening comprehension paper ( chinese ). in the morning, when i reached school.. i couldn't regconise anibody that i know... except that there is a figure outside LT4 that look abit familiar. i walk nearer,moo!! its ANGELA ! hahah ( she is an ASEAN SCHOLAR from malaysia that was posted in our class for 1 day onli..  but we became very very very good friend within an hour or so) this is because.. she knows my cousin !!! WEI QI !!! hahaha wat a small world!!! it is even smaller when she told mi today that her mother actually was a friend of my MUM  aas they came from the same hometown!( pekan nanas)!!!! WAT A EVEN SMALLER WORLD !!!!! SMALL TILL!!!!!!  hahahaha we really have lotsa common topic to talk abt! cute gal! we chated abt NS in malaysia. and her friend ( another asean scholar i suppose who also went through the NS ) join us.. hmmm i wonder wats his name.... haha hope to know them more! anyway.. i really have a nice time chating with them! ahaha cool people! we are all malaysian! anyway.. she is going back to malaysia ( KOTA TINGGI )after the exam! have a nice journey ANGELA !  hmm..the exam was tough .. i think i got  alot ( or if i choose to use a eupherism ) SOME wrong ! hahaha after exam ... the gang discusse abt the CIP of the DIVA football thingy. hmm.... in the end , we no need to go to serve CIP! hai! GOOD !we went to the seragoon market to have our dinner. JIA YU told us that she is most probably leaving!!! WAT !!!!! ai yO! i wanna leave too! ITS ALL THAT SPERM'S ........okokok!!

      HI BLOG ! wonder y i pose a new message? coz i'm thinking about jacklynn and gavin's problem.... its really very sad.... i can't stop thinking about the past i have with jacklynn. ... why things turns out this way? i read again the "story" about me and her, how it starts, how it ends... ... how come we are not even friends ?  yes.. i read again the poem i wrote.... to many.. its just a freaky lousy poem.. coz they dun know our story ... they DUN !.. so the owrds in the poem makes no sense to them.. but to some.. who witness our start of friendship to the end..... knows wat i m taling about.......... sob sob....   to you know who :    “Loves never started, But somehow it ended. I – a fish lives with no water, Had lost a special friend.  Seconds pass by slowly, A day seems like a year. I can’t lose that special friend. Like a car without a gear.  You insisted that its not my fault. You said you’ve too much thought. You said I’ve done too much for you. And it is time to stop.  You wanted a life way before me. You wanted a love a rich couldn’t give. You claimed that one day I’ll leave. And not even heaven we will meet.  You, my narrator of life, Has decided to quit. You said it’s the end of this chapter, And a new storyteller will read.  I’ll open the door of freedom, That had locked you for centuries. Now, go as far as possible. Never look back – promise me.  Will this be a to-be-continue? No one can foresee. But one thing I’m sure You’ll be happier without me.  Goodbye my friend that’s all I can give It’s more blessed to give, then to receive!    -yit hann  It’s really amazing on how everything could be summed up in one poem. Everything is indeed true. .. yes.. true !   love, yit hann.

      hi blog!,  yea ! finally back !! so cool! HAHAHHA SOORRY BLOG, I DIDN'T WRITE FOR SO LONG! COZ MY pc break down! hehhe ok .. now i shall wirte.!   hmm... so sad .. brother pig and her (jacklynn) argue and fight again .... "fight" literally. the argue over.. funny things la.. things that are not meant to be argue over.. yes.. its that jealousy that brought her to such trouble ( according to her ). Jacklynn told gavin ( just as what she has told me ) , that she will leave his life forever.... yes.. and now they are "stranger". hai~!......    WHAT!!! HISTROY REPEATED ITSELF? didn't she say this to mi 1 year ago ? now after 1 year, its my brother's turn! hai~!..... Y!!! y must this things happen again! y him ? y him ? she did that hurtful things to mi le... now his turn! .... hai~! i wrote a poem to say out my feeling.( though it sux la)  When autum goes, and winter comes, true friend will stay, no matter what has been done.  Those who can't stand the big wind blow, Can't withstand the rush river flow, has their heart once full of joy, turned sorrow.  Red roses turned brown, promises turned to lies. When smile turns to frown, even she turned into passer-by.  When she cares too much, it can be a disaster. It comes to a point which spells  - stranger.   -yit hann    yea! .. hai~!... ya if u wanna know abt the story ..... curosity kills the cat... ok fine, if u claim that u were never the cat.. go to his blog and see the thingy lo!     haha  ok aniway!..
