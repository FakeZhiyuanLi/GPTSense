      bored bored bored bored...talking to Mattias online.  We were just talking about Shrek 2, but now we're talking about rubix cubes.    September just told me a website where i can get Beads and Jewelry stuff for wholesale prices.  I'm thinking of starting that again.  Lizzy keeps telling me that I'm really good and that I should start a business.  Argh...I'm so bored....I need a rubix cube.  Lol.  Well, I guess if I'm just sitting here bored, then I shouldn't sit here boring everyone, if anyone, reading this.   P.S. I wanna leave my dad's house and go home!!

      I just got back from the Charity Garage Sale for my Kidsave Intl. fundraising/volunteering. It was funner than I thought it would be...AND I GOT SOME FREE STUFF! I got some hoop earrings (which I've been wanting and looking for...the only thing is that Alix took the medium-sized ones that I wanted, but if it's free I'm not gonna argue), I got a "Spanish For Dummies" book (hopefully that'll come in handy), I got a New York Grand Central bag (which I'll use for school), I got a gray spaghetti strapped shirt, an really frilly, flowery address book (which I don't really like, but I can use it for internet stuff), and some bracelets. We ended up raising $215 which is pretty good, considering it was just a one-day garage sale.  My dad's lending me these really cool speakers for my computer to use at my mom's house. They're just like little bubbles....so cute. LOL.   I tried calling my mom to let her know that I'm going after school to film my Spanish Project with my group, but she didn't answer.  Helen needs to get online.  I HATE THAT I HAVE TO DO MY BIOLOGY PROJECT PRETTY MUCH ALL ON MY OWN...IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A GROUP PROJECT!!! The outline for our (well, really just my) presentation is due on Thursday and I have no idea what I'm going to say. She didn't even tell us what she wanted us to know about our topic...I said to her, "So, what in particular do you want us to research about biological warfare?" And she just said, "Well, everything." And I'm just sitting there thinking..."uh....that's helpful."  I can't wait until I switch schools  I love iTunes allowances.  I get $20 from my dad each month to use on iTunes! I'd rather buy CDs..but this way I can listen to ALL my music while I'm on my computer and not a 20 song mix, or a specific CD.  I just spent like 5-10 min. writing down birthdays in my Address Book...and I COMPLETELY forgot that i had left this up...well, I better go. I'm starting to get teary-eyed because my computer just finished playing "Graduation" by Vitamin C and that's the song that they played at my 6th grade graduation at Brentwood. I really miss that school. That was my entire life! That was something that defined ME. But I was kind of "dorky" there so I guess a fresh start was good. But still..
