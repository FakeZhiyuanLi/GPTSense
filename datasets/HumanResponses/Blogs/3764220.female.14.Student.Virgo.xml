      2.00pm... and I have another 16hrs and 30 mins before I can see him... I have not seen him for about 46 hrs already... I last seen him was Friday at about 4.00pm like that when we just came back from sentosa... Saturday,which was yesterday, he could not come out as his mother was not at home and he needs to look after his siblings.. And today I could not go out as it's Sunday which is suppose to be my family day and we will be leaving to our grandma hose later around 2.30pm.. haiz... Missing him like hell man.. What is he doing now..?? Sleeping?? Playing games?? He would only be doing these 2 things as he is lazy to do others.. haha.. This is his habit man... Just can't imagine if really we 2 are going to last till I go overseas to Australia to study.. What is life going to be man.. I'm not going to live like that.. How can I keep in contact with him.. How am I going to see him.. haiz.. That really makes me sad.. haiz.. But Just not to think about it man right??.. haha...

      Haiz.. skipped 2 days to write my jornal.. haha.. haiz.. although it's onl 2 days but guess wad?? Lots of things happen in this 2 days..  29/6 : My parents found out that i have a boyfriend outside.. That night, i talk to my mum and she told me that my boyfriend's mother actually called her up to ask if she knows about it and even tell her lots of things.. My parents were very furious therefore rush out to my school to fetch me back from my volleyball training.. i was scolded all the way even on the car or after alighting.. Their mouth was like wa machine gun man.. can't stop..That night my handphone was confiscated and return he next morning.. But one thing was that my dad would bring me to school and after my volleyball training..  30/6 : Yesterday, when i reached school it was like wa very scared that i would be late as the sky was like bright and i'm still at home.. My first period was PE and that my mum says that i called her but i didn't.. I was having PE for the first 5 periods as today was the health fair which we were practicing for so long juz for today.. During the first 2 period, he was also having PE and it was like a terrible thing as the day before which was the day we were found out that we were caught. His face and mine were like charcoal black.. We were unhappy at all.. I went up to the hall to find him get him out and talk to him and yet we finally came to a conclusion and he has been following it ever since today.. cool isn't it..  1/7 :  Today, haha fun day man.. only study for 3 periods of POA and tt's all... fun isn't it... ahha... love it man... Hope everyday like today...
