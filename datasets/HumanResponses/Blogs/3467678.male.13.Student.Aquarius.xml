      EVERYTIME  Notice me, take my hand  Why are we strangers when  Our love is strong  Why carry on without me   Everytime I try to fly, I fall  Without my wings, I feel so small  I guess I need you, baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, it's haunting me  I guess I need you, baby   I make believe that you are here  It's the only way I see clear  What have I done  You seem to move on easy   And everytime I try to fly, I fall  Without my wings, I feel so small  I guess I need you, baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, you're haunting me  I guess I need you, baby   I may have made it rain  Please forgive me  My weakness caused you pain  And this song's my sorry   At night I pray  That soon your face will fade away   And everytime I try to fly, I fall  Without my wings, I feel so small  I guess I need you, baby  And everytime I see you in my dreams  I see your face, you're haunting me  I guess I need you, baby

       STIGMATIZED  If I give up on you I give up on me If we fight what's true, will we ever be Even God himself and the faith I knew Shouldn't hold me back, shouldn't keep me from you  Tease me, by holding out your hand Then leave me, or take me as i am And live our lives, stigmatized  I can feel the blood rushing though my veins When i hear your voice, driving me insane Hour after hour day after day Every lonely night that i sit and pray  Tease me, by holding out your hand Then leave me, or take me as I am And live our lives, stigmatized  We live our lives on different sides, But we keep together you and I Just live our lives, stigmatized  We'll live our lives, We'll take the punches everyday We'll live our lives I know we're gonna find our way  I believe in you Even if no one understands I believe in you, and i don't really give a damn If we're stigmatized We live our lives on different sides But we keep together you and I We live our lives on different sides  We gotta live our lives Gotta live our lives Were gonna live our lives We're gonna live our lives, Gonna live our lives, Stigmatized

      Hello! I am Jazzel Llaneli Escorpiso Manalo and you can call me Jazzel, jaja or egel. I was born on the 10th of February 1991 and I am now 13 years old. I describe myself as a moody girl, sometimes noisy, oftentimes quiet, sometimes I do childish acts, and sometimes I act as a teen. Despite my being moody, I can also be sweet and friendly. Some people describe me that I am intelligent, and a good dancer. Some say I’m pretty and I believe that I am pretty.Ü People say that I’m a snob, maybe because I’m just really quiet. Like all people, I have my hobbies. As for me, I like making friends, texting, chatting, surfing the net, reading books or magazines, listening to all kinds of music, watching movies, talking over the phone, I like road trips and traveling a lot, I love the color baby blue, and particularly, I love hanging out anywhere just as long as I’m with my friends or my cousins. I also love taking care of my nephew and my sister and my other cousin. Whenever I am with them, especially when I’m in the right mood, I play with them and I watch television with them. We love Nickelodeon, Disney and Cartoon Network. I also love to smile!Ü But most of all, I am a simple girl living a simple life and having a simple dream.ÜüÜ
