      Well, here is my first post. I am filled with information and opinions for you all to judge and criticize.  Fun for everyone. Today Tim, Drew and I went to out to lunch and took a long walk through the Valencia outside mall. It was a great day.  We even ate a pazookie!!! Yummy!! An overall terrific day.

      Blogger Blogger Blogger. lame-o blogger. But what exactly should I do with the time that I use to blog?  The question actually should be, what would I RATHER be doing? Well... here is a little list off the top of my pretty little head.  ~Be anywhere with Tim ~Play with Drew ~SLEEP! (ya right) ~Eat something sweet ~Have my fortune read   Well, that is it. Some of you may feel that my tiny list is too simple but in my world it is the only stuff worth doing.  But, the funny thing is that the one thing that seems so simple never is.  Maybe I am pathetic but it seems to me that Tim and I are constantly struggling to JUST be together. Forever it has been this way.  So that is why I blog, because Tim is at work, Drew is sleeping, I can't sleep, I have ate something sweet, and sadly there is no fortune teller around.

      Drews friend from next door is over playing. Her name is Lauren and she is 13 and Drew just loves her. It really helps me too because I am able to clean and Drew is happy to play. Lovely. I am going to go pick up some KFC for dinner in a few minutes and Danyel and her kids are going to come over. One of her kids name is Dylan, who is 3 and also Drews friend. Drew sure has alot of friends for being only 1! More than Tim and I combined! Funny.  I feel so good and happy with everything going on. My house is getting cleaned, and Drew is happy. Everything is going smooooth. *knock on wood*

      We officially own 2 homes now. At least I think it is official. We signed docs today. Drew was a very good boy in the office while we did our thing. I was proud. But yep our 1st payment is due May 1st. YIPPY SKIPPY! Before I know it we will be moving in our new home! I still have so much to do around this house. YUCK! But I am so tired today. I wish i could jsut go to bed right now! But with a dog and a toddler? FAT CHANCE!

      I got out last night to see Eternal Sunshine w/ Jim Carrey. I really enjoyed it. I always like Jim Carrey movies. But I am not a fan of Dumb and Dumber. I just think it is DUMB! Well I really liked the movie it was interesting. I like Kate Winslet. Actually the whole cast was good. The story was crazy and actually something I have thought about before. But I guess I would never choose to erase anything from my mind. It is all there for a reason and I'll keep it. Good and BAD. Besides how good would the good actually be without the bad. There was one point in the movie when "Joel" (Jim Carrey) was in a memory when he was 4 and all he wanted was for his mom to pick him up and it made me think of Drew and how hard it is to be a little kid. I just wanted to get home and pick Drew up and hug him. I also felt I wanted to get home and tell Tim how much I love him, through good and bad and would never give him up for anything, ever! I went w/ my friend Debbie. She felt sick through most of it so she said she was unable to pay attn and did not understand it. Sucky. But she'll just have to go and see it again. I'd even sit through it again. I like to see movies twice. Tim and Bud stayed home with all 3 kids. YIKES! But everyone survived. Tim was playing w/ Drew and there was an incident with the ceiling fan, but everything was OK. Today my plans are to go to the grocery store,  dry cleaners and whatever else POPS into my head. I should go to Kohls to return some stuff. ANYWAYS AHHH MAN Roxie just walked in the door and she IS A MESS!!! GRRR dumbdumb puppy!

      Drew had his 1st bloody nose last night. We were all eating dinner with some friends and BOOM he fell down and hit his nose! Poor boy. But we gave him a cookie and he recovered quickly. Tim is off today and we have lost of things on our list. We want to get Roxie groomed and some other random stuff. Hopefully we will be signing our loan docs today. And we will be the proud owner of TWO homes! YIKES! I was going to get Drews Easter pics taken today but I am unsure. My new camara takes such nice pictures, I am going to wait and see if I should just blow up one of them. And another thing.. at this time next week I will be in KY! It will be almost 1 in the afternoon.  I will be sooo relieved to be arrived. I am so nervous about flying that I just want to get it over with. I have this fear of death, that I can't get over.  I have talked to lots of people about it, nobody professional just friends and family, and they seem to all agree that it is because I am a mom and it is natural. Whatever. I'll be fine. It is silly. Also I think it just upsets people when I talk about it. SO I'll STOP! :)

       The Sun    After school Walking home Fresh dirt under my fingernails And I can smell hot asphalt Cars screech to a halt to let me pass And I cannot remember What life was like through photographs Trying to recreate images life gives us from our past  And sometimes it's a sad song  But I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met you Take my breath away Make everyday Worth all of the pain that I have Gone through And mama I've been cryin' Cause things ain't how they used to be She said the battles almost won And we're only several miles from the sun  Moving on down the street I see people I won't ever meet Think of her, take a breath Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps And sometimes it's a sad song  But I cannot forget Refuse to regret So glad I met you Take my breath away Make everyday Worth all of the pain that I have Gone through And mama I've been cryin' Cause things ain't how they used to be She said the battles almost won And we're only several miles from the sun  The rhythm of her conversation The perfection of her creation The sex she slipped into my coffee The way she felt when she first saw me Hate to love and love to hate her Like a broken record player Back and forth and here and gone And on and on and on and on 	   -maroon 5

      Back from Gymboree! I feel like I am getting a little tired of the whole Gymboree thing. Drew and I may take a break after this session. I would like look into some swimming lesson for him. That would be a nice change of pace.  Anyways, we went to the mall w/ Kelly and Ireland. I bought Drew an umbrella stroller. It is cute and has bugs on it. It is funny hanging out with Kelly. We are so different from each other. Even our clothes are so different. Not that I don't like the way she dresses, it is just different than me. AND NOT to say that what you wear defines you as a person BUT it does effect perception. Right? I dunno. Maybe it is just me and my SHALLOW EVIL WAYS!! But I don't think so. And not to say that everyone needs to dress just like me. Even though the world would benefit. I am JOKING of course!

      There is a BIG Fiesta going on down my street, they have a band and are all dancing in their front yard. I have watched it go on periodically from 3pm till now. Very Amusing group of people. At one point someone got out the hose and was getting everyone wet. My day however did not include a fiesta. It included going to get Drew a hair cut which is VERY CUTE!  It took me awhile to get used to it but it has grown on me. It isn't that different so it is weird that I have a reaction. Then we went to Costco with my mom so she could get a new tire for her car and I picked up some pictures. Which by the way makes me even more pleased with my new camera. Anyways....then I went over to my BEAUTIFUL new house where the current owner (my friend Monica) was having a garage sale. She let me keep a BIG wooden sign that says "HOME SWEET HOME" She is going to hang it right back where it was. :) She didn't even charge me! :)) SO from there I came back home so "Drew boy" could take a little rest. And I did the same while watching SPRING BREAK 2004 on MTV! YEAH BABY!! (not really) Then Drew woke up and we went outside to play and the FIESTA began down the road! After playing outside and spying on my nieghbors we went to Target and went to Tims work to bring him some food. NOW we are home and going to eat dinner and THEN BEDTIME!! PHEWWY! SO INTERESTING!! Right??? I can't believe I even feel like typing all this stuff. Well I am done now.

      Saturday morning.  Well I was going to lay out by my friends pool today but her EX husbands mother and sister called her up to inform her that they are coming over to lay by the pool as well. She said that she had already invited me over but that didnt seem to phase them. I am not really fond of my friends EX and I sure don't want to hang out with his mom. I mean why would I? SO I explained to my friend my feelings and she said sorry but I don't blame her. She doesn't want to be rude and she can't help her intrusive in-laws. So I guess I am not going to go over. I feel bad but I can't help that I feel uncomfortable. But I am going to go to KOHLS with my mommy and grandma. I really should NOT be shopping at all. Lately I don't have any self control where money and shopping is concerned.  :) Shame Shame!  BUT I do have something that I MUST buy today! A poop scoop! Isn't that an exciting purchase? FUN! Surprisingly they are quiet expensive. I am not sure if any of you have ever priced a poop scoop, but I was thinking maybe $10 or so. They all run around $20! I haven't wanted to pay that much but I think I am breaking down. The shovel just isn't working out as well as a poop scoop would. So that is my exciting Saturday. YIPPY!! HAahahahha I would much rather lay out by the pool with my friend but not with a certain someones family members. So poop scoop it is.

      Hello on this Friday morning. Some people do those Friday 5 questions maybe I will too. So far today I have cleaned out 2 closets, vacummed, and folded and put away laundry. I still would like to clean my bedroom floor. Last night Drew was walking around naked after his bath and accidently went peepee on it. Whoopsy. :) Tim gets home early again today. That makes me happy. IT makes my day go along much faster. We are going to grill up some hamburgers tonight. YUMMY! I leave in 10 days for KY! I am looking forward to that. Not the flying part but the visiting part. Last night on Primetime they had this horrible piece on germs in the house. Basically we are all living in FILTH and there is nothing we can do about it but to drench everything in BLEACH! I don't even know why I watched it, all it did is make me all paranoid about germs and YUCKY dustmites! This man mentioned that in pillows 10% of the weight can be DUSTMITES!  Not a nice thing to think about. But what are you going to do about it? BUy a new pillow every other day?

      ahhhh much better. Well, Drew is asleep and the dog is being good. Amazing. Tim should be home any minute and I have this aromatherapy thing around my neck. It smells so good. And American Idol is on.  Now I have tomorrow to look forward to.  I went to Gymboree today and my friend Kelly is pregnant. She has been trying for 4 months and finally got it done.  Her daughter Ireland was born August 2nd. She is Drews girlfriend. He was chasing her around making kissy noises. It was so funny.  I can't imagine having another baby, especially after a day like today.

      Exhausted! I just want to sit down and do nothing!! Today I have been going NON stop since 6:45 AM!!! The dog, Drew and my house run me till my last breath. I don't mean to complain, but phewy! I just want to get Drew to bed, take a shower and SIT! Drew is having his bedtime snack and then it is book time and then sleepy time. AHHHH it seems so far! Some days are like this.

      Good Tuesday Morning It is only 10 am and I have accomplished so much! I love when I get alot done in the early morning.   I also changed my template, I was getting sick of the other one. And I don't think my counter thing is working. Or I just don't have any visitors.   I like Tuesdays because American Idol is on. WHOOO HOOOO! Sometimes I even VOTE! I also like Wednesdays because American Idol AND Newlyweds are on! I am guilt of loving reality TV especially Newlyweds. I think it is the modern day I Love Lucy. BUT I don't like those dumb getting married shows, like Bachlorette. Talk about demoralizing marriage. But some people like those shows or they wouldn't be on.  SO here are my plans for today. SO exciting.  Laundry, post office, Target, Costco, and maybe make some dinner at Danyels. Once a week we get together and try out a new recipe. It is fun.

      SO far we have accomplished alot in our yard. Tim and I are probably the only people who can tell though. Yard work is pretty fun but you have really got to be in the mood. I can't wait to plant flowers in the front.  It seems silly to put all this work into the house when we are just going to get rid of it. But it is all for curb appeal. But who knows, maybe we will keep it. I just don't know if we want to deal with renters and all that landlord stuff.  Decisions, decisions.  One thing I do know is that I can NOT wait to move into our new house! I can't WAIT! Not much longer now. We close escrow the beginning of April.  Buying a house is alot like raising a puppy. In the beginning you have to deal with the puppy chewing up your things, peeing on your carpet, and for a split second you even contemplate getting rid of  her, but you don't because you hold on to your faith that eventually she will stop being a BAD PUPPY and turn into a GOOD DOG!

      Great Sunday and Monday. Yesterday Tim, Drew and I did yardwork. The weather is so terrific you can't help but to be outside. I got a sunburn on my shoulders and at one point I was holding Drew for awhile so I have a little hand outline on my shoulder! So cute I wish it would stay forever. It is a good thing the nice weather is continuing into today because we are not done yet. We are going to put a bubbler water thingy in our front planter so I can put flowers and what not so our house will look beautiful and someone will buy it!! We also bought a digital camara yesterday. I am really happy about that. Digital is the way to go. So yesterday was full of FUN!  Well, I better get to work. Tim is getting anxious for me to get our there and start working:)

      Have some FREAKN" consideration!  The people across the street from me have their horrible music on and it is so disturbing! Granted it is 1 in the afternoon but it shakes my whole house! All I hear is BOOM BOOM BOOOM BOOMBOOm BOOOOMMM! I feel like scraming out my window, "TURN YOUR BASS DOWN YOU ASS!" But that would be insane. I am all for listening to music on a Saturday afternoon but does the whole street have to hear it too? Actually all we can hear is the bass. Boom BooM BOOM!  And it isn't like this is the 1st time I have had to endure this annoyance. It is every weekend and some weekdays. So I sit calmy grinding my teeth with a slight headache because my nieghbor is an idiot. But I will get over it. Until next time.

      My Grandma who is very much a Catholic saw The Passion of the Christ last night and she was very disappointed. I have not seen it yet but plan to. Her major complaint was that it was too much, that he would have been dead long before he did die. And that there was too much blood. Basically she thought it was unrealistic. I am unsure.  I guess if you believe he was the "Son Of God" then he could live as long as he did to really save ourselves for our sins. I don't know it is all very confusing for me. I was surprised at my Grandmas reaction. I thought for sure she would appreciate the film. I can't wait to see it so I can let everyone know my opinion. Most of the people that I know that have seen the movie havent has such a strong reaction as my Grandma, and she is the one who I feel is the most religious of the group. Funny. I guess it could have something to do with her age. She will be 89 this June.

      OK. Well that was ridiculous but I got everyhting straight now. Phewwy. Well, it is fun at least to see your changes happen. Here is my horoscope for today :  Your enemies will think twice before crossing you again. They already fear you. The next step is getting them to love you. Only then will you know that you've truly won. Play your cards right and no one will be thinking bad thoughts about you by the end of the day. You already have so many friends, but why not win the respect and delight of a few more people? Your cup is always full, and the party never ends. This is one of the times that you'll probably remember forever. Roll tape and collect autographs, just to be sure.  Gee I didn't even know that I had any enemies. I guess I better pay closer attention.

      HERE IS MY HOROSCOPE FOR TODAY :)  A love partner could be in a very gloomy mood today, Scorpio. This could be the kind of day when no matter how many times you draw your mate's attention to the doughnut, he still persists in seeing the hole! The glass is always half empty, never half full! Your beloved will probably be this way throughout the day. Don't let it drive you crazy. Just try to see the humor in it. Dare to laugh! That'll help you, anyway!  I love astrology. It is so interesting and fun. Sometimes it seems so right on. And my personality fits my profile pretty close, and some of my friends and family fall into theirs pretty well too. Makes you wonder if the stars really do have influence over us. Why not? The moon effects tides and werewolves!!! Ya know, it would be terrible to be a werewolf! Gosh what a burden. Next time I get frazzled about my daily life I am going to just remember one thing, it could be worse, I could be a werewolf. That should cheer me up. Hell, it should cheer anyone up. Well, I guess it wouldn't cheer up a werewolf. Poor werewolves. I wonder if they believe in astrology?

        I am not exactly sure where I stand in the gay marriage controversy. I guess I am somehwhere in the middle. I do beleive that love is love is love, but I also feel that nothing is either black or white, everything is grey. But anyways here is a funny way to look at the topic.  (A scene at City Hall in San Francisco)   "Next."   "Good morning. We want to apply for a marriage license."   "Names?"   "Tim and Jim Jones."   "Jones? Are you related? I see a resemblance."   "Yes, we're brothers."   "Brothers? You can't get married."   "Why not? Aren't you giving marriage licenses to same gender couples?"   "Yes, thousands. But we haven't had any siblings. That's incest!"   "Incest?" No, we are not gay."   "Not gay? Then why do you want to get married?"   "For the financial benefits, of course. And we do love each other.   "Besides, we don't have any other prospects."   "But we're issuing marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples who've been denied equal protection under the law. If you are not gay, you can get married to a woman."   "Wait a minute. A gay man has the same right to marry a woman as I have. But just because I'm straight doesn't mean I want to marry a woman. I want to marry Jim."   "And I want to marry Tim, Are you going to discriminate against us just because we are not gay?"   "All right, all right. I'll give you your license. Next."   "Hi. We are here to get married."   "Names?"   "John Smith, Jane James, Robert Green, and June Johnson."   "Who wants to marry whom?"   "We all want to marry each other."   "But there are four of you!"   "That's right. You see, we're all bisexual. I love Jane and Robert, Jane loves me and June, June loves Robert and Jane, and Robert loves June and me. All of us getting married together is the only way that we can express our sexual preferences in a marital relationship."   "But we've only been granting licenses to gay and lesbian couples."   "So you're discriminating against bisexuals!"   "No, it's just that, well, the traditional idea of marriage is that it's just for couples."   "Since when are you standing on tradition?"   "Well, I mean, you have to draw the line somewhere."   "Who says? There's no logical reason to limit marriage to couples. The more the better. Besides, we demand our rights! The mayor says the constitution guarantees equal protection under the law. Give us a marriage license!"   "All right, all right. Next."   "Hello, I'd like a marriage license."   "In what names?"   "David Deets."   "And the other man?"   "That's all. I want to marry myself."   "Marry yourself? What do you mean?"   "Well, my psychiatrist says I have a dual personality, so I want to marry the two together. Maybe I can file a joint income-tax return."   "That does it! I quit!! You people are making a mockery of marriage!"

      I love to eat Goldfish baked snack crackers and Pepsi. I eat so much of them that I get a stomach ache.  I have decided that J.Crew is HIGHLY overpriced! Sure some of their stuff is cute put what exactly are we paying for? High quality? Maybe, but all I can tell you is that I order a pair of jeans and I am embarrassed to say how much I paid for them. I thought that once I recieved them they would be worth the extra cost. NOPE they are just regular jeans. Not even that cute. So I am sending them back. Maybe if you all knew just how much we are talking about here you would understand better. Well, I will tell you 85 freakn' dollars!! How insane is that? For jeans? But I guess I have to say BRAVO to Jcrew for hypnotizing me into thinking I needed $85 JEANS!!!!!!! But I am awake now. THANK YOU!!!

      Maroon 5 is a GRRRREAT band. I bought their CD and it is good all the way through. I LOVE EM'! I recommend that everyone run out and buy it! It is called "songs about Jane". If I had all the money in the world I would buy everyone I know the CD just to share such a great talented band. IT is exciting when good, new music comes out. I saw them on SNL a few weeks ago, then the next day I had their CD!!  So trust me and GO NOW!! GOOOOOOO, GOOOO, GOOO!!

      Gosh Jesus sure is all around us. The media is running fast with this new trend. Maybe the end is coming soon. And isn't the best way to reach people, TV and cinema? I don't know. It just is strange to hear about Jesus so much. But I guess it is making people ask themselves questions about faith and what not. I know it is for me. But I may be easily influenced, but actually I think we all are. ANyways. I am enjoying all of it. Keeps the waters moving.

Take out the shorts and tank tops. Put away the sweaters and coats. A new day. Spring 2004! Sounds good to me.

       This is that bangles song I was talking about.  Hazy Shade of Winter  Time time time see what's become of me - Time time time see what's become of me While I looked around for my possibilities. I was so hard to please. Look around leaves are brown And the sky is a hazy shade of winter. Hear the Salvation Army band down by the riverside's Bound to be a better ride than what you've got planned. Carry your cup in your hand. Look around leaves are brown And the sky is a hazy shade of winter. Hang on to your hopes my friend That's an easy thing to say but if your hopes should pass away Simply pretend that you can build them again. Look around the grass is high the fields are ripe It's the springtime of my life. Seasons change with the scenery weaving time in a tapestry Won't you stop and remember me? Look around leaves are brown And the sky is a hazy shade of winter. Look around leaves are brown There's a patch of snow on the ground. Look around the leaves are brown There's a patch of snow on the ground. Look around leaves are brown There's a patch of snow on the ground.

       I started this blog last month and then never returned but here I am!  Yesterday was Tims birthday and I had balloons sent to him and brought him a pizza and an ice cream cake to his work. This is the 9th birthday I have celebrated with him. The 1st was when he turned 20 and I was only 16. Time sure flies. So fast it is almost depressing. "Time, Time, Time look what has become of me as I look around at the possibilities." I think that is some of the lyrics to a Bangles song.

      America is waging a massive war on its home soil, a war it is losing. Our country spends $20 billion a year in drug enforcement, but the illegal drug industry is thriving. Should we even be waging this war, when alcohol is legal and pushed every night on network TV? By criminalizing drugs, we just turn non-violent citizens into criminals. And medicinal uses of marijuana are being blocked by crusading moralists yelling "family values."

      The Washington Post reports on the Bush campaign:   Scholars and political strategists say the ferocious Bush assault on Kerry this spring has been extraordinary, both for the volume of attacks and for the liberties the president and his campaign have taken with the facts. Though stretching the truth is hardly new in a political campaign, they say the volume of negative charges is unprecedented -- both in speeches and in advertising.

      A good one from Pearl Jam!   Pearl Jam lyrics :: Bushleaguer lyrics  How does he do it? How do they do it? Uncanny and immutable. This is such a happening tailpipe of a party. Like sugar, the guests are so refined A confidence man, but why so beleaguered? He's not a leader, he's a Texas leaguer Swinging for the fence, got lucky with his strike Drilling for fear, makes the job simple Born on third, thinks he got a triple Blackout weaves its way through the city Blackout weaves its way through the city Blackout weaves its way,... I remember when you sang That song about today Now it's tomorrow and Everything has changed A think tank of aloof multiplication A nicotine wish and a columbus decanter Retrenchment and hoggishness The aristocrat choir sings What's the ruckus? The haves, have not a clue The immenseness of suffering And the odd negotiation, a rarity With onionskin plausibility of life, And a keyboard reaffirmation Blackout weaves its way through the city Blackout weaves its way through the city Blackout weaves its way,... I remember when you sang That song about today Now it's tomorrow and Everything has changed I remember when you sang That song about today Now it's tomorrow and Everything has changed

      This country is really just Too mUch! Things are really nuts-O! I hate BUSH! I really do! And I can NOT understand why anyone in their right mind could POSSIBLY think he is a good choice for 2004! I think that if Winnie the POOH was running against him I would support Winnie.  The only thing that could be held against him is his addiction to honey. BUT hey at least it's not CRACK!

        You represent... loneliness. Always alone and always sad about it... unlike angst, you don't have to look for a reason to be miserable.  You want to be in the company of people but aren't sure how to act when you're with them.  Sometimes you have to make an effort.  You can't always wait for others to come to you.    urlLink   What feeling do you represent?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Well, I have finally found the time to sit at my desk and play with my template. *Um, that kind of sounds dirty* Anyways, now my Blog is blessed with some FUN and uniqueness!  It is easy to find myself neglecting some of my "duties" if I am not careful. I think I have been messing around with this damn thing for about 2 hours now. It is crazy that much time has flown by! It is some sort of time warp.  Well, I hope all my hard work puts a smile on your faces!

      Today is my Grandmas 89th birthday. I feel that she deserves a fun birthday. So I am trying to make plans for a birthday dinner and movie and cake with NO EFFORT from anyone else in my family. I am very annoyed to say the least! It is like people didnt think she would make it and now that she has they don't want to take the time to acknowledge her 89 years of service. It may be silly but it just makes me sad. Being old is rough. NO THANK YOU!

      OK OK OK! Here I am. I can not express in words how hectic my life has been lately. But it is a good kind of hectic. At least most of the time. I am still kinda sorta living out of boxes but things are coming together nicely. Drews 2nd birthday is Thursday and that blows my mind! What a great 2 years we have had. And so many more to come. I hope to write more on this thing so you all can be involved in my trials. But life gets bouncy, so who knows. At least there is this.
