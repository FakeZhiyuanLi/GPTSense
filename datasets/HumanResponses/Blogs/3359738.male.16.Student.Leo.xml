       I was reading on Slashdot about people's opinions on   urlLink how to avoid getting mugged  . There's some pretty funny comments:    I'm a dorky little Asian guy. I carry 3 knives on me and have trained in Kali and Silat for over 15 years. Not much of a problem here, thanks. BTW, I carry 3 knives now, but I used to carry only 2. A few years ago, I was the target of a mugging attempt. The fellow ran off with one of my knives stuck in his leg. Bummer. I liked that knife.     Here's another good one:   [...metal laptop case. If worse comes to worse, you can swing the thing at a mugger's head] "The dummy brought a briefcase to a knife fight. Lucky me, it was metal and the blood was easy to wipe off."    That's not half-bad. I think I might do that when I'm in uni, plus metal cases look neat.     I'd run the heck the in the opposite direction yelling for help, that should frighten 90% of your average criminals enough to flee. If they have a gun, being a moving, more-distant target will make their chances of actually hitting you drop significantly. Just look at the statistics of *trained* police officers shooting; how do you think a thug with no firearms training is going to hit you from 100+ feet away?    I guess that one would work well. Especially if you're in a public place. If you're assaulting someone and your victim runs and shouts "SOMEONE WITH A GUN! HELP ME!!! THAT MAN HAS A GUN!" it's likely he'll run away. That, or you'll get shot. :/ But assuming it's just a knife, you might be able to get away. Also bare in mind not all muggers are necessarily sportsmen, so if you can run well, you may as well be able to get away. Plus... come on, if you're a mugger and your victim runs away, why even fucking bother going after him/her? There's so many others you could mug rather than waste time running after that one victim, right?   So basically to prevent getting mugged, just look scary, change your iPod earphones to ugly black ones, have your stuff in your pockets, wear average clothes and carry a metal laptop case, not a leather one. It doubles as a weapon, remember.   Hey, I just remembered... what about those crazy tazer guns that shoot clips at the victim and electrocute the person to an excruciatingly painful experience. I imagine one could hide one device like that in your coat, and like press a button and it shoots the clips, and then it shoots a pepper-spray missile that explodes on impact, leaving a cloud of pepper stuff, making the guy blind for some hours. That's not a very bad idea. *patents it*   Hmmm... acting crazy might work too; like when the mugger tells you to give him your wallet, start talking to an imaginary person in your ear or on your shoulder, or behind you, and then have a tick in the eye or shoulder and say that you're schizophrenic. I can imagine the mugger going "What the FUCK!?" and running away. I think the best tactic would probably be to act normal at first, but then start with a tick on your eye or shoulder (or both), then change personality completely and act like you're out of your mind. (Think Gollum when he's mad.) Then you go back to being calm and normal seconds later, and you apologize for being a schizophrenic. THEN right before you reach your pocket, you change personality back to the crazy person and start laughing for no reason with a tick in the eye and shoulder. Again, think like Gollum. The mugger would run the fuck away from you.  Another approach could be to have some fake blood capsule somewhere, then do like you just cut your hand intentionally, and tell the guy you have some serious AIDS problems. [ Careful, as this would only work if the mugger doesn't have AIDS himself. Let's hope he doesn't, shall we? ] Then you lie to him how AIDS is contagious and how one drop could give him it. (You must appear confident when lying.) Tell him that one drop on his skin, mouth, hands, or any cuts could infect him. Then menace him with your hand, or explain him that if you get stabbed, his knife will get all bloody with your infectious blood. Then start shaking your hand claiming it stings, and therefore spilling drops into the air and hopefully onto the mugger's body somewhere.  And what if you happen to have a fair amount of saliva in your mouth at the time you're being mugged? Sneeze violently in his face. He will squinch or close his eyes, and that'll give you the split-second you need to make your escape. [I don't suggest this when the man is wielding a gun.]  How about wielding a hyper-realistic fake gun? Preferably one of those which have those little explosive thingies that make fairly realistic gun explosions, while not shooting any actual bullets. All you gotta do is take it out quick, aim at the guy and frown with a menacing look, then quickly aim to the air and do two or three shots, and aim at the mugger that menaced you with the knife and say "Get the fuck out of my face!" -- boy, will he run! On the plus side, you also don't need a license to carry a toy gun. Why would you want a real gun anyway? You're not gonna shoot anyone. That not only sucks, but will give you serious legal trouble if you DID shoot someone, even the mugger; so do it my way and have a toy gun instead. I don't think the mugger's gonna try to accuse you of anything after he runs for his life thinking you're shooting with a real gun.  You could also consider wearing metal plates in your chest and legs, thick enough to be knife-proof. Also don't forget that a thick coat may save you from a swish on your chest with the knife. Of course it won't save you from a stab. You might wanna wear gloves to try to protect your hands too.  Another thing that might work out is if you had some really strong metal fence-like material, but with tiny spaces, you know, kinda like the # sign looks like. I'm sure those don't weigh much and can be pretty damn strong. You could hide some underneath your coat or jacket, so if they stab you in the chest, the knife won't get to you. But hey, if you get stabbed, DO act like you go stabbed and scream like you were in pain. Perhaps even fall to the floor. Then when mugger tries to get your stuff while you are in pain, you grab his wrist, get rid of his knife, and punch the fucker in the balls. Or if you're on the floor acting like you're in pain and he goes near, take a quick look and aim a good kick at his balls, then run. He won't stand a chance. You might wanna grab your cellphone and call police now that the mugger has been defeated and is trying to recover on the ground from your powerful testicular damage.  Screaming might work sometimes. I tried this tactic one time when I got bullied many, many years ago. (I was a little kid back then.) It worked like a charm. I was surrounded by three bullies against a fence in the playground area, and I suddenly had a flashback of those scenes in Home Alone 1 and 2 where the kid shouts with a loud high-pitched scream, and the bad guys had to cover their ears due to the awful sound. It really worked for me. I screamed for a minute or two, but it only took three to five seconds before the guys covered their ears with both arms, and I escaped between two of them. My ears were ringing for a few minutes after that though, but I guess I'd rather have that than get punched or something, back then, at least.  You could also watch many kung-fu films and try to learn their moves. May I suggest watching The Matrix Trilogy a couple times and studying Neo's moves? (Especially after he becomes "The One".)   --------------------------------------------- By the way, I've never been mugged as of yet, but the ideas above are what I would most likely carry out if I were mugged. Hopefully I won't even get mugged, but who knows. :|

       I am trying to kill a mosquito in my room, but the bastard is being a coward and not showing up. Show yourself and fight like a man!!.. I mean like a mosquito, err.. just show yourself.  On an irrelevant side note, I am glad there is no, or at least I don't see a  urlLink snake in my pants .

       May I kindly direct your attention to my brand new "Winamp" section on the right?  I had done a nowplaying script long ago, and I have finally figured a good use for it, right here. Since I can't use .php right here, I made it load javascript generated by a php on the server, so it's like the same thing.  Dynamic content, baby!

       I'm watching some documentary about vision, and they just said that if you're in front of a cobra and stay still, you will become invisible to it, since the sensor cells in their eyes get tired after a while of no movement, and therefore you become no longer noticed by their eyes for as long as you stay still. This is good to know since most cobras would rather run away than attack you, and will only attack if they feel they are in danger. So, if you ever see one, you better keep still, motherfucker.  Another odd fact they said is that lobsters can only see in 12 colours. (Didn't the Atari or some silly game console have a similar number of colours back in the day?)

       I finally submitted all that stuff...  Some photos: -  urlLink Fluffy  (clouds) series -- 4 pics. -  urlLink Strawberry Fields Forever  (shot in Liverpool)  Some sculptures: -  urlLink Taking the line for a walk...  · (A dog, lol)  urlLink Fist Of Power  · (My fist.)  urlLink chicken  · (It's a chicken, really!)  I also submitted a  urlLink Beetle resource PNG  for others to use in their deviations if they want to.  Lastly, I resubmitted these two old photos because they had been deleted due to a category/section misplacement: -  urlLink Valentine - 01 - Oh!  -  urlLink Valentine - 03 - Hmmm...   Do you like my deviations? (I'd appreciate if you could either comment on them on devart, or else on this post.) :)

       I just got done preparing some photos I took during my flight to Liverpool sometime ago. I'm gonna title them the "fluffy" series. (The clouds look so nice, clean, white and fluffy!) heh  I'm gonna wait until like 3am to post them on devart since at that time is usually when they have the most users browsing, and it's a lot more likely that I'll get comments if I post them then rather than now.

       I just finished watching  urlLink Monty Python's Life of Brian . It's pretty good. (IMDb rates it a 8/10.)  I've never watched much of Monty Python's work. (Well, in fact, none at all, but I've seen the main actor appear in a couple more recent movies.) I read somewhere that apparently  urlLink Life of Brian  is said to be one of the funniest of their movies, and I must say it IS pretty hilarious. I've also heard  urlLink Monty Python and the Holy Grail  is excellent, and I'm guessing it is since IMDB rates it an 8.4/10.

       The English Language exams went fine. Thanks to any who wished me good luck. :P

       Ok, so this is my first post ever on a blog. Here goes a very long rant...  (I have organized my life overview into different interview-like sections to aid my train of thought.)  My name is Alan. I live in Spain though I wasn't born there. I'm 16, if you care to know.     My education?   I've always been to English schools all my life, which explains my English skills. The UK educational system rules by the way. Anyway, I'm in what they call "Year 12". I forgot what's the first year. (Six, I think.) Year 13 is the one before I go to uni. I have finished my Year 12 and am in a period of exams for this and next month. (That reminds me, I have an English Language exam coming up on Tuesday and should probably study instead of writing this.) The subjects I chose were (in no particular order) English Language, Art, IT, Biology. Although I'm not a bad student, my previous year's results weren't too good -- mostly C`s. The choice of subjects was a little tough because the rule was that a student only fails the year if he fails over 4 subjects (which is crazy) and can only enter into subjects next year if he has a B or higher. I only had one B and one A (in Spanish, which is excruciatingly boring to study as it's my native tongue), but I also hadn't failed enough subjects to get kicked out, so they made an exception. It turns out that GCSE/IGCSE grades aren't required to enter into AS level, and is merely a matter of the school, or should I say, the teachers. I got accepted into the subjects I liked which I had previously done. The only one I hadn't done before, which I asked to get into, was Art (and it's quite fun, I must add). (I've done pretty damn good on Art. More on that later.) Hopefully I'll pass this year and get into the next, and hopefully do very good on that, then get into a cool uni. (...And FINALLY the moment I have long dreamed, the moment I would no longer have some stupid homework to do would become true!) If you didn't know already, I  loathe  homework. I think whoever came up with the concept should die, that is, if he/she isn't dead already. Then there's coursework, which I understand, but I hate doing anyway.     My childhood?   I was born in Argentina, 20 days later went with my family to Brazil, then many years later, to the north of Spain, then a few years later, the South. My native tongue is Spanish, and I used to speak Portuguese (but I no longer do 'cause I forgot it from not using it -- I can merely read it or hear it now).     My interests?   I'm very into computer-related stuff. I've been crazy about them since young, and got my first computer back in 1995; a good ol' Pentium1 at 133Mhz running Win9x. I got internet like a year later. I loved it. I remember my first days of having an internet connection I was overwhelmed by the countless questions I could find an answer for. (Oh yea, forgot to mention, I've always been a very curious person. I like to know how everything works.) Back to what I was saying, I have computer-related interests such as (in no particular order) web design, some graphic design/manipulation, scripting (I love scripting!), some animation, a little programming, knowing how (almost) everything works and some more stuff I don't recall at the moment.  Then there's also my "real world" interests, again in no particular order: sculpture (especially wire and found objects), drawing, poetry, paranormal stuff (preferably the non-scary kind like psychic abilities, and sometimes UFOs), watching films (usually special-effects-intensive (though I don't watch them just for the explosions), sci-fi, CG (go Pixar!) or comedy - and very rarely drama), and I was kind of a writer when young, and would probably still be if I came up with an excellent storyline idea.  I am almost always busy (in the sense that I always have some project of mine that I'd like to get done), and if I have a computer and an internet connection, I am rarely ever bored. One of my main personal projects at the moment is a (web)comic strip I have intention of one day running weekly if not daily. I've been working in random spots of my free time in the last year or so on it. I have numerous sketches, and recently reached the milestone of 200 gags in my list of "gags for strips that I will draw/make someday". It features an ostrich named Ralph. You can see one of my latest sketches on  urlLink my site  in the form of a cheap 'coming soon' page. I know it's near to impossible, but I'd love if one day the comic strip were to become famous and if I could live off it that would be awesome! Ever actually considered what a GREAT job comic-strip cartoonists who live off their strips have? It takes from 10 to 20 minutes at most, everyday, and you can work in advance if you wanna/can. Some who do this which I admire are Jim Davis (Garfield) and Scott Adams (Dilbert). They essentially become rich from a 15 minute daily job. How f*****g awesome is that? And at the same time, so rare and improbable, but hey, I can fantasize, can't I?     What do I usually do when I'm on the computer?   I am either messing with PHP to make useless gadgets (one in my list is a WAP interface to posting on Blogger, but I'll only make it if I start liking this thing called blogging), chatting on IRC, working on my comic strip, working on its website, browsing  urlLink Slashdot  and  urlLink DeviantArt , doing some nifty wire/metal sculptures,  and some other stuff. I'm also always listening (and often singing along) to my dear Winamp5. You can see what I'm currently listening  urlLink here  thanks to a PHP script I recently wrote. Still needs some work though.    And when I'm not on the computer?   I'm most likely taking walks on the beach, or going to capoeira (some Brazilian martial arts) lessons. Or doing sculptures, though I mentioned that earlier.     What are my career desires?   I would love to do special fx for big Hollywood movies, and if that weren't possible, I would like to get into 3D animation (and modeling, I suppose). The downfall to the first choice is that there is like no frikin' uni that teaches it correctly. If I'm successful at some point, you shall hopefully see my name in the credits of some big movie.     How do I feel at the moment?   Well, I wish I had a girlfriend. I'm don't consider myself ugly. (I'm also not anorexic or obese, extremely weak, full of acne, or dress in Star-Trek suits and speaking fluent Klingon, so I don't consider myself "socially repulsive".) I don't drink, smoke, or take drugs though, and some people don't seem to like that, but fuck it. I have rarely found my type of girl, and when I have, I've ended up with a simple negative response. (Yes, I've never had a girlfriend, though I tried.) (First there was a "No", then a "Yes, if only I didn't already have a boyfriend", and another "No".) Hopefully I'll find someone eventually, and soon. There was one time when there was a confusion and I thought I actually had a girlfriend. It lasted a week. I must say that week felt great. Nevermind my broken heart when I found out there had been a confusion. Oh well, life can suck at times, but like that saying says "There's always more fish in the ocean!".  Besides my inexistent lovelife, right now I feel relieved to finally get some sort of holiday sort of thing, though I have very important exams. (One coming up this Tuesday.)     What do I listen to?   I listen to my definition of "good music". I don't usually listen to mainstream music (like pop crap); I'll tell you that much. Check  urlLink my profile  for some of my favourite artists/bands.     Where can you see my artwork?   I am a member of DeviantArt and you may see my  urlLink main page  and  urlLink my photography  (includes photos of my sculptures and stuff). You may also find one of my latest Ralph sketches on its 'coming soon' page on  urlLink my site . -- Eventually there'll be a proper full site with an actual weekly/daily comic strip going on.     Any last words before hitting "Publish Post"?   Jesus, did I really write this much!?  PS: Enjoy my rant! :P

       The other day I tried GetMail, which I previously suggested as a good tool for transferring Hotmail to Gmail, but neither me nor a friend of mine could get the damn thing working. Today, I found a substitute, after reading on  urlLink Google cache , which is fool-proof and works a lot better, in my opinion.  It's  urlLink FastMail.fm . (Gmail is still way cooler than FastMail.fm btw.)  Anyway, you simply sign up for a fastmail.fm account, then go to the Options page, then set up your Hotmail account in the "POP/Hotmail Links" section, then go to your Mailbox page, then in the list of actions to perform, look for 'check pop links', and once you do that, it'll import all Hotmail mail on your Inbox. Once it's imported, select it all, and go in the list of actions again and look for "Redirect to people", then type in your Gmail address.  Don't forget that it only imports the Inbox, and therefore does not import any Hotmail subfolders you may have, so if you want to import all your mail, put it all in the Inbox.  Oh, and don't forget to "label" all your Hotmail mail with a "hotmail" label or something. Don't forget mail can have as many labels as you want it to have.  Good luck. ;)

         urlLink eMessenger    Do you have an old phone whose Internet support is just WAP, and envy those fancy new phones that have a little version of MSN Messenger built in? Worry no more, you too can now get on MSN, via  urlLink WAP . (Or if you  do  have one of those fancy new phones that support small images and basic html, use  urlLink this .)  Has your school/college/uni/library/whatever blocked MSN Messenger? Then maybe you'll be interested in the normal version  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and  urlLink here .

       I'm working on a web-based CLI (CommandLine Interface) for myself. It requires a lot of JavaScript, and I'm not a guru at it, so it's pretty hard, but I'm slowly managing. I spent all of yesterday going nuts over a stupid function to scroll a "div" (with "overflow:auto;") to the bottom, and in the end it turned out to be the stupidest thing imaginable... I had forgotten to set an id attribute on the div. When I did, it started working.  A few minutes ago I got the XML stuff out of the way. (I refuse to refresh the page for new content as I want a buffer-like textbox that keeps filling up until I decide to close the window, so I'm using JavaScript's ways of loading external xml files to load php-generated xml that is the output for the command sent.) Now, the last thing I want that involves JS is that my OK button shows a small one-character animation while the request is being sent to the server.  The bright side of all this hassle is that I'm learning JS to a higher extent than before.  Oh, and God bless Google's search engine. (It always finds me snippets that I can work from, hehe.)

       This is a real story. I'm not in love with this girl I met, but I still made a friend, and that's better than nothing. Here's the story:  Two days ago, there was some nice girl I didn't know sitting on the edge of my swimming pool. I'm always a pussy when it comes to talking to complete female strangers for the sake of starting a conversation, but... I went down to the pool, and she was alone. I walked down to where she was, feeling like a pussy 'cause I wasn't sure if she'd like talking with me or not, but I thought "What's the worse that can happen?", so I sat down and greeted her. It turns out she was waiting for some drunk friends who weren't showing up (who showed up like 3 hours later). Meanwhile we talked and I gave her some company to fight boredom. She wasn'ts breathtakingly-hot, but she wasn't bad. She was Irish, 20 years old (though she looked like 18) and just finished university. She seemed very friendly.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moral of this story is:  Quit being a pussy and use " the direct approach " to start a conversation with whoever you love/fancy, or whoever you feel attracted to. And like Nike says,   Just do it.       (I dedicate this post in particular to a certain online friend. You know who you are.)

       Tomorrow I'm spending most of the day in Morocco for a charity orphanage thing organized by my school. It was either that or going to lessons, so I chose doing it. Hopefully nothing bad will happen. (You'll known if I suddenly stop blogging, lol.)

       Quite a long time ago I partially downloaded a Donald Duck cartoon, but it wasn't your average cartoon, since Donald was a member of the Nazi army. Yes, you heard me right, he worshipped Hitler and worked at a Nazi ammunition factory. This cartoon (from 1942) is called " urlLink Der Fuehrer's Face " (which was later renamed to "Donald Und Nazi Land" or something like that).     Since I had it partially downloaded, I never got to see the end, until I read about it on a  urlLink very nice review . In the end, it turns out he was just having a bad dream, and he ends up kissing a little statue of liberty, proclaiming his love for America. But you see, if you don't get to see the ending, you would've thought Walt Disney was a nazi, like I did at first. heh.  You may also know that recently Donald  urlLink turned 70 , and as expected, celebrated it on Disneyworlds around the world. There is also another interesting article regarding Donald and politics, where it apparently says that in Sweden,  urlLink there is a Donald Duck Party , that although never gets most votes, it still often gets more votes than parties for living breathing people. We're speaking of a cartoon duck here, so even a few hundred votes is still something. (Odd, but something.)

       No, not me. It's someone else, as according to a certain news site, a uni student named David Vardy  urlLink auctioned his virginity  on the internet. I wonder if he'll buy  urlLink this shirt  anytime soon.

       Two days ago it was reported that David Bowie, during his concert in Norway, while he was singing, some guy in the crowd threw a lollipop at him, and got him  urlLink right in his left eye . Ouch! That's gotta hurt.  Kinda gives a whole new meaning to "eye candy", doesn't it?  (Though I probably shouldn't be making fun of this, seeing as it must really hurt a lot. heh)

       Who would want boobs like  urlLink these ? I have no idea. (A friend adds " Reason #1 why you should have yeast infections treated quickly. ")  Or maybe you'd like to try the  urlLink best toilet ever . This reminds me of some Japanese video I saw sometime ago where a couple went around naked in a big box made of the same type of glass, having sex while someone carried the box around the streets of the city. It was quite amusing.  Now can someone tell me why would anyone EVER want to keep Rasputin's penis in a jar? Or worse,  urlLink to exhibit it on a museum !? --- " Oh, Bob, could you chop his penis off for me? I wanna keep it in a jar with some neon lights on the side; it could do for a unique case-mod, and then eventually I can sell the penis on eBay, or to a museum. "

       I watched   Harry Potter 3   ( urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ). I really enjoyed it. It had an unexpected twist in the end, and it's one of those that once you watch the ending it makes you go "ah! so that's why   did   when   happened", and that's always fun. The special effects were amazing, and the score is  AWESOME , and done by my favourite composer, the amazing  urlLink John Williams . The only thing I despise slightly is the voice that dubbed Ron (in the Spanish dub which I watched since I am in Spain), but hey, Spain's to blame for that, not the guys that made the movie.  I enjoyed this third movie a lot more than the previous one in the saga,  urlLink Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , and I thought it was a lot more action-packed and more fast-paced than the first one,  urlLink Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , though the first still has the original Potter "magic".  I recommend everyone who liked the other Harry Potter movies to watch Harry Potter 3. I thought it was quite worth watching. ;)

       According to  urlLink BCC UK  you can now get surfboards with a computer and wifi internet access. ( urlLink slashdot .) ------ So Bob got on the board, and surfed the Australian waves. It was not long before he was unfortunate enough to meet a beast with several rows of sharp teeth. He promptly snapped into action, accessing Google from his surfboard, only to find Google has no proper results for "  urlLink emergency shark evasion tactics  ". The shark was quite happy about this, seeing as he was hungry AND needed a new mp3 player.  Coming soon, law sharks sue sharks for copyright infringement. Google to release "Google Surfbar", too.

        urlLink CNET  reported that  urlLink Hotmail  was bouncing  urlLink Gmail  invites, but I've invited a friend, and he had no trouble. Other people apparently had other types of problems whereby clicking the link in Hotmail rather than copying the url to your browser allowed Hotmail to sabotage you and  urlLink not make the link work ; but I don't know if that's what they're actually doing or whatever.

       You can now access Gmail via pop3 using a program called "  urlLink POP Goes The Gmail  ".  I don't see why anyone would want to use pop3 to get their Gmail mail, seeing how incredibly awesome the webmail GUI is. Nonetheless, there's still a good use for it.  You can use it in conjunction with a "new email notifier", or include it in a  urlLink Samurize  config  (which is what I intend on doing).

        urlLink Slashdot  reported two days ago about  urlLink The University of Tokyo  developing a technology that would allow for invisible cloaks and translucent walls. The technique they use for the cloaks they call "optic camouflage". (There's demonstration videos on the page. Check 'em out. They're pretty cool.)  Slashdot says:  The inventor's next objective is to make  urlLink walls that are invisible , using the same technology.  Shit, I thought  clean glass  was already pretty invisible. Moreover, not so long ago, glasses that have no reflections were invented. In my opinion, a mix of both would give a fairly decent transparent wall.  Also worthy of mention is  urlLink SmartGlass , which is able to go from transparent to opaque with a controlled electric current.

Who needs a zillion bots when you have 200Mbps DSL? That's what the future seems like. Anyway, for us good (non-packet-kiddie) people, it will be very nice to have such speedy connections.    And coming soon, intercontinental travel at the speed of light! So fast you'll have to lose your baggage beforehand.

       I knew that  urlLink Orkut  was from Google, but I never realised it was hosted by them AND was result of their famous policy of giving their employees 20% of their work time to work on  urlLink personal projects . Hosting an employee's project; how nice of 'em. :) (Oh, and in case you were wondering what the hell Orkut  urlLink is .)   -*Update*-  I found  urlLink this article , and I quote:  Orkut means "to cum" in Finnish, although we don't know if Mr and Mrs Buyukkokten, who are Turkish, knew that at the time they christened their son. Perhaps the choice of Orkut, and the orgasmic name, are a sophisticated joke by the management.    (Go Google! you rock!)

       I was trying out earlier a game called  urlLink Gish . I'd recommend you check out  urlLink the demo . (It's 8Mb.)  You're basically a disgruntled blob of tar who seeks to get his girlfriend back. You go around and all you can do is stick, or become heavy, or slimey and jump (of course). It sounds too simple, but this game is so much fun to play. I have already played the demo like 12 times.

       Yesterday I watched the  WORST  movie I've  ever  seen  in my entire life .  I watched " urlLink Starship Troopers 2 ". I downloaded it to see how it was. I never really liked the first movie, but it was amusing. Everyone told me the sequel sucked balls, and damn right they were.     Someone must've made a typo. I'm quite certain this movie's called "Starshit Poopers 2". What's up with the cover anyway? It looks like a terrible Photoshop job, and don't get me started on the people's [sarcasm]hyper-realistic[/sarcasm] facial expressions.  And I thought " Elf " was bad, HA! To make a comparison... this movie makes  urlLink Elf  seem like it had the quality of the goddamn StarWars trilogy (the first trilogy). I'm not kidding you. This is most certainly...  THE WORST MOVIE EVER FUCKING MADE IN THE FUCKING HISTORY OF FUCKING SCIFI FILMOGRAPHY!!!   There are many things I want to mock, err.. tell the world about this movie, let's see...  -  No plot/storyline at all.  This is the story: There's war between humans and bugs on some planet, there's like a group of eight or so soldiers left, and they decide to run and hide in a big bunker building. Then they stay there, not coming out for the whole film. Some aliens infect some of the humans and use them as hosts. Once infected, they're. I really mean, there is zero plotline, mediocre character development.  - The whole movie is filmed with a Sony handycam. You can tell from the video image quality, the feel of the movie's framerate, its responsiveness to blinking lights, and lastly, from the big "SONY Motion Pictures Systems" logo they put at the end of the credits. (Systems my ass! It was a frikin' handycam!!)  - Shitty acting. Cheesy dialogues.  - It is not just filmed with a handycam, it is also filmed without a stand, therefore the image is shakey during the whole film.  - The whole movie occurs in really dark places to hide the shitty sets.  - At one point, you see a bug's leg dead, stabbed into some thing, from like a previous battle. It looks like made of shitty spray-painted plastic. I've seen fake rubber croissants which looked way more realistic than that insect leg prop.  - The CG is shit. The lighting of the insects and their textures are especially craptastic.  - They couldn't even get the thunderstorm effects right... There is a storm while they're outside, and each time there's lightning, there is a very very faint flash on the people. This was clearly some cheap lights as proper lightning effects use these special lights that shine like hell, like they were a huge flash. The ones in this movie were most likely shitty lights, judging by the very faint light they gave away.  - A guy gets a huge spear, close to the diameter of your fist, right through his chest, and he screams like a total and absolute pussy. (Did I mention that if you get a huge spear through your lungs you can't actually scream? Apparently the suppernatural, puny human here could.) He also prolongued the scream quite a lot. Hell, if you got a huge spear through your chest, you'd die pretty quick.  - There was more pussy screaming after that. Even the exaggerated kind of an unnaturally-prolongated "...AAaaAaAAAaaaaAaAa...". -- Considering how shit that guy's wounds makeup was, it seemed like the guy had gone into an Italian restaurant, ordered pasta with tomato sauce, and rubbed it on random sides of his face.  - 21 minutes into the movie, I was still wondering what the plot was. Little did I know that by the time the movie ended, I found out there was no actual plot.  - They have a super-realistic radar screen, which apparently is able to detect bugs from anything else, judging by the fact that instead of the usual glowing green dots moving on the screen, there were little cockroach-like bug icons roaming around the radar screen. I guess it was too hard to try and not spoil the only realistic thing in the whole damn movie by changing the dots to bulky bug icons (that can even change direction, as if the radar could tell if one of the bugs turned 90º to its side or not). They should've called it the bugdar.  - The explosions were CG 'cause they couldn't afford a few explosives. The explosions were total and utter crap. They looked super fake. I've seen better rendered explosions in Discovery Channel programmes.  - The weapons have zero backwards thrust when they shoot, or the actors forgot to act like they did. I mean come on, any respectable weapon has at least a little backwards push when it fires something. - And when they fire, guess what the firing looks like... yes, you guessed it, a little flashing light. (A little LED light, I think.) The guns don't do anything when they are fired. They just flash that stupid light. - And also have unlimitted ammo for some reason. (There is not a scene in the whole movie where someone "recharges" his/her weapon somehow.) - And they are huge and bulky and shoot tiny bullets regardless of wether they're a handgun, or nearly the length of a bazooka. They all shoot sissy bullets. There's like some humungus shotgun that is close to the size of a bazooka and shoots bullets comparable to a simple handgun, WITH a small flashing LED bulb.  - The score doesn't match the movie, and judging by how it sounds, it's a very tiny orchestra... probably less than 12 members. - The sound-editing person was a moron. The voices were wayyyyyy louder than the soundtrack, to the point you don't feel the soundtrack at all.  - There is a shot in the kitchen where the camera moves around a table. The camera man is so bad that you can notice the man walking from the camera's shaking.  - At one point in the movie, two cables got run over, and the whole building gets a powercut and shuts down. May I remind you this is in the future, like 2035, and this building is very strong and hi-tech, and supposed to be a bunker (so there should be emergency systems), yet two mere cables being run over is enough to shut the whole building down? What is this, don't humans know about electricity management in the future?  - They had one night-vision binoculars thingy. The end of it had only one central lens, to appear to be modern. But the actual lens isn't a lens, it is a piece of green plastic, with a light behind it. It's funny when the actors pick it up and do like they're seeing something.  - I was 47 minutes into the movie and like I said before, still wondering what the fuck the plot is. I'm still wondering it now. Oh wait, there isn't one.  - It has such a SHIT ending.  - The blood effects were absolutely crap.  - In one scene, a woman gets hit on her head really badly by a huge object, and a powerful squirt of blood goes on the glass window, then she falls to the ground unconscious, but her head shows no signs of being hit. Not even a cut.  - The camera panning is so cheap. It's clearly a guy holding the handycam and turning it around.  - This movie is classified as Scifi Horror, but it's so terribly shit, that the genre is more like Comedy. It's like watching the Dalek robot movies. Those movies were supposed to be scary back then, but now you watch it and it's like it were "the invasion of the large rolling trash-cans with a long immobile probes that shoot smoke, who interact with human-sounding monotonous voices, even with each other". (Why would robots from outer space talk to each other with voice? They can build an enormous UFO, but not a wireless network?) -- Anyway, this blog post is about starshit troopers 2, not the dalek robots, so back to what I was saying...  - At one point, there's a Blade cliche when one of the infected humans attacks this other guy. The guy attacking has full red eyes, Blade-style. The scene's pretty badly acted though.  - oh no, a shitty CG scorpion-cockroach is attacking a black man in his white boxers underwear! ...and one of the guys that is on the floor is making what appears to be orgasm sounds which were supposed to be moans of fear or pain as a number of spiders crawled over him, biting and stuff.  - Near the end there's a pretty shitty spaceshit, err spaceship, probably done as fast as possible in 3dsmax.  - Oh noe, it's action man! -- after the spaceship, a guy jumps out, with two large machine guns, and shoots some bugs or something. Gotta love his shitty neutral facial expression. (Even Terminator had more expression.)  - Near the end, there's one of the guys who is now wearing a robot arm, or more like a large glove. It's very clearly a shitty plastic glove. Did they find it at Toys'R'Us? ...and nice hologram sticker that you stuck on a side of it. Adds a nice touch of mediocrity to the overflowing sack of shit that is this movie.  - Everything in this movie is predictable. Let's put an example... In one scene, a hot naked woman tempts a soldier to come to a shadowy corner. Yes, you guessed it, she's evil due to being infected by the bugs. (This is a very cheesy scene by the way.) Then, guess what she has smeared on her chest, yep, you guessed it, blood. Now guess what's gonna happen... damn, you got it again, the other infected soldiers are surrounding their victim, and while the victim argues in fear, guess what, yep, you're right, someone comes from behind and grabs him.   - Now that I mention the blood effects in the movie... it was really shitty fake blood. It looked like red paint. Actual real blood has a much darker colour, and stains a hell of a lot more than their stupid red dyes.  - In the scene with the naked woman I mentioned a minute ago, the evil man that walks behind the victim decides to cut the guy's throat with a knife. The camera shows us how they cut him, and there is a very tiny amount of blood that comes out of the wound, and then no more blood comes out, while in real life, there would be a HUGE bloodflow and some really disturbing screaming.  - There was a fight scene where some woman starts beating up some infected soldiers, and it's so badly crafted. A few seconds afterwards, it becomes what looks like a cheesy rape scene, then one evil guy stabs a knife on her throat. Of course, the blood looked as realistic as ketchup on some McDonalds fries.  - All bugs can produce screeching sounds, no matter what size. Of course, it would be too hard for the writer of the screenplay (if there's even an actual writer), to realise that no organism can make sounds without some vocal cords.  - In one scene, one of the infected people cuts off someone's head, and it looks like a shitty rubber head. I've seen Halloween masks which looked more realistic.  - In another scene, some bug comes out of one of the dead infected people, out of her head. Her head was full of what I could best describe as strawberry jell-o and some guts of some animal, probably a sheep's intestine, bought at the local meat shop. There is no sight of an actual brain anywhere. Not a trace of it.  - In another scene, an infected woman is set on fire in some closed chamber. Within a second, you see a CG of her, absolutely burnt, with a cartoon-like carbon effect, and yet, still screaming in pain. (Oh, and her eyes magically did not get burned at all, while the rest of her body is all black and burnt. I guess they needed some eyes for us to realise that was her and not some plank of burning wood.) Again, the screaming is very faint. I'm quite certain that if you're being burnt alive you should scream pretty loud.  - What some people said about it: "  When I saw the first 5 minutes I thought that it was fake Because the camera sucked  "  "  THE WHOLE FUCKING FILM SUCKED after 45m i turned it off and complained to blockbuster for even putting it on the shelve and u wanna know what was even more worse? i picked up once apon a time in mexico then saw ST2 on the shelf so i put back once apon a time and picked up ST2 then i got it home and i was like is this a preview or something then it was the whole film i thought actually that some 1 made there own version and stuck the dvd in the case  "  "  I watched it and thought I could have had more of an enjoying time sticking my penis in a light socket.  "  "  If anyone ever asks me what is the worst movie you have ever seen.. I don't think I will even need to think about it..  "  "  I want a screenshot of the scene with the black man on his tight, white boxer shorts, slapping the bugs. That is priceless.  "  - This is pretty funny... at the end of the credits, they put " The characters and incidents portrayed and the names herein are fictitious, blah blah blah... " OH REALLY!??!! I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL BASED ON A REAL STORY!!!   - I'd like to quote a  urlLink post  on IMDb.com:  Before the movie started, director Phil Tippett walked out to address the audience (which filled less than 1/4 of the seats). He basically came out to apologize for what we were about to witness. He explained that the studio wanted to keep the Starship Troopers franchise alive, so the picture we were about to view was created. I believe he quoted the budget for the original film to be $140 million. The budget for ST2: $6 million. Do the math.   I do think, however, that with $6 million I could've done a much better movie. And isn't it funny how the actual director apologizes for his creation? I've never heard of that happening before.  I'm thinking I may or may not get some screen captures of the movie to illustrate my review, sometime in the next week or something. I'll let you know if I ever upload some pics.

       Apparently, since 1992, chewing gum has been banned in Singapore. But  urlLink not anymore ... well, sort of. They're allowing medicinal-type gum. -- (anyway, what's up with the picture on the article page? It's beyond me how a man with what looks like a bone, picking his filthy yellow teeth with it, have to do with chewing gum. In fact, from the picture, all I can gather is that Singaporeans need some serious dental care.)  And if a ban on chewing gum wasn't enough, it is in fact, also illegal. I quote:   "Anyone found dealing gum illegally will face up to two years in jail."   (Jesus christ, these must be truly dangerous individuals!)  I can already picture the setting... a man laid on the wall looks suspiciously at an individual and says " Want bubbles? ", then they go to a dark alley and deal bubblegum, and the dealer gets like 50 bucks off the sale. (well, in the Singaporean equivalent.)  Imagine an employer doing a background search on you and finding that you have a criminal record, with just one entry saying " Guilty of dealing bubblegum in Singapore ". haha!  And that's not all. IF you do want to chew gum, you need to get a  urlLink license .    Coming soon to your nearest cinemas... the new Bond movie... "Mission in Singapore: License to Chew"

       For a great company, all you need is 1,900  urlLink geniuses .    The company's employees include a former rocket scientist and a former brain surgeon.  Microsoft has 56,000 employees, but its research group, with 700, is separate. Google has 1,900 employees, and no separate research group, so all 1,900, effectively, are charged to "boldly go where no one has gone before" (its words).    They also get 20% of their work time for working on projects of their own, which is why they innovate so much.

       "The Illiad", one of the best works in European literature, has been  urlLink cut back for the "text generation"  (or should i say "txt genrtion") by Microsoft in an attempt to make it more accessible for teenagers.   ` The "translation" of the first five of the 24 Iliad books condenses 37,000 words to 32 lines of mobile telephone text message language, with sad and smiley faces and love hearts. ´   I think they're fucking retarded.  Funnily enough, Microsoft appears to have removed  urlLink the page , but luckily, our big friend Google has it  urlLink cached . It's hilarious. (I've also just saved it for future laughs.) Oh, and here's an official Microsoft  urlLink press release  on it.  Some Microsoft employee needs to lay off the drugs.

       Australian News.com reports that the spectacle that is the transit of Venus is  urlLink too dangerous .  I quote:    The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) and the Optometrists Association Australia warned that directly viewing the sun for the event placed observers at risk of having a hole burnt in the retina, which could lead to permanent blindness.      Remember you can always grab your digital camera and watch the eclipse by looking at the LCD. I hear there'll be also live webcasts of the transit.

       Reversing music can sometimes reveal freaky things, like Queen's " urlLink It's fun to smoke marijuana! ", Britney Spears' " urlLink Sleep with me, I'm not too young. " or the most disturbing as of yet... Led Zeppelin's "Stairway To Heaven" which reveals some very freaky  urlLink satanic messages . Even freakier is the fact that it's several verses and seems to make sense, unlike the one-liners from other artists.  There are many more out there which I don't know of. Someone told me once that The Beatles had one song with weird messages too, but I haven't been able to confirm this.

       I just wrote a  urlLink PHP script  that amongst other things gathers your latitude and longitude.

It's not accurate with 100% of IPs, but it often gets them right, or their state right at the very least.  If anyone complains it plotted them wrong, I will have to do like  urlLink these Nigerians  and have you attacked by a domesticated baboon or hyena.

         urlLink Troy    I watched Troy yesterday. It's so fucking long. I don't recommend going to the cinema to watch it, but I recommend you watch it somehow (you know what i mean, tsk tsk), just for the fight scenes, for they were pretty neat. Apparently it is also historically incorrect, too. Nonetheless, it beats Gladiator in terms of nifty duels and barbarian fighting. I thought Achilles was the shit.  The only odd thing that I kept having during the movie was picturing Hector turning into Hulk and stepping on the greeks. (Sorry, but as you may know, Eric Bana was the guy who played Hulk, and since that was where I saw him first, I keep associating him to that movie, which was pretty shitty by the way -- though his acting was fine.)  That's all I gotta say about Troy. (I won't tell you about the trojan hors.. oh shit, sorry for spoiling you a history book.)     urlLink Spy Kids 2    Just watched it. Fun movie. The CG could've been better, but it was still 'okay'. The storyline was fine, and so was the acting. I really liked the scene with the skeletons, which was a clear reference to a battle scene in a very old movie called " urlLink Jason and the Argonauts ".  PS: I thought Antonio Banderas' English pronunciation was a little better. At times he sounds a little bit odd. (Yes, I do know his main language is Spanish.)

         If a person was flying in space at the speed of light (ala Superman) with his/her arm fully outstretched holding a facial mirror, what would they "see" in the mirror? Would they see their face? Would it be bigger or smaller than if they were stationary? Would it be distorted in any way? Would light waves have time to bounce off their face, hit the mirror, and bounce back to their retina which was also moving at the speed of light? And what if an observer was watching all this from the ground. What would he or she see?    I just read that this was the riddle that eventually led Einstein to E=MC 2 .

       (I wrote this on my phone and continued on some paper, after watching Spiderman2, since I had to wait an hour to do something.)  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Just seen  urlLink Spiderman2 ; it was  great ! ...though, do you know what I felt as I watched the ending and credits? I felt lonely. I felt I was the only human in the whole cinema not knowing what a kiss (on the lips) feels like, and I'm most certain I'm not wrong in that assumption. I look around and everyone's a couple. All but me.  I am tired of being alone, of not knowing what a kiss feels like, or even a passionate hug from your special other. (Sex too, but there's no rush for that.) In shorter words, I  have  loved I have not  been  loved (by a member of the opposite sex and similar age to me). I wanna experience the physical implications of this thing they call "love"; this drug; this mysterious force by which mankind runs on, seeks ...and eventually finds. This sometimes stupid, but essential emotion that makes life have a meaning; that makes it worthwhile. What is life? Why am I here? Why, why, WHY!!?! I'll tell you why. I was brought to this world as a product of this emotion which I seek. I think I'm here to change the world, even if it's just a little not much, just a little dent, it's still something. Often small things can make quite a difference, but I cannot live without this strange fuel I am lacking; the fuel that would give my life a purpose, a meaning, a reason to exist, a reason to  be .  And why is this not a suicide note? That's because I have not yet lost hope. I know out there there has to be  someone  for me. Some girl who would listen to me, care about me,  love me .  I seek love, and I swear to God I will find it. I am tired of being a fucking pussy. I am tired of being alone. I am somewhat hurt and tired of the world, but I will not lose hope, for one day I'll find love.  One day she'll be mine ,  whoever she may be.

       I watched the first ep of season 2 of  urlLink Dead Like Me  (which btw premieres on Sunday July 25th), which is titled "Send In The Clown". The episode continued right where they left from. I am glad that the show is still great. :)

       The guy that teaches it seems to know what he's doing, and is friendly, so I think the course isn't bad. I'll keep you (the unexistant audience) updated.

       ...they'd be a hell of a criminal mastermind. Ever come to think of it?  All those scriptwriters who work on those clever murder movies, or CSI ( urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2  and  urlLink 3 ).  Thank god they're not criminals. *phew*

        urlLink Slashdot  reported  urlLink an article  from  urlLink Slate  (which is part of MSN which is owned by Microsoft), saying  urlLink Mozilla Firefox  is better than Internet Explorer.  I can already hear Bill Gates firing that Paul Boutin writer for creating that article, lol.

       The other day I noticed two odd "blogs of note"...   urlLink bo logh , a blog written entirely in Klingon. (I wonder if  he  she also uses Google  urlLink in that language .)  And the other is  urlLink Terminal Island , which, as the name implies, is a terminal. Probably the most original blog design I've seen to date, even though the terminal concept could get annoying after some time. Nonetheless, you gotta admit it's still pretty damn original for being a blog design.

       I've been reading " urlLink The Dilbert Principle " by  urlLink Scott Adams , and I think it's great! It's clever, true and hilarious at the same time.  In case you don't know who  urlLink Scott Adams  is, he is the creator of the famous daily comic-strip  urlLink Dilbert .

       Do you know what  urlLink they are ?  Here's an example:  A man, a plan, a canoe, pasta, heros, rajahs, a coloratura, maps, snipe, percale, macaroni, a gag, a banana bag, a tan, a tag, a banana bag again (or a camel), a crepe, pins, Spam, a rut, a Rolo, cash, a jar, sore hats, a peon, a canal -- Panama!  (The letters in the sentence above can be read forwards AND backwards equally.)  The  urlLink Google Blog  mentioned that a certain employee of theirs wrote a program to  urlLink beat the record  on the world's longest palindrome. The  urlLink latest  version involves 17,259 words.  Here's  urlLink some other  palindromes.

        urlLink jark  is the main guy at  urlLink DeviantArt  (awesome art site that you should know about if you don't already). He claims to be a yellow alien with a green anal probe stick.    For some strange reason, he appears in episode 9 from the 7th season of  urlLink The Simpsons .  At one point, the army is checking every room in some base, and at one point they open one door, and a little yellow alien (with the stereotypical grey-style eyes and looks) with a glowing green probe stick. (...just like jark!)  As the door opens and the soldiers notice the alien, the alien turns to the light coming from the door, with an angry face and holding the green probe stick, and a guy shouts something like "Oh no, he's got the probe!" and they quickly close the door.

       The other day I went to the cinema to watch  urlLink Shrek 2 . I thought it was great!! The  urlLink cast  of voices was excellent too.  It's full of references to various elements from movies including but not limited to (and in no particular order): Spiderman, Peter Pan (hook and tinkerbell references), Mission Impossible, two characters from Beauty and The Beast, The Little Mermaid, COPS (ok, not a movie, but whatever), Godzilla, El Zorro, Alien, Lord of the Rings, Sleepy Hollow, Jurassic Park, and probably more which I don't recall. (I haven't really spoiled you anything yet, since I haven't told you what the actual references are.) There's  urlLink soooooo many .  It's also slightly musical, as it includes musical songs from the  Fairy Godmother  ( urlLink Jennifer Saunders ) and  Donkey  ( urlLink Eddie Murphy ) with  Puss In Boots  ( urlLink Antonio Banderas ). Also, Tom Waits, disguised as a character I shant mention for the sake of not spoiling it for you, sings songs in a bar in the movie.  Actually, now that I think of it, I wonder if  Shrek 2  is the first CG movie to ever feature a musical scene (where the characters sing themselves and stuff).  There's also a number of gags involving the  urlLink store names , such as a "Burger Prince".  Oh, by the way, if you go see it, when the credits start, stay on your seat, 'cause there's an extra bit featuring Donkey. (If I gave any more info I would spoil it for you.)  Lastly, seeing how well the animation was done, I look forward to seeing PDI-DreamWorks' next CG film,  urlLink Shark Tale  (also featuring a great cast of voices). Oh yea, I suppose you know DreamWorks is owned by  urlLink Spielberg ?

       I've been watching following  urlLink Futurama  more and more lately, and have been wondering how they do the animation which is a mix of 2D elements with 3D backgrounds, vehicles and other stuff.  Then I found a  urlLink post  on some forum, where one of the Futurama people (named Scott Vanzo) answered a bunch of questions in a fairly detailed letter. For the sake of archival (in case that forum died), I will paste it here: -----------------------------------------------------------  I agree with mArc's observations regarding the lack of artifacts in 3D animation that cause it to diverge with the quality of the hand-drawn (2D) animation.   Hand-drawn Animation for episodic (television) production is generally animated on 2's(12 fps) for any particular movement. This cost-effective measure introduces temporal artifacts such as strobing and emphasizes video field separation due to the NTSC format and 3:2 field rate conversion(converting 24fps->30fps).  These artifacts are generally considered limitations, so the prevailing attitude among our episode Directors is to use all 24 fps of 3D animation, despite the disparity. IMHO, however - the 12 fps would be my personal preference UNLESS the motion was considerably fast or complex. Even hand-drawn animation is animated on 1's when clarity is needed or a camera pan is in effect. Perhaps a more judicious use of 1's would be more appropriate.  Spatially, a hand-drawn character is often "cheated" to emphasize traits of the face or body - to improve legibility of an expression, recognition of character(through silhouette features), and/or design(composition). The character's features are often drawn slightly out of proportion or off-perspective as a result.  Bender is a good example. His visor is clearly visible in hand-drawn rear 3/4 poses even though his visor is all but occluded by his head in our 3D model. We would have to severely lengthen or warp his visor during a 3D animation in order for it to appear identical to the 2D model. Also, front 3/4 drawings emphasize the frontal features by "pulling" the front of the character more towards the viewer. All of this pushing, pulling and warping that is merely an intuitive impulse/response to the 2D animator would be a logistical nightmare to the 3D animator.  This problem would be interesting to investigate, however. A more procedural way of key-framing these distortions, based on camera movement, may be possible.  Unintended variances in hand-drawn perspective and position are often a trait of even good Animation. The eye is able to "accept" some imprecision without really correcting for it. The movement is believable, even if it isn't incredibly smooth. In the worst case, an object that is drawn very small, or in-betweened poorly may jitter unacceptably.  This is where we could experiment more and still meet our schedule. Perhaps a minute, random offset, rotation, camera angle adjustment could be introduced to each frame to vary the appearance in a subtle way. This would not be too complicated. Worth a test.  3D is used to extend our 2D toolset, so its use is by definition divergent from what we can do with 2D. We therefore limit our 3D animation by making the movement as simple as possible.  Drawn high-lights and shadows on a character or object may be based more on composition than on accurate representation of a "3D" or real-world light source.  In general we "lock" down, or limit the way that lights interact with objects. Usually, it is as simple as grouping a light source with an object, where possible, to reduce the broad movement of shadows or highlights. The light source can move locally, but not globally.  The amount of coverage and softness between shade regions is also considered.  Line thickness and coherence(missing lines or line portions) is an issue for hand-drawn Animation (during the Assistant/Cleanup stage) as well as for the 3D Animation. We've had to learn how to model in 3D to help insure that lines won't jitter or pop on/off during Animation rendering. Our rendering solution(PowerAnimator-> urlLink PowerToon ) was the best product at the time to maintain coherence in lines and still offer a great amount of control. We're still looking for a Maya solution for line rendering that will offer us this kind of quality.  Line quality is another issue. The line renderer we use is good, but creates a uniformly thick line. This is adequate for Futurama, but there are some finer nuances of 2D cleanup that are difficult to emulate, such as rounded corners and soft pencil lines.  Effects (such as smoke, explosions, nebulae) are toned down quite a bit so they don't look too realistic. Many people think that cool looking effects are necessarily realistic-looking; I contend that abstraction can look appropriate, if not "cool", as well. Abstracting effects (reducing local detail/noise, lighting and action) is much more difficult to do well than pursuing a quasi-realistic result. Of course, obtaining convincing realism is a holy grail of sorts, but we have to determine how far we will go and still integrate the style with the hand-drawn. Some shots are more successful than others; Overall, IMHO, we've done pretty good.  -----------   To clarify for anyone curious, we use  urlLink Softimage Toonz  for 2D ink&paint/composite, and  urlLink Alias|Wavefront  PowerAnimator and  urlLink Maya  for 3D...  Any how, sorry for any techno-speak.  -S.Vanzo Rough Draft

       Ever wondered what  urlLink Matt Groening  looks like?...   (Here's  urlLink another pic , and him as a  urlLink head in a jar  from some  Futurama  episode.)  His biography is also  urlLink quite interesting . Oh, and if you've never seen his "Life In Hell" comic strips,  urlLink here's one .

       After speech day, I went to the beach with my friends, which, as I was changing, decided to run away to make me run after them. I wanted to kill them when I got to them, but I needed to get my breath back, and when I did, the anger was gone. Oh well.  Oh, yeah, forgot to mention... in my way to where we were going -- some beach kinda far away -- we had to go through normal sand, then a bunch of rocks, then a nudist beach filled mostly with gay men. I wanted to see where I was going, but it was a little hard because to my sides there were old, fat and thin naked men, and old, fat, naked women; so I said to myself "just stare at the ground and keep walking..." Past the nudist beach was the beach we were going to.  I thought I didn't need suncream, and I take that back, since like six hours later, I was burnt like a fucking hot sausage on a barbecue, AND STILL AM. Unlike other times when I've only burnt my back and/or shoulders, this time it's the whole damn body, and thank god I wasn't wearing speedos or my legs would seriously hurt.  Having that said, damn you, Sun!

       A friend just showed me  urlLink Fiona Apple 's brand new single, titled " Extraordinary Machine ", of her future album which is hopefully going to be released sometime this year. Some people said the song wasn't that good, but I like it. Can't really judge a whole album on just one song, so I'll have to wait for the rest to come out. :/  For those that don't know, she currently has two  urlLink albums , " urlLink  Tidal  " (from 1996) and a Platinum winner (from 1999) titled " When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Fight and He'll Win the Whole Thing 'Fore He Enters the Ring There's No Body to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the Greatest of Heights and if You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where to Land and if You Fall It Won't Matter, 'Cuz You'll Know That You're Right ". (yeah, that's the actual title of the album, though Amazon felt like calling it " urlLink  When The Pawn...  " for short.)

       Well, I do have school again sometime in September, but that's a long way from now. (In one year I'll be able to say "YAY!! No more school!" and mean it literally, or so I hope.)  I gotta go to "speech day", which is tomorrow, and it's basically a 2-4 hour long excruciatingly boring speech. (I'm hoping I can manage to sneak my iPod and listen to something while they speak, or else I'll be most likely falling asleep of boredom, heh.)
