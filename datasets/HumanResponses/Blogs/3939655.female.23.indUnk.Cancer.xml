       Ever since I came back home after being in Austin for two years Ive never again been completely comfortable in my parents home.  See that, its not my home, its my parents home.  I guess the two years I was left to fend for myself has really changed me and has made me realize the importance of being completely independent from them. So after two years of being back at home, I am itching to leave. I know that it would be wiser for me to stay for a little while longer to make sure that I have the right finances to stand on my own, but I cant take it anymore. I must be independent again. Though my parents are wonderful parents, there has been this tension between us. This of course is all due to the fact that I feel they have nothing more to teach me, and they feel that I still havent grown up. This tension can be no more apparent than between me and my mother,  my mother and I for you anal english majors.  She is disappointed in the fact that I am not as fanatical about house cleaning as her, and I am annoyed at the fact that she is a maniacal cleaning machine. Im not that bad really, but because she tries to constantly lecture me, I in return act as if I am the slobbiest person in the world. All this to defy her, &nbsp;yes a little childish, but this is my nature. Dont tell me what to do because I will do exactly the opposite.  So at this time  my mother and I  are on shaky ground. Im never quite sure when she will flip on and off, I am just trying to stay out of her way because frankly, Im tired of dealing, I WANT OUT.

       i feel pitied, accomodated. me and my soapbox, again.  what does it matter, she always has to talk . i dont just want to talk so that i can hear my own voice, i want to discuss. but no one seems to really want to discuss anything with me. they just think that theyre just there to listen and nod in agreement or lash out with completely opposite opinions just to shut me up. why cant i just discuss? seems like people cant seem to believe that i could possibly be capable of discussing things with others. sure i get worked up over a topic sometimes, but thats just me. i can work myself down. this doesnt seem to occur to them though. to them i dont discuss, i proclaim. im sick of this. and it hurts that people just want to shut me up and that the way to do this is to completely disprove everything i say. i dont care whether im right or wrong, i just want to know both sides. i dont know. guess this is me on my soapbox again, and therell be someone that will want to shut me up.

       Started reading " Reading Lolita in Tehran"  by Azar Nafisi. The book is a memoir of the authors experience as a teacher and a woman in Iran in the early 90's. It discusses the effects of censorship and the influence of Islam in the post-Revolutionary years in Tehran, Iran. The author writes about her struggles with the Islamic Republic's expectation of her as a woman and a teacher at a university, and her experience with seven of her female students as they meet secretly to discuss censored works of western literature and how these works affected and shaped the groups perception of self. The author quotes a lot of Nabokov's  Lolita  and uses this text to form an analogy between literature and reality. This is a very interesting book if you happen to be interested in learning about culture and islam and the female experience. I dont know if this would appeal to male readers being that its high in estrogen content, but hey more power to the male who can. Im engrossed in this book because I do love to learn about culture and other religious beliefs, and I find the stories of these women to be very uplifting and eye-opening. I think that this book really achieves in showing that women do have inner passions and dreams that are often fiercely guarded and hidden from the outside world. It shows that women can be both vulnerable and incredibly strong at the same time.

       Hired at Ben Taub Hospital's Level 2 Neo. FINALLY! I start orientation on Aug. 9. Hopefully my parents will be able to help me with the down payment&nbsp;for my car by then. GUess? YUP YUP! Its the bug! Speaking of bugs, I saw a spider in my backyard mercilessly trap a moth in its web and inject its venom into the moth's&nbsp;squirming,&nbsp;spastic body. It was interesting yet creepy at the same time. Like discovery channel up close and personal. EGH! Anyways, nothing interesting about today. HA! Besides getting your first job Darlene!  You dork. I am odd. I know.

       Took my Boxer Rocky to the Millie Bush dogpark on Westheimer Parkway today. Tons of big, small, loud, and crazy dogs there. Lots of fun for me and my dog. Saw other boxers of course, and they were sooo cute. There are two lakes that the dogs can swim in but my dog seems to be scared of bodies of water, though he very much enjoys baths. Maybe I can just toss him in next time and see how he does.. is that mean? hehe. &nbsp;

       So today I was really excited because one of my bids on ebay stayed in the affordable range of my wallet, that is until the very last minute. The bid went up and so I raised my offer, then it went up again, and so, again, I raised mine. Oh but alas! I was seconds behind the deadline. Shitty shit shit!! You may say, "oh it happens sometimes" but I slaved over this product. I loved it as if it were already mine. I had to have it. Instead I get left out in the cold staring in disbelief as ebay proclaimed me  THE LOSER!

       I love sushi.    &nbsp;   Yan Sushi  - (fast food) Westheimer near Montrose   This is probably the cheapest sushi you'll ever buy. Some of the rolls are 2 something dollars each. Ive often stopped by this little eatery to satisfy Japanese cravings. Although it may not be the best sushi you'll ever taste it is worth trying when you're broke and having cravings. I say stick to the rolls and dont venture out into the sushi. If you can get something cooked thats even better.

       I walked the streets of Montrose and Westheimer today. No, not walking as in hooker/prostitute style, you sick bastard, I mean I strolled and explored. As I was happily discovering new shops and hang outs I came up with a better idea to use this nonsensical blog of mine.&nbsp;Ive decided that I would feature different and new places that I discover in and around Houston. I thought, "hey maybe some bloke will find it useful."     &nbsp;    Basil -  (Coffeehouse) Dunlavy and Westheimer    This place offers some of the tastest, richest coffee around. The Mocha chill is especially delicioso. It has a very European feel a la Diedrichs style (another coffee house) but doesn't have the same young college crowd occupying its tables. Its a perfect place to study because it's quiet and secluded. It also serves a wide selection of food, though a bit pricy.     &nbsp;

       I'm not a blog virgin, this is not the first and probably won't be the last. It is however, a start of&nbsp;a new chapter in my at-the-moment mediocre existence. Why mediocre? Well, I haven't exactly achieved anything worth writing about in the history books have&nbsp;I? &nbsp;Haven't achieved anything worth bragging about. Hopefully this will change.     &nbsp;   This is a funny time in my life, the odd, uncomfortable, exhilirating transition from college student to income-producing "adult." Yes, I am almost a&nbsp;23 year old young adult. It is hard to admit that I'm 7 years shy of thirty. And of course it doesn't help that I have wonderful supporting friends who take a sick enjoyment on constantly reminding me of this inevitable fact. Thanks guys, up yours too.     &nbsp;   At this time I'm just trying to find employment. I am a nurse with a bachelor's degree. Its been two weeks since I started my job search and only came up with promises of phone calls and potential interviews. When a person becomes a human resource employee is there a chapter in the job handbook that discuss and teaches about courtesy? Courtesy to call back as soon as possible to relay both good news and bad news so that us potential employees don't need to pine and wait over the telephone for the next week and a half! Our time is precious too you bastards! And if we so happen to leave a message on your boring answering machine can you at least have the decency to respond the moment you receive it?! I could be doing other more enjoyable things with my time which you human-resource-person-you seem to feel no remorse of wasting. Can't you see that I am already looking pathetic begging for a job which you take pleasure in dangling in front of my face?!! I am a good worker damnit! I am an asset! Shut up and take notice!

       was in austin, tx this weekend for a double birthday bash. sixth street till the wee hours of the morning sitting on the sidewalk with my head between my knees trying desperately to expel tequilla out of my insides. completely and utterly unsuccessful..shitty. i guess its been a while since i rode the alcohol wave cause i got tipsy off 3 shots and a girly drink. the whole night i kept thinking "metabolize yourself!" geesh, talk about being a science geek. luckily i had good friends to rely on - thank you chris, elly, and darren. i owe you guys one night of sobriety.
