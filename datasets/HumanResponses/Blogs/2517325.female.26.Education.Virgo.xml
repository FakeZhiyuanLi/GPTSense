      The kids have definitely been nutty today.  If my Christmas tree makes it to Christmas, I'll be happy!  I tend to do some work and then take a bit of a break, do some more, take a bit of a break.....and wonder why I don't get much done!  hehe

      it's amazing how friends can make you feel better when you feel like crying or topping yourself off....k, i didn't feel like topping myself off today, but i felt like shit most of the day.    i just got off the phone with katie, and feel so much better.  it's just nice to hear a familiar voice, even if we're talking to our respective kids simultaneously, and then going: "were you talking to me?"  it just makes me feel like i'm not alone.  which i'm not anyway....who can be alone when they're well outnumbered by those under the age of a year?    i really am wondering about my roller-coaster mental existence.  i really would rather just be riding a bus on a country road, you know.  on to the questions of religion....i know, i know.  but i feel as though even that, which had up until the past years been such a mainstay in my world, has gone through an earthquake.  and now i don't really know what is real and what is just trash.  i've been around parents who lost children or who would never be right...i have friends who have cancer......it just doesn't make sense to me anymore.  if there is a god up there, how can he go around picking and choosing like that?  then again, i don't like the idea of there being no life after death.  a friend of mine seems to avidly think this the case.  this scares the absolute shit out of me.  but then my mind wanders to what if heaven were just a ploy, thought up by people long ago, to make people more comfortable about death?    i don't know.....i'm just really confused right now.  letting it out seems to be good therapy, too....  :)  on a much lighter note, i am happy to report two things of great interest and excitement to me.  one is that i am the mother of an orange belt now!  collin has really taken a keen interest to karate.  he went through the first two belts with me.  as life got busier, i decided to back out and let him go it alone.  he has now gone through two belts by himself!  i am very proud of him!  and, to my great happiness, i am proud to announce my retirement in the indianapolis german school.  i just received an email from my boss saying that the enrollment does not warrant having two teachers, and that i can sit out the rest of the year.  this is absolute music to my ears!!!!  :)  i feel as though perhaps now i will be able to concentrate more on my Leaving Prints business.  WOOHOO!!!  Katie!  i'm coming down to play soon!!  ;)

      inferno-child is back today, but being fairly good.  so is the three year-old.  quiet day today, since the two year-old went with his part-time dad.  the dad's not such a terrible guy...he just has no clue when it comes to being mentally supportive.    i'm kind of blase today.  i just found out that one of my choir buddies has cancer, and they're only expecting her to live eight to twelve months at best.  she was the first person to welcome me into the church choir.  the choir was also a pillar of support during our whrilwind of fun last year.  it pains me to see when they have their own trials.  i just hope that God has a miracle up his sleeve for her.    off to feed inferno-child his cereal.  this has truly been the best thing i ever could have done (giving him cereal/solid foods) twice a day.  he's such a happier baby.

      blah......Griffin is such a bad napper.....it really pisses me off sometimes.....  :(  oh well.....could be worse, i suppose.  at least he sleeps through the night.  today's been a slow day.  i had two kids out because of the snow and one kid was sick today, so i just had the two part-time girls.....made for a nice break, since they are both older (four and seven are ancient in the daycare world, you know!  LOL) and they love the babies to no end.  the twins have been loving the attention!!  why is it that kids will want something you don't have, and then decide they don't really want it after all when you go to hell for leather to get what they want?  for instance, i made spaghetti today....i realized that i didn't have any sauce, which wound up being ok because the girls didn't really want sauce to begin with.....they eat their spaghetti with butter and parmesan cheese, the seven year-old said.  groovy, i said...until i realized that i didn't have any parmesan!!  grrr....so, i call up the neighbor to get some, run my braless t-shirted self (i really can't be bothered with a jacket) over to her house (in the snow) risking life and limb to get the parmesan....only for the four year-old to say...'i don't think i want parmesan today....'.......gotta love it.....  grrrr...griffin is now so tired he can't see straight, but won't sleep......he's desperately trying to get me to pick him up, but i'm being a mean mommy and trying to ignore him.  for this alone, i will probably go to hell.....that's ok, tho....because griffin will be joining me due to the fact that he keeps nipping at me while nursing.....  kids are such terrorists.......cute terrorists, but nonetheless............

      ***i'm warning you ahead of time that this post is a novel in and of itself......just sparing you the cost of the keyboard should you fall asleep reading this and slobber on it....i've ruined keyboards with liquid before, and i'm thinking slobber can't be good for the keys....***  sometimes i can feel myself on the downward spiral of bad mental well-being.  this would be one of those times.  not that i don't have enough on my plate, i guess.  just a year ago, i was pregnant with twins and was doing fine.  next week will be one year that my life went to hell in a hand-basket.  i guess i shouldn't be so negative about my life, but i have had my share of stress in the past year.  i had babies at 26 weeks.  nothing can prepare a person for just how tiny a one-pound ten-ounce girl is, or a two-pound, two-ounce boy, for that matter.  you know the beanie-baby bears?  that was the size of my twins.  they were both on ventilators, and both very easily could be dead right now.  it amazes me to look at them now; they are so healthy and full of life.  but this alone would cause some people to teeter on the edge of sanity.  they were in the hospital for nearly three months.    ten days after the babies were born, i started having chest pains.  at first i thought it was just water on my lungs from having surgery.  i had a c-section with collin, and remembering having to blow on this stupid contraption to 'exercise' my lungs.  well, no one gave me such an animal this go-around, tho they did tell me to take deep breaths.  i had more on my mind than this at the time, so i forgot (for those of you who know me well, i'm the queen of forgetfulness).  so, i thought this was just my body paying me back for not paying attention to this.  i made an appointment with the doctor to be seen the next week, and decided to suffer it out.  i started taking pain meds again (which i had stopped taking because the pain from the surgery had become bearable) and slept with a heat-pad under my chest.  by the next day, however, the pain had become so unbearable that i could no longer stand it, so i made aaron take me to the doctor's office without an appointment.  i would never ever do something like that, so that tells you how much pain i was in.  the doctor didn't think it could be a blood clot in my lung, but she wanted to make sure, so she had me go to the hospital for some testing.  for one test, i had to lie flat on my back.  this was the most extreme pain i've ever felt in my entire life.  i didn't think i was going to be able to take the pain.  sure enough, the tests revealed some abnormalities, so i was scheduled for a pulmonary arteriogram (aaah, the fun terminology i've gained from this ordeal!!)......have any of you ever had that before?  well, let me tell you about it....it was a real treat!!  they snake a scope through an artery in your leg, THROUGH YOUR HEART (holy shit?!?) and into your lung.  i got good sleep the night before this, let me tell you!  so i had the test, and they indeed found two small blood clots.  i always seem to get these serious illnesses that i downplay because i want people to leave me alone.  this was one of them....i had no idea how serious a blood clot in the lung, formally called a pulmonary embolysm, PE for short, was.  did you know that the largest number of hospital deaths are from PE's?  so, i got five more days in the hospital for that one.    of course, those two alone are enough to test the strength and endurance of anyone, i don't need to mention that a high number of mothers of twins/multiples suffer from post partum depression, or that child-care workers suffer extremely high burn-out....  it amazes me to think back on the past year and to see where i've been.  i've truly lived a thousand lifetimes in one short year.  in times of crises, we often go into survival mode.  our brain tells us that we can accomplish all the things that are set before us, and tricks us into believing at the time that things aren't as bad as everyone makes them out to be.  it's nearly laughable to me now to think that i was actually thinking such things when i was going through it all.  i had such a blind hope about the twins, and such ignorant bliss about the PE.  these things helped me to survive it all, tho.    i really should be thankful for what i have.  why is this so hard sometimes?  i have three beautiful children that i get to see much more than some moms do.  if i were doing what i used to do for employment, i wouldn't be seeing any of them right now....i'd be sat at a desk begging people to turn in their lousy tax documents, getting home in enough time to hop into bed and wonder how i was going to make it through the next twelve hour day.    i still wonder how i'm going to get through the next twelve hour day, as i'm working harder than i ever did before.  but I'M the one who gets to be there to feed my children, I'M the one who can help collin with his spelling words.  I'm the one my children want when they are tired.  wearying and lonely as my life has become, it is very empowering to me that i actually get to be with my children.  perhaps they will become upstanding citizens of the USA!  ;)

      snow day today....it's been weird having aaron home.  with a snow day comes collin, and we finished the bionicle book that we started.  only 30 more mins to read for the school-wide goal of 100 mins/or pgs per week!  i'm hoping that we'll get it every week, but i guess i shouldn't worry so much about it always being me who does this stuff.    i get so jealous of aaron having the day off work....he wants to sleep in, and that just irritates me that he can.  so i had him help me a bit this morning with the kids.  i don't think it will kill him.  i shouldn't really be so irritated at him...he does more around the house than most men i know.    the babies are toddling about the house now, eating everything they can get a hold of.  this morning erin stole one of gage's poptarts....she screamed bloody murder when i took it away from her....  :(  *sigh* i have to go......wild beasts are acting up again.......

      nothing much new to report here.  the weekend was pretty humdrum, with nothing exciting.  i had german school (one down, ten to go!) on saturday morning.  it went pretty well.  the girl that i co-teach with is a crack-up, and we get along really well (wonder why).  the bad thing is that if we don't have enough enrollment, we won't get to teach together anymore....that makes me sad, tho i will gladly step back and let her do it.  her husband might be laid off from work soon, so this would give her some much-needed income if one of us has to step down.  it would give me some much-needed rest, too!!  i would love to have a day where all i have to do is take care of my own children all morning!!!  i didn't scrapbook much over the weekend.  11 page YTD, so that is pretty good for my goal of 200, which equates to about 17 a month....we'll see...i think i'll get some stuff done over the week, especially if we get hit with more snow and school is cancelled!!  off to tame the wild beasts....must appease them with gifts of food......

      aaaah, morning......wonders what folding loads upon loads of laundry (and putting away my own clothes from the last laundry.....whistling, eyes darting back and forth, searching for the guilty party) and getting some sleep will do for you.    now that more people are reading this thing (waves to snapper!), i guess i have to let you in on my little family, since i don't know how to figure out how to make my blog really neat and pretty (waves to katie! hehe).....i'm 26, married to aaron, who's 27.  we've three kids, collin, 7, whom we had in college.  we got married when he was eight months old.....we waited, and waited, and waited some more, before we thought we'd have another baby.  one more baby, then we were done.  two's a nice, round, even number, you know.  so, we decide to have another baby, and BAM.....twins!  which winds up being a good thing, we get a boy and a girl.  i find out at 17 weeks that there are two, only to turn around and have them at 26 weeks.  (for those of you who go by months, that is roughly 6 mos pregnant)  erin and griffin are nearly a year old now (their birthday is february 11).  while there are few residual effects from their prematurity, they have physical therapy at least once a month (we're seeing if it needs to be increased, as well as adding occupational therapy to the batch.....we'll see).   btw, snapper....these are the non-nappers of the group!  :(  so now i've given up a job i was contentedly discontent with to stay home and baby-sit.  so, i now watch a three year-old, elizabeth, who would talk a glass eye to sleep;  gage, who is two and is acting it (need i say more?  hehe);  dante, the inferno-child, is six months old (yes, sign me up for that vacation with the men in white coats);  luke, who is the pisser, is three and comes one day a week; caroline, 4, and katherine, 7, come one day one week, two days the next.  it's a full house, but managable so far.  it wears me out, because it's like working a tax busy season (my old job as a glorified secretary) all year long.  i work from 6:15-6:00, and i'm tired.  it's my own fault, really, but with a teacher for a husband, i didn't have many choices on jobs (unless greg needs a telecommutuing assistant).  i couldn't expose the twins to the germs outside my home and i don't know as many people so i could constrict my hours to something reasonable.  but we're plugging along ok, and i'll get by with a little help from my friends!  :)  (katie, mt. dew, gin, and scrapbooking!)

      bahama breeze was cancelled.... :(  aaron's sister had to back out of babysitting because one of her cheerleaders fell out of a mount and had to be taken to the hospital....and, Mr. Greg-with-no-money-because-he-has-a-jeep-wrangler-hiking-and-a-hockey-habit *cheeky grins* the bahama breeze was gift certificates, i didn't eat lunch yesterday, which would make up for eating mcdonalds' for lunch one day and wendy's for lunch today....*tongue sticking out at the boy who spent the week in florida while we froze our asses off*    so i'm a little sad.....and to top it off, inferno-child's dad decided (without asking, mind you) to take his car to be appraised and didn't show until almost 7.......  ALL THAT AND I STILL CAN'T GET MY BUTTMUNCHING BABIES TO TAKE A DECENT FUCKING NAP!!!!!!!!!!!!  can i cry now?  i mean...i didn't cry the last time i really wanted to, so you think it would be okay now?    ok, so maybe i don't need to cry now, but i really do need to go to sleep....inferno-child gets here at 6:30 a.m......

      k...headache is gone.  kids are fed and changed, friend is coming by with lunch for everyone soon...hurrah!  :)  chicken nuggets and fry-fries two days in a row can't be too bad, can it?  if anyone has any ideas on how to get kids to run off energy in a very small space (we're talking nearly microscopic, here!), please feel free to pass them along....i'm sure there's a way to email me!  LOL  (yes, katie?  you really need to help me get this thing off the ground!  LOL)  the kids survived their shots ok.  i really hate them, but it's way better than going to the ER every time we turn around.    the voices in my head are telling me to drink some mountain dew, so i'm off to appease them.  if i don't, they just might send the headache back.    again, if anyone has any ideas on how to get kids to run off energy, please feel free to let me know.

      scrapbooking won out over drinking last night......nine pages MTD (month-to-date)....eight more to go for the 17 page goal....plenty of time!  hehe  mcdonalds' breakfast to compensate for the big fight yesterday....we're going to be in the good again, i suppose.  i do worry that aaron will someday hit me instead of breaking down the house.....oh, well.  busy ol' day planned......as soon as i get up off my lazy ass (being lazy after spoon-feeding three babies, making three glasses of chocolate milk and changing four shitty diapers (griffin's hit his two-shit maximum already....) and closing four doors to barricade bathrooms...why must griffin go straight to the toilet for fun? ) we'll paint pictures.....got to bust out the black and white to make gray for the preschooler......sighs.....  Goals of the day:  to finish the baseball page that I started last night, push through all the laundry (I know, Greg, that's all I ever talk about....but it's the bane of my homebound existence), and keep everyone alive.....

      so....aaron comes home and hops into bed...feeling much the worse for wear....this i sympathize with.....BUT...when he's going to bed just so he can stay out late and play computer games with his friends?  somehow i cannot sympathize with this.....fight ensues.....i love my life sometimes....aaron owes me a remote control and some spackle.....i'm just sayin'.  i don't even want to scrapbook anymore....just drink and sleep.....the raw irony of that is that one of my lovely boob-addicts will wake up in the middle of the night, so drinking is out.....at least tomorrow everyone comes here at 7:30ish instead of 6:15-6:30.....aaaah the life

      *yawn* I'm really tired today.  It was a very busy weekend.....I was all geared up to scrapbook on Friday, but burnt my hand on the pizza roll pan, so that destroyed that dream.  I stayed up late to watch "the goodbye girl" remake on TNT.  jeff daniels did too much research into the original, but otherwise it was a good flick.  the rest of the weekend was pretty much spent taking care of the kids and scrapbooking a bit.  aaron makes fun of me for all the scrapbooking i've been doing.  he says that i'm a bit disturbed!  hehe  i suppose i am!  but, i'm getting closer to the 17 pages for the month, so i'm not complaining!!  :)

      K...back from the docs.  Never a dull moment in this house!  I'm doing well with my psycho meds....we'll see.  I also found out that I would have to have shots in my stomach during pregnancy, so as of today, this baby maker is officially closed.  It makes me feel a bit sad to think that.  Having twins and not being bound by daycare has made me think that I would like to have ONE baby, within the bounds of marriage, and to attempt to have it without complications.  It saddens me to think that I'll never have a "normal" pregnancy.  I know that I should be happy to just have the three very beautiful (I'M not an obsessed mom, am I?!) children that I have, especially given the fact that I know plenty of people who have 1) had miscarriages and 2) had problems with infertility.    It still saddens me a little.  OK, that gone, I'm still a loser who didn't get anything folded or finished today!  We aren't even having chicken helper.....Taco Bell to the rescue!  yum!    I guess there's still time to do the laundry................NAH!!!

      After going to bed before 7, I feel really "on it" today.  Last night, after managing to get one page finished (three YTD!),  I used up all my remaining energy to clean baby/kid dishes that don't do well in the machine (as one of my pet peeves is to have all the little cups that you get from restaurants turned over and filled with nasty-ass water in them when all the other dishes are clean....).  After that, it was all I could do to remain awake!!  So, I went to bed with all my clothes still on and I didn't even have to wonder how I managed to get there!  (oh, the boring domesticated life I lead!)  I woke up this morning to a clean kitchen and living room, all the work of my dear and devoted husband.  I am really surprised that he didn't nag me about going to bed so early. Nagging is one of his hobbies.    I'm feeling more and more like a normal person today...this minute...which is subject to change at any given second.  I really feel like I'm accomplishing things today.  All the kids are fed and over half of them are sleeping (my kids insist on keeping their own time....how lovely of them!).  I am working with Inferno-child's mom to get a good feeding schedule down for him in hopes to make him a happy boy...which seems to be working....this minute...subject to change any given second.  I've managed to unload the dishwasher.....all that, and the other kids haven't managed to kill one another!    Goals of the day:  to fold laundry that's piling up in my bedroom (right behind me, as the puter is in my bedroom), push the other laundry through, make dinner (no good homemade stuff tonight....we're talking Chicken helper, here), clean up pile of thrown grapes and mac-n-cheese in kitchen along with dishes from lunch, and finally, to finish the layout that needs journaling and title page (aiming to do this without buying anything new....even though I would prefer to for the sake of the page....)......  stay tuned....will she be the usual loser, or will her streak of  being 'on it' continue throughout the rest of the day?

      OK, I really am a loser.  The laundry was folded by my husband, and I spent yesterday wrestling with the baby of my daycare.  He spends the majority of his time screaming, so I'm constantly trying to find ways to pacify him without picking him up.  I move him nearly every twenty minutes.  argh!  The real goal today is to fold the laundry I've got going (still....who knew that the difference in laundry between a family of three and a family of five would be so significant?!?!) and to finish those two stupid scrapbook pages!!!  hehe  Dinner's already in the crock-pot (beef stew, Collin will be happy and well-fed before karate tonight), so that's out of the way.  I just need to clean up lunch/art mess and make sure all the kids are groovy for the next three hours or so.  The days go by so quickly.

      Still no laundry folded and scrapbook pages finished.  I've journaled on one, but the other still needs some things....we'll see what I can do with the two hours I have left.  I did get most of the kitchen cleaned, though, which is a good accomplishment.  I need to figure out what to do with dinner.  blah.  Need something stronger than diet Coke or Mountain Dew.  :(

      HA, I'm such a loser.  I didn't do anything on my list from yesterday!  ho hum!  hehe  What to accomplish today?  Let's see.....fold laundry, finish two unfinished scrapbook pages.....let me try that, and we'll see where we go from there.  I've been pondering when to wean the twins.  In many things I've read, it says that Americans on the whole wean their children much too quickly.  My thought was to wean them at their adjusted birthday (May 16ish), but don't know whether to wean them later than that......it's not like I want to really go anywhere by myself!  (Correction:  am able to go anywhere by myself!)  Off to tame the wild beasts!

      OK, it's difficult for me to believe that it's been nearly a month since I've blogged.  The holidays make the time get away from me!!    I have things I need to do, but am having a hard time making it away from the computer.  It's naptime, so I have the right to sit my ass here, but I feel like there is so much else I could be doing.  I guess I sit here in hopes that any of my friends who chat will be on to keep me company, but...alas, no one is on today.  I spent a good portion of my time looking for a quote suitable for the scrapbook page of my friend and me making dresses and hanging out with our kids.  You would think htere would be some suitable quotes out there, but I might have to wind up making up my own....we'll see....so much easier to use someone else's words!    Things I want to accomplish today: kitchen cleaned two unfisnished scrapbook pages done fold laundry get reprints of family/kids pics made  We'll see.....baby-steps, baby-steps!  :)

      not too shabby of a saturday so far.  i got up and fed the babies, got ready to go, and went downtown to go out for lunch with my old work crowd.  it was fun to see everyone again, as i hadn't seen most of them since i quit in august.  while i don't miss the work i was doing, i do miss the commradery of going to work everyday to talk and laugh with these people.  our work relationships were not something you just find every day, and i can honestly say they are friends.  we picked up pretty much where i left off, and they had lunch just as if i wasn't really staying at home.  was nice.  i'm hoping to end off the day with a date with aaron.  it will be really nice to get out with just him to talk and be a couple.  we haven't been out on a date since the summer, so i'm really looking forward to it.  i hope that we go somewhere fun, but quiet so we can actually just enjoy eachother.  he's been really down in the dumps lately, and i wish that there were more i could do to make his life a bit better.  it kills me to see him so unhappy with life.

      i don't remember when i've been so happy that a friday was here!  yesterday was absolute 'shite', as the brits would say.  life is becoming way too dramatic for my taste.    case in point: the two year-old decided to find a steak knive that was on the kitchen counter (far enough back, i had thought)  yesterday.  he then proceded to stab my neighbor's boy with it, knicking his cheek.    thank god (provided he's there) it's friday.  nuf sed

      i can't believe that it's already thursday.  not that this week hasn't been a toughie, but it has gone by quickly.  the two year-old is driving me crazy.  he's totally two, and i've couched him for hitting, throwing and everything else in the past few days.  i packed up all the trains and put them in the garage, too.  i just hope that i can keep my sanity until this goes away.    the three year old turned four yesterday.  part of the insanity of the week was surrounding this, too.  i try to do special things for their birthdays.  we make cupcakes (i made good icing this time!!) and do a special craft.  yesterday, we made hawaiian type necklaces with foam flowers.    i don't know if this has anything to do with my hormones, but i'm feeling down again.  i feel alone and unable to cope with all that's going on.  today's much better than yesterday, but i still feel down, nonetheless.  i keep telling myself that this will soon all pass, but sometimes it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  aaron knows how i feel, at least, which makes it easier to deal with, somehow.  he does try to make things as easy as possible for me.  i just wish i were as good at doing that for him, as i know that he doesn't feel right, either.    i finally broke down and told him my doubts on religion yesterday, too.  getting this off my chest was a big relief, tho i know he seemed somewhat disappointed by it.  he understands, tho, and sometimes feels the same way himself.  who knows what i'll wind up actually believing.  right now it's hard to believe anything.  i don't know whether i believe, but it's a scary thought that life just ends at death.  you work hard to be a good person, and then you die and that's it?  that's no more appealing a thought.  sometimes i think i just wish that life would make more sense than it does.  that's all.

      and the bitch in me comes out big style......  it bothers me to no end when people start playing the 'who had the worst situation game'.  why must people always think they've had it the absolute worst and then try to give other people (that perhaps had it just as rough as them but in different ways), advice on their feelings?  please, help me put into perspective how someone who had babies at 35 weeks, who were in the NICU for 3 weeks, whose mother had toxemia and HELP syndrome, could feel like their situation was any worse than mine?  i do not go around toting the fact that the twins were preemies like a war symbol.  if people ask how old they are, i tell them their chronological age.  if they persist on why they look small, i tell them that they were three months early. most people do not know the severity of that, so they just drop it and move on.   we all go through shitty stuff.  it's a fact of life.  we all carry approximately the same load on our backs.  it just takes a different shape.  i just wish i could wear a sign on my back that says "please make no comment or give any advice about the load on my back".

      urgh....a weekend shot to hell by sickness....and this time it was ME.  blah.  i was so happy to be able to stamp/scrapbook, too!  pout, stamp feet....  at least inferno-child will be home tomorrow.  the poor little man has an ear infection, so when i called to say that i wasn't feeling especially well, they said that they'd just keep him home.  i think i'll manage tomorrow, then.    times like these get me to thinking how fortunate i truly am.  i had a friend in college who was a single mom with boy/girl twins.  i can't even begin to imagine how tough life was for her.  we hung out a bit, and lost track of eachother when i graduated.  but i can't help but think of how hard it would be to be going it alone.  thank goodness her parents let her live with them!  another friend of mine has many children and a husband who doesn't share the domestic load as much as mine.  i can't begin to imagine what sick days are like for her.  does her husband let her sleep in when she feels bad, or does she just muddle through, filling sippy cups in between those wonderful bouts of dizzying nausea?    don't get me wrong....my husband is a perfectionist, who is sometimes very hard on me.  everyone has downfalls, and i definitely fit into the category of everyone!  but i really have a good husband who does his best to make my life a little more pleasant for me.  he goes the extra mile to do nice things to make things easier for me.  like bringing the babies into bed in the middle of the night for me to nurse, or letting me sleep in as much as humanly possible when i'm sick.    i will definitely need to remind myself of this the next time he pisses me off!  :)

      ok....while i am not exactly a lazy ass, i feel it.  i never get anything done!  LOL  i went on a late-night run to michael's and target with my friend jan yesterday.  and of course, spent way more than i had anticipated.  and, while i didn't get the flyer made for the upcoming crop, i DID get some paper takers (target is clearancing out a lot!!  :(  ) to organize the paper line for crops.  this makes me happyj!  i do need to scrapbook more.  i'm kind of at a lull right now.  it's more that i'm so tired that it's hard to find the motivation to scrapbook.  oh, well.  i figure that in no time the babies won't require me to be there to bolt out to scrapbook or to lock myself in my space.  so, i'm enjoying this aspect of their lives while i can.  no problems there!    the weekend is nearly here!  hurrah!  i'm hoping to get some crafting in.  i would like to get some pages done (15 more for the month!  i think i can, i think i can!) and some cards made with my new stamps (do i really NEED another obsession??).

      it was a pretty good weekend.  the babies' birthday party was saturday, and they had a blast.  it's funny how something like that destroys their schedule.  at least today's another day, and they're back on track.    the babies each had their own cake, which was identical to the others except the colors and the names.  pink and blue, of course.  each had a teddy bear on top that was an actual cake that the kids could have for themselves.  and we still have a bunch of cake leftover, as usual.  it's ok, tho, because joan's cakes are the best!    i went with jan to wal-mart for a late-night, get everything we need before morning trip, and was looking at the clothes after getting diapers.  i look at the preemie stuff and it's finally looking small to me.  wal-mart has a nice selection of preemie clothes that don't cost a lot.  i picked up the outfits and marvelled at how small they were and how they were too big for the kids when we were first looking into buying them.  i used to laugh at a friend of mine who had a preemie baby and how she would comment on huge everything was that people were buying for her daughter, a miracle baby in her own right.  then it was my turn.  i seriously wondered how erin especially would ever grow big enough to fit into size 6/9 mos.  and now, here we are, almost growing into the 12 mos clothes.    off to put a diaper back on griffin, who has figured out how to take it off.  he's feeling like a king.  he perks up the minute he's fully naked, the crazy boy.

      in honor of the day, i have to take a minute and say how wonderful my husband is.  today, he let me sleep in.  today, he didn't fuss at me while i talked to an acquaintance in the middle of meijer while we were running late.  today, he gave me a valentine that he wrote from his heart, not some valentine that was bought from a store.  he's a wonderful man that i've been with for nine years now.

      friday is finally here.  finally a weekend to recover from the sixty-plus-hour workweek.  i do this year-round now, where it only used to be eight to ten weeks during tax time.  amazing how you would think being at home would make it ok, but it's very confining sometimes.  the good part about working sixty hours in your house is getting to see your kids.  i can't even begin to imagine what life would be like right now if i were still working at the accounting firm.  not to mention the fact that life there isn't as fun as it used to be.  amazing the changes that life brings your way.    amazing more so is the fact that you feel in your element at a new job after only being there a few short months.  i've only been at home for six months now, but i feel as though i've been doing this for ages.  just like i felt like i was at the accounting firm forever, and was only there three years.    next week will begin the weekly PT with the kids.  they will also have their first OT session.  i am excited for this to start and for it to be regular.  not only will it be another adult to talk to every week, it will be really good for the twins.  i'm so busy with everything with the daycare that i often don't get to play with them or work with them as i feel i sometimes should.  i don't feel too badly about it, tho, because they are doing things that my other friends who have babies around the same age/prematurity severity haven't even begun to do.  most of them are stuck at rolling over.  i feel bad about that, tho, and wish that their babies would do more to get caught up.  it's kind of like when we were all pumping milk and i would get eight ounces from each breast and they would get hardly any at all.  you don't even want to talk to them about it because you don't want to appear to be bragging.    i had my first LP party last night.  i'm really excited about starting this.  i've pretty much introduced all my family and friends to scrapbooking, so it's exciting to try to make a bit of a living off it.  the stuff we sell is great, too, so it makes it fun for me.  we'll see how it goes.  i don't know that i'm much of a good business person, but i'll find out, right?!

      i know that i've said before that i'm not a confrontational person.  my husband would laugh at me for saying this, because i'm always confrontational with him!  but i suppose i am a confrontational person.  i'm just not good at being confrontational.  i'm very passive agressive, and let things get to me too much before i explode.  i ruin friendships this way, i know.  some of the people i miss, and some of the people i don't.  but you know what?  i'm almost always glad that i've finally spoken my mind about things.  i know i'm not perfect.  most of the time i think of myself as the opposite.  but when i think back on these relationships, i know that i've done wrong and handled certain things  badly, but i do know that it's not all been me in the wrong.  i should have just said something sooner before i handled it badly.

      the twins had a very nice birthday yesterday, despite being sick.  aaron's parents came over and we had pizza, cake and ice cream.  they brought presents for the kids, and it's funny the difference between the babies already.  griffin was tired (he's not doing as well as erin at this point), so he wasn't really into any of the celebration, poor little fella.  erin, however, was having the time of her life, as if she knew it was her day.  she has the funniest smile!  it's really wide-mouthed and gaping.  too funny.   watching a one year-old eat cake for the first time has to be one of the funniest things to watch.  i would have to venture to say that most one year-olds do not have the luxury of getting cake and ice cream before their birthday.  perhaps this is just in my rose-colored world!  anyway, i digress.  watching two babies eat cake and ice cream for the first time was a real treat.  again, erin was in her element.  sitting on my lap, she toppled over the cupcake, getting icing everywhere.  then she dug into the chocolate (of course!) cake, loving every minute of it.  griffin was very interested in the cupcake, but was too tired to really get into it like he usually does about food!  i gave them each a few spoonsful of ice cream, which was even funnier to watch than the ice cream.  they both screwed up their faces at the coldness of it, but kept reaching for the spoon.    all this continues to amaze me.  last year at this time, we weren't positive that everything was going to be ok.  i would sit at their isolettes and wonder why all this was happening to me and my little babies, each barely bigger than a beanie-baby, fighting for their lives.  how blessed i truly am to have them!  they are little fighters, strong-willed and healthy.

      Happy First Birthday to the Twins!  :)  It's amazing that the time's gone by so fast.  I set my alarm to get up by 6 o'clock to go out to the grocery to get cake mix for cupcakes for the daycare (a tradition i want to start for the kids when they have birthdays), but someone (probably a rogue kiddo!) turned down the volume on my alarm clock and i never heard it go off.  so, cupcakes will have to wait for tomorrow.  oh, well.....  the girlfriend whose daughter i watch (the one who brings me payments of the mint chocolate milkshakes, as i refuse to take much money from her for like two or three hours of letting her kid entertain the rest of the kids...hehe) got the twins birthday hats.  one says 'birthday princess', and is light pink with feathery-type stuff on it.  too cute, and i can't wait to get pics of that!  the other isn't quite as cute, but is still a lot of fun (i mean, how can you top the birthday princess??).  it is something like a top hat with pom-poms around the base (instead of a brim).  it has 'birthday boy' on it, with some resin sports balls around the top.  very cute.    my mother-in-law has a tradition of telling the kids their birthday story.  every year she tells them about giving birth to them.  it's really funny.  i can't remember specifics of aaron's birth, but i do remember the fourteen hour labor she had with him!  how can one forget details like that?!  hehe  i say this, because i think of telling the twins their birth story.  what a story!    in this time of year, i suppose i will always have a measure of reflection of life's blessings.  granted, the cookie crumbles, and the crumbs have a tendency to make a big mess, but sometimes you have to think of it as "hell, it's still a cookie.....pass the milk!!"  yes, you get the times where the cookie is so crumbled, you don't think you'll be able to eat it.  but then, after you've finished scraping up the crumbles and eating them (of course!), you pick yourself up, head to the store, and buy all the shit that it takes to make a fresh batch.  and you know what.....they taste even better than the first one.    this is kind of like how my life is going right now.  i'm blessed with what i have, and know this, even if i don't always express it.  it's so much easier to express the negative in life, isn't it?  i should make it a goal to let the positive expressions of what i think about my life overshadow the negative.

      ho-hum....another humdrum day in my house.  it's not too bad, really, just is what it is.  have you guys ever hear the song "the ballad of lucy jordan" by dr. hook?  one of my uk friends told me about it....i think it's really going to be me.(well....if the theory that she really does commit suicide in the end rings true, then i can skip that part!!)  and while i should be content with this (i have three beautiful kids, a pretty good husband, a roof over my head, etc), i feel that there is a life out there that i'm totally missing out on.  it's an odd feeling of bitterness and shame.  not that these feelings are dominant in my life, but i do get the odd wave of 'is this really what my life will be like for me forever?'

      aaron's back from the doc's with the kids.  they have a viral infection....wayhay....aaron got the antibiotic, too, just in case.  the kids' ears looked red, but not pussy (is that really the same word?! LOL) according to the doc, so i think we're going to wait off on giving the amoxicilin before absolutely necessary.  i'm not a fan of just using antibiotics a lot.  when needed, dole them out, by all means, but if there is question, it's best to wait until necessary.    some might say we take the kids to the doc's too much, but griffin has asthmatic tendencies, so when they get colds, we almost always take them in, just to be sure.    i swear, i've never been to the doc's myself so much since these kids have been born.  i grew up in a 'suffer long enough and it will go away' philosophy.  aaron's family goes in whenever they sniffle, so i feel like i fall somewhere in between....until the babies are taken into consideration, that is.  i got sick more when they were in the hospital than i remember being sick in the five years prior to that.  it was hard, because when i was sick, i wasn't allowed to go into the NICU to see them.  i lost a good 15 days or so with them that way.    the natives are getting restless.  yes, folks, it's that time again....CEREAL TIME!!!  i must now adopt the blog mantra "breathe in, breathe out".  i'm not sure how much more of the sickness i can take.  thank god i don't have any more children of my own to deal with when they're sick.  three's enough, man.

      an exciting weekend to say the very least......at least the decorators finally left the building and i got laid!  LMFAO    i really must have really pissed someone off in my former life.  there are not many other things that would make you want to pull your fingernails out one by one......this would be sick twins.  in my little family, i am the one who takes care of the sick kids.  many a night have i laid on the couch with collin, listening for that distinct sound that only signifies the need for the puke bucket.  many hours of sleep lost in the persuit of not having to clean up yet another mixture of half-digested hotdogs, french fries and red kool-aid.  of course, aaron usually does the job of cleaning the puke.  i just get the kid for the rest of the sleepless night!     there have also been the few sleepless nights in the emergency room, where i took the kid by myself (or, in one case, with a friend who took pity on me), leaving the sleeping husband at home, swearing that i've over-reacted and that all i was accomplishing was to get us a hefty hospital bill.  once, the docs said they would have admitted the child, and once, the docs actually did admit the child.  *sticking tongue out at aaron*  so, the weekend was full of the pitiful cries of the babies, following after me like lost sheep.  looking at me with those woe-begotten eyes, that say 'c'mon mom, pick me up!!'    i'm getting to be quite the bulb syringe queen, too.  aaron looks at me in awe as i work the magic of getting all the gook out of their litle noses while simultaneously holding them down.    at any rate, i'm getting behind with my scrapbooking goal!!  you know....the IMPORTANT things!!  LOL  i'm hoping to get a few pages done while aaron takes the twins to the doctor to get a fix for their penicillin deficiency.  (i'm secretly hoping that this is just a passing virus, though.  i'm really not a fan of the antibiotics)  OK, off to spoon-feed three and hopefully help two giggling girls make snow globes!  :)

      today's been just like many other days.  nothing exciting happening.  and nothing much exciting will probably happen today (here's hoping, i guess!  there could always be some sort of catastrophe!)  recent events of note are that the kids' therapies have increased.  they will now do physical therapy once a week and will now have occupational therapy once a month.  while in fact they might not need it, the therapists and i have agreed that it could only help to get too much therapy.  they do things with the kids that i hadn't even thought of.  i didn't think that they were necessarily ready for the push-toys, but there she was yesterday, getting the kids to stroll around the living room, pushing along a shopping cart of sorts!  i can't tell you how happy this makes me.  she also put the kids' shoes on and got griffin to stand alone for 15 seconds.  watch out world, they might just be walking soon!    i can tell you that when i went to the developmental ped's office, i wasn't exactly thrilled that they had recommended the increased therapies.  it felt like just another failure to add to the mix.  the pregnancy failed and now i failed them with the developmental stuff, too, but i have since gotten over that.  hey, it's someone to play with the babies and push them a bit more than i had thought to, so how can that be bad?  they are still doing remarkably well considering they were half-baked in the first place!  if they were nine months old as they should be, we wouldn't be thinking that they should cruise the furniture already!  so i have now come to terms with it, and now see it as a good thing that is being given to my babes.

      why do boys love gross things?  griffin's awe-inspiring item right now is the toilet.....when he learned to crawl, the first thing he did was crawl to the bathroom.  at first it was just to flop his feet on the floor to hear the slapping sound.  now it's to go right to the toilet and find whatever he can to put right into his mouth.  (remind me again why i kiss that mouth?!)  yesterday was the best, though....he is pulling up on everything nowadays, and figured out that the toilet had water in it.  he loves the bathtub, so i'm sure he probably just assumed that it was a smaller bathtub, but he starts splashing around, playing in it!  (sigh)    boys will be boys, i suppose!

      on the whole, i feel as though i am a non-confrontational person.  but i tend to take what everyone says to me to heart....which is not good when you don't feel as though you can put up a good rebuttal.  people have opinions, and i can say that i am one of them.  i mostly try to keep them to myself, even though i do find myself giving out my unsolicited opinion sometimes.  but i feel as though people often dole out their opinions to me when they have no idea what i've been through.  take parenting, for instance.  how many of you out there have had babies born at 26 weeks?  i didn't think so.  how many of you had to wait for a month and a half before you could hold your daughter, and even then, it was a baby who was three pounds and on a machine that helped to keep her alive?  i didn't think so.  how many of you had to watch as nurses drew blood for the not the first time that day?  or stuffed a feeding tube down your kids' nose, giving milk to them that you had to pump eight times a day because they were to small to nurse?  or watched your child turn blue right before your eyes for not the first time?  i didn't think so.  so, how many of you now have the guts to tell me that i shouldn't keep treating my children differently than you because they were so small at birth?  there really is no comparison.  while i do not keep my children in a complete bubble, i do need to treat them differently, so please don't tell me that i shouldn't.

      another tuesday....it seems as though the days go by so quickly.  pretty soon it will be the weekend again.  at the very least i have nowhere to be on saturday!  :)  i did quite a lot yesterday.....mostly menial stuff around the house.  what else is there to do?  i pushed through much of the laundry and unloaded the dishwasher, in addition to feeding kids and putting out the occaisional fire.  hehe  last night i did two scrapbook pages and worked at finishing another two.  all within two hours.  not too shabby.  i really seem to get into the zone early in the month and then peter out towards the end.  i've got to stay with it for the entire month.  i really want to get a bit more caught up.  we'll see!  :)  todays goals:  scrapbook collin's first school-friend birthday party;  keep all kids alive;  push the rest of the laundry through; keep kitchen relatively clean (not necessarily in that order, of course!)  my friend is bringing me a chocolate-mint milkshake for payment for watching her girlie.  that is always something to look forward to!  also, the sis-in-law has a snow-day, so we'll be dining on totino's pizza and mountain dew for lunch.....aaahhh, the gourmet life!  ;)

      had a good weekend.  saturday i got to sleep in until 11:30!  it's been ages since i've been able to sleep in like that.  i usually have to get up to feed the babies, and then wind up staying up, so this was a good treat.  i had stayed up until 2:30, so it was much needed rest!  :)  we went to aaron's parents' yesterday to watch part of the super bowl.  aaron has been wanting to make jumbalya for his family for a long time, so he made a huge pot of it for everyone.  he wound up burning the bottom of the pan, so it tasted a little smoky, but it was good.    erin was up half the night...i'm not sure what her little deal is.  she's got something wrong with her if she's up crying like that.....i think that she's either teething or has another ear infection.  i know we're bound for tubes with those guys. it could be worse, i suppose, especially with them.    natives are getting restless....it's my cue to get up and moving!

      things are going ok today.  nothing much new to report....i'm down a babysitting kid, which makes it only five in my house today.  not too shabby.  it would otherwise be seven!  YIKES!!    my latest crusade (here comes the shameless request) is the March of Dimes Walk America.  why?  because they have funded the research behind many of the treatments for premature babies.  who knew that i would feel so strongly for the charity organization that kept me busy for hours on end with my grandma, reading every book i could?  i remember my brother and i getting medals for reading so many books!  i even won an owl because of it!  LOL  the things that come running back.    ANYWAY, i digress.....premature babies....when i was younger, it was simply for birth defects, as many of the children that survive prematurity now, wouldn't have back then....WHY?  because of the research and development that was funded by March of Dimes monies.  SOOOOOO, here goes......SPONSOR ME!!!  here is the link to which you can go and you, too, can make a pledge and save babies like erin and griffin.   urlLink www.walkamerica.org/sabyers .    so....there you have it, ladies and gents....my latest crusade that doesn't include paper and glue.....tho that crusade is continuously rearing its beautiful ugly head....*yawn* i was up until past midnight last night scrappin' the night away!

      i really do feel like a new woman right now......i got out of the house today, DURING WORK, and went to both Hobby Lobby and the P.O.  i also went thru the drive-thru to get a supersize diet coke for myself......i would LOVE life if i could do that, even once a week!  it was  fun to be able to concentrate on only my babies (well....and gage, too, but he's almost like mine...lol).  i do know why people with three small children don't get out much, tho!  ;)  so i'm feeling a lot better than last week at this time.  i'm just hoping that things keep going as well!  :)

      today's a down day.  i'm fairly tired of life.  i'm tired, i'm lonely, and i'm feeling sad.  i don't have the energy to enjoy my life at all.  i work sixty hours a week, taking care of kids who beat up on my kids, and i want a break.  i want people to talk to.  i want to be able to shower every day.  i want to be able to go out and get a mountain dew at nine o'clock in the morning.  i want to fit into size six jeans again.  i want to have the energy to scrapbook.  i don't want to have to worry about money.  i want my kids to be healthy.  i want to not have to worry about rsv, weight gain, and physical development.  i want my friends to be happy.  i want my friends to have jobs.  i want to go away from my house.  i want to be able to have as many babies as i want.  i want to be able to sleep past six o'clock in the morning.  i don't want to have to worry about two year-olds biting, kicking, and whining.  i don't want to have to listen to babies who aren't mine cry all the time.  i don't want to have to always clean up toys in my living room.    i don't want much out of life......i just want someone to stop this thrill-ride, because i don't want to ride it anymore.

      the crop went well.....for me being as unorganized as the day is long!  about five girls showed up, and i sold about thirty dollars worth of product!  not too shabby!  i'm tired of being sick, tho...i went for a walk on saturday morning and my sinuses really went whacko afterward!  i took a nap, and felt better when i woke up, but i'm really tired of the congestion and pressure.  am making plans now to go to the docs on wed.  not really wanting to, as don't want to use antibiotics, but am thinking my body wants them...hehe  cleaning is something that can be addictive.....which is probably why i don't like to do it, seeing as i have an addictive personality and am an all-or-nothing kind of girl.  case in point....i get the wild hair up my butt to clean the living room, voiding the entertainment shelf of all the videos that the babies like to toss on the floor every day, replacing the videos with some toys that are bigger and more easily picked up.... this turned into organizing the videos into daycare/collin/adult stashes, which turned into putting together toys that needed to be put together since february, which turned into dusting, which turned into spot-shotting the carpet, which turned into me wanting to clean the kitchen cupboards, but stopping myself before it got later than 1 am!   why do things like that happen?  now i know how my mother-in-law keeps a spotless house...it becomes an obsession!!  sunday was spent lounging on my mother-in-laws couch, with the same sinus issues, gorging myself on hashbrown casserole, and picking up tons of veggies off the floor, thrown down by my mother-in-law-encouraged twins.....   today's not been a bad day so far...i'm running a bit of a tighter ship these days and encourage the kiddos to help me clean the toys up....we'll see how long we can do it.....

      today is the day of my first crop!  crossing fingers that i can get through this 'first' just as well as the party!  :)  i didn't send out too many invitations, but hopefully this will help boost my confidence to start getting the word out.  i'm really self-conscious, and don't want to appear pushy or weird!  LOL  i'm finally starting to feel a bit better.  kudos to aaron for finding some good cough syrup.  he had help at the pharmacy.  they know our family by our first names, and are always willing to help us get whatever we need.  it's neat to have that kind of situation...makes me feel like westfield is starting to become our home.  anyway, hopefully the rest of the house will recover from the cough and we can move on from it!    i need to figure out how to feel closer to collin right now.  he's going through the typical seven-year old stuff, and i'm afraid i'm not very patient with him these days....i like to read books to him at night, but sometimes that doesn't become a huge priority.  so, that's my biggest goal for the moment.

      not a bad day so far....got lots of sleep, so that makes up for a lot!  :)  these days, i'm feeling a little more comfortable in my own skin.  i do have days, however, where i'm really wanting to have some down time that doesn't have to start after 8 o'clock at night.  i think most people would agree with me that running from 6 am to 8:30 pm solid five if not more days a week is tiring and would get a person down.  in order to have fun, i have to stay up late, therefore sacrificing my health.....which i've done!  LOL  i know that part of this is my own fault....i've decided to let the twins self-wean, and am tossing up the idea of trying to nurse up until next year, too.....the whacked out reasoning behind such a decision??  i can't afford the RSV booster....i looked at the sheer amount of what it would cost us out of pocket.....$400 bucks a month AFTER insurance did it's thing!!!  oh...did i mention that this is PER CHILD??  it would be my hope that if i nursed them that they would be a little more resilient to respiratory infection.....they've had their bouts of problems this year, and both are on nebulizer treatments.  my thought is that perhaps i could nurse in lieu of the shots next year.  and, for those of you who question their susceptibility to RSV at this age, babies born at such an early gestation (like 26 weeks), are susceptible for far longer than their full-term peers.  hence, we might have to deal with the shots next year, if not for the simple fact that we've had so many issues this year.  urgh!!  when will it end?  i moaned "i can't wait to treat them like normal babies!!" to a fellow dad of a preemie last night...to which he replied "it's never going to happen!"  great!  LOL  oh, well....this too shall pass, and pretty soon we will be treating them as normally as a person can when they still see the 1 lb. 10 oz. girl or 2 lb. 2 oz. boy behind the big, chubby, playful kiddos.    and pretty soon, mommy will be able to go away for a day and not have to worry about coming home in the middle of the day to nurse them!  and the same mommy will be able to get out of the house before 8 pm to have some fun of her own.  i think that same mommy will be a lot more happy, too!  ;)

      i'm sick of being sick!!  *cough, cough*  ANYWAY,  we all always call erin our little princess.  i mean, who doesn't usually call their baby girl a princess?  yesterday, i came to the realization that the only kind of princess that my daughter could be likened to is a midieval one.  she was eating, with her clothes off (of course!!), all her food spread out on the table in front of her.  her little fat belly was covered in food, and she was lounging in her high chair, with one leg propped over the side.  she picked through her food by scraping it across the table, sifting through it to eat only the choicest pieces.  the other, less satisfying pieces, were pushed to the floor.    it was a humorous thought, anyway.  i just had thoughts of what a medieval king must look like.....she only needed a turkey drum!

      griffin has an ear infection and a sinus infection.  he slept all night without coughing or anything (thank you triaminic!).....which left me to worry irrationally this morning!    got my load of stamps!  i'm pretty stoked at my stash.  i got a crumb-ton for just over 100 bucks, so i'm pretty happy.    was up to midnight lastnight arranging my stamps (they come unmounted, so you have to put the bloody things together....) and cleaning my hellish kitchen.    i've decided that giving a complete blow job isn't going to be a successful mission for me.  i think i've an aversion to the texture......LOL  sorry, aaron!  :)

      as i start to feel better, griffin takes a turn for the worse and winds up with 101 fever and is going to the doc this afternoon.....eventually everyone in this family will feel better!  *blah* we go back to our old doc now that our insurance changed...again.  we like him much better than the other bunch o'quacks we were seeing, so we're kind of glad for the change.    nothing else much of anything to report.  same old same old goings-on.

      feeling better today....i figured out that as long as i keep pushing sudafed that i feel better!  imagine that!  LOL  got a bit of scrapping done last night!  wayhay!  finished up some pages that had missing journaling.  pondered over those that i'd not started.  finished the make-n-take swap for LP.  i'm feeling in the groove....must stay there if i'm ever to get anything done.    tho i realized that if i do 200 pages this year, i might be caught completely up!  LOL....if i get 25 done this month, i just might be through 2001.  we'll see.  it would be wonderful to be that far caught up!  i have a house album and a vacation album to do, but i think that i'll be able to get those in under the 200 page mark, too....we'll see.    i might never get caught up if i scrap too many of the digipix i've been taking.  i can only imagine what it would be like if i had an unending batt supply and memory card!  jeez!  must go give my sacrifices of food to the natives, lest they get restless.....they could form a coup or something, and then where would i be?

      feeling a bit foggy today.  my nose is ever stuffed up and my voice is gone.  oh, well....there isn't anyone to talk to and anywhere to be anyway, so what does it matter?  LOL  i'm currently working on some things for my LP swap....a long time ago i swore off scrapbooking swaps, but this is different.  it's a make-n-take swap that's aim is to use LP product efficiently.  so i'm making these really cute tags....we'll see.    i also need to get stuff ready for my first show.  who knows if anyone will be there, but we'll see!  :)  i'm nervous beyond all belief, but think things will be fine.  i also need to get a flyer together for my first crop.  i've also ordered some extra things (shhh...don't tell aaron!!) in the hopes that people might want to buy them as they work.....we'll see!  :)    {that's really a mantra of mine!!}  it is really my hope that i get this scrapbooking business off the ground.  i really think i could do well at it.  i just need to put more brainpower and time and effort into making it fly.  again....we'll see......  i need to set up some goals for it.....so....let's see:  bookings:  get three bookings for late March-early April.....to be done by March 15 Out of the Box:  sell one subscription.....to be done by the end of March recruits:  one recruit (?) .....to be done by the end of March demo album:  put together the tearing kit and put LP product pages in an album....to be done by Sunday at 2:00.... demo album:  get together a few pages of why LP?  why i scrapbook?  a little about me.  etc....to be done by March 13.  i'm tired with just writing those down!  LOL  but i feel as though i perhaps might do a little more work to attain them if i write them out.  again.....we'll see!  :)

      the weekend was decent.  saturday night, aaron and i went to a place called 'on the border', a mexican restaurant with good food and decent margaritas.  we were going to go to bahama breeze, but it would have been a 50-70 min wait, and i hadn't eaten anything since around noon and it was already 9!  geezy peats you would think less people would be out and about at 9!  (i know, i know....26 going on 86!)  it was a nice dinner, tho.  i started losing my voice, so it was hard to talk to aaron, but it was fun to be out with just him.    sunday was spent at the hospital with jan.  she sent her little boy over to my house (they'd tried calling, but my mother-in-law was jabbering to me) to tell me that she was throwing up and was really sick.  so, i followed him back to their house, where i found jan sitting on the steps, sobbing because she was in so much pain.  i went home to change, and then gathered up toys for her son, not knowing whether we'd be taking him with us to the hospital.  wound up that her husband came home from church, so we decided that i would take her in to the ER while he stayed with the kids.  we got there, and they couldn't give her anything for the pain and nausea until the doc saw her.  the nurse was really rude about it.  we sat there for what felt like forever, with her vomiting and clutching her side in pain.  i kept putting cool cloths on the back of her neck, feeling like the biggest dumbass because i didn't know what to do to help her.    she wound up having a kidney stone, which she passed after she got home.  she goes to the docs today, and hopefully they'll put her on some sort of regimen that will help her to pass any that are left.  she's been having trouble with this for a while, but no one  could tell her what was wrong, so who knows how many she's passed.  poor thing.  i slept for the better part of the rest of the day yesterday.  i'm still not feeling especially great now, but am muddling through.  at least i'm not doubled over in pains worse than childbirth!  thank goodness for small favors.

      ok...i fell completely off the flylady wagon yesterday....back on today...shoes are on, and i ate breakfast, etc.  i know what i'm having for dinner, because i made a menu!  LOL......roll wagon, roll!!!!!!!!  i'm feeling a bit tired these days....i can't seem to get to bed at a reasonable time, and it gets wearing!!  i feel better mentally, tho, so i'm going to shut up right now!  LOL  happy birthday to my sister-in-law and my brother!  really crazy to think that we're all getting older like this....the brother is 28 now and the sis-in-law is 23....i still feel like my brother and i should be digging crawfish out of the pool in the creek (yes, i really did this!! LOL) and i met alaina when she was just a freshman in high school, so i'm thinking she should still be a geeky teenager!  LOL  and now my brother is a father of two rambunctious boys and my sis-in-law is a first year law student!    speaking of getting older....the baby brother who shat upon me when i held him for the first time went to prom this past weekend....boy do i feel old....and he's....gasping whisper.....in LOVE!!  yikes!

      today's been an alright day so far....i was up far too late to be getting up at 6:00!!  so i'm a little tired today, but i've already cut coupons from the last few months.....i'm caught up with that, too!  LOL  i booked two Leaving Prints shows last night.....i'm really wanting to get myself in gear, so hopefully that will help.  i also am getting ready for this craft bazaar that i'm going to on saturday.  i'm really excited about it, but am really nervous....i'm going to do a door prize drawing, and hopefully get some people to commit to classes.....  aaron is very happy with this new leaf  i'm trying to turn over....i really hope that i can keep it up, because the house is a lot happier when it's clean and organized....go figure....it's only taken me 26 years to figure this out, but that's not too shabby because i didn't have the influence of my parents backing me up all this time.....sharon, mommy, my step-mom did the best she could considering she had three sons and a daughter, not to mention my father helping her to make the messes.  i'm so happy that aaron does so much helping around the house....granted, it's not up to my flylady-psycho standards, but at least he does it, which is a lot more than most women can say!  LOL  things to do today....(btw, i DID get around to folding the laundry and working on my scrapspace yesterday....the downside is that the laundry didn't all make it put away and the scraproom is very messy, so it's going to take today to work on it, too!  LOL)  1.  put coupons in organizer 2. figure out how to put babies' clothes away (this is not such an easy job, because they're either tearing it apart as i'm figuring out how to do it, or they're sleeping, and me working in there just seems to wake them up) 3.  finish cleaning scraproom 4.  call a few people regarding Leaving Prints 5.  turn in two shows for Leaving Prints 6.  figure out what to make for dinner now that we're not going out (WE'RE GOING TO LISTEN TO BEN FOLDS IN LAFAYETTE ON SATURDAY INSTEAD!!!!!)

      life can be really good when you give it some effort!  i can see the floor in my bedroom!!  i dont' have any dirt laundry in the hampers!  dh did the bathrooms yesterday (tho somehow managed to miss big globs of toothpaste and dirty spots in the toilet...hmmm...), dinner's in the crockpot (pork roast, but at least it's done!!), the kids are actually doing a craft today, and i have menus planned for the entire week.....  someone take my temperature, because i think i've fallen ill with something......  perhaps i will actually get to scrapbook sometime in the near future.....  things to do today: 1. fold laundry (only three loads, tho) 2. put laundry away 3. clean scrap area 4.  sort toys, clean them, put them in babies' room  that doesn't include fixing meals and cleaning the kitchen or feeding babies.....LOL  and....happy birthday to my mommy-sharon!!  :)

      god, i am so bored.  i'm really wishing i did something else.  a person needs more adult company than this.....surely there are laws about how long a person can go without hearing a real voice!!  after a while, the lonliness really starts to get me down.  most other things about my life are totally doable.....but that aspect is really starting to wear on me.  i really do love being with my children....being the first one to see griffin take a step....being there for him when he's sick and just wants his momma.....knowing all about erin's tickle spots and how to make her laugh.....those are things that really make it all worthwhile....loneliness, however, makes it hell sometimes.    guess i really should start talking to myself aloud....the voices inside my head just aren't doing it for me anymore!

      another not-so-bad day in the land of shitty diapers and splattered baby food.  the school boy is home (with dad, actually, but dad's been working on his grad work and has therefore been back at his classroom today) today, as the start of his spring break.  it's been odd to have him home.....case in point....he didn't get breakfast today simply because he didn't pipe up......am i a bad mommy or what?!  i did try to soothe over the wound with gifts of harry potter and the chamber of secrets read aloud, but i still feel two inches high.  oh, well.....did i mention that dad was home for breakfast?  while some of you may do everything around the house that pertains to children, the husband is usually good at doing his fair share.  oh, well.....chalk him up on the bad parent list, too.  got a little bit of a nap, tho, when harry wore me out.  so all is not lost!  ;)

BUT......i DID get out for a date, and my husband is working on the wooing....so far this week, i've been showered upon with gifts of jelly belly's...all my favs!...and a book....and he 'fessed up that he's got some hand lotion for me, too.  he's such a sweet and thoughtful guy.  please remind me of this the next time he really pisses me off!  ;)  i must really find a way of spoiling him back.....hmmm...... AND...the best part of the night is that we got to eat at bahama breeze!  woohoo!!  now...time to go take the sleeping babies out of their cribs and force the boob on them.....hopefully this is not a bad mommy, but they're very full and starting to hurt.....

      there is a mental disturbance that has hit the byers household since last weekend.  carpet envy.  yes, that's right, carpet envy.  it's when your neighbor shampoos her carpets so that they look brand new, and you go back home to your carpet that has more grime in it than a mud-wrestling pit!  not mentioning the fact that i usually have between five and eight kids running around the house at any given moment on the weekday.    so, to cure my newest mental illness, i borrow the mother-in-law's carpet shampooer and spend the better part of the day shampooing the great room and hallway.  unfortunately, that's all that i had time to do!  LOL  but...boy, do i feel all  urlLink fly  now that my carpets are clean!  :D  but...since i got the carpets cleaned, i need to fold the mound of laundry that built up as a result!  oh, well!  LOL  it's supposed to rain today, so that will give me plenty of time to do it.    other things on the agenda today are to spend my  urlLink michael's  coupon and buy a  urlLink sizzix !! i'm stoked.  what more could a scrapbooker want?  the downside to this?  i now have to let aaron go to michigan city next thursday and friday to hang out with the other second grade teachers.  (shhh...don't tell him, but i don't mind him going, really, even if he is going on a week-long vaca in july...i just didn't want him to be the only one to NOT go....AND i wanted a sizzix! LOL)  ok...off to clean the scrap-space (it's part of my closet...need to find the pic so that shez knows what i'm talking about!  hehehe) to make room for the sizzix!    i'm such a nerd.....i never thought i'd be this domestic!  LOL

      i met my first person through blog!  :)  how fun is this?  i discovered the profile link (why i didn't do any of this before was crazy on my part) and filled it in and made it public, not knowing that it would post it on my page!  LOL  i love being a techy stupid!  hehe  and the best part, which i mentioned a few days back, is that it links you up with other people who've said they like similar things.  if you go to your own profile and click on some of the things you like, it will show you bloggers who have put the same thing down....LOVE IT!  anyway, i met  urlLink Shez  , a UK'er and new blogger!  thanks for coming my way!  we have some things in common, best of which is scrapbooking!!    i'm really liking the blog.  at first i didn't put the time and effort into it, but now i really like it and keep wishing i'd had it a year ago....oh, well....as they (*they* being my stepmom...) "hindsight's 20/20".  ;)

      On Motherhood.........  i know it is our destiny to annoy our children....but i really hope that my children will see me for a good mommy.  i'm by no means perfect, but i really hope that i'm doing a good job.  i love my children with all my heart.  i really hope they want to be around me when they have kiddos of their own.

      ho-hum, another wednesday here and nearly half over!  LOL  we have been playing on our new swingset.  it really is going to be a life-saver this summer!! i'm so happy that aaron relented and let me get it....and also let me spend the extra bucks on the nicer playset and climbing wall.  the babies love it, and climb to the top and make their momma scramble up as fast as she can to prevent them falling off the platform on the other side!  :)  i love that they can do it, tho!  it probably doesn't hurt that i'm climbing up with them at break-neck speed, either!  a little exercise never hurt anyone!  LOL  i'm really going to take the LP plunge.....i am going to start having small classes out of my home.  june 10th?  eyelets!  ;)  we'll see.  it will be interesting to see if anyone comes to it.  crossing my fingers that i can make this thing work.....i just need to dig inside for that motivation and the balls to just do it!    griffin has been trying to sing his abc's.  it's very cute.  he really does love his music.  and the way he says buh-bye is the best!  speaking of which, he just said good-bye to joe on blue's clues.  it's too sweet!    i put erin's hair in a lone pigtail on the top of her head.  it's the funniest.  i'm rather liking this girlie-girl stuff.  i love buying her these fun dresses that she can crawl around in.  the cutest thing is to see her butt with little diaper-cover panties on it!  :D  i'm really hating this mommy thing!  LMAO

      the week got off to a pretty good start.....the day was pretty good yesterday.  one of the daycare kids was gone, so that always makes for a quiet day.  i stripped my bed of everything, including the dust ruffle and mattress pad and tossed everything except the comforter and shams in the wash.  my washing machine wondered what the hell happened to it...how do i figure?  well....it was found about six inches from where i left it, and i heard it complaining pretty loudly a few times!  LOL    i'm also rummaging through the babies' closet, clearing out things that need to be shoved up into the attic...."oh, aaron!!!"  ;)  i cleared out their dresser drawers of too-small clothing and washed up some hand-me-downs that griffin had received.    i also managed to put together a scrapbooking kit at jan's last night.  i really need to get my butt going with my scrapbooking business.  i think that i could really teach people if i just got going with it.....yes, i can say and spell P-R-O-C-R-A-S-T-I-N-A-T-I-O-N.  for some reason, i have trouble mustering enough self-confidence to get things going.  i think that this is one downfall of the company....there really isn't any guidance from the higher-ups on getting things rolling.  sure, i have an upline...in wisconsin.....and there are people who do chat room trainings, but it's not as good as having someone face-to-face...oh, well.  it'll happen....i just need to get to work building so they will come!  LMAO!    off to do elmo coloring pages and build lady bugs with circles....we're having strawberries for lunch today.....can anyone guess what today's theme is?  ;)

      this weekend was good.  got some rest in, which is always nice.    yesterday we went to visit the NICU where erin and griffin were for nearly three months.  it was fun to see the three people that were there that took care of the babies.  one of the nurses that took care of them was there and hadn't seen them since they left the hospital.  she took care of them when they were first born, but left them to take care of someone else's babies...a woman she had known since the woman was three!  so i didn't blame her.  but she always says how guilty she feels about it.  but she totally helped keep me together those first few weeks in the NICU.  she was so sweet and caring, and really loved my babies, which made me love her.    it's really an emotional subject for me.  the nurses and respiratory techs became my friends while they took care of my kids.  and when we left the hospital, they weren't there anymore, and that left a big void.  sounds kind of weird, but it's the way it is.  i am so grateful that these people came into my life.  without them, my babies might not be here and would definitely not be doing as well as they are today.

      today was a pretty good day, allergy hell aside!  they say the pollen count is up pretty high this year, and i'm certainly feeling it.    i pretty much wasted the day away, just like most saturdays (when aaron is at school).....i get up and nurse the babies, pour a bowl of cereal, change their diapers and give them breakfast...lock the house down and sleep on the couch for a while until collin comes out....then we read some harry potter (when mom's head isn't bursting with the pollen-laden allergy hell headache!  :(  ).  then we get around to lunch and usually go shopping afterward, mooching around (gotta love british english!  LOL) wal-mart or target, spending way too much money!  i love being lazy, tho, because it seems i don't have much time to truly be lazy (in MY sense of the word) throughout the week.    today my sis-in-law, andrea, came over to work on a scrapbook for her friend's baby shower.  it turned out really cute, and i think she might be a convert to scrapbooking....tho i need to get her married off and having babies so we can really set to work!  ;)   the babies are really starting to walk more.  they really are making the effort to walk to where they want to go, even if it is only for a few steps before plopping down and doing what comes so naturally to them!  they are just getting so darn big!  i don't mind, tho...the sooner they are able to get their own little asses everywhere, the better!  :)  tho, my buff arms might go by the wayside!  hehe  seriously, i've loved every stage of the kiddo...up to seven, that is!  ;)  i love watching them at each stage, marveling at how fast they grow up and being so proud of their accomplishments.  it's kind of hard to know that erin and griffin are my last babies, but it's so great to know that they're doing so well and that they're relatively healthy, and so am i.  so that's worth never having another baby in the house! :D  ok...suppose i shall call it a night.  not much happening around here tonight!  it's mighty quiet on the weekends when everyone has stuff to do!  LOL

      today's been a busy but quiet day.  i enjoy the bustling of order with toddlers.  they are so much fun sometimes....for instance, gage, the two year-old terror, made me nearly wet myself with giggles during our music time today.....i have a bucket o'instruments, purchased at the local wal-mart for ten bucks.  i pass out the instruments and try to get the kids to name them.  there is a pair of castanets that are shaped like ladybugs.  after we have passed the lot around for them to try, i ask them again what the names are for each instrument.  getting to the castanets, gage said:  'they're crap!'  hooohooo...i sometimes really love that boy!    now is some peace and quiet, and it's really odd to have it.  isn't there ANY adult out there willing to talk to me?!  hehehehe  quiet, schmiet!

      i'm procrastinating horribly today.....i should be doing anything but sitting here on the damn puter!  LOL  did you know that you could visit a profile and click on interests and find someone with like interests...then read their blog?  LOL  how fun is that?  i found other people who like  urlLink better than ezra !  LOL who knew?    k...that confirms that i need a life!  ;)  things on the agenda that i'm currently not doing by sitting here on my fat tushy: --writing an advertisement for getting new kids to watch --writing a newsletter for  urlLink Leaving Prints  --folding the mounds of laundry on the floor and putting them away --putting coupons into the four dollar coupon organizer i bought. --sending out coupons promised to friends --calling people to have Leaving Prints parties --anything of any importance whatsoever  at least i'm not complaining about life all that much.  it amazes me the amount of time people spend complaining, myself included.  life is pretty much ok right now.  i don't have a fever anymore. the sore throat is still around, but not impeding my diet coke intake anymore.....life is ok.  it's the ever-present rollercoaster of being a mommy of toddler twins, and babysitter to nine others at varying times.  it's going to have its ups and downs, and that's just the way it is.    we went out to play on our new playset today...which was a bit of a mistake, as the lawn dudes came to aerate (sp?? LOL) the lawn and we have little turd-shaped bits of mud on the grass...that, and it must have rained more than i thought as i lay in slumber yesterday, because the ground has more mud than i had anticipated...and so does my floor!  :)  it's ok, tho, because erin and griffin got the chance to climb up the rock wall and prove their stuff.  :)  that makes it all worthwhile!  :)  k...off to see about making some cookies or doing something else with these rotton boys! LOL  they're being good....but how good can you expect a four year-old and two two year-olds to be??  thank god for blue and dora! :)

      thursday morning already.  amazing how quickly the weeks go by.  it just seems like yesterday when i was starting this whole babysitting thing.  now the whole school year is almost gone, which means that i've been doing this for nearly nine months!  when i started this, the babies were still on monitors!  and that seems like forever ago!  thus far, i've only taken one sick day!  i've had some times where i didn't feel so well, but hadn't taken a single sick day....  elizabeth's mom told me the other day that she's going to stay home next year and not teach.  looks like i have another full-time spot to fill.  i need to email aaron and tell him with an advertisement.....the scary thing is that he just emailed me with some news about a fellow mom-of-twins!  LOL  scary.  must leave the blog for now as two of the five are screaming!  :(

      I'm working on re-doing my blog, if you havent' noticed.  I figured it's time I learned a little about html.....tho i'm not very good at it thus far!  LOL  feeling a bit better since i took the whole day off (yes, me...the one who's always working) to sleep, while aaron took care of his children.  he actually let me sleep in and not really have to get up and nurse them.  i had griffin come nurse and he fell asleep with me, as is the case on so many saturday and sunday mornings when he's the last to nurse.  it's good bonding time!  :)  my good girlfriend, rebecca won two tickets to norah jones....man, am i jealous!!  i saw norah jones when she was not as well-known....she opened up for the indigo girls.  stephenie and i talked through most of her concert (says this steph, blushing! LOL).  i really do like her, and have bought both her cd's.  :D  collin and i are up to chapter 13 of prisoner of azkaban.  we're hoping to finish it soon so that we can see the movie.  he's way excited about it, and bursts into tears every time we can't read it.  he had to be made understood that i didn't feel well enough to read last night. i told him that it wasn't fun that i didn't feel well and that if i had the choice i would definitely read to him!! oh, well....i suppose that i had to be told that, too as a youngster!  here's hoping for a good tomorrow...need to pick my sorry as up off the chair and resume flylady lifestyle!  ;)

      feeling like shit today....going to the docs at 1:30.  i've been running a low-grade temp and almost feel flu-like!  :(  i just hope it's something that they can give me some meds for and let me get on my way...instead of telling me it's viral and tell me i have to suffer it out!  LOL  not that i'm a fan of taking meds all the time, but i'm an even bigger fan of not feeling like shit all the time!  LOL  had a busy ol' weekend....collin and i read about 150 pgs in prisoner of azkaban (Harry Potter 3)....aaron put up our new playset...woohoo!  :)  the daycare kids sat this morning with their poor little faces plastered to the window, asking me when it would be finished.....stupid rain came in and now they won't be able to play today!  :(    at least i'm down to just the four year old girl, and the inferno child for the rest of the day.  it should make it a bit easier!

      i went to bed at 9:30 last night...LOL.  i feel pretty good today.  erin had occupational therapy this morning, and the therapist said that she would probably be released in another month!  woohoo!!  :)  i'm pretty excited about it....one step closer to having "normal" children (as normal as the kids from me can get!  ;)  )  i fell completely off my cleaning wagon yesterday, but am determined to get back on today.  yesterday was an OK day, tho, because i finished a few scrapbook pages from the crop in march.  i'm pretty proud of them.  i feel as though my scrapbooking style gets better and better with time.  most of my pages are pretty simple, but just have some oomph that you don't get without some eyelets and brads!  :)  loooove scrapbooking!!!  going to take the kids out in the pretty weather....my two are sleeping, but we'll take the monior out so that i can hear them!   on tap for today:  --fold laundry...urgh...they still won't just fold themselves like i tell them to!  if only i could be mrs. weasley and bewitch them into folding themselves!  LOL --make chicken nuggets, green beans, and fruit cocktail for lunch --figure out what to have the rest of the week and all next week --make spaghetti and meatballs, garlic bread, and italian mixed veggies for supper --clean bathrooms... --give some baby stuff to a friend having twins soon.  i think that's pretty much about it....i might throw in a batch of some sort of bread...banana perhaps?  or some cookies...sugar!!!  :)

      i'm tired today, but other than that, life is pretty good.....the baby stayed with his grandmother today, which is OK...the little persnickety man!  my mother-in-law loved her album.  she cried when she opened it, hugged me, and told me she loved me.  it was very sweet of her.  sometimes, however (here comes the negative side of me...LOL), i wonder if that's just because she was taken off her estrogen!  LOL....nah..she's very sweet, and i'm lucky to have her on my side.  neither of us is perfect, so we don't get along ALL the time, but for the most part, we do pretty well.  i got a pretty pair of pajamas from her for mother's day.   this is a tradition of sorts.    i've really got the scrapbook bug right now.  after the 20 pages i did this past weekend, i really want to get going again on it.  i just haven't had extra energy to do it.....we'll see...hopefully i can fit it into my fly-style schedule!  ;)  i do have one itty-bitty grump...ok...make it two....one's fairly bittersweet....the friend's in the house, if you know what i mean....which is bittersweet, because i think i'm really good with having survived two pregnancies, so i'm not wanting to tempt fate with another....but boy-oh-boy, i'm not really enjoying myself after a three or so month hiatus on that homefront!  LOL  my second grump is that i just wrote out all the invitations for a leaving prints show i was supposed to be doing on the 19th...and she gave me an email to day, asking to re-schedule....oh, well....at least she wants to reschedule, but i've got writer's cramp now!  LOL  oh, well...things could be a lot worse, couldn't they?    i've got diet coke (LOOOVE that husband of mine!) to get me through it.....for some women it's chocolate, and while i'm not against using chocolate for the days when you need it...my solice is diet coke!  :)

      whew....i'm nearly through with my mother-in-law's mother's day album, and i'm TIRED!!  my sister-in-law and i were up until 2 this morning working on it....and...guess who never sleeps in past oh....6:30?!  LOL  i know, i know.....it's self-imposed torture to still be nursing them this late in the game.......it's very hard to stop when you know they're your last.....and THEY don't want to stop right now, so i don't see many reasons to bother making them...............unless i win a trip outta here!  :P  i can't believe that i've completed nearly 40 6X6 pages in a week's time.....actually, it's about 43, because i did get a whopping three pages done on the baby boy album i'm tending to hawk off on some willing soul......i'm getting the scrapbook bug back....along with that comes the shopping bug, too........shhhh...don't tell aaron!  :)  i also read 60 pages of harry potter to collin....our new reading goal is to finish the third book before the movie comes out in the theater so we can go on a date......collin would really rather watch the movie before reading the book, but i don't!  LOL...mean, mean mommy! hehe  it's been a busy, but fruitful day, tho i feel off the flylady wagon again.....oh, well....my mother-in-law will hopefully like her gift, so i don't think flylady would object to that!  hehe  i got my mother's day present a week early.....it's a very pretty bracelet with austrian crystals on it that are similar to the kids' birthstone colors (amethyst and citrine)...it also has some sterling silver charms that spell "mom"....very pretty....got it last saturday at the craft fair......but it broke saturday night after the ben folds concert, so i had to get it repaired already.... :(  BUT...the woman who made it was just as sweet as she could be and fixed it for nothing!    i'm still working on trying to be happier in life....the bad thing is that last night, aaron and i fought again about housework stuff and the fact that he gets a break when i don't.....i know, i know...he used to do all the housework, but i still feel as though if we get it all done in the early afternoon right after he gets off work, that we could spend some couple time together later....oh, well....maybe we'll get around to that, too, eventually....  i'm really hoping to keep up with things as well if not better than i have for the last few weeks.  i really needed the motivation to get things in order around here.....sounds weird, but i think if i worked harder at that, i would actually not feel so stressed out and tired.  working harder usually equates getting more tired, but we'll see!  hehe  happy mother's day to all the mom's out there!  :)

      almond poppyseed bread is in the oven and all the kids are napping......at last some reprieve....  i know a lot of you sahm's really  love the idea of an earlier bedtime.....for me that happens, but i'm too tired by then to enjoy it!  LOL  for me, the best time of day is right here and right now.....the noon hour is when i finally get some peace and quiet....the only time of day where i can do anything for myself, so long as it is in the master suite!  LOL  sad but true, the majority of any of my free time is wasted sitting right here! ......mostly because i have no energy to enjoy this time, either.....at least i'm by myself!   i'm really going to try my hand at ebay this time...i really need to figure out how to do it, tho...i can sign up to do propay through Leaving Prints, but don't know whether that's acceptable in the ebay world....hmmmm....i've things to sell! hehehe  you know...i have no ponderances on world peace, or real grumps to lay out....my only ponderance right now is why people don't enjoy their lives more.....we have them to live, why can't we be happy with what we have?  take me, for instance......here is a list of the wonderful things i have.....   ........a loving husband, who wants me to be happy ..........three wonderful children, who...all except for a biter as of late (collin never did that!  LMAO), are great and seem to be much easier to deal with than most other children i know.... ..........a house, that, while might have a mold problem (holy shit, i hope not!!  please let it just be a rogue thing that grew on collin's wall!! ), is very comfortable and suits our needs. ...........a job that, while rough at times (none of my t-shirts are without baby food stains, but then again....they're just t-shirts....), allows me to see my beautiful wonderful children much more than i ever would were i still working downtown at a job where i was contentedly discontent. ...........TONS of scrapbooking supplies that i can use. ...........nap time with which to scrap ...........girls to talk on the phone with ..........a figure that's forgiving of the mounds of chocolate i've been giving it for the past  few months. ..........good hair, tho i'm not sure why everyone keeps saying that, but i thought i'd chuck that in. ........a mother-in-law whom i can actually get along with on most occasions. .........family that loves me for who i am, and doesn't rag me for not calling for a few weeks at a go.  i have all these wonderful things.....why am i not bursting at the seems with happiness?  and i'm not alone....many people are just like me.....they have good lives, but never seem to enjoy what they've got.  and many of these said people fool themselves into believing their life is really hunky-dory, but are always complaining about it!  i don't try to kid myself all that much...i always seem to deal with nasty shit....a firstborn only child who won't let me put him down without a fight, who decides to spit his lunch all over me.....a few family members who always hyercritical of others while all the while doing the same things.....a mother who says she wants to spend time with me, but then ignores me for friends on easter......  no...life's not always grand, but there are many things that i don't have to deal with......and i'm damn lucky that i don't.......here's a list........... ..........i've only known one person my entire life that was murdered. ........i've only known one person my entire life who committed suicide ..........i've only known two people with AIDS .........i've never been molested .........i've a roof over my head. ..........i've not had cancer. ...........we've not had to foreclose on anything ..........we've not been without a few good friends ..........i've never had to watch my baby die ..........i've never had a miscarriage ..........i've never been in a freaking car wreck! ...........i'm never really alone  i'm really very very lucky...........i need to find a way to realize this every day.  i need a way to make it a point to find something good in each day.  every day life generally sucks for most people.  we all carry the same amount of weight on our shoulders, it just takes on a different shape or has a different name.  but i think that there is a lot of good in everyone's lives, too.  and there must be a way to concentrate on that good so we don't feel miserable all the time!    and now, if you'll excuse me.....there just might be some almond poppyseed bread that's done baking!  :)

      hard to believe it's been a week since my last entry.....online diaries are so much easier than paper ones...i would have ditched the paper one a long time ago!  LOL  not much new happening in the life of the byers clan.....aaron's still teaching second grade and taking master's classes.  i will be so happy when those are done.....so will he!  LOL  but i'll be happy when i have my husband back to torture on saturday mornings with a to-do list!  ;)  collin is now a green belt in karate, but next wednesday he will be taking his test to become a blue belt.......we started talking about whether we should continue this, because he is starting to need some really expensive stuff for karate (like $75 a mo isn't expensive!!  LOL), and we don't want to pay the money out if he's just going to drop it.  so.....he and aaron had the 'if you're going to drop it, say it now...' talk last night, and he's told aaron he wants to be a black belt.  so....roll on karate!!  :)  the babies are crawling up on everything they can manage....it's getting quite scary....they're getting so big.  it's hard to believe that they're my last babies (speaking of which...i really need to call dr. tim for that tube-tying appointment so god doesn't sneak another one in on us!  LOL).  they're still going strong on the nursing...much to the chagrin of my family and friends.  more of them keep telling me to stop rather than applauding me for keeping it up.....i just LOVE unsolicited comments!!  :)    as for me......nothing of much to report here, either.  i did a craft fair with my leaving prints stuff this weekend, and it didn't really sell all that well.  i got my name out there a bit, tho, so i'm hoping that i'll drum up some business that way.  i need to write a newsletter still, but otherwise, it's just a matter of calling people....which i don't feel very strong at!  :S  you would think a born talker would have less trouble, but i feel like i'm asking people for a favor, which i don't really like doing......and i am asking them for a favor, so i don't really like doing it!  LMAO!!  i made a really cute album that i plan on selling somehow....someone introduced me to photobucket.com, so we'll see if i can get that rolling.....just another thing to add to the to-do list......

      today was a fairly good day...i got a bit of what the english would call a 'lie-in'....gotta love that, even if it was only until twenty past seven!  LOL  will get it tomorrow, too!  :)    then griffin got a really freaking nasty bite from gage....i just don't know what to do with the biting...it's getting way out of hand!  :(  my poor jan is finding it harder and harder to be a part-time single mom... :(  her boys are rotten to the core, and her oldest is manipulative....i hope that she can get things sorted out, because it's hard for me to see her so unhappy!  :(  some of it is that she's given into him for so long, but sometimes i worry that her oldest has some problems...hopefully it will get sorted out...  we went on a picnic with aaron's parents today.  it was fun...poor dante was in a fleece outfit!  LOL so i got him naked, because the poor dear was very warm....the kids all slept pretty well this afternoon, so that was good for me!  i got caught up with some of my NICU mom friends, so that's always good for my heart!  :)  i took the kids out to play in the neighbor's sprinkler...they were funny...erin just loves the water and went right in...the older boys 'convinced' him to go in, and he wound up sobbing his fool head off!  :(  poor boy....he's just like his older brother sometimes!  then we gave the babies spaghetti for supper (always give them sloppy stuff on nights when we're bathing them!  LOL) and they took showers with me....i'm getting spiders again, and was greeted by one in the shower!  :(  HATE spiders!!  anyway, now i'm off to wal-mart to buy whole milk and condoms!  LOL

      whew...am i tired!!  :)  it's a happy kind of tired, tho...not the usual dead-on-my-feet-these-kids-need-to-give-me-two-minutes-of-peace tired!  :D  i went to chicago yesterday to visit some of my online buddies.  we met through the preemie mom forum, and chat often with messenger.  andrea came up from cincinnati area to meet me, and then we piled all five (yes, five!!) kiddos in the car and head out.  the downfall is that it took us FIVE hours to get there, not including the half hour pit stop for lunch!  LOL  it was a blast, tho....we got up there about 5:30 and the kids all played for about two hours.  we then went to pizza hut and grubbed.  after that, we played hell to find a hotel (gotta love concerts and the taste of chicago!).  we gave up after about three or four stops, and headed east into indiana.  i got the notion in my head that we might as well try to drive on to indy, but gave up when we had two hours left to go.  my eyes were starting to cross!  so we each took a bed at a holiday inn express, and slept for a few hours.  the downside is that the kiddos, who had been sleeping for about two hours, woke up and decided it was playtime!  LOL  all in all it was a good trip.  i am so happy that i got to meet my girlfriends face-to-face.  it kind of makes the friendship real, you know?  not that my online buddies aren't real friends, but it's wonderful to SEE them...give them REAL hugs....hear them laugh....really see what their kids do.....i loved it!

      this week has been interesting to say the very least.  some good some bad, but i will concentrate on the good things right now!  :)  monday was absolutely fab!  i went to the dave matthews band concert with jill, gage's mom, as a sort of thank you for extra watching.....well...we left, and it was starting to sprinkle....we go to the venue, and it was starting to piss down rain....so we decided that whatever happens, we were going to make our own fun!  we get patted down and hand our tickets to the girl to scan, and she asks jill "how many people in your party?"  jill says "2"..."see that man behind me" the lady says....here we are looking at eachother as if to say:  "what the hell did we do?  we've not even been inside yet!"  the guy asks us "how many people in your party?"  "two" we repeat...."how would you like to sit in the pavillion tonight?"  "of course," we say!  he gave us tickets to sit in the pavillion....and they weren't just tickets in the farthest point....we were 27 rows from the stage!  was absolutely fab!  tuesday my parents dropped my youngest brother, joshua, off at the airport so he could go to honduras on a missions trip.  they then came up to see us for a bit.  was nice to see them.  i don't get to see them often because they live three hours away from me.  i have missed so much of my little brothers' growing up....that makes me sad, but it would also be really tough on me to live much nearer to them.  when dysfunction rears its ugly head, it's hard for me to keep my nose out!  LOL  but it has been a good few days nonetheless.  now i need to hop back on the flylady wagon, and clean stuff up a bit...i have half-finished projects lying about.... for which i am queen!  :)

      happy father's day to all the fathers out there!  i hope that aaron had a good day.  i am not much of a wife and mother, as he did the cooking for breakfast this morning!  LOL  he makes better sunday breakfasts than i do, and besides...i was so wiped out from being up until midnight doing his father's day album!  whew!  it would have been easier to do if he were out of the house a little more.  i waited until the last minute, but it's very hard to keep anything a secret around here! LOL  at any rate, i will post a pic of the album when i get the chance.  i'm quite proud of it, as i've never actually made a book myself before.  he liked it, so it was worth it!  :)  so, to sum up the weekend, i spent most of it working on his album....nearly all day yesterday!  and today we went to aaron's parents' house for a cookout.  aaron's mom bought his dad a bike for a father's day/anniversary present, and she kept it at our house for a few days so aaron's dad would be surprised.  and he was surprised, so she was happy about that.  the rest of the day was spent lounging around a bit and taking care of babies.  i did whip up a batches of rice krispie treats and toll house bars to take for the cookout!  :)  quite the little betty crocker i've become sometimes!  LMAO  tonight i am watching gage so that jill can go to the dave matthews concert with her friend jennifer.  i think they will have fun! gage was not excited about spending the night with me at first, but warmed up after jill left, giving me snuggles of his own free will!  :)  love gage lovin's!  :D  the kids have been a bit under the weather recently....i hate it when they get the sniffles.  i always worry that the other shoe will drop and we'll wind up back in the hospital....it's not an all-consuming fear, but it's always in the back of my mind.    anyway, off to watch toy story and put erin and collin down for the night.  probably will involve some harry potter reading, too!

      woohoo!  it's friday!  and it's been a pretty good day so far....aside from the fact that miss erin won't take a nap!  i really am having a difficult time keeping their schedules at a manageable pace.....now they like to take a nap in the morning, but i'll be damned if they'll lay down when everyone else's taking a nap!!  *pout*  i'm really excited.  my friend andrea and i started a new  urlLink premature baby forum !  andrea did all the work to get it set up....i feel bad about that, but she did a very good job! we're excited to have this new start!  it's wonderful to be able to connect with a wonderful group of people who have gone through so many similar things as i have with parenting.  so far we've had six other people other than ourselves join the forum!  i'm really happy about this!  :)  i'm excited about the weekend.  tonight i have an interview with a pregnant mother, and friend of gage's mom.  she wants someone two days a week for her girl in the fall.  this makes me a bit nervous, but i think that everything will be fine, should she choose us.  i would really like to get another kiddo gage's age to watch as well.    it looks like tomorrow will be spent working on aaron's father's day album.  i have selected some photographs to use, and spent some time last night looking for quotes to use with it as well.  i really hope that he likes this!  :)  and sunday we will go to aaron's parents' house to celebrate father's day.  aaron's mom bought his dad a bike for a father's day/anniversary present.  he has been having problems with his feet and can no longer run anymore.  i hate that for him, as he used to run races and everything.  but hopefully this will help keep him in shape.  nothing much new to report.  i need to go look for  urlLink more quotes  to use in aaron's album!

      i'm tired today....*yawn*.....i went to jan's to scrapbook again last night.  i am making aaron an album for father's day.  it's my first ever accordion (accordian??) album (thanks to a search, i was introduced to  urlLink shez' scrapbook forum ! funny how that works, eh?), and i have to say that it isn't bad for my first whack at it!  it's not perfect, by any means...and i'm a perfectionist by nature, but it will just have to do!  i also used metallic rub-ons for the first time to 'age' an accordion tag.  i'm fairly pleased with how that turned out.  now i just have to dig up some pics, print them out if need be, and decide what else i'm going to do.  it has four pages, so i've decided to use a page for each of us.  (this is still a very weird thing for me...getting used to being a family of FIVE, not three...hehe) i think i'm going to look for a pic of each kiddo with their daddy....we'll see how it goes.  but not only did that keep me awake until well after midnight...then griffin has had a bout of diarrhea and that has made his little bum a bit raw, so he was an unhappy camper and spent the rest of the night with us.  poor little man...he's still a bit unhappy this morning.  aaron said that he didn't go to sleep right away, which surprised me, because i went right back to sleep after he latched on.....gotta love allergy medicines!  LOL  poor aaron!    here's hoping for some nice weather today so that i can get these kiddos out of the house to play!!

      i'm a bit tired today.  it seems as though my body is messed up as far as the clock goes...for some reason, i can't get to bed before 11pm.  not a good thing when you wake up at 6:10 am!  makes for a tired girl in the morning!  oh, well. as ever, could be worse, eh?  it's raining outside today, which means it's television and movie day chez miss steph!   LOL  i will do something with the booger boy.  i might bust out the paints today to see what he comes up with!  at two, gage is already painting actual shapes and things.  not sure if this is advanced, but it's great to see him develop like that.

      life has been pretty much standard around here.  nothing much new going on at all.  but sometimes this is a really good thing!  LOL  i have made some plans that i'm getting excited about, so i guess that there is something new!  LOL  i have a few online friends, of whom i live in the middle.  one's near cincinnati, and one's near chicago.  well....the girl near cincy's going to meet up with me here and we're going to drive to chicago to meet her!  i've never seen either of them face-to-face, but talk with them nearly every day, so i'm really excited to meet them and their children!  we all have a lot in common, and get along very well online, so i'm really excited to meet them in person!  we met on the preemie forum...their kids are older than mine, so it's always reassuring to see older preemies.  i'm very excited to have this to look forward to!

      today has been decent so far.  the babies are off their schedule, but it could be worse, eh?  last night my sis-in-law came over and we made cards for a card swap we're in.  i feel so rejuvenated with scrapbooking now that i did those cards!!  i want to hide out in my closet and scrap the day away.  hopefully i'll get the chance to do some either today or tonight.  we still haven't made up our mind what we want to do today.    my good friend rebecca bought the babies new swimsuits.  erin is now the proud owner of a two piece!  LOL  she struts around the sprinkler park like she's big stuff!  i can't wait until i can get some good pics of her in it to show off.  she's too hysterical!  she's so tiny still, but has been getting a little potbelly from eating so much lately.  so, from the back, she's totally cute, with a teeny little bottom and back.  from the front, she's a potbelly with her strawberry hanging out.  she's still as cute as she can be, but it's definitely humorous!    griffin, on the other hand, is a bit more like collin.  he's very apprehensive of the water, and takes a longer time to get used to it.  he's still a bit more daring than collin, but he's definitely not as brave as erin!    i'll definitely take the camera next time i go to the sprinkler park!!

      today was a quiet day, aside from a doc's appointment in the morning.  the babies had their developmental peds appointment today.  unlike many of the other appointments we've had there, they were very upbeat and happy with the babies' progress!  i can't tell you how happy this made me!  griffin is now getting really close to bridging the gap between where he would be had he been full term and where he should be at the age he really is.  well...he is for gross motor development, at any rate!  erin, however, is getting really close to bridging the gap with fine motor skills.  it's funny how i forget that the babies have come so far from the little half-baked peanuts that they were.  they never cease to amaze me, and i love them so much!

      feeling a bit back to normal today.  i'm still a little stressed out.....for as bad as it sounds, i would really like a break from my family...i think i would be a better mommy and wife if i did.  and, the fact that aaron will have thursday and friday as a break, and then turn around and have another six day break in july kind of makes me a teensy-weensy bit jealous....i have to admit it...i'm really jealous.  i want to do something like that.  even if i took a week off at this point, i would still have to be with my own children.    i suppose i really should give up the nursing, but i don't want to really do that either.  perhaps the title of my post should be "on having my cake and eating it, too"....i don't want to give up the nursing...i don't feel that any of the three of us are ready yet.  i want to be able to comfort and provide for them in that way still.  and i think the WHO would support me on this!  ;)  did you know that they recommend nursing until age THREE???  not sure i want to give it that long, but i'm thinking two is a good possibility.  i know this might sound odd, but i really think that trying to go that long will be ok.  if they should happen to not want to nurse until then, so be it, but i will open to nursing until then...and, gasp! perhaps longer.  we'll see.  i actually cropped some pics this morning, and tried to plan out a few pages.  i'm hoping to get to it sometime soon.  i would really love to get a few more pages in the 2001 album done...perhaps all of them.  i really NEED to start on the babies' albums, as they are now (well, in two days at any rate) sixteen months old, and i've done nada, aside from collect stuff for it.  i have all kinds of pastels and bright papers for when i do get started!  and most of it matches!!  LOL..i swore i wouldn't do that, but here i am!  tee hee  ok...novel for today should cease.  i'm sure all of you are bored to tears now.  feel free to post comments on how much of sorry girl i've become!  LOL   Looking for quote on trains for a scrapbook page.  I found this very good quote.  I always need to find a perspective on things when Zookeeping!  ;)  and those germans always have a point, now that their free from hitler!  ;) He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.  ~Friedrich Nietzsche

      upon logging in today, i realized that i've hit 100 posts!  funny how something like that will make you giggle a bit.    anyway....on to the day.....i have to say that i've had better ones....in the past, i've been known for complaining a lot, not that i've never had anything to complain about.  life just sucks sometimes.  but i do need to complain now, so that maybe i'll feel better about it.  and it's my blog, anyway, right?!  LOL  this morning was pretty crappy.  first...i'm a few pounds heavier on top than i used to be (not such a bad thing most of the time..until swim suit tops are too small!), and still no slimmer on bottom (lovely little children....that is some curse of motherhood, eh?).  hence, NONE of my swimsuits (only one of which is newer than five to nine (gulp!) years old) looks even remotely close to something i would want anyone seeing me in....AND.....who was the sad mofo who decided that we must shave the pubes?  i'd like to kick his sorry ass!  so....that started the day off just peachy.  second....gage....he's two....i don't really need to go any further, but the little man lost his sandals right before we decided to leave the house for the sprinkler park.  took ten minutes before collin finally found them....grrrrrr.  third....the friend who was supposed to direct me to said sprinkler park listened to aaron when he told her falsely that i knew where i was going.  fourth...backing up to before the sad swimsuit selection, there was no milk or pop-tarts in the house this morning...so no breakfast for miss steph until she got to mcdonalds'.  i buy the super size diet coke and two cinnamon rolls...nothing bad happens and the cinnamon rolls lie nicely in my stomach when the friend decides to sit right by my drink and knock it off the wall on which it sat, drenching my ONLY shorts with HALF my diet coke.   fifth...i come home to aaron, who makes fun of me and is mad that i'm in such a shitty mood.  sixth...erin, my lovely little princess, pees all over the bathroom floor while i'm preparing to give the younger three a bath to knock off some of the icky sprinkler park water.  ok....off to read some harry potter to collin before i spontaneously combust.....ok..i suppose it wouldn't be spontaneous, as i've been boiling and heating up all damn day....but i'll explode, i swear!  LOL  so....here's hoping that the afternoon holds better things for miss steph.....crossing my fingers, throwing salt over my shoulder, grabbing the rabbit's foot....

      on  urlLink Flylady.net ......  i think i go in big spurts of being over the top.....today's feat was to clean the baseboards in the kitchen with a toothbrush and to sweep and mop the floor....in broad daylight....on a WEEKDAY.    i also cleaned my scrap area...no small feat, as i've managed to cram more things than should ever fit into a three by six by six space in a closet!  LOL  don't get me wrong....i love my scrapbooking stuff...but it really sucks when i go through phases of being less than orderly!  soo....hopefully i'll stay on the wagon for a while and get everything cleaned up again....i've some chores left over from yesterday, but tomorrow's a leaving prints day, so hopefully i'll get some stuff done then.    here's hoping i get a newsletter out by tomorrow night!  was supposed to have it done by tonight (according to myself! LOL), and it didn't get done.....need to put flylady in the middle of my leaving prints work!  hehehe  roll wagon, roll!!!!

      the weekend has been decent so far.  aaron had class again yesterday...we only have until october before he's completely done!  woohoo!!!  so the morning was spent lounging around and taking care of the kidlets.  i took collin to michael's to do the kiddo craft project.  we are now happy owners of a fuzzy poster with a multi-colored moon on it.  he did a really good job!  :)  after that, we went to taco bell to pick up lunch, where we came back and ate with rebecca.  we then played around with paper clay and shrinky dinks to see what kind of fun things we could come up with for rebecca's card swap that's taking place later this month.  i'm excited about it.  i wound up not using the shrinky dinks (i don't think that the sizzix likes shrink plastic all that well....), but opted to use the confetti die i bought and make many colors of confetti to use with the card.  will post when finished!  :)  i went to see harry potter 3 with the big boy last night.  i have to admit, i wasn't impressed!  the first two did so much better with sticking to the book and did a much better job at explaining the plot.  had i not just read the book, i would have been a little lost....oh, well. it was fun to go on a date with just collin.  we bought the big-ass bucket o'popcorn, two big drinks (i even let him drink.....caffiene!!), and got some starburst.  it was a fun time.    today i cantored at church.  funny...people still look at me like i've three heads when i tell them that collin is my son and that i've two more at home, and a husband....."aren't you in high school?" they ask...."um...no...i know."  i respond.  it's pretty funny!  i actually had someone argue with me once at the mcdonald's counter!  "surely you're his big sister...you did not just say mom!" the person behind the counter said.  "no...he's mine...i've the stretch marks to prove it!  and we've another baby on the way!"  i say.  oh, well.  perhaps i should hawk off some miracle cream....it's called no shower for a few days of the week!  hehe  griffin, i've decided, will be my musician.  we sing the ABC's to him, and he really tries to sing it back.  it's really cute!  i also have this bucket o'instruments from the daycare that they play with.  griffin and erin both have figured out the kazoo already!  :)  they know that they have to vocalize into it before it will make noise.....don't worry...they've all the standard horns and whistles down pat, too!  hehe  i love being a mommy!

      on feeling shitty.....  i feel a bit down right now.  there's not a true reason why..it just is happening.  it seems so cyclical.  one minute i feel like i can handle things...the next minute, wham!  down.  it's odd.    here's hoping some good sleep will help me out....i don't like this at all.  hopefully tomorrow will bring a better mood.  allergy meds will help, too, no doubt.....i feel like shit all the time, and i work all the time (daycare kid left at 7 tonight!!  grrrrrrr....), so i know that i've good reason to feel down.    so many scrapbook supplies, so little energy!  pout, stamp foot!  bucking up, bucking up.......

       On having a kiddie pool....   few things have given me a bigger giggle recently than this morning's kiddie pool adventure.  i'm watching elizabeth and her older brother, who resents the fact that he's at my house.  causes a bit of trouble while he's here, and there you have it....well...being the girl that i am, i try my hardest to do at least one fun activity with the snot while he's held captive at my zoo.  so...i check my trusty rust  urlLink Children's Busy Book  by Trish Kuffner, and find a penny toss game using the kiddie pool and a butter tub.  you float the butter tub on the water in the shallowly filled butter tub and make a game of tossing pennies into it.  it was fun....until erin decided to climb in with her clothes on!  LOL  where's the camera when you need it???  so...after the game, i decided to let everyone take off their shoes and socks and take a foot bath in the pool.  was too fun, and i'm glad that i spent the minimal effort and dollars in doing it.

      On having a Girl in the House.........  boy, oh boy, am i really glad that erin will (probably) not have any sisters!!  i can't even begin to imagine the mayhem life would be!  hehe  erin's always been the girl with her own agenda.  in the nicu, she was the 'no-touch' baby, displaying her anger at being messed with by holding her breath, causing alarms to go off and nurses to come running.    these days, her anger is displayed on a much more vocal level.  i'm glad that we do not drink out of glass cups....because they would all be broken with the decibals and pitch that her little voice takes on when pissed off royally!  and...she's conniving already.  this morning i finally realized how things work.  all this time i thought that griffin was the mean brute, taking toys away from his little sister.  boy, was i ever wrong!    it actually goes like this:  erin has toy.  erin thinks her toy is the best.  erin waves toy in front of griffin with a very smug aire.  griffin takes wonderful toy.  erin screams bloody murder.  this is where it stops from this day forward.  this is how the sequence of events used to go:  griffin is reprimanded.  mom gives toy back to erin and commences with the duties that she was called away from due to said infraction of sharing rules.  erin starts screaming bloody murder again. mom realizses that erin has given griffin back the toy, but now wants it back.  i'm in trouble on so many levels here!  at least i had three brothers and know how a lone girl works.  sheesh!

      back to the grind....not too bad, but busy nonetheless.  today, i tried to teach the two year-old the color red.  he knows his shapes, but has a hard time with the colors.  i also tried to teach him that it's not nice to pinch, hit, or kick.  we'll see how the learning goes on either of those.  all efforts as of late seem to be for not, really.    i'm trying to figure out my ruddy scanner.  it scans things totally off-color.  anyone have any ideas?  it seems to happen most with metal embellishments on the scrapbook pages i'm going to try and hawk off on ebay.....let me know if you have any ideas.  the babies were a bit sick this weekend.  i think it might be allergies, but who knows.  they are still doing very well considering they were so incredibly little at birth, but i still worry like a maniac.  that all goes with being a mommy, i suppose.    check out griffin's latest feat.....i really do have monkeys on my hands!  LOL    i know i'm in trouble.

      chalk it up to being tired....chalk it up to the fact that it's friday, but dag.....i'm tired.....and i have sooooo much shit to do before tonight!!&nbsp; the good new is that i will likely be off work by 3:30 or so, so that will be good for getting on the road and into st. louis before it's all too late....  wish me luck...the babies don't really travel well....i'm thinking that we're looking at some sleepless nights....they were AWFUL last weekend, so i'll settle for just bad this weekend!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; thank goodness i have aaron to help this time....  i will be back on monday with a full report of hotwire.com and their set-up with hotels....i got a room at the sheraton in downtown st. louis for 68.00...when it would normally cost 129.00......wish me luck on that, too!&nbsp; ;)  have a good weekend!!&nbsp; :)

      it is currently 12:25, and i've recently gotten back from a night of scrapbooking with the girls!&nbsp; i'm way excited!!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; it is not often that i get out of the house, so this was a real treat!   for those of you who read this thing who scrapbook, i'm doing a class on fibers next week, so i'm getting things in gear for that....i've made a card, a tag, and a memo board page that i'm going to use.....i still want to do one more layout using fiber, and then i think that i'll be good to go!&nbsp; i'm really excited about trying to get the LP thing going.&nbsp; i think i have a lot to offer as far as enthusiasm and shared techniques, so i hope that this catches on!&nbsp; :)   ok...off to bed...still need to fold clothes and pack for st. louis....the ship leaves at 5:30ish tomorrow night!&nbsp; :)

      the past few days have been extremely busy.&nbsp; we went out for our anniversary, but i felt sick after i ate, so i couldn't get any groove on... :(&nbsp; how tragic!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but i ate the toblerone cheesecake the next day for lunch, and it was yummy!&nbsp; :)  my friend jan has been in the hospital again.&nbsp; i really get scared for her when she gets sick.&nbsp; it's not just like the sniffles....she could bleed to death at any given moment when she gets sick... :(&nbsp; it's really one thing having her move two hours away, but it's something entirely different to think that she could pass away!  collin earned his purple belt in karate!&nbsp; he really makes me proud with the way he's so into doing well.&nbsp; i'm really happy that he's one step closer to getting a black belt.&nbsp; he really has come into his own since the babies were born and since he's started karate....he still cries at the drop of a hat, and still whines a bit when things don't go his way, but he's really getting more mature.  i'm really starting to put myself into my leaving prints business.&nbsp; i just emailed out a schedule of classes that i'm going to hold, and people are responding!&nbsp; cross your fingers for me, as i really would love to do more of this type of work, and less babysitting....no offense to the families i watch......&nbsp; ;)  we're going to st. louis this weekend!!&nbsp; i'm really excited...i booked the sheraton downtown, and we're going to be doing things like going to the zoo (it's free!), the science center (also free!), and grant's farm (also free!!&nbsp; LOL).&nbsp; there is just so much you can do in st. louis, and it's very family-oriented.&nbsp; loooove it.  alright everyone, now go update your blogs!!&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; indigoblog.tk is the ONLY one of you who's updated lately!!!&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; i take it back...nainsworld.blogspot.com has also updated!&nbsp; sorry nain!&nbsp; ;)

      today is my 7th wedding anniversary!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; it's amazing to think that it really has been that long!&nbsp; so we'll have a date tonight.&nbsp; dunno what we'll do, but we'll have fun!   aaron's back from his vacation....he's complaining that he's tired.....i feel SO SORRY him!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; it must be so difficult to not have to do anything but watch ball games every night.&nbsp;   i went to my hometown this weekend for a family reunion.&nbsp; it was a lot of fun, but very tiring.&nbsp; it's so much fun to show off my little family, but my little trio of kids doesn't really like to spend the night out of their own bed....the babies were up constantly on saturday night, making it a very tiring night for me.&nbsp; i don't blame them, though, it must be weird to have their daddy gone and then spend the night at someone else's house!  aaron brought me back a hoochie-mama t-shirt from wrigley field.&nbsp; it's very cute.  i'm honestly glad that he was able to get a vacation in....but he knows that i'm now due a vacation!&nbsp; ;)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      well....today's the start of it....aaron's five day vacation...four ball parks in five days....see?&nbsp; i do let aaron do whatever he wants.....*winks*  so...i must admit that i'm envious....i really can't wait until i can do something similar....  call me awful, but i would love to have five days away from the fam....somehow going on a vaca with the whole fam damily just doesn't sound all too appealing...it sounds like work!&nbsp; hehe  so, i'm getting the sheets all washed and collin's going to be sleeping in my bed for the next five nights or so!&nbsp; LOL  &nbsp;

      this weekend was a good one....i did little but be a big bum and scrapbook a little.&nbsp; aaron runs circles around me...like always! &nbsp; i'm doing a late mother's day gift for my step-mom, who's more like a mom to me than my biological mom is.&nbsp; i'm hoping to get it done by friday so that i can give it to her!&nbsp; i think she'll like it....it's not as 'perfect' as i'd like for it to be, but i'm hoping she'll like it all the same.&nbsp; we'll see! &nbsp; erin had a fever this weekend...my poor girlie-girl....we think that she's got an ear infection, but we'll see what it is.&nbsp; mr. dante turned up with a low-grade fever today, too....but i felt a tooth trying to pop through, so i'm sure that's what his problem is.&nbsp; another day in zookeeper paradise.&nbsp; LOL &nbsp; it's not bad, really.&nbsp; i'm used to the crying!&nbsp; i just hate that the babies don't feel well.&nbsp; it's so hard to feel a feverish baby who can't tell you what exactly is hurting him/her.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      nothing much new to report...same stuff, different day....life is quiet without the old gage running around!  LOL  i might have another newborn starting soon....we shall see how it all goes!  i might be checking myself into the stress center soon!  LMAO  we had a picnic outside yesterday.  it was a lot of fun.  jan brought over some KFC as a payment for watching her boys in the morning.  it was very nice of her.  erin was an absolute trip!  she was mowing down on the chicken like nobody's business.  and then, she stepped on the styrofoam plate that we had put her foot on and slipped.  i laughed so hard and accidentally rolled over onto collin's food!  LOL  it was too funny.  oh, well...everything's washable!!  hehe  collin and i started reading the Order of the Phoenix a few days ago.  we had just finally finished the Goblet of Fire.  collin really likes harry potter, and stalks me with his book in tow!  it's so funny!

      i'm not sure what it is....but i sit here at quarter to midnight, unable to really sleep, tho i am a bit tired....gage is gone all week, so a little reprieve is under way.....  you know...sometimes i wonder why my life is the way it is...how i let some relationships go and hold onto others....and for me, sometimes i tend to let the relationships go that meant a great deal at one time, but have become very unhealthy.  i usually get to a place where the other person makes me feel less of myself...for a while i think it's them...and then i realize it's ME.  i've LET this person make me feel bad about myself, and haven't spoken up until it was way too late to save the relationship.  everyone has things to say....sometimes they're exactly what you need to hear, and other times, they cut to the quick.  and what's funny, is that sometimes neither party realizes the potential of what they're saying.  sometimes it's like a tiny scratch...you put up with it, because it's not so painful...and it goes away.  other times, you get scratched again and again, and then get to the point where you no longer can take it....and wind up wounding the paw of the cat who scratched you so deeply that they never come back for you to pat them again.  it's kind of like the words of two people with whom i was so very close, but by whom i got hurt so many times.  i don't hate these two people....and sometimes parts of me wishes that i could get these two back in my life...but things would never be what they once were.  nor would i want them to be.  for me, i think sometimes it would be enough to let them know that i'm thinking of you.  when i buy a movie that i've heard them talk endlessly about, or finish a scrapbooking page that i know they'd be proud of.  but never would i want things to be the way they were toward the end, for i wouldn't want to feel that way about myself again.   it's funny, the twists and turns that life takes.  every day i'm learning to depend more and more upon myself...and to like who i am.

      it's been a fairly rough week in zookeeperland....the children's biting is at an all-time high, and i'm just down in the dumps in general....i'm beginning to feel the need for a break, but don't know how to achieve it.....a nursing mother with a daycare doesn't get breaks, even with a supportive husband at home!  there are too many poopy diapers to change, too many kids to feed, too many kids who want harry potter read to them at night....and that leaves steph with very little energy left over.... :(  i know i must sound like a whiney-baby to some, but everything i say is the damn truth!!  dammit!!  LOL  i seriously love the kids i watch, and i certainly love my own kids...i'm totally wrapped up in being a mommy right now, but breaks are very good for the soul....  so...that being said....if i had a vacation right now, and could go anywhere.....where would i go??  hmmmm.....  i think i would love to go away to someplace like south haven, michigan, where it's not too cold, not too hot....and sit on the beach with a lighthearted, easy-reading novel....drink copious amounts of diet coke....sleep in as long as i wanted.....aaaaahhhh...  or....i might hop a flight somewhere....  'get out the map, get out the map and lay your finger anywhere down...we'll give the finger to those that we pass on the way out of town....'  gotta love the indigo girls!  ;)

      back to the old grind today....sometimes holiday weekends aren't all that they're cracked up to be....especially when said holiday weekend includes the almight butwin family reunion....yes..they're real name is butwin!  LOL  formerly a three-day event, comprised of beer, the great race (which we thankfully do not participate in, as my father-in-law fell and broke his shoulder during one ill-fated fourth of july), a slide-show, and over-priced, IMAT (it'll make a turd) status food....don't forget more beer, they're slovakian, you know, this year it was mercifully condensed to a one-day event.  the only thing that makes it more fun for me is to watch people with my kids and answering questions about my kids (yes, i've decided that there's not much more to my life than my kids right now...).  OH, but don't forget the perpetual rain and humidity...no great butwin family event would be without it!  can you tell i love this thing?  LOL  it's neat that they want to do this, but i would really love it if they condensed it further to perhaps a fun-filled evening of food and alcohol....just a suggestion....  that way, i probably would only have to deal with the lovely grumpy babies who are so off schedule and over-stimulated that they throw themselves down on the ground with a screaming fit every time we turn around.  i really do love my kiddos, but every good mommy needs a break!  LOL  anyway, yesterday was our true break...we went to cookie cutter's to get griffin's first hair cut....sniff, sniff...he's such a big boy!  his little cheeks look a little bigger now that his face is framed with a bit of hair....it's very fun to watch them grow up, but it's kind of sad all the same...definitely more sweet in the bittersweet.    we also went to kohl's, where we got some things that we'd been needing...aaron got some shorts (he was down to two pair that he could wear in public!) and i got myself a new bathing suit...whew!!  even tho my stomach isn't wash-board flat, i still don't feel as bad about walking around in this suit...  anyway, that's my holiday weekend in a nutshell!  hope everyone else had a good one, too!

      the babies were discharged from PT today....now we need to get griffin going with his OT skills and we'll be theraptst-free.  it's kind of sad to see the PT go...she's been with us since before the babies could roll over!  and now they're toddling about the house like they own the place!!  i'm very proud of my kiddos, and extremely grateful that they've had such terrific people to help them along the way!    .......now....if only i could get griffin to stop biting others, i would be in daycare utopia!  ;)

LOL  the crazy babies woke up at 6:15 after i went to bed at 1:30! grrr!  LOL  anyway, my birkenstocks should be shipped out today...wayhay!  here's hoping they fit well!

LOL i thought a full-term kid couldn't top the stubbornness of a preemie!! LOL oh, well....thank goodness it's friday! :D  my fibers class went really well last night. i think that i'll like being able to teach those sorts of classes, provided that i will get more people. don't get me wrong...i loved being able to hang out with that one girl for awhile, she was very nice....LOL anyway...here's a pic of what i taught.... :)   i'm still wondering what kinds of things i could sell on ebay....i'm such a dork! LOL and i can't wait for my echeck to clear so i can claim my damn birks!! LOL if i would have known how long it was going to take, i would have paid by CC!!  i'm really excited about the weekend coming up. i am having girlfriends over to spend the night and swim in the community pool. and we might get a little drinky after the kids go to bed tomorrow night!! ;) beer before liquor, never sicker.........

      ok....the promised update on the weekend....  we live about four hours or so from st. louis, in the indianapolis area.  you take the great I-70 west through terre haute.....well....about twenty minutes west of terre haute....erin pukes....we chalk it up to being carsick or overeating, clean her up, and promise to stop at the next wal-mart for some lysol.  no big deal....we just won't be eating KFC for a little while now!  ;)    we stop at the big K and get some lysol and some swim trunks for the boys...i'd forgotten them.  bad mommy!!  LOL    anyway, griffin starts puking!!  i'm not sure how many times each of them puked during the what turned into six hour trip, but all we wanted to do was to get to the hotel and sleep whatever this was off!!   well, griffin threw up on saturday morning for the last time....but erin threw up until sunday morning.....  all the planning, the money spent, and all that happened was collin and i got to go up in the arch and we all got to see a very strange mall called st. louis mills that had an archiver's.  other than that.....we spent the weekend in the hotel room or in the van....  .....so much for a vacation!  and....remarkably enough....erin hasn't thrown up since we left st. louis!  nutty babies!!  they're little terrorists, i tell ya!
