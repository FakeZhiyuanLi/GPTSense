       Just saying a quick howdy...    Don't worry Krys, I won't hog your space. Although I totally disagree on the Dr Pepper thing...all Dr Pepper tastes like crap. :p

        What is it? Why is it?? It made me think as I sat down to drink my can of Pepsi Max... (bought for me by my mum,   I would never buy it by my own choice) 'Maximum taste, No sugar' My arse...  I think, if you were on a diet, you wouldn't be drinking a large amount of fizzy drinks... Full of calories. "Diet ones aren't" I hear you say... Maybe not, but they contain a whole load of fake crap to substitute the sugar, and as a result, taste disgusting. hence the Diet Dr Pepper picture. Dr Pepper is perhaps the greatest drink ever created,  diet  Dr Pepper, tastes like shit. If I was ever on a diet, I just wouldn't bother. Surely if you were serious, you'd be drinking fruit juice, and water. There was even that news report about something in Diet Coke possibly causing cancer, proving the fact it's full of fake crap. A friend of mine (and I hope she won't be offended) drinks diet stuff all the time, she says its so she doesn't get fat or whatever, she's perfectly fine anyway, but what would a can of normal coke do? Seriously? Just drink normal stuff! It tastes so much better and doesn't contain crappy sugar substitutes!

        Well, my tickets just came through the post for the  urlLink Franz Ferdinand  concert in October! How excited am I?! Not to mention Gordy's coming with me!! Double w00t! Anyway, I'm getting to be a bit of a concert whore, it may not be apparent thanks to the serious lack of concerts but I think it's true. Since going to the  urlLink Space  concert at the  urlLink Academy 3  I've realised that concerts in smaller venues are absolutely brilliant! So no more M.E.N arena for me if I can help it. The past few months I kept checking the updates of  urlLink ticketline  to see if any of the bands I like were playing... But no... And then I check this week and  urlLink Keane  and Franz Ferdinand are on at the  urlLink Apollo ! Unfortunately Keane have sold out, but hey, Franz Ferdinand are far better, and I doubt I could convince Gordy to come all the way down here to see Keane :p    A bit of a gaming session was had today... I've been playing games on and off for a bit now, but not half as much as I used to. Now the  urlLink Gamecube 's in Ryan's room I seem to have decided to play it more. Must be the big TV and surround sound :p I started off with  urlLink Re0  which as I said in an earlier post, I have been playing anyway. From there I progressed to  urlLink Eternal Darkness  and got the past the bit I was stuck at :D Soon I'll have completed that fully :D Then I decided to restart  urlLink Skies Of Arcadia , as Mumbo had been praising it quite a bit the previous day. So there you have it, let's hope my gaming streak continues, I do quite enjoy it :p

      Dnt u h8 it wen ppl tlk lke ths on frums, e-mals n MSN mssngr? I know I do... Fair enough, in a text message you need to conserve the space you have, and so shorter words are used in order to get what you want to say across. In MSN Messenger and e-mails it's just plain annoying. It really doesn't take long to type things out properly, even for someone who's not an experienced typist, so why don't you do it?? Not only is it annoying to people like me, but it makes you come across as thick in my opinion. The people I know that do it are generally put under the label of 'scally' but some of the people really aren't like that at all, the way they type just makes them seem that way... So please, if you fall into the category of shameless txt speaker, try and do something about it, not just for my sake, but for your own.

        The adverts for it keep coming on and I don't watch much TV, but  urlLink NY-LON  certainly seems like it might be worth a look. I read the feature in The Sun TV Guide aswell and I'm liking the sound of it. It's a love story about two people who meet, but are from different sides of the world. Long distance relationships eh... "If you feel you can't be with anyone else, you  make  it work." commented the female lead... Sounds familiar... Anyway, I at least recognised 2 of the actors; Sooz from As If and the bloke from Teachers. So tomorrow night at 10, Channel 4, I think I'll see if its worth my while...    The  urlLink Olympics  is becoming slightly boring now, what with it just being the track and field events. I personally enjoyed the swimming, and more unusual-type sports. Table tennis. Wow, now that's a game :p I am impressed by that grey-haired bloke though... Jonathan Edwards. Have you seen that guy jump? It's a shame he's retired. He was a great athlete... Just like our very own Paula Radcliffe.   Although I despise running (unlike Gordy...) I really feel for her. In all the interviews I've seen she's broken down in tears. I guess she feels she's let the whole country down :( I don't think she has though. She's still the world record holder and a woman of remarkable endurance who I really admire.  Well my musical listening has stepped down a notch from  urlLink LaunchCast  radio, to the video station they have, as my skips have run out :( Well I guess I could listen to my CDs... It would make sense :p Although I like the randomness that Launch offers. It's changed from  urlLink Linkin Park  - Breaking the Habit to  urlLink The Vines  - Ride. Two pretty good songs. Although I'm sure Gordy wouldn't agree with the first one, even though he's never heard it *rollseyes* :p Keaton Simons now... Who? *skips* ah  urlLink Nickelback  - Figured you out. That's a good song.  Anyway enough about music... I'm really starting to like this blogging malarky and getting the hang of it too :D I might even write again tonight... But we'll see about that.

      Well here we are, a blog, by me! I'd guess that not  that  many people will read this, but I guess it's partly for my own benefit so I can talk crap without too much criticism. Well I'm currently listening to  urlLink Muse  : Time is running out. A pretty good song 'cos its fairly original in terms of todays music. I've not really done much today... Got up to talk to Gordy, slept some more then got up to make myself a lovely lunch of burger and noodles. mmmmm. Then i decided it was time to face the naked zombies on  urlLink RE0  and managed to pwn them good! Oooo and I did myself a french manicure which I'm quite proud of. Even if I do say so myself.  Anyway, on this fine day I have a topic I wish to talk about. Romance. Good news guys, it really isn't dead. 2 members of the male population have restored my faith (not to mention Gordy but that goes without saying) But one picked a lovely piece of jewellery for his girl *jealous* and the other organised a surprise for his girlfriend consisting of roses and candles. awwwwww.  Well that's me done for today. I'm sure I'll write again soon though. This really is a good idea...
