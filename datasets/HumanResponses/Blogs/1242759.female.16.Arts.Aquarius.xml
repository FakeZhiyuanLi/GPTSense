      under water pressure, the colors flee escaping swirling together as one flooding the sink a flash of light and color and down the drain they swirl

      Pretty Girl (The Way) was a song I discovered a year or two ago, its quite good, at least worth listening to.&nbsp; A nice love song, but little edgy. &nbsp; Yeah, well I was reminded of this when I heard their new song Memory on the launch cast radio. &nbsp; Memory bringing back memories. &nbsp; Sorry for posting allllll the songs I find that I like.&nbsp; But I think it is worth it, we can realize each others tastes and such.

      Almost over by Limp Bizkit, not my favorite band but the verses are cool. &nbsp; Blue eyes look you over, with a turquoise rim they stare, accusing, a darkness oozes out and over, surrounding you over your head the chill of the glare as icicles form in your mind you are lower than an ant and those never blinking eyes will never leave.  &nbsp;  Peacock Feathers

      I just got ahold of Dookie, which is an old school Green Day Albumn.  I say if we become anything, we shoudl do a cover albumn, and beat the shit out of Jessica Simpson for butchering Angel, which was a beautiful song, before she killed it trying to use her voice in a way she does not have enough power for.  Sorry you aren't Christina.   can you tell it bothers me?  "Save us from the wicked, shield our souls..."

      Float on is some trippy shit, oh my spinning sheep.  No Sapphire lets not think about what they are doing to the sheep.  And in the silence of the night one might find peace and satisfaction where all other elements have gone to ground the intensity of the silence overpowers simple creatures, simple thoughts and simple dreams Particles of dark emerge, contrasting and confusing the senses, spice in the wind brought to the tiger
