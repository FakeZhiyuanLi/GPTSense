      I am nervous now.  I just woke up from a nap.  I realized that the Love of my Life probably has no interest in me at all.  I cannot handle this.  I wish I could just ask him straight out but if he did have interest in me I think that would be a bad move.  I really like him so I don't want to do ANYTHING wrong.  Naturally my stomach knew all of this before I did and did flips for hours before it would tell me what was wrong.  It sent out this horrible emotion that seems to be a mix of panic and disappointment.    I don't WANT him to have no interest in me.  I think I've started to beg.  I don't know who I am begging but it's pitiful.  I want him to like me.

      Ok, ok.  I have good news for a change.    I've been talking to this other boy.  He is so great.  He has this wonderful sense of humor.  He is gorgeous.  He is so sweet and everything.  Last night he came over and met my mother and stuff.  Being a minor is just  lovely  [sarcasm, if you could not tell].  But everything went so well that I can't help but be so grateful for every event that led up to the wonderful night that was last.  I'm full of happiness.  Little giggles and this funny little expression that I can't get off of my face are in a way haunting me.  I WOKE UP smiling.  It was odd.  And it reminded me that the Love of my Life was over last night and I thought about him for hours and about the hurdles that I might have to go through and how I am WILLING to go through them, whatever they are because he is so great and I could be with him for the rest of my life.  And if you knew me a year or even two months ago, you would know that I was firmly against anything like marriage.  This man... I feel that I could be with him without all of the security that I try to keep around me.  I could stay with him without ever having sex with him.  Just to be able to converse with him like I do now.  Just to be in each other's presence and ...    I'm really getting a bit ahead of myself.  I've never felt anything like this so I'm thinking that this must be the guy that I will be with forever. (You might have noticed.  Hehe)  And I do hope that I will be.  What I am saying is that maybe I'm not wise.  Maybe I am naive; A fool possibly.  But that doesn't matter.  I'll put it to the back of my mind and hope that everything will be ok.    Did I mention that he is brilliant on the guitar?

         Hello.  He really wants me.  I told him there is not a chance that we are ever going to have sex.  He doesn't seem completely turned off of the idea of talking to me, but it  is  taking longer than usual for him to answer my questions.  Maybe his toaster exploded or something.  I'll ask him...     ...No, he was just peeing.  You'll notice that I am still talking to him.  He  is  a really cool person.  And I can see that he may be trying to make me guilty in order to get "some".  But he may not be.  Either way, there is no need to be mean to the poor boy.  He's cool and he deserves the friendship that he says he will never deny  me  of.  He is cool.  I like cool people.  And he isn't cool in a bad way as some teenagers would define it.  He is good with come backs.  And he is good with computers.  He is funny and I can have good conversations with him.  I don't like him "that" way, however.       It's such a compliment, this desire of his.  I don't care if he is one of those guys that will "do" anything that stands upright and has a vagina.  I will take it as a compliment and stop talking about it because there are other things in life.     In my real life, this isn't big deal.  It's just that it is in the back of my mind and I needed some release.  My huge dilemma today was that I just put my teddy bear through the laundry.  I was scared for his "life."  Now I can breath.  He is clean and will be there tonight.       I made pizza for dinner last night.  Four pizzas.  "People" think that making pizza is making one round pizza or making several English muffins with spaghetti sauce and American cheese.  No, I made four cookie sheet shaped pizzas.  They were good.  I love feta.  I love garlic.  The family likes other stuff and I didn't have that kind of pizza with them.       I have to finish recording my music.  I am not sure that I will ever get it done.  I give myself a week.  I need Jenny to be quiet again.  I need to practice a bit more so I can hit those notes perfectly.  We just got another bird too.  ::sigh::  It'll be okay.  I will go on.  I will be happy.  I will finish the pile of books beside my bed without library fines.  All that good stuff.

         Hello.  I am such a wimp.  And a sucker and any other word that explains that I can't say, "No."  You know that guy in the last entry?  Yeah.  Mmmhmm.  I keep talking to him and I met him and now . . . he likes me.  ::sigh::  Now I need to tell him, "No, I will never have sex with you, " and it will be all finished and he won't nag me anymore or offer me alcohol.  He is really awesome but an old friend of mine explained to me the ladder theory.    http://www.intellectualwhores.com/masterladder.html     Boys and girls can't be friends without the boy wanting to have sex with the girl.  I denied it.  I tried really hard.  Only one guy doesn't even hint at it, but he doesn't hint at much of a friendship either so I can't count him.  You know?  I'm losing hope.     This guy is really cool, but I don't want to have sex with people right now.  And he is so obviously going for it.  He says he is persistent.  And he is very good with computers and is probably reading this as I type!  ::darts eyes around and looks for suspicious cloud shaped icons on desktop::  Well, maybe he isn't but you know how it is.       And just because someone craves sex doesn't mean they are going to have sex.  Cravings for food are normal for dieters but we won't even go there.  And if you ask direct questions I will answer them, but if you only ask select questions you might get the wrong idea.  Sorry to all of those who are reading these random thoughts. . .

           Good Morning.  Despite the loud screeches currently coming from my bird and contradicting my point, I think this day will be more peaceful than the others.  I don't feel the stress of that phone call from the man I don't want to talk to.  I know I have to finish off things, but I know I won't make myself feel so miserable as he is making himself.  Why does he feel the need to wallow in the feeling of "the end"?        I don't feel much but passion to its full extent.  If this were a perfect world I might feel happiness to it's full extent, but I'm to afraid I'll smile like a . . . freak for lack of a better word.  Do you know the feeling?  Do you know when you're making a facial expression that must look odd or offensive, but you cannot get it off your face?  You look stranger trying to remove it than you did in the first place.  Nevermind strange expressions, ones of happiness have become sinful.  The seemingly constant murmur of "I HATE SOMEONE WHO SMILES ALL THE TIME!!!" in the wind is like the word "slut" in a way.  And if you care about your social status at all you don't want to be one.  At least you don't want to be known as one.        I smile too often, but I'm not smiling as if I am as happy as I usually am.  I've had people question me about the smirk on my face as I am, let's say, peeling potatoes.  "What's so wonderful about peeling potatoes that is making you smile so much?" they might ask.  Being me, and I am me, I probably would reply, "It's a sick thing really.  What's so wonderful about scraping off the skin of a living thing with this sharp but dull tool?"  Why I Was Smiling would slip my mind, and I'd be stuck on the cruelty of my task.     Lesson- Don't Point out my Smile.          No, you may point out my smile, but don't expect me to tell you why it is really there.  It's usually something, you know, inappropriate, so irrelevant that it would take a few days to trace back to the though that got me there, or fascinating to me and only me to such an extent that your brain would ache for a day trying to figure out (a) "Why the hell is she thinking of that?" (b) "Why is it making her smile?" & (c) "Why you are telling  me  even though I asked you?  It has nothing to do with me."        Trust me.  I know.  It's happened enough times for me to be an undesignated expert on the subject.  But anyway, we were getting to why my day is going to be more peaceful than the past few (despite my bird Sybil's screeching and whistling and talking loudly).  For some reason it was searched on the internet a subject that applied to me.  This doesn't happen very often.  But an Instant Message was sent and the fact that I am sixteen years old didn't bother this man.  And he is only twenty-three himself so it didn't bother me.  We got to talking and all that good stuff and now he won't leave me alone.  I made him take a night without talking to me because if anything is going to make him see how ridiculous he sounds it's sleep.  I think that the worst thing the girl in that Meatloaf song could do was tell him he can't sleep on it.  I understand though.  It's all about the moment.         In the moment . . .        I am a wonderful, beautiful, completely desirable person in the moment.  ::smiles and nods as if she is . . . for lack of better wording (again!) . . . the bomb.  I mean, I must be if more than one person can make all of this commotion.  Maybe I led him on or something?  I have to wonder these things.  After the situation happens it is my nature to analyze it and not get anywhere because the one place where I do  not  see outside of the box is  The World of Tammy .        My family has a "curse" too.  I couldn't understand why it would be a curse at the time.  When you're as young as I was, breastless, female and not getting any numbers you think that the curse would be quite nice.  I know better now.  ::Smirks and raises eyebrows as she reflects::      I really  have  gotten proposed to many times.  On my deathbed I should make a tally.  It would be cool.         Anyway, I don't want to talk to him anymore.  I usually hold on to the friendship but this one will not be worth it.  And I'm going to be leaving the state anyway.  Why do you think I haven't been dating?  Oh yeah, this is my third post.  I have to turn "bitch" for a bit.  I hate doing that.  It's not what I am used to.  I am just fine with getting walked on most of the time.  This is a stranger, however.  And he has a penis so I cannot cut him any slack.  I have had too much experience to deny that fact.  This might be a good time to mention that I am reading  Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time  by Michael Shermer.  It's helping me question my preconceived notions.  I pulled an article out of Redbook this month and that's my book mark.  Question your beliefs and assumptions!  It's good for you unless you need the stability.  Most likely you won't even think that it is a belief if it is akin to your stability.  It's a fact!  ::smirks::        Good-bye and thank you for listening.

      I wanted "someone" to come over last night and be here with me in my boredom.  What better to do when bored than make out?  Instead I talked on the phone with a guy I met through an IM.  I don't want to  meet people right now but I can't help but want to meet cool people.  And I don't want to lose the cool person becaue I don't feel like talking this month.  I'm busy recording and trying to figure out what I'm doing.  And I'm really tired right now.  I'm too tired to finish this post.

           I love to blog, but it has gotten more and more difficult over the years.  Friends and friends' friends become bloggers and I have to share with the whole world, my world, instead of the few who happened upon the site one day.  Never mind the struggle to keep up with them.  I liked it back when I was not doing this for the social life (if you'd call it that).  This might be a wonderful thing.

      I've been breathing much more lately.  I think it will all be ok, whatever happens in life.    I really like that boy but it will not be the end if he doesn't like me in return.  I will be disappointed, but there are worse things.    I went shopping today with Jenny and Jaime.  There were a couple of gift certificates just sitting in my wallet from Christmas time.  I got some pencils, an Evanescence CD and the glasses with the nose and mustache attached.  Awesome, huh?  It was very fun and it was a successful shopping day, though I did not buy the beautiful garter belt that I  so  wanted.    I just ate a bowl of ice cream.    Really, what can be better?  I am leaving for a wonderful place in two days.  Tomorrow I spend the day with my sisters.  I think life is good.  Very good, indeed.
