      It all began back in 1979. Well, for me, at least.  Television was quite different back then. We didn't have 780 channels. Shows that people snicker at today like CHiP's and Diff'rent Strokes were actually popular. And we had these things called game shows.  Yeah, I know, they're still around. But not like today. It wasn't Who Wants To Be A Millionaire in 35 minutes, and who can screw over their oppoents worse to win.  Not only that, but they were everywhere. They dominated daytime television the way shock value talk shows do today.  I fell in love with them at the age of four. And while I'd watch pretty much any game show back then as passionately as I'd watch any&nbsp;baseball game in the 1980's, I had my favorites: The Price Is Right. The Joker's Wild. Family Feud. Match Game.  And Tic Tac Dough.  I was five during what I call The Summer Of Thom. A young Naval lieutanant named Thom McKee would become a contestant on Tic Tac Dough in 1980, and would win.  And win.  And win.  And WIN.  When his reign of terror was finally ended by Eric Krapelien two months later, Thom would walk away holding nearly every record in the book.  $312,700 in cash in prizes, including 8 cars.  46 consecutive appearances.  43 wins.  88 games (the 43 wins, 44 ties and the loss to Krapelien).  During that summer, the second biggest question in the minds of television viewers was "When will Thom McKee lose?", eclipsed by only three words that dominated pop culture that summer: Who shot JR?  In the twenty four years since Thom's incredible run, we've had our share of unique and amazing contestants.  Michael Larson, the man who would memorize the pattern to Press Your Luck's big board and take home $110,237 in a single day.  John Carpenter, the man who gave "the final answer heard all around the world" and became the first million dollar winner on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.  Kevin Olmstead, who won a record $2,180,000 on Millionaire.  Ed Toutant, the contesant who was brought back after an erronous question and would $1,860,000 on Millionaire.  Dan Avila, who would TWICE miss questions that would've earned him more than $1 million (the first for $2.2 million) on Greed.  Thom's record for winnings would stand for nineteen of those years, until the birth of the million dollar game shows. But two of his records still stand to this day: 43 wins, 46 consecutive appearances.  In my mind, those have always been the big ones. While these big money winners on these big money shows are impressive, could they have won night after night for two months?   Since 1980, only one other contestant would come anywhere near Thom's 43 wins: Kit Salisbury would win 36 games on Tic Tac Dough in 1984.  First off, you look at the pressure and focus it would take to repeat Thom's streak. Add&nbsp;in&nbsp;the decline of game shows (being replaced more and more by reality junk like Survivor and freak shows like Fear Factor),&nbsp; and the fact the game shows of recent years weren't designed to allow a McKee-esque run (Jeopardy!'s old five wins and retired rule, games like TPIR not having returning contestants at all), and it truly began to appear Thom's record would never fall.   I've always viewed 43 the way baseball fans view 56 - and like DiMaggio's hitting streak, it was an untouchable record.  We'll move forward to last summer.  After nineteen years, Jeopardy! would change the rules. No longer would a contestant be retired after five wins. "The sky's the limit" - they would be able to return until they lost.  When the change was announced, I was all for it. I've missed the days of a contestant like McKee or Salisbury or Wilbur Hicks (another great TTD champion) sticking around and becoming a familiar face. Yet, at the same time, I still thought Thom's record was quite safe - there was no way someone could come along and win on Jeopardy! for two straight months. The game is too difficult. There's too much pressure. Thom would talk about the focus it took to win those 43 games and I'd think "It's got to take about 100 times more to pull it off on Jeopardy!."  I thought "We'll get a few players who could win ten straight. Maybe someone will get close to fifteen."  June 2, 2004 (ironically, a very unpleasant anniversary in my life), Jerry Harvey would make his third appearance on Jeopardy!, having won $70,0002 the first two nights. His opponents were a fundraiser from New York named Julia Lazarus... And a software engineer from Utah named Ken Jennings.  Ken would win $37,201. He'd then defeat Carrie Youngblood and Chad Kaihe the next night.  Then win his third straight game. Then his fourth. Then his fifth.  Then his tenth.  Then his fifteen.  At this point, I begin having conflicting thoughts... On one hand, he looks nearly unbeatable. On the other hand, he's still twenty eight wins from the record, and... We're talking about Jeopardy!! Not a chance.  Twenty.  Twenty-five.   THIRTY  - not only becoming the third player to EVER win thirty or more games, but passing $1,000,000 in winnings.  Now, I'm not thinking "No way", but "Oh my god, he has a chance!"   Thirty five  - now he's only EIGHT from the record!  And now he's at thirty eight - and shattered the single-day record in that victory!  Now, as we sit and wait until Labor Day, he sits just five wins away from a record I thought was untouchable. He's become such a huge story that he was the headline on ESPN.com yesterday. He's been on talk shows. He's perhaps received more attention than Thom McKee did in 1980 - thanks to the Internet and hundreds of TV channels.  What a ride it has been - and it's not over yet. I'm counting the days until the temperatures cool down, and the calendar says September, and sports fan begin thinking about football and the World Series..... And seeing if Ken Jennings can take those last few steps toward breaking the most amazing record in game show history.  It's been one amazing summer, here's hoping for more of the same this fall.

      A friend of mine had brought up some concerns on when we'd see Ken in season 21. He had thought the season might start off with some sort of tournament. However, after checking  urlLink Jeoparchive!  (which I've added to the links), season 20 started with two weeks of normal games on September 8, followed by "Back To School Week" on the 22nd, then back to normal on the 29th. So, if season 21 follows the same pattern, then we should indeed be seeing Ken back on the 6th, as planned.  Should there be a change in plan, I'll update the dates to the right if/when I hear anything.   urlLink Jeoparchive!  is a site that features complete results of all games from last season - the answers and questions to all 61 answers on each show, the contestants, the scores, and the total winnings of returning champions. So, if anyone out there is curious to see how Ken did on June 23 or July 7, you can pull up the results there.

      Top Ten Ways To Irritate Alex Trebek presented by "Jeopardy" Champion Ken Jennings  10. "Ask him on air, 'So who did your Botox?'" 9. "Instead of responding, get his attention by throwing nickels at his head" 8. "Buzz in without using your hands" 7. "Give Courtney Love directions to his house" 6. "Whenever he says the word 'potpourri,' you mumble, 'Woman'" 5. "Tell him he's no Wink Martindale" 4. "Remind him that although he's a naturalized citizen, he'll always be a product of the evil Canadian empire" 3. "Complain that he's not nearly as Trebek-y in person" 2. "Your only response: 'Who gives a rat's ass?'" 1. "Insist on buying a vowel"

      Last week, Steve Beverly posted a  urlLink column  on Ken Jennings and his naysayers on his  urlLink website . I think he does a great job of debunking all of those who assume that Ken must be a cheater or "the fix is in", because people can't believe he's done this.  Sure, what Ken has done is unbelievable, but it's happening, and there is no reason to believe cheating is taking place. The guy is smart, he's mastered the timing on his buzzer, and if you've watched in recent weeks, you'll see more and more contestants with "deer in the headlights" looks once they realize how many games Ken has won (and you can bet they'll be even more of them next season, since his potential opponents would've had the chance to see at least part of the streak on TV already).  I'd like to go a bit further with this, though.  I do believe a big part of the reason some people don't take Ken seriously is the growing mentality in America that intelligence is a handicap. Anyone with intelligence anymore is labeled a "dork", a "nerd" or a "geek" and basically laughed at. That's the kind of childish nonsense you expect to see in junior high school. Yet, you'd be amazed how many adults I've heard say these things in the last couple of months. "What a dork." "He sure must not have had much of a social life."  Don't get me wrong. I'm not irked because I am a fan of Jennings and these people aren't. I'm irked at their reasons for not liking him. Nobody says they have to like him, just as I don't have to like Michael jordon. I'm annoyed over the ignorance and junior high immaturity I see from  adults . This nonsense of having a "happening" social life and paying more attention to cliques than having a mind should be gone well before turning 18.  That being said, they're welcome to think what they want. After all, he's a "dork" with $1.3 million. Or maybe  that  is what ticks them off. Could it be the ol' green eyed monster?  I'm rarely one to accuse people of jealousy. Lord knows I've heard it enough over the years (ie. I'm supposedly "jealous" of the 49ers because the Rams only have one Super Bowl). But I think it could apply with some people in this case.  Furthermore, it never ceases to amaze me to see the double-standard that exists between sports and anything that requires a brain. By this I mean the growing number of people who are "sick" of seeing him win game after game. Were the majority of people complaining that "We're sick of Tiger!" when Tiger Woods was winning major after major? Would these people by griping if jordon came out of retirement and was about to break Kareem's record for career points? How many people ooh and aah everytime Barry Bonds hits a home run - despite the growing evidence suggesting Bonds has indeed  cheated  his way to the "top"?  If Ken Jennings were a pro athlete on the verge of a record, do you think they'd be so much griping? Probably not. This is just another example of how people are ridiculed for being intelligent. And that is what's sickening about this - not that people dislike Ken, but that a growing majority of society seems to be stuck with a junior high mentality/maturity level.  Give the guy some credit. Even as much as I despise jordon, I admit the guy had talent. My problem with him was how he used his talent (playing for himself instead of his team). To suggest Jennings is some cheater or part of a fix is nuts. I don't think he's willing to serve prison time, nor do I think a number of people involved with Sony/Jeopardy! are, either. And instead of childish comments like "dork", or acting like being stupid is cool, wake up and realize what you could do in life if you used your brain. No, not everyone can become a millionaire on a game show like Ken has, but not too many people make a living with bad grades and a "cool" social life.  Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life. Eric Cartman and Beavis are amusing cartoon characters, but going through life being as dumb as them won't get you far.
