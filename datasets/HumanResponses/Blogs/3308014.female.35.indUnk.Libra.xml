      I hope the lackluster buildup doesn't cause this post to be a disappointment.  Many years ago the 3 surgical hospitals/campuses in my city were overhauled by some team of somebodies.  The somebodies decided there was no need for services to be duplicated at sites as this caused a need for 2 (or 3) sets of staff and equipment to be supplied.  They came up with a game plan of which site would absorb some services, and give up other services, and then they came up with a time line (milestones) of when all the changes would take place.  Since then, building and renovation have been taking place, and they are finally beginning to switch around services.  My hospital is going to become an ambulatory centre, focusing on cataract/eye surgery, urology surgery, and hand and upper limb surgery, with small contingents of general, gyn, ent and ortho thrown in for good measure.  When the teams/powers that be looked at what was transferring, they took into account the amount of work that was being sent, the number of people hours it would take to make that work amount function, and then they broke it down into specific job lines (ie. 8 full time RNs, 2 part time RNs, 1 Attendant, etc).  When a program transfers, those job lines have the "opportunity" to transfer with the program, since many nurses and other health care workers have specialized in that program over the years, and may not wish to stay in a hospital which will no longer be providing care in their area of expertise.  In November I was told that an attendant with the ophthalmology program wanted to transfer to my site, and he had more seniority than I.  Despite working in the OR for 17 years, I was the least senior in my department, so I was becoming "redundant".  They outlined all my options, but I wasn't given official notice because the transfer date had been pushed back.  According to Union contract, they had to give me 4 months notice (and only 4 months) and they were not going to give me one day more.  I looked at my options.  1. Accept a buy out package, return to school, and get reimbursed up to $5000 for any tuition paid out in the first year.  This left me with a lump sum (which would prevent me from collecting unemployment until it ran out), and the knowledge that unemployment would only let me attend school for 1 year, if it lead to a job within one year.  Therefore, university was out, and any college program more than 1 year long was out.  2. Exercise my bumping rights and move to the job of the least senior full time person in my job category.  I spoke to several people familiar with work in the unit that person was in, and knew I would hate switching to that job.  3. Apply for any job postings which came up in the meantime, and get one of those.  I went to a few unemployment workshops, to learn about the aide available from them.  I spoke to college and university counselors, and I seriously considered becoming a pharmacy technician, while attending a private medical school and retaining part-time employment, therefore keeping my seniority.  I would have to pay for the schooling myself, but the job would be in my current union, so I would have 17 years seniority in applying for any pharm tech jobs in the hospital, and therefore job security.  I went to the private school, and they had me take a multiple choice aptitude test before the interview.  The interviewer then did his job too well.  He told me I had the best score he had ever seen, and he raved over my transcript marks.  Shortly thereafter I was conversing with a co-worker who was just about finished her BA of Ed, after returning to school in her early 40's.  When I was younger I wanted to be a teacher, but I got sidetracked.  My conversation with her, my circumstances, and the interviewers remarks all led me to decide I was going to go to university and become a teacher.  Surprisingly, my husband agreed.  He was more supportive of my longer and more expensive schooling than he was of my short-term pharm tech program.  I applied for a part-time job in the Central Processing department, and 1 week before the deadline the hospital had in which to give me notice, they called and said I was the successful applicant.  I accepted, and so my other options never came to pass.  Now I am set on a very exciting course, but I'm very frustrated that the university has not yet accepted me!  Grrrrrrrr  And that was my restructuring story  Cheers Jay-A

      You're still not getting the "restructuring" story, because I need to vent.  I applied for University in March.  I can check the website with my own "special and private" id to see the status of my application.  The site says they received it at the end of March, and that it should take 2-4 weeks before they offer me admission (or say neener neener, NO!)  I just spent over 20 minutes waiting for "the next available operator", and He Said:  "We received it in the beginning of April, it was processed by April 14th, in 2 days it will be 4 weeks" (No, in 2 days it will be 1 month, today is 4 weeks, kid), and "it's a really busy time of year."  They may have it processed within another 2 weeks.  GRRRRRRRRR  I changed my life for this opportunity, and the University counseller that I went to see (twice) told me  "Historically, we have never turned down a qualified mature applicant for part-time studies, and Jay-A",  , "you are a qualified mature applicant for part-time studies."  So basically, she gave me the best assurance she could without getting her butt into a legal bind if by some chance I didn't make it.  I know that MOST LIKELY I'll be accepted, but I don't like most likely, I want I AM ACCEPTED.  Grrrrrrrr, Arrrrrrrrg  Out of all the choices I was given regarding my restructuring out of my job, I took the reins of control and MADE this choice an option, and threw all my other options out the window when I did so.  If I don't get accepted to University  a)  I'll be hugely embarressed, because everyone thinks I'm going  (over 100 nurses, surgeons and anaesthetists in my current department, plus other hospital employees, my husband's family, my family, etc, etc)  b)  I'm stuck taking the part-time job I begin at the end of this month.  Sure I get full-time training for the summer, and sure they are short staffed and I can probably work full-time hours even past that, but I don't care!  I want to be a student.  Grrrrrrrrr, Arrrrrrrrrg, Growl!  I'm still not completely vented, but I don't know what else to say, and it is time to head out of town to my second session of the course I need to take for my new job.  sigh  Jay-A

      It's evening, the kids are in bed, the hubby is (finally) on his way home from work, and I was clicking links in my profile to see who is out there in Blog Land.  On one lady's blog (she wasn't memorable) I found JEREMY  http://www.whoisthatwithjeremy.com/  At the moment, only one page of photos is accessible, but I've emailed Jeremy's dad about the problem, so I'm sure that will be fixed soon.  If you are a parent, and you like silly harmless things that take a bit of imagination, insanity, and hutzpah (dunno if I spelled that right), then you will like the site that Jeremy had his dad create.  I'm off to do stuff, but I'm sure I'll get to that "restructuring/career change" story that I promised ... tomorrow.  Not that anyone is actually reading this.  Perhaps I'll tell my friends and family about it, but I think not.  They hear me yap all the time, so why inflict them with the pressure to read my less than stellar thoughts?  Cheers!

      I don't have much time for this initial post, but I feel a need to write something in order to complete the creation process.  I'm thrilled about heading to University in the fall, and in order to implement this opportunity, I have applied for and taken a new job within the hospital that I work at, and I begin this new job on the last day of May.  I've spent the last 17 years working as an OR Attendant (muscular nurse's aide with only on the job training - no courses), and I shall now be seeing things a bit differently as I wash, package and sterilize the surgical and respiratory equipment used throughout the hospital.  Fortunately, the OR and the Central Processing departments work very closely together, so I know the majority of my new co-workers, and I'll still see my old co-workers daily.  My next post shall concern the reasons (city-wide hospital restructuring) that have led to my life-altering choices.  Cheers! Jay-A
