      There's a boat, I could sail away There's the sky, I could catch a plane There's a train, there's the tracks I could leave and I could choose to not come back Oh never come back  There you are, giving up the fight Here I am begging you to try Talk to me, let me in But you just put your wall back up again Oh when's it gonna end  (Chorus:) How far do I have to go to make you understand I wanna make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are So I'm gonna walk away And it's up to you to say how far  There's a chance I could change my mind But I won't, not till you decide What you want, what you need Do you even care if I stay or leave Oh, what's it gonna be  (Chorus)  Out of this chair, or just across the room Halfway down the block or halfway to the moon  How far do I have to go to make you understand I wanna make this work so much it hurts, but I just can't Keep on giving, go on living with the way things are So I'm gonna walk away And it's up to you to say Yeah I'm gonna walk away And it's up to you to say how far      haha..that song is in my head..How Far by Martina McBride! i love that song! but yea..wow..i'm so tired! i was just sun tanning the whole day and then rode my bike up to Blimpie's w/ Hannah!!

      I wonder where your heart is 'Cause it sure don't feel like it's here Sometimes I think you wish That I would just disappear Have I got it all wrong Have you felt this way long Are you already gone  Do you feel lonely When you're here by my side Does the sound of freedom Echo in your mind Do you wish you were by yourself Or that I was someone else Anyone else  Where would you be If you weren't here with me Where would you go If you were single and free Who would you love Would it be me Where would you be  I don't wanna hold you back No I don't wanna slow you down I don't wanna make you feel Like you are tied up and bound 'Cause that's not what love's about If there's no chance we can work it out Tell me now Oh, tell me tell me now  Repeat Chorus  Have I become the enemy Is it hard to be yourself     sad sad song and i liek it alot! i guess i can relate to it!! but ya..i havent had the greatest day today! it actually sucked! but yea..i did good in softball..we beat the other team 12-0! it was fun!! haha..but i'm gonna go bye bye                    melissa

        hey    omg i havent written in a long time and a lot has happened! Well firstly monday was a fun day!! I went to the pool at state farm w/ Aj, nic, and dani! We went putt putt and went swimming! It is fun going swimming with them..but aj kept trying to dunk me which was very mean of him!!!! lol... and then we went home after swimming for a while and he ate dinner at our house before my softball game that nite!! SO yea...i was walkn outside to put a towel on a chair and there are steps going out onto the patio and i totally miss the 2nd step and fall right on my ankle really really really bad!! and i started screaming really loud!! Aj was the only one who saw me fall and everything and he came running out and so did my mom..and it hurt liek a mother! so bad!! and then after me screaming and in pain for a lil bit i finally got up from off the ground and my mom helped me back into the house..and aj was playing docter with me and helped me get ice and a towel and put ice on my ankle and made me feel a lot better!! thank you aj!! i really liked that!! and then i still wanted to go to softball that nite with my ankle in pain but o well..so i went and played on it..even though it hurt really bad!! ow! and then we went to dairy queen afterwards and it was good and drove aj home! i went home and looked at my ankle and it was huge! it was swollen alot!! and it still hurt bad so i had to elevate it and ice it some more..then my mom asked if i wanted to go to the er and stuff even though it was like already 10 at nite! i wanted to but didnt want to make her go out to it! so i said no and we went in the morning! and i found out that its just a sprain and so i have to wear this air cast thingy! and i found out a good thing!! I had to take x-rays and the doctor said my growth plates r just starting to close so he said that i might still grow a couple more inches! omg i was soo soo happy! i'm 2 short and need to grow!! haha but yea..then i went to aj's baseball game that nite too...and went to marching band with him after that..i'm such a supportive g/f...he owes me for that!!      Then yesterday i went to beths pool and aj went too..it was me aj beth lindsey kalyn, and tyler showed up... it was fun.. i liked it...aj just tryed to dunk me and put my head underwater again! er i dont liek when he does that! haha..some stuff got a lil rough at the end of the party w/ me n him..but i wont mention any details..he knows hopefully how i felt and everything..      Today dani came over for a lil and we played w/ the ouigi board! omg fun! haha..it said some stuff bout me n aj and her n nic!! and other things but i dont think she would want me to say! haha...but yea..i have had a boring day..aj is at a baseball game but i cant go and then hes going somewhere after that..its gonna b a boring nite..no one to talk to!! but yea..wow ...long blog..and whoever reads this must have a lot of time on their hands! lol..and please leave comments for me! so i can read them! but yea..well i will go!! thanx for reading this if ya did! its my interesting life...haha..bye bye for now!

      Lies I am going crazy Everything is so gray What happened to the perfect yesterday My heart is so broken Yet it is intact Will it ever mend when can I have my life back The sins of the human race They tear my world apart What was I thinking When I gave you my heart I feel all alone Even when you are by my side All of this Because you won’t swallow your pride As the sun sets I close my eyes I try to drift in to sleep But tears fill my eyes One day you will be true To us and to your heart But can we make it that long Or will it tear us apart?  i gave you my heart you broke it in two but i knew from the start i was meant for you so why arnt we together i dont understand i will love you forever just take my hand lets work this out and itl be ok i know without a doubt i need you today and forevermore i just want things to be like they were before...  Neva say I love uif it isn't really thereNeva talk bout feelingsif you really don't careNeva hold my handif u'r gonna break my heartNeva say u are gonnaIf u dont plan to startNeva look into my eyesIf all u do is lieNeva say helloIf u realy mean goodbyeIf u realy mean forevaThen please say ull try ..Never say forever..Because forever makes me cry..  You know, the worst part about having to fall asleep when you have a broken heart is having to wake up, because right when you start to open your eyes you are about to feel happy until you realize your life is terrible and the pain nearly swallows you whole..*  I loved you more than I have ever loved anyone. Why did you hurt me? You caused a lot of pain and you took a small piece of my heart with you. I try to forget you but something... something tells me not to. All I need, is to see you again... I need to know if it was real. I need you to look my in the eye and tell me that it wasn't.... But most of all... I need to see the look in your eyes when you say it. That will tell me all I need to know... and maybe then, I can get over you... or maybe, just maybe, I'll still let you keep that piece of my heart that you took away.      wow..my life kinda sucks rite now..i dont no how i feel..i'm in total shock! how could someone do this? i dont no wat else to say..i guess these poems kinda show how i feel rite now! heartbroken..i just need some1 and the some1 i need is the person who can't help me..                                                      :'(    Melissa-
