      well, i haven't wrote in 3 whole days, feels like an eternity don't it? how did you poor people get along without the devine daily story of my life? Well, i didn't have much to talk about, i actually don't think i did anything either of those days so you didn't miss much so heres the story of my day today since it was fun filled and exciting. i awoke and came down and got on my laptop as i usualy do, i talked for a while, nothing significant but it sustained my attention for a while. i played soccer today after brian woke up with him obviously and steve. it was good times, and incidently im getting good at pks. i can win contests almost every time so yay for me. after that i came back to my house and i had one of the most horifying food experiences ever. seriously. i was eating grapes and there was something on my finger so i looked down. it was a spider so flicked it off and looked at the grapes, there was spider nest in the grapes. I freaked out, oh man, i ran to the sink and gagged myself until i ralphed, twice. it wasn't cool.  I go to california on saturday, i know you'll miss me teribly and all but don't you cry, i'll be back in two weeks and then i'll come surfin back singin the beach boys with a tubular tan and a bodacious babe. good stuff eh? well uh, thats it, tell me if you want me to send you a california post card or anything of the sort.  love always, -alex

      haven't written in a while, sorry, i have a good one this time, sure to please the masses...or atleast alyssa and brian, you are the only masses who read this. Well, i played soccer agin yesterday it was happy times. I did pretty well actually, i didn't loose nearly as much as i thought i would.i started slow, took acouple easy shots and chipped some balls but progresed and got back into ripping shots. not as fast as i used to get them but hey, its the first time i've played in 6 weeks so im proud of myself. I also played alittle goal and while im out of condition and form, my reactions haven't dulled and i was able to save a few. i still have to train like mad because although i wasn't as bad as i thought i would be, i still need alot of work. After a wearing day of soccer, i went to punkinhead's aka brians house. it was good times aswell except i drank too much mountain dew and ate too much chocolate and we ended up staying up until 5 in the morning. kindof late yes but we slep till 2 this afternoon so needless to say we made up for it. It rained all day today so me and bri listened to blind melon and watched newly weds. sorta a dumb show but its ok. We then went to soccer premeire and looked at cleats. I tried some ouma kings on and realized I WANT THEM. trying them on made me see myself in those cleats even more. i want them SO bad its crazy. Tomorow me and bri have more soccer planed...well watching it anyway, U.S vs Granada world cup qualifying. cool doritos huh? Well, thats it for tonight, good night night. love always -alex

      yes, today was my first FULL day without a cast, my second REAL shower and tomorow i get to  PLAY SOCCER  tomorow. so yeah, good stuff, life is getting back to normal.  Well, im not bidding on any cleats, im not watching any games besides the ones i talked about last night, theres just not much to talk about in the soccer world, this is a first for me. uh, i get to play tomorow with brb also known as brian robert bouhl. so uh, yey for me. theres just not much to say other than the things that have been said, wow. nothing really new. maybe im just boring right now i don't know, i usualy have more to say. sorry for you who read this but i don't know what to say, maybe you should make something cool happen so i can write about...maybe. sorry and ofcourse love always -alex

      yup, today was the day. im cripple free. man it feels weird, my foot is like totaly alien to me. i look at it and im excited its back but with the mixture of it changing in the cast and not seeing it for ever, it doesn't even look like its a part of me. my foot and leg lost alot of muscle (yes you do have alot of muscle in your foot) and so they both look skinny and weird. also it is white and sort of harry and crusty and eww. see? alien foot. incidently, i took a shower and everything and it looks better than it did when i first got the cast off...plus it doesn't stink. it hurts still allittle but i think thats cause its just stiff.  well, i have good news and bad news in the world of alex's soccer, bad first. I didn't win my cleats, AGAIN. not cool i know but i think im just gonna get some when i get back from cali. incidently i bid on some indoors that i think are cool but brian doesn't. i don't care what he thinks, i like them. Alright, now to the good news...IM GOING TO THE  BAYERN MUNCHEN  and  MANCHESTER UTD  GAME. brian got tickets, they are in the nosebleeds ofcourse but hey, they were 40 bucks, the only good ones left were 150 so i think we did alright thank you very much. anyway, this is the chance of a lifetime, its gonna be great. Also im excited about a couplng of upcoming games in the very near future. This sunday is going to be a day to remember on the internation level...atleast for brian and i. the U.S./Granada game is on at 1 p.m. so GO U.S. (thats world cup quals...big stuff) and then at 2:45 p.m. (directly after the first game) its gonna be england vs. france...going to be a brilliant game. i think im for france though but im still undecided. anyway, that'll be big too. Well thats my life as it is right now, for those who do, thanks for reading, night night. love always -alex

      yeah, i get my cast off real soon now...in a couple hours. I'm so excited, it feels like christmas eve, seriously, thats how bad this thing was. it feels like i've been in prison for the last six weeks, even though i can walk on the cast, it still feels like a handicap. Also, it wasn't as bad anymore but now that im not really hurt anymore, it just feels big and doofy and anoying. anyway, for those who read this and enrich they're life by reading mine, im n=sorry i didn't post an entry yesterday, i didn't have much to write about and honestly i din't really feel like writing anything. incidently i think brian is the only one who reads these anyway, so i don't feel like i disapointed the masses or anything. Well, now on the the soccer stuff (you knew it was coming) i have some new cleats that im obsessed with on ebay, they are white puma kings. I nor any of my friends have had puma cleats before so im not sure if you are good, i hope they are, they look like it anyway. plus, i love my puma shoes, they are the most comfy shoes ever so hopefully the cleats will be the same. also, i found my dream cleats. they were champagne puma Ksl's size 10.5, my perfect size. sound perfect right? (not that you would know but they are, take my word for it) i want them so bad but there is a problem, i found them on the united kingdom ebay site and the seller told me upon contact that he will not ship to the u.s. its ok though, i can settle for the ones that i am going to order, i mean its not like these are exactly mediocre cleats anyway. Wish me luck this time, i guess i didn't have enough last time. i hope it works. Also, hannah wilkinson got her opperation on her wisdom teath, she seems to be in good shape though but everyone should tell her they love her. that always makes people feel good. Alright well thats it for tonight. love always -alex p.s. i think i found a way to fix the clock on the time posted thing, thank you brian

      you know how soo many times before, you've sen a penny laying on the floor or in he street unattended but you don't bother to pick it up. A penny? how insignificant, it barely matters. well, in my case, i matterd alot today. The cleats i've been telling you about, yeah, they ended today and i lost the auction by a penny at the last 2 minutes. 1 damn cent more or less determined my happyness for right now. its not meant to be? maybe but i don't really care right now. eve if i wasn't meant to have them, if i got them, i would have been happy and thats all there is to it. something doesn have to be matched up to you but if it makes you happy than you shouldn't care. whatever, i already wrote an entry earlier, i just wanted to write this one to blow off some steam by the way, the times are behind about 4 hours on the entrys, i don't know why. love always -alex

      yeah, well i got my grades. needless to say, no one was happy. i got 4 c's and i don't understand why. i thought i had 2 but i got c's in both of my art majors. i can't belive that, that makes me so mad cause unless i missed something, those were totaly undeserved. anyway, my parents didn't scream and ground me, they are doing the whole long term punishment thing. you know, like if we ever get in a fight or anything they'll use that as something to be mad about. Also i just asked for some new shoes and i was told that i wasn't really gonna get anything from them for a while. Yeah, that sucks cause i was banking on getting some new gloves and a new goalie jersey from them for manual season and now im not too sure.  Anyway, now to the happy stuff, im gonna get my cast off on wednesday morning so ofcourse im gonna play soccer that day. if you are one of my soccer friends, were gonna play, my schedul is gonna be full of soccer. im gonna have to train SOOO hard if i want to make manual. i have 4 weeks. so im even gonna be training when im in california. Incidently i have 8 hours left on the cleats auction and im still winning although some dude kept trying to outbid me and jacked my price up to 45 dollars but its ok, im still getting 140$ cleats for real cheap. I also learned kelme leather conditioner comes with it which i have been wanting, i need to condition my predators. well ok, thats my life thus far, not much else to say. love always -alex

      Im sorta sad right now, Alyssa can't come over like i have had planed for a while so im left with nothing to do. thats not cool. Also, REPORT CARDS come out today. i haven't gotten my mail yet but im scared. i know its not too bad, i mean i didn't get any d's or u's or anything but i think i have two c's. I know thats sorta weak to be scared about but i honestly don't know how my parents will react.  Any way, no ones bid on the cleats still which is real cool. they only have a day and 8 hours left so i could win them. that would be good. Incidently with the whole soccer thing...my teams last game today we lost 5-0. sortof tops off the season though considering we didn't diserve any more. for those who didn't know, my team wasn't very great and being captain and everything, i can honestly say my team we didn't deserve much so needless to say im trying out for a different team next year. the only set back is that because i haven't been able to play in so long because of the cast, im gonna be terrible. Also im gonna be in california durring united tryouts which means i have to get special tryouts. that sorta sucks. it sucks to play infront of someone alone cause they see every mistake you make. oh man. that means im gonna have to train SUPER hard for the next couple of weeks. so yeah. i think im done for today, i can't think of anything else to write. people don't read this anyway. love always -alex

      hello there, i've always wanted one of these  but always bee too lazy. it won't last long anyway cause usualy the people who have these just complian and for the most part i don't have too much to say thats out of the ordinary. anyway im lazy so i will just not write in it most of the time. well, i get my cast off soon which means i'll FINALY be cleared to play soccer, thats exciting. also im hopefully getting new cleats for the occasion, i bid on some on ebay but im not sure if i won or not, it ends in 2 days. incidently they are kelme master whites, the new versions, not like the one jon erickon has so they better not fall apart on me like hos did. im very excited.  Also U.S beat honuras 4-0 on wednesday, that was cool and they are curently 8th in the world. (if you don't know soccer, 8th in the world is amazing for us, i mean really, i don't consider us a soccer nation and think about how many countrys there are in the world) anyway, im proud of them. Euro 2004 is starting in about a week which is exciting cause its gonna be alot of international matches...GO HOLLAND...im a netherlands fan. im pissed that im gonna miss half the tournament but its a quality reason, being in california so im not going crazy about it or anything, i'll still get to see the final.  Yeah so most of the stuff in here is gonna be about soccer since as hannah wilkibean pointed out just today...im sortof a soccer dork. also, i don't have much drama in my life and im not manic depresive or anything so i don't have much else to talk about. After all of this, you may be wondering how the title of this entry relates to this whole thing, well, it does alot because there is only 4 days until i get my cast off. thats when i can play soccer again so yes, it actualy does relate very much to the rest of this. alright, well, with that explained, im very tired now and im thinking that bed is a good idea so that i don't end up falling asleep on the couch. night night. love always, -alex
