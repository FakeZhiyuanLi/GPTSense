      Alright...everyday this week I thought "dude, you've gotta update the site."  So here it is Friday: here's what happened this week-- Tuesday: Meet with career services lady; cry in office about potentially becoming unemployed.  Get great resources.  So currently, I'm in the process of trying to convince the State Department that I kick ass.   Wednesday: Cantor Practicuum.  Also known as "Why I don't Sing Early in the Morning."  I am the Psalmist for the Nov. 22 Mass of Christ the King.  Sweet, I know.  They have this thing where you go and practice with the organ in the basillica and get used to the acoustics.  In my case it involved my voice cracking like a 12 year old boy's and the director saying, "Well, you've got a month to work on it."  Thanks Andy.  I love the support.  You rock ... ... Not.  Wednesday night was also the big Halloween party which I will reserve for another post.   Thursday: Attend John Finnis' class on 4 hours of sleep.  Do not try this at home.  Cover for slacker friends who slept through the 8:30 class.  Gave them my notes.  Expecting massive payoff.  Meet with Father Coughlin who gives me a great book for the big paper and tells me how to get paid for the 7 hours of work I've put in on editting his article.  So beer money will soon be mine.   Friday: Happy Halloween.  I've got a black and orange book on my desk...is that halloween enough for you?

      And Fall Break has come to a close.  Today is the first day of the second half of the semester which means, I need to start learning evidence.  I also need to locate someone who would like to employ my rear end.  I picked up a book  Guerrilla Tactics for Getting the Legal Job of Your Dreams.   The first step: recognizing that money is not a factor.  Which is really easy to say when you don't have $100K stalking you like you're Britney Spears.  New thoughts over the weekend: "Money is not an object.  I'll work for a non-profit and be fufilled in every other way."  Right.  And live in a box in North East DC.  Thought #2: "I'll work for a firm to start, and then, if I don't like it, I'll move to another job."  Warmer.  But entails me  getting  a firm job to begin with.  Thought #3: "I'll buy  urlLink EWTN  and become a rainmaker, improving their television schedule, their budget, and their mission."  But that entails moving to Alabama.  Hmmmm. I like raccoons as much as the next person, but I think I'll pass.  Looks like it's back to the drawing board.  Again.

      So here I sit alone in my carrel.  The library has a grand total of four people in it.  This is great.  I have written 5 pages of my Catholic Social Thought paper.  I'm not sure what level of brilliance it rises to (if any) but at least it's started and, as we all know, staring down the evil, evil blank page is half the battle.  So feeling sufficiently started I decided to do some job search work.  I went to the "library" our Career Services Office is frequently encouraging us to visit.  And here's what I found,  a 1996 guide to litigation attorneys.  A guide to ND grads in the DC area that is at least four years old as one of our current professors is listed as a practicing attorney within it.  And a plethora of other  outdated  info for launching my career.  I know we all complain about CSO and how little they seem to do sometimes, usually because they refer us to this damned library.  Well if the library is full of out of date books, would someone   please   tell me how the hell I'm supposed to get a job?

      P.S.  Yes, Ms. Nebraska, I saw the painful ass-whooping that A&M recieved from the dubious Husker football team.  I have two things to say.   1. We'll get you next year...just wait till Francionne actually recruits some Aggies. 2. At least none of our football players beat up the opposition's fans.   Gig 'em Ags!

      My parents told me not to come home for fall break.  So here I sit on a lovely day in The Bend.  No, it's not like that....dad's working and mom's in school and the general consensus was that I could get more done if I stayed here.  And I'm happy to report that is nearly 2pm and I'm still sitting in my bathrobe and slippers: the portrait of absolute productivity.  That's okay, Ms. Nebraska and others are here so it's not like the Bend is completely devoid of fun.  We rented  The Two Towers  on friday while making signs for the Thomas More Society concession stand.  I finally understand why I'm such a nerd, and I have no idea why Ms. Nebraska did not throw something at me when every five minutes I would say something brilliant like, "Ohmigod, this is, like, the best scene of the movie."  Sadly, no drinking was involved in this travesty of coolness.  Although, as the final nail in my coolness coffin, I stand by my original statement that Legolas is hot.   P.S. go see Ms. California's blog for pics.

      Fall break begins in, like, 20 minutes.  I don't know why I'm so excited, it's not like I'm taking a break from work or anything.  See all these binders sitting on my carrel?  Chirping,"Don't forget me!  Don't forget me!"     So onward home!  See you next week!

      Alright...I was having a good morning...Lord of the Rings was on cable this morning while I was eating breakfast...I had yogurt for breakfast with cherries...they came out with tomato soup on the go...I finally finished  Gaudium et Spes .  And then Catholic Social Thought happened.  Oh yes.  And women's rights came up.  And the paradigm of the family unit came up.  And, that's right, in the year 2003 in a classroom with female colleagues, some of the guys fervently argued that a return to the nuclear family, i.e--one in which the woman stays home and has babies--would solve the world's problems.  Mom--I want to thank you for staying home with me.  I love you.  I respect you.  I know it helped to make me the person that I am.  However, I am not putting myself 100K in debt to have some guy's children.  I was so upset, I was shaking.  Brady, who is used to conservative, National Review toting, Church loving Courtney was highly amused.  And the royal smackdown cometh.  I could not believe what I was hearing...that society went down the tubes when women entered the workforce and started leaving the home.  How do these people make it this far, being this educated and still think that the only way I can flourish and contribute to this world is by using my God given ovaries to bear and rear some man's children?  So I raised my hand, slowly because I was completely enraged. A slight digression is in order.  First of all, this is not what the Church teaches at all.  The Church teaches that marriage is a free and equal partnership in which both parties continually give and recieve love to and from one another.  As both parties are beneficiaries of this love, both parties are called to be active givers of love.  The misconception of marriage that we heard today is not the Magisterium's fault.  Rather, the people who disseminate what the Church truly teaches have colored it to their own advantage.  If you look at prominent Catholic scholars, with the exception of 2 I can think of, they are all men.  Coincidence?  I think not.  But I digress.   I went on to say that the true meaning of marriage is an equal partnership.  That means that both parties recieve in the relationship, but both parties also make sacrifices.  Each must be open to God's word in their life.  Maybe God is calling some women to solely be mothers.  Maybe he's calling them to find the cure for cancer.  I can't decide for anyone else other than myself.  It's just possible I'm being called to be more than a baby producing machine.  Isn't it curious that this entire conversation has been framed in women leaving the home and thus contributing less to the household?  How can the woman who, being called to find the cure for cancer, works outside the home be criticized as neglecting her duties, while the man who works 70 hours a week and only sees his kids when they are sleeping is praised as a good breadwinner?  That's crap.  The reason that marriage has dissentigrated as an institution in the last 50 years is due to a disorded notion and value of self: sacrifice is no longer a part of marriage (well, secularly, anyway).  When you have two people who are in a marriage because of what they get and that's it, it's no small wonder the divorce rate is so high.   This is about equality, and about men finally kicking in and doing more than putting money in the bank account.  This is about equality and women being allowed to flourish in their God given calling as more than incubators.  If the true paradigm of marriage is the Trinity, aren't all parties equal there?  You bet they are.  So eat that you misogenistic, anachronisms.  See, you can be a good Catholic and a feminist...so there!

      Thanks to those of you who are joining me from the old website.  Yes, this is Miss California's idea...you'll have to check out her adventures in London when I post the link to her site.  ANYWAY, this format makes it easier for me to post and archive rather than the old one.  But don't fear, the old website will still have fun pics and that sort.  SEE THE OLD  urlLink WEBSITE !!

       QUOTE OF THE SEMESTER:  When discussing ecumenism (which I can't spell for beans) and the proper role of the Church in our pluralistic society, a good friend of mine had this to say.  "Last time I checked, Saint Peter's buried in my Church, not yours.  It's not like Calvin made that christianity stuff up.  Well, maybe Brigham Young did, but still..."

      New lesson from law school: Do not drink 32 ounces of diet coke before your hour and fifteen minute class.  Caffeine or potty dance?  You decide.  Leaving for Indianapolis with the BF tomorrow.  The BF, aside from being generally the most wonderful guy on earth, has offered to take me shopping on Friday.  I love him.  Even if he threatend to kick my ass at scrabble.  Bring it, PhD boy.    I baked 10 dozen pumpkin cookies with my very special vanilla icing.  That's right.  I created my first recipe.  I used another recipe for the base but added some of my special ingredients.  A little sugar, a little spice, a little Chemical X.  Surprisingly, no PowerPuff Girls emerged from my mixing bowl.  But a great vanilla glaze did!  Mmmmmm glaze!  What's one of the best things about the holidays?  Cooking of course!  I find baking bread especially theraputic, probably because it involves punching the dough down.  Father Dominic has the best recipe for stuffing bread.  I reccomend it with leftover turkey, brie, and cranberries.  Happy Thanksgiving, safe travels to all who are leaving home over the holiday and God bless us all!

      This weekend: Thanksgiving in the Bend.  We demolished a 23 lb. turkey, 10 bottles of wine, 4 different casseroles, 3 types of pie, 2 types of potatoes, and a box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts.  Yeah, this holiday rocks.

      Yes, I'm taking a break from my Finnis paper to confess: I went to  urlLink Britney Spears  website.  I know, I know--curiousity is definitely a vice in this sense.  And its cummulative to whine about Britney and her lack of talent.  But hey, this is my blog.  And for better of for worse, this is what's keeping me from finishing an otherwise brilliant paper on the Thomistic Contours of the Property Right.  I didn't have a problem with Britney Spears until now.  She was a pop icon I would never let my kids dress like.  Period.  Other than that, I admit it, her dance songs were catchy and yes, I had "Hit Me Baby One More Time" as an MP3 when I was in college.  That being said, now she's just forcing whatever "sexual revolution" is going on in her promotion.  It all started with an interview I read on AOL.  She described her confusion as to the social tummult she has contributed to.  And then there was the  urlLink quote : "I don't know why people are upset.  It's not like I'm going to show my crotch or anything."  (Congrats for having high moral standards, Britney).  I laughed--I mean, how could you not?  And then there was the kiss on tv.  Again.  I expect these things from Christina Aguilera--she has admitted (in song, no less) that she is "Dirrrrrty."  I laughed.  I didn't see the big deal.  If she wants to promote herself as an "entertainer" (i.e. "jailbait sexpot") that's her problem.  Just don't whine that no one understands your music or takes it seriously.  Finally, there's the new album.  I've heard the "Me Against the Music" song.  It sounds just like "Slave 4 U" from the last album.  Well, plus Madonna (Which, by the way, what  are   you doing?).  But the best is this song on her album called "Touch of My Hand."  If you're not snickering about the innuendo in the title, you ought to be.  That's right, Britney Spears wrote a song about, well,  that .   She describes it as "Freaky, but not freaky freaky."(Whatever the hell that means). Guess she's not that innocent, huh?

       Good things : Post It notes came out with a program that allows you to put digital stickies on your desktop.  "Call Brady."  "Grandma's Birthday."  "Out of Beer."  These things are better than toast.  And I invented the paste that goes on the back.   Bad things : More proof that profs here think I'm dumb.  I was used in a lecture example as "an expert witness in make-up application."  All you people who think I'm dumb, screw you.  In ten years, everyone will know who I am.  Mostly because I invented the paste that goes on the back of post it notes.

      Because one time isn't enough... I went to student health for the second time in less than a week to beg for antibiotics.  For those of you who don't know the story, I started hacking my lungs up sometime last week and as it kept getting worse I began to become concerned that, well, something was wrong.  So I went to student health where the guy listened to my heart and told me I had a chest cold.  I'll give you ten bucks if you can tell me what my heart has to do with my sinuses.  Anyway, his advice?  Take some robitussin and come back if you're dead. So this morning (a week later, mind you) I am still hacking and now my nose is running and I've got sinus pressure and I feel, in general, like crap.  I blew off Evidence and got drugs.  Which I had to pay $35 bucks for (I think thats 14 pounds sterling for you, Miss Cali).  Anyway, I'm pretty sure my money is going to cello lessons for the CFO's daughter, not to fund the cure for AIDS so I'm totally on board right now with the AARP lower prescription drug plans.    IN OTHER NEWS...WE WON A FOOTBALL GAME.  Okay, we pulled it out in, quite literally, the last 5 seconds.  But a messy win still goes in the W final.  So if we can win one more game (BYU?) we might get to go to a bowl game.  Granted it will be the Toilet Bowl in Flushing, NY but it's a building year, right?  Target has these great things now...Wine Cubes.  And as Father J says, "Wow.  Target has a way of making everything cool.  Even boxed wine."  It comes in a virtual bevy of tasty flavors including my personal favorite, a nice shiraz.  Look for it at the next tailgate.

      On a slightly more serious note, our source in the Political Science department raises an interesting question.  If Roe v. Wade were overturned and abortion made illegal, how would you punish the women who recieved illegal abortions?  Would you equate their actions with murder, manslaughter, or would you ignore their transgression in order to pursue the doctors who provide illegal abortions?  PS seems to think that prosecuting the doctors would be the best choice: after all we are dealing with a generation of women who were raised with the notion that a fetus is not a human being at all (what exactly it is otherwise, I have never found out).  How could you hold a person responsible for their actions if they didn't think they were doing something wrong?  How could they have the pre-requisite  mens rea    for murder if they never intended to kill "another human being?"  An interesting proposal...put aside whatever your views are on abortion (pro-choice/pro-life) and think about this...I'm still thinking about it myself, as I think it's a difficult and interesting puzzle.  Comments???

      Today was Thursday.  I'm still waiting to hear back about the solo I tried out for last night.  My voice is a little raw to day on account of A) the drastic shift in weather --it was 70 on Tuesday and I think it broke 45 today; and B) I sang for four hours yesterday.  As if that weren't enough, by 8:50 this morning, we had discussed homosexuality, pedophilia, and, well, "self-pleasure."  Yeah.  And you thought Aquinas and Natural Law were boring....

      Halloween...was this weekend.  I went as a Valkyrie (the Norse Goddess, not the motorcycle) and my roomate went as a "saucy" pirate.  Wednesday night was the SBA (Student Bar Association) party where the winners of the costume contest had dressed up like Mormon Missionaries.  I admit.  It was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen.  Especially when they were drinking beer on stage and the DJ had to remind them that Mormons don't drink.  Other costumes of note: I think the entire Grad section of the Sociology department went as the cast of Star Trek (the original).     Several Indiana Joneses, though only one had the luck lighter (if you don't know what I'm talking about, run, don't walk to rent "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" one of the best movies ever made.  If you do know what I'm talking about, surf over to Amazon and buy me the box set of Indiana Jones Movies with special directors cuts--only 60 odd shopping days until Christmas)  Anyway, the best costume by far was a friend of mine who dressed as our lovable, if eccentric, resident natural law scholar/Oxford Don  urlLink John Finnis --complete with Aquinas Commentary on Aristotle in hand.   As for the football game: yeah, we suck. But tailgating was good.  I made perogies from scratch (a little harder than initially anticipated)  and I smelled like Hickory Smoked Bratwurst for a full day after the game.  So let's talk about the team and the mass suckage that we witnessed-- We will probably lose to BYU, a team that was beaten by Boise St. 57 to 3 this weekend.  See, the mormons get the last laugh in the end.

      While most people are festively feasting and drinking, the rents and I busted in the New Year by running a 5K to benefit Juvenile Diabetes.  Running was definitely not part of the plan.  In fact, my mother has pulled something in her leg so she said we would walk the 5K and, having not worked out  for real      in 6 weeks (due to that pesky thing we call "finals") I was cool with walking 3.1 miles.  We pony up to the start line and my mother says "Yeah, I think we're going to run."   Excuse me?      So run we did, I mistakenly thinking that my mother's gimp leg would slow her down.  She kicked my ass.  So did 154 other people (I came in 155th) including members of the AARP and Chuckie Cheese's Kids Club.  So I am hopelessly out of shape.  And sore.  And wishing I were anywhere but BFE (in London with an Irish Car Bomb in hand sounds good).  Must go drag what is left of body to the Cat Pad for some serious nap action.  Ringing in the new year?  I've done it 23 times.  I'm over it.  P.S.  My time for the 5K was 31:30.  I could have watched half of Law and Order with a martini.  KAHN!!!!

       Mad Cow Strikes Walton's Mountain  We went to El Chico's on Saturday after Mass--I could go on a tirade about how El Chico is a tolerable Mexican restaurant  only    because it is one of two Mexican restaurants in the entire Tri-Cities area--but that would be an unneeded digression.  So we go to El Chico and I get a taco salad.  It comes out with all of this ground beef in it.  My parents notice that I am picking around the groud beef.  My mom asks what's going on? Me: "Well, with that whole Mad Cow thing, I don't want to get sick." Mom: "Oh, honey, law school has made your brain swiss cheese already." Dad: "If it wasn't law school, it  definitely  was the martinis." Thank you parental units.  Your concern for your only child rises to new levels and continues to astound me.    In other news...we're going to the aquarium tomorrow!  Yay!  With real 11 foot sharks and sea turtles.  Righteous!! RIGHTEOUS!!!

      Okay.  So the terrorists were after two targets.  Sin city and the  urlLink Vatican .  Las Vegas?  I understand.  It is the zenith of all things that are wrong with western consumerism including (just to name a few) a completely disordered value of money and pleasure (of all types).  While I don't agree with blowing it up, it makes sense that a radical Islamic organization like Al Qaeda would have it on its "honey do" list.  But the Vatican?  Come on kids.  Pope John Paul told the US not to turn your backyard into a gigantic plane of glass.  What did we ever do to you?  (You know, taking that whole messy "crusades" thing off the table.)  Of course, the Italian Prime Minister (who just this summer called the German Prime Minister a goose stepping moron), said the threat was credible, but then said his statement on the threat had been  urlLink completely made up  by some Italian journalist.  Meanwhile,  urlLink L'Osservatore Romano  (the Vatican Newspaper) has said nothing and Joaquin Navarro-Valls, Papal Spokesperson, is saying "No Comment."  How does one say "fishy" in Italian?

      Alright, since my current blog is a bit schizo (and I mean that in the most politically correct way possible) I decided to separate out my opinions...law school/social commentary will remain here (who wouldn't want to miss out on the social upheaval my friends and I cause on a regular basis?) while honest to goodness political commentary can now be seen at  urlLink The Common Good .  What?  As of 630p Saturday night there's nothing there?  Cut me some slack!  I just had this brilliant idea on the way home from antique shopping.  The Common Good will be a weekly post (unless news circumstances call for otherwise) on, well, anything that's current and fair game.  I hope to have the first post up on Monday and make it a Monday sort of thing.  If you have suggestions email me.  If you want to find out if I passed my third semester of law school, stay tuned here.

More to come tomorrow...I'm tired and want to shower.  Eomer is my hero(ine).  Legolas is hot (I know, I'm a 12 year old girl at heart), and while the end is a bit long, it ties up all the lose ends.  THey shot a 5 hour movie and edited down to 3 and a half.  I can't wait to see the extended cut.  It'll be great!

It is now snowing on Walton's Mountain, Tennessee where I currently sit, visiting my parents and eating cheese like it's going out of style.  We are supposed to get something like 3 inches.  I scoff at snow.  I am from the tundra.  But if it gets in the way of my LOR action tonight.  I'll be pretty darned upset.

      So some of you know about the idol worship some members of the WLC have of our fearless leader.  Those of us older students, while probably secretly in love with our director on some level ourselves, draw great amusement from the googly-eyed youngins.  It gives us something to talk about.  Something to gush over.  One more reason law school is really more like high school than college.  This is from a conversation this week:  X: "He gave me a hug when I turned in my folder." Y: "He gave you a hug?  Wow, I'm so jealous." X: "Yeah, but it was kind of weird." Y: "Oh, because of the intense love and devotion between you both?" X: "Yeah, that's exactly what he said as he put his pants back on."  Warped?  Us?  Never!  ***Author's legally paranoid note...this post, however vague, is not meant to insinuate or report accurately in anyway an incident that probably violates 3/4 of DuLac.  Rather, we bring you this coversation in the light spirit of finals.  Or as the result fo 6 diet dr. peppers.  There is no slander, libel, or defamation here...we promise!*****

      So it is officially 24 hours until the Evidence exam.  I've studied so much that I feel numb right now.  But after I type this, I'm going to fill up my coffee mug and get back at it.  I am seriously living for 1230pm tomorrow--when I can fill out my christmas cards, frost the cookies,  and wrap presents.  I feel bad whining because there are those out there who have it worse than I--There are finals and papers due right up until Saturday.  But boy am I glad this semester is almost over.

       I AM THE VAST RIGHT WING CONSPIRACY!  MWA HA HA HA HA The woman riding the scarlet beast, drunk on the blood of martyrs.... will recieve her comeuppance and it will be at my hand.  Just like the story of Judith, the pious Jewess who delivered her people from oppression, I too will slay the wicked with my sword of truth.  And the wicked will fear me.  And they shall cower behind their words and their soundbytes.  And they shall try and convince the people that they  have the truth--just like the false prophets that came before them. I am a servant of the secret fire--and they shall not pass!  I am talking about a battle of biblical proportions.  It's coming.  It looms on the horizon.  The first vollies have been returned.  But this will truly be a battle for the soul of America--AND I SHALL BE THEIR QUEEN--BEAUTIFUL AS THE NIGHT AND TERRIBLE AS THE MORNING!  I'm going to go get some water--I think the coffee and sugar has gone to my brain...

      Canon law... ...is history.  I don't think I've ever used the word "interrelationship" so much in my life.  Two blue books later (count 'em TWO!) I finished with just enough time to look back and think "&#*$!  I didn't cover infallibility!"  So there, enshrined on the left side and demarcated with an arrow is my paragraph about "Papal and Magisterial Authority--or why we have to believe all that credo stuff."  Career options #467 and #309 (canon lawyer and ambassador to the Holy See, for those of you who aren't keeping track) not looking so good.  On the bright side...less than two weeks to christmas!

      New question for discussion...is white zin (as in the wine) an acceptable drink for males?  This came up when one of my friends (whose identity will be kept secret to protect his classless ass) talked about how his drink of choice was white zin.  My response?  White zin is for freshman sorority girls.  Choir dinner was tonight...I don't ever want to eat pizza again.  I'm taking a break from studying evidence while my brain is strung out on hearsay.  205 questions in 3 1/2 hours.  Pass the bottle, my friends.

      More reasons I don't suck: A.  I won my trial this weekend.  That's right, I successfully defended a guy accused (falsely, of course) of killing his wife.  Our dear contact in the ND Political Science department served as the defendant and almost had the jury in tears while testifying how much he loved his wife.  It was great.  Finally, something I don't suck at in law school! B.  We took seconc place in the Umpteenth Annual Christmas Decorating contest in the graduate student complex.  It was way fun and they loved our National Lampoon's christmas theme.  Don't know what that means?  Think of the tackiest decorations you can and multiply that by, like, a hundred.

      Finals has hit in all of its insanity--in my case obsessing over choir and preparing for trial--unfortunatley simultaneously.  Roomie had a good view on the matter.  In speaking of earlier incidents at choir practice involving bread, Michigan, and a pink sweatshirt, I had said, "She's just jealous.  'Yeah, you better recognize who is the best mezzo-soprano, mofo!'" Roomie started re-arranging the magnetic poetry on her board and said, "It's too bad the word 'roomate' isn't on here, 'cause the word "crack" is."  Unfortunately, as twisted as my world is right now, if you don't get this joke, it is probably for the better.  If you are putting of working, writing, studying, or grading, email me and I'll tell you the whole story.  Maybe we can go hang out with Hawaii.  Alaska can come to, yo.

      So I stayed up until 11 studying last night.  Between studying, class, and a few "end of semester" meetings, that meant I worked for almost 13 hours straight.  I woke up at 7 this morning feeling like I had gotten steamrolled.  At least now, I've memorized everything pertaining to the original document rule and authentication of real and demonstrative evidence.  You don't know what I'm talking about?  Don't worry.  Neither do I.  Anyway.  Break can't come fast enough right now...grrr, finals.

And he's got a harpoon in there so when a herd of caribou come around the Grotto, he can have a tasty Bou-Burger for dinner.  Freak. ...Our Fearless Leader was not at choir practice yesterday which meant two things: A) we were hopelessly efficient and got out of practice in 45 minutes.  B) The undergrads had no one to flirt with.  Actually, it means a third thing--no fun news from Womens Lit Choir to post.  Blah.  Boring week.

       Good day...  My case finally wrapped up today with a deal that's good for everyone.  So my supervising attorney walks over to me and gives me one of those power handshakes and says, "Congratulations, counselor."  And I got chills.  Counselor.  That's right, you intelectual weenies.  While you are locked in the flourescent lighting of the basement I'm out saving the world.  It was one of those moments that makes law school worth it.  Bad day...  So where in the world is Strasburg, anyway?  If you said "Austria," you're in the special helmet category with me.  Unfortunately, when answering the professor's question about why English people may not want to go to the highest court of appeal in the EU (which is in Strasburg), I answered, "Because, isn't that in Austria?  That's kind of far away."  Mad props to the Prof who, struggling to help me save face said something along the lines of, "Well,   it IS in France,   but to go to France is pretty much the same difference as going to Austria for an Englishman."  Did I mention that I made it to the National Geography Bee in junior high?  There was no freaking question about Strasburg there.  Stupid France.  Texas is bigger.

       When the law isn't fair...    We had a discussion in remedies this morning about what happens if breach of employment occurs.  Besides lost wages what else can be recovered for damages--like health insurance, etc.  I mentioned house payments.  I was told that house payments were too remote to be considered damages for the following reasons: 1) It isn't foreseeable that if you breach an employment contract that they will be unable to pay their mortgage. 2) It is assumed that the injured party has other recourse, such as borrowing money from friends or taking out a loan. Okay, I'm back.  As to point 1--are you kidding?  That's heartless.  What do you think your employees do, put maximum bling down for their house and pay 10 bucks a month?  Or the opposite, they live in a box.  Or their Honda CRV.  As to point 2--who borrows $800 a month from friends to make their mortgage?  Who HAS friends who can loan you $800 to pay the mortgage?  And what bank is going to give a loan to an unemployed person?  I don't know jack about business, but isn't that the definition of high risk?     I think someone has been living in the Ivory Tower a little too long.  Period.

       You Can't Always Get What You Want  ...an 80 degree day in the Bend---It has snowed for five days straight and the sun hasn't come out in what feels like weeks.  I feel like a mole (if moles lived in the frozen wasteland of Siberia). ...a student leadership organization that, well, leads.  Don't get me wrong.  I understand that Student Bar isn't just a party planning organization.  But they aren't even doing that well this year.  They put our semi-formal dance at the local baseball park.  I'm sure it's in the press box or something like that but still....no one I know is going.  I think only 30 people are "signed" up to go--meaning 30 people bought tickets.  We're all going to a "pre-party" at a friend's house and then heading out to LaSalle.  A $15 ticket?  That's two martinis--are you kidding me?  ...But You Can Try Some Time  ...In an attempt to fix the aforementioned party situation, a friend in a student organization wanted to hold a Mardis Gras fundraiser.  She was promptly shut down by student bar who said they have cornered the market on Mardis Gras Parties.  Well, no offense, but that party sucked last year.  We went to Coaches (now the infamous Bookmakers), stood around and drank, and left after an hour and a half.  So Roomie and I, after lamenting the terminal illness of the Mardis Gras party--because history will repeat itslef--decided to come up with the social event to be at in february.  Oh, and to raise money for a good cause.  Once we decide on a theme (pirates, political, jungle, under the sea) stay tuned for details!  ...You Just Might Find--You Get What You Need  ...a fulfilling class schedule.  Well, maybe not business associations.  But after all, it just isn't a class until the Norman Invasion of 1066 is mentioned. ...you client is not smoking crack.  After interviewing my client (and having my heart wrenched out in the process) I am so excited about working in the legal aid clinic!  It feels so good to help people.  And the 50 cent diet dr. peppers help.  A lot. ...tour looms happily in the distance.  Katie and I are making bus snacks.  Cookies, brownies, and maybe a few vodka soaked oranges. ...Dean's list.

I can see the streets I walked down so clearly sometimes, but especially the Holborne area--where the ancient Inns of Court are located.  It is almost as if some small part of my soul was always there.  And I find it difficult to explain to most people that I felt the most connected when I was standing in the oldest places.  Anyway, after finishing this pensiveness, I am going back to the "Duke of Glouster" (a 16th century song that was played in Henry VIII's court) and my books...

       How do you say "Debuque"?  Roomie and I watched the Iowa Caucuses last night, like the two Polisci nerds we are.  And we are amused at the similarity between the caucus and a 1st grade StuCo election.  Seriously, they gather in houses, gymnasiums, and auditoriums across the great corn-laden state of Iowa, discuss the issues, and then someone shouts "Okay, if you are for Dean, go to that corner!  If you are for Kerry, go to that corner!"  Amazing.  It's so Toquevill-ian I want to cry.  And so too did Wolf Blitzer and Co.  Every five minutes..."this is such a great expression of the American ideal."  So Roomie and I have decided we want in.  We want to go to the Iowa caucus at some point.  We want to be separated out into piles like political laundry.  And we want Wolf Blitzer to cry over how Apple Pie American we are.

       There and Back Again  So I arrived sometime Sunday and unpacked my junk, cleaned the apartment, went to church and collapsed.  And you're upset because I haven't written in a few days?  Pffft.  You try law school.  I dare you.  I have just returned from seeing the BF in New Orleans where he gave a spectacular discussion on why the Church was completely entitled to burn heretics at the stake.  Well, not really.  Though he did use the phrase, "Modern conceptions of religion and spirituality today are so....flowery."  Yeah.  I'm sure the Pope's on line 1 to get BF's view on the importance of ecumenism.   Also ate way too much cajun food and paid for it with heartburn.  But it was good heartburn.  The type that lets you know you're alive.  Or makes you feel like an anaconda that swallowed a cow.  You pick.     Training Wheels for Lawyers  ...also known as the legal aid clinic where I will be working this semester.  had to do a mock client interview on Monday which resulted in me laughing most of the way through.  This simulation stuff is hard.  Because I see Joe, and I hear Joe, but Joe is talking like he's on crack.  Or nuts.  Or just maybe a little bit of both.  So I laugh.  And the supervising attorneys see it and sweat bullets about accepting the Legally Blonde chick into their clinic.  I promise I won't send anyone to jail who doesn't belong there.  Honest!   In other class news, I have been magically transported back to college.  Every professor I have started our semester long jaunt together by saying, "Yeah, I just want to look over the syllabus.  Then you can go."  Not that I'm complaining of course.  Two diet cokes and a nap on Ms. Nebraska's couch later, I feel much more inclined to engage the world of comparative legal traditions.  Or laugh at some of the people who are in class with me.  I guess it's just going to depend on what kind of day it is.   More posts to come.  And that other website?  The Common Good?  Yeah, I'm working on it.  Hopefully next week kids.  in the meantime, discuss amongst yourselves.

      So I finally figured out how to put pictures on ye olde website.  Special thanks to  urlLink Queens Council of Ohio  for patiently staying with me over AIM and talking me down from hating on HTML code.  HTML sucks and I don't understand that, in a world where Penguins can ride NASA junk back to civilization (if you don't get it, put down the editorials and pick up the Sunday comics), why I have to type in Martian and fear the misplacement of a single set of quotation marks in order to make my webiste pretty.  --sigh--  In other news, there is justice in this world: sometimes.  After a disappointing third or fourth (I've lost track) album, media-crowned Princess of Pop Britney Spears has " urlLink tied the knot " in a graceful and refined ceremony in Las Vegas.  Word on the street is that the lawyers are already involved.  Look for a tearful interview to come in the next 6 months--no, look for two interviews--the first one where she and her new hubby appear on Barbara Walters and proclaim their undying love for one another and the second where, after the no-fault divorce, she blames society and the music industry for pushing her into it while pontificating that she has to be true to herself.

       It's Friday in South Bend...  ...which is the Mecca of all that is Catholic second only to Rome.  The scuttlebutt around campus?  That the Fascist Catholic administration won't serve meat in the dining halls on Fridays during Lent.  What is interesting is that the administration allows the continuing serving of meat and meat products in LaFortune--the Student Union--which houses a Burger King, Subway, Sbarro, and mini-mart.  So you're upset about no meat in the dining hall?  You miss the mysterious meatloaf?  Walk your ass over to Burger King--as one of the letters pointed out, a cheeseburger is, like, a buck.  In addition to fixing your meat craving, it also is easier on your pocket book. ...where there are approximately 2 seafood restaurants.  We went to Red Lobster yesterday and, after nursing a glass of shiraz at the bar for 45 minutes, we finally got seated.  Even better, our waitress spoke less than perfect english.  She screwed up our drink orders.  The restaurant was crowded and I could barely hear all of the voices in my head.  When Miss Nebraska "over-enunciated"  the word "lime" to make sure she could be heard over the masses of people, we could tell the waitress was ticked.  But the food still tasted good.  Hopefully they didn't spit in it.   ...in other exciting news...while were planning our seafood adventure in rehearsal, the MichiGander told us(i.e. Miss DuLac and I) he wants in.  He literally told us he wants to go to dinner with us.  What has four thumbs and is the coolest thing in the choir...these guys.

       An Open Note to Those Who Wield Power Over Syllabi and Other Assorted Torture Devices  Hi.  I appreciate the time you put into planning a class--no really I do!  Having experienced the joy of teaching myself, as well as being the progeny of a teacher and dating a potential-teacher, I employ no snark in this commentary.  However, I do have one helpful suggestion.  When you expect students to be "prepared" for class, it's probably better to give them a concrete explanation of exactly what you mean by "prepared."  For example, telling students, "Well, stay 25 pages ahead" or "Stay 2 assignments on the syllabus ahead" doesn't really cut it.  I know it seems all flexible and easier for everyone, but in truth, it isn't.  Because let's face it...sometimes you can take a day to cover 15 pages.  And sometimes, if you're moving quickly, you can cover 15 pages in 15 minutes.  And due to the increasing solar flares, my psychic abilities are waning.  (Okay, so that was a little bit snarky).  But seriously, folks.  You want us prepared for class and we want to be prepared for you.  So help a sister out.  A little more detail on the assignments wouldn't hurt anyone.  Thanks. (goes back to preparing for class).

       Odds and Ends  ...Remedies: We get a glance at Gallagher's past life in New York, inlcuding a negotiation with teamsters that apparently ended when the cigar-smoking head teamster smiled and said, "Don't worry, we got udda ways."   ...I still suck at bowling.  But at least some scary guy drinking a Bud wasn't trying to give me pointers.  I bowled a grand 64 last night once again proving you can't be designated driver and a good bowler.  Period. ...Look for a post on the  urlLink Common Good  later today.  I have a bevy of topics I would like to post on, but will probably post my views on Gibson's "The Passion."  In the meantime, for the first pallatable argument (I've heard, anyway) against the gay marriage amendment look no further than  urlLink The Mirror of Justice . ...And then there was the auction.  We were going to bid, we promise.  But then we saw the expectant look on the undergrads faces and, realizing that all we would have to do is ASK the MichiGander to go to dinner with us, we tried to help them outbid some boys whom we are assuming are from the Liturgical Choir.  Scary blue robes...yikes.  In any event, there was--regretfully--no cat fight.  But, the auctioneer called the MichiGander "hot."  Diabetes research gets money and I'm entertained.  Everyone wins.

Add that to the four cups of coffee I had this morning and poof: you've got the sugar/caffeine high from hell.  I am invincible!  Or I will be until aproximately 2 o'clock when my brain shuts off for class.  Sigh.  Onward ever onward...

       The Weekend that Was  So I spent the greater part of yesterday either singing or preparing to sing.  Yikes.  Went with Miss DuLac herself to get shoes.  In the process of trying on lucite wedges and conversing about the Mass, a salesperson overheard us and asked if we went to the local Baptist church.  When we replied no, that we sang at Notre Dame, she said, "Oh.  I went to a Catholic service once.     It didn't do it for me."  Congrats.  How do you respond to a statement like that?  Some people... Then there was the Michigander at the Mass...pacing the floor of the basketball court (where we were singing) and flapping wildly to the music--technically conducting, but there was no one there.  As Jenny, El Presidente said, "How am I supposed to sing with a straight face?  That's the most distracting thing I've ever seen."

       Chaos Theory  What happens when you cram the entire Sacred Heart Basilica Music Ministry into one room?  Structured chaos.  Last night we had practice for the Junior Parents weekend mass.  All three Basilica choirs and the Glee Club and their directors came together for one glorious 90 minute rehearsal.  The ladies of the WLC were extremely happy to be singing with BOYS.  The glee club director, aside from being extremely hyper, did not speak discernable english.  "I want you to POW POW POW!!!" Um, sure.  Enter the director of the folk choir who, in addition to composing half of the pieces we are singing at this Mass, acted out on his King David complex and started playing the harp in the middle of rehearsal.  Sur-real.  He then gave us what I can only describe as a "pep talk" after announcements.  "This Mass is really important and is our way of thanking the junior class.  It's so special that you are all here, volunteering your time and God-given talents...blah blah blah."  Right.  We'll go out there and sing one for the Gipper.  Thanks, dude.

       American History X  Once again plumbing the depths of law school stupidity, I am not dissappointed.  This gem was reported to me by a friend who overheard it in class.  Alexander Hamilton, father of the federalist papers and proponent of American enterpeneurship, all around swashbuckler and hell-raiser, was apparently the topic of conversation.  Referring to Hamilton's reputation as an avid duelist, said colleague, "Wasn't he a gang banger or something?"  Hmmm.  Welcome to graduate school.  Where it's all fun and games until someone confuses a founding father with a member of the Bloods.  Sweet.

       Returning from a  Successful Tour...   After almost 20 hours in a bus we (actually) had a good time.  I'll update a little later today (I have to go to the store now) but here's the hit-list of things I learned in Nashville: 1. Some choir members have unique talents such as gun-slinging and lyric writing.  However, no one is good at pool. 2.  I am still capable of picking up men.  Well, if a couple of guys from the "Tractor Pull Convention" count.  Other amusing bar stories include, but are not limited to, the picking up of a fireman by some of the younger crowd and the myth that our Vice President is really a closeted nun. 3. Michigander's cholesterol is 171.  Don't ask. 4. Don't irritatte the wait staff by trying to make their life easier.  They will give you dirty dishes and throw things at you. 5. Enjoy yourself, because the next thing you know, you're on the bus headed back to the frozen hell-hole that is South Bend.

       Driving Miss Manda  Even though I l ive a brisk 15 minute walk from the Law School I had to drive today to make a 1030a meeting.  With me came Roomie who is also in my 9am class.  On the way in from the parking lot, we had this conversation... Me: You know it's cold.  I should actually take my gloves out of my purse and wear them. Roomie: Why don't you just put them on in the first place? Me: I can't wear gloves when I drive? Roomie: Why not?  I wear my gloves when I drive. Me: I've  seen  the way you drive, Roomie. Roomie: Yeah, but that has nothing to do with my gloves.

       The Magical Mystery Tour--Part II  ...is officially "go."  Let the bus snack making commence--though not tomorrow as I am returning my hair to it's semi-natural color.  Speaking of, lets have a moment of silence for my Platinum Phase. --  Okay.  So it seemed like a freaking brilliant idea at the time.  I just never thought about the rootage.  But I digress.   So apparently the slackers who dropped felt guilty after either A) the president's brilliantly delivered speech to a captive audience in the robing room or B) The MichiGander's passive aggressive guilt trip.  Who cares...we're getting out of this frozen hell hole for 72 whole hours.  Will post the schedule tomorrow (it's late and I'm tired).  Just be excited--Kentucky and Tennessee will never be the same.  I think that the MichiGander is a bit bummed about not visiting Walton's Mountain.  I told him we could visit the Land of all that is Dolly and go on the boob ride next year.  I think he's excited (but not that way, cause that would be gross.)  Anyway, joy has returned to my week and the next three days will be busy but tolerable.  Yay me!

       The Magical Mystery Tour  ...to Nashville may very well be canceled.  Aparently, out of 52 of our Choir members, 41 signed up to go, 35 paid, and now the number is at 28--roughly half of the choir.  Our director, the MichiGander, is not amused, and we don't blame him.  Thus, for those of you who wanted to come hear me sing, I have no concrete info: Katie and I remain hopefull that, after being locked in the robing room of the Basilica with an irritated officer team, some of the undergrads will come to their senses and sign their rear ends back up.  In the meantime, stay tuned for details.

       Saturday Night's Alright For...  ...driving around Northern Indiana looking for a place and almost ending up in   Michigan.  Katie and I have come to several conclusions after the past few days: 1.  In our list of demands for going on tour, we should have made McShane cook dinner for us. 2.  The strip of Business 31 that runs north of the University looks oddly like Northern Virginia (Chain Bridge Road, specifically) 3.  We are the WLC equivalent of Merry and Pippen: the two funny hobbits. 4.  Elia's Mediterranean food is awesome, even if I have heartburn everytime I eat it. Who said a weekend with no studying was a wash?

       Law School Roast  So the so-called "midpoint meeting" was, in the words of my russian grandmother, "a bust."  After asking such informative questions as "Do you value social justice?" { a colleague said, "No, I said 'screw poor people--the deserve everything they get.'  Who would be against social justice?"  Yeesh}  And "Do you think the faculty is friendly?"  They provide a solid two inches of space for "Other comments."  I should have simply directed them to this blog.  Career Services.  The blatant sexism and classism.  The arrogance and hypocrisy.  Someone said, "But that's what it's going to be like anywhere."  Well then Notre Dame shouldn't be advertising itself as a school for a "Different Kind of Lawyer" because that's what I signed up for.  The virtue of charity is supposed to be a big part of this curriculum and I fail to see it many times.  That's hypocrisy, gang.  And the most dissappointing thing, as Miss Nebraska pointed out, is that this place is capable of the whole "physician heal thyself" thing.  Well, maybe not Career Services.  But that is another rant for another time.  Look for the letter I'm writing for the Dean Review Committee in the future.  I will publish it in all of its eloquent glory.  As one of my professor's said first year, "If you don't feel this place is living up to its name, you need to hold its feet to the fire."  Well, it looks like its time to put another shrimp on the barbie, chap.

But you can't ask the question if you don't even know what to ask.  So I remain unemployed yet hopeful.  I figure I JD can at least get me to a management position at a Barnes and Noble. ...We were just talking yesterday--NOTHING FUNNY HAS HAPPENED.  What happened?

       Law Prom..(Or, Part III of How Law School is Really High School Revisited)  ...Special thanks to the BF who used frequent flier miles to visit the rainy, but warmer (65) Bend for the weekend and the crowning social event of Notre Dame's calendar--the Law Ball.  Things Roomie and I noticed this year: people were generally better dressed.  While a few girls came in what looked to be like old bridesmaids gowns, it could be concluded from this sole event that the law school is populated with good looking people (does that go into a US News and World Reports ranking?).  Also, significant others were out in force--I finally met several of the boyfriend/girlfriend/fiance/husband/wife of several of my colleagues (nice to put a face with a name).  And we got party favors.  Wine flutes that appear to have the EU logo on them commemorating this solemn event.  I think it's safe to say a good time was had by all. ...Meanwhile, back in the loft, how do you spell "cranky?"  "M-I-C-H-I-G-A-N-D-E-R."  With the Holy Week full court (erm, "Mass") press on, rehearsal was, erm, less than pleasant.  And we have several more chances this week to "feel the wrath."  Yay us.

You weren't supposed to.  Think of it as "pruning." Thursday Night--Katrina gets kicked off The Apprentice.  There's one woman left.  And she's an Aggie.  Sure she conveniently "forgot" that she came up with the crappy idea that made her team lose, but she's still one of our own.  GO AMY!  YOU CAN DO IT!  (And you can do sooooo much better than Nick....) Friday--Class.  Epiphany.  My attention span?  Aprox. 55 minutes long.  Period.  At least that's longer than most gold fish.     Tonight?  Why it's another FISH FRIDAY in the Bend.  I believe I'm cooking.  Will there be a special appearance by the ever-mysterious, ever-elusive MichiGander?  Stay tuned...

       Good Day, Bad Day  Good Day: I was offered a job at the clinic here meaning, A.  I can stay here for the summer and B. I have something productive to do with my break other than watching the Food Network.   Bad Day: I have not  been offered any jobs in the dorm.  Something about me being too old (read: graduating in a year).  Grrrrrr. Good Day: The WLC's organist put on a fantastic recital and is now substantively done with her masters.  So we went out with half the music department to celebrate.  Things I learned:  -There is a professional society for organists.  And they have conventions.  Where they recieve tote bags.   -Some people in the Lit Choir?  Very cool.  Including their organist.  Maybe we can steal him. -An inter-choir football league would not work because, as one colleague pointed out, we're down by a Y chromosone.  Actually, we're down by several. -The MichiGander has a admitted passion for--you guessed it--Star Trek.  Am I surprised?  Sadly, no.

And this year, I don't have ANY one to get behind as no one knows A&M has a basketball team and this year, ND was on the bubble (well, at least according to Dicky V).

While I shudder at the immediate mental comparison between life-mate and chia pet, I cannot help but wonder if the "smug married"s out there as well as the male readership agree?  We've all joked that men are easy to figure out, but is that really oversimplifying matters?  What does this say about the state of marriage in general?

And that as my legal education has progressed, my commentary has expanded from "Oh, he totally can't do that--but I can't remember why." to "Objection!  He can't ask that!  That was totally leading the witness!"  Ah, Law and Order, though you bring back painful memories of exam questions, I am still drawn to you--like a moth to the proverbial flame.

Would grown women buy and wear something that Jessica Simpson has advertised for?  Moreover, do grown women know who Jessica Simpson is?  B. I know the teeny-bopper market knows who she is, but what do they need with a cosmetic that is billed as "A fragrance.  A flavor. You wear it.  You share it."  Ew.  That's what I want at prom...as if I didn't have a miserable enough time, I want my date to, in addition to attempting to cop a feel, lick me at some point.  Yuck.   What?

       You know you have good friends when... . ...They put up with (and support) your eccentricities.  Most everyone who knows me well knows that I tried out for the Basilica Schola last year and failed miserably.  The exchange went something like this: "Well, you have a lovely voice.  Can you sight read music?" "Pffffft--no." "Hmmm, that's going to be a problem." So I was placed in the Michigander's choir with the hopes that my voice would strengthen, my sight reading skills would improve, and a full year later, I would be able to confidently stride up to the piano and knock 'em dead.   Here it is, a year later.  The Michigander picked out my audition piece and since he knows the director of the Schola, I feel pretty good about that.  The range of my voice has increased.  And I've learned to sight read music.  Sort of.  I can do it, but I feel like a dislexic (sp?) 3rd grader reading Dr. Suess.  Case and point, I've obsessed about the audition for the last six months and it is tomorrow. So how do you know you have good friends?  When you tell them you're nervous and they IM you the first lines of Eminem's "Loose Yourself."   "What if you had one shot.  One opportunity.  Loose yourself in the music the moment..." Miss California, you rock.  If I make the Schola, the first set we do is totally dedicated to your infinite goodness.

No serioiusly--does anyone remember the show  urlLink Legends of the Hidden Temple  on Nickelodeon?  This was prime 80s kid tv.  I wanted to go on so bad--the questions they asked were EASY.  "Who was the first Roman emperor who happened to get stabbed on the Ides of March by 50 of his friends?"  "Umm...that's really hard....Caligula?"  Okay, back to dignitarian based rights systems.

       From the Sublime to the Ridiculous...  ...For those of you who have visited  urlLink Christus Victor  recently I apologize for the redundancy of my commentary…For those of you not blessed enough to be in the Bland right now, here’s what’s going on.  A group of students organized a—well, it’s not a protest, but I’m too tired to figure out what to call it—wherein students bought and wore bright orange shirts that said “Gay?  Fine by me” on the front.  The first day was at the end of March.  The second day was yesterday.  Some members of the Saint Thomas More Society, of which I was an officer this past year, organized—without the knowledge of the officers (or at least without my knowledge) a “discussion” about the shirts.  They had a good turn out but it wasn’t really a discussion at all.  From all accounts it was a lecture on Catholic sexual ethics, among other things.  From what I can gather, the main problem that the sponsors of this panel had with the campaign was that the phrase, “Gay?  Fine by me” was an ambiguous phrase.  So ambiguous that it caused scandal of a canonical nature.  As a friend of mine recently offered, I was “neutral” on the subject before this week.  Now, I’d wear orange every damned day if I could.   I am going to begin this comment by admitting that I was not, in fact, at the panel on Tuesday night. Nor was I involved in its planning. I disagree that the shirt's message is ambiguous. In my view, as Catholics we are called to solidarity with all members of the Body of Christ, no matter what their sexual proclivities. Sometimes that message of solidarity gets lost in the heated rhetoric that abounds when discussing issues like gay civil unions, et al. It is in this light that I believe the shirts are a positive thing.  My understanding of the "ambiguity" surrounding the shirts is that it is unclear whether the wearer supports his homosexually oriented friends in a loving spirit of charity, or whether the wearer sees nothing wrong with the homosexual act. I think this point of ambiguity is overstated.  First, as I am not the only one to point out, someone who has homosexual attractions is not necessarily acting on them.  Aside from the grievous indignity it is to reduce a human being to a singular choice they may have made, to immediately assume that all people who have same-sex attractions will immediately act on them is just as fallacious as suggesting that all people who have opposite-sex attractions will act on them. In this sense, supporting and loving a member of the community who is gay is not the same as condoning the actions they may or may not take in the same way supporting and loving a member of the community who is heterosexual is not the same thing as condoning premarital sex. Secondly, I think it is extremely clear what the Church's teaching is on the matter of homosexuality. I refuse to believe that the people wearing the shirt or seeing wearers of the shirt would somehow be led into believing that the Church had reversed its long held prohibition on homosexual and extra-marital sexual acts. If anything, the shirt has prompted a frank discussion of Catholic sexual ethics.  Another friend posited if I would agree that “Alcoholic?  Fine by me” is ambiguous.  This is a red herring of an argument.  If making sure that recovering alcoholics in the community knew they were supported and loved no matter what they had done in the past, then I say it’s time to print up a new tee shirt.  However, at least to my knowledge, that’s not the case here.  And whatever ambiguity may or may not exist in the “Fine by Me” shirts should be resolved by people asking questions as simple as “Gee, Jim, why are you wearing that shirt?”  In the end, short of causing scandal, I believe such discussion good for the greater community and provides an innovative platform for evangelization.  This is a true teaching moment. So would Jesus wear an orange shirt?  I don’t know, as I don’t profess to know the thoughts of the Almighty.  But I’m pretty sure that the stories from the Gospel about how Jesus hung out with prostitutes, tax collectors, and other marginal elements of society lends a glimpse of the answer.  His was an example of unconditional love for everyone no matter what they have or haven’t thought or done.  Before someone gets there on my comments spot, I am fully aware that he told these people to “sin no more” after loving them.  To those people I say, “Duh.”  But before he got to the “sin no more” part, He let each of them—the woman at Samaria, the woman caught in adultery, the tax collectors—know that they were loved and valued. So I think of this tee shirt thing as that step.  Letting people know that they are valued, no matter what their sexual orientation may be, simply because they are created by God.  Period.  So now that I’ve given up any chance I had of being canonized, use the comments link.  I’m just downright curious what everyone else has to say.

       Happy Aggie Muster...  ...April 21st--the Commemoration of the Battle of San Jacinto in the Texas War for Independence--has been held as a traditionally "sacred" day in Aggie lore.  On this day, graduates of Texas A&M University will gather together and remember those who have gone before them into the next life.  Drawing from the rich military traditions that abound in Aggieland, a final "roll call" is solemnly read, listing off all those graduates and former students who have passed away.  After each name, the group gathered answers "Here"--a definitive statement of hope that the spirits of those who have died still gather around us.  It's a great tradition that brings all sorts of people together, from the campus Muster where thousands gather, to those of us who are a touch further flung and simply get a cup of coffee or beer together.   There is a great poem that is also read that says something like "Softly call the Muster; let the comrade answer 'Here!' Even now their spirits gather, as if to give us cheer."  Yes, friends, I am homesick for the fields of bluebonnets and indian paintbrushes that surround dear College Station.  I crave a Freebirds burrito.  I want to go to Sweet Eugene's for an Al Cappacino.  So as they call the Muster tonight in Reed Arena, I will answer "Here" mentally from my carrel here in northwestern Indiana.  God bless Texas.

       Here at the End of All Things... ...I know you all have been crushed that I haven't posted in a week.  Sadly, every creative juice has been transferred to writing my comparative legal traditions paper. You'll just have to wait until the cloud of stress passes to get back to the funny.  Yeah, the stress in the law school has made it more like a pirranha tank than a tudor revival castle.  I'll just be happy when life returns to normal, or whatever the closest thing to normal is for baby lawyers.  Classes are almost over.  We're filling out these things called TCEs (Teacher Course Evaluations).  "How effective was this teacher's teaching style?"  "Evaluate the content of the course."  "Do you think your teacher likes puppies?"  Some teachers use them.  Some throw them out.  Some use them to berate you in class for criticizing their style--no, really.  And then there are study days--the days you realize "Crap--it's really almost over!"  And then there are finals--which never feel as good being over as you had initially hoped.  And then there is May 7.  The end of all things.  The official beginning of 2L summer.  Ahh, the things we live for...

       A Very Special Dinner...  ...What if you could have dinner with just one person in the entire world?  Who would it be?  Would you say Justin Timberlake?  Miss Oklahoma did--and thus began the carnage that was the Trump sponsored "Miss USA" pageant.  Roomie and I waited for the punchline--"No really, I'd like to have dinner with Nelson Mandela/Tony Blair/or even Oprah, for Godsakes" but there it was, hanging out there like a wet piece of laundry.  Also quotable from the pageant, "We bring together stray dogs and stray children."  Courtesy of Miss South Carolina.  And in response to "What is your favorite song?" "Gee, that's, like, the hardest question in the world."  Uh huh.  It's hard to be a beauty queen, ain't it.  Isn't this a freaking scholarship pageant?

       ...Sadly, there is not much to post  Friday: Attend the "Badin Breakdown"--A kareoke contest held on South Quad that included, among other things, a group of guys dressed like cowboys yowling to "Living on a Prayer."  In the words of one of the judges, "Thanks...I actually  used to like that song.  Now?  I'm not so sure."   Friday Night: Play cards with a friend.  And eat Nutella.  Yep, another exciting night in the Bland. Saturday: Wake up at 715am for some still unknown reason.  Decide to go study.  Go to Panera and write from 830 to almost noon.  Decide need fun new spring purse.  Purchase said purse.  Temperature drops by 30 degrees.  Bloody weather. Saturday Night: See The Prince and Me which was, by far, the worst movie I have paid 6 bucks to see in the past year.  It's so sad...Julia Stiles has actual  talent .  Why does she insist on being in stupid teeny bopper movies?  Why is it so bad?  Because they couldn't put the plot together with crazy glue.  And the dialogue is stilted.  Not to mention that it's nowhere close to believable.  I mean, I feel that it is more likely I could run into the talking trees in Return of the King than to have a conversation/situation like that which occured in this movie.  If I were Denmark, I'd be really P.Od.

Then, I might think about it.  Oh no, I remain committed to finishing here at the Evil Building of Doom and figuring it out from there.  What happens after that--who knows.  Maybe I'll get a Masters in Vocal Performance--Kidding, Mom.

       Exultavit Spiritum Meum Pars Secundae...  ...And I may have found my calling.  For many years now, I've been putting it off and not listening.  But I really feel that religious life is where I'm supposed to be.  Some of my fondest memories from childhood were at the day camp I used to attend in the summer that was run by the Sisters of Saint Joseph.  I've been talking to my spiritual director and he put me in touch with the Mother Superior for the Indiana/Michigan Province.  I really think this is where I'm supposed to be and I'm completely at peace with my decision.  I know that in order to live up to my vow of obedience, I will have to cut the snark...but I'm prepared to do that....from now on this website will be dedicated to catechesis.

Therefore, my client deserves to win.  Thank you."  However, my supervisor has informed me that this is not a good plan.  So here I am, on a day of rest, racking my brain for some good old fashioned, Jack McCoy style rhetoric.  Stay tuned for results...

      ...and Diet Dr. Pepper, of course.  So we come to the end of another fun filled week.  Won another trial against a slumlord.  That brings the Good v. Evil total to 5 - 0.  I have made the appropriate corrections to the score board that hangs in my office.  My office was painted white this week--today was my first day back in it.  (I was previously in the kitchen).  I feel like I'm in that part of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory where Willie Wonka has perfected Wonka-vision.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, do yourself a favor and rent the movie.  I had my first sip of Michigan's finest cherry wine.  Yummy.  But not nearly as delicious as the gossip that accompanied it!  Bought and ate Samoa (like the girl scout cookie) ice cream.  Mmmmmm.  Who could have made a more perfect confection?  Coconut, shortbread, chocolate and caramel.  What's the big deal about thin mints?  It's chocolate and mint.  You can get that combination in a variety of forms (Ice cream, Ande's mints, Ande's Mint ice cream).  But Samoas.  Mmmmmm.  I thinK God created them on the 7th day.  Wow, this post is incredibly food oriented.  Must mean I forgot to eat lunch again.  Mer--don't boot me from the fat kid club!

However, I have been informed that the director will make her decision towards the end of the summer.  What does this mean?  The next 12 weeks are one huge freaking audition.  Sweet.  It's like American Idol, only renaissance style.  Well, that and no recording contract that could pay for law school.

       Holy Blogging, Batman...  ...I return from Tennessee to find that everything on Blogger (the host of this site)has changed.  To quote a good friend of mine, "jigga huh?" This week--I start work.  Two client meetings today (Monday) and a hearing on Friday.  It's like being a real lawyer, without the threat of malpractice. I have also gone round one with the landscaper.  $350 to prune hedges?  Edward Frickin' Scissorhands better be showing up.   We have tomotatoes.  And they have funny names like "Meaty Boy" and "Fast Girl."  Why on earth would you name a tomato "Fast Girl?"  I mean, does that mean I just bought a slutty breed of tomato? My car is awesome.  Or at least the cats think so.  I walked out to it yesterday morning to find lots of paw prints, well, all over (including on the sides--I haven't figured that out yet).   Heather, Tyler and I have commandeered the upper corner offices of the clinic.  It's a race to get personal items on the desks, lest they be adversely possessed.  Though since we are really the only three working here, I believe our paranoia may be misplaced....hmmmm.... Looking for intelligent life (you won't find it in the Bend right now)?

Remember...The Basilica Schola Audition? --I know as much as you do--buptkis.  However, the director has had a lot of other stuff to do and will let me know one way or the other.  In either case, I have neither made nor been rejected from the group.   Remember...Law School Finals? --Yeah, they suck.  A lot.  But they are over.  I think I passed Business Law.  I think I am moving on to 3rd year.  Which means one step closer to the (gulp) real world. Remember...Stomach Issues? --Yeah, I have ceased using the sea cucumber defense.  The BF bought me some relaxation (read: theraputic herbal massage) yesterday.  I haven't felt this alive in a week. Remember...Moving Out? --It's kind of like that Billy Joel song.  But more painful.  And to think I have to unpack it all again in three months. Blah. Next Post?  Comin' at Ya from Walton's Mountain...Peace out, gang!

       Props to QC-OHIO who graduates from hell (and all it's levels) today!  Within 12 hours, my happy ass will be sitting in a classroom taking my final exam of my second year of law school.  Which is why I won't be holding up a John 3:16 sign at Meredith's uber-cool graduation.  I don't know how I feel about taking this final.  Right now, I think I'm going to pass.  And that's a good thing (I guess).  Just how will I feel after the final?  I don't know.  When the prof asked me how I was doing, I told him I felt tired--I didn't think it was polite conversation to let him know that his exam has had me hanging my head over the toilet every morning since Monday.  But I told him I figured I'd feel a lot better at 1pm. When the exam was over.  He laughed and told me I might have to wait until 2 or 3.  He is revelling in how difficult this exam is.  Grrrrr.  Which means that tomorrow, I--the Shield Maiden of Rohan that I am--have to go level this thing.  Get your game face on, dude.  We're going in....

I have seen the complete collapse of my nervous system and survived.  Oh, you might think it's hyperbole--but I am officially too damned tired to be clever.  We're talking curl up in a ball and rock back and forth saying, "I wish I was 30! I wish I was 30" breakdown.  Monday, my exams were 3/4 of the way over.  Monday's exam?  Less than brutal--but only slightly.  The paper got turned in.  Last count?  35 pages of canonical goodness.  I'd turn it into an article, if I had more time.  The big bad wicked BA final is friday.  I'd ask you to say a novena for me but their aren't enough days.  So what do I think about Insider trading?  Executive compensation?  Delaware?  Finally, today I got some of my thoughts in order.  Thankfully there are over 48 hours to go.    The Tylenol PM is kicking in--yes, I have to induce sleep lest visions of proxies dance in my head.  Say a prayer (or several) for me--I'll light a candle at the Grotto for you...

      Yesterday, June 22, was the feast day of Thomas More, patron saint of lawyers, statesmen, and politicians.  As Father Don said at Mass last night, "We have a lot of praying to do today."  Thomas More was a distinguished jurist, barrister, political leader, family man, writer and musician.  Okay, according to Erasmus, one of his closest friends, maybe not so much the last item.  But he sang in his chapel choir even after being elevated to the position of Lord Chancellor.  Truly a jack of all trades, Thomas More lost his head for heeding his conscience in 1535 on July 6th.  A seasoned advocate, the transcript from his trial has been preserved to this very day.  While admonishing the court and religious leaders for their grave error in judgment and action in separating from Rome, he closed his statement in court by meekly asking their prayers for him as he would most certainly pray for them in the hope that they would all meet "merrily again in heaven."  Oh that our own profession and nation would mirror his example, courageously identifying error while simultaneously loving those with whom we disagree!   With this thought, each of us--law students and lawyers alike--must renew our minds and hearts and commit ourselves to the pursuit of justice in this world, no matter how grim the outlook, no matter what the cost.  No matter what the perceived status of the legal profession, it remains one the strongest forces for building and maintaining a just society.  As St. Thomas himself said, “You must not abandon the ship in a storm because you cannot control the winds….What you cannot turn to good, you must at least make as little bad as you can.”--Utopia.

And No, I will not bring you back to my house, you middle aged cretin.  What?  You're married?  Ew.  Save yourself the trouble of me embarassing you by shooting you down in front of your friends.  Unless you're hot.  One of the requirements for this "hotness" is that you be under 30.  The other obvious one is that you aren't married.  Think this exchange took place at a seedy bar in downtown South Bend?  Think again.  This took place at Legends, the seedy bar on campus.  Since when do townies invade campus? Other weekend highlights:  urlLink Queens Counsel  from Ohio came to South Bend for a reunion of the Legal Inn of Boogaloo.  Don't get it?  It's a London joke that's really hard to explain.  And it involves llamas.  In any event, after we tore up South Bend on Friday, we moved to St. Joe, Michigan to start our fun times involving beach, ice cream, fudge, and crawfish.  Lots and lots of crawfish.  Sunday we took apart the picnic table, put galvanized nails in and repainted it.  In a nice pinkish red.  We've yet to make Heather's audition video for Survivor.  But the deck looks bitchin' for our Summer Solstice party tonight.  One problem: the  sol  has taken off for greener pastures.  Like Florida.  It has rained non-stop forcing our adventures in grilling (and pagan ritual) indoors.  Thankfully Campari is an all weather drink.

      Those familiar with Monty Python's brilliance will appreciate the next post.  Those who aren't, well, you're really missing out.  Anyway, we've all seen the brilliant masterpiece that is  Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail .  Once you reach a certain level of education you simply must see it or you A)don't get all the graduate student jokes and B) you are simply no fun at cocktail parties.  Well in the Holy Grail, King Arthur and his band of brave knights are attacked by killer rabbits.  Cute fluffy little bunnies that go directly for the jugular.  Enter Nutmeg. I have mentioned several times that we are without adult supervision in the office.  This ties our hands when it comes to actually practicing law as, well, we can't but our supervising attorneys can.  Anyway, my supervisor has a 13 year old daughter who has a rabbit.  Named Nutmeg.  And since my supervisor and his entire family are going to Europe for 2 weeks, they couldn't exactly take the rabbit.  Originally I thought it wouldn't travel well.  Now I know it would probably start an international incident.  So Heather and I agree to take care of the rabbit.  After all, how hard can it be?  It's way lower on the food chain than we are.   This is the rabbit from hell.  It is some sort of demon spawn.  I'm about one step away from grabbing some holy water at the Basilica and sprinkling it on this foul and noxious beast.  Nutmeg needs to eat.  In order to feed her, you have to get to her bowl.  This presents a problem as anytime you place your hand in the cage she hisses, lunges, and attempts to take your hand off with her rather sharp teeth.  We are unclear on how to get her out so we can change the litter.  Heather, who can get just about any animal to fall in love with her, has failed miserably with the rabbit and has the scratch on her chest to prove it.  So the devilish rabbit is staying in its cage.  Not to protect it from the dog and other animals in the household, but to protect us from it.  The next thing you know, it will be spitting pea soup and rotating its head.  Somebody call Father Pearson...or email me a good recipe that involves a bunny in a crock pot.

      ...or dog if you must.  We just adopted a 4 month old kitten who was about to be euthanized.  He's deaf.  Completely and utterly stone deaf.  He remains the only animal in the house not terrified of the vaccuum.  Ironically, his name is Gabriel--the patron saint of communications.  He is in that funny/stupid kitten stage where he can't quite judge the distance from the chair to the ottoman or he gets so excited about his little catnip stuffed chili pepper that he falls off the couch when playing with it.  He's my angel kitty.  Supposedly he will grow to be quite large, though I can't even to begin to imagine him as a grown up cat.  Right now, I can pick him up with one hand, which is convenient when trying to wrangle him away from something he shouldn't be near (like supervising attorney's killer rabbit.  But that's another post.)  Anyway, Gabriel was not the only good natured cat there.  He had a playmate named Michael who was also being adopted.  And then there's Fat Louie.  The cat the size of a hibachi grill that just laid there like a giant overstuffed marshmallow.  He's not jumping on any tables/countertops any time in the next few epochs.  Do what Amanda calls a  mitzvah --it's like your good deed for the year (Hey, I'm a lawyer, I can't afford many more than one).

      ...This is apparently a very LOR day--I guess that's what you get when you work on an appellate brief for 6 hours.  Anyway, the first box set of the Trilogy has come out.  However, much to my disappointment, it contains only the  theatrical  versions and not the  extended  versions.  Pffffft.  I'm not paying $90 for vanilla ice cream when rocky road is coming down the pike.  And with 20 shopping days left on the birthday front I don't expect any of you to, either!

      ...I'm on the same side as the ACLU.  Regular readers will remember that I'm currently working on a case invovling grandparent visitation rights.  In Indiana, where a mom/dad relationship (not just marriage) is dissolved, the grandparents may petition the court to enforce their "rights" to see the children.  As the ACLU has pointed out, this is a huge intrusion of the government into the realm of family decision making.  I'll develop my thoughts a bit more later today...I just find the whole situation interesting.

      ...are really loud.  And I got to experience them first hand thanks to a friend of mine who is not only an organist at the Basilica, but also our resident carillon player.  The Sacred Heart Basilica's carillon (or for us mere mortals "bell tower") is apparently a place of pilgrimage for carillon players.  It is the  urlLink oldest operational carillon  in North America.  It is also full of narrow stairs and ladders that I would not reccomend trying to tour in kitten heeled mules.  It's possible, but not for the faint of heart (or fashion sense). Meanwhile, allow me this sentimental moment of commentary.  We sang the alma mater in four part harmony at Mass yesterday.  I love our alma mater, even if I had it beaten into me on a long bus ride to Kentucky.  But, like everything around here, it's sometimes easy to take it for granted.  My family has been rabid about Notre Dame from pretty much as far back as I can remember, which I find rather extraordinary as no one in my family ever attended the University.  So when my mother emailed me to tell me that she cried during the alma mater, I teared up too.  Thanks Mom, for reminding me how blessed I am to be here.  Even if it involves studying at the Evil Building of Doom.

      As a member of the Midwest Chapter of the Fat-Kid Club (seriously, ask Mer) I was shocked and appalled to find that a  urlLink school in the Boston area  banned cupcakes from children's birthday celebrations because, well, cupcakes are bad for you.  But six year olds need not fear the lack of a sugar high on their special day.  According to the Principal, the birthday celebrant will receive a birthday sash, a special chair cover, a dragon sticker, and a special birthday pencil.  I think that more than makes up for a tastey, icing covered treat.  Okay, maybe not.  What I really think is this is the official death toll for common sense.  If parents are really so concerned about children eating (gasp) 23 cupcakes over the course of a school year, they have several options, not the least of which is a letter home from the administration suggesting healthier treats.  But at the end of the day, is a child eating a cupcake once or twice a month really that bad? And as one of those kids who consistenly got screwed on the birthday lottery front (read: I have a summer birthday) what do you do about me?  Kids with summer birthdays used to bring in treats during the last few weeks of school.  Do the kids with summer birthdays get a special day to sit in a special chair?  I didn't think so.  Give me my damned cupcake, you fascist.

      I'm working on an adoption case right now.  This is the best of all possible worlds--someone loves this child enough to change their legal status.  I think that's grand.  Adoption, of course, makes up a significant part of family law practice.  On the flip side, dealing with and attempting to heal broken families makes up the other significant part.  Children get used as poker chips, upping the ante on the other side.  I should put the disclaimer that not every divorce, death or other family shake up turns vicious, but unfortunately, if you've sought legal relief--which means you've come to see me--it appears that viciousness is the rule, not the exception.   So the latest is Grandparent Visitation.  Indiana--as have several other states--recently passed a statute granting grandparents certain rights to their grandchildren.  Among these is the right to visit with them.  This, on its face, seems like a great idea.  After all the more responsible adults who are involved in a child's life loving it and nurturing it can never be a bad thing.  But what happens when a grandparent v. parent situation is so unfriendly that it has to be brought to court to enforce grandparent's said rights?  Is that good for anyone?  And what if the grandparents don't ever express interest in visiting with their grandkids outside of court ordered hours?  Is that the way this is supposed to work?   The anecdote to this story goes something like this.  We rolled into court ready to put on our awesome case and the judge ordered us back to mediation.  Where a man in sneakers and high water pants came to the door and jumped around the room introducing himself to everyone like a hyperactive puppy.  Grandparents are upset.  Parent is upset.  Everyone expected some resoultion as a result of yesterday and yet we got a truck load of buptkis.  Except a good lecture from the mediator on how evil the legal system is.  Thanks, pal.  I've already paid Notre Dame almost $100K to learn that.

      ...or, "Why Lake Effect Snow isn't the Only Lake Effect Weather Problem."  My first year criminal law professor suggested on the first day of class that we get out and enjoy the weather as much as possible because soon the "perma-cloud" would descend on greater Michianna.  We laughed.  And then we didn't see the sun for 6 months.  And we realized what a curse the perma-cloud was.  And then second year came.  And said criminal law professor escaped to London for a semester and so missed the annual descent of the perma cloud.  But this time the perma cloud brought gifts: snow, ice, and below zero temperatures.  And we froze on our way to class.  But we knew that someday, the sun would return: that indeed, there was life beyond the thunderdome.  So here we sit, the first day of June, and the perma-cloud remains.  It has rained every consecutive day for the last 2 weeks.  Including Memorial Day which started off as a day of barbeque and sun at St. Joe beach and ended with a mad dash to throw everything in the back of the truck and haul ass back to Indiana.  If that's not bad enough, you should see our lawn.  The excess rain has turned it into a jungle.  Curse you, perma-cloud of badness...

I ate entirely too much good food last night at Pockawida's End of Summer Extravaganza.&nbsp; I woke up this morning and felt like an anaconda that had swallowed a cow.&nbsp; I'm not sure what did me in, the chicken, the wine, the cake or the trifle.&nbsp; One thing's for sure--the mini-hiatus from running is officially over.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I throw this general question out there after reading what I consider to be relatively unsubstantiated opinions on some other blogs (go figure).  I was looking at  urlLink Catholic Ragemonkey  --a site run by two parish priests -- one of which was complaining about the poor participation in a mass in his parish.  All other ranting aside, the one nugget I seized upon was the "I am no fan of altar girls."  I've heard and read several other people's similar opinions on the subject, but have never heard any rationale for for holding such an opinion.  As someone who served as an altar girl before it was technically "legal," I found it to be a good spiritual cornerstone in my life, fostering a love and devotion of the Church that I'm not entirely sure I personally would have had if I had not been so intimately involved in the preparation and celebration of the Mass.  That being said, I understand that it is up to the Bishops to make the choice in their individual diocese, though the Vatican has given the green light on the matter.  So what's up with that?  Use the comments link, folks.

      I should start by pointing out that the Catholic liturgy and the pagentry of the American courtroom are not entirely different.  Both come from a long developed line of rules and traditions that are to most members of both communities considered quite sacred.  That being said, for me, sometimes the lines between them blur.  Usually this is in my very active dream life where I've dreamt of courtroom scenes in the Basilica (how Inquisition-esque, I know) as well as liturgies in the courtroom.  But in my more conscious hours I can usually distinguish the two quite readily.  That is until this morning.  We had a routine Motion Hearing downtown.  For those of you non-baby lawyers out there, all that happens is we stand in front of the bench with the opposing party, briefly sketch out our arguments, and the judge renders a decision right there.  The whole thing takes 10 minutes max.  As I grabbed my satchel to leave I caught myself turning with the brief thought of genuflecting to the bench.  Thankfully, I stopped myself before looking like a confused moron.  A paen to the metaphor of Christ as Eternal Judge?  A deep seated desire for communion at the altar?  Or the perils of running on less than one cup of coffee?  I report, you decide.

      I do not frequently sing Senator John McCain's praises.  But allow me to do so now.  In what I fail to see as surprising in any way, the Republican party's misguided effort to amend the Constitution to prohibit the civil unions of homosexuals failed today in the Senate.  McCain called the measure  urlLink "un-republican"  due to its blatant infringement on states' rights.  In a speech on the floor, he argued, "The constitutional amendment we're debating today strikes me as antithetical in every way to the core philosophy of Republicans.  It usurps from the states a fundamental authority they have always possessed and imposes a federal remedy for a problem that most states do not believe confronts them."  While proponents of the measure argue that such an amendment voices the wishes of the people, the people are not only heard on the Hill.  They are heard in Boston, Albany, Austin, Indianapolis, Honolulu and all the other state houses around the country.  If the people feel so strongly about this issue, let it be taken up at the proper level.  Maybe the federal government will have to intervene in one way or another in the future.  But right now, the claim simply isn't ripe.

       I admit it.  I am a Republican.  Far from being a jack booted thug, I am a stiletto wearing, New York Times reading, educated member of the white collar work force.  I get hazed frequently for being a Republican.  And that’s fine with me.  Every time one of my friends gently teases me about my political leanings, I am forced to re-evaluate what it is that I believe and why it is that I believe it.  I don’t typically get upset unless the situation calls for it (such as the time I was called an abortion clinic bomber because I was pro-life).  Therefore, for purposes of this missive, I would hold myself out as being pretty thick skinned about political rhetoric.  I will—more than likely—vote for Bush in the next election.  I do not agree with all of his policies.  But after visiting both his website and John Kerry’s website, I feel that the current president more closely aligns with my personal vision for this country.  That being said, allow me to lay out briefly some key points.  I am against abortion.  I am also against the death-penalty.  I support civil unions so long as they are not used to violate the separation of church and state.  I do not support the Marriage amendment to the US Constitution.  I oppose vouchers.  However, I believe the educational system is better managed by the states than the federal government.  I’ve had enough economics to know that the President cannot create 3 million jobs with the flip of a switch.    I think it’s unfair that a large percentage of the country’s wealth is tied up in a small percentage of the citizenry.  I like Cheney, but I wish Bush would pick another veep.  Who doesn’t smirk as much.  Picking a candidate is difficult, as no candidate will ever match up perfectly to one’s beliefs.  This election cycle, it appears that the Republican ticket matches my political needs--in the above mentioned ways and in others--better than the Democrats.  Here’s my problem.  I cannot stand the cheap shots that both sides take at one another during the election year.  First, to the Democrats: Saints preserve us, we know you think “Dub-ya” is dumb.  The only things I can trace this to are his accent and his unique vocabulary.  As for the accent, shame on you all.  Bill Clinton had a worse “bubba-esque” accent and you all lauded him with the fanfare for the common man.  And I don’t remember anyone—including such acerbic ideologues like Rush Limbaugh—attacking Clinton for being a clueless country bumpkin.  A lecher? Yes.  A political chameleon?  Absolutely.  But never a bumpkin.    {On a personal note, I usually am offended by these jokes.  I know I don’t have a thick Texas accent (I’m not convinced that I have one at all).  But to think that even though I’m more educated than 95% of the people in this country some blue blooded yankee asshole would think I’m stupid because I add a couple extra syllables here and there?  That is simply too much to be borne.}  As for the vocabulary, yes, occasionally he makes up words when he speaks.  Have you tried public speaking in front of thousands plus trying to get the sound bite in for the evening news?  Yeah, it’s  hard , isn’t it.  We’ve all said stupid stuff, myself included.  But if picking up on “Bushisms” is the best you can do to rally your troops (which knowing several of you I know it’s not) that’s really,  really  poor.    Don’t think the Republicans are coming off unscathed.  I watched an interview yesterday morning with Bill Frist (R-TN).  In it, Senator Frist talked about what nice guys Senators Kerry and Edwards are.  He then proceeded to label them as “Oh, probably the fourth and fifth most liberal members of the Senate.”  Huh?  I physically winced when he said this.  I understand that in order to mobilize the Republican base you have to distinguish yourselves from the opposition.  However, this game is stupid.  I’m trying to think of a more articulate word for it and nothing is coming.  It was a ridiculously stupid statement.  And for Godsakes, get it right.  Senator Edwards was not an extremely liberal Democrat.  If we were playing this ridiculous “fourth most liberal” game, I’d place him closer to 20th or 25th.    Second, I already see the seeds of this attack: Senator Edwards is a youngin’.  He is a kid.  He’s not old enough to be president.  My response?  Bite me .  Even though I probably won’t vote for him, good on him for working hard (even if he  was  a personal injury lawyer) and getting to the apex of his career sooner than most people.  The Constitution sets out that a 35 year old could be president.  Edwards is what, 51?  That’s just short of old in my book (just kidding Mom).  But seriously, stop making it sound like he’s going to be throwing keggers and toga parties at the vice presidential mansion.  The guy knows what the hell he’s doing, otherwise he wouldn’t have been selected as the vice presidential nominee.  In closing, I’d offer this.  Keep it clean, folks.  Let’s talk about the real issues that are out there facing the average American voter instead of playing this happy game of smoke, mirrors, and clever sound bites.  Only you can change the American public's view of the electoral process.  Now's as good a time as any to take the high road.

      ...may be in order for my cat.  You see, Max, our two year old coon mutt, came out of the closet this weekend.  How he got into the closet remains a bit of a mystery.  Sometime on Saturday, Max went missing.  This isn't terribly unusual as he has an eerie 6th sense for discerning when a window or door opens in the house and proceeding to bolt through it.  Morning came, evening followed.  And by Sunday night, we had not seen Max at all.  Heather began to become worried.  He may go tomcatting about (as best as he can, since he is fixed) but he always returns to the house to eat.  Sully his paws by eating a bird?  No way. Jimmy Cat will do that.  Max fully enjoys his status as a semi-house cat.  Monday morning I was awakened at 6am by a rather loud cat meow.  Frustrated that I had been awakened so early on a day off, I threw on my bathrobe and proceeded down the stairs to let the cat in.  Only the cat wasn't there.  Heather had a similar experience.  She kept hearing Max when she was in her bedroom, but he was never at the door.  Sometime around lunch, she was cleaning and opened the closet door.  Out popped the cat, disheveled and irritated, but no worse for the wear.  So insert your own inappropriate joke here.  We all have.

      ...okay, only one martini.  But now I'm sleepy.  And there are still 3 hours to go in the work day.  What's a girl to do?  In my case, I think it means curling up with the HUD Housing Program's Guide to Tenant's Rights and meditating on how badly public housing manages to screw over the unfortunate in society.  Good on me. In other news, maybe the boys at Christus Victor or our source in the USCCB can help out with this--what exactly is the ettiquette for greeting a cardinal?  A hungarian one no less?  I will be cantoring a Mass for this man next week and sadly--far from a sense of gratitude--my first thought was, "Holy cripes, do I have to kiss his ring?"  Hopefully for this Mass our favorite organist will give me all of the  correct  music ahead of time.

      ...I just play one in court."  I think this might be the appropriate time to let all gentle readers know that I do not, in fact, have a license to practice law.  Therefore, I cannot, according to the legal canon of ethics (yes, we really do have a canon of ethics) give legal advice to friends and family.  Sooooo, calling up with the salutation "We need some legal advice" or asking me to write a will for you is probably not a good idea.  In addition to potentially getting me disbarred before I'm even "barred" you will get crappy legal advice.  Period.  Hey, I'm not on  law review , y'all.

      So those of you have visited me at the Clinic have also probably seen the bookstore across the street.  The bookstore that we can't figure out how exactly it stays in business because no one ever goes in or out.  The bookstore that is constantly referred to (and only half jokingly) as a "drug front."  We have met the owner.  He came over to the Clinic this afternoon to drop off some law books and invite us to come in and peruse his goods.  He also looks suspiciously like  urlLink this guy .  All we are is dust in the wind, dude.

      ...at least that's the  urlLink story  in Florida where a man held his attorney hostage and demanded that the judge in his case resign.  Nota Bene : It's not just Florida. A man in our neighboring state of Illinois was just accused of plotting to blow up a  urlLink courthouse . So what is it about this job that I love? Somedays (today included) I'm simply not sure. The prospect of sitting behind a desk for 10 hours a day has never appealed to me. Especially when I have nothing to do for those 10 hours. Like today. (Hears near silent ticking of the clock). No seriously, y'all. I have a real work ethic. It just doesn't kick in when there's no  work . I've finished my research projects, my transfer memos and my filing. I think that means it's time for a coffee break...

      Hi. I understand that in your new autobiography you talk about wanting to do away with the IRS. All of the IRS. While I cannot help but hide my unadulterated glee at such an idea, I have a simple request. Is there anyway you could abolish the IRS before, oh, August 23rd of this year? You have the Congressional phone book--it's time to start making some phone calls. You mentioned that it might be difficult to push Congress to siding with you. I can't imagine why. Don't your friends on the hill understand that the less money that goes to the IRS, the more money is available for campaign contributions? This is the time to capitalize on a golden campaign idea. Why August 23rd? Mr. Speaker, I'm glad you asked. You see, here at Notre Dame Law School, they educate a "Different Kind of Lawyer." And apparently that "Different Kind of Lawyer" knows a lot about tax law. So much so that we have a mandatory class in tax law. Which starts on August 23rd. Now, I don't think the Dean and her friends want our knowledge to be obsolete, and I'm sure they don't want to take my tuition money for a class that will be worthless in, say five years. So you can see my dilemma. What? Mr. Speaker, I can't believe you would ask such a question. This is not a self-interested campaign by any stretch. I love tax law. I think it's a beautiful thing. I'm glad that I get to spend 4 credit hours of my precious legal education and countless hours learning the intricate curves of the US Tax Code. I'm merely speaking on behalf of my fellow students. I kindly thank you for your time and attention in this matter.
