      Wow!  Welcome to my new site. I was searching some info and ran across this page. Life has no accidents so of course, I signed up. I have been thinking that it would be a good idea to log my success with my MLM Home Biz anyway. This is such a great way to do just that.   I will stop by and let you know how things are progressing when time allows. I work part time as a school bus driver and also in an Insurance office (very part time). These two jobs give me the ability to work my mlm biz. I have been able to quit my other job driving for Red Cross on wknds and stay at home. What a treat that has been.  I was given a gift of my first dog ever last July 1st 2003. I now have a new baby girl named Daisy, a toy yorkie of 4.2 pounds. She is such a cute little thing. You can view us on my  urlLink Home Page .  My 19 yr old son is moving out in July, into a Frat house. Oh yeah! I'm glad that he is going back to school and so proud of him for getting his Real Estate License here in Southern CA. He has one college year under his belt and took off a year in order to get his life together enough to support himself while finishing school. Yippee... I am so proud!   He threatened to move out when I got my dog, he is still here almost a year later? I find that humorous. :)    I will miss him but Daisy will help to comfort me in my new journey. She is such a sweet thing and doesn't ever want money or car keys. I can hardly wait till she gets this pooping and peeing thing down...  I'm doing the paper training. This is the only system she has respected enough to even attempt without a huge mess.  :)  I have a wonderful little  urlLink Yorkie Site . Join us.  Well, enough for now. I will tell you much more about me next time. I will focus on what it is I'm doing here in the MLM world.   Take care of yourself.     -Diane  :)

      We left off where the hormones were not helping my mood swings.&nbsp;Stress was taking over everything in my life.&nbsp;There was a ton of stuff going on and it was out of control. I had&nbsp;demanded blood work&nbsp;and&nbsp;they&nbsp;increased my dosage of hormones.&nbsp;I was hanging on&nbsp;for the last couple of years, spinning my wheels and getting no where. Working my butt off and not being able to pay the bills. Living for a purpose of survival only. What a way to go, day after day...   Here I am, looking at back surgery at some point, a bad knee, insurance up the wazoo and not making enough to live on still... What to do? My doctor could tell that the hormones were not&nbsp;working really well and put me on an antidepressant in Feb. of 2002. Wow, no wonder I was&nbsp;not able to control anything. Well, this helped a bit but I was&nbsp;still not myself... I was so low emotionally, maybe this was my life now? These vitamins did not seem to making a lot of difference either, except I was getting really tired of all these pills. I'm not much&nbsp;of a pill person anyway. I was very careful to pick the smallest pills possible!&nbsp;&nbsp;I was looking for any kind of help.   I was also given a computer for Christmas and was learning how to surf on the web. I was joining e-mail magazines and daring to go into chat rooms and hang out. This was my new cheap entertainment. I could not believe that I had something like this in my house that could reach around the whole world. My Uncle would have loved this. He was into CB radios back in the day when they tried to see how far they could reach to speak with someone. My Grandma would have loved it just for the solitaire! Anyway, I wanted to see if I could find a way to earn some money on this thing. I signed up for contests and work on line info. Boy did that start to fill up my empty mailbox. I was getting e-mail from everywhere. I soon found out that people were selling my name to folks that had biz opportunities and I was being put into auto responders. I had a lot to learn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :)   I had been careful to try and contact people before signing up with anything. I didn't even get thru to some people. Scary! I got totally burned by a catalog for electronics gig. I could not even return the catalog. They were not there anymore! Well, this could be harder than I thought. I found a company that had liquid nutritional products that looked really good. They were 20 minutes away from my house! Guess what? I shut everything down and drove down to the Corp. Office. As I'm driving around the corner of the block, I had visions of there not being a building. There it was, Life Force International. People were actually in the office! I spoke the the lady at the desk who was very helpful. She gave me some brochures and explained everything. There was a lot of movement going on because everyone was getting ready to go to Florida for the Big Life force Intl Convention that weekend. I went home, got online and ordered my Cornerstone Package in August of 2002. This is the beginning of my LFI Home Business and better health!   I tried all the different products in only 3 months. I got on training calls and just listened. I was a very quiet observer for a while. I could really feel a difference with this stuff. I found my base products and new that I wanted to be on these products for the rest of my life in only 4 months! I was feeling so much better! My normal mood was coming back. I was not reacting so negatively to everything all the time. I was still totally stressed but not as emotional about things. It was really amazing!!! I was starting to smile and be a bit happy again. Some days, I actually&nbsp;wondered what I was on? These products have done what none of the medication could. I decided to go into business with this company because of these incredible products. This is the beginning of my MLM carrier. What a road it would be. I had no idea for the ride I was about to take....

      Okay, let's get this party started! It's time to start from the beginning. I can't think of any other way then to give you some background of where I was in life and what was going on.  I did something that started a chain of events in October of 1997. I walked off a job! I still cannot believe I did this. I am a single mother who has always worked my ass off and this was right before the Holidays! I had had enough and could not walk into that job again. It was such a difficult decision to make. I had to save my sanity! I'd been in accounting for 7 years and was still making less than I needed to live on and putting up with office politics like you cannot believe! This was a family owned and operated business and things went down hill fast when they hired an ex girlfriend of their son, who also worked there. Need I say more. I could not work with her anymore. I heard she quit the next week but it was already too late for me.  I spent a week in shock and tears. Then went through the paper and put in applications for anything. I sat down and searched my head for what I really wanted to do. I had done this for accounting too but that had gone its course...  Finally I came up with working around kids. I had run my own home day care while in Idaho putting myself through accounting classes. This was my most favorite and fun job. The other thing I love to do, is drive. I kept coming up with a school bus driver because of the hours. I could stay home on weekends and be with my son on Holidays. That would be perfect. I called DMV and spoke to a wonderful lady who recommended Laidlaw Transportation for the course. I called them and made the appointment.  I went for my appointment and signed up for the course and on the same day, went for an interview and test for a job. I got accepted for both in perfect time. The Laidlaw course would be during the day so I signed up for nights at my new job as a paging company operator. It was a low paying job that fit perfectly with my day course (with no pay or fee) for driving a school bus. The course would take 3 to 4 months. Yikes! I put in some long hours and my 13 year old son would have to stay home alone at night during this time. I had 3 neighbors that I got along with very well in the same apartment building for him to go to in case of emergency. It was a very difficult time for us both. It was only for a few months and my options were very limited. I felt lucky to have things work out so perfectly in their timing.  I soon became a school bus driver and was hired on with a closer school district and worked my night job on the weekends. Things were looking up. The school district was paying me fairly well. I was a sub driver for over a year, which meant we did not get paid for those winter, spring or summer breaks. The pay was still better than anything else I had done. My good credit was saving my butt here. I was racking up the cards. This was the year my son didn't have a Christmas. That was heart breaking but things were looking up, right?  In 1998 I was hired on as a bus driver. This meant I had medical insurance again and got paid vacation and sick days! Yeah! I was also diagnosed with early menopause. What, at 38 years old, me with early menopause? It was true. My doctor wanted me to take vitamins to help with the symptoms. Okay. This is when I became vitamin queen. I can tell you that I had a lazy suzanne in my cabinet full of vitamins. I was taking multiple vitamins and all kinds of others such as C, iron, calcium, Q enzymes, folic acid and E to name a few. I was getting more and more stressed.  In 1999, I had a bus run from hell. It's funny how the kids normally do what the parents allow them to. You would be amazed at how many parents don't think I should be able to move their child's seat on the bus for misbehaving. I wish parents would come and ride the bus their child takes to school and meet the driver. That would definitely give the parent an idea of what 50 to 80 kids on one vehicle, with only 1 driver in charge, is like. While I'm on my soap box, please stop doing anything you can as a driver to get in front of a school bus. We will get out of your way as soon as we can. We can only go as fast as the bus and the speed limit allow. Pretend we have music on our vehicles like the ice cream trucks. Y'all seem to slow down for them? Maybe pretend that we have your child aboard. Maybe that would help those drivers to slow down and give us some room. We are a vehicle over 10,000 pounds and cannot stop on a dime. Okay, enough about that.  So in 1999, I had a tough bus run, was still not making enough to live on, and was going through early menopause. I remember being very short with my son. I thought it was because of the rude kids on my bus. I was not going to put up with anything from my kid after a day of obscenities from them. Little did I know that the low tolerance for other drivers was getting bad too. If one more person had pulled in front of me and stopped, I was just going to scream. I knew that something was not right. I went to the doctors and they put me on hormones. That should do the trick. These were supposed to make me feel much better!  I was having back pain also and my doctor sent me to a specialist. She was shocked at my curved spine. I had worn a back brace all through Middle School because of my scoliosis. I had that taken care of, I thought. The back doctor told me that I was past the point of needing surgery and would probably be looking at complete spinal fusion within the next year or two. He wanted me to set up an appointment in a year to do another check up. Wow!  That sent me into a tail spin. I did not have insurance for anything like that. If I was unable to work, what would I do? My son could be alone. I was horrified. My grandfather had died and left me some money during this time. I paid off enough credit cards to qualify for a manufactured home in a trailer park. That was as good as I was going to get with my credit card amounts. I thank God for my grandfathers money. It saved my sanity for the next year and helped to get me into a nice home. I purchased a house in a park and got insurance on everything I could. I felt like my son would be taken care of whatever happened to me. I was still not making enough to do what I needed to do. The early menopause might be because of stress and I know my mom went through it very early too. This explained a lot! I remember how she was when I was in Middle School...  The hormones were not helping my mood troubles. There were a lot of issues on the table at home and work. Nothing was going well. I was crying at the drop of a hat. Stress was taking over my life. My poor son put up with a lot during this time. He had no where to run. I could not stop the words coming out of my mouth. It was an awful time for me. I remember walking into the medical center where my doctor was and ordered that they do blood work (without an appointment) and schedule an exam to evaluate the findings. They did and increased my dosage of hormones. My mind was just not working right and I knew it.  I struggled to survive all this for a couple of years. This is a good area to take a break. Imagine a life of spinning your wheels and getting no where. Working your butt off and not being able to pay the bills. Living for a purpose of survival only. What a way to go, day after day...

      On the first day, God created the dog. God said, "Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past. I will give you a life span of 20 years. "The dog said, "That's too long to be barking. Give me 10 years and I'll give you back the other 10." So God agreed.   On the second day, God created the monkey. God said, "Entertain people, do monkey tricks, make them laugh. I'll give you a 20-year life span." The monkey said, "How boring. Monkey tricks for 20 years? I don't think so. Dog gave you back 10, so that's what I'll do too, okay?" And God agreed.   On the third day, God created the cow. God said, "You must go to the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer. I will give you a life span of 60 years." The cow said, "That's kind of a tough life. You want me to live for 60 years? Let me have 20 and I'll give back the other 40." And God agreed again.   On the fourth day, God created man. God said, "Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. I'll give you 20 years." Man said, "What? Only 20 years? Tell you what, I'll take my 20 and 40 the cow gave back and 10 the monkey gave back and 10 the dog gave back. That makes 80, okay?" "Okay," said God, "You've got a deal."   So that's why the first 20 years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves. For the next 40 years, we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next 10 years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grand children. And for the last 10 years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.    ________________________________________

      A man was suffering from a stomach ache, so he told his wife who suggested he try the tablets the Doctor had given her for a similar pain. After taking his wife's tablets for a week, the pain disappeared but he developed two rather tender lumps, one behind each ear.   He went to his doctor, showed him the lumps, and explained what had happened. Where by the Doctor called him all the fools under the sun, saying, "You bloody idiot! I was treating your wife for a fallen uterus; God knows how I'm going to get your balls back down!"    ________________________________________

      Submitted by Sarah Evans of  urlLink The Best Veg Web Site    For those of you who have lived in Texas, you know how true this is. They actually have a Chili Cook-off about the time Halloween comes around.&nbsp; It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the San Antonio City park.   The notes are from an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting from Springfield, IL.&nbsp; &nbsp;Frank: "Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off.&nbsp;The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy and&nbsp;besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting so I accepted". Here are the scorecards from the advent: (Frank is Judge #3)   CHILI # 1 EDDIE'S MANIAC MONSTER CHILI...  Judge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.  Judge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.  Judge # 3 -- (Frank) Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.   CHILI # 2 AUSTIN'S AFTERBURNER CHILI...  Judge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang.  Judge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.  Judge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children.&nbsp; I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.   CHILI # 3 RONNY'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI...  Judge # 1 -- Excellent fire house chili. Great kick. Needs more beans.  Judge # 2 -- A bean less chili, a bit salty, good use of peppers.  Judge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all of the beer...   CHILI # 4 DAVE'S BLACK MAGIC...  Judge # 1 -- Black bean chili with almost no spice.&nbsp; Disappointing.  Judge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.  Judge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the barmaid,was standing behind me with fresh refills. That 300lb woman is starting to look HOT...just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili anaphrodisiac?   CHILI # 5 LISA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER...  Judge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.  Judge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.  Judge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks.   CHILI # 6 PAM'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY...  Judge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers.  Judge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb.  Judge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit on myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone.   CHILI # 7 CARLA'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI...  Judge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.  Judge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can ofchili peppers at the last moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **I should take note that I am worried about Judge # 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.  Judge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match myshirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing it's too painful. Screw it; I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.   CHILI # 8 KAREN'S TOE NAIL CURLING CHILI...  Judge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.  Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor feller, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?    ________________________________________

      One Sunday morning, the pastor noticed little Alex was staring up at the large plaque that hung in the foyer of the church. The plaque was covered with names, and small American flags were mounted on either side of it. The seven-year old had been staring at the plaque for some time, so the pastor walked up, stood beside the boy, and said quietly, "Good mornin Alex." "Good morning pastor," replied the young man, still focused on the plaque. "Father McGhee, what is this?" Alex asked. "Well, son, it's a memorial to all the young men and women who died in the service." Soberly, they stood together, staring at the large plaque. Little Alex's voice was barely audible when he asked, "Which service, the 9:00 or the 11:00?    ________________________________________

      After years of married life, a man finds he is unable to perform.  He goes to his doctor, and his doctor tries a few things, but nothing works. Finally the doctor says to him "This is all in your mind." And refers him to a psychiatrist.   After a few visits, the psychiatrist confesses, "I am at a loss as to how you could possibly be cured." Finally the psychiatrist refers him to a witch doctor.   The witch doctor says, "I can cure this." He throws some powder on a flame, and there is a flash with billowing blue smoke. The witch doctor says "This is powerful healing, but you can only use it once a year! All you have to do is say `1-2-3` and it shall rise for as long as you wish!"   The guy then asks the witch doctor "What happens when it's over?"   The witch doctor says "All you or your partner has to say is  "1-2-3-4" and it will go down. But be warned; it will not work  again for another year!"   The guy goes home and that night he is ready to surprise his wife  with the good news. So, he is lying in bed with her and says  "1-2-3", and suddenly he gets an erection.   His wife turns over and says "What did you say "1-2-3" for?"    ________________________________________

      Children were lined up in the cafeteria of a Catholic school for lunch. At the beginning of the line there was a large pile of apples. A nun had written a note, "Take only one, God is watching."   At the end of the line there was a large stack of chocolate chip cookies. A boy wrote a note and left it on the cookies that said "Take all you want, God is watching the apples."    ________________________________________

      An Irish priest is driving down to New York and gets stopped for speeding in Connecticut. The state trooper smells alcohol on the priests breath and then sees an empty wine bottle on the floor of the car. He says, "Sir, have you been drinking?"   "Just water," says the priest.   The trooper says, "Then why do I smell wine?"   The priest looks at the bottle and says, "Good Lord! He's done it again!"    ________________________________________

      An Irishman had been drinking at a pub all night. The bartender finally said that the bar was closing. So the Irishman stood up to leave and fell flat on his face. He tried to stand one more time; same result. He figured he would crawl outside and get some fresh air and maybe that would sober him up. Once outside, he stood up and fell on his face again. So he decided to crawl the four blocks home. When he arrived at the door he stood up and fell flat on his face. He crawled through the door and into his bedroom. When he reached his bed he tried one more time to stand up. This time he managed to pull himself upright, but he quickly fell right into the bed and was sound asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.   He was awakened the next morning to his wife standing over him, shouting, "SO YOU'VE BEEN OUT DRINKING AGAIN!"   Putting on an innocent look, and intent on bluffing it out he said, "What makes you say that?"   "The pub just called; you left your wheelchair there again."    ________________________________________

      A little girl was talking to her teacher about whales. The teacher said it was physically impossible for a whale to swallow a human because even though it was a very large mammal, its throat was very small.   The little girl stated that Jonah was swallowed by a whale. Irritated, the teacher reiterated that a whale could not swallow a human; it was physically impossible. The little girl said, "When I get to heaven, I will ask Jonah".   The teacher asked, "What if Jonah went to hell?"  The little girl replied, "Then you ask him."     AND     A little boy got on the bus, sat next to a man reading a book and noticed he had his collar on backwards. The little boy asked why he wore his collar that way. The man, who was a priest, said, " I am a Father." The little boy replied "My Daddy doesn't wear his collar like that." The priest looked up from his book and answered "I am the Father of many." The boy said, "My Dad has 4 boys, 4 girls and two grandchildren and he doesn't wear his collar that way."   The priest getting impatient said, "I am the Father of hundreds," and went back to reading his book.   The little boy sat quietly ... but on leaving the bus he leaned over and said, "Well, maybe you should wear your pants backwards instead of your collar."    ________________________________________

      Four Catholic ladies are having coffee together,  discussing how important their children are.   The first one tells her friends, "my son is a priest.  When he walks into a room, everyone calls him "Father.'"   The second Catholic woman chirps, "Well, my son is a Bishop.  Whenever he walks into a room, people say, 'Your Grace'."   The third Catholic woman says smugly, "well, not to put you down, but my son is a cardinal. Whenever he walks into a room, people say, 'Your Eminence'."   The fourth Catholic woman sips her coffee in silence. The first three women give her this subtle "Well...?" She replies, "My son is a gorgeous, 6'2", hard-bodied, well-hung, male stripper.  Whenever he walks into a room, people say, My God......"    ________________________________________

      1. People who point at their wrist while asking for the time. I know where my watch is buddy, where the hell is yours? Do I point at my crotch when I ask where the bathroom is?   2. The Pillsbury doughboy is way too happy considering he has no  dick.   3. People who are willing to get off their ass to search the entire room for the TV remote because they refuse to walk to the TV and change the channel manually.   4. When people say, "Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it  too." What good is a damn cake you can't eat?   5. When people say "It's always in the last place you look". Of  course it is. Why the hell would you keep looking after you've found it? Do people do this? Who and where are they?   6. When people say, while watching a movie "Did you see that?" No  idiot, I paid $7.50 to come to the theatre and stare at the fricken ceiling up there.   7. The radio ad "Hi, I'm Jeff Healey from the Jeff Healey Band. Don't drink and drive. I don't". Well, I hope you don't drive sober either, Mr. Healey. You're blind for God's sake!   8. People who ask "Can I ask you a question?" Didn't really give me a choice, did ya there buddy?   9. When something is "new and improved", which is it? If it's new,  then there has never been anything before it. If it's an improvement, then there must have been something before it.   10. When a cop pulls you over and then asks if you know how fast you were going? You should know asshole, you pulled me over!    ________________________________________

      Your idea of a traffic jam is ten cars waiting to pass a tractor on the highway.   "Vacation" means going to Boise.   You measure distance in hours.   You know several people who have hit a deer.   School classes were canceled because of cold.   School classes were canceled because of heat.   You've ridden the school bus for more than an hour each way.   You've had to switch from "heat" to "A/C" in the same day.   You think ethanol makes your truck "run a lot better."   You know what's knee-high by the Fourth of July.   Stores don't have bags; they have sacks.   You see people wear bib overalls at funerals.   You know how to pronounce the name of the town of Buhl, Weippe or Kooskia.   All the festivals across the state are named after a fruit, vegetable, grain, or animal.   You install security lights on your house and garage and leave both unlocked.   You think of the major four food groups as beef, pork, beer, and Jell-O salad with marshmallows.   You carry jumper cables in your car.   You know what "cow tipping" and "snipe hunting" are.   You only own 3 spices: salt, pepper, and ketchup.   You design your kid's Halloween costume to fit over a snowsuit.   Driving is better in the winter because the potholes are filled  with snow and ice.   You think everyone from a bigger city has an accent.   The local paper covers national and international headlines on one page but requires 6 pages for cattle prices and sports.   You think that opening day of deer season is a national holiday.   You know which leaves make good toilet paper.   You find -20 degrees F "a little chilly."   You know all 4 seasons: Almost Winter, winter, Still Winter, and  construction.   You turn on your blinker after you start a turn.   You think your town is big if it has a traffic light.   You know Nampa, Caldwell, Meridian, Eagle and Middleton are NOT  synonymous with Boise.   You know gravel road shortcuts by heart.   At least three of your best friends work for the Forest Service.   You have a $100,000 income, and still wear cowboy clothes to formals.   You drive a 4-wheeler around town.   You don't even greet people who voted for Al Gore.   Elk City is an actual town and not a mere expression of the Idaho Wilderness Land.   Your chainsaw has a name.   The only time your dog stops barking is when it dies.   "Truck", "Pickup" and "Rig" have entirely different meanings and you bitch at people who use them synonymously.   You know very well what Rocky Mountain Oysters are.   Your town has about 3 bars per 100 people.   You have to travel over 20 miles to get groceries.   You have to stay all week in the town of your high school because its too far from home.   Coyotes are the main source of gang-related crime.   Your mayor, instead of driving a Mercedes drives an F350 Ford.   The best restaurant in town doesn't allow people under 21, even for breakfast.   You get fake ID's to drive.   You log for sport.   At the sight of an FBI symbol you tremble.   Contrast to what non-Idahoans think, you don't know a dang thing about the potato industry.   You can stand the smell of cow manure, Caldwell, Lewiston, and smoke.   You've never hunted Rattlesnakes or Porcupines.   People wonder what the color of your pickup would be without the dirt and bumper stickers.   Cars are the official rig of sissies.   Your rig has only one radio station. It plays only country, but you don't care.   Your county coroner has to campaign a conservative political platform to get elected.   You actually get these jokes and forward them to your Idaho friends.   (This really made me laugh and yes, I'm from Idaho, born &amp; raised.)   ________________________________________

      For years and years they told me,  Be careful of your breasts,  Don't ever squeeze or bruise them,  And give them monthly tests.   So I heeded all their warnings,  And protected them by law.  Guarded them very carefully,  And I always wore my bra.   After 30 years of astute care,  My Doctor found a lump.  She ordered up a mammogram,  To look inside that bump.   "Stand up very close," she said,  As she got my boob in line.  "And, tell me when it hurts," she said.  "Ah yes! There, that's fine."   She stepped upon a peddle.  I could not believe my eyes!  A plastic plate pressed down and down,  My boob was in a vice!   My skin was stretched and stretched,  From way up under my chin.  My poor boob was being squashed,  To Swedish pancake thin.   Excruciating pain I felt,  Within it's vice-like grip.  A prisoner in this vicious thing,  My poor defenseless tits!   "Take a deep breath," she said to me,  Who does she think she's kidding?  My chest is mashed in her machine,  And woozy I am getting.   "There, that was good," I heard her say  As the room was slowly swaying.  "Now let's have a go at the other one."  "Lord have mercy," I was praying.   It squeezed me from up and down,  It squeezed me from both sides,  I'll bet she's never had this done,  Not to her tender little hide!   If I had no problem when I came in,  I surely have one now.  If there had been a cyst in there,  It would have popped, Ker-pow!   This machine was designed by man,  Of this I have no doubt,  I'd like to stick his balls in there.  And see how they come out!    ________________________________________

      While trying to escape through Pakistan, Osama Bin Laden found a bottle on a beach and picked it up. Suddenly, a female genie rose from the bottle and with a smile said "Master, may I grant you one wish?"   "You ignorant unworthy daughter-of-a-dog! Don't you know who I am? I don't need any common woman giving me anything" barked Bin Laden.   The shocked genie said, "Please, I must grant you a wish or I will be returned to that bottle forever."   Osama thought a moment. Then grumbled about the impertinence of the woman and said "Very well, I want to awaken with three white women in my bed in the morning, so just do it and be off with you!"   The annoyed genie said, "So be it!" and disappeared. The next morning Bin Laden woke up in bed with Lorena Bobbitt, Tanya Harding, and Hillary Clinton.   His penis was gone, his knee was broken, and he had no health insurance.   God is good.   ________________________________________

      A man suffered a serious heart attack and had an open heart bypass  surgery. He awakened from the surgery to find himself in the care of nuns at a Catholic Hospital.   As he was recovering, a nun asked him questions regarding how he was going to pay for his treatment. She asked if he had health insurance.   He replied, in a raspy voice, "No health insurance."   The nun asked if he had money in the bank.   He replied, "No money in the bank."   The nun asked, "Do you have a relative who could help you?"   He said, "I only have a spinster sister, who is a nun."   The nun became agitated and announced loudly, "Nuns are not  spinsters! Nuns are married to God."   The patient replied, "Send the bill to my brother-in-law."   _______________________________________

       Snappy Answer #1   A stewardess was stationed at the departure gate to check tickets. As a man approached, she extended her hand for the ticket, and he opened his coat and flashed her. Without missing a beat she said, "Sir, I need to see your ticket, not your stub."    Snappy Answer #2   A lady was picking through the frozen chickens at the supermarket, but couldn't find one big enough for her family. She asked the shelf stacker, "Do these chickens get any bigger?"  He replied, "No , they're dead."    Snappy Answer #3   The policeman got out of his car and the lad who was stopped for speeding rolled down his window.  "I've been waiting for you all day," the policeman said.  The lad replied, "Yeah, well I got here as fast as I could."  When the policeman finally stopped laughing, he sent the lad on his way without a ticket.    Snappy Answer #4   A lorry driver was driving along. A sign comes up that reads "low bridge ahead." Before he knows it the bridge is right ahead of him and he gets stuck under the bridge. Cars are backed up for miles. Finally, a police car comes up. The policeman gets out of his car and walks around to the lorry driver, puts his hands on his hips and says, "Got stuck?"  The lorry driver says, "No mate, I was delivering this bridge and ran out of petrol."    and Finally #5, THE TEACHER Snappy Answer OF THE YEAR   A university lecturer reminds her students of tomorrow's final exam. "Now, I won't tolerate any excuses for you not being here tomorrow. I might consider a nuclear attack or a serious personal injury or illness, or a death in your immediate family but that's it, no other excuses whatsoever!"   A smart-arse bloke in the back of the room raised his hand and asks, "What would you say if tomorrow I said I was suffering from complete and utter sexual exhaustion?" The entire class does its best to stifle their laughter.   When silence is restored, the lecturer smiles sympathetically at the student, shakes her head, and sweetly says, "Well, I suppose you'd have to write the exam with your other hand."    ________________________________________

        Jesus' Dad's Name?    A Sunday school teacher asked her class, "What was Jesus' mother's  name?"  One child answered, "Mary."  The teacher then asked, "Who knows what Jesus' father's name was?"  A little kid said, "Verge."  Confused, the teacher asked, "Where did you get that?"  The kid said, "Well, you know they are always talking about Verge n' Mary.   ***********    KIDS IN CHURCH    3-year-old, Reese:  "Our Father, Who does art in heaven, Harold is His name. Amen."   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A little boy was overheard praying:  "Lord, if you can't make me a better boy, don't worry about it. I'm having a real good time like I am."   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A. Sunday school class was studying the Ten Commandments.  They were ready to discuss the last one.  The teacher asked if anyone could tell her what it was.  Susie raised her hand, stood tall, and quoted,  "Thou shall not take the covers off the neighbor's wife."   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ After the christening of his baby brother in church,  Jason sobbed all the way home in the back seat of the car.  His father asked him three times what was wrong.  Finally, the boy replied,  "That preacher said he wanted us brought up in a  Christian home, and I wanted to stay with you guys."   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I had been teaching my three-year old daughter, Caitlin, the Lord's Prayer for several evenings at bedtime, she would repeat after me the lines from the prayer. Finally, she decided to go solo. I listened with pride as she carefully enunciated each word right up to the end of the prayer:  "Lead us not into temptation," she prayed, "but deliver us some  E-mail."   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  One particular four-year-old prayed, "And forgive us our trash baskets as we forgive those who put trash in our baskets."   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A Sunday school teacher asked her children, as they were on the way to church service, "And why is it necessary to be quiet in church?"  One bright little girl replied, "Because people are sleeping."   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Six-year-old Angie and her four-year-old brother Joel were sitting  together in church.  Joel giggled, sang, and talked out loud.  Finally, his big sister had had enough.  "You're not supposed to talk out loud in church."  "Why? Who's going to stop me?" Joel asked.  Angie pointed to the back of the church and said,  "See those two men standing by the door?  They're hushers."   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  A mother was preparing pancakes for her sons, Kevin, 5 and Ryan 3. The boys began to argue over who would get the first pancake. Their mother saw the opportunity for a moral lesson. "If Jesus were sitting here, He would say, 'Let my brother have the first  pancake, I can wait." Kevin turned to his younger brother and said, "Ryan, you be Jesus!"   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A father was at the beach with his children when the four-year-old son ran up to him, grabbed his hand, and led him to the shore  where a seagull lay dead in the sand. "Daddy, what happened to him?" the son asked. "He died and went to Heaven," the Dad replied. The boy thought a moment and then said, "Did God throw him back down?"   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A wife invited some people to dinner. At the table, she turned to  their six-year-old daughter and said, "Would you like to say the  blessing?"  "I wouldn't know what to say," the girl replied.  "Just say what you hear Mommy say," the wife answered.  The daughter bowed her head and said, "Lord, why on earth did I  invite all these people to dinner?"    ________________________________________

      After starting a new diet, I altered my drive to work  to avoid passing my favorite bakery. I accidentally  drove by the bakery this morning and there in the  window were a host of goodies. I felt this was no  accident, so I prayed, "Lord, it's up to you....if you  want me to have any of those delicious goodies, create  a parking place for me directly in front of the  bakery." And sure enough, He answered my prayer....on  the eighth time around the block, there it was!    ________________________________________

        "WE WOULD RATHER DO BUSINESS WITH 1000   AL QAEDA TERRORISTS THAN WITH A SINGLE AMERICAN"      This sign was prominently displayed in the window of a business in Philadelphia. You are probably outraged at the thought of such an inflammatory statement. One would think that anti-hate groups from all across the country would be marching on this business... And that the National Guard might have to be called to keep the angry crowds back.   But, perhaps in these stressful times one might be tempted to let the proprietors simply make their statement. We are a society which holds Freedom of Speech as perhaps our greatest liberty ...   And after all, it is just a sign.   You may ask what kind of business would dare post such a sign?   Answer: A Funeral Home.  (Who said morticians had no sense of humor?)   You gotta love it!!!    ________________________________________

      I am a senior citizen. During the Clinton Administration,  I had an extremely good and well paying job. I took numerous  vacations and had several vacation homes. Since President  Bush took office, I have watched my entire life change for  the worse. I lost my job. I lost my two sons in that terrible  Iraqi War. I lost my homes. I lost my health insurance. As a  matter of fact, I lost virtually everything and became homeless.  Adding insult to injury, when the authorities found me living  like an animal, instead of helping me, they arrested me.  I will do anything to insure President Bush's defeat in the  next election. I will do anything that Senator Kerry wants to  insure that a Democrat is back in the White House come next year.  Bush has to go. I just thought you and your readers would like  to know how one senior citizen views the Bush Administration.  Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.  Sincerely, Saddam Hussein    ________________________________________

      Why Lawyers should never ask a witness a question if they aren't prepared for the answer:  In a trial, a Southern small town prosecuting attorney called his first witness to the stand a grandmotherly, elderly woman.  He approached her and asked, "Mrs. Jones, do you know me?"  She responded, "Why, yes I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a young boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you never will amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.  The Lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do,he pointed across the room and asked, "Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?  "She again replied, "Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women, one of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.  "The defense attorney almost died. The judge asked both counselors to approach the bench, and in a very quiet voice, said, "If either of you bastards asks that bitch if she knows me, I'll throw your sorry asses in jail for contempt."   ________________________________________

      Everyone thinks we are senile.  An elderly couple who were childhood sweethearts had married and settled down in their old neighborhood and are celebrating their sixtieth wedding anniversary. They walk down the street to their old school. There, they hold hands as they find the old desk they'd shared and where he had carved "I love you, Sally."  On their way back home, a bag of money falls out of an armored car practically at their feet. She quickly picks it up, but they don't know what to do with it so they take it home. There, she counts the money, and it's fifty-thousand dollars. The husband says, "We've got to give it back." She says, "Finders keepers." And she puts the money back in the bag and hides it up in their attic.  The next day, two FBI men are going door-to-door in the neighborhood looking for the money and show up at their home. They say, "Pardon me, but did either of you find any money that fell out of an armored car yesterday?" She says, "No." The husband says, "She's lying. She hid it up in the attic." She says, "Don't believe him, he's getting senile." But the agents sit the man down and begin to question him. One says, "Tell us the story from the beginning." The old man says, "Well, when Sally and I were walking home from school yesterday..." The FBI guy looks at his partner and says, "We're outta here..."   ________________________________________

      Just in case you ever got the two mixed up, this should make things a little bit more clear. . . .  IN PRISON... You spend the majority of your time in an 8X10 cell. AT WORK... You spend the majority of your time in a 6X8 cubicle.  IN PRISON... You get three meals a day. AT WORK... You only get a break for one meal and you have to pay for it.  IN PRISON... You get time off for good behavior. AT WORK... You get more work for good behavior.  IN PRISON... The guard locks and unlocks all the doors for you. AT WORK... You must carry around a security card and open all the doors for yourself.  IN PRISON... You can watch TV and play games. AT WORK... You get fired for watching TV and playing games.  IN PRISON... You get your own toilet. AT WORK... You have to share with some idiot who pees on the seat.  IN PRISON... They allow your family and friends to visit. AT WORK... You can't even speak to your family.  IN PRISON... All expenses are paid by the taxpayer with no work required. AT WORK... You pay all the expenses to go to work and pay taxes from your salary to pay for prisoners.  IN PRISON... You spend most of your life inside bars wanting to get out. AT WORK... You spend most of your time wanting to get out and go inside bars.  IN PRISON... You must deal with sadistic wardens. AT WORK... They are called managers.  So... Why is it again that we work?   ________________________________________

      You know you're living in 2004 when .. 1. You accidentally enter your password on the microwave. 2. You haven't played solitaire with real cards in years. 3. You have a list of 15 phone numbers to reach your family of 3. 4. You e-mail the person who works at the desk next to you. 5. Your reason for not staying in touch with friends and family is that they don't have e-mail addresses. 6. You go home after a long day at work you still answer the phone in a business manner. 7. You make phone calls from home, you accidentally dial "9" to get an outside line. 8. You've sat at the same desk for four years and worked for three different companies. 10. You learn about your redundancy on the 11 o'clock news. 11. Your boss doesn't have the ability to do your job. 12.

Leaving the house without your cell phone, which you didn't have the first 20 or 30 (or 60) years of your life, is now a cause for panic and you turn around to go and get it. 15. You get up in the morning and go online before getting your coffee. 16. You start tilting your head sideways to smile. :) 17. You're reading this and nodding and laughing. 18. Even worse, you know exactly to whom you are going to forward this message. 19. You are too busy to notice there was no #9 on this list. 20.

      There is a merry family gathering with all generations around the table. The little children (naughty little rascals) smuggle a Viagra tablet into Grandpa's drink. After a while, Grandpa excuses himself because he has to go to the bathroom. When he returns, however, his trousers are wet all over.  "What happened, Grandpa?" he is asked by his concerned children.  "Well," he answers, "I had to go to the bathroom. So I took it out, but then I saw that it wasn't mine, so I put it back!"   ________________________________________

      Quote attributed to Chris Rock: "You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, and the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese. The Swiss hold the America's Cup, France is accusing the US of arrogance, Germany doesn't want to go to war, and the three most powerful men in America are named 'Bush,' 'Dick,' and 'Colon.' Need I say more?"   ________________________________________

      A blonde walks into a bank in New York City and asks for the loan officer. She says she's going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000. The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Mercedes Benz SL 500. The car is parked on the street in front of the bank, she has the title and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car collateral for the loan. The Banks president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blond for using a $110,000 Benz as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then proceeds to drive the Benz into the Banks underground garage and parks it there.  Two weeks later, the blonde returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, "Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and found that you are a multi-millionaire. What puzzles us is, why would you bother to borrow $5,000?" The blonde replies....."Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?"  Finally, a smart blonde joke.   ________________________________________

      1. Now that food has replaced sex in my life, I can't even get into my own pants.  2. Marriage changes passion. Suddenly you're in bed with a relative.  3. I saw a woman wearing a sweat shirt with "Guess" on it. So I said Implants?" She hit me.  4. I don't do drugs. I get the same effect just standing up fast.  5. I live in my own little world. But it's OK. They know me here.  6. I got a sweater for Christmas. I really wanted a screamer or a moaner.  7. I don't approve of political jokes. I've seen too many of them get elected.  8. Every time I walk into a singles bar I can hear Mom's wise words: Don't pick that up, you don't know where it's been!"  9. A good friend will come and bail you out of jail...But, a true friend will be sitting next to you saying, "Damn...That was fun!"  10. I signed up for an exercise class and was told to wear loose-fitting clothing. If I HAD any loose-fitting clothing, I wouldn't have signed up in the first place!  11. When I was young we used to go "skinny dipping," now I just "chunky dunk."  12. Don't argue with an idiot; people watching may not be able to tell the difference.  13. Just remember...If the world didn't suck, we'd all fall off.  14. Why is it that our children can't read a Bible in school, but they can in prison?  15. If raising children was going to be easy, it never would have started with something called LABOR!  16. Wouldn't you know it...Brain cells come and brain cells go, but FAT cells live forever.  17. Why do I have to swear on the Bible in court when the Ten Commandments cannot be displayed in a federal building?  18. Bumper sticker: "If you can read this, thank a teacher...And since it's in English, thank a soldier."   ________________________________________

      Recently we have received credible intelligence that there have been seven terrorists working in your office. Fortunately, six of the seven have been apprehended. Bin Sleepin, Bin Loafin, Bin Goofin, Bin Lunchin, Bin Drinkin and Bin Behind-Kissin have all been taken into custody. At this time, no one fitting the description of the seventh cell member, Bin Workin, has been found at your office. We are confident that anyone who looks like he's Bin Workin will be very easy to spot. You are OBVIOUSLY not a suspect at this time.   ________________________________________

      Always keep your words soft and sweet, just in case you have to eat them. Drive carefully. It's not only cars that can be recalled by their maker. Never put both feet in your mouth at the same time, because then you don't have a leg to stand on. The early worm gets eaten by the bird, so sleep late. When everything's coming your way, you're in the wrong lane. A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour. Happiness comes through doors you didn't even know you left open. We could learn a lot from crayons: some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, some have weird names, and all are different colors but they all have to learn to live in the same box. You may be only one person in the world, but you may also be the world to one person.   ________________________________________

      Belfast pub comes Paddy Murphy, looking like he'd just been run over by a train. His arm is in a sling, his nose is broken, his face is cut and bruised and he's walking with a limp. "What happened to you?" asks Sean, the bartender. "Jamie O'Conner and me had a fight," says Paddy. "That little shit, O'Connor," says Sean, "He couldn't do that to you, he must have had something in his hand." "That he did," says Paddy, "a shovel is what he had, and a terrible lickin' he gave me with it." "Well," says Sean, "you should have defended yourself, didn't you have something in your hand?" "That I did," said Paddy... "Mrs.. O'Connor's breast, and a thing of beauty it was, but useless in a fight." ======================================== An Irishman who had a little too much to drink is driving home from the city one night and, of course, his car is weaving violently all over the road. A cop pulls him over. "So," says the cop to the driver, where have ya been?" "Why, I've been to the pub of course," slurs the drunk. "Well," says the cop, "it looks like you've had quite a few to drink this evening." "I did all right," the drunk says with a smile. "Did you know," says the cop, standing straight and folding his arms across his chest, "that a few intersections back, your wife fell out of your car?" "Oh, thank heavens," sighs the drunk. "For a minute there, I thought I'd gone deaf." ======================================== Brenda O'Malley is home making dinner, as usual, when Tim Finnegan arrives at her door. "Brenda, may I come in?" he asks. "I've somethin' to tell ya". "Of course you can come in, you're always welcome, Tim. But where's my husband?" "That's what I'm here to be telling ya, Brenda." There was an accident down at the Guinness brewery..." "Oh, God no!" cries Brenda. "Please don't tell me." "I must, It was terrible, Brenda. He fell into a vat of Guinness Stout and drowned." "Oh my dear Jesus! But you must tell me true, Tim. Did he at least go quickly?" "Well, Brenda... no. In fact, he got out three times to pee." ======================================== Mary Clancy goes up to Father O'Grady after his Sunday morning service, and she's in tears. He says, "So what's bothering you, Mary my dear?" She says, "Oh, Father, I've got terrible news. My husband passed away last night." The priest says, "Oh, Mary, that's terrible. Tell me, Mary, did he have any last requests?" She says, "That he did, Father." The priest says, "What did he ask, Mary? "She says, "He said, 'Please Mary, put down that damn gun...' ======================================== AND THE BEST FOR LAST A drunk staggers into a Catholic Church, enters a confessional booth, sits down but says nothing. The Priest coughs a few times to get his attention, but the drunk continues to sits there. Finally, the Priest pounds three times on the wall. The drunk mumbles, "ain't no use knockin; there's no paper on this side either.   ________________________________________

      Little Johnny attended a horse auction with his father. He watched as his father moved from horse to horse, running his hands up and down the horse's legs, rump, and chest. After a few minutes, Johnny asked, "Dad, why are you doing that?" His father replied, "Because when I'm buying horses, I have to make sure that they are healthy and in good shape before I buy. Johnny, looking worried, said, "Dad, I think the UPS guy wants to buy Mom."   _________________________________________

      A woman was leaving a convenience store with her morning coffee when she noticed a most unusual funeral procession approaching the nearby cemetery. A long black hearse was followed by a second long black hearse about 50 feet behind the first one. Behind the second hearse was a solitary woman walking a pit bull on a leash. Behind her, a short distance back, were about 200 women walking single file.  The woman couldn't stand her curiosity. She respectfully approached the woman walking the dog and said, "I am so sorry for your loss, and I know now is a bad time to disturb you, but I've never seen a funeral like this. Whose funeral is it?" "My husband's."  "What happened to him?" The woman replied, "My dog attacked and killed him."  She inquired further, "Well, who is in the second hearse?" The woman answered, "My mother-in-law. She was trying to help my husband when the dog turned on her."  A poignant and thoughtful moment of silence passed between the two women.  "Can I borrow the dog?"  "Get in line."    _______________________________________    A Woman's Prayer Dear Lord, I pray for: Wisdom,  To understand a man. Love, To forgive him and; Patience, For his moods. Because Lord, if I pray for Strength, I'll just beat him to death.   ________________________________________

      This is hysterical. If it had been presented this way, none of us would have done it!!!!    POSITION  : Mother, Mom, Mama, Mommy or Father, Pop, Dad, Daddy    DESCRIPTION  : Long term, team players needed, for challenging permanent work in an, often chaotic environment. Candidates must possess excellent communication and organizational skills and be willing to work variable hours, which will include evenings and weekends and frequent 24 hour shifts on call. Some overnight travel required, including trips to primitive camping sites on rainy weekends and endless sports tournaments in far away cities. Travel expenses not reimbursed. Extensive courier duties also required.    RESPONSIBILITIES  : The rest of your life, you must be willing to be hated, at least temporarily, until someone needs $5. Must be willing to bite tongue repeatedly. Also, must possess the physical stamina of a pack mule and be able to go from zero to 60 mph in three seconds flat in case, this time, the screams from the backyard are not someone just crying wolf. Must be willing to face stimulating technical challenges, such as small gadget repair, mysteriously sluggish toilets and stuck zippers. Must screen phone calls, maintain calendars and coordinate production of multiple homework projects. Must have ability to plan and organize social gatherings for clients of all ages and mental outlook's. Must be willing to be indispensable one minute, an embarrassment the next. Must handle assembly and product safety testing of a half million cheap, plastic toys, and battery operated devices. Must always hope for the best but be prepared for the worst. Must assume final, complete accountability for the quality of the end product. Responsibilities also include floor maintenance and janitorial work throughout the facility.    POSSIBILITY FOR ADVANCEMENT &PROMOTION  : Virtually none. Your job is to remain in the same position for years, without complaining, constantly retraining and updating your skills, so that those in your charge can ultimately surpass you.    PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE  : None required unfortunately. On-the-job training offered on a continually exhausting basis.    WAGES AND COMPENSATION  :Get this! You pay them! Offering frequent raises and bonuses. A balloon payment is due when they turn 18 because of the assumption that college will help them become financially independent. When you die, you give them whatever is left. The oddest thing about this reverse-salary scheme is that you actually enjoy it and then wish you could only do more.    BENEFITS  : While no health or dental insurance, no pension, no tuition reimbursement, no paid holidays and no stock options are offered; this job supplies limitless opportunities for personal growth and free hugs for life if you play your cards right.   ________________________________________

      An honest man is being tailgated by a stressed-out woman on a busy boulevard. Suddenly, the light turns yellow in front of him. He does the honest thing, and stops at the crosswalk, even though he could have beaten the red light by accelerating through the intersection. The tailgating woman hits the roof, and the horn, screaming in frustration as she misses her chance to get through the intersection with him. As she is still in mid-rant, she hears a tap on her window and looks up into the face of a very serious police officer. The officer orders her to exit her car with her hands up. He takes her to the police station where she is searched, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed in a cell.  After a couple of hours, a police officer approaches the cell and opens the door. She is escorted back to the booking desk where the arresting officer is waiting with her personal effects. He says, "I'm very sorry for this mistake. You see, I pulled up behind your car while you were blowing your horn, flipping the guy off in front of you and cussing a blue streak at him. I noticed the 'Choose Life' license plate holder, the 'What Would Jesus Do' bumper sticker, the 'Follow Me to Sunday School' bumper sticker, and the chrome plated Christian fish emblem on the trunk." "Naturally, I assumed you had stolen the car."   ________________________________________
