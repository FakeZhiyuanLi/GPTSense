           I know you love to read a story Remember to give those eyes a break Relax your eyes, look far away And you'll feel good all day  I see you staring at a computer screen Remember to give those eyes a break Relax your eyes,look far away And you'll feel good all day  CHORUS Let our eyes see their best Don't we put them to the test No more strain, no more stress Our eyes need a rest  Looking left, looking right Look at something far a sight No more strain, no more stress Our eyes need a rest

          Last night,i had a crazy dream that i was teaching in school. My teacher had turn into kids. and i laid down the rules.  I gave them a hundred history books to memorize each night. And made them read on their heads, without turning on the lights.  I send them on a feild trip, To the outskirts of mongolia. And gave them an overnight assighment, To grow a 20 foot purple magnolia!  I asked them how many awful grades can cause how many tears. And if they got 1 answer wrong, I will just hung them up by their ears.  And when they talk or laugh in class, I will pinched them to they cry. Louder and louder! Till i woke up, Feeling very satisfied.
