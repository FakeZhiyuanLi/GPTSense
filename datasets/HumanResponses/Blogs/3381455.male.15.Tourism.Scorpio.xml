       urlLink    Anyways..usual today. I had a bit of a dunk show over lunch.. Played Ultimate in the 80+ humid, shitty weather...tied off the bottom of my shirt because we couldn't remove them..>  I had one kickass diving catch at the end of the game to win it....w/only minor scratches as a result :)  Then..came home and slept until 15 minutes ago.  Boo commentaries!

      Let's see here...Thinking about sex..moving on...  Normal day: Up at 7:15, shower, school, home, computer, checked comics... 3:30 went to the courts..dunked for some youngins..they were amazed... Being 6'4" and white does have its perks:) And Ashley, you're an even sexier beast, just to let you know (although not as sexy as someone else;) )  Hasta luego....

      7.5 hours..not of tough labor..just 7.5 hours wasted because some drunk fucks decide to stay for 3 hours...come in AFTER we close...I really hate my job  Damn the job shortage.  Ever feel awkward when you drop something and need to get down on all fours to find it? ;)

      The baseball game itself was interesting until the 8th inning..previously it was 6-6..my team lost 9-6 >  The festivities were pretty fun..average for a minor leage game.  The fireworks at the end were pretty cool..better than my local ones at the fourth of July...  I returned at midnight..I called ya..didn't get an answer..didn't mind..there's always later today...

      I weighed the pros vs. the cons, and well..the cons won. I wouldn't have enough fun for the time I'd have so I've decided to stay put and send my little brother out. Furthermore, the weather is subpar and not good for camping. I think I'll try to see a movie or something tomorrow...  Ha ha and woohoo.

      Tonight I am camping. Tomorrow night I will be camping. I will be missing some of the best fun ever while camping. Damn, I despise camping now.

      Everything is going so well..I'm awaiting the time for me to crash and burn. :-P  Family life is great..Andy is having a blast in Thailand. Everyone else is happy..it's summer and we're all staying active and happy.&nbsp; Summer school ends toorrow.. yay for sleeping in on Monday. Woo hoo!  And of course...time with Jozette is as good as it has ever been. Logical conversations...awesome surprises..these last couple of days have been awesome for me.&nbsp; I've realized what true beauty is and how to express my thanks :). I just wish I could thank God for making such a perfect specimen of a human for me to share my life with...  Things can only get better (they should in about 4 days....la la la)  I need to think of a new surprise...but I doubt I'll top the treasure map :)

      For 6 days or so, I will be missing out on a big aspect of my life....talking to you kiddo. I'll miss it more than anything else. I'm sure I will have fun, but it just won't be the same. Remember to have fun and keep kicking ass (just not mine :P)  By the time you read this (if you do), I will probably be getting tanned and hit on....  Have fun without me!
