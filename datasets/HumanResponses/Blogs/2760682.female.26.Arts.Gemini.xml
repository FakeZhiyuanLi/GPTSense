      I didn't count grams again today, but all I ate was a personal pan pizza, two unsweet teas, and three glasses of water. So far. I'm going to go start another glass of water in a moment.  Crazy boy left this afternoon, after finding every possible way to alienate me. It seemed every time I opened my mouth, he managed to pick apart every thing that I said and make it like I shouldn't even have an opinion. Smart guy, too, wanted to tell me that he thinks women are equal but still refuse to allow me to exercise my equality. I was all ready to tell the hostess that I needed a table of three, in fact, the words were already coming out of my mouth and up pops Crazy boy and his forceful manliness. He needs a girl ASAP. I just figured I should stop talking. Nothing I say is ever right anyway, as it doesn't surround his immediate life.   Husband hasn't been much better, either, though. He's insistent that everything Crazy boy says is wrong and that whatever I say is my latest ideological craze.   Men. I'm not liking them right now.

      I spent two days at a teacher's conference for Christian teachers, where they ignore the move of God in favor of tradition then berate traditional Christian schools but refuse to give them resources to become better schools. Then, they beg the overworked, underpaid, undereducated teachers for money for other overworked, underpaid, undereducated teachers in foreign countries. Meanwhile, the speakers bore us to death with ill researched material that we should have learned in college but give me a book and a weekend and I'll be six hundred pages ahead of them. It's an intentional deception, too, when the speakers mislabel their seminars with some title like "Teaching Kids To Love To Read," when they really mean "Tricks to Get Them To Read." It's not how much they read, it's if they understand and appreciate what they read.  Needless to say, I was not a happy camper being bludgeoned by conservative Christian fundamentalists for two days, away from my hot hubby. And I called him for a booty call and he wouldn't drive the 45 minutes. BooBoo. However, I did have my flamboyant friend with me and he was a great diversion from the horribly dressed big haired teachers. We were able to sit back and sarcastically use inductive reasoning to pick out who was gay, who was wishing they were, who was doing who, and exactly why conservative women need BIG hair.  The flipside of that is that HE doesn't exactly appreciate my husband's eccentricities and, um, well, I'll just say it ARROGANCE. Granted, hubby is a bit on the arrogant side, but he's allowed. He's hot. And sm'ucking f'art.  I didn't count calories or fat grams or sugar grams. I was horrible. However, I did not overeat (I left every meal wanting more) and I didn't snack. And I didn't drink sodas. Just water.

      Last night, I did have those cookies, two fig newtons. Such a cheater. I hate that I love food and I hate that I've been snowed in for four days with a house full of it. It seems to me that the world is made up of food. Good conversations are always initiated over food, parties always have food. Most conversations include, what are you having for dinner tonight or do you want to go out to dinner? And those restaurants don't help. The serving size has doubled each year. But is it just the food that is evil? Or the overall image that women just aren't beautiful if they are a size 14 or higher. I count my lucky stars that I haven't hit the 20s. At least I can wear the lower sizes from Lane Bryant. I can't even find my bra there, thankgoodness. But so what if I could? Do I not have the right to be happy despite my size? And while we are talking about size, should we focus on hair or makeup or facial features that are dictated to us by popular culture? Why am I not a size 4 waif with long hair and big doe eyes, proud to bear my breasts in the leather ensemble from the latest Fredrick's magazine? They give us fake hair, fake nails, fake eyelashes, powder finishes, girdles, and the like, to fit the societal views that women are meant to be picturesque pieces adorned on the arms of their male counterparts (who, no matter what they wear, often still look magazine-ready). We are the tokens of the ones who give us the paint and the pictures to make ourselves up like. We are their dolls. Fat, pudgy, overweight dolls who are cast aside or overlooked when we can not meet their ideals.

I watched reruns of Dawson’s Creek. I walked through the crunchy snow to the mailbox and stopped to see Kevin’s aunt and uncle. I think I’m going to play Grand Theft Auto.  And if I’m lucky, I might have a cookie later…I certainly have enough  room in by RDI to have a little bit more.

       urlLink This is the father of one of the rogue orangutans   believed to be holding Blog Boy at banana machine gun point. In a statement issued earlier this evening, he said that he is very disappointed in the use of violence and terrorist tactics of his son. He admonished his son for perpetuating the myth that orangutans are violent. Shaking his head, he mumbled that he just couldn't believe the way that this younger generation wastes the freedom that their forefathers have fought so hard for.

      Why Blog Boy has been MIA...(Or better called, my own version until he posts again)...  Friday, Feb. 13th, Blog Boy met an attractive, seemingly innocent woman who enticed him with her wiley ways and attractive black lexus. She blinded him with her beauty and hypnotized him with here eyes. He is last seen leaving Chick-Fil-A with this woman.  Saturday, Feb. 14th, Blog Boy is driven out to Asheville, NC. Here, he eats at the Possum Cafe and is introduced to a traveling coffee shop group at Malaprops. He buys two books and leaves again with Vixen.   Sunday, Feb. 15th, insisting that he should find a church to spend the Sabbath, Blog Boy begs Vixen to pull over in any town (as the Bible Belt is full of churches and he does not know which state he is in). Panic sets in.  Monday, Feb. 16th, Blog Boy awakens to find Vixen inserting a needle into his arm. She pulls him out of the lexus and lays him on the sandy gravel by the side of the road. She sits on the car's hood smoking a cigarette while she waits for dusk. The sun sets and a bright light appears on the horizon...could it be? Is it an alien ship? Is this Vixen an alien kidnapper? No, it's McDonald's semi-truck barrelling down the empty interstate. A man dressed like a clown and a woman dressed like a chicken get out and put Blog Boy in the back of the truck. He comes face to face with twenty other people, unable to move, just like himself, who are being force feed the new chicken nuggets. Meanwhile, back in reality, a clone has successfully taken over Blog Boy's daily life but has been unable to infiltrate the complex web of the internet. And we are left here, with the truth but without a trace.

      I have never had black nails!! In my life, I have never worn black fingernail polish!! Yet, this untruth is in my work file. I can understand my hair and my pants being listed in "why to hate that teacher" file but I have NEVER had black fingernails!!   I met with the Admin. today. I was waiting to see if his "prophetic" gift was turned on but apparently, that was off having coffee with his listening skills. Three times, I've told him that Kindegarten Teacher is wanting to do art. She's even told him. Frustrating.  Tonight is the big hyped release of "Passion of the Christ." While I am interested in seeing it, I would rather see it not so bunched up with church people. For instance, Jesus and an Angel went the 7pm showing tonight. I passed them as I left the candy store. Jesus didn't talk to me. And the Angel was smoking a cigarette, talking on her cell phone. I will be seeing it this weekend, though. I am excited.

      I crash hard.   It's 7pm and I'm in bed. Does that indicate the type of day that I had? I wanted to let it all wash down the drain under that rhythmic hot water but Hubby wanted to take a shower, too. I just wanted time alone in my shower sanctuary and he wanted in. Two of my cheerleaders are teenage girls. That should explain it all. Well, one likes to stir up trouble (which I think has roots in her insecurities and need for acceptance) and the other is one of those that just doesn't care and could just as soon as right her off and anyone who sides with her. So, I must tread carefully. I called them out on it and left them to talk. One left crying. There was no physical violence. Half of my class will be out on Wednesday because they are going to see Passion of the Christ. The other half will be with me, feeling very out of place because their parents have deemed them too young to see such a flick, and they will have to endure the kiddie version with the lower grades. I still have a science test to make up. Crap.

      God smiles on Sundays.  The weather was perfect. The pool hall wasn't crowded. I didn't overeat (or drink)...and I had willpower. To top off my day, I will be watching the last episode of Sex and the City on my own TV on HBO. HBO and MAX are in our subscription list. I am more than overjoyed.

      The one thing that I most proud of is that is has been nearly two weeks since I've had a soda. I sustain myself on water, green tea (with benefiber) and unsweet tea. I haven't even had a yummy coffee. Though, I have had one margarita...two, actually (and two shots of midori). I didn't eat much today (just the 'burger and fries and two 'tato skins, all day!!). I've also come to realize that low fat is high carb. And I've only lost 3lbs (if I weigh myself in the morning).  I have been feeling good about myself, though. I dyed my hair and have been using a deep conditioner, so that is great. Also, I've been using an exfoliating facial cleanser. I know, I know, I sound all junior pop-star-ish with these beauty rituals. Hopefully, though it will keep me looking young and my fellow teacheers and admin. will realize that I am not their age...in fact, they are old enough to be my parents. I just want them to realize that I can act my age and I should be able to.  Curses, though, because I speak my mind...even to them. Where is that internal censorship button that I hear so much about?

      Friday is always a good day. I didn't eat alot and what I did eat was good for me. Not to mention I walked up and down Chapel Hill today. The kids had a blast and while they did pout when I wouldn't give them money (not my responsibility, it's their parent's responsibility), they got over it and had a great time. Some of the teachers are talking...who's returning next year...who's leaving...who's teaching what. I haven't answered what I will do. I don't know, truthfully. Though, I would like to write full time in my comfy office, window open, birds chirping...but that's just summer and spring...then in the fall, when things die, and in the winter when the world is in hibernation, I'll succumb to the ills of winter depression.

      As a teacher in a private school, I've had the fortune to be able to have insanely obscure holidays off, those holidays that they have sales for but no one really observes. Hence, I had the day off. I would have had it off anyway, though, because it snowed 1 1/2 inches overnight and people freak out as if that is a snow storm of the century. It was fluffy sans ice. *Rolls eyes*  I had a bagel, a chicken salad sandwich, some SlimFast mac & cheese, and two cups of some turkey in a box thingy. I had alot of water, too. I don't count that but I've gone the restroom numerous times, so I must be drinking plenty.   Hubby's parents are next door and can't be bothered to visit. Actually, they said that they'd come over today if it snowed and they didn't have to go to work...but she has too much laundry to do, so she won't be visiting. It's not like we live a mile down the road and she might drive here. We live twenty feet (if that) apart. We can shout from our back porch to her door and have a conversation. She could put in a load of laundry, come see us for a minute (enough to discuss her wireless bill and see the cake I got for Hubby and see the new arrangements) and still be back before that buzzer goes off. It's not like we live in another state. I'm so sick of it. At least my family would appreciate it if we lived closer. At least I would feel welcome at their houses and they would visit me freely. GRRRRRRRR. And we're living here, why? Because Hubby thought it would be cheap and nice to live by his parents yet still wants to pay comparable rent...if we're going to pay rent, why not live someplace I like???????

       urlLink Hubby's gift from me . I haven't eaten much today. I had half of a serving of fried burritos and endless glasses of water plus, I've been active completing the finishing touches on my new room and helping Hubby clean up his mess and rearrange the rest of the house.   Yippee, though, because it's snowing out and it wasn't supposed to, so I'm being treated. That must be God's Valentine gift to me.

      Valentine's day is a day to sit back and remember the matyred priest who died because he performed marriages even after the decree was issued that young men shouldn't be married or ponder the life of the jailed criminal who wrote letters to the jailor's daughter. Death and crime somehow morphed into a holiday for love.  Ironically, I see the connection. How many people have killed in the name of love? Stolen in the name of love? Cheated in the name of love? And how many of them have been men?  I bought my hubby a nice Elvis cake and some Drakkar and a huge Hershey's kiss, along with a pair of "Hugs & Kisses" stuffed bears. Hubby made dinner for me and he moved all of the junk that has been cluttering our spare rooms out and Goodwill is going to pick it up. I finally have a room of my own instead of a closet. It's nice and warm and relaxing. Unfortunately, I have to share it with visitors, but we don't get many visitors and I'm bugging Blog Boy to make the trip. Will he or Won't he?  Speaking of will he or won't he...make-up or break-up...Ken and Barbie have called it quits. Good thing, too, he's been doing Skipper for ages. It's about time she took her house and split with a hunk of a surfer. Also, Cathy and Irving have decided to get married. Who's next? Will Carrie fall in love with Paris and Alex or will Big rescue her and bring her back to her senses and her true love, New York?

      I did good today. I had two green teas laced with benefiber and 1/2 cup of cake (and no candy!!) at school today and a chicken sandwich for dinner (but I had fries with that). I'm still drinking the endless cups of water.   I love Friday nights. I don't have to do anything but enjoy the evening.

      Mealtime: 1 Slimfast shake 2 green teas 4 glasses of water Lean cuisine potatoes and broccoli 4 cups of Spaghetti  My sm'ucking f'art hubby  urlLink sent me a dozen lovely roses.  I was the envy of the school, of course, I've got a hot hubby, so I'm always being envied.   I haven't been taking my cider vinegar tablets but my xenaphedrine has been screwing with my chemistry, so I think I have to stop that. Everytime I take it, I get the shakes and utterly depressed. It totally interfers with my life. But, I've been working  urlLink benefiber  into my diet and it supposedly helps with digestion. Red wine or calvados helps with digestion, too, but I couldn't drink that every night.

      My students want me to be fat. F. bought a  urlLink Cupid Build-a-Bear  for me, for Valentine's Day and brought it in early. Jealous of what F. did, W. decided that he, too, should do something special. So, he bought and called for two large pizzas to be delivered at lunch time for me, and the class, his Valentine's gift to me. I hid my utter heartbreak behind smiles. W.'s mom died last August and I have tried my best to get him to open up to me, to respond to me, to TALK to me, even if it was just for a simple "Hi." My best efforts failed. But then, he goes and does this. And it breaks me. I know that he is different outside of class, but in my class, he is just a little boy with a broken heart and so many hurts. He's adopted from South America and he just lost the most wonderful woman who has ever walked this planet. He has anger that he takes out on his brother. His father doesn't know how to be both parents. I have for so long wanted to just sit W. down and drill into his head that he can get the material and that people care if he stays up until 1 or 2 am and people care if he doesn't bring in the work that he is assigned. Ugh. He just breaks my heart and I will spend my Valentine's Day mourning his losses and his childhood and his unrealized selfworth.  And that pisses me off. I hate caring.

      McDonalds needs to be listed as a lethal drug. A Big Mac has 600 calories, french fries? 320 for a regular size? And the pies??? 260. What about the salads? up to 370 unless you order the side salad, 15 calories. All the way up 33 grams of fat. Ewwww. I felt my thighs sucking in the fat. But that's not why it should be listed as the lethal drug it is, it should be listed because I have to fight the urge to dig my big chipmunk cheeked mouth into all I can eat for $20. It's worse than fighting off that stupid craving to have a sweet cigarette or drink too much at the billards. It's thoughts like that this that make me want to  urlLink dump my lunch   into the alter at the porcelain god.  That letter of intent from school is haunting me, as my admin. says that he wants me to do English and art next year. Art, yeah, cool, as long as it's crafts. I thought about staying, if they make it less stressful and don't pile what I don't want on my "responsibility plate." I also don't want to get swept away in this big positivity wave that everyone's riding. I think they're smoking their Bibles instead of reading them.

      Lean cuisine sweet and sour chicken, 1cups worth of brownie, three bbq chips, two pieces of pizza, and a handful of peanut m&ms. However, I'm allowed. There is an exception today.☠  I was surrounded by prepubescent and hormonal teens for 12 hours. I got to work at 7:15 this morning and left them at 7:30...And three and a half hours of that was spent with six cheerleaders and arrogant parents. If that isn't an excuse for chocolate lover's fun, I don't know what is. I just want to curl up and sleep for the next week. I look forward to the three-day weekend coming up.  I got the obligatory "what are you doing next year?" letter from the admin. today. I started to fill it out but don't want to. I don't want to tell them that I won't be returning because I don't want that to slip out. It will slip out, too. Such a small school to have such a huge gossip vine. You would think that they didn't read the place in the Bible that says........  I'm sitting here, regretting the fact that I ate so much but still, comfortable with the choice. I think I want a margaritta. "The right drinks..." When Blog Boy visits this weekend, I'll have to make some up or at least some diet friendly version served with some easy on the hips deliciousness. I'm sure I can work some sort of chocolate into that. ❉

Even the television programming is depressing. I don't really feel like going out but staying in is killing me. It's like Friday nights without a date. I worked on lesson plans and decided I hate planning things. I so don't even want to plan our trip to the coast for a visit to the aquarium. That's an overnight trip. Ugh.

      Janet Jackson's nipple is gripping the nation tighter than that funky star she was wearing. Someone is suing her. Someone in the great, backwoods state of Tennesse. Someone who had probably left the room to take a piss and read about the incident on the internet, after downloading a thousand pictures to make sure that was her nipple under that piece of oddly formed metal. This someone is a woman. This someone is blaming Ms. Jackson for indecent exposure. Did Ms. Jackson reach over and pull off her own top? No. That was favorite boy toy JT. It was his hand. No one is suing babyface pop star but, let's jump on the I-Hate-The-Jackson bandwagon and get the entire family in court. People with talent should give their money away to armchair quarterbacks. But, better yet, as in the fashion of our society, women attack women, a legal catfight. Instead of backing up the last talented heroine of our pop-induced stupor, the Grammys have banned her and the society at large has turned its back on her. But, wait, let me reitterate, it was not her hand that reached across and pulled that shirt off. Aw, but JT is so much cuter and he's up for awards, we can't ban him; if we do, the throngs of mindless drones that subscribe to his every move will boycott us and what do we want? Angry feminists or angry teeny-boppers. Angry feminists have been around for years. Teeny boppers are where the money is at.   It's Ms.Jackson's fault. She allowed him to pull her removeable top piece off. She may have even suggested it. Oh yes, just as it is my fault, if I wear a short skirt and tight top and prance down the busy city street, that I be raped. Misogynst.   When did our country's ultraconservativism decide to jump in? Did it voice its opinion about the streaker? Or even about Colin Farrell and his many escapades? Did it talk out about Andy Sipowitz ass (which, by the way is way less pleasing to look at than a shot of a nipple covered in a 1/2 fist size of metal)? What about Richard Hatch? That's full on nudity and sex, but even consider the cheerleaders, whose uniforms shrink every 5 years to get the maximum appeal. Sex and sex appeal sell, that's why CBS and every other network produces reality tv. The sexual tension created between two people is a dollar sign.  BooHoo, I'm a Christian and I was seriously injured by the brief shot of the nipple. BooHoo, I need your money to help me overcome the pain of seeing a nipple. Your harsh words offend my delicate senses. I'm going to sue you and talk about you in church tomorrow.  And we end with this: Chasez responded angrily on Thursday: "That's not the America I love. Nor is this the NFL I love. I'll sing the national anthem anytime, anywhere, but not for this NFL." How far with this go? http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,110692,00.html

      We are coddling a generation of spoiled brats. We made Asian food in class today, here is what I heard. “Ewww, I don’t like different cultures.” “Why do I have to wash the dishes?” “I don’t want to clean the floor, I cleaned other things. Why are you picking on me?” (When I told one student to pick up the mess that HE made.) I’m tired of people and students acting like I’m not doing enough for them. I’m spending more money than I make and I have no administrative support. The parents don’t want to help with interactive homework, so all hands-on experience has to be in class and then they don’t bring in the materials. They want their kids to be excellent but refuse to help in the process, instead pacifying them with video gaming systems and portable DVD players and trips to Disney ever summer. School is a babysitting service where parents drop off their kids and forget about them for eight hours.   I’m not even going to try to count calories today, though I did look very fabulous in my Geisha dress. I had one tropical fruit cluster, three slices of pineapple and two cups of jasmine tea, as well as a sesame chicken lean cuisine. I also had two slices of onion and mushroom pizza for dinner. There goes my anti-carb wishes.   Husband woke up in the middle of the night last night. I’m not sure if it was because I was having a nightmare or because he was. But, I woke up with him on top of me, asking me if I was okay, and laughing. I think he slept uneasy. His mom called at midnight

      Since when do cheerleaders only cheer when the basketball is not in play? How is cheering a distraction as opposed to yelling? We had a game this afternoon, and by we, I mean the girls that I coach while laughing at and reliving my high school angst against beauty and popularity. Certainly, I'm painting a wonderfully well-rounded picture of myself. I'm the beached whale to your right, folks. My girls where ashamed/embarrassed to cheer after using the wrong cheer and then messing up a cheer and then cheering during our team's free-throw. But, cut them some slack, this is the first year cheerleading squad. Not like we have any others, either. Little Miss I'm-Too-Good-To-Be-At-School-Homeschooler-Basketball-Whore saddled up to the girls and said, "The refs can penalize the team if you cheer because it's a distraction, but you can cheer if the ball isn't in play." Suck my left toe. I've been to plenty of game where the stands are louder than the cheerleaders and the cheerleaders at games try to distract the other team. Creep.  One of my students made Cinnamon raison bread for me last night and brought it in today, so I had a slice. And I had lean cuisine sal. steak w/mac -n-cheese. That sucked. I had 23 M&Ms and then I came home (after the bball game from hell) and had two pickles (I love that pickles are fat free) and a chicken sandwich with pepperjack cheese and a bowl of SlimFast mac-n-cheese. The lowfat mac-n-cheese stuff is gross. But, I eat it. I tried a SlimFast banana bread meal replacement stick and confirmed by earlier suspicion, they, too, taste like crap. You could probably pull a pretty good prank by putting it on a shower floor. But, if you really feel the need to eat something that tastes like burnt banana, go for it.  On the serious side, Hubby's grandpa had a lung removed and in all of that excitement, his grandma had a heartache. His mom's been gone for three days, up there, helping and staying around there for support. His dad finally told Hubby tonight, with an, "I guess I better bring up to speed." when Hubby asked about the way the cars where parked over there. It's stupid to live so close to these people and yet they don't talk to us. I know that they visit when I'm not here, so let's put this all together, if you remove me from the equation, there seems to be a more open line of communication. I think that they don't like me. Hmmmmm. Yup, that's it. I have proof, too, you should see my wedding pictures (and the lack thereof that are sported around her house, but the ones of just Hubby are all up, yes, the poor boy looks like he married himself).  Tomorrow is Friday (just pretend that you hear a slightly off-key, tone-deaf female voice screeching through the night, because I am singing the praises of Friday). I can't wait until 3pm tomorrow. I have two days away from the freaks. Yippee.

      Today's menu: Celery and dill dip, lean cuisine honey dijon chicken, beef stew w/biscuits (7 glasses of water).   I want to just give up on my job(s). They suck. The people suck. No real reason other than stupidity (like saying that "structured prayer" is wrong and crazy like the episcopals, like thinking reverence is not worshipping God, like thinking a Sari is "weird" and just a crazy costume, like thinking I have nothing better to do with my life than wait on them and their kids, and SO much more). I'm just ready for the summer and ready to disappear and pretend like I'm the only one who exists in my little world. I bet I'll even hibernate for a week before I venture out in the insanity.

      Shouldn't someone just give in and invent a measuring tool that will tell me how many grams of fat, calories, and sugar that I intake. I managed to stay on plan (3 glasses of water, a slimfast soy drink, a lean cuisine meal) but plummeted when I had some yummy meatloaf and mashed 'taters for dinner. I resisted temptation, though, and did not buy out the entire Valentine's stock. Mmmm chocolate.  I could use some chocolate after the crappy day at school. They just don't know how to plan. I got the schedule for this week YESTERDAY!!! Plus, two last minute after school meetings to tell us to be more prepared. Okay. I'll be prepared when I don't have to stay at school until 5pm coaching or running to meetings and when I actually get a break instead of being in my room for 8hrs. because GOD FORBID I should leave the students alone for five minutes. And know my material beyond the scope?!?! Give me a subject that I'm familiar with. Hands on?!?! Give me the resources necessary. I don't have the money to spend $200 a month, not to mention when $200 in the most we can claim on our taxes. Then my kids want to bitch about how they want to do MORE like I don't do anything with them. "We'll bring in money or the stuff." Yeah. We'll see if they'll bring the stuff we need tomorrow. If they can't bring in what I ask for, how can I expect them to bring more of what I ask for?

      Alrighty, I had a slimfast meal drink, lean cuisine chicken, and garlic chicken with pasta. I had three cups of water and two cups of green tea.   I want to take a sick day tomorrow but can't because we've been out so much and my kids have so much work to make up. Plus, they had an attitude today that just would frighten any sub. They didn't want to do anything except complain about what I was making them do. God forbid I should make them think. Thinking is against the rules in the Christian circles.   It's supposed to get icy tonight. I wonder if it will actually amount to anything. I want to be impressed by the weather. I want real snow. I want it to either be cold or hot but not fluctuating every two to three weeks.   I think I'm going to buy some xenadrine (spelling?) from GNC. I need an extra kick in the arse.

      One of these days I'll get back to counting grams but it's so hard when you don't eat from a box. I had homemade pancakes (story to follow), and 1/2 an order each of sesame chicken and veggie low mein, an eggroll and a fortune cookie. I've had like six glasses of green tea w/benefiber and three glasses of water. I love my tea. Green tea is like mana from heaven. Also, for the week, I have boxes of slimfast stuff, so maybe I'll get better at this. I'm trying soy chocolate meal replacement drink tomorrow morning. I hope I don't gag.  Today has been one of those days that needs to be recorded. After stroking my husband's ego, I was treated to breakfast in bed. He makes the best pancakes. Then, while he read, I watched four episodes of Six Feet Under. We didn't even get dressed until 5:30 this afternoon when we went out to get dinner and now, I'm in my Pats jersey, watching the 2nd quarter of the Bowl.   I'm doing a Bible study starting tomorrow in my Bible class on Prayer.  I don't think fifth grade is too early to learn how to think on your own. Plus, if I can't teach them excellent math skills, at least I'll give them tools to think. It doesn't matter in the long run if you can do the math to tip at a restaurant but it does matter if you can form a logical opinion on anything or critically think about issues that surround you. Does it matter that I'm so Catholic in my approach to prayer that the kids are going to look at me like I'm crazy? No. By the way, Arrogant friend has adapted my views on prayer and traditions...he bitches about his brother taking credit for everything yet he can not even admit that I was praying with beads and he told me he thought it was wrong. He gets upset when he tells his brother something and a year later, his brother passes it off as his own thought YET he does the same thing to me. Stupid arrogant genius.   The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple. Mal. 3:1 Almighty and everliving god, we humbly beseech thy Majesty, that, as they only –begotten Son was this day presented in the temple in substance of our flesh, so we may be presented unto thee with pure and clean hearts, by the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.  I. What is prayer? a. Class discussion (What is prayer) b. “Lifting up our hearts and minds to God, to praise His goodness, to thank Him for His Kindness, to acknowledge our sins and ask for forgiveness, to give glory to Him.”  i. Your mind thinks about God, your heart worships Him  ii. Prayer is conversation with God 1. Would you talk to other people while talking to a friend about important things? 2. Would you think about what you would rather be doing instead of talking to a friend? 3. Would you just stop talking in the middle of conversation? 4. Would you just ask and ask and not share? c. You can pray anytime anywhere, out loud or within your heart d. God is the source of peace and joy.  i. Praying is the ultimate relaxation e. Gen. 28:12  i. Prayer is like a ladder, bridging the gap between our hearts and minds and God.  ii. Opens up the treasures of divine grace 1. What is grace?

      Here I am, wasting away in the driest Margartiaville ever. I superglued the caps onto liquor bottles my underage sister keeps hidden in her room and I'm not sure but I think I found some pot by accident. It wasnt but a small leaf but it smelled like it. Instead of turning her into Momma-cop, I decided to prank her. She'll be wondering what hit her long after I left and I won't be on the recieving end of her wrath. She's lost her backbone, somewhere, I think her current beau de-boned her like a salmon fish. I'm not sure how she got around the aggressive gene in the family. Comparably, she is quite passive compared to the rest of us. I wouldn't mind reading the blond-haired, blue-eyed Aryan crack dealer boyfriend of hers the riot act. But she doesn't want anyone to. He had the gonads to show up to Nephew's birthday party yesterday, after making her cry all weekend because he's a jealous piece of shit who thinks that every call she gets is some boy. I'd like him to give me one reason to drive my right hand through his perfect nose.   I took some great pictures while flying over the east coast on Saturday. I can't post them up here, though, because I can't deal with the crawl on the dial up internet. I wonder if I am going through withdrawl of the internet or of the general idea of independance that is lost when I rely on my mom's car. Three cars between five people with driving rights. I would go nuts.   Here it is, 11:18, or as I know it, History class in my 5th grade room ( I wonder if they did all their work in five minutes like I"ve been warned...if they have, they either did it wrong or are lying to me or the sub. I assigned three times the amount of work we usually do). I'm not looking forward to going back to that place...however, Foodtv and Dawson's Creek can only carry me so far before I start to eat my way through boredom. I've already played the PS2. I've also been up since 6:15am. Hopefully chasing Nephew will shed the excess calories that I know that I must be taking in. On the bright side of the moon, when I get back, I'll only have two days of classes before the weekend and then, only four days before Spring break - which reminds me, I have to order the Easter crafts. I better do that now.

      It's been silent in my part of the world. I have no more rants about work because I am not going back there next year. When they renew contracts, I will not be filling out one. When they announce the new positions, mine will be a vacant one. I have determined that I will not be a masochist and thrust myself against the thorns of their inept educational system. I will also not be the subject of their latest controversy. I am to be free, unapologetic, and proud. Their cultish ways will have no effect on this bird.   I've also been silent because while I have been striving to eat healthy, I've only lost five pounds and I've been extremely frustrated. So, I shopped. I shop when I'm frustrated. I bought bags of suger-free candy. Some tastes the same and they all taste a hell of alot better than that SlimFast junk I was scarfing down. So, I sit in the mornings with my unsweet green tea, popping pills that mess with my mental clarity and tolerance for depression and eating sugar-free gummy bears and chocolate. Sugar-free? you ask. Yes. And it tastes better than cardboard.   Blog Boy has been noticably absent, also. The last I heard, he had hitch-hiked across the great state of Kentucky, highjacked a commuter train and crossed the border into Canada. There, he plans on opening a small Mennonite village, full of widows (22-38yrs old) who will quilt and make jams and breads and other marketable goods so that he can concentrate on inventing a studio that will run on wind generated energy.

      I've lost five pounds but I'm so damn hungry. I tore into a five-stack of Girl Scout Cookies this evening while Husband was out climbing rocks. However, I did indulge  myself in a nice facial complete with heated mask while I was eating the cookies, so it might have been a good spa experience. All I need now is the Crest whitening and this MaryKay eye stuff to start working and I'll be all buffed up for my weekend with the family. Can I get a rum & coke on a puddle jumper?

      I've been as absent as Blog Boy. I had a good excuse, though. I was in such a mood that prevented me from expressing myself with any semblance of sanity. School has been difficult. It seems that I am on the hit list. I'm tired of being the one that they feel they need to pick on just because I'm different. Our chapel was about that today. Did anyone listen? Maybe the kids, but most certainly not the adults.

      Parents have overrun our natural lives. In fact, mothers in general have taken their pregnant swollen breasts to the extreme.   While enjoying a playful rendition of "Charlotte's Web" at the theatre last Wednesday at 9am with 300+ students in the auditorium, I witnessed a mother with a three month breastfeeding her baby. Her shirt was up and her breast was out. I will admit that I am sensitive with kids in public. Personally, I don't think anyone under 5 should be allowed out past 6pm unless they know how to be silent. But, breasts in public to feed the infants is uncalled for.

      Who's to say that God isn't a sexual being? He impregnated Mary and the OT is full of times when a barren womb was given a child. I doubt this had anything to do with man's endowment. Now, explain "The Ecstacy of St. Therese." Thought to ponder: If God enjoys sex, why is it that it is taboo?

      Queen Bee told me today that if I didn't go to the sixth grade with her kids, she would not bring them back next year. I told her to do what was best for them and to leave me out of the equation as my plans were undecided. Though, I know what I want to do. I want no responsibilities. I want to write and be published and forget that I ever had to deal with reight wing conservative Christian freaks who have nothing better to do than look down their noses at me and my blue hair and arm warmers and rings and funky clothes. I guess they missed the memo when God said that we were unique.   I'm reading Angels and Demons by Dan Brown. It is very good. I might actually learn some of the art references and historical references. The science is lost on me. We lost power last night during a fun windstorm. The wind howled through the trees. It sounded like a freight train barreling through the woods. We lost our power around 8 and I kept hoping that the school had lost power, too, but if they did, it was quick, as it didn't reset my clock.   The kids were exceptionally ornery today. I wanted to strangle the boys, as usual. Is there something in preteen boys that just irks all females? No wonder there are lesbians, they all met preteen boys when they were growing up and decided that nope, boys hold no fascination. They are icky and stinky. That's how I remember them. And the ones that are in my class either suffer from ADHD or too much pride and stubborness. Stubborn people and I clash, because I'm always right and they think they are.

      What good is a Friday night, if you're all hopped up on meds for a stupid running nose? I took a Benadryl and some antihistomenes and I feel comfortably numb. I think I'm going to end up passing out here in a few minutes. I can already hear my speech getting fuzzy.   Admin. asked me to be teacher rep. on the school board today. I wonder why. I mean, I am the most unconventional, most talked about teacher at that school. Don't they want someone who is a bit more of a "Yes" (wo)man? Luckily, I finished all of my classwork for next week this afternoon before I left. I don't have to plan at all. I can relax during my free weekend. I like those ideas. My lessons plans are done. The classwork is pulled together. I am free as a bird.  I am also tired as h377.

       urlLink If he was insignificant,   I wouldn't link to his page.   I'm going to whine and complain about work today. I went in to talk to Admin. about the black nail issue. Yes. It is still bothering me. He said that he believed that someone said that to him and that it wasn't in my file. Incidently, I stopped by Granny with an attitude and she knew about it and whispered stuff that I couldn't hear that makes me assume that she also knows who said it. This is why I hate working where I work. People are always talking behind people's backs. Another case in point: Admin. was under the impression that I would quit because of the lack of participation in morning prayer. Yeah. I'm going to quit because other people aren't praying. But, this was something that someone told him. Yack. Yack. Yack. Gossipping ninnies. I thought that they read their Bible daily? Apparently it's only been the Scriptures that they take out of context.   Hubby is working late yet again. It's annoying but I'll live. I'm just glad that tomorrow is Friday and I'm going to Southpoint for a field trip. We get to eat at BB...and how do I justify this as a proper field trip? Math and history at BB...language (research) at BN...and art in the walkway. They'll each have a camera. I just wish I had remembered to buy disposable cameras but instead we'll have to use the cameras that I have around the house. Both of which are not quite defined as working. I'll bring the digital, too. Just in case. What sucks even worse that being home alone in the growing darkness as the hours dwindle is that it's so uncharacteristically hot that I want the windows and doors open but am compelled to fear for my life like Deliverance was merely a prophesy for what could happen out here in these shadowing woods. Maybe Hyper-Dog and PMS-Dog will save my life. More than likely FIL will come running over with a loaded gun ready to gun down any freaks of nature that think that I am worth harrassing.

I didn't want that be out b/c my "team" teacher is totally cool and I wanted to tell her that I wasn't going to tag teach with her next year. But, the best laid plans of mice and men...  Okay, so Crazy Boy and I went to see the Passion of the Christ with Hubby and Rock boy and Margarita Girl. Crazy boy is insistent that I am going to Hell. He thinks that because I am not a regular church attendee. He says that I can't love Jesus because I don't embrace His people. This from Crazy Boy who decided to use prayer beads and sculpted prayers after telling me that they were wrong because of the iconographic implications. Does he not see it? He wants to stand up on some proverbial soap box and wag his finger at me like I would not know what is right for me or sound or just in my personal relationship with my Savior. Crazy Boy, who wants to pretend that he isn't judgemental because how could he be?!? and he's so understanding because no one has gone through what he has, so he must know what everyone else is experiencing.

      If I could roll my eyes and express it here,  I would. These questions have been posed: If this movie wasn't about Christ, would it be debated about over violence? If this movie wasn't religious in nature, would people care?  I have heard: The debate over the Passion of The Christ is fueld by anti-Christians who don't complain about the violence in any other movie but because this one is faith-based, then they are all up in arms.  I say: Yes, if this movie was not about Jesus, it would be critisized for its violence. I'm against anyone 12 and under seeing any violent movie, regardless of its theme. I am very aware, too, that many of my students have seen films that even I wouldn't sit through. If this was just a violent movie, people wouldn't care because it would blend in with the rest of the violent movies that people pass judgement on day to day. But, because it has been heralded as the next best thing, people have been flooding the theatres with their offspring in tow. I do think that everyone should see it but I don't think it is appropriate for children. This is ridiculous. Texas Chainsaw Massacre was historically accurate and still, I didn't see it nor would I allow my children to see it. Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, We Were Soldiers Once...I could go on with the historically accurate pictures that depict a very real era in our contemporary lives yet are not allowed in school, or I would not recommend young children seeing. But, the Passion of the Christ is historic and faith-based, so let's put on the good clothes and buy the cheap tickets, ma, we're going to the moving picture show but we best go before dark 'cuz that's when all them weirdos go out.  Did I mention that I saw Jesus on opening night?

      The Passion of the Christ is being preverted by Christian fundamentalists. The movie in itself is an epic masterpiece recanting the story of Jesus with beauty and iconic tradition as well as horror and violent graphics. But, could it be a movie about the suffering of the Christ without the violence? The pornography comes after the movie is shown and Christians bring the images in their heads home and to church and to work with their narrow evangelical charismatic teachings mixed in to make an ignorant margarita.  These are the people who are viewing the movie 2, 3, & 4 times (in less than a week) and finding new places to insert charasmatic rejoicing. Applauding the foretold prophesies and ignoring the suffering of Mary.  In a recent discussion that I had to listen to, "educated" people pondered the beatings down the ViaDelorosa and if it was historically accurate...wondering if the Stations of the Cross was historically accurate, because afterall, it did come from the Catholics. Also, they commented that it should not have ended with just Jesus being risen but rather expanding upon that.These are also the people who think that it is okay for children to go and see this movie and that an NC-17 rating would have been the work of the devil and would have just prevented the story of Christ from being far-reaching. These are the people that think that it children should be exposed the violent images that could possibly haunt their impressionable minds yet won't let them watch anything above a PG rating that does not tote a Christian theme. There are plenty of "Passion" films that are in abundance during Holy Week that still bring horrific images to my mind because I was not mentally mature enough to handle those things at 10, 11, & 12.   How can one claim to be caring yet discount that though it may be a true story, the agony does not need to be witnessed by the young? How is it that we are getting away with exposing our children to this but freaking out over a nipple that you could only see if you searched the web for a close-up?

      Fine. I'll  urlLink update  but that doesn't mean that I have to like it. And, to make it all that much better, I actually have a response for this anti-matrimonal smut that is passing through the electronic wires.   Granted, some over-zealous, spoiled princesses create a money-pit of a wedding ceremony, wasting hours and people and money on an event that she'll document and fuss over for five years, until she makes the poor sap do it again or finds a newer model. Also, I concede the point that many uninformed brainwashed conservative waifs often settle for the man with the best pint of vodka in his hands. However, this does not corrupt the entire institution of marriage. It just makes the men who marry the princesses stupid and the women who become warm punching bags idiots. Some abused women I do have pity upon, the ones who have no where else to go and just wait it out until the right time (thank you, mom), or the ones who murder the bastard in his sleep...but the woman who knew what she was getting into and still chained herself to the creep does not deserve pity. She needs an education and a backbone.   Fixing that last sentence, my train of thought goes to early this evening when Hubby and I were discussing the proper usage of prepostions and if they are used correctly at the end of sentences. I was arguing for. He was against. I heard Teddy Rosevelt in my head, "This is nonsense up with which I shall not put." Years of studying English and I remember that. (Like it?) So, in order to prove my point, I pull out the old freshman English manuals from the real college (not the little one) and earnestly try to prove myself right. I did in the end, only to have him concede and so it was a battle lost and won. Time was also wasted (more time than it is taking you to read this mess).   Stanford testing is going this week. Each section has a timed limit, but we aren't sticking to it because the admin. believes that each student works at such a different level, they should just finish at their own pace. Are we breeding a generation of slackers? Or spoiled slackers? Let them work at their own pace. Teach them with manipulatives if they learn that way but teach the others who learn auditorially with lecture. Teach them according to their own learning styles. How does a class of 20 do this? I don't know and I only have 6. Is there any wonder our kids are going to grow up to be lazier than the Generation Y? Are they to be Generation Xbox?

      *Yawn*  I was at the store today and some lady (with high, curled eighties hair) had the nerve (must have been insecurity about her middle region. She looked like she had an inner tube around her waist under her shirt) to comment on what I was buying. "She doesn't need that." Okay. Now, let's see what was in my arms: a box of organic cranberry kashi, dried apples, dried plums, bananas, and healthy choice ice cream, also, a pint of Phish Food for Hubby. Now, let's look at her cart: unidentifible canned food, boxes of mac & cheese, two bags of hershey minatures, two loaves of bread, a package of fudgesicles, a bag of ChipsAhoy...I'm not sure what else but it did not include veggies or fruits. My feelings were actually hurt and my quick sarcasm and wit were unattainable. I just walked away.   45 sleeps left until freedom.

      Today was my day back after a much needed break. However, I jumped feet first into a slop of insecurity and whining from Insecure Guy. This guy has badgered me with "the world is ending" emails about a gall bladder surgery on Perky Girl. He has treated it like cancer. I've had my gall bladder out and aside from my anxiety with needles, it was a day surgery. Yet, he has insisted that we call Perky Girl's room number because it would mean so much to her.   Blog Boy has returned and posed a haunting question, to which I answer:  urlLink I will do nothing.     46 more sleeps.

      Blog Boy has been MIA. I, however, have the inside information. Three asparagus where plotting against him, the tomato wanted to throw him in the dungeon. However, the carrot had a better idea. They poured Jack Daniels down his throat. He fell to the floor and has not woken up since. He snores loudly. Meanwhile, the cucumber and the grapes bound him to a rolling chair. They rolled him out of the room and into a moving van. If you see it, it says "You move it - You break it." They were last seen driving south west. The squash told me.  Meanwhile, I am in the middle of nowhere, practicing my best impression of a sloth. It has been working well. I think I'm going to start a cleansing diet today. Just for the day. I can't commit to anything past the morning, though.  Today's diet: Ginger Hopper: 1/4 inch slice ginger root 5 carrots 1/2 apple  Cleansing Cocktail: 1/4 inch slice ginger root 1 beet 1/2 apple 4 carrots  Liver Mover: 1 beet 3 apples  Waldorf Salad: 1 green apple 1 stalk celery  Ginger Fizz: 1/4 inch slice ginger root 1 apple sparkling water  I'll supplement this with green tea (unsweetened) and benefiber.  Next, I may try the Seneca Indian cleansing diet. Day one - only fruits and their juices Day two - drink herbal teas Day three - eat all veggies Day four - veggie broth  All recipes and diets come from "Juicing for Life" by Cherie Calbom & Maureen Keane.

      The saga continues:  Message from Insecure Guy The latest addition to our Board is a man named ** **. He is a Christian.He also has computer skills which are about at the same level as you. I am asking him to do some of the "stuff" that you were doing - with the exception of writing and perusing grants - until school is over for you. I know that you are torn between a number of directions you could go such as remain at **, move back to ** or just do **. You have to know that I don't want you to leave **.  I just wanted you to know that I'm still out here and thinking about you. Write, call or IM me when you get a chance.  Argh.

      The sob story of a whinning adolescent middle-aged drama queen:  Insecure Guy comes up to me today. "I'm going to have someone else do this for me." And "You're looking so good. It's been so long. You look good." And "I just didn't know if you cared." And "Where do you stand with this project?" He left like he had just broken up with me. I told him I had no time, when I had time, I'd help out again. He just kept looking back over his shoulder like I was walking out of his life. Meanwhile, he's wanting me to give him all of this stuff that I had for the project. I thought to myself, you're a freakin' girl. He left Perky Girl at the office and came into my room. "Come see me." He says. "You know where I am." Yup. And I don't have the time or energy to go. "Don't be a stranger." Yup, because I care enough about a mid-life crisis to want to want to be more than a stranger.   *Yawn* I am so tired of this.

      Insecure Guy is being all freaky. He emailed to see if he could meet with me after work tomorrow (and bring Perky Girl). He wants me to bring all off this stuff since I "won't do it anymore." He's got this list of stuff but all I said I couldn't do was print some stupid stuff off that has nothing to do with what we are doing. He's acting like a teenage...a freaky middle-aged teenager.

      I have an overweight middle aged friend to whom I will refer to as Insecure Guy. Insecure Guy wants to pull high school "are you my friend" drama after I spend the day dealing with stupid high school drama. Boo-hoo, I haven't heard from you. Boo-hoo, you haven't written or called me in a week. Boo-hoo, I guess we weren't really friends. Boo-hoo, why won't you talk to me? My tolerance level, despite the guidance of St. Therese d'Avilla, is extremely thin, dental floss thin. So, in the course of a handful of emails, we hash it out and I think he's smoking pot because apparently, our 'friendship' is so valuable and yada yada yada. I have a husband, I don't need a girlfriend. Anyway, Insecure Guy is whining about how I don't have time for him and I don't care. He is right. I don't care. I'm not one for codependant relationships. I would rather that I have independant relationships in which it doesn't matter when I call and if I don't call for a week or more, it's perfectly alright. Boo-hoo, you didn't notice when I wasn't there. Suck your big toe. I don't care if you're not there, unless I want to talk to you and chances are, unless I have something to say, I don't want to talk to you. There are only a handful of people who I want around when I have nothing to say and they do not include some gray-haired, cancer-spotted, balding guy who is overly concerned with generating rumors about himself. I have a zero tolerance policy with codependant men who want to be girlfriends.

      I did issue a warning. I have a very active imagination. Blog Boy was supposed to be here yesterday and he did not arrive. The last I heard from him was Friday eve, when he was in need of rest and ibuprofren.  *The state in which he resides has spontaneously thrown up stone walls, thus secluding him and his fellow traveller in the forests and mountains and rivers. This stone wall that traces the border is so mighty and high that it has abolished all communication outside of the state.  *In need of sleep after being awake for 48+hours, Blog Boy fell into a soft bed and has recovered almost 48 hours of that sleep. He awoke once for a shower and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  *He was kidnapped by rogue pancake bandits and is being held under the threat of pure maple syrup while eating blueberry pancakes.

      Check out Blog Boy, he updated and it wasn't me that proded him, but his own conscious.   Eight more school days left. 11 more sleeps left. I am counting day the days to freedom. It looks, though, like I will be teaching next year, for at least the first half of the school year. Fall is so much easier than spring. It doesn't seem to last as long. I hope that I won't be required to go to Virginia for Spiritual Emphasis Week, however, because I don't want to spend a week in a foreign place.   Husband has been a great guy lately and to know specifics, you'll have to ask him but even though he can be a jerk sometimes, he really has a sweet spot.

      Ignore the historical meanings: Jack Spratt could eat no fat,  His wife could eat no lean,  And so betwixt them both,  They licked the platter clean.  My fear is that I will push 400 lbs, loose my two front teeth, and greedily gum bon-bons as I sit on the couch watching Jerry Springer, while a little rugrat or two runs around the double-wide trailer, naked and pissing on the floor. I fear that I will grow lazy and lose my creativity, that my husband will join a whore of the month club and I'll be one of those white, trailer trash wives who curse their husband and children and have no contact with the outside world except for satellite t.v.  I'm going to be a fat, drunk cranky old lady with bad hair and teeth whose kids smell like day old urine and dog feces. Their clothes will be torn and dirty, hand me downs from the reject bin at the dollar store. They will have bad hygiene and natty hair. Meanwhile, my husband will be dressing in crisp cargo pants, passing time climbing a mountain or filming his next big flick.

      My review of Troy.  Yes. I went on opening weekend. I went because I'm cheap and the only matinee worth watching was Troy. Kill Bill 2 wasn't playing until 7:20.  We will completely disregard the lack of historical reality, as it was loosely inspired by Homer but not based on. We will also try to ignore that in one scene, someone forgot to finish putting on Helen's makeup. Paris was a pussy. Hector was the hero. Achilles was an asshole but gorgeous. I saw the shadow of Brad Pitt's ass. Thetis was lucky to lay in the same room as a naked Brad Pitt. Odysseus, played by Sean Bean, was outstanding. Does this mean an Odyssey might be in the works? Eric Bana was mediocre. Orlando Bloom did not showcase his talents. Diane Kruger was decent, but I've seen more beautiful actresses, to be the face that launches a thousand ships, she was lacking.   I did not like how the mythological gods/goddesses didn't play a big role. The immortality behind Achilles wasn't explained, neither was any other great hero really touched upon, such as Aeneas or Ajax. At least not that I could decipher. I have hunches but nothing concrete.   I got dinner and a movie for my trouble, though. Panera bread, french onion soup and mushroom and mozerella panini. I also got to have popcorn and coke. My husband loves me. I love that he spoils me.

      Interesting update on the layout.   At work today, people talked about "breaking the word curse." I am unsure about my feelings about this. Basically, it came down to all of that bitching and complaining that we do about people is actually a curse on that person's life. So, we were reprimanded for having opinions that were not uplifting. I guess I can agree with the general principle of "breaking the word curse" but not the guilt over what we say. I've had enough guilt. I'm Catholic...  Which brings me to the next point of outrage. The Bible curriculum may change BUT, some people don't want to use this great book with interactive lessons because of the word catechism. They think it is Catholic. Somewhere people forgot basic vocabulary and the fact that every denomination could/should have catechism...a summary of beliefs reduced to questions and answers.

      Here's my kareoke: I'm standing in a smokey dive, the stage in a foot off the floor and is illuminated by awful blue lights. Despite my sunburn, I look pale white. Dum, dum dum, strums the track's guitar: I hate the world today. You're so good to me, I know but I can't change. Tried to tell you, But you look at me like maybe  I'm an angel underneath, Innocent and sweet  Yesterday I cried. You must have been relieved  To see the softer side, I can understand how you'd be so confused, I don't envy you. I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one I'm a bitch,  I'm a lover, I'm a child,  I'm a mother, I'm a sinner,  I'm a saint, and I do not feel ashamed. I'm your hell,  I'm your dream, I'm nothing in between. You know you wouldn't want it any other way.  So take me as I am, This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man. Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous, And I'm going to extremes: Tomorrow I will change, And today won't mean a thing  I'm a bitch,  I'm a lover, I'm a child,  I'm a mother, I'm a sinner,  I'm a saint, and I do not feel ashamed. I'm your hell,  I'm your dream, I'm nothing in between. You know you wouldn't want it any other way.  Just when you think you've got me figured out, The season's already changin'. I think it's cool you do what you do And don't try to save me.  I'm a bitch,  I'm a lover, I'm a child,  I'm a mother, I'm a sinner,  I'm a saint, and I do not feel ashamed. I'm your hell,  I'm your dream, I'm nothing in between. You know you wouldn't want it any other way.  I'm a bitch,  I'm a tease, I'm a goddess on my knees. When you hurt,  When you suffer, I'm your angel undercover. Im in love,  I'm revived, Can't say I'm not alive, You know I wouldn't want it any other way.  O-o-o, o-o-o-ooooo O-o-o, o-o-o-ooooo O-o-o, o-o-o-ooooo *Leaves stage and quickly and successively downs three straight tequilla shots*  So, does that contract mean that for one week Blog Boy has to answer any question posed by Psycho Girl truthfully or does it mean that there is only one question that must be answered truthfully? Either way, with Blog Boy survive a lunch date? Will Blog Boy have to assume witness protection to escape Psycho Girl?? We'll have to keep reading.... urlLink Blog Boy and Psycho Girl

      Women are sane. They are manipulative. They are finicky. But, they are sane. The changes in attitude, opinion, or whatever are merely the vocalized version of what most men don't admit to/acknowledge. Why is it, therefore, if women are considered to be "insane" by the general public that they hold the most influential jobs - mother (exclusive to women), and teacher (not exclusive but it is rare to find a male teacher)?   We went to the beach. I am now red from the knees down to my pinky toe and I feel like the sun burned straight through to my bones. Hubby had a fun time with the boys. I think he liked exploring the forts and playing war and pillow fighting as much as they did. A testament to him, however, is that they all fell asleep on the floor by the door to his room. Meanwhile, I had to fight with some of the parents to get them to control their kids or let me. It was a great trip, overall. Since I have not announced that I would prefer to not return next year and the Admin. announced that I would be the English/French/Creative Writing teacher for ms/hs next year, I was bombarded with beaucoup de questions about the lessons next year and how we could incorporate visiting the Fort again.   The Athletic banquet was tonight and it was uneventful. Not alot of my squad showed up, so I only had to speak for three minutes (which seemed like an eternity and was punctuated by my rapid heartbeat).   Onto bigger and better things...next week, I'm going to Carowinds...anyone want to come?

      Insecure Guy emailed me, wanting to know my plans for the fall. I just don't want to talk to him. I don't want to explain what I am doing or why I am doing and listen to how it impacts his life and his whining over how much he misses me. Friends that I like and don't talk to for great periods of time don't whine so much. I want to stay in my quiet little corner away from needy middle aged men who want to say how much they miss me and talking to me. I am not that interesting of a person. And all I did was stop by his office when I had a free moment, I didn't call him or email him or IM him. How in the world do codependant people survive? I refuse to answer to him. I refuse to say, Hi, I'm not working next semester. I'm pregnant. I'm writing. I don't want to deal with your drama. Why do I refuse? Because I do not need to answer to him. He is not my husband or my father or even a good friend. He is an old man who won't leave me alone.   On another note, I miss the beach. I miss the salt water and the cool air and the salt water taffy and the fried clams and the smell of wet sea weed. I miss the shells and the soft sand and the rough rocks and the ships passing on the horizon. I miss the cranberries and wild blueberries, fresh strawberries, and homemade root beer.   Yesterday was a high day. Today is a low day. Do shifting hormones contribute to bipolar behaviour?

So, I want take-out. Meanwhile, I ask Husband and he's upset because I want to spend money on food. My irritation with this is that he wants to save the money not because I'm pregnant and not working next semester but because he wants to save all of his money for the movie that he is making. I hate money.

      I know why women have the power in a relationship.   Our minds (men v. women) are controlled by differing sensations. Women crave the safety sensation while men crave the physical sensation. With this mind, I sight collegehumor and porn sites, which are marketed towards men. Secondly, women's magazines revolve around "do this and keep him" articles that breed fear in the minds of women. Women use what men need/crave in order to satisfy themselves.   The question now is, who would want to be with a woman who, with this knowledge, abused this in order to gain the upper hand in a relationship? Case: Woman wants expensive Manolo Blanik shoes, $400, for Christmas. She smiles and uses her power and gets Man acting like jell-o. Then, she says, "Oh, I want these shoes." Then, she gets shoes.   ANYWAY  Insecure Guy hasn't bothered me in a while but he signs on every now and again to AIM to check to see if I am signed on. I also have it on good authority that he has sent a few emails to other people asking about me/wondering about me/ hinting that I have just dropped off the face of the earth because I have turned away from God. I would set him straight, but it's not of his business and truthfully, I don't care. He'll be the one with egg on his face when he realizes he was wrong.

      I just watched "My life without me." It's about this girl, 23, with a great husband who took off his shirt to dry her tears because she was crying and he didn't have a tissue and they have two cute girls. She finds out that she is dying from a cancer that is moving to her liver and she has two months to live. She makes a list of things that she wants to do which includes making another guy fall in love with her and to sleep with other men, as well as record messages for her girls, her husband, and her mom. She doesn't tell any of them that she is dying.   It was sad because she was a bitch to her husband by cheating on him. It was selfish because she didn't give them the opportunity to say goodbye, to have closure. It pissed me off and it made me cry. I hate that.

      This is the post-birthday wrap up entry.  Husband bought me exactly what I wanted for dinner. A large mashed potato from KFC and a double decker from Taco Bell. Then, I got to open my present, which was an iSight. Very cool. And, unbeknownst to me, he invited people over. His parents and RockClimbing Grrl. My hair wasn't done and I had no make up on and I wasn't even wearing a bra. I had to fix that. But, I got a new laptop bag and a cake. I really wanted a cake. It doesn't feel like a birthday without a cake. Husband had even thought about making his own cake for me but didn't know how to do that and surprise me and he was worried about how it would turn out. I told him that I made him a lopsided cake one time, I don't think it matters what it looks like.   I have to go to work today. I have to finish my paperwork and talk to the admin. about next year. How am I going to make a decision??

      Today's menu: (as of time of posting) Bagel with cream cheese 1 cup of V8 splash 1 bottle of Propel 3 fig newtons 1banana 1 potato 1 cup grapes 2 cups of water 3 choc. chip cookies  I'm depressed. I've been feeling so sick. Husband hasn't been very good lately. I've done my best to make sure that he is happy and I know that in at least one way, I've failed at that. But, that doesn't excuse his horrible behaviour towards me. First, he tells me that I am not strong enough and that he doesn't want to speak for me. To this, I counter, it is just easier that way, since he often corrects me, so either I stay silent or I look stupid. Which would be better? Next, he tells me that I wear my underwear the wrong way because the back of my underwear was sticking up past my pants when I bent down to pick up some Tylenol PM. And when I bring this up to him, telling him that it hurts my feelings, he just says that his way is best anyway.   I'll admit, I am rather emotional lately but dealing with these emotions and my own insecurities is rather exhausting, I don't need him to add to my fears and whatnot. He can still live in denial, which he is and plans to stay until December, and criticize me but I can't. I have to deal with this daily and I don't need his crap. How is his unloading this stuff on me going to make me feel better or at the very least be able to improve in the area that I know I am lacking?

I've done three loads of laundry, vacuumed three rooms, mopped two floors, and done the dishes, not to mention I've cleaned the dreaded bathroom. I've had a wonderful first day of official summer break but I'm suppossed to turn in my decision about next year. Anyone care to make it for me. I just can't seem to make myself say yes or no.

      Today is our anniversary. He bought me a porch swing and I flaked out because I didn't buy him anything. With all of this new worry and the worry over money and being so close to the porcelain god, I just didn't buy him anything. I don't know what to do about that anyway. I may order him a DVD set off the internet, though. He might like that. I feel so bad but I've been so wrapped up in feeling like I'm going to die. I have been so selfish. He has been very understanding. His "romantic debt" has been wiped clean, for at least two years. I need to find a way to make this up to him.

      It pisses me off when people make plans and don't confirm or cancel until the last minute. Five o'clock this evening is when I found out that guests that I thought where coming over (that I was making shrimp spring rolls and fried chicken tossed salad for) where not going to come over. Instead, they are rescheduling to Monday. This just puts a bump in my schedule. The food that I bought for tonight and prepared will not last until Monday, so I'll have to shop again on Monday, which really sucks because I don't really like grocery shopping. Oh well. I get a spicy chicken sandwich and Mr. Pibb out of it. Though, I've  been really craving Arbys lately.   I'm beginning to think that I've acquired an obsession with death. My favorite shows have progressed from Will & Grace and Friends to Dead Like Me and Six Feet Under. Maybe it is because everything is in reruns and I have no choice but to rent complete seasons of HBO and SHO programs. Sopranos is on my list, too. Big Brother 5 is new this summer...and I'm ashamed to admit that I've been watching it. Mainly, I watch it and get pissed at the frat boys who seemingly run the house because no one can stand up to them...it's high school fear and they are playing it for all it is worth. I hope that things turn out unexpectedly and these frat boys are voted out soon.   No rain today but the sky is gray and I'm waiting for an evening storm.

      The purple and green trees are damp, leaves weighing down under the build up of droplets left by last night's rain or this morning's mist. The spiderwebs are glistening with specs of water that outweigh the spiders. The gray clouds are full, ready to burst. It has been this way for three days and the sun has not threatened to dry and burn the blossoms. The fig trees scent is carried on the light breeze, mingling with the eucalyptus and apple blossoms. During the hot, humid, heavy air that scalds the landscape normally, these scents are vague or surpressed.   I'm going to eat some cheesecake and wait for the sky to open up again.

      The native tribe that lives on the fog drenched island dress their prize female up for the giant hairy ape. Meanwhile, the big industry company vies for the bubbling crude below the tribe's feet. In the midst of all of this, a beautiful, blonde woman is bought by the tribe. They paid with an animal tooth necklace, so it wasn't kidnapping. Their first offer was much more lucrative, six of their best women for their own blond, fair skinned beauty. Then, Kong takes his full moon sacrifice and falls in love with her, bathing her in the waterfalls and blowing gently on her to dry her off. Because giant ape breathe first thing in the morning is fresh and clean.   I find it hard to believe that an ape would rather eat the waspy young women put up on the sacrifice block than any of the well-fed, rounded men that spend their evenings in whatever debaucherous behaviour native Pacific islanders without the comforts of our civilization advances do. But, the industry wants the island. The native islanders are kicked off the island. But, Kong enjoys the pretty face of the struggling actress, even as she tries to convince him that it will never work. Oh why do the sensitive guys have to be big hairy apes? I guess who ever gets put up on the sacrifice altar next won't appease the big ape. However technologically challenged this island is, I wonder why all the women are given to the ape...are the men sexist or gay? I think Kong just needs a Queen Kong.

      Or better yet, when NO ONE attempts to exercise their brain.  I was in a discussion recently with religious leaders (not necessarily people who have titles but people who influence alot of people and are the "Natural Born Leader" type), the loud people who talk too much and have very little to say. The topic: Prohibition, the Bible and alcohol Their foundation: Proverbs 21:17, Ephesians 5:18, & Numbers 6:3 I'll give you a minute to look those up on biblegateway.com Proverbs and Ephesians seem to talk more about not being drunk or addicted to wine while Numbers is talking about a Nazarite vow where if you go by this, you shouldn't even eat grape jelly or drink grape juice. Don't pass the fruit cake.  Now, onto the public forum, the democratic campaign is wooing female voters by sticking their hand out to NARAL and planned parenthood, encouraging women to become right-wing targets by wearing a bulls-eye t-shirt entitled, "I had an abortion." That is akin to walking down the street with an open invitation for harassment and heckling. At least, though, they have a place for women...Republicans lop the lot of us in with family development, as if we are merely incubators for the next round of middle-aged men who pass laws based on their own fears. I tell ya what, give me an insurance that covers birth control pills (viagra is already being covered, the irony is not lost) and I'll vote for whatever candidate can promise me that insurance will cover the feminine needs that I have. There is my choice, vote for a party that allows for the abuse of a well-meaning law (Roe v. Wade) or vote for a party that disregards my personal well-being. Where's the hanging chad for the feminist party?  Did anyone know that there are more presidental candidates for 2004? Oh yes. From the Libertarian party, Micheal Badnarik. From the Independant party, Ralph Nader. From the Constitutional party, Micheal Peroutka. From the Green party, David Cobb. And, the Reverand Al Sharpton. Broken down, Al Sharpton, David Cobb, and Ralph Nader are similar to John Kerry on the issues. Micheal Badnarik and Micheal Peroutka are similiar to George Bush. So, if this really is a campaign for "Anyone but Bush" why aren't we hearing from the rest of these candidates? With all these choices, one would venture to think that perhaps, one party could get it right combine the best of both major candidates and sweep away the election.   What I find amusing this morning, though, is how much the democratic party is against the war on terrorism, but they are still completely petrified, locking down Boston. Train stations are closed up to 45 miles around the city limits. I also find it funny that prostitutes from all over are being called in to town as back-ups for the regular girls because of the high demand. Southern belles and California blondes are flocking to the Hub to help stock the strip clubs and streets and hotels for this G-rated event. Makes me wish I was 34-24-34 and coordinated.

      What else is there to talk about? With the democratic convention heating things up in the frosty north, republicans are scrambling to take notes on how to not do things at their own convention. I heard the free speech zone for the repubs is going to have portapotties, something the protestors in Bean Town are protesting. Tourists. The major morning news shows all have correspondants hanging out inside the Fleet Center and even the Daily Show has gone to Boston for Jon, John, & John in John-John's home state.   Then, there is the ever present fear of quoting the wrong religious text in the wrong company. What else is there left to talk about? Favorite recipes? Tv Shows? The benefits of antioxidants? The genetic mutations of a four year old in Germany?   Here's my answer, for all the dems and repubs and religiously minded people: come home in the morning light  my mother says when you gonna live your life right  oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones  and girls just want to have fun  oh girls just want to have fun     the phone rings in the middle of the night  my father yells what you gonna do with your life  oh daddy dear you know you're still number one  but girls they want to have fun  oh girls just want to have    that's all they really want   some fun  when the working day is done  girls, they want to have fun  oh girls just want to have fun    some boys take a beautiful girl  and hide her away from the rest of the world  I want to be the one to walk in the sun  oh girls they want to have fun  oh girls just want to have     that's all they really want  some fun  when the working day is done  girls, they want to have fun  oh girls just want to have fun,  they want to have fun,  they want to have fun...  *Remember to jump up and dance like you are convulsing with your arms waving high above your head while this tune circulates through your head.*

      *Falls to kness. Clasps hands together in a penitent way. Blinks big doe eyes brimming with tears.* I'm sorry. Do not avoid AOL IM any more. I will promise to reign in my biting sarcasm and not use easy targets as fodder for my fun. I am being sincere, by the way, not at all crazy or insane.  *Stands up. Brushes off knees.*  I want to go outside. It is, however, too humid and hot to venture out in the deep space of hell. I wish that it was hot and not humid, a nice breeze, like summers on Cape Cod. I want cool water and air I can breathe. I want fresh clams and warm sand. I want strawberry pancakes and homemade root beer. But, since these things do not exist in this world, I will have to wait until fall before I can venture outside again. Fall is my favorite season anyway. I like the changing colors and fantastic smells of pumpkins and crisp apples. But, the leaves don't change colors here. They just turn brown and die, falling to the already dying, dry grass. So, maybe I'll wait until winter...but there is no snow and how can one make a snowman without snow? Maybe spring...

      Why should I want to get my M.A. when the people around me are already the best and yet still so far below me? I know how stuck up that sounds. We get the local newspaper in the mail, for free. They don't set high standards for themselves right there. I applied to work with this local newspaper when I moved here, fresh out of college with my diploma in hand. They said that I did not have enough experience. I did not have enough experience for a small town newspaper that has more grammatical problems than a high school freshman's first paper. The run-on sentences and comma splices scream insanity. Yet, I am not good enough because they are the best. Thus, my eternal burning question...why should I strive for something better when no matter how good I can get, I will still be not good enough?  That was paragraph one, my rant on the professional industry. Next, is paragraph two, my rant on religious nuts.  I found a webpage that is a group of grown men and women, ministers in this denomination, gossiping about other people in the denomination and ranting about the liberalism of our society today. I thought to myself, what a great place to read about things that I can write about in short satires. But, I read an article that talked about Mrs. Heinz-Kerry taking the podium and speaking her mind. She was asserting her views and showing her support for her husband. I thought it was a great article. But, I must have been wrong. Flaming after that article was a slew of derogatory comments and ideas about women and their role in the public life, as well as private life. These men (and the women were silent) spoke about how women should be silent, seen but not heard, to paraphrase the flamers. I believe that it got at least 20 responses before a moderator deleted the mess, on the urging of one person who asked that the demon-crats be deleted.  If you ask me, everyone is stupid. No one is right.   Next, let's talk about how it is now week fifteen and still, I am rushing to the bathroom when I wake up and having a very hard time keeping the food that I do eat from resurfacing. Nothing has worked. Not B6. Not crackers. Not ginger. I think someone lied. This doesn't stop after 12 weeks. This continues and makes me wonder why anyone would want to do this on purpose. Those that do are masochistic.

      The new Target Supercenter was created for me. I can go in, get fresh produce, browse the international aisle, which includes more than the Old El Paso Taco kits, load up on clothes, house supplies and cute knick-knacks then pass some time sipping yummy (unburnt) Starbucks coffee before I decide to call it a day. One could spend a lifetime in there and not have to leave. They even have exotic fruits and kosher items. This is a big step for this redneck area. These are people who think that Mexican food should always come with rice and beans and the waitstaff should speak unbroken English. If you asked them what a star fruit was, they would likely reply a gay actor.   I went to see Harry Potter last night. I think that as the dynasty moves on, the special effects and cinematography is getting better. I read the books, so the plot isn't surprising but I do have to hand it to Ms. Rowling, she does write exceptionally well and the twists and turns of her roller coaster novels do transfer well to screen. I had wanted to see Stepford Wives, but due to the fact that it is no longer running in the theatres here, a fact that husband is very happy about, I will have to rent it.   Insecure Guy IMed me when I had my old name up but I had my away message on, so I was saved. He said that he just wanted to see how I was now that I was back in town...oh yeah, I told him I was out of town and extremely busy. I was rather hoping that I could be incognito while here and avoid all contact with the over-the-hill freak who seriously has boundary issues. Maybe I should rename him Co-Dependant Guy.

      I don’t want to do anything today. I want to sit here in the quiet and eat oranges and do nothing but play games. However, I’ve got to get up and do some housework and then we’re going out to eat and to see a movie. Tomorrow, I will be a vegetable.  I do have more discourse on my favorite Blog Boy, though. After careful consideration of his current situation, and the insanity that he inflicts upon himself, I’ve decided that he needs to stop re-reading his own blog. That can be quite depressing. Also, if I don’t spend my entire blog correcting his spelling grammar, then he shouldn’t worry about it. Next, he should get the comment feature. This will not only let me badger him on a more regular basis, but it will allow me to see who lurks in the internet darkness critiquing his statements. Then, I can wage war on the faceless few.   August is coming up and it is almost time for back to school shopping, so in the spirit of junior high, I think that it is time for Blog Boy to graduate to high school. Once in high school, Blog Boy can separate himself from the junior high issues by claiming rank higher in the pecking order, leave those pests on the bottom rung while he climbs to the mid-way point. I’m not sure what is past the mid-way point, I’ve never been able to see past the pom-poms. In order to graduate from junior high to high school, though, a move is usually required. Most junior highs are not housed in the same facilities as the high school. Where, oh where could Blog Boy move to? Metaphorically that is. Move away from the crazy. Move away from the feeling desperation. Move away from unhealthy relationships.

      It has been 12 days since Insecure Guy last emailed me. And here is his latest:  I'm a bit surprised I have not heard back from you. **** told me that you are expecting. CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! I am so happy for you. I know how much you want to be a mom (and what a wonderful mom you will be) so I know you must be ecstatic. I am very happy for the both of you. Please keep me posted. How far along are you? Please let me hear back from you.  Let me address this in parts: 1. It's only been 12 days.  2. Yes. I am. I don't want to be a mom, (yes, I will be wonderful) and no, I'm not ecstatic. 3. I don't want to keep you posted. 4. I don't like it when people beg for email responses.  I just want to be left alone. Grrr.  Now, I'm waiting on Blog Boy to prove my theory wrong...

      Dear Blog Boy, My husband is working with your dad tomorrow night. They have spoken to each other. Neither one has any idea if you live or die. While I'm sure that you can recite a verse of stressful things that you are encountering right now, I have my own theory. Giving the circumstances of your fairly crappy weekend, I'm theorizing that you are avoiding certain people. Feelings of responsibilty over and beyond what already stresses you out probably has you high-tailing it away from common forms of communication with said people, email, cell phone, etc. How do I know this? It's a logical response that I have exercised quite a few times. Not to mention that given your feelings about these over and beyond responsibilites which you have expressed, I have theorized that you would much rather drown your head in easier craziness.   Sincerly, Puff Pastry   ;-)

      Blogger is acting funny. I can't even access my own page.   Husband and I are very tired after over 12 hours shooting that movie yesterday. It was so hot. It was near 101 F. I got a lot of great pictures while they were shooting. The shots that we saw after everything was done came out very good. I was impressed.   I woke up today, though, and I couldn't keep any food in my stomach, not to mention every time I stood up, I got dizzy. I hate being dizzy.

      I am still very tired. I suppose that whatever this nastiness (for which I have meds) that has crept upon me within the last week could well account for the heavy eyelids, but then so could the meds that do cause drowsiness. We got home at around midnight from a long day...  But it really started Saturday when I stayed up to past midnight because Husband worked sixteen hours for BlogBoy's dad. Then, we awoke at a foggy 7am to try to meet FiveTen at the Lab...but didn't get there until 9am. After gathering FilmSchool Grrl and some breakfast, we were off. I stayed awake for the two hour drive, which is a feat since I am usually sleeping within the first half hour. We finally got to the beach (after getting a wee bit lost and picking up some snacks and lunch) around 1pm. The boys boogie boarded and I let the waves hit me. They were strong, pulling me out and pushing me in. I scraped my leg as I went under, the sand and rocks were sharp. It was fun!! My back is bright red, my shoulders are red, and my legs are red. But, I finally have more color on my skin. I don't glow in the dark anymore.

My interest was peaked when I read that a confessed racist had won by 83%...won what? The opportunity to represent the GOP in the Nov. congressional seat race. Read the article. Shake your head and wonder...where do these stupid who believe this crap live and why would they admit it??

      Rhiannon, the celtic goddess of the moon was a Welch goddess.     The goddess Rhiannon's name meant “Divine Queen” of the fairies. In her  myths, Rhiannon was promised in marriage to an older man she found repugnant. Defying her  family’s wishes that Rhiannon, like other celtic goddesses, declined to marry one of  her "own kind". Instead, the goddess Rhiannon chose the mortal Prince Pwyll  (pronounced Poo-ul or translated as Paul) as her future husband.  Rhiannon appeared to Pwyll one afternoon while he  stood with his companions on a great grass-covered mound in the deep forest surrounding  his castle.  These mounds, called Tors, were  thought to be magical places, perhaps covering the entrance to the otherworld beneath the  earth.  It was thought that those who stood  upon them would become enchanted, so most people avoided them.  So it is no surprise that the young prince was enchanted by the  vision of the beautiful young goddess Rhiannon, who was dressed in glittering gold as she  galloped by on her powerful white horse.  Rhiannon  rode by without sparing him even a glance. Pwyll was intrigued and enraptured, and his  companions were understandably concerned. Ignoring the protest of his friends, Pwyll sent his servant off  riding his swiftest horse to catch her and asked her to return to meet the prince.  But the servant soon returned and reported that  she rode so swiftly that it seemed her horse’s feet scarcely touched the ground and  that he could not even follow her to learn where she went.  The  next day, ignoring his friends’ advice, Pwyll returned alone to the mound and, once  more, the celtic goddess appeared.  Mounted on  his horse, Pwyll pursued her but could not overtake her. Although his horse ran even  faster than Rhiannon's, the distance between them always remained the same.  Finally, after his horse began to tremble with  exhaustion, he stopped and called out for her to wait.    And Rhiannon did.  When Pwyll drew close she teased him gently, telling him that it  would have been much kinder to his horse had he simply called out instead of chasing her.  The goddess Rhiannon then let him know that she  had come to find him, seeking his love. Pwyll welcomed this for the very sight of this beautiful Celtic  goddess had tugged at his heart, and he reached for her reins to guide her to his kingdom.  But Rhiannon smiled tenderly and shook her head,  telling him that they must wait a year and that then she would marry him.  In the next moment, the goddess Rhiannon simply disappeared from him into the deep forest. Rhiannon returned one year later, dressed as before, to greet Pwyll  on the Tor.  He was accompanied by a troop of  his own men, as befitted a prince on his wedding day.   Speaking no words, Rhiannon turned her horse and gestured for the men to  follow her into the tangled woods.  Although  fearful, they complied.  As they rode the  trees suddenly parted before them, clearing a path, then closing in behind them when they passed. Soon they entered a clearing and were joined by a flock of small  songbirds that swooped playfully in the air around Rhiannon’s head.  At the sound of their beautiful caroling all fear  and worry suddenly left the men.  Before long  they arrived at her father’s palace, a stunning site that was surrounded by a lake.  The castle, unlike any they had ever seen, was  built not of wood or stone, but of silvery crystal. It spires soared into the heavens.  After the wedding a great feast was held to celebrate the marriage of  the goddess.  Rhiannon’s family and  people were both welcoming and merry, but a quarrel broke out at the festivities.  It was said that the man she’d once been  promised to marry was making a scene, arguing that she should not be allowed to marry  outside her own people.  Rhiannon slipped away from her husband’s side to deal with the  situation as discreetly as she could . . . using a bit of magic, she turned the persistent  suitor into a badger and caught him in a bag which she tied close and threw into the lake.  Unfortunately, he managed to escape and later  returned to cause great havoc in Rhiannon's life.  The next day Rhiannon left with Pwyll and his men to go to  Wales as his princess.  When they emerged from  the forest and the trees closed behind them, Rhiannon took a moment to glance lovingly  behind her.  She knew that the entrance to the  fairy kingdom was now closed and that she could never return to her childhood home.  But she didn’t pause for long and seemed to  have no regret. The goddess Rhiannon was welcomed by her husband’s people and  admired for her great beauty and her lovely singing.    However, when two full years had passed without her becoming pregnant with  an heir to the throne, the question of her bloodline, her “fitness” to be queen  began to be raised.  Fortunately, in the next year she delivered a fine and healthy son.  This baby, however, was to become the source of  great sorrow for Rhiannon and Pwyll.  As was the custom then, six women servants had been assigned to  stay with Rhiannon in her lying-in quarters to help her care for the infant.  Although the servants were supposed to work in  shifts tending to the baby throughout the night so that the goddess Rhiannon could sleep  and regain her strength after having given birth, one evening they all fell asleep on the  job. When they woke to find the cradle empty, they were fearful they would  be punished severely for their carelessness. They devised a plan to cast the blame on the  goddess Rhiannon, who was, after all, an outsider, not really one of their own people.  Killing a puppy, they smeared its blood on the  sleeping Rhiannon and scattered its bones around her bed.    Sounding the alarm, they accused the goddess of eating her own child.  Although Rhiannon swore her innocence, Pwyll, suffering from  his own shock and grief and faced with the anger of his advisers and the people, did not  come strongly to her defense, saying only that he would not divorce her and asking only  that her life be spared. Rhiannon’s punishment was announced.  For the next seven years the goddess Rhiannon was to sit by the  castle gate, bent under the heavy weight of a horse collar, greeting guests with the story  of her crime and offering to carry them on her back into the castle. Rhiannon bore her humiliating punishment without complaint.  Through the bitter cold of winters and the dusty  heat of four summers, she endured with quiet acceptance.    Her courage was such that few accepted her offer to transport them into the  castle. Respect for her began to spread throughout the country as travelers talked of the  wretched punishment and the dignity with which the goddess Rhiannon bore her  suffering. In the fall of the fourth year three strangers appeared at the  gate—a well-dressed nobleman, his wife, and a young boy.  Rhiannon rose to greet them saying, “Lord, I am here to carry each of you into the Prince’s court, for I have killed my only child and this is my punishment.”  The man, his  wife, and the child dismounted.  While the man  lifted the surprised Rhiannon onto his horse, the boy handed her a piece of an infant’s gown.  Rhiannon saw that it was  cloth that had been woven by her own hands.  The  boy then smiled at her, and she recognized that he had the eyes of his father, Pwyll.   Soon the story was told.  Four  years earlier, during a great storm, the nobleman had been called to the field to help a  mare in labor, when he heard the infant’s cries and found him lying abandoned. He and  his wife took the baby in, raising him as if he were their own. When the rumors of the  goddess Rhiannon’s fate had reached his ears, he realized what had happened and set  out at once to return the child to his parents.  Most  legends suggest that the badger actually was the enraged suitor that Rhiannon had rejected  who had escaped and taken his revenge by kidnapping Rhiannon's infant son. Pwyll and his people quickly recognized the boy for Pwyll and Rhiannon’s son.     The goddess Rhiannon was restored to her honor and her place beside her  husband.  Although she had suffered immensely  at their hands, Rhiannon, goddess of noble traits, saw that they were ashamed and was  filled with forgiveness and understanding.  In some versions of the legend, Rhiannon was the celtic goddess  who later became Vivienne, best known as the Lady of the Lake. She was the celtic goddess  who gave Arthur the sword Excalibur, empowering him to become King in the legends of Camelot.   The story of the celtic goddess Rhiannon reminds us of the healing power of humor, tears,  and forgiveness.  The goddess Rhiannon is a  goddess of movement and change who remains steadfast, comforting us in times of crisis and  of loss.

      I live so far out in the middle of de-civilization that I have to go to three different grocery stores to pick up basic items...one store has ketchup but not Tommy Sauce...the store that has Tommy Sauce doesn't have limes...the store that has limes doesn't have ketchup... Why? None of these stores have an ethnic aisle, either, so finding imported goods (other than wine, and not the good kind) is next to impossible. So frustrating.  Today, I just don't want to get out of bed. I have gotten out of bed but I would rather lie in bed in my pajamas and roll around half-sleeping under the soft covers. *Yawn*
