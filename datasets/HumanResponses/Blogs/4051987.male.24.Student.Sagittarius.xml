      When are we gonna see some action in Boston.... This city has seen some pretty memorable drunken&nbsp;brawls in years past, it's full of Irish after all, and who knows more about pointless violence than the Irish? Wasn't there even&nbsp;a massacre here once? Listen, alls I'm asking for is maybe a&nbsp;fist fight, a knife fight, maybe even a cat fight. Two nicotine starved delegates getting in each others faces on the way to the sidewalk for a quick smoke, or, better yet, Elizabeth Edwards and Teresa Heinz-Kerry go at on stage, that would go a long way to wining the Kerry the Professional Wrestling Fan vote, though, on the other hand, wrestling superstar The Rock is a staunch Republican and he has a lot of clout with the Mullet Wearers of America. Democrats are the nasty ones, why the all of a sudden with the niceness? Have they all of a sudden realised that nobody in their party has a personality any different than an IBM XT and that tends to, oh, alienate the voting public?

      This is my first ever posting on my first ever blog so I'll make sure it's a memorable one, or at least entertaining, though those who know me know it will at least be wholly unbalanced.   So I was watching the Democratic National Convention last night. Nothing but mindless left-wing obsequiosity (hey a new a word, we're making history). Apparently Kerry singlehandedly relieved the embattled Marines at Khe Sahn and cleared the Mekong entirely of Viet Cong armed only with an assault rifle while rescuing American POWs behind enemy lines AND personally advising General Westmoreland on how to conduct the war. He's THAT much of a war hero.&nbsp; And here I am thinking he was just a sailor who had a tour of only a few months on a PT boat and most of whose former colleagues want  urlLink nothing to do with him or his campaign for the presidency   It's interesting how the Democrats are now suddenly proud of a candidates military record. Back in 1996 they tried to dismiss Bob Dole's distinguisahed World War II service record, a record much more distinguished than Kerry's piddling 4 month "tour" in Vietnam. Dole lost the use of his right arm, Clinton committed a felony and dodged the draft, yet that was okay. Bush was at least in the military and the Democrats bash him for not actually being in combat, need I point out how hypocritical this is.  Democrats make me sick. They are the political equivilant of plutonium nails scratching&nbsp;a uranium chalkboard.&nbsp; They're both unwelcome and quite dangerous. They must be stopped, and the only way that can happen is to  urlLink Re-Elect President Bush   Watching that Convention did make yearn for the good ol' days of '68.. Being a mere lad of 24 I of course have no first hand recollection of that party in swingin' Chicago, but I'm sure the geriatric among you remember when Boss Daley got Chicago's finest to crack a few hippie heads... Well, those hippies grew up and now, in 2004 they're INSIDE the convention, this time being held in Boston. My, times have changed.
