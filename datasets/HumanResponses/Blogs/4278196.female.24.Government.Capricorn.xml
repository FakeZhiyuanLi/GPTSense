      My office has never been noisy, that's for a fact. It borders between deathlike silence or funeral-like hushness. Occasionally when my DD (aka my boss) has one of his funny bone gone haywire, we'd have bursts of laughter and chortles.   But that's about all. Well, sometimes, the silence is kinda scary. It's like you can practically hear everything around you. That's why I tend to type loudly on my keyboard. Creation of sound in the absence of noise. (and to show I'm not skiving, though typing a blog during office hours is definitely SKIVE behavior)  Have any of you read Dan Brown's books? Read his famous (or infamous) Da Vinci's Code, and am now reading his Digital Fortress. Think the former makes a better read. Digi Fortress reads something like a half-hearted attempt to create suspense. (Although I admit Dan is good at making twists....but his twists are kinda pathetic). I compare him with other good Sci Fic writers like Philip Kerr..both of them back up their writings with some form of research. I've always like walking on the edges...some form of pseudo-reality fiction. (Haha)  My hubby (shameless me, I'm not even married yet) that it's kinda odd to write a blog. Who is the audience anyway? In a conventional diary, the audience is presumably yourself (unless you LOVE and expect other people to pry open your writings). But on the internet, the audience is practically everyone. Yet you are so AFRAID your blog will one day return to slap you. Just look at those poor chaps who revealed too much at the wrong time.   So it's kinda strange isn't it? I've read blogs which practically divulge EVERYTHING abt the writer, and blogs which are basically info-sharing, or porn. Whatever. The basic point is: it's still odd. But in our "internet-age", odd is no longer a word in the (online) dictionary.  Well, I like typing anyway, and blogging allows me freedom of thought and speech, without the need to structure or organise thoughts. Free flow, you'd say. Yeah, suppose so. I tend to write emails this way too. Drift here, drift there.   And of cos, blogs tend to serve the needs of exhibitionists. Or closet exhibitionist. Everyone has a streak of that in them. The need to show off, to shout to the world: "Hey, can't you see I'm so important?"

       Can you imagine something so silly? My sis and her darling boyfriend were so SHY to see my and my hubby that they actually ATTEMPTED to hide their faces on the bus?! goodness. what is THERE to be afraid of anyway?      Oh well, I do think her bfren has her characteristics. That's why they click, maybe.       On to another topic. Read about HDB regulations (to CS: thank you dear for helping me with that), heaved a sigh of relief when I realised that we do not need to fork out ALOT of CPF or cash for payment. Whew..      A very HOT day today. and I meant REAL hot. think the temperature went up to 35 deg C or so in the afternoon. Yuks. Hopefully it POURS tomorrow. I love the rain, it gives one the sense of protection. I feel enclosed and sheltered by water on all sides when I stand with a big umbrella along the roads. I HATE or rather fear lightning though. That pure bolt of electricity...it's completely scary. Of cos, they are spectacular when u look at them from a safe distance. But I always found lightnings angry expressions of a rainstorm.       Have to work tomorrow. Sigh. Or rather, just feeling lethargic. My work is ok. I love it. It suits me, but still I'd rather spend more time on my sleep.

       Hmm..am blogging from my office's PC...some functions are not appearing. oh well.  It's Saturday, and can u believe I'm STILL in office? (Nono, I'm not complaining, I work till 5pm on Sats, but the pace is MUCH slower on weekends) :)  Read Psycho's blog abt me, haha...wellwell, Psycho, people DO grow up, in case you haven't notice. Doesn't mean your object of attention is young, you are still 18 right? Oh, and I hope W doesn't read abt THAT line in your blog! He's a sweet guy. Unfortunately, you hit the nail on the head. I've stopped loving him ever since I got attached to him like 6 months? Why I still hang around is cos, basically, he is JUST too nice. Coupled with that is an inertia to look around. Just can't find someone matching. Until I met CS :) Coincidentally, he's very much the alpha male, like yourself. That's why a Gamma female like me is attracted to him. However, unlike yourself, he doesn't have harebrained ideas to run off into some godforsaken place to look for a godforsaken insect :P (offended? good) :P He has W's stability with your strength. So of course, what's the next course to take but to make sure he is MINE? :P (ever the possessive little cat)  Had to present to a bunch of rowdy JC (am not telling which, but it starts with C) students this morning, as usual, they remind me I am getting on in years. Argh, why am I still moaning abt my AGE???? (someone IS older than me..MANY someones) :P  This week has been kinda hectic and yet relaxed. Was off work for a week to attend 2 courses. But work piled up as they have a habit of doing while I am away. Haven't got to slaughtering the whole pile yet. sigh.....

       My FIRST blog. I've always known people who blogged, read abt people who blogged..but I think the catalyst was having access to Psycho's blog (*thank you!*)      My darling has just left my house. Missed him terribly. Am going to wed him in a year's time. Even though we've only known each other like 5 months. 5 months..but seem like 5 decades. It's amusing, comforting and sometimes, scary, to be able to read his mind, and have him read mine. I suppose that's what people meant by finding one's "soul mate".      Used to be sceptical abt such concepts. Am not an idealist..but now, I stand converted. :)       The bursting of Light from Shadows...hmm...kinda describe my feelings over the past few months...
