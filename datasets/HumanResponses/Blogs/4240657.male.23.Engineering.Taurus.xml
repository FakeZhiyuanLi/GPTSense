       urlLink    What happen? Are you capturing photo? While I like to take photo in a more nature feel mode. Standing there and prepared everything and say cheese type is not my cup of tea.  Posted by Stanley Ooi

       urlLink    Emily and Winnie. From what I know, Winnie is a pretty and famous girl among the pack of friends. Her flowers suppose to be in light purple but the florist somehow bully her, because the flowers never look very beautiful. Anyway, the prettiness of both girls should steal the focus point from the flowers.  Posted by Stanley Ooi
