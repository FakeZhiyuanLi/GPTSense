      Well the sons of bitches at my previous hosting company decided to suspend my account this morning. With no warning at all, they have stopped all access to my site at bhell13.co.uk It seems I havnt paid my bill which used to be £26 a year, they didnt send me a warning that my account was about to expire or anything, and I cant renew my account cos they have stopped that deal. Its now £49 a year for a standard hosting account!!! So im looking for a new host, but im tempted to jack it all in and leave the internet alone...

       urlLink Skype has just gone 1.0  For all those not in the know, its a killer app. that allows you to talk just like on the phone  [broadband, mic and headphones/speakers required]  to your mates or family who also have d/l'd the app.  Like a vocal messenger program if you will. If you have lots of online buddies and wanna chat with them instead of typing,  urlLink check it out.   FYI l33t speak and smilies can still be sent via a little built in text messenger. w00t! :)    urlLink

        [excuse]  The reason I havnt posted properly here in ages is due to a very addictive drug I have been enjoying recently called "Spider-Man 2 on the PS2"   [/excuse]   Having completed Spidey 2 at the weekend I will now have to think of another reason/excuse to continue to shun my massive readership of 3 people. Sorry guys, but I have nothing interesting to talk about, just geeky crap about dvd burners, Firefox and my new online dvd rental subscription, which can be read at much better blogs such as  urlLink Mr Torrez's   Move along!

      A man has decided to sue Rockstar (Formerly DMA Design) for stealing the  urlLink GTA  idea from him - about six years after release.  Interestingly, the article doesn't mention that GTA was originally intended as an Amiga game to be released in '95, but was dropped for the PC and PSX, due to the declining Amiga market.  &lt;pedantry&gt;The BBC also manages to show it can't tell the difference between GTA - the game in question - and GTA3 - a much later fully-3D sequel.&lt;/pedantry&gt;

      ... the guy who wrote : (Ninja's) are actually silent assasins.  e.g.  they would dress up like a salesman to get into your house, and while they are pretending to sell you something they would look for holes and cracks to climb into, then at night they would come back and murder you.  They wouldn't just kill you on the spot.  The Best Ninja's ever (TM) includes how you could improve films just by adding ninjas. IE Perfect Storm is about "Sword Fishermen" and then it's got badly ps'd ninja's on the boat with George. *Very* funny...

I can back up my hypothesis with these two facts :   FACT ONE : If all the women in the world switched on their vibrators at the same time, the earth would be knocked off it's spinny axis thing, and collide with the moon.  FACT TWO : When all flights were banned inbound into the states on September 12th 2001 the average daily temperature all around the word went up by a degree during the day, and down by a degree at night.  This fascinating fact is because the amount of vapour and contrails all the passenger flights produce absorb lots of heat from the sun in the day, etc... etc... (~Thanks to  urlLink Mr. J. Clarkson  for that!)   See...?? Come to New Links for the humour, and each day leave a little bit wiser, thanks to me, and my profound facts.... :)

Although I don't know why I'm laughing - there are obviously millions of idiots who do open the attachments which can be seen by how rapidly these buggers spread.    Anyway after my antivirus software updated this morning it identified them as mimail.s - apparently it pops up a dialog box and prompts for credit card details. Ooh had a lucky escape there - I of course would have entered my credit card details into any old random box that popped up.

      YA another bookmarklet thing &quot; urlLink I like! &quot; is actually quite useful. You maintain a list of your favourite links (simple one click thing like posting to blogspot) but the neat thing is it will give you lists of sites that other people have recommended by examining other lists that have similar entries to yours.

         getHTMLForIcon("football"); -->   Nobby is  urlLink off  for a pittance to Villa although the story does mention a third club involved so we may be able to screw a few more pennies for him. However much we finally get for him it won't be enough.     We  urlLink play Villa away on 17 th  April . Fiver on Nobby for first goal?     EDIT:  No third club mentioned - either text of story has changed or I read it wrong :)

      Follow up from the reclassification stuff...  urlLink Bob Marley  died in 1981. It says so on our office calender for today.   The fact that he actually died on Monday 11th May doesn't seem to bother the makers of said calendar.   A stern letter is going to the manufacturers - Randon Non Date Related Facts Calendars Inc.  Q.

(If you are a hifi buff it'll really test your system's timing, but I digress... these albums rock!)  Second thing was, I need to revise my list of top ten games...    urlLink 1080&deg; Snowboarding    urlLink FFVII   Dunno how I forgot Final Fantasy, and 1080&deg; is just the finest game...   Still can't justify putting Revs in there, but it wins the award for Funniest Game Character Name Ever &trade;   Prize for the first New Linker who can guess who I'm thinking of!!

         getHTMLForIcon("boobies"); -->   A collection of  urlLink Tijuana Bibles . And in anticipation of the next question, an excerpt from the FAQ.    What is a Tijuana Bible?   Tijuana Bibles (AKA eight-pagers, bluesies) are small (~2x5") illustrated pornographic tracts printed primarily before 1960. The skimpy stories usually framed contemporary movie, sports, political, or cartoon/comic book stars in absurdly hyperbolic sexual situations.     Most bibles consisted of 8 stapled pages. Sometimes you'd get a bonus frame from another title on the back cover, probably a printing mistake. Some were printed in a larger format with 16 pages. Page counts vary, but most stick with the tried and true 8-pager format.     I've never seen a "color" bible. Inside pages are black and white (or shades of such), with an occasional splash of red outlining on the cover.      The "artistic" quality is usually poor-- most feature atrocious grammar with illustrations just good enough to tweak a sexual response. (There are notable exceptions, of course!)

      and a colour change for good measure!    The comments are by  urlLink HaloScan  (as mentioned to me by  urlLink ILuvNufc  the other night). I'll give these a go and see what they are like. I've finally decided to add a comments thing to this after not doing any development work recently on the new New Links site. Why? I bought  urlLink Morrowind: GOTY  for the Xbox the other day!

      Yes,i do agree this is rather silly.      You're  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe !   by C.S. Lewis     You were just looking for some decent clothes when everything changed quite dramatically. For the better or for the worse, it is still hard to tell. Now it seems like winter will never end and you feel cursed. Soon there will be an epic struggle between two forces in your life and you are very concerned about a betrayal that could turn the balance. If this makes it sound like you're re-enacting Christian theological events, that may or may not be coincidence. When in doubt, put your trust in zoo animals.

            You're  Love in the Time of Cholera !   by Gabriel Garcia Marquez     Like Odysseus in a work of Homer, you demonstrate undying loyalty by sleeping with as many people as you possibly can. But in your heart you never give consent! This creates a strange quandary of what love really means to you. On the one hand, you've loved the same person your whole life, but on the other, your actions barely speak to this fact. Whatever you do, stick to bottled water. The other stuff could get you killed.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .

      Apparently I'm a Jurassic Park sort of guy. Bloomin' load of crap that is.       You're  Jurassic Park !   by Michael Crichton     You combine all the elements of a mad scientist, a brash philosopher, a humble researcher, and a money-hungry attracter of tourists. With all these features, you could build something monumental or get chased around by your own demons. Probably both, in fact. A movie based on your life would make millions, and spawn at least two sequels thatwouldn't be very good. Be very careful around islands.

      I'm Ulysses apparently. My results:         You're  Ulysses !   by James Joyce     Most people are convinced that you don't make any sense, but compared to what else you could say, what you're saying now makes tons of sense. What people do understand about you is your vulgarity, which has convinced people that you are at once brilliant and repugnant. Meanwhile you are content to wander around aimlessly, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. What you see is vast, almost limitless, and brings you additional fame. When no one is looking, you dream of being a Greek folk hero.     Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .

      This  urlLink game  is not the Railroad Tycoon sim but is in fact a version of Pipemania with trains. Actually I vaguely remember a game like this on the C64 or Spectrum.

       urlLink   The  urlLink BBC  is reporting an email scam aimed at MBNA customers. I received one yesterday but it got diverted into my spam bucket so I didn't see it until just now. It's very crude technically. It embeds a gif file (click thumbnail to the left for full size) which looks like a normal marketing HTMLised email (even down to the bad grammar!) which looks like it has a valid link in the standard blue, underlined text. The whole gif is in fact a clickthrough to the spoofed login site.    What concerns me most about this is how exactly have the phishers got the email addresses of MBNA customers? I smell a breach of the Data Protection Act. I'll give them a ring tomorrow and see what they say.

      I can't believe mmChronic has invited the whole of the local population to our night oot. The clever thing would have been to say that nobody is invited.

By the way, if anyone is reading this, mmChronic will be the one sitting next to the three good looking blokes.   Wassup with Halo?   As Halo is down I'll just post my comments here...

We had a strong starting round (2nd place out of about 12-14 teams), but we then went "all crap". What riled me even more than usual was the fact that there were some filthy students who commited the following nefarious deeds:   Bought one drink each and sat with same drink all night  Started out with four members in their team. Their ranks slowly swelled to eight by the time the quiz started. The "file size limit" on each team was imposed at six members at the start of the quiz.  Used mobile phones to ring up their filthy "mates" for the answers (not even sneaking off to the toilets or anything)  Won the jackpot question with a lucky guess and walked off home with more money than they all came in with put together.  And one of them didn't have the decency to even smoke her tabs properly.  Fuskers.

      According to this  urlLink post at Ben Brown  his ex-company sold it's hardware when it went bust to Blogger. He made sure he wiped his nads over the hardware - and some of those servers are now running BlogSpot. ewww.    Of course it doesn't beat Gazza's famous genital wiping incident. Apparently just before the France World Cup, Gazza and several other England players were apparently left alone with the Jules Rimet cup. Gazza is alleged to have wiped his bellend all over the globe bit at the top of the cup. So of course when you see the clips of people like Le Bouef, Viera et al kissing the cup they are in fact kissing a fine layer of Geordie smeg. Post a link to the story please - although of course it may well be an urban legend but that won't stop me repeating it as fact.

There are a plethora of other statistical benchmarks on the site but unfortunately without any comprehension of the systems used the results are meaningless to me. But that should raise our score a bit.    pinched from  urlLink Presurfer .

Then you'll probably be right at home with some classic  urlLink text adventures . The site has 6 playable online so far.    The first one is  Adventure (or Colossal Cave). The very first time I played with a computer it was to play this at a very poorly attended computer exhibition thing in St Theresa's school when I was about 11/12. I say poorly attended - there was a bearded bloke who was running it, 3 computers (Apples I believe but I'm not going to swear to it) and me who only wandered in on the way home from Heaton Park. I spent ages playing this adventure and was hooked on computers from that point onwards.    The others on the site are Atari Adventure, Rogue, Zork I, II &amp; III.

So to make up for it here is the homepage of an emulator called  urlLink Hob  that has 19 games playable on the site with a fair degree of overlap with my list yesterday. But what if you wanted to play one of the games that was on the list yesterday but not on Hob's? Well then you go to the site of  urlLink JX Speccy  which has 5,500 (count 'em) games online. They even have  urlLink Moon Cresta  for ILuvNufc. I think that should make up for it. Sorry!

      In a shameless bid to wrest the multipost title back I'm going to be inspired by  urlLink the friday five  which lists 5 questions on a Friday which you are supposed to answer and list on your blog.    All well and good but I believe Friday should be used more productively so here is New Links Friday 10 - 10 Spectrum (or Timex if you're American) games for you to play in your browser. Yay.     urlLink Ant Attack     urlLink Batty     urlLink Chaos     urlLink Chuckie Egg     urlLink Elite  (that's the last we'll see of Bungers)    urlLink Manic Miner     urlLink Jet Set Willy     urlLink Lords of Midnight     urlLink Scuba Dive     urlLink Zynaps     There are other Spectrum games to play at the homesite of  urlLink Jasper , a Speccy emulator.  For all the Spectrum stuff you could wobble a  urlLink memory expansion pack  at check out  urlLink World Of Spectrum  which has emulators, more games (but none by  urlLink Ultimate !),  urlLink programming  documentation,  urlLink manuals  and lots of other stuff.  urlLink Planet Sinclair  has a lot of information on Sinclair products and is a good read.    You may also want to read reviews of the games (or just relive your youth!) in  urlLink Crash  or  urlLink Your Sinclair .     All hail the mighty  urlLink Clive .    Ooh look - 10 links to games, 10 various other  bits of linkage + the main link to the Friday 5 site makes erm... 21. Result.

See I love lots of american things... after all, they gave us the  urlLink Hollywood  and  urlLink Carmen Electra . They also invented the  urlLink SawFish , which is the worlds first underwater chainsaw wielding robot. It cuts down trees that have been submerged under lakes behind  urlLink dams . Speaking of chainsaw wielders, anyone who's seen the front cover of  urlLink Edge  this month will  see they got some coverage of  urlLink Resident Evil 4  (or  urlLink Biohazard 4  as it's called in Japan).  urlLink Capcom  established the "survival horror" genre with the release of the  urlLink first Resi  game in 1996. Hand's up if you remember  urlLink Alone in the Dark  - the game that kicked it all off in 1992. And that should put me in the  urlLink Guinness   urlLink Book of Records . ;)

         getHTMLForIcon('death'); -->   There have been rumours that  urlLink Kurt Cobain , the  urlLink Nirvana  frontman, was murdered knocking about since his death.  urlLink CobainWasKilled.com  seems to think so. They say they will be revealing the truth between March 16 th  and April 3 rd .     They are doing this via a series of questions. Amongst their clues are the fact there was a similar episode of  urlLink Law and Order  (script written by  urlLink this ?), a  urlLink Siskel &amp; Ebert  (WTF!?) review of the case apparently came up with a 3 thumbs down for murder and  urlLink Courtney Love 's latest album not selling because Nirvana fans aren't buying it.     The last clue is of course ignoring totally the fact that the stuff she does is crap! That and the  urlLink increasingly   urlLink erratic   urlLink behaviour  means no one is interested in Courtney Love anymore which is presumably the reason her behaviour is getting ever more bizarre  urlLink even going so far as to accuse  rocker  urlLink Ted Nugent  of paedophilia. Of course she may be telling the truth about this but the strange way she revealed it included 'phoning the  urlLink Howard Stern  show, then going in and spilling the beans.    For more on Cobain's death check out  urlLink JusticeForkurt.com  which has a lot more background info.    /regains New Links multipost record with ease - 14 links :)

      As mentioned in the comments on this  urlLink post  I promised an exploding whale and that's just what you've got. QT movie in 2 sizes -  urlLink 3Mb  &amp  urlLink 11Mb .    Synopsis: a whale is found dead on beach &amp; local town too cheap to get rid of it properly so they stick half a ton of dynamite inside it instead. What they weren't expecting was the deluge of huge chunks of whale blubber (leave sound on - you have to hear the sound of falling whale lumps at least once in your life) - big enough to destroy cars they landed on.     I love the smell of exploded whale in the morning.

But it gets better - today  urlLink Waxy.org  have a piece about the author of the software - and his self-confessed mental problems, links to Holocaust denial postings he put on Usenet &amp the death threats he has made!

      Morning all! Nothing on the TV last night, so I had a chance to do some preparation for today's award-winning post for the award-winning  NewLinks . I thought I'd bring you a round up of this week's science news, and a selection of interesting stuff from elsewhere around the ol' interweb. The science news is all skanked from the excellent  urlLink New Scientist  website. After all, they do say that it's where the  real  news exists these days. We'll have none of your vacuous weekly celebrity worshipping, or political tittle-tattle round here.   Anyway, on with the linkage...       getHTMLForIcon('jeebus'); -->    Let's kick off with this story about an  urlLink expedition  that will set off to Turkey in the summer with the aim of finding Noah's Ark. Fair enough, you might think, but they're going to investigate "what they believe to be a mammoth structure some 45 feet high, 75 feet wide and up to 450 feet long that was exposed in part by last summer's heat wave in Europe". Chuck in the obligatory conspiracy theory, in 1957 Turkish air force pilots spotted a boat-shaped formation in the Agri province. The government did not pursue the sighting, as the entire area, including Mount Ararat, was off limits to foreigners because of Soviet complaints that explorers were U.S. spies - and you've got the makings of the next Indiana Jones film. Mr. Spielberg, you know where to find me.  And if running around on a mountain is not quite  your  bag, why not try running around chasing after UFOs in Iran. It seems flying saucer fever has gripped Iran after dozens of sightings in the last few days. Read more about it  urlLink here .       getHTMLForIcon('mars'); -->      getHTMLForIcon('robot'); -->    We also haven't had much news from mars lately, so here's a quick check on the progress of the rovers.  urlLink Spirit sets a personal best and Opportunity nears next target .  Staying on Mars for a moment, the funniest page title of the day must go to  urlLink this one  which tells you all about NASA's plans for the next mars expedition.        getHTMLForIcon('wotw'); -->    Movie News : This looks like it will either be really good, or really, really weak. It's  urlLink 'The Day After Tomorrow' , and it's got Jake Gyllenhall in it. He's the kid in Donny Darko. Any way, the movie's about what would happen if there was some kind of mega storm that obliterates the world and sends us all back into the Ice age. Kind of like what would happen if there was a nuclear winter I suppose.   And that's exactly what you might get when you discover        that we (Europe) could be in  urlLink nuclear disarray  as our borders push east and we have the inclusion of the ten new countries that are joining us tomorrow. I, for one, welcome our new Lithuanian overlords.       getHTMLForIcon('robot'); -->    Anyway, I digress. If the Lithuanian strippers don't get us all (fingers crossed), maybe the  urlLink robot traffic cones  will. That's right, herds of robotic traffic cones could soon be swarming onto the A1, closing down lanes and slowing the traffic. Check this out though - each fleet of robots is made up of a lead robot or "shepherd", which is equipped with a GPS satellite receiver, plus a number of less expensive "dumb" units. The shepherd takes up its position, and tells the other road cones where to go. I, for one, welcome our new conical overlords.        getHTMLForIcon('robot'); -->    Robot news story number #3 features a robot, who this time, is armed with a  urlLink superglue gun . But instead of fixing things around the house this one "could finger bomb suspects". Not what you want first thing in the morning.  It seems that when a bomb disposal robot destroys a suspicious package, crucial evidence that could trap the would-be bombers can be lost forever. Again, more interesting stuff from the ol'  urlLink New Scientist .  And if super glue won't fix it, how about a nice bit of soldering action? That's right kids; scientists have added the trusty  urlLink soldering iron  to their nano-toolkits. They've created an atomic-scale conveyor belt that may also be the smallest soldering iron ever created. The new device, which ferries molten metal, is made from carbon nanotubes just 20 millionths of a millimetre in diameter. I think that's even smaller than a grain of sand! Woo-yay! That  is  small!  That should keep y'all going for the next five minutes...

Well it is tomorrow actually but the celebrations take place on the night before - like Christmas Eve for pagans &amp; wiccans. Probably.     Religious question of the day - how do pagans know how to do their ceremonies? They seem to be all based on these ancient holiday dates which are all pre Roman. If this is the case there are no written records from that time so the pagans must either be guessing what went on or they must be in possession of the oldest British documents. Ever. You decide.    I'm off to dance around a fire, making up a quasi religion as I go.

Unfortunately for Bungers it's a US organisation.    It looks like multiple partner orgies are off the menu though - according to the mission statement above they will only provide it  urlLink discretely .     via  urlLink boingboing

      Take  urlLink the test  to see if you can tell the difference.  I got 6 out of 10 which means...   It was 50-50, and that's how well you've done.

I was going to put the poll directly in the post but Blogger doesn't seem to allow Javascript in main posts anymore. Shizzle.

If you didn't own an Amiga you may not have heard of this crew but they did some lovely little intros.  It seems they even do web design now and their  urlLink design site  has some more nice flash anims including a very good version of &quot; urlLink I Feel Fine &quot;   via  urlLink linkfilter

      The new comment count code has been rewritten once again.  urlLink I said I'd fixed it for Mozilla  and I had. Sort of. I've been using Firefox more and more and noticed that when there had been a lot of comments to read ones I'd already read would appear unread after I read few more.  It turns out this is due to a limit to the number cookies you can dump on a machine from 1 address. IE suffered the same thing but it seemed to have a much higher number of cookies allowed so it took longer to see the effect of it. I thought this might have been a problem when I  urlLink first wrote the new comment code  so I had a half idea how I was going to do it anyway.  So I've dumped  urlLink Bill Dortch's  cookie library and got hold of Stephen Chapman's cookie library from  urlLink Felgall . This one has built in array handling so I'm storing all the comment counts in one array which gets stored in 1 cookie. I also now set the cookie when you enter the page the comments are on. Previously it was in the 'onclick' property of the link to the page. This meant it was only set when you clicked the link from the main or archive pages. If you came in through the 'Previous Posts' link or from a search then the cookie wasn't being set. That's sorted now so new comment counts should reflect whatever you have read regardless of how you got there.  The next problem I can see is when the cookie gets too large and you can't write any more info to it. I think it has a 4Kb limit. That's plenty of comment counts though so we shouldn't hit that too fast. I know how I am going to do it but I'll worry about that if/when we hit the limit.   Right I know most of you fell asleep 3 paragraphs ago but this bit is important. If the new comment count isn't working delete your cookies for this site - you may have reached your limit and the new fangled one can't be created. It may also be that you are caching an old version of the page without the new code (this happened quite a bit during debugging) so you may want  to try the New Links patented  urlLink Anti Green Screen Key&trade;

      We have been getting loads of hits for  urlLink this page  through people searching Google for the aforementioned 10000 games. After I'd posted this link  urlLink ILuvNufc  pointed out it was a massively expensive paysite where they wanted you dialup a UK premium phone number at a cost of &pound;1.50 per minute. Ignoring the fact that most of us here aren't using modems and a lot of our visitors are from overseas anyway, it's a bit on the expensive side when there are so many free flash games to be found on the net. Where? Here are a few  free  game sites we've featured:   urlLink LucasFan Games (not Flash but still free)    urlLink The Flash Games.com    urlLink Nothing To Do?    urlLink 2 Flash Games (they've got more than 2!)    urlLink Dizzy: The Collection   We've featured many more than this - have a look through the archives listed in the right panel.  And to finish off with one last blast at 10000Games. I've just been for a look at their site to ensure I got the pricing right ( urlLink sorry if that's being anal dogs !) and the latest game added at the time of writing was one called Skater Boy. I happened to notice the character in the thumbnail looked like one of the characters in Ed, Edd and Eddie which is a cartoon my daughter watches on  urlLink Cartoon Network . So I went to their site and funnily enough they have a skateboard game called &quot;To the Ed-streme&quot; featuring the same graphics. So we have a choice of   Cartoon Network have licenced their game for use to 10000Games knowing it is an incredibly expensive service which is probably out of the financial reach of Cartoon Network's target demographic. Not only that they have even allowed them to change the name of the game.  10000Games have ripped off Cartoon Network.  You decide. In case you need any help with the decision the two pictures are partial screenshots of the websites - click on them for bigger shots.  urlLink    Cartoon Network's version  urlLink    10000Games' version

      Although the location of Springfield is still a mystery, an accurate map of the town itself exists. The  urlLink Guide to Springfield USA  has a very detailed map of all the locations you could think of. They've done this by mapping the relative locations of buildings etc as seen during episodes of The Simpsons and have ended up with a map in 9 large sections. I'm still trying to find the Simpsons' house.

      We've had international swearing before featuring a  urlLink Welsh swear page  and a truly  urlLink global swearpage .  We've even had the  urlLink mother-of-all swearword collections . But we haven't had a guide to  urlLink international obscene hand gestures . That's that sorted then.  The page features the English V sign including a lovely picture of the  urlLink Thatchbitch  telling her adoring masses to piss off. It's a bit fuzzy on the history of the sign though. I always thought it was first used after the battle of  urlLink Agincourt . This was supposedly due to the practice of the French cutting off the draw fingers of any  urlLink English longbowmen  they captured which then made it a little  urlLink difficult to use a longbow . The English archers &quot;gave the Vs&quot; en-masse to the advancing French just to let them know they were ready for action.  Remember kids - swearing  is  big and it  is  clever. It's part of your history. Yay!    via  urlLink The Flophouse

       Here's a toon fan site -  urlLink Serwis Newcastle United  from Poland. It's full of transfer gossip like this interesting(?) snippet: ?rodkowy obro?ca Bordeaux Marco Caneira znalaz? si? w orbicie zainteresowa? dzia?aczy Newcastle. Woo? Yay? Probably? New Links will of course provide translation on request via the multilingual ILuvNufc who has picked up a smattering of Polish during his exhaustive trawls of Eastern European sites whilst looking for Blink 182 bootlegs.  Of more interest to the non Polish speakers here may be the  urlLink goal videos  and  urlLink image  gallery.  Minor quibble here. They also have a  urlLink Legends  page, or Legendy as we cosmopolitan European Unionists might say, which has some real toon legends. And Barry Venison. Now don't get me wrong I liked Bad Back Bazzer a lot but he's not really a legend is he? Or did I miss something? He's just not in the same League as God, Wor Jackie, KK, Pedro, Shack, Wyn the Leap, Gazza, Sausage Packer and quite a few more. Maybe he got extra points for his lovely hair and waistcoats? ;)

           urlLink Denounce Newswire  are reporting that Mikey is going to ensure his latest film,  urlLink Fahrenheit 911 , gets to the widest possible audience by releasing it via the BitTorrent network. &quot;This film deserves the widest possible distribution,&quot; said Moore, whose film won the Palme D'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival this past weekend. &quot;I had hoped I could achieve that with Miramax and Disney, but such was not to be the case. I'm thrilled to announce that I have an even better solution. BitTorrent!&quot; Except he didn't.

       urlLink Knacker Factor  is a viral marketing site for ProPlus. So why would we be interested? Because it has a sleep quality quiz and when you fill it in you get a graph telling you how tired you are through the day. Which is probably way more scientific than my method of counting how many times I fall asleep in any given hour!

      This is an old one but I looked at it for the first time last night.  urlLink BlogShares - Fantasy Blog Share Market  is like  urlLink CelebDaq  except you trade on Blogs rather than celebrities. There is loads more information available than there is/was with CelebDaq. In fact it's like the Championship Manager of share dealing games as it has everything you could possibly want to know about your share deals etc.  You get B$500 to start off with and, if you claim your  urlLink blog , you get 1000 of the 5000 shares in that. Each link in/out of a blog has a value with links to/from popular sites worth more than those from sites with 1 reader. I piled my virtual cash into the  urlLink Bellavista Juventud  site we featured yesterday. At the time I invested it only showed our link to it and I knew the link from  urlLink SpaceHardware  would show up soon plus any others that had been made thus increasing it's value. I hope that doesn't count as insider trading! I should probably read the rules... one day. Oh well if I get caught I can always pull a  urlLink Saunders .

      Whilst reading  urlLink Stephen Newton's blog , which we've  urlLink mentioned here  before, I saw a link to a new project of his - The  urlLink Museum of Spam .  It's a neat idea. Using the  urlLink email to Blogger feature  Stephen is publishing all the spam he receives at the address for that blog. This is then published in all it's nasty HTML glory. All e-mails to stephennewton.mofs@blogger.com are posted here uncensored. Anyone is free to pass judgement on them... or whatever. Repeating the email address here can only help boost the crap he gets.  One thought does spring to mind. It could be easily hijacked by unscrupulous bloggers trying to boost their linkbacks. All they'd have to do is email stuff containing their URL, this would then be indexed as a linkback by  urlLink Technorati ,  urlLink Blogpulse ,  urlLink BlogDex ,  urlLink Google  etc etc. I'm off to run a mass mailer.

       urlLink Star Wars  opened this day in 1977. Which might have been a good thing if it wasn't for the fact that it made George Lucas really rich and made him think he could interfere with the production of a film until he turned it shite.

          New icons for usage. That's 3 (Dibnah, Mr T &amp; Science) from Bungers and 1 (toon) from Merg. Have I missed any?  I've also changed the search box to use Feedster. This searches the feeds for a site rather than the site itself which has 2 major advantages over Google:  Results always point at post (either the new permalink style or the old) and not just to an archive page.  Our posts seem get into the Feedster search database quicker than they did with Google.

Interesting factette buried away in that article. It seems men are at increasing risk of breast cancer. I suspect this is just a sneaky way we men use to get male cancer research spending increased. I don't know numbers off the top of my head (so I could be talking complete rubbish here) but I remember reading that many more men die of testicular cancer than women die of breast cancer yet breast cancer treatment funding is significantly higher than that of testicular cancer. I blame these wimmin's groups. New Links says 'Equal opportunities for bollocks'!  This place is turning into the fscking  urlLink Lancet . I'm off to find some 8008135.

The Island existed until the 1860's, until it was dredged to allow shipping upriver, and bigger ships to be launched from the yards on the Newcastle side of the Tyne. What price progress, eh? We would've had another pub to go to at lunchtime if it wasn't for those pesky industrialists! "this area was a rural riverscape, the main feature being the King's Meadows a 30 acre island. Complete with a Pub, the Countess of Coventry, the island was a popular festival venue for horse racing and regattas and the landlady kept cows to supply the village of Elswick with milk."

      Because he enjoyed the  urlLink Da Vinci code  so much he might be interested in the  urlLink news of a talk that Dan Brown gave . The sequel is about Free Masons and is set in Washington. I wonder if it'll explain the  urlLink masonic symbols on the US Dollar . The article doesn't say when it'd due but apparently there is a clue on the cover of the  urlLink Da Vinci code  which gives some information about the new book.  He also said he left out what he felt would be the most controversial plot device - not for fear of it's controversy but because he felt it was &quot;flimsy&quot;. So what was so controversial? He was going to have Jesus surviving the crucifuxion. Which reminds me of something I've been trying to find out for ages.  I remember reading a sci-fi book as a fairly young child (9-10) where a Jewish scientist goes back in time, discovers Jesus is a retard and takes his place. He then goes through lots of the things mentioned in the Bible and ultimately gets crucified. Does anyone know what this book is and who wrote it?   via  urlLink boingboing

The reason it is going to get used here is of paramount importance to the net's premier cheapskates - it means  FREE  hi-res image storage! YAY!  A  urlLink full tutorial  is available at Blogger. But the basic premise is download and install a chat gizmo called  urlLink Hello , choose send picture, then choose BloggerBot as the recipient. You will then get an option screen for resizing,captioning etc. Once you have done that, choose publish to blog and off it goes. The picture is published as a thumbnail which is a link through to the full size picture.  When resizing images for the thumbnail choose one of the two smaller sizes for publishing as the largest size will probably screw the layout of the page. As for the size of the stored hi-res image choose the largest. After all we aren't paying for the hosting! ;)   CAVEAT:  I haven't looked at privacy implications yet re spyware etc as I had to have a fiddle with it straight away. I'll be going back to the Hello page to have a read soon.  ps. Bungers was going to have a look at this and write something but there are several reasons I've done it instead.  I couldn't wait to have a play  We would be waiting for months for him to do it ;)  Most importantly of all he is doing the Victoria Tunnel Report tonight. Parp!

      This site has a form to fill in which generates a link, which you send to someone runing AIM and when they click on it their away  urlLink message can be set to what you like .  It's a shame that this only works in AIM as I don't know any AOLers.

        Gather round kids, and I'll tell you all a story...   Back in the dark days before iPod, there was this computator called the  urlLink Mac SE . It used to look like  urlLink this . Now  you  can experience computing as it once was!  urlLink Wired  reports on the impressive efforts of two German gentlemen that have used Java and other "modern" tools to create a website that emulates a MacSE.   Appropriately named  urlLink WebSE , this site "...allows anyone, on any platform, to run a facsimile of Macintosh System 7, the Mac operating system circa 1990  You can pretend to be Mr. Scott!  Did I mention that you can play Space Invaders on it? Who said there was never any good games on the mac?!!   Link shamelessly plundered from  urlLink insanely-great . Ta!

       Remember  urlLink Ship Of Fools  who we featured regarding their  urlLink 11th Commandment compo ? Well they launched an  urlLink online virtual church  last week. How did we miss that one? Unfortunately it has already been swamped with people logging in as Satan and swearing their heads off! The church is partly intended for people on the edges (and beyond them) of faith, so please be aware that the language and behaviour in church is often colourful and occasionally offensive. Please bear with us ? this is an experiment and we're working on creative solutions to the problem of mischievous visitors. Church of Fools is currently not suitable for children. Apparently moderators have been equipped with a 'smite' button! This  urlLink article at CNN  has more on the disruption. I thought CNN was supposed to be a serious news source? If so how can they say that someone who logs in with a legitimate username &amp; password is a 'hacker'? I've just logged into Blogger so I'm presumably a hacker now. I'm off to get a job as a security expert.

      I've just been on the  urlLink bStats site  which is Blogger's stats stuff for BlogSpot Plus users. Except it isn't. The page says that it is only for the premium service users yet I've just logged in, got my blog list and added the code to the New Links template. It works. Yay!  We are currently using  urlLink StatCounter  which is a really good free stats service with data drill downs by country, referrer etc. The only problem with it is that the free service only keeps the details for the last 100 hits. The bStats service looks like it keeps everything as there are pages to see most popular page of the day, week, month and year. There isn't as much info available in the stats but the fact it keeps the info for longer means it may ultimately end up the better stats to use for New Links.  The bStats front page has this bit on it: NOTE: bSTATS is currently free for Blog*Spot Plus users (hey, by the way, upgrade!) and not available for anyone else. If everything goes well, it will be available for others in the near future. So are they preparing to roll it out for free to Blogger users now or have they simply left the back door open? I don't know so I've left the StatCounter code in place for now just in case the 'free' bStats gets pulled for whatever reason.   EDIT:  I forgot to mention I found the bStats site via a post about bStats' temporary unavailability on the  urlLink Blogger Service Status  page.

      All the new features added by Blogger in their redesign have improved the design of the blogs no end with  urlLink lots of benefits  for those who have switched over. We implemented all the things mentioned in that article within hours of the redesign being launched and have been adding further hacks since. I've been meaning to write how-to posts for quite a while now and have finally got around to doing one. What with this and the long fabled Victoria Tunnel report allegedly coming on the same day you must be looking out of the window for the flying pigs now.  The first hack to be written up is the  On This Day  hack. That's because it is the simplest one to do, and by extension, the easiest for me to write up. So what does this hack do? Can you see the date at the top of the page? You'll notice it's a clickable link. The interesting bit is what it links to - the  On This Day  page at  urlLink Wikipedia  which has famous events, births, deaths and observed holidays from around the world all of which are linked to good articles on the subject. So for the effort of inserting a little bit of code in your template you automatically get a link of the day style thing for every day you publish a post. Note that you don't need to be using the new designs to use this hack - it works equally well on the old templates too.  Onto the hack itself.  The first stage is to ensure your dates are in the correct format. To do this go to the  urlLink dashboard  and then go to Settings / Formatting as shown here.   Set the date this format:   Set the date language to English. Mine is English UK but any of the English options should work.   Save your changes.  Now we are going to edit the template to put the JavaScript code in to do the date linking. Before you start you should back up your current template just in case there are any problems when you are implementing it. Done that? OK. Copy the following code and paste it just before the &lt;/HEAD&gt; tag in your template.  &lt;script type="text/javascript" language="javascript"&gt; function WikiOnThisDay(dateToMangle) {  var dateChunk_array1=dateToMangle.split(", ");  var dateChunk_array2=dateChunk_array1[1].split(" ");  if(dateChunk_array2[1].charAt(0)=="0")    dateChunk_array2[1]=dateChunk_array2[1].charAt(1);  return "&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" +         dateChunk_array2[0] + "_" +          dateChunk_array2[1] + "\"&gt;" +          dateToMangle +          " &lt;small&gt;[Click it!]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"; } &lt;/script&gt;  Now find this bit of code in your template...  &lt;BlogDateHeader&gt; &lt;h2 class="date-header"&gt;&lt;$BlogDateHeaderDate$&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/BlogDateHeader&gt;  ...and replace it with this code.  &lt;BlogDateHeader&gt; &lt;h2 class="date-header"&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; document.write(WikiOnThisDay("&lt;$BlogDateHeaderDate$&gt;")); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/BlogDateHeader&gt;  Save your changes. You can now either republish the blog to apply the changes to the whole blog or just wait until you post next to apply the changes to any new pages created.   Feel free to use this code on your blog. If you do use it, it would be nice to get a mention and a linkback to  urlLink this particular post  would be even better so that other readers can see how to do it.

        Has the world gone mad? Not yet as I hear that UEFA are refusing to hold a minutes silence as a mark of respect for the England fan who was murdered this week. With all due respect to the deceased I have to say that it's completely ridiculous to even contemplate holding a "ceremony" at the beginning of an international football match simply because somebody who enjoyed football was murdered whilst on a football holiday. At least UEFA have shown some sanity but no doubt they will be criticised for it. And the England team will all wear black armbands tonight. Like they're in mourning. Yeah right.

       Today  urlLink The Sun reports  (is that an oxymoron?) that Wayne is the new Pele. In their "exclusive" interview Pele states "Roo is the new me". I have a few problems with this... First of all it just bugs me that Pele, as a world recognised ambassador for football, is succumbing to 30 years of everyone telling him how great he is. Any modesty he had is gone in favour of attending a never ending stream of parties under the nomenclature of "the greatest footballer ever" and it seems his analysis of football skills is strictly limited to comparing footballers to his own greatness.  Secondly, Rooney is not as good as Pele and anyone who says otherwise, including Pele, is talking tosh.  But  urlLink Freddie Adu  might be the real thing.  Doh! If I can't resist the Pele comparison then what chance does Pele have?

Assuming it is what I think it is, that age old British sporting tradition of tying two people together and letting them kick seven shades out of each other's shins - but in the nuddie, then I think it would be a great way to solve the Group B qualification problem where England draw 0-0 with Croatia tonight and the Swiss beat France 4-0. Forget play-offs/penalty shoot outs/away goals/goals against etc and just tie Wayne Rooney to Thierry Henry and let them kick sh!t out of each other. My money's on Wayne.

So, until it works, we can ponder over the rumour that Bruce has turned down the  urlLink 2.75 million bid  in favour of staying with Birmingham.  Whilst we're on about fitba can someone explain how England are automatically through to the next stage providing we draw against Croatia tonight? What if France lose to Switzerland? Wouldn't that leave us with three teams on four points? Assuming that scenario is resolved by counting goals scored then how can we be certain that we will have scored more goals than France or Switzerland?

       It was announced a few weeks ago that 4 parts of the Beeb's internet arm were being closed. One of these was the Fantasy Football site which was a bit disappointing as I was looking forward to the start of a new season.  It turns out that it will be closing at the end of the coming season which means we have a free, decent, online, automatically scored,   urlLink Fantasy Football  game at our disposal. With prizes.  So should we set up a league for the New Links regulars? Leave comments below if you want in - if I get enough positive responses I'll make sure we have a league up and running for the start of the competition on August 28th.

      ..or when will that fat faced, weak chinned munter learn to stay away from his films?  Here's the all new Return Of The Jedi ending for the DVD release - with  urlLink Anakin inserted into the final screen  to tie up the loose ends created by plot inconsistencies caused by the release of the early Star Wars episodes.  I was under the impression the whole story was written before the filming of eps 4-6 were filmed - so if that's the case why weren't plot inconsistencies ironed out at that stage? Or is it just that George Lucas is an indecisve prick?

      As I'm on about Blair's nanny state I also have a problem with David Blunkett's announcement today that he's going to get tough on knife carrying. Sounds like something the government said  urlLink years ago  when a headmaster was stabbed and killed. Today's announcement is of course due to the schoolboy who was sentenced to life yesterday for the murder of another schoolboy. So just how is making carrying a knife illegal going to stop people stabbing other people? If you want to stab someone I don't suppose the illegal act of carrying a knife is going to put you off. It may have worked for guns but that's due to gun ownership being made illegal unless licensed. So are we going to need a licence to own knives?! Or is Mr Blunkett just repeating old promises that he has no intention of fullfilling? And will it make any difference anyway?

      I've always suspected that the government's national ID card plan was just one step closer to Blair's nanny state. Not that I'm against anything that will make it easier to track criminals but the Big Brother approach just seems like it's wide open for abuse. And now it seems that some of our MPs  urlLink think the same . 'Function creep' is the term used to describe fears that, despite good intentions, the national ID card will be used to do a lot more than just track criminals.

       Manhunt is on at least two front pages today and it is  urlLink guilty of murder . Apparently. As if it wasn't not bad enough that it got itself  urlLink banned from New Zealand  it's now gone and committed a murder in this country. Well according to the  urlLink Daily Mail  and  urlLink Daily Mirror  anyway.  Yes it that's old chestnut again - video games make you kill people. Daft fsckers.  Mind you its such an important issue to the Mirror that they almost made it the same size as their Fantasy Football ad. And the Daily Mail's other main story today? They have 2(!) pages dedicated to  urlLink animals on the Underground . So that makes New Links like the Daily Mail but 5 months faster and without the racialism. Yay!

        The Simpsons is going to have a character come out of the closet when Springfield legalises gay marriage and Homer becomes a minister.  So who is the  urlLink gay Simpsons character ? "Speculation is already running rife across fan websites about who will be the mystery gay character, ranging from Mr Burns' devoted sidekick Waylon Smithers to one or both of Homer's sisters-in-law." All I can say if it's Smithers it's not much of a bloody mystery - even my 10 year old daughter  knows  Smithers is gay.  My money's on Neddy boy but only because of his big gay moustache. But if it is going to be a mystery it's going to have to be harder than that. So I'm going to go for Mr Burns who will disappear into the sunset with Waylon.

      A nice story especially for those Newlinkers who need to fit in linkage amongst stuff they're supposed to be doing and getting paid for. Corinne Maier, a senior economist at Electricité de France, wrote a book about  urlLink The Art and the Importance of Doing the Least Possible at the Workplace  and now her employer is taking disciplinary action. Too bloomin' right I say. The nerve of some people. Of course NewLinkers are highly efficient work motivated multi-tasking individuals who can create linkage for our readers perusal whilst simultaneously debugging 10,000,000 lines of badly commented code. Probably.

       urlLink 11 reasons to sack Sven  from the Daily Mail. Reason number one being that Sven isn't the honest, cosmopolitan man of honour and integrity that we thought we'd hired. He's just a "money-grabbing, multi-national chancer". And for once I'm not bothered by the tabloids favourite sport - England manager assassination. He may be after the money (aren't they all?) but he's still a good football coach and he's shagged Ulrika. What's the problem? Errm? We didn't win Euro 2004. Errm? What's unusual about that? We wiz robbed. Again. Sack the manager.

      Buck up boyo, you're Anne Robinson!  When you're not offending the Welsh or stupid Americans on the dumbed-down transatlantic version of your hate-filled, lowest common denominator gameshow, you're being mean to people and pulling the legs off injured animals.

Oh yes, I can hurt you bad" way.  Maybe you're ultra-famous, but you'll always be a B-list celebrity in our eyes. At least you're not writing for the Daily Mail any more.

According to the blurb 14 bands have signed major deals since the site started although I can't find any details other than the claim.  There is a huge amount of material here and some of it has to be good if only by the law of averages. The music is broken up by genre so there is punk, rock, r'n'b (rhythm and bass rather than  proper  r'n'b but they do have a blues section), pop, dance etc etc.   via  urlLink linkfilter

      Technorati has come out of beta and has a new look to boot. Lots of other blogs are talking about the  urlLink Technorati  redesign. There are a lot of sites out there taking about how nice it looks - have they actually used it or just loaded the page? It seems to be badly broken.    urlLink Searches  haven't worked since yesterday and the link to profiles just stopped working. I needed to go and get some new code. Not a huge problem but it would be nice if they could have let users know that the links they have back to Technorati are useless. Oh and New Links was no longer registered as belonging to anyone - I had to reclaim it. And now I can't log in at all. At least when Blogger rolled out their redeisgn it came with loads of new features and took a while to settle down. Technorati seems to have introduced no new features just a new skin so what's their excuse?  Still not to worry - it looks nice.

      BugMeNot now  urlLink requires users to register . Don't worry though as this only applies to web weasels "If you are an employee, partner, affiliate or legal representative of any site which enforces compulsory user registration then we require you to complete our registration process. It costs nothing to register and will only take a moment." The form required is pretty big (although I have seen actual registration forms even bigger than that) and the questions are fairly silly. Revenge is sweet! ;)  BugMeNot are also asking non registration sites to add the following to their TOS: Any subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, or employees of any site employing compulsory user registration mechanisms are not authorized to access the content or services of this site. which would effectively make it illegal for say NY Times reporters to use the web if everybody did it. New Links may well have a one paragraph TOS in place tonight!  More on BugMeNot  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .

       NUFC.com asked readers to email in their views on  urlLink Newcastle United signing Patrick Kluivert . The link is to the first selection they've published.  For what it's worth I've wanted Kluivert to come to the toon for a few years now and it always seemed on the cards. But more recently it was Beattie who seemed to be our target and I had gradually warmed to and eventually liked that idea. I'm definitely not complaining though as Kluivert is world class - and we'll buy Beattie next summer when we are preparing for the Champion's League. ;)  I know Kluivert hasn't been as good recently as he has been in the past but I'm sure him and Shearer are going to be absolute magic together.

          Newcastle has been chosen to host a World Cup qualifier between England and Azerbaijan in March 2005.This good news has been tempered by the fact that the cockney scum over at Old Trafford will get to host the other 4 games!! When exactly did Manchester become the centre of England?  The reason given for the two grounds that have been chosen is the fact that they are the biggest in the country.It's all down to FA greed, the games could be shared with other cities such as Birmingham or Liverpool.The only problem is the FA will not get as much gate money.So what's a few quid compared to keeping a fresh atmosphere which you would get if the games were spread around and giving more people their last chance to see England in a quality game outside stinking London.It's only fair the games should be held outside London because when the new Wembley stadium is built the rest of England will never see another international game, but that's another argument.  urlLink BBC SPORT

      The UK Independence Party has decided to deal with women's issues. Godfrey Bloom, their new MEP for Yorkshire and Humber is concerned about women  urlLink "Because I just don't think they clean behind the fridge enough" . He also went on to say that no right minded businessman would ever employ a woman of child bearing age. I'm not sure what to make of UKIP, maybe they're having a laugh but I'm sure they're up to no good. I suspect they appeal to anyone who would like to bring back hanging, national service, corporal punishment, ban immigration and, if Mr Humber has his way, to put women back in the kitchen. No doubt they appeal to those who are too embarrassed to vote BNP.

        It seems  urlLink SBR agrees with Dogs  that God and Kluivert are very similar players as he has'nt started a game with them two up front in any of our pre-season friendlies.  Does this mean Dogs has a superior football knowledge or has SBR finally lost the plot? You decide. Remember the God/Sir les partnership, anyone?

        Seeing as Merg has taken such an interest in (and become our resident correspondent for covering) the political issues on the other side of the atlantic, here's a couple more interesting articles that I was reading this morning...   When he was governor of Texas, George W. Bush pushed for an abstinence-based sexual education curriculum. The lesson for Texas teens is that the only safe sex is no sex, and that may be a lesson that heads nationwide. Texas educators are debating what will be taught in new sexual education textbooks for its high school students. One textbook under review advises that a good way a teen-ager can prevent a sexually transmitted disease is to get plenty of rest so he or she can have a clear head about sex and choose abstinence. The 15-member Texas Board of Education is considering and will likely approve four books, all of which extol the virtues of abstinence. Three make no mention of contraceptives at all while one makes passing reference to condoms.    urlLink Texas Sex-Ed Textbooks Face Contraceptives Battle   Also this week, good ol'e George has also declared that his administration will "never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people."    urlLink New 'Bushism' Born at Bill Signing    Bunger's Quote of the Day&reg;: I can't remember who said it, but it runs like this : " making war to create peace is like fucking to preserve your virginity..."    via Yahoo!

      Apparently English is fast becoming the lingua franca of of the EU which means we will no longer have to shout at waiters abroad. Yay!  And who is responsible for this  urlLink rise to prominence for our language in Europe ? That'll be the Eastern Europeans who the  urlLink Daily Mail  wanted to keep out as they would be damaging UK culture or something. And scrounging benefits. And eating babies. Instead they are making it easier for us to go on holiday.  Their second language, if they have one, is nearly always English as they don't like Russian having spent years under Russian rule, don't like German (something to do with Hitler) and they don't like French (something to do with France). With the arrival of all these English speakers French and German are being marginalised.  The only thing to find out now is whether I can sue the school system for making me sit through all those shite French lessons - for nowt!

       Firefox is riding high in the linkback stakes according to a post at blakeross.com  Not even at 1.0 yet, Firefox already enjoys inbound links to its product page from a staggering 74,000 websites. This is 20,000 more than link to Opera, 5,000 more than link to Netscape, 15,000 more than link to Microsoft's IE page and 12,000 more than link to Apple. This is phenomenal!  All these figures are easily verifiable  by clicking on the links in the  urlLink article .  The article goes on to explain that a  urlLink database of posts  about Firefox has been created which is how I found out about it as we've had a few referrals from an  urlLink entry of ours . They are trying to get 2000 contactable sites by August 10th. As the sites are indexed people are asked to put on the contact details for the site. I've just put ours in which takes them to  urlLink 353  at the time of writing. This database is going to be used to contact people to get them to put the get Firefox button on their site. Well I think it's that button anyway as I couldn't find a link to buttons in the article.  Well there's ours in this post. I'll stick it in the sidebar at the weekend.    urlLink

       We've had  urlLink Google hacking  before but there's another mention of it in the news. It seems people running websites are still being careless with your info and leaving credit cards details lying about and it now it's being reported that  urlLink Google searches  can turn up these details.   via  urlLink Roowlants

         erm...   " width="64" height="64" />It seems the  urlLink Women of WalMart  didn't just get their tats out for any old reason - it seems they may have had to rely on food stamps to supplement a low income. I'm sure the money from Playboy came in handy.  California  urlLink paid out $86m in assistance to WalMart employees  in 2001 because their wages were so low and needed assistance in the form of food stamps and health related expenses. The study was based on data from that year but as WalMart wage increases haven't matched inflation levels the report reckons it will be even worse now.  So the next time you slap your arse in Asda's with a self satisfied grin spare a thought for their employees - they might be talking to Razzle right now.

      In the tradition of certain other dubious bloggy/news-type sites, people and readers ask their readership stupid questions. Great filler for those Slow-News-Days, too.  In order to perpetuate this pointless exercise, I've decided to inflict it upon our visitors too.  So, here's the very first "Aks Newlinks" -- in honour of a nameless aquaintance of ILN.  Since most (all?) of us are using Firebird, which Firebird extensions do you use? (And if you're feeling loquacious, why?)  I use:    Adblock -- zap any ad. A must.  Web Developer -- Some nice context-menu extras for web page work.  Tabbrowser Extensions -- Save and load tab sessions, undo close, general managment. Nifty.  Image Zoom -- For those times you just want to "make it bigger". The picture, the picture!  IE View -- For the broken sites.  EditCSS -- Edit CSS on the fly.  Bug Me Not -- For those with You-Must-Register site blues.    I was also running FlashBlock on older versions, but last I heard it didn't work on the latest Firefox. But right now, for me, nor does flash. I must get around to fixing that...

      I'm going to update the linkage in the sidebar soon to put some of the linkdump sites in that hve been referring to us. Some of them are pretty good.  Anyhoo - if anyone wants owt sticking in the sidebar shout out. Preferably a good source of linkage trawling but if it's a good blog or whatever they can go in too.

It will cost $249 and be available in late August    Anyone remember that show with  urlLink Doc Cox  (yes kids, he really is ZANY! With a capital ZEE!) and Esther Rantzen..? I think it was called "This Life" or something. I'm not sure, as it was a bit before my time. So, as a tribute to them, here's some pictures of fruit, that look like c0cks and f4nni3s, in a story cleverly titled  urlLink Thousands flock to see fruity display in Indonesia .    via  urlLink Yahoo!

      Hello Growabrain readers!  It seems Dogs' picture of a hairybacked man which he  urlLink claims to be me  has been picked up by  urlLink grow-a-brain . Twunt! The last time  urlLink grow-a-brain featured us  we got loads of hits so no doubt the same will happen today.  Luckily they didn't link direct to the post but to the front page - which means if I fill it up with Dogs stories today my thirst for revenge will have been satisfied. Probably.  So without further ado let me present the picture of Dogs after his capture at the Princess Di  waste of money  memorial  urlLink yesterday .    The picture is from a canny collection of 'Owned ' pics - check them out  urlLink here .   Owned pics via  urlLink dumpalink
