      At this point I am attempting to finish my stories for my book, they're going pretty well which is good, and I am returning to planet earth and attempting to contact the outside world again.  Which is always good.   Unfortuntately my back is KILLING me, but I have ways of combatting that. Happy Pills that the doctor is nice enough to perscribe you for pain. I'll be taking care of that before bed tonight. yea!  I've almost beat Champions of Norrath for the 3rd time. Titan and I beat it once together, and I beat it once with his sister. Now I'm beating it all by my lonesome, with my female dark elf knight. Lots of hacking and slashing and flying body parts.  Other than that, bowling with the league today was abysmal...My scores were SO low. I still broke over 110 with all of them, but i dunno. My hand hurts. Hmmm, if it wasn't for the fact that I know that sometimes I need the heavier ball (an 11lb) I'd only bowl with the 9 and 10lb balls. Ah well, one day my hand WON'T hurt after bowling. Either way, that's about it. I must dip out. There's nothing else going on in my life, just writing, trying to find a job, and seeing where life takes me. I'm out. Audi 5000.

      I'm attempting to return from the random places my mind has been lately. I mentioned in my last post that I'm writing a book, and so I've been zoning more than usual. Basically, I think I would like to try and get this longer story that I've been working on for years finished. Well, technically, it IS finished, I'm in my 3rd or 4th revision. I think that that one would make a really good book, and the characters could be expanded and get their own stories. As for future stories, I don't know if that would be wise...just based on how it ends, but back stories would give me fodder for YEARS. My guess is that once I get a little bit farther in what I'm doing, I'll be back on planet earth, using my cell phone and calling people that I've been MIA from for a sec. (sorry J.)   Beyond that, I worked a 8 hour shift at another store last night, which was cool. I needed the hours and everyone I worked with was very nice. By the end of the evening, I was using accents and being an all around fool as usual. Then I went bowling for a few games. The magager that I was working with writes movies, so that gives me more to audition for (along with Wacko Productions if I haven't been struck as a possible actor for them) Which makes me VERY happy, cause I'm happiest when I'm performing.   I mentioned that I had scored pretty high in the bowling league that I'm in, well, I had a chance to look at the standings and I did more than alright. I got the women's top score as I said, and I am second for women's overall pinfall and second in women's average. I'm down from the top score by no more than 20 pins. I felt awesome. All the guys were teasing my partner because I came in a few weeks late and am wrecking on the scoreboards. I think I'm doing pretty darn good. I'll probably go bowling in a few anyway. It's quartermania sundays so with my coupons, every game is a quarter. plus being in a league gets me discounts on shoes and all that jazz. So I'll probably go and get some practice in, cause I will be expected to hold up my title as the women's high score, well, I'm too damn competative not to. So Beyond that, I must bid thee adieu. I'm out. Audi 5000

      I was just informed by a publisher (a VERY close friend of the family) that I have 2 months to get a book together. Something fairly short (only about 80 pages or so), which isn't bad. I'm SOOO excited. I've been writing since I was about ...oh....10 or so. (although thankfully my stories have REALLY progressed since then) Since she told me a few hours ago, I've been trying to figure out how to do it. The way I see it I have a couple of choices. Either I do a series of short stories and/or poems, or I do one long story. I belive the short story book would go over better simply because it allows me to showcase many different stories and then whatever goes over the best can be elaborated on or given it's own series. Provided things go over well. But the input that I have gotten back on things I've written has all been positive. So....I just have to figure out what's good enough to make the cut and what I need to create. I have 2 stories right off the bat that would work, 3 if I can find this other one that I KNOW is good enough to make it. Plus there are 2 or 3 that I'm revamping that could work. I'm super excited about this! I'm gonna have a book!!!  Other than that, Family is good, life ain't half bad. God is ALWAYS good, and if I could just get rid of this zit that decided to make an appearance in the middle of my freaking nose, I'd be perfect. Anyway, I must bid the adieu.

      Now, a year ago, I would have said that girlfriends are evil, and they may work for some, but I require guyfriends. (which wasn't exactly true because I DO have some girlfriends, FEW, but I do) I live with 2 other females (both a year older than me) in a house (3br, 2 1/2 bath (I have my own), 3lr, kitchen, dining room,front and back yard, and a basketball goal) It works out pretty well cause we all have different schedules.  In the beginining, we all spent a lot of time at home, and we used to talk fairly frequently. For the last couple of months, I've only really seen them in passing. Which kinda sucks, cause I missed hanging with them. I finally got used to having a couple of live-in girlfriends that I could talk to about anything, and then we really didn't have time for each other. Now things have settled down (both of them have found men, one has her soulmate, the other has someone who will probably end up being her soulmate) And our schedules are changing a little. This evening, we all actually had a little time to sit and talk like we used to. It was a lot of fun. We give each other advice, support one another, and tell each other when we're being stupid.  I really like that. I also was able to talk to one of my guyfriends this afternoon. That was cool too. He and I are a lot alike, and he's SOOO in love with his girl (in a few years they'll be getting married. awwww) Things are just going pretty good. Now, if I could only find a job so I'm no longer broke....Ah well, God has never let me down, and He won't start now. I need to go and take care of some more things(including sending out my resume to a bunch more places) pray for me! Audi 5000

      I didn't post yesterday because blogger.com was having issues.  I'm 100% competitor, and 100% perfectionist. What's "good enough" for someone else is likely not good enough for me. Now, in some cases, that's good. Work, my writing....yeah. Now in sports or games or relationships, that can be VERY BAD!!!  In the past I've dated guys, learned there was competition, and gone on to win the guy just because I wanted him, not because I really wanted him or that I thought things would be perfect or any other nonsense like that. Competition pure and simple. I like to win. Now, had I not been so freaking competitive, I would have realized that those guys were not the right ones for me, and never would have persued things. But NOOOO....I had to win by any means necessary. Playing fair of course, but when I really want something (or someone) I get it (or them). No matter what. Now, that's not exactly good, and would explain why so many of those relationships didn't work. The worst part is, I LIKE competition. I REALLY like it. I like beating others. I like to win. In a relationship. I like to compete with my special someone. It needs to be fairly even or in my favor otherwise I don't take it as well (unless it's something I know I'm going to lose)  Is there a purpose to my competative nature? Not sure, could be a throwback from the ID that only cares about food and sex. Primal nature to compete for the best. The best mate, the best food, the best items. Whatever. I do know that it has helped me. Where others would give up or just not care, I have a habit of making sure that I'm #1. In the job aspect, I make myself irreplacable, and it works. (Til there's a massive layoff) Either way, that's the way life goes.   Either way, I have to take care of a few more things. Titan and I started the bowling league today we're working as a team vs competing against each other. I got my all time high score of 233 today. I got 6 strikes in a row. I felt AWESOME about that. We kicked butt. That was fun. I can't wait til next week. I did knock out the former female high score and I have the second highest average. Competition and Perfectionism at their best. Audi 5000.  Remember, all the world's a stage, and Thespians ALWAYS do it on stage!

      Video games are taking over. Since my phone was acting up, I continued playing Champions of Norrath. It's so freaking addictive. I think we've got ...probably around 2 more acts to go. I'm a level 17 1/2 Wood Elf. I'm such a nerd....  Beyond that, I've had a few surprise shifts.. like the one I'm about to be late for...I can't wait til I find a new job.  I'm missing my friends! Which is mostly my fault, and partly works fault. But we shall see. Maybe when I get off I can hit up bowling with the UPS crew....we shall see, it all depends on if we actually ARE. Anyway I must go, so PEACE!

      I would gloat some more about how the Pistons killed the Lakers (which I DID predict, and it's here in writing) But I'm still attempting to figure out what to request from my bets. Hmmmm, I see...I see....I don't know yet. Once I figure it out, I'll let you know.  I just woke up not that long ago. I decided to take a nap this afternoon, cause I was supposed to hang with friends this evening. However, I thought I had set my alarm, and I had thought that my phone was plugged in to charge up. Right? Wrong. I just woke up about 10-15 minutes ago, and my phone is dead. It wasn't plugged into the wall, and so it didn't charge and it died. I'm currently waiting for it to come back on. So I apologize! I'll call laters J. Or actually, I'll probably call tomorrow. Beyond that...I figured I should link to my friends blogs, the one who got me started, and the other who I got started.  J.'s Blog & Production Website www.wackoprodutions.com  Resident X's Blog  www.mentalmachinations.blogspot.com  And for the record, yes I am the rabid Pistons fan that he mentions in today's post.  Beyond that...I'm still tired, and I think I'm hungry. grrr. Anyway, I must go, I've got to take care of a few things for the mommy person. Audi 5000

      *clears throat* THE PISTONS ARE THE 2004 NBA CHAMPIONS, THEY KILLED THE LAKERS IN A 3 GAME WINNING STREAK AND WON THE TITLE AT HOME FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER (ALTHOUGH THEY WON BACK TO BACK TITLES IN 89 AND 90) GO PISTONS!!! and the Lakers are breaking up.  Ok, now that I have that out of my system. Sloan, you LOST!!! Just like I said you would. Banks, you lost worse than Sloan did because you did a game by game bet, AND the overall bet. It's good to be me!  Beyond gloating up a storm (and I shall continue to gloat, no Laker fan can say ANYTHING to me ever again. Sports life is good.) I've got work in about 20 minutes. I just wanted to go ahead and update, cause when I get off work, I've got to continue beating Champions of Norrath. (I am SUCH a gamer) Things are getting good with the game. I'm having too much fun with it. Beyond that, I'll probably hang with friends tomorrow night, and beyond that...well, let's just say that I haven't gotten much farther than that at this point.  Update on Fyre and Ten, they're so much into each other it's sickening. I should copy some of her emails to me in here. He's this, he's that, he's so sweet. *gagging noises* I'm going to be sick. But I'm very happy for her. Sounds like she found the  "One"...I'm still fairly convinced mine was hit by a bus. Either way, that still remains to be seen. When God hits me upside my head and tells me "That's your soulmate, shut up and go be happy" I'll listen. Til then? I'm living single. Anyway, I'm out. Audi 5000

      Tonight The Pistons win the Championship for the first time since 88. (I belive it's 88, I could be wrong. ) They lead the series 3-1, and NO team has ever come back after losing 3 games to 1 to win it. Even all the laker fans I know (and I know a LOT of them) have thrown in the towel. I've won. All my bets, all of it. I've won. The Pistons are AWESOME!  Moving on, my bad for not posting for the last few days. I've been celebrating my birthday again, dealing with visiting family members, and all around attempting to stay out of major trouble. (and unfortunately succeeding.)  Isn't it funny when people prove that they are just not who they think they are? I find that HELLA amusing. Some people just have NO sense. Simple as that. Maybe one day I'll explain the whole story, but right now? NAH!  Hmmmm....is there anything else in my life??? Nah, still job searching, still dealing in general. A little down here and there, but hey, that's life. Anyway, dinner is calling so I must dip. Audi 5000.

      Why is it that Magic 8 Balls can sometimes be entirely too true? You can sometimes ask a question (For me, more often than not) and it gives a true answer...very strange...  As far as everything else, I'm enjoying winning bets and I'm getting ready to go have fun with friends.   Soulmates....because of Fyre that particular topic is on my mind. I'm begining to wonder if they really do exist. IF they do, is there only one soulmate for everyone, or are there multiple options, and what happens if you get with one, and meet another? It seems fairly unfair if there's only one soulmate for someone out of the 6 billion people on the planet. Responses?   Ok, I'm late. Gotta run. Audi 5000

      PISTONS WON, PISTONS WON 2-1! WE LEAD THE SERIES!!! GO DETROIT!!!  Ok, now that I have that out of my system, I can get on with the post. I've just gotten off work to the wonderful news that my Pistons have been kicking all kinds of Laker butt this evening. :) it makes me smile cause my night has been freaking hell. Let me just say, I was working in TV, I AM an actor, but I got laid off :*( so I'm doing some customer service stuff at the moment to pay the bills. I can sell ice to an eskimo, but I don't particularlly care for it. I've been cursed out, had the computers crash, and deal with loud, obnoxious, rude, condesending customers all freaking night. My back hurts, I have a migrane, all I want to do is relax. And I will, right after I call some people and gloat over the outcome of the game. I've got a couple of bets going. Not for $$, I never bet $$. But I have 2 over-all bets that the EAST will take it (GO PISTONS), and a game by game set of bets. Thus far, I am of course in the lead, and it better stay so, or I'll be forced into doing something random. As an actor who's played a myriad of parts (almost always the slut or the bitch, I guess it has to do with my gorgeous curvy figure...I don't have the body of the "good girl") I don't really get embarassed. One of the people I've bet will try to embarass me, the other will probably try to do the same, but we have this BIG competition thing going, so it's a toss up. ah, we shall see.  Beyond having the night from hell, I'm doing ok. I look forward to doing nothing but gloating for the rest of the evening. hee hee hee. Anyway, that's basically it for what's going on. Oh yeah...  Update on Fyre and Ten...Fyre has REALLY begun to think of Ten as her man. I'm floored. She's only known the guy for 5 days! But she's already calling him hers and everything. He's already told her that she's his, he's hers, and he's just waiting for her to accept it and be happy. WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH EVERYONE FINDING THEIR FREAKING SOULMATES??? I know about 4 other people (male and female) who have recently found the person they believe they are meant to be with. It's almost enough to make you sick. Well, I guess deliriously happy, sappy, and in love is better than bitter and depressed. Either way. I must bid everyone adieu. Audi 5000

      First off, I am not mad at my Pistons for losing last night, it was a fluke, and the Lakers barely won it. They now go to Detroit where the Pistons will kill them in a 3 game winning streak and win the championship, upsetting Laker fans everywhere.  Beyond that, I'm responsible for a friend begining his own blog, which I think is funny cause a good friend of mine got me started blogging. So I guess it's like a virus...ewwww someone new has been infected by the Blog. ha ha. Ok incredibly lame joke. I knew that. As for me..I'm still job searching and attempting to not go insane. It's not necessarily working, but hey, stranger things have happened. I hit a snag with my story and am attempting to get through that. This weekend should prove interesting...it'll be fun. I'm supposed to go and see the Lord of the Rings movies...well, the first 2 anyway on Sunday. That should be fun. Although I'm not sure yet how I plan to sit through 8 hours of movie. I had too much trouble sitting through each of them the first time. Don't get me wrong, I was very interested, the problem was I'm antsy. And I read the books back in 2nd-3rd grade, so I knew the story already. Made things a trifle dissapointing, but I still enjoyed them. Today has been one of those lazy days. I'm kinda just here. I'd like to go do something, maybe I'll just be out tonight.  I dunno. Ummm, what else? There was something. Oh yeah.   Soulmates. Do they really exist, or is it just a figment of our imaginations because we'd all like to belive that there is someone out there that can love us for who we are, who will compliment us as people, who will add something to our lives, and who we can give our heart to in return that will make us feel complete. I'm fairly sure mine was hit by a bus. Is it normal for a male to tell a female that she's his soulmate when they've only known each other a short while? I have a friend we'll call Fyre, and we'll call dude...Ten.  Fyre is a very good friend of mine, one of the few close female friends I have, she lives in another state and has been my VERY good friend since we were children. Now, she met Ten while she was out with some of her sorority sisters, he approached her, gave her his number, and asked her to call him. According to her, dude is hot. Since she and I have VERY different taste in men. I just kind of was like. ok. Her sorors convinced her to call, and they conversed all night. The next day, they had a date, and she was over joyed. They saw each other everyday for following 3 days (and they have plans to see each other tomorrow I think.) He has told her he is convinced that she is his soulmate. And he hers. She went on and on about how comfortable they were together, how she feels like she's known him forever, how wonderful he makes her feel (all of this without them even having kissed) Then she told me a few things he's said to her. Now, guys will say a LOT of things when they're trying to get into your pants, but stuff she "says" he said was stuff she told me YEARS ago about what she wanted in her future husband (we were 16 and she was planning out her wedding. stupid teenage girl stuff) So, I told her to chill out and wait and see where things would go. She is...but I can tell the girl is freaking sprung. Not in love yet (thank God, I cannot deal with the love at first sight stuff, that doesn't exist, LUST or ATTRACTION at first sight does, but love does NOT. it takes time to rot you from the inside) So I'll keep you posted on how that goes. I still don't know if I truly belive I have one (if I do he was probably hit by a bus) so I'll see if God sends me someone. We shall see. At the moment I'm HAPPILY single, and plan to stay that way. The next relationship I get in, I want it to be with someone that I'll probably marry. Since I don't know when that'll happen, I'll probably be single for a while. No big. Anyway, I must go, I've made you read enough for one day. Audi 5000

      Ok, on my birthday, the Pistons gave me the best present of all, the WIN at the LAKERS' home when everyone expected the Pistons to get killed right off. So to any Lakers fans: PISTONS RULE, PISTONS RULE, THEY WON, THEY BAD!!! LAKERS SUCK!  Ok, now that I have that out of my system (until tonight anyway when they play again) I can continue on. My birthday was oodles of fun. I spend most of the evening...ok almost all of the evening, under the influence (but I did NO driving. that's bad) but it was fun. Kind of got an impromptu sort of surprise from people I didn't expect to see, and that was nice. The next day (yesterday) was spent recovering (not from a hangover, cause I don't get hungover, REALLY good genes) attempting to recover sleep (cause passing out really isn't restful.) and working. All in all it was an AWESOME day, and I enjoyed it very much. Beyond that..umm, I had to work this morning, but was tired so I really couldn't concentrate. At this point I'm just chilling. I have all these things in my head that I'm attempting to get down on paper (a specific story that I'm working on) but it's not really flowing that way. I have it all in my head (or at least the first part, the last part still remains to be seen)and it's driving me nutz that I can't seem to write or type fast enough to get it out. *screams* oh well. I'm sure I will eventually.  GO PISTONS, GO PISTONS! ok,had to get in one last good luck wish for the game tonight.

      Happy Birthday to me! Yeah!!! It's my favorite day of the year (and I'm young enough for that to still be the case. I am now 24 years old)   The day started out very good...well I missed church cause I was recovering from being under the influence (not hung over, I NEVER get hung over) but I was not in the condition to be going to church, besides I would have fallen asleep. That would NOT have been good. Mommy took me out to breakfast (yum), then we went shopping (YES!!!), and now I'm blogging, and checking email, and later....I don't know what happens later, I know that alcohol in large quantaties does, but beyond that...it's a toss up. Not to mention the PISTONS killing the LAKERS. Works for me. So that's what'll happen next....well, at the moment, I need food, cause I'm hungry. So I think I need to do something about that.    Now something a little more esoteric. Is the mind seperate from the soul? We will assume that the mind is different from the brain (mind being who we are/personality; brain being the muscle that holds our memory and reminds us to breathe) But is the mind seperate from the soul? If one holds to the belief that the soul is who we really are and the part of us that lives forever (or gets sent on to the next life depending on one's views) Wouldn't that mean that the mind is a part of the soul, being personality and who we are same as the soul?Would they be considered a part of each other, or just work in concert. Could one seperate one from the other?if so, would that change who a person is. What makes us who we are? Is it something preordained, or is it simply the circumstances around us that make us who we are?  Sorry, It popped into my head, so I ran with it. I will probably add a little more to that tomorrow. Anyway, gotta go, I hear vodka calling!  Happy Birthday to me!

      Auspicious begining for my third post, no? Well, something wicked this way comes, the most sinister day of the year...my birthday. Yesterday I was a little down (and fairly annoyed as well) I always seem to get pre-birthday blues a day or 2 before the big day. Now don't get me wrong, I'll only be 24, so it's not like I'm feeling my age or anything like that, but I dunno, it just kinda, sorta happens. As for this evening, I'm not sure what exactly is going to happen, I know that I'm going to have fun! Hanging with friends, and spending as much time inebriated as possible. I look forward to it. I think I shall head to this arcade....but I don't know. I kinda would like to spend time with a friend of mine, but....a.) I don't want to get him sick of me and b.)I don't want the "condition" that I'll be in to affect things with him. Cause he's a good guy, and I really like spending time with him, but I don't want him to get hurt. I always seem to hurt the nice ones. Not purposely... of course not. He should probably run screaming in the opposite direction now. Reguardless of that fact, I don't think he will. But if he doesn't, I dunno. I guess we'll see. At the moment, good friends is all I need to be with anyone, life's safer that way. :) That way, no one gets hurt, and everybody's happy. There are times when I wonder if it wouldn't be safer for everyone to just have a stable full of cuddle bitches and let it go at that. (cuddle bitches- guys whose sole purpose is for cuddling and fuzziness-feelings without intimacy, emotions, or sex. So basically like a teddy bear that hugs back that you can put back on the shelf when finished.) At the same time, keeping up with them can sometimes be annoying as well. So, I guess I'll just have to let things progress and see where this life thing leads. Having said that, it's about time I end this post and dip. Byeeee!

      I'm back, a little later than usual, but I'm back. I got called into work this afternoons when I was SUPPOSED to be off cause my birthday's Sunday. (go me!) So that was a bummer, but not too bad, cause I'm off now. Let's see, last night was very nice because a very good friend of mine was nice enough to make me a special birthday dinner (crab legs, one of my ALL time favorite foods). I was surprised for a number of reasons, 1. that he paid that much attention to things that I said to remember that I mentioned how much I like them, and 2. that he cared enough to spend the $$, cause that ain't exactly cheap. And  he bought me this AWESOME vodka (my poison of choice) that doesn't taste like alcohol. How awesome is that, you get the feeling without the taste...or maybe that's dangerous....hmmm, I'll have to think about that. Considering it's my birthday weekend, I plan on spending as little time as possible sober, but it's my birthday so I can. ha ha. Other than that, I'm experiencing a little pre-birthday depression. It happens almost every year, I'm not sure why, it just does. So at the moment I'm not the best company, which I guess is good cause I'm alone right now. No big tho. Ummm, what else is going on in my life...ummm, I think that's about it really...anything else...I dunno, if anything else comes to mind, I'll come back and post it. I'm currently working on about 6-7 different stories, (which is normal) so I may toss something out here to see how it sounds. Anyway, I must bid you adieu for the evening. Hasta manana!

      Just when I thought I couldn't make my life any more stranger or complicated, I decide to create a Blog. Cool. This not sure what to think of it at the moment, but this gives the journal in my room some competition. I guess I should say a little something about myself...hmmm I'm 24, or I will be 24 on Sunday (it's my birthday!!!) YEAH for me! I'm female (VERY FEMALE, once I put up a pic, you'll understand why) ummm, I'm an actor, writer, sports enthusiast (GO PISTONS, KILL THE LAKERS!!!) I enjoy working out, sports, rollerblading, reading, bowling, painting, playing on the internet, hanging with friends...hmmm, well...there's more of course, but I'd hate to drive my readers (provided I end up HAVING readers) insane on the first post, I've got PLENTY of time to do that. ha ha ha. Anyway, I'm currently searching for a job (was working in tv and got laid off) but it's hard cause the job market sucks. I'm single, having had a mutual ending of an almost 2 year relationship, I'm renting a house with 2 female roomies...which is cool...and I'm just getting through each day thus far. If I miss a day here or there, don't trip....cause this weekend especially, circumstances being what they are, I may not be able to post every single day, but I CAN promise that it won't be more than a day or so between posts. Cool? Cool. Tyght. Well, once again, Welcome to my world, I hope you enjoy your stay and I'll see you again soon.

       This post is to just let everyone know that I'm not dead. Busy? yes! Tired? Yes! Stressed? YES!!! So you'll have to excuse me&nbsp; if I'm not blogging every day.&nbsp; Shouts out to those that love me...They know who they are (Stace!!!!) I promised I'd do&nbsp; that. I apologize that I've been MIA lately, but I've had writers block, work, and&nbsp;assorted other stresses ($$$) So...that's why I've been gone. I'll be back soon though.,   &nbsp;Peace and sanity,    Caaramel Ice

        &nbsp;Ok, normally I don't really get a chance to see most movies until AFTER they come out on video...but for some STRANGE reason, I've actually seen a few of them before that. And before they've been in the theaters forever and a day. Thanks to my family (lovely "family time" before we cart my baby bro away to college) I've seen White Chicks and Spiderman 2.    I guess I'll start with Spiderman 2. Yes it was good, DEFINITELY worth paying to see. I found it predictable, but, most action movies follow a formula...so it was GOING to be predictable, and left open for Spiderman 3, with undoubtably will be in the works in the next year or so if it isn't already. At times (to me) it was slow, and I'm sorry and I'm sure I'll get flamed for this, but I HATE Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane. She should NEVER be a red-head, and she doesn't strike me as beliveable. Durring scenes where she was promient, I found myself cringing. Now, don't get me wrong, I think she's a very good actress, I LOVED her in Interview with a Vampire and Virgin Suicides, but I HATE her in this movie. I guess being an actor, a writer, and knowing so much about how these films are made ruins it a little for me, cause I don't always enjoy the movie-going experience. I've lost a lot of my desire to see them. Not because I think I'm SOO much better (sometimes I do, but it's more of I would have played a character differently, or written it differently), but going to the movies no longer holds the same magic for me. Some movies I'm able to look past all of that (mainly because they are truely spectacular ex: Lord of the Rings trilogy, Shrek 1&amp;2, etc) but many times, I find myself so antsy that I can't sit through it. Some movies make me want to RUN FAR AWAY from the theater and not look back (ex: Catwoman, Anaconda 2:search for the blood orchid, chick flicks, etc.) All in all, Movies may have come a LONG way visually, but a lot of what Hollywood produces is still crap.&nbsp; Moving on White Chicks was surprisingly funny. Actually worth the ticket price. That I didn't expect. When my mom called me up and asked if I would join her in watching this movie, I was only going cause it was free (for me) But although she found it hysterically funny, I found it to actually have been pretty well written. Predictable, of course, but as I said, most movies follow a set of formulas, and knowing those formulas allow you to even predict dialouge (which annoys people I've seen movies with to no end. I can't help it!) Reguardless, it was refreshingly amusing, as it&nbsp;poked fun at stereotypes. I do enjoy the Wayans bros, and having met them YEARS ago (when their show first began, long before the Scary Movie franchise) I know that they are very sweet, very nice, and just as sexy (if not sexier) in person as they are on screen.*sigh* enough of that. Anyway, to make a&nbsp; LONG post short, they're both good movies. I'd go on about Shrek 2...but thats been out for a second, I LOVED it and plan to buy it, and it's one of the best movies of all time. ok. I gotta go now. Audi 5000.

       Ok, for the record, I don't go out very often, I tend to stay busy (lately more so than ever), but one of my roomies expressed that she was in the mood to be out of the house, and to just have a little fun (and to have the admiration of the male species because it just makes a girl feel good).   I told her that I was game, I haven't been out like that in a LONG time...so why not right? Her cousin came along as well so that brought the group up to 3. Now I'm on a SERIOUS budget right now, as are they, so Thursday night seemed like a good night, clubs are free, and being attractive females, there's a VERY GOOD chance that someone of the male species would offer to purchase us a beverage over the course of the evening. So, we could go have some fun, basically for free. Now, we went to a&nbsp;lounge in the downtown Atlanta area, because we were not really in the mood to club, just wanted to listen to some music, maybe dance a little, and just be out. So we arrive and luckily find a parking space on the street, less than 50 feet away from the door to the club. (which was exceptionally awesome, cause we both wore very sexy heels that would eventually make our feet hurt) We waited for her cousin to join us, and the 3 of us headed down the sidewalk to the lounge.&nbsp; This particular lounge has an outside front patio with bar, inside dance floor with dj and bar, and a downstairs level, with a nice sized room for people to sit, a bar, and another dance floor. As we walked in front of the patio, there were men leaning over the railing across the entire thing. It felt good to turn heads as we walked by, plus no obnoxious catcalls. We showed our ids, went in, and walked around the place (mainly cause I'd never been there) Once we'd done that, we went downstairs because it was a little less crowded.&nbsp; That's where all the weirdos in Atlanta seemed to be. My roomie and I were standing on the wall, and one guy to the left turns to us and says, "I've got hiccups." My rommie and I are like "What?"   he was like "I've got hiccups, I like women." And then proceeds to tell my roommate something else as random, I on the other hand am being bothered by this guy who SWORE he was THE MAN. And kept trying to grab my hands. Those that know me know that I was on the verge of dropkicking him over the bar.&nbsp; We grabbed her cousin and moved away from there, down to the dance floor where we could talk and dance and laugh at the older gentleman on the dance floor trying to "drop it like it's hot" problem was, it was NOT.&nbsp; Over the course of the evening, all of us danced with about 1 normal guy, and a couple of weirdos, including our own personal stalker THE MAN, who annoyed all 3 of us as often as he possibly could. The music was nice, and aside from the weirdos that managed to come out, it was a fun night. We left fairly early, because everyone had work today, and we wanted to get some sleep. Besides, after 3 hours of being bothered by idiots, our bullshit quota for the day had been reached. We actually ended up leaving right before the place (which isn't super large to begin with) became so crowded that the fire marshal would need to step in. Perfect. Anyway, I get to spend the next few hours working on my book, then I have to go by my job. fun for me. I must go, so I bid thee adieu. Audi 5000

      I figured since I've been MIA for so long, I might as well name the planet that I happen to be on. I figured MKB would work. The book is going very well, and I'm excited about seeing what happens next. Don't I already know? Well...sort of. I have the basic write up, the skeleton if you will, but as far as knowing EXACTLY how everything will flesh out...nope. Can't say that I do. It's better this way, cause then the story writes itself, instead of me forcing it. It tends to flow better this way. I have to help my mother take down her braids this evening....I don't mind...I just am pouting a little cause the plan was for me to write my little heart out (I hit a zone last night and everything just flowed, I wanted to get that zone back!) But I guess it'll have to wait til I can head home later tonight. I guess it's a good think I don't know how to go to sleep early. Plus, she's feeding me, and the budget I'm currently on doesn't allow for fast food, and I don't feel like cooking. I miss my friends. And I feel horrible cause I haven't talked to anyone in a while. I keep meaning to call after 9 when it's free...and I either hit a zone, am at work (cause I'm in mamagement training) or I'm not concious. I think that one of my friends is REALLY mad at me, but can't tell me right now cause he's in a zone. Sorry J. I'm going to do better. Since I have tomorrow off, I can try to spend most of the day writing so that my evening will be free to converse with people. Hmmm, that sounds like a plan. Ummm....I guess that's about it...at this point I'm just tired. I guess I'm a little down, but haven't figured out why yet. I need to look into that. Anyway, I have to commence with the unbraiding, so I'm out. Audi 5000.

      "Raindrops keep falling on my head..."  Sorry, that songs in my head for some random reason. Don't ask why, it just is. I normally have random songs playing in my head. Those of you who know me already know this, those that don't..well now you know.   I'm a little annoyed with a co-worker of mine, because he happens to be a writer (but mostly does songs and poems) and I was telling him about my book. There are FEW people that I've let see the story or even told them what it's supposed to be about. Anyway, I began telling him about it, and he asked a question about it. That little question sparked my imagination, and I just finished writing a 4 page front and back, size 2 font of backstory for the New version of my book that I'm now writing. I'm glad that it didn't require a whole new story, so that of the 66 pages that I've written thus far, I don't have to scrap them, I just need to revise them  for the UMPTEENTH TIME!!! So once I get this down, I may put up a page or so on the blog for input.   J- I'll have to get you a copy of the new version once I finish writing it, til then I still want your input on the first one.  Ummm, other than that...still looking for a job, still working on the book, and trying to get back to contacting my friends, I miss them. At this moment though, I'm feeling  sick, so I'm going to go now. Audi 5000.

      Don't know about the rest of the world, but I think my life would be more fun if the soundtracks (and sometimes commentary) that runs through my head could be heard by everyone I come into contact with. Then again...that might get me into all kinds of trouble.   For example, one day a WHILE ago, Outkast's last album had just come out, and I was sitting listening to it when my mother came into the room and began dogging me out about something or other, I don't remember, but the song "Roses" was on. Cool right? As she finished, and of course I was sitting there respectfully, the end of the song came on and NOT the edited version they play on the radio and video. To those that may not be familiar with the song, at the end the phrase "Crazy Witch" is repeated. On the cd, it's "Crazy Bitch" Now, just as she finished, that part of the song was playing, and it took everything I had not to laugh because that's exactly what I was thinking. I was wrong, yes I know, but it was funny, she eventually heard it and "requested" that I turn it off immediately, but all I could think was "How appropriate" But if that was going on in the background EVERY time, I'd likely not be here, cause someone would have killed me by now. Then again, the fact that I'm still here in spite of things like that says a lot...  Beyond that The book that I explained about in my last post seems to have made an impression on a few people. The thing about the love languages isn't just for your significant other, those love languages REALLY help you see how people in general operate. Siblings, parents, friends, family, co-workers, even strangers, the was that people enteract with one another is a lot of times blatantly shown in one of the 5 love languages.  The only possible exception being actors...they tend...well, they tend to gravitate more towards quality time (attention) and physical touch. But they have the ablility to show you all 5...actually all the actors I know are like that. But hey...I wonder if there's a common link in our pasts or something...hmmmm, that's something worth looking into...  I've got a part in a movie this weekend! I'm SOO excited. It's an independent film that's being done by some friends of mine. I'll keep you posted on how that goes. Well, I must go, I've got to go and work on my book. I'm out. Audi 5000!

      According to this wonderful book I'm reading, there are 5 love languages:  1. Words of Affirmation- This type of person feels loved when the other tells them how they feel. Cards, love notes, verbal support, etc. They need to hear how the other person feels.  2. Quality Time- This type of person needs to spend time with the other person. They need to be with them wether they are doing something, or just need to sit and talk.  3. Acts of Service- This type of person feels loved when the other does things for them, cooking, cleaning, laundry, yard work, running errands, etc.  4. Gift Giving- This type of person needs gifts, not always the big expensive kind, but the thoughtful kind to show love and to feel loved. Could be as simple as picking up a favorite candy bar because you were out and you saw it and you know they like it.  5. Physical Touch- This type of person HAS to be in physical contact as much as possible. They show love and feel loved when the other person is touching. Not always the sexual, but just holding hands, massage, sitting close enough to each other for some kind of physical contact.   Everyone has a primary and a secondary. My primary is a double of Words of Affirmation and Physical Touch.  My secondary is Quality Time. I'm a very huggy, touchy-feely type of person, and I'm the type of person that NEEDS to hear how you feel. I need to hear that you love me, that you support me, that I make you happy. If I don't hear it, and you don't show me lots of affection, give me lots of attention,and spend lots of time with me I don't feel loved. Whoever I date will HAVE to understand this. If they can't or won't, they aren't the one for me and that's that.   I really like this book cause it helps you stay happier longer, because you understand what your partner needs to feel loved, and the more you do for them, the more they do for you, and everybody wins. I found all this VERY interesting, because it explains a lot about people. After reading, you begin to look at people you know, and that you've dated or are dating currently and understand how they are. One of my exes was a SERIOUS Gift Giver. That's so alien to me, cause that's never been big for me. Yeah I like receiving gifts...but I'm not used to it. And that was the #1 way he showed that he cared. Drove me insane. He also didn't understand how I was. Another was totally Acts of Service, which is TOTALLY NOT ME. He also didn't really show much emotion, or like to talk about his feelings, and wasn't HALF as touchy-feely as me. So needless to say, that put a SERIOUS damper on the relationship. My mother is totally Words of Affirmation, along with a few other female friends I know. Most of the guys I know are Physical Touch and Quality Time.  Fyre and Ten are both Physical Touch, Words of Affirmation, and Quality Time, no wonder they're so freaking happy together. But as usual, it all depends on the person. What's YOUR love Language? I'm out for now. Audi 5000.  Remember All the World's a Stage,and Thespians ALWAYS do it on Stage.

      Things that make you go hmmm... Bill Cosby went ballistic on a topic that is considered somewhat contriversal, the ignorance and illiteracy of todays black youth- and their parents. Basically he told a lot of people about their complacency and their lack of ambition in the right areas.  (You can read about it here: http://entertainment.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=162979) Personally I TOTALLY agree. But things won't change til people recognize that there IS a problem and then decide to change them.  Relationships.  Soulmates.  America's Government.  Hate.  Love.  Ok, I'm through for now. I just kinda needed something cause I'm hitting a few snags with my story. It's not writer's block....more so writer's pebble. Ah well, I shall go play a video game and see if that will jog my imagination. Wish me luck! I'm out. Audi 5000.

      Ok, first off, sorry for going so long without blogging. My life has NOT been THAT hectic... I've just been writing more than usual (I'm at a point where I could take the story in more than a few different directiosn which only makes it more difficult because I would like to write them ALL out and see where they lead...) And then a good friend of mine from college we'll call Army came into town yesterday and we hung out.  He was supposed to come into town for my birthday, but couldn't because of his work schedule. We grabbed food (bbq at Famous Daves, yum yum) and saw Shrek 2. Which is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen. I was laughing so hard I was almost crying. Then we played video games til 5 in the morning. Yeah. We were being dumb, but it was fun. He knows me a little TOO well though. He made the following predicions for my life.  1. You will get the job that you're looking for, but not until I leave on an unplanned trip, and when I get said job and move, I'll find my soulmate. 2. I'll be married by 26.  We shall see. Considering I just turned 24...I'm supposed to get married in less than 2 years? Following that, I'd have to be meeting or already know who I'm supposed to marry. uummmmm.....didn't know all that. He HAS been fairly right about my life thus far. (ok, he's been fairly exact) So once again, we shall see.  Update on Fyre and Ten, according to her they are still madly in love with one another. They had their LONGEST seperation the other day (it was about 36 hours apart) and when they saw each other all they did was cuddle and hug and look into each others eyes, and profess over and over how much in love they are. (gag me with a shovel) How sickening can you get? Oh yeah, they'll be married by X-Mas 2005. It's actually kind of sweet though. I mean being blindsided by your true love. She was telling me that her moms didn't exactly totally approve of Ten (she wants Fyre to have everything she didn't, including marrying into $$$, according to her, you can fall in love with a rich man as readily as a poor man, but Fyre's mom isn't a gold digger or anything like that. She just doesn't want her to struggle. I love Fyre's mommy just like my own.) But has admitted that she was putting what SHE wanted on her daughter. Fyre was really stressing about that. But now that her moms (at least) won't voice any problems with Ten, Fyre's on cloud 30.   Me on the other hand, I'm still single, still working on this story, still looking for a job, and still trying to have a little fun. Oh, you guys might find this amusing. I forgot to tell one of my roomies that Army was coming in town, she saw his truck parked in the driveway and began freaking out, and basically sat in her car til she could get ahold of me, calling her man, our landlord, her father, her stepfather, her mentor, her cousin, and a few other people. I called her back when the movie got out. She was fairly tiffed. But hey, I didn't realize she'd trip about that. Ah well, she can curse me out later (and she already began)  Well, that's all for my life at this time. Any questions or comments can be directed here. Audi 5000

       Ok...let me take that back, maybe I have, and I've broken my promise. I said when I began the blog that I would try to not go longer than a day or two in between posts. I kinda, sorta went a lil beyond that this time, and I apologize. :( I guess I should fill everyone in on what's been going on... Let's see, this Friday, I take my baby brother to college. AWWWW! Yes I realize he's almost 18, but he'll always be my baby brother. so there :P Beyond that...I'm working my butt off at work (customer service...ick) Yesterday was my first day off in a few weeks. And it's continuing. I've got a double shift tomorrow....and next monday, and in between then, I work every day. fun....reguardless, family stuff is ok, roommates are ok, although one of them went home (to Oklahoma) for the next 3 weeks...House is a lil lonley without her tho...Beyond that....ummm....hmmm. I think that may be it. Haven't been dating, got poisoned the other day, I was SOOOO sick, and had to go to work anyway. I'm all better now :) Went to the Prince concert last nice. *Sigh* Prince is AMAZING, even though he's the same age as my mother, I wanted to break him last night *grrrrr* It was a good thing I went home alone, cause if somebody had been with me...let's just say that they would have been VERY happy (and exhausted), but lucky for somebody, I was alone. If you can find tickets to his tour. The show was phenomenal both musically and visually. I want his tailor and I'd LOVE to go shopping in his shoe closet. He played my favorite song (Let's go Crazy) and that was it for me. I screamed myself into a headache, and I NEVER act like that. ah well, I must go,  byee!
