      Another of those working days, those dreary sultry afternoons and then cold, rainy evenings. Weekend was far away. The short walk down the lane and eventually down the memory lane was sweet and inspiring. As I slowly made my way back home, can I call it a home?? Oh !! well !! home is where the heart is, let me call it home as long as I live in that rented apartment. The smell of coffee wafted in the air and I involuntarily moved towards it, as though my feet had a mind of their own. The place was teeming with people as was always the case, and the payment counter was hardly visible. But I knew my way around having dropped in here occasionally for breakfast. Coffee was a disappointment judging by the aroma that was so very inviting. 		But then disappointments are so very much a part of life that the very word expectations better cease to exist. Hardly anything meets the ever increasing filters of satisfaction. We make sure that we do find a flaw in something which at the first instance may appear all so perfect. Dinner was a tough task, cooking not being one of the priorities now-a-days. It never was.  A packet of maggi will suffice. What a relief that stocks still were available at home. I still wonder how software professionals like me would have survived if “maggi” wasn’t there or wasn’t as widely available as it is now. “Maggi” has indeed averted a major crisis.  Ouch !!! Why do I invariably burn my fingers each time I tried cooking. As though the vessels nursed a grudge against my very use of them. Judging by the odd shapes that they had become and the burns they had suffered, its enough they weren’t already on a strike.  I could see layers of dust on the electronic gadgets at home. Not that I cared, but somehow it didn’t seem appropriate when someone dropped home. It had been days since anyone had visited me. My meeting friends too had been restricted to office and then just a chat on the mobile, technology ah !! One of the ads- ‘Nokia. Binding people’!!! Mobiles have led me to total self inflicted seclusion, encouraging the lethargy which had taken a stronghold. Hadn’t met old friends for ages now. Was ‘bound’ to them through technology though. Call up, discuss what’s up in life, then promise to meet sometime soon, even if the other party is hardly interested and doesn’t make an effort to appear so, add excuses of being ever so busy with work and then hang up. Office hasn’t been hectic at all lately. My space and pace at work.  Evening comes and I promise to pamper myself, by getting something new to wear to office tomorrow. Drop into one of those posh shopping malls. Look around, judge a few of the latest in trendy wear. Where was the price tag?? I got it. What??  Have a look at the material and the garment once more. It didn’t seem worth the price quoted. How do these people come up with such ridiculous costs?? My depleting salary account was hardly encouraging to indulge in this. May be next time, next month. May be after the hike this year.   The rickety auto did nothing to pep up my spirits. Two years in a job which had so many envious back home, and I still did not own a vehicle of my own. But again laziness took the front seat. Convinced me that driving was a tough task in a crowded city and I better stick to such taxis and autos. Just pay and rest in the back seat while driver bore the tension.  		FM played soothing hindi oldies. They still are so enticing. I went back to those days when DD aka our very own Door Darshan was the only entertainment or rather the only available channel. Sunday evenings were special with movies coming up sharp at 5:30 in the evening. Mom used to get very busy the whole day. Think she got up with a mission on Sundays. She used to disappear into the kitchen and reappear after several hours of the act all in sweat and tire. Sunday lunches and dinners were special, not to forget the breakfast. Think she used to cook all three meals in a jiffy. A short nap after the delicious lunch and get ready to watch ‘Vikram-Betal’ followed by the much awaited movie. Dad used to be the guide and search engine to get the name of the actors and actresses on screen. My sis replaced the search engine soon. Sad she could not major in the subject. The whole family sitting together, dad and mom sipping tea, each one of us glued to the TV. We were told we were too young to have tea or coffee. Dad got hysteric last time when he saw the size of my coffee mug. I have a one of similar size back home now as well. Dad made sure he got one for me so that I can have my fill when I am home. The screen is alight and the mascot for Gemini studios comes up. What excitement in the air. Now we were going to move a muscle only during the interval the movie provides. The advertisements looked equally enticing. Hey….was that my apartment I just passed. The auto screeches to a halt. The lane ahead looked tempting. The breeze was cool. I could see numerous elderly couples already out on a stroll. Wasn’t it already past my routine time for a walk. I better catch up.

      Well,well,well !! Finally I sit writing, or rather giving a vent to the richer, deeper feelings within. Had been toggling with the idea of penning down these myriad feelings for quite sometime, but the idea of expressing it in words and then shelving it somewhere, hiding from human pry is indeed a tough task leading me to destroy the same, till of course I thought of going public with it. Opening it to 100s and 1000s, to share and read the words I scatter on a piece of paper. Scatter is it?? Or rather the words I bind and give a meaning to…….  After rave reviews of the movie ‘Yuva’, sat down to watch it. Formed an opinion of my own and went around distributing it. True we go to the theatres to shed so much of the weight we carry the whole day through, and the same naked, ruthless, ugly reality teases us hard in those large sheets of fantasy, rolling on as we, wish…..wish madly that it will weave magic and turn that ugly toad to a dashing prince, the same rolls with which we associate so much of the fun and frolic, we could never afford in life, not to mention the running around trees and cooing to the music, for all such of us, it’s been a big disappointment.  Was lying in bed after that thinking of all those women who really had or are leading the same life as portrayed by Rani Mukherjee in the aforesaid movie, I just could not drive her out of my subconscious. Try as much as I can, I go back to her, try to feel the pain she must have endured. Why do women have this unforgiving and enduring nature?? Giving up all for the man in their life, all?? Yes all!! Needless to mention they have so little. Ah!!! Men in Black, do not react….. I am not an alien….feminist may be!!! I loved the ‘Hate mail’ for chain mails doing the rounds in the ever boring lives of the software engineers. Wish to write one on similar lines for all those forwards as well which depict the agony of a married man. Indeed agony. Made me smile nevertheless. Men ah men, thou bloats in vain!!!   What was that?? so shrill, oh yeah …its my alarm clock !!! Another of those stealthy days, wake up blurry eyed, fumble for the geyser switch, hold on, it’s India, geyser too is a luxury, forget central heating systems. And then set out in hunt for something appropriate to wear to office in that ever increasing pile of clothes. Wait for auto amid the aroma of idlis and sambar being devoured nearby by similar salaried class, wafting in the air is the intoxicating smell of white mogra garlands. A jerk and we shift to reality, and get used to rejection, which is so very ingrained in the daily routine. No I am not speaking of interviews, though if I think of it now, this too is an interview of its own kind. Wave a hand at the auto driver, wishing, hoping he sees you and then eagerly peep inside to mention your destination. Hold your breath, as he surveys you, casts a glance judging you from head to toe and then weighs his options. Well, some categories that comes to their mind probably- 1. The distance isn’t much and will not get me a fast buck, but the ferry is interesting, that red lipstick shines so bright. 2. Ah!! Good start, far to go, lets go, lets go, lets go!! 3. Male ferry, who is interested and the distance isn’t much. 4. Why did this not so attractive female wave a hand for me, hey I eye a better one ahead. Hey! Presto!!A nod of the head….. I saw it, did you?? No?? Never mind I did!! Hop in and relax as the meter ticks away and the office building looms large in view. Couldn’t I have an everlasting childhood, warm sunny days and cool breezy nights. Rhymes to learn and games to play.
