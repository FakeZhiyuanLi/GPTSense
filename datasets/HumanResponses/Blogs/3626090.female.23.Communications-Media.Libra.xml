      Last summer I read the book, The Devil Wears Prada, which was about this recent college graduate who wanted to make it in the magazine business and started working for this rude editor at a magazine named  Runway . (Though a lot of people believe it was based on an editorial assistant's job at  Vogue , but that's hush hush.) At this job, the editorial assistant was given many duties - none having to do with what her hard earned degree from NYU earned her. She was asked to go get coffee, interview nannies for the Editor in Chief's kids, wrap Christmas gifts and a bunch of other personal things, not related to the magazine business. Thinking this would get her a good letter of recommendation to later leave and work for National Geographic, she put up with it. Anyway, last summer I interned at a local Florida magazine, where my devil wore Channel, from her eye glasses down to her 5 inch, leopard print heels. My job there consisted of menial interviews, transcribing, answering phones, coffee (at times) and gathering images and info for the stories the writers were working on. It seemed like heaven compared to the job described in the book I was reading at the time. But today....Today at my job, where I work in PR for FIU, my co-worker, who has somewhat of a boss status, but can never tell me what to do w/o my boss' consent, is stressing out. This lady stresses out for everything! You tell her she has a phone call from a station, and although she's great at what she does, she might run around the office in a frenzy before getting down to it. Well, we have a huge event coming up next week so obviously she is completely stressed out! (which we're all aware of because she says it every 5 mins.) But if she was stressed, you'd think she'd be at her comp. pounding at the keys getting it done. She is, but at times she's just chismiando with the rest of them. Anyways, she comes up to me and says, "Michelle can I ask you for a favor and you won't hate me? It's that I have a lot of work to do." I say "ok what do you need?" "Can you take my daughter downstairs to get a sandwhich." ME:"uumm sure I guess" Her: "Ok but she has to go soon."  So just to aggrivate her a little I wait 45 mins. bc now she has interrupted my plans to go eat w/ my co-worker frineds. But I managed to still eat with them. The question here is: Why the fuck do we do this stupid shit at work, only to think it'll get us ahead? Why don't we notice it doesn't get us ahead one bit! Yes we have to serve our 'dues', just like everyone else before us has. But make me pay my damn dues with something work related. Make me do stupid calls, not get your daughter lunch! Is it take your bratty daughter to work day? HELLO NO! The girl comes every day like if this is a day care! Argh.. why does this slightly bother me? No idea... but this devil wears... uumm Old Navy? I don't even know where it's from. But yes.. til when must I be paying these stupid so called dues everyone keeps telling me about? It's been 2 years and I feel like I'm backtracking instead of going forward. FRUSTRATION! What will my next Devil have on?

      This weekend I saw Runaway Jury and My Boss' Daughter. First, My Boss' Daughter.. what a horrible movie! Where was the humor in that? I have no idea. I don't have a freaking clue why that was under comedy bc it did not bring out one chuckle out of me. (I am easily amused most of the time.. but in the 2 hrs.. not one chuckle!)  As for Runaway Jury, it's going to have a take 2. The parts I saw seemed great, interesting, suspenseful. But I kept dozing off. Oh the wonderful perks of watching a movie alone... living the single life!  Slightly funny story: On Saturday night after my little rage that I decided to stay home, I am on the phone w/ my friend RJ as I'm driving to Blockbuster to make it a Blockbuster Night once again. (I am beginning to think they know me by name over there). But, I do need to find a BBN buddy, someone to just watch movies w/! Please send applications over.. romantic comedies and scary movies are a must in your viewing pleasure category. Anyway, a car pulls up next to me with a rather attractive looking guy driving. He is staring out the window into my car. And I think.. ok what.. do I have something wrong, is something wrong with the car, is he just staring into space? But he moves up and contiunes to stare back to my car. I tell RJ, "OK a cute guy in the car next to me is staring what do I do?" It must have some fight or flight thing bc I didn't think of talkign to the guy. So I hang up w/ RJ and the cute guy next to me points at his cell phone, so I lower my window, to which he keeps pointing at his cell in response. I say, "WHAT?" His reply was, "Me puedes dar tu numero?" And I said, "Nope sorry" and with that put my window right back up. I don't know if this is too picky and maybe I'm not in the best position to be so picky, but why did he speak to me in Spanish? I still don't understand! He was driving a nice car, dressed nice, why Spanish as the first language? That was a complete turn off.. which might seem strange, being that my family is Cuban. But oh well... picky picky picky as can be.

      For those of you who have been asking where my blog was all weekend? Well, he was at the beach with me tanning on Saturday. With all my cousin's and the significant others. Pathetic, yes I know! Do not remind me! Best part was.. they're all younger than me. And on Friday, he was prob drunk along with me at another family get together. The weekend got crappy so the blog went on strike for a while. Hope you enjoyed today's entry. I'll try to liven him up and make him make you laugh again.

      TRUST--- what a simple little word, yet it carries so much meaning. It has been the one that keeps sticking out in my head for the past week. It affects so many of our actions. Without trust, can you advance in your career? Without it, can you fall in love? Without it, can you rely on those you care about 100%? Probablly not. Trust is the base of everything.  Today someone very close to me was backstabbed by someone at work. He was over heard by someone while he was talking to a co-worker and said something regarding a certain race to his co-worker but meant it about himself and the person who over heard him reported him to HR and he was fired for nothing. Right after recieving a huge promotion last week based on his job! And the person who reported him you ask? Someone he was close to in the office, who would joke around with him and talk everyday. Something so ridiculous. Has the world really lost all sense of humor? I don't believe there is one race out there who has never said a joke about another race whether it be black, irish, hispanic, jewish, or anything else... all have been mocked and all have mocked. I say--Lighten up a little! If it wasn't directed at you, move on! Why ruin someone's career for your low self esteem. It's shit, it's what it is! It pisses me off so much! Trust is at the base of relationships. Without it, can you truly reach any type of intimacy? Whether it be physical or spiritual. If you don't trust the person your with completely, can you move on to that level where your truly yourself? It's really hard to let people in and see your true self. It opens you up to vulnerability, which no one feels comfortable with. But when you begin a relationship or you see youself far too deep into one, step back and think, if you trust this person with your entire being because without it, a lot of things come to a stop.   **On another note: I finally found the Josh Gracin CD yesterday. And since this is my blog I can say anything I want.. but if you're even curious to country music--GO BUY IT! It is the best country cd I have heard in a long time. And I'm a huge fan. He doesn't sound like a rookie or developing artist.Some songs are serious.. some are funny and all are great to sing along to. There is not one song on the CD I did not like. With that I say: GO JOSH GRACIN!!! (2nd Josh on the blog in a week) And with that I leave you with a glimpse of one of his songs... **  Endless Helpless Hoping   Let me understate how I adore how I admire and more And walk a hole in the floor Like a fast freight train screaming through the dark  Making a penny in my heart  And that's just where it starts  My lonely nights turn to days My lonely days turn to how my life is going  Endless Helpless Hoping I can dream and I can believe  But you're the only one who can heal  This heart that's broken  Endless Helpless Hoping  All the words that I write just don't impress  They don't leave my nest like me it's a mess I try to tell you but you tell me that  You're my friend how could I let that end  So I just you love him ***

      Yesterday a friend of mine asked on his blog if anyone knew where Regis was. Regis, was missing on the Regis & Kelly show, (one of my personal favorite shows, I might add). He was replaced with Randy, American Idol judge, as a stand in host for the day. This morning as I was getting ready to come to work, Regis was back on the show. He was talking about his absence from the show yesterday. Apparently he was in Washington hosting an award ceremony for the Health Channel. Regis said that his son, who works in WA. asked him if he wanted to go visit soldiers who had been hurt in the war at the hospital. And what did they do? They spent the day going to the rooms of those soldiers who had been hurt. This morning Regis showed pictures of himself with these brave men and women. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, young men with legs blown off, arms missing, a former Notre Dame women's basketball star with a missing arm. It just made me think about what these soldiers must be going through. It's already been about a year and a half and we're still there, still fighting, they're still risking their lives, still in danger. Though most of us hear news on the war and at times shrug it off because we have become so immune to it, these brave people are DYING, and returning home with PERMANENT injuries, in order to keep us safe! I think if you know a soldier, or anyone who is there now, send them a letter and thank them or let them know how much you appreciate everything the risked for all of us back home! So to my SPECIAL SOLDIER FRIEND, "I luff ju, THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart, and I am so happy that you're home and safe, that you probably don't even know how much"!    **On a side note, Josh Gracin, a U.S. Marine and former American Idol finalist on Season 2, has been reported to be the #1 top selling debuting male country artist in over 12 YEARS! What an accomplishment! I love Josh! Now that I know the CD is released, I am going to get my copy of it as well. Do you all remember when he sang on stage with his daughter the night he was kicked off, "I'm proud to be an American"? I know I wasn't the only one crying like a fool in front of the TV that night! So just for that, he won me over and I will go and support this guy and get his CD. GO JOSH!**

      I thought it would be nice to share a realization I had today:  GOD BLESS WELL DRESSED HOT MEN!  WOOOOOOW! I love it when guys who usually dress scrubby all of a sudden surprise you and look like they just jumped out of a J. Crew or Banana Republic catalog. Seems like the world IS all good in the end! Definitely made my day! God Bless them once again...

      At lunch today, one of my co-workers was complaining about this guy and his sporadic attempts at communication. We all agreed it was the three day rule, which was accomplished, followed by the one week rule.  My question is, what is with guys and this 3 day rule anyways? Don't they know they're not being slick and all of the female population is already well aware of it? Come up with something new! We know it's all a part of your "game" and keeping us guessing. But what's the game when we are already aware of your plan. We just expect it 3 days later. Then later on in the day, my boss starts yelling from her office because she received an email containing great news on a story we're working on. Then she's trying to decide what to reply, and the only man in the office says, "Wait until tomorrow and then email them back." My boss answers, "OK but what should I say tomorrow?" I jump in and say, "This isn't a relationship, they're not dating, why does she have to wait until tomorrow." To which my boss hysterically starts laughing and the only man once again says, "I don't know, just wait for tomorrow to answer." Men, we'll never understand their thinking patterns! And I'm still baffled on, what's with the waiting, huh?

      One of my horoscopes for today says:  It is up to you to take the initiative and make things happen. If you sit around waiting for others to make the first move, you won't get anywhere and the day will be wasted.  Libra is a Cardinal sign and that means you have leadership qualities, so what are you waiting for? Others will follow you if you show them the way.   Another says: You're the consummate host, the perfect date, the most generous friend and the best worker.  But when it comes to love, providing everything is the worst thing you could provide. Let others show you what they've got.    Both seem rather fitting for today! SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT, DAMNIT! That's what I say. Can't we be greedy once in a while?

      Last night I get an e-vite for another family shing-ding this weekend. Thank the Lord this one will be minus all the insane family members. A gathering of the young ones ages 20-32, add beer, music, dominoes... can't be too bad can it? At least those are on my side. It's Us vs. Them! They are the insane family members! We, we are the fun drunken young ones! Long live the young generation! This time, no speeches, (oh and yeah, I got out of that last one)what a wonderful life. I would also like to announce that I FINALLY saw the Ring last night... and majically survived! All of you who were terrorizing me, it was scary, but not as bad as I was expecting. A lil gross, yeah, I'll give you that. Good movie, if you haven't seen it, go rent it. Thanks again Ball for lending it to me. And special THANKS to ML for keeping me company through the movie ;). It was fun.  **Check back on here later, I'll be more inspiring, I PROMISE! Too much to think about right now, to me humorous!** I also had a suggestion from ML to add some current event stuff on here. If your interested, let me know. It may be a possibility. Though I'm not promising the news. Might just make fun of it. {Except for the Chino in Iraq, God Bless that man!}

      Translation: MY DRUNKEN FAMILY!  Yes you read correctly, not only did I have way too many mojitos (and anything else that was in site after those ran out) but so did the rest of my family. What happens when you join about 80 drunken cubans together and add music? Well, when you're around my family there's no real answer to that question. Everytime, it amazes me the insanity that goes on! Let's start off a few weeks back when I found my only other single cousin was staying in Boston and not coming dow. I quickly got in touch with him and said, "I can not believe you are leaving me alone for this! You have to be there so we split the questions in half. By you not going, it will all be me!!" To which he replied, "Sorry, I have to miss this one. Can't be the date at this party." Yes my friends, my cousin and I always seem to be eachother's dates for these things. So just as I predicted, once we were about to sit for dinner, his step dad pulls me aside and he's like, "So what's up?" I say, "Nothing, waiting to find out if I'm going to give the speech." He says: "No with you, how's everything?" To which, of course I think, how's school/work/life/family, but apparently I was wrong. I answer, "School's fine, should be done in Dec. and still working at the same place." He says, "No, no what's new? Do you have a boyfriend or something now? Who are you dating?" My response is, "I told J(his stepson) I was going to kill him if I started getting this question and he wasn't here to get them as well." To which he laughs and says, "No that's good, that's good. Don't rush it, the more you wait, the better the guy will be when you find him." I go "Oh really, is that how it works? I probablly just get pickier and pickier the more I wait." He says, "No look at ML (The graduate cousin we were there for), she waited and found herself an amazing guy." So my cousin, ML over hears this and she decides to add, "Yea the more you wait, the better they get because then you want the guy who studied, has goals and makes you happy." (As if I'm not already searching for that! LOL) So I basically ended up getting a 10 minute speech on how waiting for the PERFECT GUY is the right thing to do.  I wonder if it was the state of drunkeness at the time, but did niether of them realize that this PERFECT MAN does not exist! They all have some flaw. But all in all, it made for a good story, and my cousin's dad, who rarely talks, ended up giving me a 'LESSON' in love and life!  Now for my drunken family... what could have gone on that didn't? People had to go shower in the middle of the party because it was so disgustingly hot, beer bottles broke, mojitos were all consumed before midnight, families met and everyone got along, just like in one of those Chevy Chase movies, minus the drunken grandma! As I think about it now, you can tell when people belong together, when your cousin's girlfriends or boyfriends fit in with your family, just like if it was their own. With all their faults, I would not trade these crazy, random people for the world.  So being that you now see the state I was in on Saturday night, it is why yesterday, I went without submitting anything on here. The effect of those delicious mojitos & few Coronas were still living in me!

      Just want to say THANK YOU to all of you who have been commenting. Apparently, yesterday's topic was quite popular amoung you guys! One great person, CG, even compared me to Carrie Bradshaw. WOO HOO what an honor! Although, I don't think I live up to it. But as long as I provide you with a little chuckle, my job here is done!  For those of you reading my stuff, don't be so selfish and give my buddy RJ some love too. Visit his site! You can find his link to the left of my site under "Ricker-Lake".

      This morning I wake up to the noise coming from my alarm at 11 am. For those of you who know me know what a miracle it is for me to be up before 3pm on a Saturday morning. The reason for this was because I had to be at Starbucks at noon to meet my new 'magazine friend', who ED2010 put me in contact with. We are planning an ED2010 in Miami... so if any of you are interested in meeting some local editors, please join, I'm in charge! (Visit wwww.ed2010.com for more info. on who they are). We spoke about life and the wonderful wonders of job hunting (more on that on another post when I have more time). We are planning a happy hour for July 7th! So if you want, join us! YAY - Drinks, drinks drinks! Next, off to find my dad a Father's Day gift...cologne is what he wanted, so he got my favorite one ever! (Kinda odd to give my dad the cologne I love to smell on guys!)But oh well, don't have a guy to smell it on, might as well give it to daddy, at least he gives me hugs.  Now, I'm rushing through this because I have to be out of here soon and off to my cousin's GUAYABERA themed Master's graduation party. How more hispanic does it get? Apparently, I'm the public speaker in my family (they seem to over look that though I might be outgoing, I am terrified of crowds staring at me) because I have 'won' the honor to give a speech on my cousin tonight. I'll let you know how it goes, hopefully after a few mojitos, it'll all be good. (Or I'll completely embarass myself but will be too drunk to notice). This is why I have to get there early and become friends with the bartender they hired. So with that, I say..."MOJITOS, HERE I COME!"

      I have come to the conclusion that every single person I know is either married, might as well be married, in a long term relationship, engaged, or just started dating. Are there any single ones left out there? Anyone to go to happy hour with without having to be the God damn 3, 5th, 7th (pick any odd #) wheel in the group? Just this week, I call up a friend of mine to invite him to my cousin's HUGE graduation party. (There's a freaking tent and everytyhing in her backyard for this.) Anyway, being that every single family member is w/ someone, I invite a good friend of mine, since he has also become my cousin's friend through the years. Anyway, conversation goes something like this: ME: hey I was told to invite you to the party on Saturday, want to go? HIM: WOW she's graduating already? Sure. Who'll be there? ME: You know, me, my family, her friends... same people you always see. I need a dancing partner so let me know. HIM: uumm Ok, Saturday sounds good. ME: Don't forget you have to wear a Guayabera, it's the theme of the party. HIM: oh ok... Can I bring my Boyfriend? ME: BOYFRIEND? since when do you have a Boyfriend? HIM: Oh we've been dating for a few weeks now, just recently became a lil more serious. ME: Sure, I mean if it's your BOYFRIEND how can you not. HIM: OK give me the details later. **WE hang up** In my head I think... great... don't even have my gay friend as single anymore! What has the world come to? Another wheel at the party, that's what!

      Well.. let's say I wanted to be at THE BEACH TODAY!! Being that I have wonderful Friday's off and have yet to go to the beach! I am now also taking applications for someone to go to the beach with next Friday. Today's topic is EXes. Don't you just love your EX? After 3 different conversation with 3 different people yesterday, I thought that would be a great topic. First, is it possible to just stay FRIENDS with your ex? If your current 'significant other' is still friends with theirs, please be careful. Now, for my personal addition, this person might not qualify as an 'ex' per say, but for this particular argument, let's call him an Ex. Don't you just adore when you bump into your ex's new girlfriend/boyfriend? Earlier this week I was walking around campus with 100 things in my head when I see her. And the stupid bitch has to walk right next to me on a one foot space of walking. We were shoulder to shoulder! ARGH! She is so lucky I didn't all of a sudden get this shock through me that would have sent her tumbling into the bushes! Although I do not want that particular "ex" back, I do NOT want to be that close to his GIRLFRIEND... freaking shit. She knows who I am, could she not have gone around some other way? ARGH! Trapped next to the girlfriend isn't a good place to be! Now my new fear is, am I going to have to share my graduation walk w/ her? ARGH A friend of mine had to do this, I hope I don't. I now understand why P was so upset. (we'll call her P for today to conceal her true identity.) So P and I came up with this theory that there should be an island for EXes. Therefore, whenever you meet someone, you can send their EX to this island. We'll call it.. The Island of the EX. Whenever there's an EX that bothers you, you can just send them to the island far far away and they can all live together happily ever after. THE END

      If I could only comment on your comments w/o posting? Oh the questions of life. Thanks to all of you who have left me messages, they are quite entertaining while sitting at my desk, bored at work, trying to solve the case of my co-workers missing folder. If you see it lying around, please direct it to the Gov. Rel. office! Maybe it's hiding somewhere fun. Hide n Seek.. i love it! Now... "annonymous".. I always figure out who you are. And with a reply like yours, I'd like you to tell me where I could find a person  by such a name? You seem to be the expert, huh? oh where oh where could it be.... possibly with the missing folders? hhmm... that's where I'd hide!

      It's named Ruminations, in memory of Aaron Karo's ruminations which I miss greatly! Maybe that's why the past couple of months have sucked, I need some Ruminating! I hate when people cancel good shit. First Sex In the City, then FRIENDS, and Ruminations, what will I do with all this time? Oh yeah... start a BLOG! Here are some RUMINATING THOUGHTS: ~First, I want to thank a wonderful man, who deserves his entire name on here for such patience w/ me and great work.... ANGEL, thanks for trying to get my article to link to this site! I still owe u a beer for that. ~On Sat. I have a mtg. w/ my new magazine friend I met through ED2010, we are going to start up a Miami chapter, let's see how that goes. I'm also waiting for one more thing, but I'll keep that a secret til it happens, I don't want to jinx anything. ~I'm excited because my class tonight was cancelled! THANK THE LORD, I don't have to stay in the disgusting north campus til 11pm! woo-hhoo... I'd like to celebrate with a movie. Anyone want to go to the movies? Although my great co-worker (let's call her BALL) lent me the Ring today. Now I'm excited, though I refuse to watch that thing alone! I wanted to see Spiderman, but it has disappeared w/ her 'untrusty' friend, so I'll have to wait. She compensated by lending me THE RING. I might end up awake for days if I watch it tonight. ~Did anyone watch that new Ashley Simpson reality show last night? They don't even know what else to make a reality show about anymore. I thought it would be sort of stupid, but found myself laughing at the stupidities she did. When she was trying to clean the house? HAHA I almost died...I don't even think I would be that stupid when mopping a floor. Trying to clean the house w/ SHOUT? Has this girl never done laundrey or seen a TV commercial? Come on, you can't be that much of an air head. Can you? The highlight of the show was her little boyfriend. In case you don't know, I love the name JOSH! I want to name my son Joshua. It all started Soph yeah in H.S. after I read a book named, Joshua. What a beautiful name...too bad it looks like he's only going to last 2 episodes. It must have been her constant verbalizing that she loves him. Do not share your feelings, treat him like shit, they seem to like that. My personal rule is: DO NOT SAY IT UNTIL THE GUY DOES! This girl said "I love you" every 5 mins. of the show.  You're 19, what do you know about love anyway?  ~ Speaking about love... yesterday after work I show up at my house w/ roses. My favorite kind, white with a pink trim. My mom sees them and says, "Hey, where did those come from?" I said, "They're mine." And she goes.. "Oh from who?" My response is, "The little old man in the corner. I bought them." And she goes, "Ah ok." Did she think that suddenly some romantic fool had shown up at my job and brought me flowers? Left them on my car? uumm that does not exist! It's 2004, can't a girl buy  herself some flowers!?!?! According to my cousin, who told me last night that I should walk around w/ a tag that reads: "FRIENDS NEED NOT APPLY" bc she thinks every man I meet, suddenly becomes my new best friend. She shares this with my mom, who finds it the funniest thing she has ever heard. Please, tell me, did I miss the humor?   DISCLAIMER: Thanks to all of you who replied w/ some suggestions. My nice friend AC thinks I should cuss more. See what I mean about how guys like it when you're mean. I promise to work on that, I'll see what I can come up with. CRAP! (is that good enough?)

      So since some of you can't be nice on your comments, I have hid them til I learn how to delete it! I know who you are!!! --- you were the 'author' of the article (Mr. AB).

      Lunch was quite exciting this afternoon, many topics were covered. I'm still not quite sure how this came up but MS asked me if I had any guy friends who were just friends, who I go out with alone and just hand out, but who I have never had a crush on or that I know have never had a crush on me. I quickly answered, "of course I do, a lot actually." She didn't seem to understand this concept. She is convinced that they have to be old family friends or one of us at one point was interested in the other and are just denying it. I was trying to convince her that although hard to believe, men and women CAN be friends, and good ones at that. For some reason MS didn't seem to think this was too possible. I'm convinced it is, and have an array of male friends to prove this. Maybe it's just me, it can all be in my head and men and women can't be friends. I know I wouldn't be too thrilled with my future boyfriend some day have a bunch of 'just girl friends.' I'm not quite sure how I would react to that, yet I love having my guy friends around. Who else can give you the input and advice you need when starting a new relationship? Help you figure things out when they're unclear? Give you some insider's feedback on how the male brain works? And although I think I'm being obvious about so many things, when discussed with another male friend, he quickly reassures me that men don't think about things as much as women do and if you think you're flirting with a guy, you might as well flirt some more, because he hasn't noticed yet. (My conclusion to this is that guys are just slow sometimes and don't notice what they rather not. I like to give them some credit and believe they are pretty smart people.)  For my conclusion: yes, I think men and women CAN be friends, I think we need eachother to learn things about relationships and about life.

      It's one of those days again. The type where I just can't take my job anymore. The alarm rang this morning and I could not get myself out of bed. I would have much rathered a MAC truck coming straight for me, than having to come into this office again today. I swear I am having a breakdown. A midlife crisis of some sort. Maybe it's the urge and closeness I feel when I hear that wonderful, exuberant word: GRADUATION! So close, yet so far away!  While at lunch today and complaining to my co-workers on how much this job sucks, I came up with a wonderful analogy. Here it goes, this is what I feel like: I feel like I am standing in front of a corner wall, the little triangle two walls make when they meet. I feel like I am walking right into it, over and over. The minute I take a small step back and get a little room from my face and the way (well, that's a good day at work) when I feel I can breathe. Then the second I take another step forward... BOOM!  My face slams right into the wall again.  That is exactly what I feel like working here.

      Crappy days are offically the worst! Anything that can go wrong will, and you're in no mood for it either. My highlight of the day was lunch with my brother's girlfriend. We talked and were able to get out of the office, which makes anything and everything SOOO MUCH BETTER! Then I go back to work, and everything is great. The boss is in a good mood, I actually have work to do today that I like, and I got some nice little visitors too. And then stupid things start to piss me off!  Maybe it's just one of those days. Maybe I should've listened to my body and stayed home in bed today watching Ryan Seacrest or something. Now to sit in a stupid class til 9! ARGH. I need salvation tonight! What can save me?  To top it off, I'd like to say the stupid things FIU comes up with PISS ME OFF! Ex. # 1: I need 4 more little classes to finally get the hell out of this hell hole and graduate, but of course that's impossible around here. 3 of the 4 classes I need are offered. So I will probablly end up staying here an extra semester for no good reason. Like I didn't have better plans set for myself for 2005! GEEZ!  Ex. #2: I get to the crap of all crap, Biscaybe Bay campus. Which, have I mentioned how much this campus grosses me out? It needs some painting and landscaping or something! Well, I go get the ticket for the shuttle and they ran ou tof $2.50 tickets. I go to the lady: "so how would you like me to get back? Where can you make more tickets?" "Oh, I'm sorry that office is closed so buy the $20 ones I guess." I had $3 with me and I told her this! So I had to go to the stupid ATM to buy a life supply of stupid bus tickets because this damn school is so unorganized that they ran out of tickets! I wonder what the other 50 or so students who take the shuttle from now til 9:30 are going to think about that!   Toodles.....

      I woke up this morning, wishing I could send the world to hell. Which, I think I managed to do to my mom in the 15 mins. I was awake and home before I had to rush to work. My poor mother, she's amazing, but the things she puts up with.&nbsp; Yet, I swear to her I'm being nice. I think I'm just moody. I spent all of last night sick and feeling like total ass. I didn't want to miss work, because god those $40 a day make such a big difference in my tiny, little bank account.  I get to work and my boss says, "Wow are you sick? You don't look to well." I said, "Yeah I feel like total crap, I don't know why I came in, but I'm here, thinking it might go away." To which she responds, "Oh ok I'm sorry, but hey can you clean out that office sometime soon, so I can move back in it?"  GREAT... just peachy! That's exactly what I wanted to do-- clean the damn office! That office has been used as a 'storage and crap yard' since my boss moved out of it a year ago, but now she's being replaced and must move back into the office.  This just adds to my shitty things to do at work list! I swear, no one warned me of the crap I'd eventually end up doing here when I was hired! I was told it would be 'assisting with media, writing press releases, some editing and making media calls.' All of which I've done at some point, (and I love it when I get to write things!) but no one told me about the cleaning the office, feeding the daughter and all of that other crap!  God ... GOD, GOD I want a new job! Desperately! I am sick of paying my dues! Have I not paid enough? I mean.. just take out this 'due payment' out of my shitty salary and let me get a REAL JOB! Someone, if you're reading this:  HIRE ME!  I WILL WRITE FOR FOOD/MONEY!  I'm attempting a new job, and have come the conclusion that when emailing a possible employer, you kinda move into the 'business flirty' talk. Where you say how good you are and why this person needs you and can't go through another work day without you! You defend yourself, prove youself and make youself sound 150% better than what you know you'll ever do. But it's all promises.. when you get there--you might just be cleaning out an office! Finding a job, just like finding a good man, takes a deal of courting, flirting and promising. Keeping the promises is all up to you once you get it. Or once you learn how much of the promises to keep until you realize you need a raise in order to perform better.  My crappy sick feeling today has left me in an utter stage of confusion. I want sleep, I want a new job, I don't feel like going to class tonight. Confusion is: what will I do the rest of this day?

      This weekend I hung out with some friends I don't usually get to spend time with and to my surprise met a new possible future frined. I love meeting new people! I think by definition I am a people person. I find it interesting and in some geeky way exciting when you start learning about someone new. What scares them, what they like, what they do for entertainment, their beliefs. People are so different, and for some reason this intrigues me every time. I guess that's the same perk to starting a new relationship... the exciting begining stage where everything is a mystery and everything can be exciting. Now back to the hanging out with friends- I realized that I am sick of going out! I am only in my early 20s and I can say I am offically sick of the beach party scene, the grove bar scene. What else can I do? I want to sit home and have someone to watch a movie with. (Lately that has been my mom, yes I am admiting it on the internet.) I want to go to friends' houses (like I did on Friday) have a nice drink- have some wine, talk, laugh and enjoy eachother's company in complete comfort. I even brought up the idea to some friends to take turns hosting 'dinner parties' because I think I am about to go on a hiatus from the beach and the grove. Lately I think my parents go out more than I do. What is up with me? Just fucking tired of the beach!! I need to find a new form of entertainment, that's for sure.

      I just realized today that John Edwards' accent is quite sexy and attractive in a country boy sort of way. He has now won my attention, he can now do his political baffle baffle... I'm all ears.  Who is the new hot (in a dorky way) anchor on Channel 7 news? I particularly do not like to watch Ch. 7 news at all, but with this guy reporting things to me, I might just tune in. He's dorky cute, glasses and all. And no I'm not talking about Craig Stevens, I'm talking about that new guy. What's his name? I'm curious. Might have to write Ch. 7 an email thanking them for my personal viewing pleasure.  Did you hear.. The Heat got Shaq! Woo -Hoo! Maybe now people will start going to thier games. Sorry Lakers, Shaq is now in Miami. I also heard he might be the one who bought that $15million dollar house in Star Island. Let's see if he helps out the Heat for next season.... GO MIAMI!  Question: Why is it that whenever Ch. 7 tries to get sport fans reactions to things going on, they interview people at Shula's bar/restaurant? They spent the whole world series there! Is Shula's right next to the news station or something? Do they realize that there are plenty of other sports bars in Miami where they can go interview different people? Stupid Ch. 7!! But thanks for the new cute anchor.

      Yesterday was such an odd day. I was going insane at work, wanted to kill someone by merely 3pm. You know how there's always that one person at work that completely irritates the fuck out of you? Even on a good day when they're trying to be really nice to, you still get irritated and you can't control it because they are just annoying as shit? Well, mine is playing boss this week. My lord, I can't wait for my real boss to get back! I WANT TO SCREAM! So after this complete shit day of doing menial tasks and being repeated what to do over and over in a matter of 5 mins, while I was working on the proj. I was able to escape. Except, my escape was to north campus to attend class. As soon I got outside I saw the major nice Florida SUMMER THUNDER STORM that was pouring down. Only to realize I had no umbrella, my car was on the 5th floor of the garage, where the umbrella was, so it was pointless to go get it and get soaked in the process, so I did what any girl would do. I took the long way through the garage to run to the bus stop and get wet as little as possible. Except when I ran for cover in the bus stop, I didn't notice the pool of water that was forming below me, only to step in it and ruin my cute, expensive, pointy, flat pink shoes! ARHGHHH Great addition to a great day! The bus was late 25 minutes. That shit is always early! Giving me 45 mins to spare before class when I get to north campus. The day I need those 45 mins. to do my homework (BC I was watching A Walk To Remember the night before and realized I didn't feel like doing HW)I only get to campus 10 mins. before class. I managed and finished the assigment. While I was standing under the bus stop in the swamp waiting for the bus, and realizing when the bus got there I had to run in the rain again getting annoyed all over again, there was an even bigger annoying girl standing behind me, talking to one of my few originally cuban friends, telling him to call the bus comp again. Then she asked for his phone and began to speak in some Hebrew jibberish. (My Cuban friend was the one who told me it was Hebrew. I was lost and confused and SOAKED!) Boy did I feel bad for him! My question is, if he speaks English, why is it why I speak to him in English, he replies in Spanish, When I Speak to him in Spanish he replies in English? But now let me mention the good parts of the day. As the bus pulled up this nice Chineese guy, who was also enjoying along w/ us calling the bus comp. to complain, offered to walk with me, and offered his umbrella. What a nice "Chino". He has now reversed every negative image I have of the annoying, rude and ungrateful Chineese people you meet in the lines while waiting for the ride at any Disney theme park. He was so nice, I hardly understood his English, but he was dressed like an Abercombie catalog guy. White and red stripped polo shirt, kaki shorts, and matchig red & white flip flops. God bless the nice Chino.  On my ride home from class, I spent it chatting away w/ my Cuban guy friend, another Cuban girl (both of which were born in Cuba) and another friend from class. Spoke Spanish most of the time. A rareity for me. Today I really felt the INTERNATIONAL part of going to FIU.

      I'd like to thank a wonderful person for e-mailing this to me. (LG, I miss you & our analytical chats!) But it was so beautiful, that I want to post it here for the rest of you to see. Sometimes we just need to be reminded of the little things that count and make us as strong as we say and think we are. I really liked the last point.    KNOW YOUR WORTH!!!!!!!!!   · Stay away from OVER-ANALYZING things.  · Don’t take things for granted. Especially your quality time together.  · He can get sex from anyone…that’s not the only reason he's with you.  · Don’t give your whole heart to anyone UNTIL you marry him.  · People change and feelings change.  · You can’t stop someone from leaving.  · If he does leave, it’s HIS LOSS…not yours.  · You can’t stop him from cheating on you.  · If he cheats on you, then he’s obviously NOT WORTH IT.  · Don’t start UNNECESSARY arguments.  · If a fight gets too big that you lose control of the situation---say “we’ll talk about it tomorrow” and LEAVE or HANG UP.  · There’s nothing wrong with asking for and giving reassurance.  · You can’t force things to happen. If it’s MEANT TO BE...it will happen.  · DON’T TAKE THINGS PERSONALLY.  · Don’t punish HIM for the way your ex-boyfriend treated you.  · Don’t overlook the good things he does for you.  · If it doesn’t work out, remember…He’s NOT the only man in this world who will love you.  · Never think that you are not good enough for anyone; always ask yourself if they are good enough for you.

      I just want to vent a little and say how much I fucking hate manipulating people! Not me manipulating them, people trying to manipulate me! ARGH!!! Fucking annoying. If you're going to try to sweet talk someone into doing something, try to sound a bit sincere and be discrete. Fucking stupid obvious people. Just because you try to make something sound good or pretend you actually give a shit about me does not mean I am going to do it any more than I was before that! It actually does the opposite, it repels me and pisses the shit out of me! WOW! If I said no I don't feel like doing it, you might as well give up! I swear the world is run by a mob of manipulators. It's the way people seem to get things they want. Business people manipulate, PR people do too, your boss is the head of manipulators, especially when you get paid shit like I do, and your boss is the utmost manipulating person in you're circle of people I am sure!  Now some music that cheers me up... GOD BLESS JOSH GRACIN!!!! I know I've said that before, but I absolutely love him, therefore I will continue to bless him every chance I get! {The song has a fast fun country beat.. YEE HAW!)  Nothin' To Lose    It was noon time, down time, break time Summertime, Miller Time, anytime  She was looking pretty fine  A red light, green light, go  All fired upside downtown  She was shaking me all around  I was tuned in, going nowhere, second wind  Jonesing, drooling, feeling good, if you would   Chorus:  Oh yeah, by the way she moves She's got me rolling in dirt in a white t-shirt  Breaker Breaker 1-9 she's a big ol' flirt  By now she's got me pretty tied up  Tied down, any way I chose  I got nothin' to lose   In like Flynn, I was  Looking for the win  Just trying anything, hey  Baby, where you been  All my life I've been looking for  Someone like you  Falling head over heels Hey what can I do   (Repeat Chorus)  Bridge:   Now I'm in the fast lane going 98  By now I know she can  Smooth operate me  I know she's no goody two shoes  But hey I got myself nothin' to lose   (Repeat Chorus twice)  Noon time, down time, break time  Summertime, Miller Time, any time  She was looking pretty fine  In like Flynn I was looking for the win  Just trying anything, hey baby where you been  All my life I been looking for someone like you  Falling head over heels hey what can I do  I got nothin' to lose, yeah

      By Noah, I don't mean that guy in the gospel with the big ship and pairs of little animals and creatures of all sorts. I mean the beautiful, sensitive, brave, tough, strong, did I mention gorgeous, man portrayed in the movie The Notebook. I finished reading the novel last week, and tonight finally got around to watching the movie. {Just for the record, the book is better than the movie, but the movie  is  still amazing!}  Anyway, back to what I was saying. Does he exist or is he some mythological image of what we should find or look for in love? This love story made it seem like it is so easy to find a guy that has just about everything you're looking for. Who needs money anyway? I like to believe I don't! I really don't! But I would like for a guy like Noah, to just drop in, just like that. Swing off a Ferris wheel, ask me on a date, take me canoeing with the swans. Ok. Maybe I live in the wrong era, but be romantic just like that. Is it too much to ask for? It has come to my attention that most of the guys lately just want a little bit of play (in male language: "Want to get some ass"). But in a women's world, it just doesn't happen that way. You don't get 'play' so easily, so be romantic damn it! Guys seem not to try anymore and sweep you off your feet. Things are quickly expected early on that should not even be thought of til there's a ring on that pretty, little fourth finger on the left hand. You ladies know what I'm talking about.  I guess watching this movie and reading the novel, just left me hoping that there are still some Noah's left out there. Or at least, if not some, just one. I only need one. I'd like to meet him sometime, stubble upon him as I get through my path in life. Things might be a little more entertaining, a little more playful, a little more ROMANTIC, if we all had a Noah to walk along with. Maybe I am just a hopeless romantic fool who needs a slap across the face to wake me up and tell me that only exists in works of fiction. But in my heart, I know, that that's what I'm searching for, that's what I want. I don't think anyone should settle for less, not even for a "piece of ass", not for money, not to make you family/friends/ or anyone else happy. You should look for, find, be with and love, the one that in your heart "Completes you". As cliche as that may be. The one you can't live without, who you can't imagine your life without, the one who makes you laugh until you cry, who you can stay up til the wee hours of the night talking about absolutely nothing but leaving with it feeling like you were talking about how you'd resolve the world's problems.  So as this dating quest continues, which I vouch is not easy but sometimes amusing, entertaining characters cross along your path, I hope there is a Noah out there and that he exists.

      Ok... I've been getting a lot of complaints for my extreme case of procrastination this week and I AM SORRY! YOu know how "journalists" are.. we procrastinate everything it seems. But honestly, this past wk was insane. Started the ED2010 thing, which went better than I thought. I know love the people at the New Times, God bless their souls! I also had the Med. school press conference at work, so that was a little insane. And the wknd was filled w/ relaxing events, from a family dinner chez moi (not relaxful) to a beach picnic/bbq at key biscaybe w/ the wonderful ID(SODA) ppl from work, to a POKER PARTY, to watching the Notebook. Questionn: What is the deal with the poker obsession? I just don't get the damn thing! I am not amused by it nor entertained, someone please explain. Is it the hype that has everyone thinking it's so great? Celebrity poker, poker websites, poker parties... NO MORE POKER!  Now for the  RULES : I love comments on my blog! Absolutley adore the things. But I have one small request, If you comment, can you please at least initial it (did you forget that was the trend I had going on?) Sometimes I like to or want to reply to the person personally and I don't have a damn clue who you are. So please, initial and I can know you're human!

      A great friend of mine had this wonderful idea to set me up w/ a friend of her brother's. I thought, can't hurt right? Maybe my wheeling around the couples syndrome will be fixed after all. But once we met.. WOW! I'm told I am nit picky when it comes to who I date, I don't know if this is quite true. Can't a girl have some standards anymore?  I mean, yeah I'm single, but I'd like a guy w/ eyes, a mouth, uumm.. a personality maybe? This wasn't the worst set up ever, though I must publicly thank RJ for coming with me as my rescuer. What can a girl do without a guy best friend! My Savior. This so called 'set up,' 'date,' 'meeting,' whatever the hell you'd like to name it, truly did not work. For those of you who know me, you can vouch that I am not a tall girl at all. I mean I stand at MAYBE 5'5ish. Yet this guy I was meeting was shorter than I was. But I thought, ok, he's vertically challenged, maybe he's fun and though we may not fall in love, I can have a single person to hang out with. Other faults I found: He was 29 going on 39, possible 45! My father dresses hipper than this guy. How can I put it, jeans a lil higher than his waist, a nice short sleeve, button down, silk shirt (I exused the silk, it's summer, go for it) BUT the kid tucked it in! Who dresses like this to go to a bar with friends? I let it slide because my friend's boyfriend warned me not to be a total bitch. So I did, we sit down to drink... HE DOESN'T DRINK! And to top it off by 12:30 he was sleepy and wanted to go home! Not my sense of a fun guy what so ever. What was up with this kid? I have yet to figure it out. I'd like to think it wasn't me and that I did not completely repulse this MAN (bc he was almost 30). But for the love of God, can you sit and try to have a good time with your friends. Order a beer, chat for a bit, people watch, forget your damn RAW FOOD DIET! It's Friday night! (We can discuss his Raw Diet theory at another point, email me if your truly curious). By this point I gave up all hope! I'm better of single and enjoying my coupled friends. Who I might add, one lucky couple was stuck with me all of Sunday & Monday. (Thanks for being troopers and letting me be your THIRD WHEEL FOR THE WKND!) After that night, I was happy to be wheeling around my friends. As the Spanish saying goes, "Mejor estar sola que mal acompanada." Translation: "Better to be alone than in bad company." The guy had potential, so if any of you have any single aunts ages 35-45, send them my way, and I promise to set them up with this guy. I think he might be more in their league than mine.  However, I finished reading the Notebook this weekend. My only accomplishment of the 5 days off from work and school. Which led me to think, if love like that does exist, I'll lower my search from my "prince" to simply searching for my "Noah". (Those of you who have seen the movie understand my theory.) Now I'm open to going to watch it myself.  Sometimes being the wheel, isn't that bad after all! (Just dont' want it all the time)

      So this long weekend officially came to an end. And although I did absolutely NOTHING but spend my paycheck on pointless shit I don't need, I still managed to forget I had a huge assignment due for my only class this semester. I miraculously 'remembered' when I returned from KP's house at around 11pm, just to see an email from my Prof. reminding us that it was due this TUESDAY! Holy shit! With all the time I had, how did that slip my mind? Thank God for these class yahoogroups I tell you, truly a freaking blessing! Back to the pointless shit I bought... somehow when I'm bored and have nothing to do, shopping makes me feel so much better. I don't know what it is. It's not the shopping experience bc I went alone, and it's not high end stuff either, because my shopping mostly took place at Target! WOW can you find pointless crap there that seem facinating while you're there, yet, when you get home and notice your big bank account is down to $7.51 that you know you're in big trouble. Thank the Lord for payday weeks.

      I was just thinking if this has ever happened to any of you.... Have you ever been dating someone or casually seeing them and are really interested in them, only for them to later refer to you as "just like a sister", "one of the guys", or better yet, my all time favorite "Best friend"? Are these lines or do we just live on different dimensions of the world? Could it be we view these 'dates' completely differently than these guys or were we just on 2 completely different dates than they were? Hhhmmm.... one of the 7 wonders of the world. Who's up to solving it?

      Yesterday was absolutely wonderful! It started off as just another crappy Tuesday at work and somehow took a turn- for the best. It caught me completely off guard. I've been having such complete shitty days lately, that I just assume it's going to be another day full of crap. But this one just turned better out of the complete blue. Here's the sum up: 1. My boss tells my our V.P. is taking the whole division to Disney World. The extra perk: it's paid for! And he's taking us on a WORK DAY! Thank God I stayed working here, I wouldn't want to miss that trip. 2. I get home and my mom has great news for me. Someone I wasn't expecting and had totally forgotten about called my house. I won't say what it was for, for fear of jinxing it. (You can't help but fear that when things have been so crappy and all of a sudden something good happens.) 3. I get an email from the school of Journalism that the class I was pissed about because they weren't offering, is no longer part of the program. But the class I have to take in it's place is full, but I got myself on a waiting list! So let's hope I get in. 12 credits til I get to walk across that stage and shake ol' Mitch's hand!  On a side note, my cousin got engaged last week! I have been honored with the duty of Maid of Honor. This has been keeping me quite entertained; theknot.com can be quite addicting. My duty for now is: try to find a place to hold the engagement party at and then help planning it. Finally, all those years in a sorority are put to use! Party planning is my specialty, I had quite some practice planning all of those Rush weeks and Mixers. I knew that wasted money would come back to me with a purpose, now I have found it.

      Just last week I went to see  Before Sunset , which I might say I loved. However, I have one favorite scene, and I promise it won't ruin the movie for those of you who are planning to go see it. The scene is when Julie Deply goes on a rage and starts yelling and bitching about all of her past relationships and how they have screwed her up. She goes on and on, on how every guy is so great at first, but then you fall for him and in the end he fucks you over. You're left hurt, sad and scared to fall in love again. Then the next guy that comes along has to deal with all of her shit because she won't trust him as quickly, and then the cycle occurs again all over again. I could not help but sit in the theatre through this whole scene and just say to myslef, "right on sista, that is how it is!" How much truth was in that scene? I absolutely loved it! How many times have we not fallen for this guy who seems perfect, romantic, senstive at first only to find out after a couple dates, he's an asshole just the same. When that poor wonderful guy does come knocking on my door, I might just look at him and say, "ok so how long do I have until you become a jerk?" It shouldn't be this way. We shouldn't be so afraid to fall in love. But sometimes we are. By we, I mean me! It's hard to trust someone and think they're going to stick around for a while. It's hard to think that after your friends and family get to know about him, he'll still be there. By this time, it's usually on the way to the end and doesn't last much longer. Then you have to deal with all the embarassing questions when they ask you, "So how's 'John' are you two serious yet?" To which you have to answer something on the lines of, "Oh 'John", he's just great, but I haven't seen him in a few weeks." That let's them know: 1. it's over between you two 2. you're not some unhappy, miserable single girl and wish 'John' the best 3. never to ask about 'John' again. Oh the dating fun and excitement of a 20-something.

      To my wonderful fans, sorry I have not updated this thing in about a week. Things have been a little crazy. End of the semester, still searching for a damn job I like, my eye turned red again! Stupid contact lenses cut my cornea way back in May. The Doc. told me I could start wearing my lenses again, slowly for a few hours a day, and the second I put them in 2 days in a row, I'm back to square one: red eyes, can't stand the light, and pain! So I had to make an emergency appt. w/ my doc. who told me to go back to my glasses for a few more months. This is total SHIT! I miss my contacts. Everyone is telling me to do the laser surgery, including the doc. who gave me a 20 min. speech on it. But I say, "hell no!" I'm scared shitless to do that. Maybe in a few years I'll change my mind, as of right now, I'm back to the dorky glasses everywhere I go. At least now I can see and sit at the comp. for longer than an hour without feeling the pain.

      I couldn't sleep tonight so while I was flipping through the channels and came across " The Surreal Life " on MTV, though I think this is the stupidest reality TV show ever, I somehow got into it and started watching it. I think it was an old re-run, M.C. Hammer was in it, some other used to be famous people I can't even recognize, and one of my favorite old timers, Gabrielle (she used to be Andrea on 90210). Well, this episode was about 2001's playmate of the year, Brandy. This is the first time I have ever heard of this girl, but you guys who get Playboy all the time, probably know who I'm talking about. The mission for tonight's episode was that all the people in the house had to find Brandy a date so she can go on a blind date with. I think this related to my life and how random people try to introduce me to the perfect guy, yet he always seems to be far from that. This poor girl's date hardly spoke! He was a chef, good looking, good background, yet he had NO CONVERSATION! Now for those of you reading this, don't you hate it when you go on a date and you can't think of one thing to talk about? You start talking about the most odd topics that you know neither of you care about, just to fill up the air with something. She said, to her cast mates, that this guy wasn't for her and she thought he was too aggressive, yet later on in one of those confessional things she said that she's scared to give a guy a chance sometimes for fear that he won't meet all of her expectations. I think this might be my problem! It seemed to sound like a good enough excuse. I have made up this looong checklist in my head that I think the 'perfect guy' should meet, and let me reiterate, it is a mighty long list. I know I wouldn't want to be measured up to a list of it's kind. I know it's unfair, but I keep telling myself I'm looking for good qualities here. At the end of the show, M.C. Hammer,(yes you read correctly) summed it up pretty well, I guess he's the father of love or something. He said, "If you're at the right place, at the right time, the right man will find you." I guess I've just been in a series of immensely wrong places for the past 10 years or so. (10 years, being approximately the "dating age.")
