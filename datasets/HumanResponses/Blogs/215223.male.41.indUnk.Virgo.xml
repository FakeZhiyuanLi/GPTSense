       Big Orange Bike  Got my ass up!  Got it on the Big Orange Bike!  Biked from the  urlLink Intrepid  all the way down to the  urlLink Museum of Jewish Heritage  and back.  It was glorious!!  I biked past people I knew and people I wish I knew, past tourists going the wrong way on the bike path and even past the Magickal Colorist (although we didn't try to reconnect...guess we've learned that lesson).  I forgot how much that ride opens up my senses.  Feeling the wind, watching the river...it makes all the hideousness better for the moment.  Pluth's back in town.  We grabbed a quick  urlLink lunch .  Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet man.  Lucky to have that friendship.  The Evil Empire is as dull as usual, but it's all okay 'cause the Big Orange Bike made it okay.  And while it's quiet I can do my blogging and my  urlLink blog   urlLink stalking .  On my ride this morning, I actually thought I'd spotted one of my  urlLink blog stalkees ...what would I have done had it actually been he?  Say hi?  Bike past again to see if I got cruised?  God, that's just creepy.  Although more of a possibility than me actually saying hi, I'd guess.  I'm not even sure of the ethics of IMing Those  urlLink Bloggers  Who Intruigue:  Am I bugging them?  How do I even approach that without foisting upon them perhaps unwanted Blog Celeb Status?  And when will I figure out Blogger enough, and have the balls, to link other Blogizens?  That would be SO  urlLink grown up ...  The SF Potential BF is coming into town this weekend...not even sure I think it's a good idea for us to meet face to face, but with all of our mutual friends, I suppose we shall.  Why do the cute, smart ones always live on the other side of the country in a semi-fog of Californian aloofness?

       Celibate! Celibate! (Don't) Dance To The Music  This celibacy thing is... interesting .  On my way home from taking the Dog to the Park (where he positively frollicked...jeez, I  love  that Dog), I decided to make Saturday night Fat Bitch Night.  That's right, substituting sex and drugs with food...what am I gonna do instead, smoke?  So we stopped and got two, count 'em, two pints of Ben & Jerry's (Monkey Wrench and Everything But The, since you asked), got home and ordered the entire Domino's menu (well, okay, maybe only two medium pizzas, Cheesy Bread(TM), and CinniStix(TM)).  While I was waiting I finished the fried wonton from Friday night.  But at least I didn't end up online/at a bar/at the West Side Club, right?  Watched bad tv, until I found "The Spanish Prisoner" on Bravo which was fascinating all over again.  Of course, I forgot that I shouldn't watch television or movies that might even  remotely  feature someone I've worked with whose career I perceive to be better than mine because they're in the thing I'm watching.  It really made me think about moving again.  If I moved to Chicago for awhile, got back to basics, did some edgy theatre, then moved back and resubmerged myself, would I be perceived differently?  Could I get some perspective on what I'm selling?  Or would I just be running away?  God knows I'm a long way from playing that cop on my former brother-in-law's tv show...but...what does that leave me with?  I mostly slept today, except for an awkward and ill-advised reunion in the Park with the Math Genius (who was disturbingly bloated, but  still  adorable...and,  yes , Allen, still straight).  I thought I would finish the pizza and ice cream and watch Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer be old and doddering, but instead felt guilty about not spending time with JJ and so went to the movies with him after the show.  Bridget Jones' Diary (of course fat girls love it, she ends up with a man -- trust me it ain't real).  Just before the movie and for an hour after, JJ decided to start on my life again.  I made the mistake of telling him I wish I could just hit the reset button on my life, that I just didn't know what I was getting out of bed for anymore.  He really thinks I've given up unnecessarily...  He's convinced that making one change, like moving to a new apartment, would change every other aspect of my life.  I remain unconvinced and actually got (briefly) very, very angry with him.  I can't remember the last time I raised my voice on Eighth Avenue.  I know he cares, and I know he doesn't want me to go away, but I don't think he gets just how  exhausted  I am from the constant battle.  We went to the Renaissance to talk a little more, and I think we both calmed down, but we changed the subject.  My goal for tomorrow?  Wake up before noon.  Maybe ride my orange bike.  Try not to eat anything either Ben or Jerry might've thought up.  Wouldn’t it just be easier to do a bump and get laid?

       Chapter One:  I Am Blogged.  Get me, all Dickensian.  Must be a theme this weekend.  And it just took a nudge from the Ghost of Bloggers Present ( urlLink thanks , SK).  Now I can work out my  urlLink Hard Times  with a presumed audience.  Woo hoo!  'Cause, when you think about it, private humiliation is for sissies... Where will it all  urlLink end ?  Who can say?  Indeed, who  will ?

       Internal Inventory  I don't really know what to tell you.  I spent the evening last night trying to write letters to sort everything out should anything need to be sorted.  Loose ends need to be tied up as much as possible so that those less capable (read, everyone else) won't bungle it.  Also trying to think of painless ways to do painful things with a minimum of cleanup after.  This is probably why more Virgos don't actually kill themselves.  I have a huge collection of things that I love that will mean almost nothing to anyone else, and yet I care where they end up.  Who even remembers "My One & Only," much less cares that I saw it about six times and own the propeller that Tommy Tune carried around in it?  Or Sarah Brightman's double mask from "Phantom?"  Sheryl Lee Ralph's shoes from "Dreamgirls" might be an easier sell, but probably not B.D. Wong's shoes from "M. Butterfly".  What about the model for the set of Cinderella's house from "Into The Woods," the mining pick from "Crazy For You" signed by the entire original cast, my letter from Sondheim, my letter from Katharine Hepburn?  My collected works of the Algonquin Round Table...most of them first editions, many signed.  That Woollcott biography of Mrs. Fiske is damn rare, and how'm I gonna explain that the Jack Baragwanath (who was Neysa's husband) memoir is personally autographed to Robert Sherwood's wife...ugh.  The disposition of this junk is keeping me from swallowing a handful of...of... what?   ...well, that's a whole 'nother issue.  I refuse to jump from something.  I'm not slitting anything.  I don't own a gun, nor do I know anyone who does.  Oh wait, I do, but I'm not talking to him.  Partly 'cause he owns a gun.  As evidenced by the inventory taken of my medicine cabinet, I haven't got a handful of anything that would induce the Sleep of Ages.  I had two aunts that killed themselves.  One, who had Parkinson's and could barely hold a soupspoon, shot herself.  She didn't have to, but she thought she did.  The other was 98 years old and always said that when she got tired of it all, she'd walk all the way to the end of the pier behind her house and jump in the river.  That's where they found her.  Can't really blame either of them.  But, as I said, the gun thing horrifies me and, while drowning seems somehow more palatable, the East River's filthy and out of the question and the Hudson doesn't look like it would do the job.  I mean, I  can  swim.  So what does it mean?  Does it mean I don't have the courage of my convictions?  Possibly.  Does it mean that I'm a big pussy?  Sure, okay.  Does it mean that I want to live.  I don't know.  No.  Yes.  I don't know.  I had a few dreams last night, as you might imagine.  The one I remember the most took place in my apartment.  It didn't look like the apartment I live in now, but it was meant to be in the dream.  I've dreamt of living in that apartment before and always before there were rooms and areas within the apartment that I'd never come across before that dream.  This was no different.  In this dream I first noticed that my apartment was empty.  Then I noticed that the service entrance (which actually looked like the service entrance in my real apartment) was open and some of my belongings were stacked there.  I panicked and went back inside to see what was missing...nothing seemed to be.  I then wandered into the back service hallway and saw through a hallway that doesn't really exist, some neighbors I'd never seen before.  One looked cute and was wearing briefs.  I thought I'd get a better look if I went to the window in the back bedroom.  I walked through the apartment to a room I had forgotten even existed.  It wasn't really big enough to be a bedroom, but it was slightly elevated and had windows all the way across the back wall.  Then I realized that they weren't just windows, but sliding doors.  How had I never noticed that?  I stepped up into that room, slid the door open and stepped onto a small terrace I also hadn't known was there.  The sun hit this terrace through some trees and it was so warming and pleasant that I stood there for a few minutes soaking up the heat.  Then I looked around.  Apparently in all the time I'd forgotten to check this back room, they'd built a pool.  Full-size, in-ground pool.  And all the apartments on my floor opened onto this pool area, which was white stucco, with pale brick accents.  And flooded with light.  The neighbor I had seen before was swimming in it, and others were gardening on their terraces, etc.  I thought to myself, "I can't believe I'm leaving here now that there's this beautiful warm terrace and a pool to enjoy, especially just as summer's starting."  I also remember wondering how long it had been there, and that I could've been enjoying it all this time.  None of my neighbors seemed surprised to see me, although I didn't recognize any of them.  I remember starting down the stairs from my terrace towards the pool to check the water, and then I don't remember anything else.  Closer to dawn, I remember being half awake while this rapid-fire slide show went off in my head.  So fast that not a single image remains.  It was disorienting in it's speed and also in the fact that each image contained some full emotion that hit me fully but moved on with the next image/feeling.  I don't remember any of it specifically, just that it happened.  I couldn't get my ass out of bed this morning.  My angelic puffin (who's real name is Dexter and who said to me in a dream several nights ago that he didn't like the pseudonym "Rex" because it made him sound common and he didn't need his anonymity protected) stood worried guard over me until I managed to sit up.  We took a short walk, I made us breakfast, I packed some books, I sat on the sofa and cried.  Finally, I made the call I'd been dreading.  I called the landlord to tell him that, even though I'd promised to get him this money by the end of the month, I just didn't have it.  I said I could send him a check for $800 and I'd work on getting him the rest as soon as I could, but I honestly didn't know when or how fast that would be.  Do you know what he said to me?  He said, "You've sent in money when you told me you would, and I consider you a man of your word.  So I'll work with you on this."  A man of my word.  Me?  I don't know what to do with this information.  And this from a man who very recently made me feel that my absence would be worth far more than my presence.  Is he fucking with me?  I got email today from a bunch of people, many of them bloggers, almost all of them people I've never met.  They all said different-but-similar things: that I had value.  These are all people I consider to be interesting, accomplished, intelligent...at least in their writing and in the information they've chosen to put out into the world.  Man, I thought to myself, I've pulled some major wool over an internet full of eyes.  I have value?  I don't know what to do with that information, either.  Jesus H., I just got off the phone.  It was JSquared.  Through him, the Universe has decided to pluck me up by the scruff of my neck and toss me into the second weirdest place I could be this weekend:  "I have an extra ticket to the Tonys and the Rocky Horror Tony party after."  What.  The.  Fuck?  Now "Happy Couple Party" doesn't sound so bad.  Nooooo, now my option is put on a fake Prada suit that I'll feel fat in and enter the belly of the Showtune Singin' Beast.  I really don't know what to do with this information.  It's not like anyone's gonna say "what the hell are you doing here?"  I actually think people assume I go to these things all the time.  But what if they ask "what are you in now?"  Or even, "how are you?"  I'm petrified of these questions.  Last night I thought I was done.  This morning, too.  I still thought so at the beginning of this entry.  But it looks like, for the moment at least, I have to throw in the towel on throwing in the towel.  I really don't understand it.  I wish I had some sort of perspective or could just get a peek at the schematic.  Something, anything...'cause I just don't understand it.  It's easy to say, "let go and see where the current takes you," but it's not such an easy thing to do.  It's not something that makes sense to me.  Faith?  As if.  But given the fact that, strong desire aside, I seem ill-prepared to jump ship at the moment, and the fact that I'm being tossed all manner of weird life preservers, I suppose I might as well just "ride it out, girlfriend."  Y'know, I was telling RJ the other night that, no matter how bad the movie or play or book, I always stick it out to the end.  Don't know why.  Maybe it's stubbornness or strong curiosity...and sometimes it's been rewarded.  I guess I should afford my so-called life the same courtesy.

       Lousy Act III Curtain  In all probability, I won't last the weekend.  There's just too much that I can't cope with.  By the end of this week I'm supposed to hand over to my landlord about $2,800.  I'll probably have $800.  The stuff I tried to sell to get the money just didn't sell and I've got nowhere to find it.  Although I've tried to pack up my apartment in preparation, there's too much to go through and nowhere to put it.  Sure, I'll have to go back to court, and the marshalls won't come to toss my belongings onto the street for another week or so, but why prolong it?  I'm tired and I'm sad I'm incredibly overwhelmed.  On Saturday, the man that I thought I would spend the rest of my life with will be marrying a fat and not particularly charming opera singer.  We were together for five years and when we met I had no idea that colors were so bright, that food tasted so good, that one man's voice could infuse me with energy and laughter.  It's not that I want him back...I honestly don't.  But I don't want to be alone anymore.  And I don't really see an option.  I'm too everything: cranky, fat, annoyed, annoying, smart, right, complicated, broke, tired, sad, overwhelmed.  I couldn't invite anyone into this mess.  They wanted me to attend.  He doesn't get why I can't.  On Sunday, I'm supposed to attend a Tony party.  Probably three couples and me.  Three sets of homeowners and me.  Three sets of professionals and me.  To do what?  To watch friends, acquaintances, former friends, former tricks, friends of friends, business associates, and some minor heroes take part in, and some even win, one of the highest honors bestowed by and on my beloved Theatre.  In so many ways, I'll feel like one of those little urchins in "Oliver!" or "Annie" with my nose pressed to a window watching sumptuous couples partake of a sumptuous banquet, to which I'm not invited.  So I wanna hit the reset button.  Will I?  God, I actually hope so.  How?  Still thinking about it.  I'm a pussy, so hopefully I'll be able to clean out somebody's medicine cabinet or something and fall into a long and lovely sleep.  I'm just so tired of fighting and I'm tired of doing it alone.  It's really that simple.  I don't feel sorry for myself, or particularly scared anymore.  Just defeated.  And one thing I've always given myself credit for is knowing when to leave a party before I grow too tiresome.

       Nothing  Today I did nothing.  Unscheduled, yet unrepentant, nothing.  I don't think people outside of Manhattan realize what pressure and anxiety doing nothing causes us.  How can we sit idly inside our apartments when just on the other side of the door there's all that stuff to do.  Exhibits (Vermeer, Gehry, Jackie O's yard sale) and gallery openings (exploding planes in oil on canvas), new Ethiopian tapas places, street fairs, other people's bad cabaret shows, other people's bad Off-Off-Broadway shows, your  own  bad Off-Off-Broadway show...there's a lot to be done.  Not to mention the stuff that needs to be done indoors:  clean the bathroom, iron, wipe that black stuff off the shelves on the inside of the refrigerator door, finally sort the shopping bag of unmarked cassettes.  But me?  I did nothing.  At first, I did nothing inside.  I answered email, I did my online reading, I blogged (therefore I am).  I even blogged for  urlLink someone else .  I watched something called  urlLink Say What? Karaoke , which is apparentely a bunch of talent-free kids, lipsynching to some talent-free songs by other more-famous-but-equally-talent-free kids.  It was delightful in a vulgar sorta way.    But just as I had found the perfect position on the sofa where I could balance the remote, the dog, and a full glass of ice cold Diet Coke, something happened outside.  The rain of the past few days suddenly stopped and this eerie yellowish light came pouring through the windows.  I remember we once called it " sunshine ."  I thought to myself: perhaps I can collect my young ward and continue my nothingness in the out of doors.  We meandered through the throngs of tourists who had the poor judgement not to spend Memorial Day in their own hometowns, and the sailors and marines still lingering from Fleet Week (I'm disturbed to learn that our nation's defense in the hands of Schlitz-guzzling, Skoal-spitting trailer trash), and ended up under a tree in Central Park.  Rex was overjoyed.  The WunderHund rolled and sniffed and sneezed and grinned so much that it took everything I had not to just eat him up.  He actually  frolicked .  I stretched out, closed my eyes, and listened to the sounds of a Sunday afternoon on the Isle Manhattan: a sweet, fuzzy bumblebee, the clopping of the carriage horses, in the distance the calliope of the carousel, even further in the distance, the blast of a cruise ship sailing from the West 50s, the jabbering of Korean tourists (such a  pretty  language), Rex munching loudly on a twig.  The sun was warming, but not hot; the grass was cool but not wet; I was happy but not at my ideal weight.  We sat under the tree for about an hour.  Doing nothing.  Today I learned I'm good at doing nothing.  And, what's more, I  enjoy  it.

       Putting Out  I started this blog (hard to believe that's a grown-up word) for a bunch of reasons.  Through a series of links I'd come across  urlLink Jonno's blog .  I was fascinated, not just by the writing and his breezy, intelligent style, but by the form itself.  Part confessional, part thoughtful commentary, part advent calendar (y'know, those calendars where behind each little window is a surprise: a piece of chocolate, or a story...that's how I see hyperlinks).  Through links on his page, I found even more blogs/diaries/journals -- interesting lives interestingly told -- and I was addicted.  I knew that, with all the turmoil that was in my life, I needed to journal, but the Morning Pages proscribed by  urlLink The Artist's Way  wasn't doing it for me.  I figured this blog thingy might be a good exercise.  For the past month, I've been writing faithfully.  It's been an incredible tool and I really look forward to it.  Sometimes I think about what I want to write about and sometimes I have no idea until I start writing. Either way, I feel somehow better when I'm done.  More than once I've found myself crying as I finish.  Whatever it is I'm getting out of me, it's making room for other things...some incredibly welcome, some uncomfortable.  Some just plain weird.  At the same time, I get feedback from people I don't know.  They're having similar experiences.  They don't know me, but they encourage me.  It's almost like being onstage.    I've made some friendships through this writing.  I've begun a correspondence with several other bloggers/diarists, people I wouldn't have ever come across any other way.  One who, in a short time, has entrusted me to be his blog understudy while he's on vacation.  Another who, different as our lives are, were we to live in the same city, I'm sure we'd be good pals.  Who knows, we might be anyway.  I've met two fellow-travellers who live in my neighborhood and I hope they'll be friends as well, 'cause they're bright and fun and we share this blog strangeness (I've learned you can't explain the blog phenomena to civilians).  I've even had a date with someone I met through this medium.  I don't think either of us are under the illusion that it's to become anything romantic, but I think we're both enjoying the presence of the other in our lives and hopefully we'll build on that in some fashion.  At least that's what I very much hope for.  I've also, apparently, made some enemies.  Not anyone who's met me or emailed me or responded to me in anyway, just people who felt they needed to be hurtful in their journals.  Okey dokey, then.  Two of them in particular bemoan their singleness.  Here's a hint (learned from much experience):  anger and fear aren't the aphrodisiacs they might seem to be.  'Nuff said.  Here's another weird thing: writing about something or someone has, in several instances, manifested that person or thing.  There's all kinds of synchonistic occurrences floating around and through my life.  It's a little bit ooky, it's a little bit fun.  As Honey Dijon, dj and drag diva extraordinaire once said to me during what must've looked like a particularly vivid ecstacy moment, "ride it out, girlfriend."  What's the point?  I'm sure I had one...oh wait, here it is (the puppy was chewing on it).  The point is, none of it --the good, the bad, the ugly, the strange, the comfortable and the un- -- none of it would have come to me if I hadn't put myself out there.  I guess I've been feeling a little battered, in general by the swirling strangeness that's entered through whatever portal my blog has created, but especially by an instance of perceived nastiness.  I think this is the point in my life where, historically, the discomfort makes me stop or shut down.  Well, I don't want to, I'm gonna keep putting my thoughts and energy and goofiness out there.  Not for you, whoever you are, but for me.  But then, everybody likes a boy that puts out, right?

       Keep Passing The Open Windows   urlLink This article  about Susannah McCorkle scares the hell outta me.  I guess because I understand too well the feeling of being so ready to give what you have as an artist with no outlet for it and the resulting desperation.  I envy writers and painters the fact that they can craft their art alone.  Sure, they eventually need to take their art to the world, but a performing artist needs an audience first and foremost -- there isn't any point to his art without it.  I can't sit at home and act up a storm, put it in a jar, and go try to sell it later; what I do is crafted for an audience, with an audience; it changes and is elevated by it, and sometimes dies with it.  Wanna know a secret that probably isn't a secret?  Everything that's wrong with my life could be put right with one good project.  If I had a good, solid place to channel my creative energy, to feel useful and respected, to play and work at something I truly love, well...all the rest of it would fall into place or, at the very least, into perspective.  Being an actor isn't just a hobby or something I do for attention or because it's easier or more glamorous than having a "real" job.  If I could've been happy being anything else, trust me, I'd have done it.  But this is what I am; it's what I'm best at.  Coming offstage after you've nailed a scene is the most amazing high there is.  No, wait, there might be one better:  running across a stranger on the street or in a store who comes up to you a little shyly, tells you they saw your show last week, and then tells you, in detail, about the thing you did that made them laugh so much.  And then  they  thank  you .  Imagine: I did something good.  Why shouldn't that make everything right?  And why shouldn't the absence of that make me sad and angry and a little crazy?  My cabaret and recording careers are nowhere near as impressive as Susannah's.  I've never played the Oak Room (more like Don't Tell Mama).  Still I feel the same anguish about having no outlet for my art.  I don't wanna be famous, I don't have that need.  I want to work and to put my perspective out there through my medium.  I know what I've got to give is complicated and challenging, sometimes a little dark and damned quirky, but doesn't it deserve as much of a hearing as, say, "Oops I Did It Again?" or "Joe Dirt?"    Unlike Susannah, I've managed to "keep passing the open windows."  But for how much longer?

       Foul Weather Friend  Still rainy, still feeling crummy.  Wanted to sleep today, but got up and made some phone calls, tried to push my life forward a couple of steps.  Got a call from my friend JP.   "Let's have coffee."   Yeah, okay, coffee couldn't hurt.  He shows up at my apartment a couple of hours later,  "let's get coffee in Chelsea."   Umm, well, I guess we might as well.  We hop down on the E train, laughing and bantering.   "Let's go to the Big Cup."   I'm a little old for it, but okay.   "Let's have Rice Krispies Treats."   Too many carbs, but JP talks me into it.  Half way through coffee and cruising and feeling goofy in a good way, JP suggests  "let's go to a movie."   I don't really feel like it, I have a whole big life to mismanage, it's the middle of the day, I've got packing to do...but he talks me into going to a matinee of "Shrek" which he pays for.  We walk into the theater and there are only two other guys in there.  Without even looking at each other, we walk straight over to the two seats in front of them and plop ourselves down.  After a second or two, they laugh, we laugh and move out of their way.  The movie's actually a lot of fun.   "Let's go to happy hour."   I can't.  I have to walk the puppy, makes some calls...but if I change my mind I'll meet him in front of the gym in an hour.  An hour later the phone rings,  "get dressed bitch, we need alcohol."   We go to Barrage for a couple of drinks (which he pays for), mock the beautiful yet very, very young waiter, chat with friends, goof off, talk seriously about nothing and about nothing serious.   "We're hungry."   Actually, I kinda am.  We go to Vinyl, I have a comfy chicken pot pie.  He walks me home and I hug him goodbye.  I didn't get a damn thing done.  I'm not any further ahead or any closer to rent.  But I didn't dwell on it for a whole day...in fact, I laughed a lot.  I spent all day with someone who loves me exactly the way I am, is concerned about my troubles but knew I needed a vacation from them and didn't mention it, just coaxed me into a little relaxation and mindless activity.  Sometimes my friends are smarter than I am.

       The Vicious Circle  It's been raining all day.  The light in my apartment is the color of a bruise and that's the color I feel today, too.  There's a narcotic fog seeping into my head caused, not by something externally ingested, but by the toxic fumes of despair and anger.  I move around my apartment and pick up objects I know are mine, put on clothes I know belong to me, but  nothing  feels right.  And yet, I have to leave the house and pretend everything's fine (if for no one else, well then, for me).  There's just enough rain to need an umbrella and to cause confusion, the pedestrian pedestrians navigating umbrellas with no thought of the humanity below it.  I'm just as bad.  I usually walk quickly, my natural pace is fast and my legs are long, but I don't have the energy to pour it on today, and so the peripheral blur comes into slightly more focus.  I turn onto 44th Street and up ahead is the  urlLink Algonquin .  As always, I imagine myself back in time.  But instead of the 1920s, where my mind usually takes me on this street, I go back to 1983.  Before I moved to New York City, among my many oddities was a passion for the  urlLink Algonquin Round Table .  I don't remember how I found them, but more and more I wanted to lunch with them.   urlLink Dorothy Parker ,  urlLink George S. Kauffman ,  urlLink Alexander Woollcott , H urlLink  arold Ross,  urlLink Edna Ferber ,  urlLink Noel Coward , et. al.  I was a smart kid with a quick mind and a sharp tongue and I learned a lot from reading these heroes of mine.  I loved the word games ("Dorothy, use the word 'horticulture' in a sentence"), the comraderie, the insults ("Why Edna, in that suit you look almost like a man." "Why Noel, in that suit, so do you.").  I learned I had the talent to lacerate with my tongue and even have my victim chuckle along until he discovered he was bleeding.  I imagined moving to New York and finding a coterie of intelligent, talented friends who supported each other, complemented each other, fought and famously made up with each other.  It would make us all better and smarter and funnier and more successful and, finally, accepted.  It didn't happen exactly that way.  But imagine me in 1983, walking alone in a City where I had never been before and knew no one, with less than $200 to my name, optimistic but a little anxious, wondering if this move was right, then turning a corner and seeing the Hotel Algonquin.  I'd found a physical portal where met my fantasy, my hero worship and my new reality.  Of course, I was 20 years old and shabbily dressed, clearly I didn't belong in the lobby of the Algonquin, but with the chutzpah that a 20-year-old, freshly-minted New Yorker can muster, I pushed through the revolving door.  The lobby had changed very little from the time of  urlLink Hecht  and  urlLink MacArthur  and  urlLink Neysa McMein  and I knew it all in my mind's eye before I'd stepped foot in.  A long front desk, the tiny Blue Bar, the newsstand, the two dining rooms (the Oak Room and the Rose Room), all of it with heavy, Edwardian wainscotting.  Around the lobby are arranged comfortable leather and fabric chairs in warm, dark tones with small tables, each with a bell.  One can sit, discreetly touch the bell, and order a cocktail or tea, and read, or watch the crowd.  At least one celebrity interview or major business deal is done in these chairs every day.  I couldn't afford to sit.  If I sat, dressed as I was, and didn't order, I knew I'd be sussed out as not belonging, and I needed to stay and breathe that air a little longer.  Then I saw the phone booth.  I honestly couldn't say if that phone booth had been there from the beginning, but it sure looked like it.  Oak paneled, with an elegant bench and small table next to the payphone, with a beveled-glass door that closed (when's the last time you sat down in a phone booth and closed the door?).  Frankly, I couldn't afford a phone call either...I'd need that change later, for my generic iced tea and generic pasta with generic sauce that I'd be making on my hot plate in my residence hotel (bathroom down the hall).  But I could sit, gather my thoughts, and take in the place that epitomized my New York.  I preteneded to make a couple of calls, but mostly what I did was scan the room from my secret vantange point.   The New Yorker  became a real magazine here.  In this lobby, the germ for plays were discussed and begun, plays which shaped 20th Century American humor.  The wisecrack was more or less born here.  I didn't fall through a time portal and wake up in 1923, ready to have a drink with  urlLink Benchley  before luncheon, but while I sat there, something did happen: I breathed; the anxiety dissipated.  In a little while, I felt calm and ready to step back outside and battle the Big Apple.  I returned to the Algonquin a lot that first year.  I still couldn't afford lunch, or even tea, but I'd make my calls and loiter a bit at the newsstand, always leaving with a refreshed outlook.  Eighteen years later, and I'm walking the same streets, though much has changed.  These days I don't worry so much about how I look walking into someplace; I wear my New Yorkness like a finely-tailored Armani suit and I manage to exude something resembling confidence and strength even when (especially when) that's not what's roiling in my gut.  I'm still broke, but I can afford a smart cocktail.  And while I make mental inventories of the treasures I can sell to get myself out of my current mess, it would never occur to me that I sell a single book or letter from my treasured collection of Round Table first editions, signed limited editions, letters, documents.  They still hold more than magic for me, they represent what I still might achieve.  I'm running late.  The rain is making me later.  I've got to go pay just enough of my Con Ed bill to keep my electricity from being turned off then hurry to a temp job I hate.  I speed past the Algonquin, past the  urlLink Royalton  (Benchley: "I must speak with that inconsiderate manager of the Royalton.  He keeps closing the 43rd Street doors during luncheon and I can't cut through their lobby to get to the Algonquin.") and I turn on my heels and head back to the Algonq.  Through those same doors.  The phone booth's been gone for years and the Blue Bar has moved to a reclaimed section of the Oak Room.  But the ghosts of my heroes still knock back the gin and sling out the barbs.  A breath; two.  Some things haven't changed:  I don't feel any less bruised, but I can make it here another day.

       A Fair Is A Veritable Smorgasbord (Orgasbord)!  Today was the first day of the Ninth Avenue Food Festival, the closest thing Manhattan has to a county fair.  All up and down Ninth Avenue, from 57th Street to about 38th Street, are kiosks and tables and makeshift counters serving all sorts of food, drink, magnets, scissors, tshirts, sarongs, toys, veg-o-matics, bonsai, sheets and on and on.  It's a wonderland!  Even though I generally allow myself only one Fat Bitch Day a week (the day when I can eat anything regardless of it's caloric ability to make me a less salable product), the Food Festival demands that I extend it to two glorious, salt-bloated, funnelcake-stuffed, Pepcid-filled days.  Today's tally: meat-filled Bruno's ravioli, a corndog, caramel turtle cheesecake, fried calamari ( urlLink you know  it's squidlicious!), and a mini key lime pie, washed down with fresh squeezed lemonade.  Rex's tally:  half a cheese-filled ravioli from the ground in front of Bruno's, some grilled onions from the front of the corndog stand, a fried scallop from the front of the calamari stand, and some ice from my lemonade.  Tomorrow?  I've got my eye on a bloomin' onion and there's some sour cream apple walnut pie with my name on it...  The other fun thing about the Food Fest is, like a county fair, I run into a lot of people I know, most of whom I haven't seen since last year's grazing down Ninth Avenue.  Some I've  urlLink never seen before  (no, I didn't say hi...).  I got flirted with today more than I have in the last month and it was a nice ego booster.  What's better than the smell of roasting corn and pork and someone's hands on your chest telling his equally cute friend, "I have such a crush on this man."  Oh yeah, they serve alcohol at this thing, too.  I got some decent proposals (an invitation to a birthday party tonight) and some indecent ones ("my boyfriend's working until seven...want to come up for some, umm, lemonade?").  Saw a lot of people between shows and between jobs and between boyfriends.  It was swell.  Really, the only bad thing is that Rex has a little fear of smoke.  It's kind of a primal thing, I guess, since I've had him since he was three months old and never chased him with fire.  I tried to get used to it today, and he did okay.  The bits of dropped gyro didn't hurt.  My little angel had a pretty good time, though, and I think he's finally getting the idea that daddy doesn't need a chick magnet...the freeze-dried liver flows when the puppy pulls in the boys.  I wanted to buy him a dolphin balloon to tie to his collar, but I thought it was a little too "Courtship of Eddie's Father."  Also, he's a dog.  He and I just got up from a nap.  I've never had a dog that loved to spoon so much.  It was delicious.  I think I'm gonna pop down to that birthday party and wreak a little havoc.  But not too late...my fuzzy little boyfriend and I have a date in front of the air conditioner tonight...

       Sure, But Can He Catch?   urlLink This letter  fascinates me.  Does anybody else smell  urlLink Brady Anderson ?  I'm torn on this one.  I know he's an athlete, with a great deal of societal and professional pressures.  I realize that he's faced with the prospect of being denied the pleasure of doing that which he loves and at which he excels (not to mention the loss of a lot of money) and that's real-world scary.  But it's the 21st Century, we're supposed to be " urlLink post-gay " aren't we?  And he's certainly not the first athlete to come out.  Yeah, it's a testosterone driven world...so's  urlLink Chelsea .  Will he get fired?  Doubt it.  Will he lose fans?  Doubt it.  Will he get shot by some bubba who has questions about his own sexuality.  Okay, there you've got me.  I haven't been in the closet since 1978 (and over 1 billion served since), so I can't even imagine how hard it must be.  But it can't be harder than being a skinny kid in Tampa, Florida where every truck in the high school parking lot had a gun rack and where "faggot" was a morning greeting, can it?  I guess I do have a problem with people in an intense public spotlight, with nothing to lose, who won't come out.  Really,  urlLink Rosie ...you can devote so much of your time to helping kids, make such a fuss about how you wanted to fit in as a kid, and not want to help the baby dykes in the midwest contemplating suicide?  For crissakes, you discuss your infections and bowel movements on the air, but not who you love?  There's a disconnect there, somewhere.  By trying not to make it an issue, it becomes an even bigger issue.  I've always known I was gay.  Didn't always have a word for it, but don't you worry, the other kids handed me that vocabulary right quick.  I grew up in the South (first person who tries to tell me Tampa, Florida in the '60s and '70s wasn't the South gets an ass full of grits-flavored boot, size 11) and, if there's one thing those ol' rednecks (fathers included) couldn't stand is a sensitive, well-read, pale, non-sports playing, Broadway musical lover with a geographically-untraceable accent.  Let me tell ya, you never really get over hearing your father declare to a room of people that his son is "sissified."  I was what I was.  I wasn't particularly brave about it, and I sure as hell wasn't comfortable with it.  Mostly because I was the only one in the world.  I dated a boy in high school that, in retrospect, was probably the love of my life.  I lost him because while I knew what I was, we were the only two in the world and it was just too hard (sorry Mac, hope it's better on the other side).  There was nobody to help me to make it okay to be the thing I was.  What would have made it okay?  Maybe someone famous, someone irrefutably successful, someone strong that the world acknowledged was strong, to say "Hey, I'm one, too."  I'd still probably have had the name-calling, and the threats, and the discomfort.  But I wouldn't have been the only one anymore.  Gee, I guess I'm not so torn on this after all.  C'mon out, Baseball Hero...somebody needs you...

       Bipolar Expedition  Do you ever feel like maybe you're the most beautiful person in the world, only no one's told you?  I do, sometimes.  Until someone tells me I am, and then that person becomes suspect because, of course, I'm ugly and fat.  I can see that in the mirror.  Do you ever feel so talented at whatever it is you do that you have to giggle at the cleverness of you?  Well, I do.  And then it occurs to me that, if that were really so, wouldn't someone or something have come along already and elevated me to a status befitting such grand talent?  How 'bout feeling smart as hell, pleased with making sense of the world and negotiating it's treacheries, proud to command such a personal perspective and the ability to express it so fully?  Happens to me every day.  Then I read someone else's random scribblings, or comment thoughtfully on someone's blog, and I realize,  who the hell am I ?  A once-smart kid who grew up with increasingly less stimulation, who bungled his higher education, and now wants to retain that smart kid status...I'm fooling no one but myself.  The worst part is, all of those thoughts/feelings exist inside of me at the same time.  They take up the same space in my head and heart.  Not equal space, mind you, the  exact same space .  What is illuminated is also, at the same time, dark and shadowy.  What is absolute is absolutely uncertain.  They live on top of each other inside me, like a multi-tiered game of chess played on one level.  Clearly, I'm not stable.  Sometimes --  a lot of times  -- this causes me to become paralyzed with objectivity.  I won't argue my case because, frankly, I agree with the other person just as strongly.  I'm willing to believe the absolute worst about myself even though I also  don't  believe it.  You like me?  Wow, that's cool that you see what's unique in me (finally!)...but I can't let you in 'cause I'm a terrible person.  And it's not a case of the "God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me-Oh-You-Do-I'll-See-You-Later Blues," I think it's more complicated than that.  Multiple personalities?  Nah, that would actually make me interesting.  I think it has to be some sort of fear.  Isn't it always?  But what am I afraid of?  That my life's not gonna be what I want it to be?  Umm... ring, ring ...it's the Cluephone...  Is it some personal preemptive strike against fate?  Could be.  I know I haven't always felt this way.  I guess it crept in through the cracks of run-of-the-mill disappoints that became somehow exaggerated.  Should I have expected less?  Should I now?  Both of those voices, both internal opinions, have equal weight right now, but only one gets any real exercise.  If I were counselling a friend, I'd tell him to act as if the good stuff were true; to go through those physical motions even if they felt false, until it started to feel true.  I tell myself that, and it sounds like Louise Hay Lite ( All the Personal Growth and None of the Pain...now in new Wild Berry flavor! ).  I don't know how or where to start and I've lost the ability to act on the positive feelings about myself that really do exist...and quite strongly.    Even if I did, somebody'd find me out.

       What's My Motivation?  I woke up.  I took the puppy around the block.  I made eggs and grits. I didn't watch The View.  I tried to go for a ride, but it's way too windy by the Hudson and feels like rain.  I paid Verizon.  I went to the gym and squatted a pathetic 180 lbs.  I did not get cruised in the steam room.  I juiced about 50 carrots and a dozen apples which yielded about 6 ounces of juice.  I drank the juice.  I like-a the juice.  The juice is goood.  I napped.  I packed up some scripts and junk.  I folded some shirts.  I read some blogs.  I sent some email.  I finally wrote up some descriptions for the auction of the costumes (anyone interested in original cast finale costumes from "A Chorus Line?"   No?  Judy Kaye's "Veronique" costume from "On the 20th Century?"  Ya sure?).  Walked the puppy again.  Picked up some grilled chicken and headed to the Temp Mines.  I did stuff, but not enough.  And, mostly, not meaningful stuff.  I don't feel any further ahead than I did yesterday.  I helped no one.  It's Wednesday already.    Is this how everyone's life goes?  Am I just tossing mine away?  Can the inert actually toss?

       Model Behavior  Overheard this afternoon in the locker room of Prescriptive Fitness, NYC:   Model 1:  Hey, I thought you lived in L.A. Model 2:  I totally do!  I thought  you  lived in L.A. Model 1:  Totally!  But I've got a place here, too. Model 2:  I totally do, too.  Now all we need's a place in Paris. Model 1:  Right?  Except I  hate  being there for work. Model 2:  Oh, totally! [At this point, I'm thinking: if you call walking a flat platform to the end, turn around without falling, and walking back  work , then, yeah, I can see why you'd hate it.]  Model 2:  How's your place here? Model 1:  Totally small compared to what I have on the Coast. Model 2:  Yeah, same here, totally.  My friends can't believe what I pay. Model 1:  Oh god,  totally .  But convenient.  Wake up and everything's right there. [Me:  Yeah, right next to the thesaurus.]  Model 2:  Well, I've got a go-see, later dude. Model 1:  Later.  Now, of course, besides feeling fat and ugly, I really hate them both on principal (if we can't hate the beautiful and vapid, who can we hate?).  Until Model 1 cruises me really hard on his way to the showers.  He's tall, dark hair, blue eyes, ripply stomach.  He's so lean and cut, he looks a little like a prawn, but a  sexy  prawn.  Still.  While I'm stewing in self- and other sorts of loathing, Prawn Boy comes back and cruises me again.  Not subtly, but I assume subtlety doesn't figure largely in his life.  Maybe he's just never seen a person with an extra 10 pounds.  I continue dressing and, once more, The Prawn walks slowly by, stares, smiles.  I'm forced to laugh at myself for enjoying a quirky sense of power and, just for a second or two, hating him a little less.  And I think to myself:   Totally!

       A Cry For Help  Dear Oprah:  Please fix my life.  I watch you all the time and you have these incredible  urlLink Lifestyle Makeovers .  People have "Lightbulb Moments."  They lose weight and get new clothes and have terrific relationships.  I'm all for it, really...fix my life?  Now, I know you generally only help overweight, middle-aged women from the square states, but I'm a 38-year-old, queer, out-of-work actor who could stand to lose a good 10 lbs...in Gay Manhattan, it's the same thing.  All the other boys have  urlLink careers ,  and  urlLink shares on the Island , and  urlLink Investment Banker boyfriends , and I don't even own a pair of  urlLink Fluevogs .  I've really tried to change my life by myself, but it's hard.  I tried to follow those  urlLink Nine Steps to Financial Freedom , but there's not a step for "my rent's already two months behind" and it keeps screwing me over.  Maybe the  urlLink Angel Network  could send me enough loose change to catch up and then I could start back with Principle #1.  I've also listened very hard to the things that  urlLink Dr. "Tell It Like It Is" Phil  has said, but even with my Southern upbringing, I don't understand his advice.   Just because there's hickory nuts on the porch don't mean there's a nutcracker in the parlor.   C'mon, you don't get him either, do ya?  Well,  maybe  it's just me...all the housewives in your audience seem to nod and understand him, so I guess I'm just being obtuse.  It's probably just advice for  straight  people.  By the way, Oprah, your hair looks  great ...who does it?    I keep wanting to " urlLink Remember My Spirit " but they stopped letting me at my temp job.  Something about the scented candles being inappropriate.  And lemme tell ya, DO NOT try to remember your spirit before or after an audition...that's a ribbing I don't need again anytime soon.     I finally abandoned my Gratitude Journal when I realized that I what I was increasingly grateful for was my prescription of Valium.  And about the  urlLink Kindness Chain , Oprah?  How often are people supposed to come back for seconds on it without returning any kindness?  This might just be something that works best outside of New York City limits.  Life is hard, Oprah.   I try to say my affirmations and give my spare change to the less fortunate and wear vibrant colors that people don't expect of me, but it doesn't seem to be enough.  I'm sure there's more to it than just New Agey catchphrases and herbal baths, but I'm not getting it on my own.  So here's what I'm proposing:  I know you like us Faerie Folk (did I mention how  fab  your hair looked today?).  It's an untapped market for you, really.  I think I speak for a lot of gay men who need to lose 10 lbs, find boyfriends, fulfilling careers, and kicky Fluevogs when I tell you it would be a whole lot easier for you to speak directly to us than to have us continue to imagine ourselves in the places of those unhappily married, overweight Midwest ladies (who make up the majority of your target audience now) and translate it back to our real lives.  So, what about this:  you fix my life on national tv and I'll deliver a giant market of adoring, disposable-income spending, spirit-remembering queerboys to carry you into your declining years.  Think about what we've done for Garland and Streisand, and they  never  helped us fix our lives.  So I'm ready, Oprah.  I'm available to fly out to Chicago almost anytime (but Tuesdays would be better, 'cause that's the night I'm not temping).  Fix me!  Your Pal, E.B.

       Mommie Vaguest  Mother's Day, huh?  Sorry -- don't get it.  Of course, that might be 'cause I haven't spoken to my mine in a few years.  Mother, that is.  It's not really a big deal, I just finally got up-to-speed on our relationship.  Turns out it's like one of those " urlLink Magic Eye " pictures.  I stared at it and stared at it for years, thinking I knew what it was, other people told me what  they  thought it was, but I  still  didn't see it, then one day it came into focus, I saw exactly what it is and now I can't  not  see it.  She had me when she was 40.  At the time she had a philandering, probably alcoholic husband and nearly-invalid mother to take care of as well.  But, as I so helpfully and appropriately announced at Christmas Eve dinner once, if I'm such a goddamned burden, why didn't she just have an abortion?  It's a good question.  But if she had,  you'd probably be having to play Mah Johngg at  urlLink Iwin  instead of reading this fascinating blog.  At any rate, I think she probably felt incredibly put-upon, with very few options.  I feel for her, but I feel more for the baby, who had fewer options.  She had been a party girl (see I come by it honestly) who's life went horribly traditional at some point.  Sorry, lady.  What's even more fucked up, and I'll have to really look into this sometime, is why  I  chose  her .  The point is, I arrived, they divorced, her mother died, and there we were, just the two of us.  Shoulda brought us closer together, huh?  Let's look and see:  She worked as a secretary, 8 to 5 every day, so as soon as she could go back to work, I went to a sitter all day.  Once I was old enough for pre-school (3 years old), I was there all day with day care until she could pick me up after work.  Then I became a latch key child, coming home to an empty house every day after school until she came home.  And after 5:30 or 6pm when she was home?  Well, we never ate a meal together at the dinner table...ever.  For a long time, most of our meals were delivered by a service she paid for, so she didn't have to cook when she got home.  Fair enough, but I was eating someone else's food at a table for one in front of the television at 8 years old.  No "how was your day" or "what did you learn."  No "who are your friends" or "do you have any homework."  For that matter, no "want me to read you a story?" or "should I lay down with you until you're not afraid anymore?" or "give me a hug."  Especially the last one.  A story I really enjoy telling therapists, is the one where I come into the kitchen (I had to be small because I remember my head not coming quite up to the counter top), running up to my mother who's washing dishes and give her a big hug from behind, to which she says, without even looking down, "not now, honey, it's too hot for that."  Well, it  was  Florida.  Thank Goddess for the Theatre.  And for other people's perceptive mothers.  Oh sure, she did drive me to rehearsals, but that meant also guaranteed I'd be out for awhile.  Other people's mothers noticed me, liked me, acknowledged my intelligence and creativity.  Got me IQ tests.  Got me into Gifted Child Ed. programs.  Had me over for the weekend.  I remember once Mrs. Orlosky, the mother of a couple of friends from theatre --kids, by the way, that I hadn't seen for a couple of years at the time of this incident-- stopped by my house out of the blue with an entire collection of J.D. Salinger paperbacks, just because she thought I needed to read them.  Thanks Mrs. Orlosky, Happy Mothers' Day to you.  I'm not saying my mother's an ogre.  She's probably a really nice person.  She just has no interest in me.  Barely came to see me in shows.  Never told me I was good in 'em or not.  Actually, never mentioned me at all.  I didn't even realized I was missing that, until one summer in stock, years later, I learned my friend David's mother had a sort of shrine to him in her house:  articles, pictures, reviews...the whole thing.  I commented at dinner that night about this goofy shrine and, it turns out, it's what normal, proud parents do.  Normal parents make their kids feel great just for existing; normal parents celebrate the special things their kids do.  Oh.  Wait, I can sorta see those pixels forming...is it a sailboat?  A pony?  A few years I was hired to sing on a cd, my first major recording project, and when it was done I sent my mother a copy.  She confirmed she got it, that's the last I've heard about it.  A year or so after that, I mounted my own, farily successful cabaret show in Manhattan.  Surprisingly, she decided to come up to see it.  This was perfect:   just me singing and goofing off for an hour or so.  I made sure my friend moved her over by the door as soon as the show was over, so she'd not only overhear what other people said about me on their way out, but what they said  to  me.  I was overwhelmed.  Friends, acquaintences, strangers all loved my material, my voice, my energy.  I noticed my mother chatting to someone off to the side...about azaleas.  At dinner after she never mentioned a thing about me or the show.  During the next two days of her visit, while I learned things about her and about my own life that I'd never known (like, for instance, where she and my father met and how long they were really married), she never talked about my show, the alleged reason for her coming up.  On the last night she was in town, I finally, blatantly asked, "so what are you gonna tell everyone at home your favorite show in New York was?"  To which she replied, "The Scarlet Pimpernel?"  "Ummm...no."  "1776?"  "No, mother."  "Then what?  I didn't see anything else."  More pixels...is it a clown?  Elvis?  Even with all that information, still I pretended we had a relationship.  Even with the 8-track of her greatest hits in my head ("you'll never be any good with money," "why don't you get a real job to fall back on?" and "you never take the time to do anything right") I wasn't exactly getting it.  I know that, if you've had  that  conversation with your mother but she keeps forgetting you're gay there's something not connecting, but, no,  I couldn't be right because I never take the time to do  anything  right.  What was the breaking point?  Probably something about finances, our very last connection (she's had a rich, full life, I want my money now).  Maybe it was the fact that she didn't know the name or any of the details of the Off-Broadway show I'd been in for a year.  Whatever it was, the light bulb came on, the light shifted, or maybe nothing changed at all.  But I could see the Magic Eye in full focus.  It was a picture of my relationship with my mother.  And I was the only one in it.  Mother's Day.  I guess I've been mothered (and fathered) by a lot of people throughout the years, non-traditionally and surprisingly so, but I'm a big boy now and I'll take over whatever parenting needs to be done from here on out.    Happy Mother's Day to me.

        Uneasy Rider  Usually the Big Orange Bike brings me much happiness; carries me on its Handlebars of Love to a higher plane where I find relaxation and a much-needed sense of peace.  Not yesterday.   Nooooooo .  Yesterday it was the Ride of Hatred.  I got home more tense than when I'd left.  Angry.   Really  angry.  And all due to one, stupid reason:  People.  Grrrffff!  Okay, the misanthrope's outta the bag...I hate people.  I don't wanna chat with you in the elevator about the weather.  I don't wanna discuss the items in my grocery cart.  I don't wanna know what the doctor told you about that mole and I could care less about who's in your house this season.  But it's far worse for me on the street.  People are everywhere and it seems there's just no stopping them.  Funny, it sometimes doesn't occur to me that there will be people outside, and once I'm out it's usually too late.  Besides, sometimes they're  inside , too.  Last night, they were mostly outside.  And they irk me.  Maybe it's because I'm getting old, or I've lived in New York too long.  Maybe it's because I'm a Virgo.  But I'll bet it's just because I'm right.  Here are the basics:  One goes to a bike/blading/jogging path to well, bike, blade or jog.  There's a large swath dedicated to those who want to stroll (with or without strollers), sit on benches, chat, etc.  There are two  much smaller  lanes dedicated to the bikers/bladers/joggers.  Each of those smaller paths has, not only a bike and roller blade painted on it at regular intervals (there are no joggers painted there, but we bikers/bladers are a generous people), but some directional arrows as well.  Directional arrows point in specific directions, to guide the aforementioned bikers/bladers/joggers.  This all seems easy so far, right?  But now comes the ugly part.  Into this neatly ordered system, one tosses the ugliest element:  people.  So there are people ambling along on the bike/blade/jog path, walking three abreast and against traffic, absolutely stunned when they see a bike heading straight for them.  So they do the logical thing.  Stand there and gape.  Bikers in the narrowest part of the path, decide this is the absolute best place to bike next to their friend, despite the bikers/bladers/joggers trying to squeeze by them on the other side.  Joggers who see each other coming from separate directions and stop where they are for a nice catch-up chat.  Bladers who toss their backpacks down in the middle of both paths do dance and practice jumping.  My very favorite from last night was a guy on a scooter, cell phone in one hand, dog on an extended leash in the other hand...blocking...the...ENTIRE...PATH!  My head very nearly exploded.  Now, you must think I'm a cranky old monster and I need to clear this up for you:  I am.  But, like Hannibal Lechter, while I might eat your brother without blinking, I abhor rudeness.  We live in a Big City and manners are the only things keeping us from, well bludgeoning scooter-riding, cellphone-chatting, inconsiderate dog owners.  I take great pains to make sure I co-exist with my fellow New Yorkers.  While I might fervently wish I was the only one living here, I'm very well aware I'm not and I live in public in such a way that allows me my personal freedom and space while being considerate of the personal freedom and space of others.  Is this such a foreign concept?  Am I a total freak?  Yes, I should've known better than to think I'd have a relaxing bike ride by the Hudson at sunset on a Friday evening in Manhattan.  And, yes, in the future, I'll avoid that crowd much as I do the Matinee Theatre Crowd, the Times Square Movie Opening Weekend Crowd, and Every Crowd at G.  But, really, why should I have to?  Why must I keep myself further insulated because of the sharp increase in ill-mannered citizens?  Ah well...every day a little death...

       Who Are The People In  Your  Neighborhood?  Just when I'm ready to desert midtown, it starts getting  urlLink really exciting .  I ask you, how did The Post resist calling it the "Carnage Deli?"  My two biggest regrets about this?  First, that it wasn't five evil, slow-moving, dog distracting, midtown-littering tourists that were shot.  And, second, that my apartment rated much lower in drug activity than I had previously anticipated.  It's strange that these people were killed this way over pot.  I could understand if it were crystal, but if they'd only smoked a little of their own product, this probably wouldn't have happened.  I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the  urlLink Carnegie Deli  had something to do with installing a pot dealer in their building.  I mean, c'mon...built in munchies on the first floor!  But I'll tell ya, I've never seen so many cops and detectives in my life.  It's like they were giving away  urlLink doughnuts  and  urlLink bad shoes  -- it just might've blown my cop fantasy to smithereens.  I hope all the  urlLink neighborhood   urlLink bloggers  survived the bloodbath.  One theatrical footnote to this story:  neighborhood gossip has it that the apartment where the killings occurred used to be  urlLink Bob Fosse's  office (Hey  urlLink Mermaniac , d'ya think after they shot those people they said " urlLink I gotta pee " before they ran?).  Also midtown today, just four blocks south of my apartment (and Satan's Li'l Deli),  urlLink Destiny's Child  performed on the Today Show.  This is really the first time I've talked publicly about the group since I was ousted, but I feel I can now.  I don't wanna get mired in "she said-she said" or who called who what, I just wanna wish the girls all the success in the world and state once more for the record that talent is more than looking good in a halter and some trashy  urlLink culottes  (besides, my problem is  glandular ).  They knew when I joined the group that I was first and foremost a singer and I didn't wanna get trapped in selling my body.  I think it sends a bad message and distracts from the music.  But they have a vision and so I went quietly.  To show I hold no bitterness whatsoever, this weekend I intend on taking my former bandmates to dinner.  Gee, I hope they like deli food...

       Spatial Olympics  Another court date, another reprieve...for a month, at least.  But different this time.  Last time I had to go to court, I was all "snatched up" as my drag queen friends used to say, serving total  urlLink Alexis Carrington  Judicial Realness.  This time I threw some goo in my hair, pulled on an Old Navy polo shirt ($6.95) and a pair of reasonably serious-looking gray slacks (Structure, probably $19.99).  Last time I was an hour early, this time I got there at 9:20am for a 9:30am start.  Didn't know if the Landlord's attorney was there, didn't so much care.  Why?  Where was the panic?  There was none, and I now realize why:  I'm ready to let this apartment go.  Anyone out there want The Deal of the Century in Luxurious  urlLink Midtown Manhattan  then hurry yer ass on over, 'cause it's goin' fast.    It's a great apartment.  Most of my friends' apartments would fit into it with room to spare.  I have a foyer; I have a dishwasher; I have doormen.  I'm also its Bitch.  Oh yeah!  Everyday it sends me out to whore myself at The Evil Empire (or worse) to bring it back some cash, which it blows right through then asks for more.  When the Cathoholic and I moved into the apartment 11 years ago, we paid $1,000 a month and we split it.  Now, all by myself after six years and several rent increases, I calculate I've spent a total of (those of you living in other parts of the country might want to sit down for this) approximately $95,000.  I could've bought a house for that.  Or a car.  Or a really,  really  hot  urlLink hooker .  You know what I'm gonna buy instead?   A clue, ladies and gentlemen.  Why did I move to New York?  For a really great apartment?  Don't think so.  I came here to continue my dream of being a working actor; to be a working artist among other working artists.  So what's my payoff for staying stuck in this place, literally and figuratively?  I've thought about that and I've had some really great answers, too ("it's my home," and "what I pay for the space I have?  I'd be crazy to move"), but here's the ugly truth:  It's my excuse for failure that I think I am.   Can't take time off work to audition, 'cause I have to work to make rent.  Shouldn't even audition for that show, 'cause it wouldn't even cover my rent.  I sorry I can't do the workshop of your new play, I have to work at night to pay my rent.   I've said all of those and more.  And let me tell ya, I'm plenty talented.  I own that.  But when you don't get cast in things day after month after year, it wears you down a little; I feel like I own that, too.  When kids you worked with in summer stock are getting sitcoms and ex-boyfriends are getting Tonys, and you can't even get a lousy national tour 'cause you don't fit the pre-existing costume...well, it sure does help to have that 1,100 square foot, plaster and concrete excuse.   I'm happy about their careers, but I've gotta pay the rent.   Now, I'm not a stupid boy, but what have I been thinking?  Have I really let an apartment fuck me up this much?  The double-hung closet was staring me in the face all the time and I didn't get it.  When I finally kicked the Cathoholic out, I'm sure I needed to stay there to sort myself out.  But it's not really my home.  It's an apartment where I've lived a long time.  Sort of lived.  More like  hidden .  It's just a space.  I'm a good Southern boy and all, but...fuck  urlLink Tara ...I'm movin' in with  urlLink Belle Watling .  Time to move on psychically, emotionally, and physically.  The other night walking through the East Village, there was something exciting in the air.  Part of it was definitely my  urlLink date .  But there was just energy there.  Good, creative energy.   That's  why I moved to New York.  I need to re-connect with  that .  So I'll sublet.  I'll pare down.  I'll get a roommate.  Whatever.  But I'll free m'self up and get back to bidness, baby.  I was reading an  urlLink amazing post   by my new Bloguru, The Miss Cleo of Blogdom, FlipCity.  It felt like heat coming off of my screen (and not 'cause I'm a big Xanadu freak...well, not  just  'cause).   Inspiration .  And also perspective.  I've been  Suspended in Time,  Flip.  I could still be looking at all of this as a mess, but it's turning out to be my real path.   I've got to believe we are magic, nothing can stand in our way...   I need to refill my artistic and spiritual well.  It seems that I've reached that place where I have nothing to lose, so I have nothing to fear...and it's exhilirating.  From now on my life is gonna be about supporting that forward motion; supporting the creativity.  The rest is just empty space.   Now...  about Flip's reading of my date with the abso-fuckin'-lutely adorable RJ:  Item 1:   The hamburgers were actually grilled chicken burgers with bacon, on hamburger bun-like ciabbattina rolls  Item 2:   It was "going as well as those things could possibly go."  Better, actually.  High comfort level.  At least for me.  Item 3:   Awkward?  Yeah, we danced around it, but I think the hesitation was as much about enjoying each other dressed as gettin' it on...  Item 4:   "Looks like they laughed a lot"  Is there anything better?  Item 5:   "Very high snot factor."  It was me, okay?  OKAY?  My sinuses had started filling up earlier and Dr. RJ gave me some tablets which helped, but not in the long run.  I actually got worse and worse and don't even remember walking the dog when I got home.  I'm better now.  Just a light stuffiness and sore throat, but I don't want any special treatment...  Item 6:   We  played  the soundtrack (I loves me some Shirley Bassey), but I left without it.  My doing or his?  Item 7:   Didn't get no panties, neither.  But in all fairness, I believe RJ was wearing borrowed drawers (sorry honey, but that's what you told me).  Item 8:  Sequel ?  You betcha.  Just as soon as we can be sure that snot isn't one of the body fluids being slung around.  A Note to the Curious: RJ's real name is...yeah, right.  I'll tell ya this much:  the man's smart and hilarious; an attentive and generous listener; has groovy energy; knows everybody in the East Village; has not exaggerated about how fantastic his particular ass is; and a helluva kisser.  If you wanna know anything else, yer gonna have to win a contest yerself, hippy!

       I...Can't...Remember...A... Thing ...  My head is foggy, my eyes are puffy and nearly swollen shut, there's pressure in my T-zone.  I must look like hell because, when I awoke mysteriously in my own bed, Rex was standing over me with a worried expression.  What's happened to me?  I don't remember a lot about last night.  I remember meeting in front of a New York landmark and then being walked around until I became disoriented.  I think I was force fed some sort of potatoe product that may or may not have included squid.  At this point the first attempt at poisoning me took place in the guise of an herbaly mayonnaise.  I guess I should have suspected something was wrong where there was no mention whatsover of blogs.  And since I was barely allowed to speak, I think the constant flow of words acted as a hypnotic.  Some kind men on the street tried to warn me, yelling that I wasn't human, that I was becoming a haunted fucking ghost, they even showed me a former victim lying on the street next to his cane, but I didn't listen.  And that made it all the easier to finally drug me with that eclair.  I'm sure it was the eclair.  Lured up a steep and very narrow staircase, telling me that's where my free cd was, I followed unwittingly.  Of course there was no cd, it turned out to be the lid of a coffee cup.  And then the eclair was produced.  It looked delicious but the cream had a bitter, venomous aftertaste...like Cream of Tartar.  I really began to slip at this point, although I could still hear voices.  For instance, I heard him discuss with one of his accomplices the intricacies of vacuum-sealing me (and I thank goddess that this plan, at least, was abandoned).  After that I only have flashes of the horrors that were inflicted on me:  my hand forced to stroke several pussies, my head slapped with a tea bag, being forced to sit on a cheesecake.  I guess, ultimately, I'm glad I blacked out.  All I really know for sure this morning is:  these aren't my socks and I have a strong craving for smoked mullet.

       My Dawg's Better'n Yer Dawg  In the excitement of winning sex and previously-owned undergarments, I forgot to mention Rex the Wonder Puffin's special day.  He had three (3) Celebrity Encounters (which, frankly, is a step up from the chick magnet he's been to this point).  So with all due respect to other  urlLink Blog Dogs , here's Rex's Glamorous Day:  On our morning walk, as we passed the hotel next door,  urlLink Anne Robinson  was waiting for a taxi and pronounced my dog "The Cutest Link!"  Okay, she just said to him "Hello, aren't you cute?"  On our last walk, right in front of our house, talking into his cellphone, was  urlLink Bradley Whitford  ("Josh" from The West Wing).  He didn't really look at me, or stop talking on his phone, but spent a few minutes scratching Rexie's fuzzy little head and chest.  I was waiting for my turn, but alas, he's married.  To a woman.  But the biggest encounter came when we were leaving the Park in the afternoon.  As we were crossing CPS, a woman with a headset asked if we'd like to be in a movie.  I, jaded New Yorker (and SAG member) that I am, said no.  She said, "Awww, ya sure?  We really like your dog."  Of course I relented immediately.  She asked us to cross the street when the two actors on the other street started crossing and to pass them in the middle of CPS.  So, of course we did.  The two actors?  Meg Ryan and  urlLink Hugh Jackman .  My dog will forever have an endless supply of steak and smelly socks just for getting me that close to Hugh Jackman (mmm...Wolverine-licious).  All of that and RJ's soiled panties.  Maybe life's not so bad.

       The Luck of the Bloggish   Oh I'm proud to be an  urlLink Eastcoast/Westcoast   urlLink Weiner , That is what I truly like to be. 'Cuz now that I'm an  urlLink Eastcoast/Westcoast   urlLink Weiner , Flip & RJ'll be in  urlLink love  with me...   Wow.  I'm  overwhelmed .  But the number nine and it's multiples have always been lucky for me: lotteries, dice, inches...  I was born on the eighteenth day of the ninth month in a year that also adds up to nine.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.  And now this.  As the wise and sexy creature who encouraged me to blog told me, "Blogging'll get you dates."  So it is written, so it shall be done!  My only regret is that I won't get a psychic reading with my sex and  urlLink undies , but I'm not greedy.  Now I've gotta get ready for my date...do I look  urlLink fat  in  urlLink this ?

       Runyonland  Sometimes I feel like one of the Ghosts of Manhattan.  I drift through the Times Square of 2001 and, sure, I see Planet Hollywood and the WWF Mega-restaurant, but I also see the statues of  urlLink the stage divas of 1910  still peeking from behind that Sbarro's sign and the old subway entrance, now sealed up, that used to lead up into the  urlLink Knickerbocker Hotel .  I also see a lot things that aren't there anymore, like the Hotel Astor (where the MTV studios are) or the Old Dutch Mill, an open-air beergarden that used to sit on the roof of the  urlLink New Victory Theatre .  I know that old theatre that serves as the entrance to the AMC Empire 25 movie theatre used to be the Eltinge, built and named for  urlLink Julian Eltinge , a very popular turn-of-the-century performer who performed in mainstream dramas in drag.  I even know where there's an archway that used to lead to a boardinghouse where Valentino lived before he went to Hollywood...the archway is all that's left of it.  I could go on and on...  So it always makes me sad to see a building being torn down.  It's another chunk of Manhattan's heart that can't ever be replaced.  Who knows what went on in there; what secrets were told; what private dramas played out?  But sometimes there's also a secret revealed, usually in the form of an advertisement painted on the side of a building.  It's small consolation for the loss, but maybe it's the Spirit of the City gently reminding those of us that love here not to dispair:  there's always more, hidden maybe...but all of those other Manhattans still exist somewhere, somehow.  Running an errand today, I stepped out of a building on 42nd Street and Madison and noticed that the building on the southwest corner was gone.  Wow.  I didn't know anything interesting about that corner, but it's 42nd Street...might've been important once.  As I was pondering what details I remembered about that building (I got my first cellphone there, and once applied at a temp agency in it), my eye wandered up to the now-exposed buildings surrounding it.  And there, on the building that sits on the southeast corner of 42nd and Fifth, high up and painted in big, white letters arranged around a lone window, it said:   urlLink Rogers Peet Co.   Without hesitation (and to the consternation of my fellow pedestrians) I stopped in my tracks saying out loud "Golf!  Galoshes!  Ovaltine!!"  And I sang " urlLink Marry the Man Today " all the way home.  That sign'll be obscured when the newest concrete box is erected, but for today, just for a second, I got to live in Runyonland...

       Useless Landscape  Did you hear that thudding sound last night?  Don't be concerned, it was just me falling off the wagon...  Yup, I'm a freakin' Tower of  urlLink Jello .  I caved like a house o' cards.  But you know what?  It was really good, and not at all in the way I expected.  I mentioned in an earlier post that the SF Potential BF was coming to town.  This is a guy who's a friend of some of my best friends, we'd never met, but I kept seeing his picture in various vacation snapshots and every time I'd say "who's that?"  It was always him.  Apparently, he was having the same experience in reverse.  Then eventually we traded some saucy email, then IMs, etc.  And, while I think he's very cute and smart, (a) he lives in San Francisco and I've already done my Bicoastal Courting for this lifetime and (b) he's the Poster Boy for Reticence.  Well, he was in town this weekend, but I'd picked up lots of shifts at The Evil Empire, so I didn't think I'd get a chance to meet him.  No big deal.  As it happens, I got out of work much earlier yesterday and got sucked into dinner plans with the boys.  Okay, I was a little curious.  SFPBF completely didn't expect me and seemed really pleasantly surprised.  He's also cuter than his pictures.  So we went to dinner.  My friends are always a great audience, but apparently last night I was Shecky Freakin' Blogstalker.  From dinner we lost one friend and picked up two others, barhopped from Rawhide, to The View, to Barracuda...hadn't done this for months and it was kinda fun.  Ran into people I knew at every place we went, which for some idiotic reason impressed SFPBF.  He was being flirty, but only as long as I wasn't responding too much.  The minute I flirted back even a little seriously, he withdrew.  Then they were off to  urlLink The Roxy .  I stopped going to The Roxy, Twilo, etc. and the pharmaceutical accessories that go with those places because, frankly, it became boring.  Also, I got tired of feeling like low-grade crap for two days after and missing out on time I could've been wasting in better ways.  I had no desire to go, but I was still curious about this boy and whether he'd actually let himself go.  So I decided I'd walk them them over, since I knew Derek the doorman would wave us on through and they wouldn't have to wait in that ridiculous line.  Then they started with "just come in for a little while."  For some foolish reason ('cause I'm  definitely  not A-List) I have a Gold Card and I never have to pay to get in, so I figured, what the hell, dance with the kids a bit and then go home.  Hadn't stepped foot in there since New Year's Eve...but it's always, exactly the same.  Cuteness, Hilarity, Tragedy, Intrigue...usually all in the same boy.  But the music was good, I saw a couple more friends who had the decency not to mention I've gained some weight, so it seemed novel.  We drifted out onto the dance floor, found a good spot, and then they all started taking Circuit Communion, popping  urlLink Disco Biscuits  like  urlLink Mentos .  I was offered one and not wanting to be on a different wavelength...and also out of curiosity...I took one.  Not curiosity about what it was like, Goddess knows I know what it's like.  I actually feel that the drugs I've consumed in the past have actually expanded my world in a good way, almost in a  necessary  way.  But I also feel like they've served their purpose in my life.  So a part of me wanted to see if I was just kidding myself.  I learned two things last night:  (a) while I won't say  never , my pseudo-Circuit Boy phase is over and I'm not only okay with that, I'm relieved.  And number two?  Some hidden spring of self-worth burbled up in me last night and I realized I'm not interested in a boy I have to chase.  I know he's interested 'cause, when, after a couple of hours I decided, to everyone's dismay, that I was leaving (I used to be the last man standing), SFPBF  finally  made a decisive move in my direction and gave me The Long Kiss Goodbye, asking if I was sure I didn't want to stay.  Yup, I was sure.  Not in a bitter way, not with any resentment...very calmly sure I was ready to go.  Look, I'm 38.  I've been gay all my life and I've been out since I was 15.  I've played all sorts of games.  I'm done with 'em.  I stated my interest, left a door  and  a window open.  If you don't have the balls or the  sense  to come on in, then you're not the man for me, it's just that simple.  [I just read that last sentence...is that really  me  saying that?  Cool!]  So I sit here this afternoon almost pleased with my  urlLink hangover  headache, thinking of it more as the final achiness of some  urlLink growing pains ; the warm-soreness of stretching some self-esteem muscles that haven't been exercised in too long.   Anybody wanna buy a  urlLink John Blair Gold Card ?

       The Beautiful Room Is Empty  It has occurred to me this week that every room has it's own climate regions.  Pockets of energy and feeling, some obvious and some not until disturbed by cleaning or redecorating, and especially by the act of packing up.  Should've been obvious, huh?  I didn't expect it.  Books with an inscription that make me cry, written by a guy who doesn't even remember me when I pass him on the street.  An old dog toy belonging to a now-dead cocker spaniel, the child of my first marriage.  Confetti from a hilarious New Year's Eve party that was also one hell of a romantic evening.  A champage cork from that same evening.  Shorts I bought for the White Party four years ago from the "What The Hell Was I Thinking" collection.  A shirt I borrowed one really rainy night 20-something years ago from a friend that left me too soon...the same shirt that I wore back to my mother's house that morning that caused my mother to confront me about my homosexuality.  The very first Playbill that my name appeared in.  The shoes I bought in the mall in New Jersey the day I got the call my father died.  It's like some incredibly emotional acid trip.  I don't know where it's going and I can't really stop it for very long.  But it's also moving energy around in me and in my space that has to be good.  Opening a long-sealed window and allowing the fresh air to mingle with the mustiness, but probably not to ever clear it completely.  I'm lucky, I have a big apartment.  And when the Cathaholic and I broke up, it got even bigger (and twice as expensive).  We moved in about 11 years ago, broke up six years ago...I'm still finding his stuff.  Some of it's funny, some of it's sad, some of it's infuriating.  I find other people's stuff, too.  When you have an apartment bigger than  other people's  in Manhattan, it becomes a repository for  other people's  detritus.  Two chairs brought over for Thanksgiving dinner two years ago ("I'll get them eventually.  They fold up, and besides your apartment's huge"), 6 boxes of my ex's Christmas ornaments ("You don't put up a tree, so they're taking up the space you'd use if you did.  Besides, your apartment's huge"), pans and platters from a friend's 40th birthday party three years ago ("Just hang on to them, we'll use them for the next party.  Besides, your apartment's huge"), an envelope of mail belonging to a friend of a friend who stopped by six months ago ("I'll get them when I'm back from Hawaii.  It's old stuff...besides, your apartment's huge").  Y'know what?  With everybody else's stuff, plus my own, plus the dog's things...my huge apartment's getting smaller by the minute.  I'm not Chelsea Storage, people!  My heart's the same way, but I'll die without anybody knowing it.  Maybe I won't leave.  Maybe I won't have to.  Maybe I won't want to.  No one can believe I'm capable of leaving New York, I've been here so long and I seem like such a New Yorker.  But a shift has to happen and, whether I knew it or not, the physical act of packing up is sending ripples inward, the reverse of a pebble in a pond; an object hits the bottom of the box, and I feel it in my gut.  So I'm following it, object by object, box by box, and I'm hoping for a shift in energy/emotion/direction.  I hope it's enough.

       From The Desk Of...  I've been all alone today at The Evil Empire.  Not only alone, no work.  Nada.  No one's even been in my enclosure.  Actually, that's not true...the vending machine guy came in here by mistake.  So I've surfed, I've blogstalked, I've read, I've snacked (healthfully), and, scariest of all:  I've thought.  Well, since you asked:  Giving up Diet Coke --  urlLink which I love, too  -- has proven to be much harder than I thought.  But I was influenced by a semingly sensible (and damned entertaining)  urlLink blog stranger ...and so I'm trying.  Maybe I'll buy a juicer.  Sometimes, during the day, I miss my dog and my bike.  Okay, it's worse than that:  I just heard that song "Groovin'" on the radio, and I thought it could easily be about me and Rex.  Of course, in high school, I thought Barry Manilow's "Mandy" was about a boy and his dog.  Muttering "move it, fatass" just audibly enough behind slow, stupid tourists doesn't seem to speed them up.  Sometimes it confuses them enough so you can maneuver around them, though.  Somebody  Oughta  Beat  urlLink The Wiz .  The sexiest boy I blogstalked today?  Why, it's  urlLink him ...  Where was The Mummy before he Returned?  When I read  urlLink this blog , I usually end up feeling like I wanna give him a big hug, and then be his Mrs. Robinson...is that so wrong?  Somewhere along the line I've moved into Junior  urlLink Daddy  Status...and I don't think I mind...  I believe it was the sage,  urlLink Abe Burrows  who said, "Coffee is so good, I can't understand why it isn't a sin."  The thing that impressed the Math Genius most about my last year?  That I slept with one of his favorite entertainment news anchors...  What happened to anyone behind a counter  anywhere  having manners?  When a fairly successful Broadway actress, who hasn't stopped working for the past six or so years and will probably be nominated for a Tony this year is complaining about how much she hates her job, how the producers mistreat her, and how she's too good for this show, how do I gently intimate that perhaps I'm not the best audience for this rant?  Perhaps I'll stop and get a chicken product of some sort.  And then take my boyfriend, er,  dog , to the park...

       Goin' Courtin'  I meant to be up early today, I swear to Goddess (does  urlLink Sturtle  have a copyright on that?).  I mean, I had to go to court and respond to my Eviction Notice (more on that later).  But Fates (and 25-year-olds) conspired against me.  Out of nowhere, Kickboxing Boy showed up.  Well, he called first.  I guess I could've said no, but I remember him being really fun.  I misremembered.  Y'know how there are peripheral people in your life that you like but don't really think much about until you run across them accidentally and through some inadvertant piece of information you find out that you're  far  more important in their life than they are in yours?  That's Kickboxing Boy.  He told me he'd never gotten flowers from someone he really liked until I sent them backstage when I saw his Off-Off-Off-Off-Might-As-Well-Have-Been-Omaha-Off-Broadway show.  I smiled a sickly smile, thinking back on how horrendous that experience was, how poorly written the play was, and how talent-free I found him to be.  Yes, Daddy had to commit Green Room Perjury.  And there was something of a payoff in having a fucking adorable 25-year-old boy hanging off of you while you stroll to Avenue A for sushi.  But the bottom line is the chemistry doesn't flow to me from his direction, although, damn it all, I wish it did.  Anyway, I could've said no.  After I'd told him he could come over and hung up, I wish I'd said no.  I immediately went to the Cupboard of Vice to scrape together a little bump of something to make me more interested in it all...but, really, the Cupboard of Vice was bare.  From two old bottles and grinder residue, I got maybe a quarter of a pathetic little bump of crystal that I promptly sneezed back out.  Just as well, I suppose.  KB arrived, there was some awkward conversation, some bland making out, and it just went downhill from there.  It's happened, I suppose:  I'm bored with sex.  Or perhaps just unconnected sex.  I can't make it up, I can't pretend I'm enjoying it, but I'm also not conveying that boredom apparently, because KB was out of his mind enjoying it.  Swell.  When it finally, mercifully ended it occurred to me that he thought he might be staying the night.  Ohhhh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Finally, Wonder Pup (oh jeez, let's give him an alias...how 'bout Rex?), decided he needed to go out, so everyone had to get dressed and move to the door.  Well, we walked Rex (while I yawned and bitched about having to get up SO early for court), came upstairs, I yawned and bitched some more...hints were falling so fast and heavy my living room was practically a Hardhat Zone.  Finally, KB decided he might as well get home and let me get some quality sleep.  Which I didn't really.  I finally pulled Rex off my face around 10:30, made breakfast while practicing my landlord speech, and, bolstered with 2 cups of fine Five O'Clock Roast and some instant grits, I called The Landlord.  I guess he was mostly decent, but the veiled threats were annoying.   Yeah, I know how much more you could get for this apartment.  Nooo, of course you're not suggesting you want me out.   At any rate, while he agreed to take a partial payment for the moment, I still had to trek down to  urlLink Foley Square .  I hopped on the Big Orange Bike (if there was anyone actually reading this, I'd be concerned about how many times I mention the B.O.B., but as it is, fuck 'em) and zipped down, prepared to meet the face of the Ignorant and Rude Government Lackey.  And you know what?  I was delightfully surprised.  The woman who helped me was informed, pleasant, energetic and really helpful.  So I have a stay of execution, until next Thursday.  I'm still packing up.  In the meantime, I've picked up extra shifts here at The Evil Empire, actually applied at  urlLink Starbuck's  this afternoon, have priceless ephemera which needs to find a price and quick, but I'm not so interested in seeing people.  This has pissed JSquared off since he'd planned a big outing for the opening of  urlLink The Mummy Returns  tomorrow night.  I, of course, had been given the honor of finding out where and when the latest show was, determining how many people were going (mostly  not  my friends) and walking over to the theatre and purchasing the tickets (with my own money).  All this while JSquared sat in the Park watching the  urlLink Broadway Show League  play this afternoon, then go meet a pal for coffee.  Did I mention I'd been to court, applied for a part-time job at the CoffeeBorg and had to be at work by 3:30pm?  I got the show info, relayed it, and declined to further involvement (to the tune of " why ?").  Aw, hell...maybe it's just me.  Is it too late to change the name of this to WhinyBlog?

       'Cause Everything Is Rent  Another month, another eviction notice...same door, though.  Does that mean I'm winning?  This one seems to be a Five Day Notice.  Five days, huh?  Five days to pack up 11 years of my life?  Or what?  The same thing that happened to  urlLink Pozlife ?  Grooooovy.  And I don't even have a  urlLink Slutboy  to help.  I feel that I've taxed my friends to their limit, so, as usual, I'm waaay on my own.  I'll just negotiate, wheedle, and argue, while I pack up, sell off, and prepare.  It's just the next chapter, right?  Maybe I'm not despondent because of the Wonder Pup and the Big Orange Bike.  The combination of the two of them have remarkably cheered me.  Even raised my energy level.  Funny, when I was eight years old, I got a puppy and (weird, now that I think of it) an orange five speed bike (that I didn't know how to ride).  Thirty years later, I got a puppy and a bike on the same day.  What exactly does that mean?  Incidentally, The Addict (from whence came the Big Orange Bike) just called.  Didn't leave a message, but he left his footprints in Caller ID.  I'm not going to get caught in that particular detox.  I tried, I was treated abysmally, I'm done.  I've given to that relationship with absolutely no return and I reached the end...sad to say, he's on  his   urlLink own , too.  [It's turned into quite the little  urlLink Irene Cara  blog, hasn't it?  What a feeling...]  JJ had a comp to  urlLink The Music Man  last night, so I used it.  I wasn't looking forward to it, haven't performed in it once and directed it once, but I enjoyed it in spite of myself.  It's a smart, dated book that went over the heads of most of the cut-off jean wearing audience (would these people dress the same way going to the theatre in their hometowns?), and some of the performances were hardly Broadway calibre (frankly,  I'd  make a more convincing 8-year old Iowa girl), but I still cried.  And I was still surprised by some amazingly smart, fresh choices (love ya, Stro!).  And that Craig Bierko?  Charming as hell.  And Mark Moreau if you read this, you make the most adorable faces when you dance.  Here's what made me cry the most, with apologies to Meredith Willson:   All I want is a plain man, All I want is a modest man A quiet man, a gentle man, a straightforward and honest man To live with me, in a cottage  Somewhere in the State of Iowa And I would like him to be More interested in me Than he is in himself And more interested in us Than in me.  And if occasion'lly he'd ponder What makes Shakespeare and Beethoven great Him I could love 'til I die Him I could love 'til I die...   Okay, so I'm a fag...what's your point?

       Puffy Fuffbay!  Wow, the Wonder Pup's a year old today!  That means we've been together for nine months.  Adopting him was the smartest thing I ever did...he's  literally  saved my life.  Through all of this recent mess, when I'd reached that emotional cliff, ready to clean out the medicine cabinet, I'd stop myself because I didn't want my boy to have to go back to the Humane Society, or worse.  I did, one night, think (briefly) about taking him with me, but I finally decided that was far too Egyptian and would only land us as a filler item in the  urlLink Post .  And now I've become one of those people with random dog hair on his shirts and a funny story about how the puppy sleeps on my head sometimes.  It's okay, I have love.  When he decides it's a terrific idea to stretch out on top of me and watch tv, or when he comes over in the middle of an unexplained crying jag and cocks his head at me, or, almost best yet, on our way back from the dog run or the Park and he keeps looking up at my like I'm his only hero...well, hell, roll me in dog hair, I've got love.  I also love the Big Orange Bike.  JJ and I let the river run again...besides the great exercise, you get tan, hairy daddies, tattooed alterna-skaters, straight boys in suits, Sam Champion enjoying his own weather, happy secretaries in real-flower leis, yachts with helicopters on top...Summer gooooooood.  Fire still baaaaad, though.  Even though we've already been to the dog run and Petland (for treats and a new collar), I'm surprising my boy (do I have to protect  his  anonymity, too?) by taking him on an unscheduled run in the Park before I go to see The Music Man (please, it's free) and then cocktails with JJ and some random boys at Bar Rage.

       Reduce Speed Ahead  So I'm at the gym, doing arms, the gym's not full and I have nowhere to be until tomorrow at 1pm.  And I'm antsy.  I can't get through it quickly enough.  I'm distracted and trying to figure out what I can do later or in the morning.  How I can rearrange entire chunks of my life?  How can I start on the next exercise while I'm resting from the previous?  And I said it out loud:  "Slow down."  Why is that so hard for me to remember?  Doing things step by step, being only in the moment in which I exist, taking my time...these do not compute.  It's impatience.  It's anxiety.  What it  isn't  is, in actuality, moving my life forward in any way.  I get overwhelmed.  I start thinking about the next thing that needs to be done before the first one is finished.  You should see me trying to clean my apartment.  I start in the bedroom, say, cleaning the top of my dresser.  I find something that needs to go in the living room.  I take it to its proper shelf and I realize it needs dusting.  I go to the kitchen to get the Endust and a rag and, under the sink is that lighting fixture that I keep meaning to put up in the dining room.  So I pull it out and put it on the dining room table so I'll remember to do it right after...right after.  Oh yeah, the dresser in the bedroom.  Is this A.D.D.?  Or am I just a scatterbrained mess?  (Remember when submitting your answer that the former comes with delicious pharmaceuticals.)  I've got to force myself to slow down, do one thing at a time.  I can't skip over the mundane tasks of life, I have attend to each and allow each to take the time it takes.  But how do I remember to do that?  Tape notes all around the apartment?  Meditation?  Yoga?  Quaaludes?  This should be interesting...  If you run into me, remind me to slow down, okay?

       Boo Hoo, Poor Me  First and foremost, I must announce to all of Blogdom and beyond:   urlLink Ultrasparky  is Ultragroovy!  We'd decided that it was just time to hang out and, as far as I'm concerned, it was way  past  time.  Anyone who's up for a spontaneous trip to The Lure and can match me story for story is okay in my book.  I'm thinking with a little rest and an earlier start our adventures could keep Blogville entertained for quite some time.  I wonder if we can talk  urlLink anyone else  into joining our hijinks?  After a summer evening of walking around the City, making a new friend, pointing out former conquests or those we've nearly done, discussing happy couples, etc., I of course grew melancholy.  I left Sparky at the subway on 14th Street and started to walk up Eighth Avenue, tired but stalling.  Really, why rush to get home?  When I get there, it'll be the same thing: step over nearly-packed boxes, survey the dog's immediate area and determine whether or not he's peed, take him out for a quick walk, check email, check the answering machine, have a glass of Diet Coke, turn on the air in the bedroom, take out my contacts, brush my teeth, and try to sleep.  I've been leaving the radio or the tv on when I go out -- for the dog I tell myself -- but isn't it so the place won't be so quiet when I get back?  There's a television in practically every room, there are speakers for the stereo in the bedroom, there's a radio/cassette player in the bathroom...it's never quiet, there's always sound, always a party until I finally turn off the tv in the bedroom to force myself to sleep.  Then I lie there in my king-sized bed, alone, hugging a pillow until it's too hot, then turn it over for the cooler side, wondering why I'm so unlovable.  I've been alone a long time and I'm lonely.  It never used to bother me, being alone, after all I'm an only child who grew up in a single-parent home where I was left mostly to my own devices.  But now I notice the alone-ness.  I have friends I can do things with, acquaintences I can run into by just stepping outside, and we have a great time; they know who I am and care about me.  I still come home alone.  I still wake up alone.  I have my coffee alone, I sit on the sofa alone, I make dinner for one.  I can't even tell you where my other placemats are, I've only needed one for so long.  I'm becoming sad to myself, too set in my ways and maybe just a little crazy.  There's an old guy who lives on the fourth floor of my building.  He's probably in his late sixties.  Was a writer, now just does the occasional freelance job.  Mutters to himself.  If you look up at our building from the street, his apartment is the one that has newspaper over the windows instead of curtains.  He doesn't even use the front door to his apartment anymore, only his kitchen entrance.  The doorman tells me with a chuckle that it's because there's so much newspaper and junk stacked in his apartment he can't get through the front door anymore.  When I see him on the street and he passes a payphone, he sticks his finger in the coin return and fishes around to see if someone's left some change.  He doesn't care what he wears anymore, it's all too baggy, a cacophony of plaids, and there's a musty smell to him.  Sometimes he dyes his hair, but then it grows out for months before he dyes it again, and so the auburn at the tips is a far cry from the white at the base.  And no one talks to him.  Including me.  Sure he's a little crazy, and a little hard of hearing, but he's also alone in the world.  And I'm becoming him.  I'm terrified that Peter was it.  That was my shot.  It was so close to perfection for awhile but I wanted more communication, more feeling, and I ruined it and all chances of anything else even close to it ever again.  I'm condemned to a future of sometimes-decent sex with guys who project images onto me for the duration of that act, or who want to date what they  think  I am but can't handle or aren't interested in the reality, until the day that even  those  offers stop coming.  Seven years since Peter.  Seven years of dating guys I tried my best to pretend I had chemistry with.  Dating elements of personalities, but not complete men.  Going on second or third dates just to make sure.  Being treated as some sort of sexual fantasy but not as a vulnerable man.  I want someone significant in my life, one person who wants  me .  An undeniable chemistry.  Is that a joke?  'Cause I don't think I'm kidding myself...I mean, I've felt it before.  And, okay, yeah: I want someone to save me...just a little bit.  I can return that favor.  I want someone to see how worth it I am and to let me see he sees it.  Someone who gets me and enjoys me.  Someone I can understand and savor.  Someone I can come home to.  Of course, considering what my life's like right now, I think it's gonna get worse before it gets better.  I've gotta sort out my housing situation, my money situation, my career situation, my incontinent dog situation...and who wants to slog through all that with me?  I don't wanna go through it and it's  my  life, how could I expect someone else to tag along for all that fun?    God, this was stupid.  I feel like a whiny 14-year-old girl.  I'm gonna have the balls to not delete this entry, but let's just pretend I didn't mention any of this.  I'm fine, really.  I'm a big boy.  If I meet someone, I meet someone...I wouldn't be the first person in the world to die alone.  Big deal.  And I just don't feel like crying right now.

       What Does It All Mean?  Today's flavor:  Dissociative Memory Swirl with Chocolate-coated Chunks of Incongruous Juxtaposition.  The guy who chased me down to give me his phone number and email address saying the we had to,  had to , go out on a date and who, against my better judgment I emailed and got in return "can you please remind me under which circumstances we met?"  Seeing a face at the MAC Pro store (on an errand for JSquared) and immediately having a block of information placed into my head: he had responded over a year ago to a personal ad I had placed, we had traded email, it had never gotten further than that, we had never met, remembering that he did indeed work as a stylist of some sort, and up popped his name:  "Are you Andrew?"  We chatted a bit, he's nice but I'm not hip enough for him, he gave me his card with home digits.  Might call.  Probably won't.  A phone call from an old and dear friend on the opposite side of the country whom I haven't spoken with in years.  I'm her oldest son's godfather.  She'll be at her family's farm in Pennsylvania the month of August and wants to drive into the City and spend time with me.  She's left three messages.  I can't call her back, much as I'd love to see and talk to her.  I'd just disappoint her with what I've become.  Chatting with Luke Perry in a back stairwell at Circle In The Square, telling him his first night will be just fine.  Gee, I'm sure he feels better now.  Waking up at 3am from some odd dream, thinking I hear someone breaking into my apartment, positive whoever it is is now running a shower.  Feeling genuinely terrified and trying to force myself back to sleep so I won't feel any pain if he decides to kill me.  Hearing three guys at the gym telling me I look great and not being able to completely understand the words because I had to try on at least three pair of shorts before I found a pair I was comfortable leaving the house in.  Looking at aisle after aisle in the Food Emporium and not finding anything appetizing except for bananas and Wheat Thins.  Holding tiny grudges about not having heard back from people then realizing with absolute clarity that, in fact,  I  hadn't returned  their  calls.  Am I cracking up?  Is it the heat?  Was it something I ate?  And what about Naomi?

       Gay As A Parade!  I am gay.  Not just gay, I'm a perfect  urlLink Kinsey 6 . I've always been gay and I've always known it, even though I didn't always have a name for it and, for awhile during adolescence, tried fervently to believe that it was just a phase.  When I hear stories about guys who didn't even know they had homosexual inclinations until their twenties, I'm baffled.  In nursery school I used to get this teensy weensy hardons (they grown since then) and I'd always run and find Danny Hall on the playground and hug him and press it against him (his response was always "quit lovin' on me" -- my guess is Danny probably has to say that often now to his cellmates)  I've never had a girlfriend, been on a real date with a woman, and I've absolutely never had sex with a woman.  I did kiss Jan Orlosky once at a pool party in junior high school (no tongue), but she turned out to be a dyke anyway, so I don't think that counts (besides, I used to fool around with her brother).  And don't start that "fags hate women" thing, 'cause I think women are fantastic, but I prefer the company of men.  Watching the parade this afternoon was thought provoking, but mostly unemotional.  Let's face it:  I've seen it all and then some.  Two things caused a catch in my throat today, one expected and one not.  The expected was, of course, the two o'clock Moment of Silence.  This raucous parade with it's bar floats blaring club anthems, Cyndi Lauper on top of a fire truck belting out her new songs, gospel choirs, the Gay Men's Chorus, marching bands...all of it stops completely at two o'clock to remember all those men and women in our lives who didn't make it to this parade.  I thought about my friend Ric, who taught me about Fosse and All About Eve; Danny, who tried to teach me, by example, not to care what the hell anyone else thinks; Tommy, who was completely insane and spastic, and a terrible actor, but would do anything,  anything  to be in the theatre; Hal, one of my first teachers in New York who cried once in class when I did a song that touched him; and, of course, my sweet  urlLink Mac .  The unexpected was just a simple tshirt, worn by a PFLAG mother marching with her son, and handwritten on the back, probably in Magic Marker, was "I'm proud to be Tom's mother!"  Call me a sap, but nobody ever said they were proud to by  my  mother, much less marched in a parade and wore the tshirt.  Made me think, hell, if I knew as early as I did -- and I don't ever remember not knowing, when I was sexually harassing Danny Hall, I was about 4 -- my mother  had  to know.  Right?  Then again, that would've meant acknowledging my existence in some way, so maybe not.  But I'm not objective, so you decide.  Ladies and Gentlemen, for Your Blog Consumption Pleasure, I Wish to Present, in a Vaguely Chronological Order, as Many Childhood Incidents of My Nascent Homosexuality (and Future Fabulosity) as I Can Recall (otherwise entitled: "Ring, Ring...Mother It's The Cluephone For You").     In nursery and kindergarten, whenever we played Lost In Space, I was always Dr. Smith.   In my School Days Memories book that goes year by year, the section entitled "What I Want To Be" has several pre-printed answers (Fireman, Astronaut, Cowboy, etc.).  These are all crossed out and in tense cursive my mother has written in "Movie Star."   In first grade I didn't have a crush on Dee Dee Cox, I just wanted to run like her.  My mother caught sight of me running with my hands up and prissy and nearly had a coronary (note to self:  do you think this would work today?).   Also in first grade, we present a sock puppet performance of "Hansel and Gretel."  I am the Witch (a character actress even then).  When constructing the sock puppet, I insist my mother use the purply-blue swirly fabric, because "no witch would be caught dead in brown."   My first parakeet I named "Pretty Boy."   In the first attempts to purchase for me the man-making bats, balls, gloves, etc., a  urlLink G.I. Joe  was purchased.  I adored him.  You pulled his dogtags and he said:  G.I. Joe, Ready For Action, Sir!"  [This is all that I'm trying to say...]   Speaking of action figures, I was also purchased some other masculine-character-building dolls:   urlLink Big Jim and Big Jeff .  They both arrived shirtless and well-defined (Jim could even pop a steel band of his arm when he flexed his bicep).  They didn't seem to have girlfriends, but they did own jointly a camper, a jet, and a racecar.  I used to wish I could become their size so I could go camping with them...be careful what you wish for...   When the Cub Scouts announced we were doing a talent show, I came up with a high-concept idea where I would be all three of the Andrews Sisters, lip-synching to my mother's old 78s, and wearing one of her altered Hattie Carnegie suits.  She seemed doubtful, so I surprised her by performing the entire thing, costume, wig and all, in the living room one night.     Every night in order to go to sleep, I had to stack as many cast albums as my record player could stand (when one finished playing, the next LP would drop), and I would fall asleep listening to My Fair Lady, The King & I, Oklahoma!, Carousel, 1776, Hello Dolly!, etc.   I loved " urlLink Funny Lady ."  Let me repeat that:  Not " urlLink Funny Girl ," " urlLink Funny Lady ."   I could then, and can still now, perform all of the songs and many of the scenes of the aforementioned "Funny Lady."  ("For once I didn't say too much, I didn't say too little, I said just enough and then I walked.")   For my mother's birthday one year, I redecorated her bathroom.   This is an ugly one, but:  Once on my grandfather's farm in Virginia, I had been helping pick potatoes (I was probably around 9 or 10).  I got tired eventually and went inside, where my father announced to the entire household that I couldn't do the work because I was "sissified."  My first thought wasn't, "hey, that's mean" it was "how did he know?"   Sophomore year in high school, I cajoled my mother into having my allergist write a note to my coach so I could be excused from Phys. Ed. all together, thus sparing me the embarrassment of being a skinny, weak, uncoordinated kid in a locker room full of jocks.  Instead, I was put in an alternate class with the school's three pregnant black girls and an asthmatic Korean, and we watched tv and learned to disco dance (even several months pregnant they helped me to perfect my bump-touchdown-turnaround-bump).   Just the fact that I  had  an allergist...   I regularly wore a pair of vintage tuxedo tails and a bowler hat to school.   I regularly wore a vintage smoking jacket at home (burgundy silk...heaven!). I could go on and on (as though I hadn't already).  However, just reading these few facts skimmed from only the surface of my memory, you can see that I  Was  most definitely what I  Was  and Some Menopausal Someone was in deep denial.  But I knew.  It's funny to me now, when guys remark on my "butchness," or even -- and this has happened several times and it never ceases to startle me -- when I'm assumed to be straight, to think back on that underweight, pale, oversized-bespectacled, clumsy, sassified, sissified, allergic, showtune-lovin' and, yes, nelly little boy.  Because that's still who I am.  I don't think I consciously created this persona to cover the other, what I think (hope) happened is that I used it all and raised  myself  to be a man.  A gay man.  A man who's got 17" biceps and all the lyrics to "Funny Lady" in his heart.

       Dude, Where's My Carpe Diem?  I should do something tonight, but I don't really feel like it.  I tried to do something last night, but I didn't really feel like it.  Why?  I don't really feel like telling you, but that would be bad blogging, wouldn't it?  Don't worry, I'm not mortally depressed again.  I'm actually feeling kinda positive (despite the fact that I live in a Canine Urine Depository).  I've upped my workouts recently and I've been eating well, so I'm feeling not-terrible about the way I look.  I slept last night.  I even slept a little late this morning.  So why am I so apathetic to this whole  urlLink weekend's activities ?  Maybe I'm kidding myself a little about feeling fine.  I still owe plenty of money.  The dog thing is stressing me out.  There are really only two pair of pants and three pair of shorts that I actually feel comfortable in.  Fortunately I can fill out a shirt well enough, but if I attended one of the  urlLink tribal dances of my people , that would require  removal  of said shirt and then I'm just another  urlLink Jell-O Jiggler .  [Of course, what should happen just as I write that last line?  JP calls me and again offers me his extra ticket to that very hootnanny.  So far I'm still resisting...]  I'm young, I'm single, I should loves to mingle.  And yet, and yet...  As I said, I thought about going out tonight.  When I got home from the gym (which I hadn't felt like going to, but forced myself into an excellent leg workout), there was an invitation from  urlLink Michael  to join him and some of his friends for a drink, but the message had come in much earlier and I needed to shower and play shepherd, etc.  But after I'd done all that busy work, I thought maybe I'd just get dressed and stroll over to Barrage and see if they landed there.  So I did.  On my way, I walked past Roseland, where the Manhunt party was taking place.  I peeked in with only a tiny feeling that I was missing something.  I even got a couple of looks from the boys on their way in, but it felt like too much work and not enough fun.  Onward to Barrage.  The closer I got, the less I actually wanted to be in there alone.  What if Michael, et.al., weren't there?  Probably there'd be someone I knew, but there'd still be awkward standing around time.  Again, too much work and not enough fun.  I didn't even have a hankering for gin.  So at 47th Street I didn't even cross Ninth Avenue.  I looked over at the bar, saw the line (a line...for a Hell's Kitchen bar...I've lived too long...) and kept on walking.  Stopped at a deli for some half and half and a  urlLink Drumstick  and headed home.  Arriving just ahead of me in the elevator were three kinda cute twentysomethings, clearly visitors to the building if not the City.  They weren't sure which floor they were going to. "Eleventh floor," I said, "1101."  They giggled.  I mean, if they weren't headed to my apartment, they had to be friends of my only gay neighbors, but they thought I was mystically intuitive.  Then the three little magpies fell silent, just standing against the walls of the elevator watching me eat my cone.  I couldn't tell if they thought I was cute, or old, or were just astounded that a gay man would be eating something caloric in public.  Finally, the cutest of them said, "There's dark chocolate at the bottom."  Sorry?  "At the bottom of the cone...dark chocolate."  The three of them were just staring at me.  "Well, now that there'd better be, or I'm gonna come looking for ya," I said.  With that the door opened on 11 and they spilled out, giggling.  Kids today.  But even though I didn't understand the exchange, it made me feel a little better.  Maybe I should force myself to go tonight, like I forced myself to go to the gym yesterday.  After all, JP's always fun.  Cyndi Lauper's performing.  A full orchestra onstage for some bizarre circuity reason.  Just because they'll be serving delicious ice cold glasses of Self Loathing doesn't mean I have to drink it, right?  It used to send me into such a tailspin, those evaluating looks where he can sum up your body fat percentage and your total net worth then leverage that against what his friends will think of him if he's caught talking to you, then the glance away.  Now rather than sending me into therapy it mostly pisses me off, but I don't wanna go to a party to get pissed off, do I?  Or maybe I can go tonight and finally learn to laugh it off.  Maybe I'll go tonight and the crowd will part and a pair of eyes will meet mine as all other sounds fall away and we walk slowly towards each other, our gaze never breaking, only the sounds of our hearts and our breathing, until we're face to face and he says, "Oh sorry, I thought you were someone else."   I could just order in some Chinese food, read blogs, watch tv.  But that sounds pathetic.  I used to be glamorous.  But what would I wear?  I could wear those yellow shorts and the new black and gold tank I bought with RJ...wait, I don't wanna go.  No, I wanna sit home alone on a muggy Saturday night in an unairconditoned apartment with a dog I'm barely speaking to.  Well, umm, no I don't wanna do that either.  I could go for a little while and see how I feel...  I don't like where this is going...I'm a goddamned house o'cards.  I don't need to seize the day, I need to get a grip.  But the yellow shorts would work...

       A Nightingale Sang In Tompkins Square  It's not always easy for me to watch other performers.  A lot of thoughts and feelings come up and I get distracted from what's happening on the stage.  Usually I start off wondering why  I  didn't get this gig, then move on to "why did he make  that  choice?" or "that's great, I would never have thought of that."  Comparing, projecting, dissecting...I think it's a lot of stuff that civilians (i.e., non-performers) don't have to deal with it.  They can just sit back and enjoy.  Me not so much.  So when I tell you that half way through  urlLink Troy's  first song, I relaxed and listened to the music and not the questions in my head, you'll know the man's good.  Really good.   urlLink RJ  and I arrived at Starlight shortly after the set began (I hate being late, but there were no cabs in Chelsea...either that, or they wouldn't stop for a boy in a too-tight soccer shirt and another with a spiky mullet) and found the back lounge packed.  It's not a typical cabaret space, the stage is far too small, but in that amount of space there were five musicians backing him up.  And Troy?  Unique.  He looks both comfortable and uncomfortable, but in charge, and the effect is charming.  His voice has lots of colors and textures and he's not afraid to mix and match.  It's ballsy and romantic and way cool.  And smart.  There was just no way for me to be jealous or critical, because I was enjoying the music,  him , so much that I got taken out of my own head for a bit.  And isn't that what, you-should-forgive-the-expression,  art  is supposed to do?    This is a really laid-back gig, with a brand new bass player just joining him last night, and it felt like being a part of that scene in the  urlLink Downbeat Club  from " urlLink A Star Is Born ."  RJ and I sat in the very back on a radiator (I think it was off...I don't have a particularly sensitive ass) and soaked it all in.  I don't wanna say too much about the set because, really, it's an experience and I can't do it justice.  Plus there are surprises.  But I will say, if  urlLink you're  reading this:  I hope you never finish that song, because it's already perfect.  We hung out a little bit after, and I finally got to meet the Man of the Hour and a Half, but we didn't get to chat because he had many more fans to greet.  So we headed out and who should I find at the bar but  urlLink Michael  and his friend Rick (although now that I think about it, I guess I'm not surprised to find either of them knocking back the vodka on a Thursday night).  We chatted for a little, but I was beginning to feel the first shimmer of sleepiness and, wanting to court that particular muse, we excused ourselves.  Since we were just around the corner, I walked RJ home (for the exact address of his apartment, please forward a photo as well as your qualifications and, after reviewing them all and not discussing them with him, I'll send it to you).  We sat on his much-blogged-about  urlLink stoop  for a bit and soaked in the East Village.  I want to live in the East Village and be groovy.  Within the span of the 40-or-so minutes that we sat there, we saw seven stretch limos (one which expelled seven fat straight Jerzey boys on a drinking tour), two identically-blond-corkscrew-tressed vaguely foreign girls (each weighing 14 pounds and looking for a bar that doesn't exist), a shirtless, muscley tattoo artist with a Lexus (through the tinted window we could see his  urlLink OnStar  glowing), an allegedly famous artist with enviable sideburns and a woman who wasn't his wife, a bickering homeless couple (the husband had inadvertantly begun dreadlocks), an ambulance which nearly collided with a cab, Puerto Rican drugdealers, the exgirlfriend of a Puerto Rican drug dealer (who wasn't particularly friendly, but then again, I guess "friendly" is what got her in trouble in the first place), and on and on.  The Big Parade of Life.  And RJ and I talked very deeply about...nothing.  Maybe he can remember what we discussed.  I do remember him telling me to breathe in the summer night (sometimes I forget to breathe), but other than that my memory is of very pleasant but very forgettable conversation. And that's... okay .    I was feeling drowsier and drowsier and I was so pleased that I might finally get a full night's sleep.  But I was enjoying being exactly where I was (again, follow the simple directions, be hot, and you can have the exact address.  Extra hot = phone number).  Also, I wasn't rushing to return to the House of Urine.  Eventually I pried my considerable ass off the stoop, walked RJ to the Brightest Deli in the World (where the poor child almost broke down sobbing because they didn't have his special  urlLink crackers ).  I staggered on to the R train, zipped uptown, did my parental duty (now I know the answer to the musical question: "Who Let The Dogs Out?"), and...and...  Oh yes:  I slept.

       A Is For Alpha  Bad day in Dogville.  I know some of you may be eating while you read this (c'mon, I eat while I read  your  blog) so I won't get too graphic, but after my carefree bike ride this morning, I returned to an apartment where floors, crate, and one particularly incontinent puppy all needed immediate hosing down.  A great part of a nutritious breakfast, indeed.  I sighed heavily, and, first-things-first, popped Dex in the tub, hopped outta my sweaty biking clothes, and gave him a good scrubbing.  Once he was nice and clean, and I was soaking wet, he pushed his way out of the bathroom and proceeded to step right back into some poop.  That's when I cracked.  I'm surprised that glass didn't shatter and the plaster remained uncracked.  I don't think he's ever seen me that angry and he boy, was wary of me for a full half hour after.  Molly, of course, stared at the wall and licked something off the floor.  Dex is an amazingly smart, but incredibly sensitive dog.  He always reacts to the current of emotion in the room and he's very tuned in to me (I do have those opposable thumbs, y'know).  And I'm aware that the honor of riding in the front car of my emotional roller coaster these past couple of months has taken a toll on him as well.  So as frustrating as it is, I've tried to be very, very patient about his recent amnesia concerning housebreaking.  He's always had a little separation anxiety anyway, and I don't think having Molly around has helped much.  Oh they enjoy each other, and play well together, but when I'm trying to give him some attention and she nudges her way in for some as well, I can just see that look in his eye, like: "Exactly who invited this dumb blond into our pack?"  I know you think I'm anthropomorphizing, but that's just 'cause you don't know him.  He's a genius.  And that's in addition to his good looks.  He spends a lot of time cocking his head back and forth trying to make sense of the stuff I say.  Much as I'm sure you do.  But I know that this housebreaking/separation anxiety issue isn't his fault, it's mine.  And other than buy  urlLink this new book  I haven't been in a frame of mine until recently to help him out.  Now we've added Molly to the mix (but only until Saturday) -- well, of course my poor boy has issues.  He is my son, after all.  All the more reason why I feel so awful about completely losing my cool this morning.  After awhile I went and sat on the floor near him and let him decide if he wanted to deal with me.  Naturally, he did.  "It's okay, Dad, you were just mad...I still love you."  In that earlier moment of madness I wondered (very much aloud) why the hell I'd ever gotten another dog and that the whole experience wasn't doing much to prove the  urlLink lower blood pressure theory , but later when we napped together and he let out a big sigh and fell asleep with his head on my chest...well, I'll clean up poop every day if I also get a little of this.  (And if any one of you bastards every mentions this precious li'l moment to me, I'll kick your ass.  And you know I can do it.)  So starting today I'm going to be a better, stronger Alpha.  We're gonna go over our commands every day, if only for a few minutes.  He's going to sit-stay before I give him his food.  He's gonna down-stay right beside me while I eat mine.  He's going to have to sit patiently until I invite him on furniture.  He's gonna wait until Alex Tribek gives the correct answer before shouting it out.  But the hardest of all, at least for me: he's probably gonna have to spend a couple of nights a week sleeping on the floor and, eventually, outside of the room.  Even though he sometimes decides that the exact center of a king-sized bed is really the only place for a 45-pound dog to sleep, I still love having him there.  I love waking up and seeing his perplexed little face hovering over mine.  I love the way the little air conditioning whore sometimes falls asleep on his back with his legs sprawled, soaking up the coolness.  But we need to set boundaries.  And if, some far off day on some distant planet, I ever  do  have another boyfriend, I want him to understand the concept of not always getting to sleep with Daddy (although at this point, practically everyone has already).  I think I can do this.  After all, it's for our mutual good.  Dogs want guidance, they want discipline.  In fact, they  need  it like they need water, and exercise, and  urlLink Snausages .  In a blanket.  Yeah,  tough love  (I really am preparing for a future boyfriend, huh?).

       Don't Be Over The Rainbow  Couldn't sleep again last night.  It's odd, I made sure I didn't have a lot of caffeine, I was certainly tired -- I could barely keep my eyes open as I read "The Latchkey Dog."  But as soon as the light was off and I tried to settle in, not-so-much with the schloffen.  It got a little uncomfortable as I turned from side to side, practicing long-forgotten breathing exercises, limited skills in meditation, etc.  Finally, again, around 5am, I nodded of.  And  up  at nine!  Depression was so much more restful, so much delicious unconsciousness.  Maybe I have an incredible credit in my Sleep Bank.  Either way, by 1pm I couldn't believe I'd gotten so much done and still had plenty of energy to burn.  Being healthy is so... healthy .  I dealt with three creditors today, all three were very understanding and helpful.  I didn't use my snotty "you work for a utilties" voice even once.  I just leveled with everyone: "Look, I wanna pay this bill, but first I have to keep from being evicted.  It really sucks and it's a little frightening, so can you help me make some payment arrangements?"  And they all did.  The scariest thing about debt for me is, not the being broke part, but the avoidance of it.  I  urlLink don't open envelopes , either, but it gives them  way  more power than they should have.  I don't balance my checkbook because it's scary to see how little I have...fuck it, let's take a good long look.  I certainly can't have any less than I think I do, and at least I'll know where I really stand (so important for a Virgo).  I also learned that the swell apartment in Brooklyn I was considering has been rented.  I never saw it, so I don't know what I lost.  But it feels like that ball is rolling, too.  I wasn't afraid to move to Brooklyn ( urlLink you know  how phobic Manhattanites can be) and to have two roommates, because it was gonna free my ass up...get me outta debt and get me working again.  The point isn't where I live anymore, the point is that I start living my way again.  I can do that anywhere.  So just to show Whomever that I'm serious, I went and bought two more moving boxes and I'm gonna start packing up some clothes, etc. (I already have a 12 boxes of books sitting in my hallway, most of the artwork is off the walls ready for packing and stuff is being sorted for my Big Estate Sale...stay tuned.)  Finding myself with extra time this afternoon, and unable to take a midafternoon nap (much to the consternation of Dex, who used to enjoy the regularly-scheduled snuggle...he practically rolled his eyes at me and moved to the loveseat where my not napping wouldn't disturb him), I took a little time to read some blogs.  A couple of them, of course,  urlLink touched on Pride  (or did in  urlLink their comments )and I found (brace yourselves) that I have strong feelings about it.  The first couple of years I was in New York I thought Pride was ridiculous.  A bunch of bad drag queens, overweight guys in leather, dykes on bikes...I couldn't relate, I found it laughable.  I was a judgmental little bastard.  Oh sure, there was some cute guys, but I wasn't gonna be associated with that whole thing just to see  them .  But I got talked into going one year with a good friend, it started on the Upper West Side that year and we watched it pass on Central Park South, and I found myself really moved.  We didn't have anything like this in Ybor City, Florida, not when I was growing up.  Oh yeah, I was embarrassed by some of it, there were still things I couldn't relate to, but by the end of that parade, I felt like I was really a part of a community.  And listening to the straight people around us, but supportive and otherwise, I realized the importance of the parade, of Gay Pride Day, to the straight world as well as to ours.  It "normalized" everything; made it all less of an issue rather than more.  The stupid straight frat boys would yell ugly remarks to the drag queens, and the dragoons would just laugh at them.  In that "be gone, you have no power here" sorta way.  Just like at Stonewall.  I don't think it changed the minds of the frat boys, necessarily, but they realized they really didn't have any power there, and they moved on...wasn't fun to taunt the men in dresses if they weren't gonna get a fight out of it.    You know who  did  get mad and yell at them?  The fifty-year-old couple that were standing near us.  They might've been  urlLink PFLAG  members, but it seemed to me they were just people who'd stumbled across a slice of the world that they didn't see all the time and enjoying it.  They responded to those guys in the embarrassed manner I have when I'm in, say, London, and I hear an American being boorish:  "We're not all like that."  Those frat boys apologized to the straight couple (who told them they should apologize to the rest of us, although they didn't) and they even stuck around a bit, with no further comment.  When we left later, I caught the woman's eye and smiled and winked at her, and she gave me a little thumbs-up.  I have to say, after being out for so many years, knowing I was gay from early childhood, and after being in the theatre for so many years, it still startles and delights me to find straight people, especially men, who have no issues with my homosexuality.  Even in the relatively enlightened era in which I grew up, straight people didn't talk about, much less accept, gay men.  It's a constant delight to me that I can be completely me all of the time and the "normal" world, the "establishment" isn't ignoring or looking the other way...they're fixing me up!  They're defending me!  But I still grew up thinking mostly it was a dirty secret.  Even now, I'm sure I have some internalized homophobia because of that.  Today I left my friend Jaymes on the corner of 54th Street and Broadway and we kissed each other on the lips, a friendly goodbye before going out separate ways.  Jaymes is 6' 1", blond, a gymnast, sweet as hell...just the type of guy I should want people to see me kissing.  I admit to you that for a split second I looked around to see who'd noticed.  What the fuck?  What do I care?  Well, really I don't.  I'm all about PDA.  But sometimes in the middle of (to pervert a phrase of  urlLink Queerscribe's ) "overtly straight space," I have a pang of discomfort.  Maybe I'm afraid I'll get fagbashed.  Maybe I'm afraid someone's gonna just smirk at me.  Or tell my mommy.  It's just a flash, never stops me from the action, but I know that feeling's there and I hope it completely goes away.    When I see baby fags on out and about, their queerness isn't that much of an issue for them, at least in the City.  And I'm so proud of them for that.  They have tv shows and movies, celebrities, politicians, and frank dialogue (ooh, that would be a good talkshow host name) to signal that this isn't some dirty secret, it's just a part of life.  Everybody's life.  It's becoming more and more normal.  And I think some of that has to do with some outrageous fags marching down the main streets of cities once a year.  And, yeah, I think it has to do with tv stations showing only the Dykes on Bikes and the more flambouyant drag queens on the evening news...it's backfired on them.  'Cause now it's not some scary, unseen threat to publicly decency and traditional family values, it's just some diesels on motorcycles and guys in dresses and so what?  The constant image is making it all the more normal.  And if the extreme is becoming a normal sight, why the hell should me holding hands with a boy on the street worry anybody?  So I guess I'm thinking the day, the parade, hasn't outlived it's usefulness.  Every year we're helping to redefine "normal" for the world.  I'm part of this evolution, and I'm proud of it. I know it ain't perfect, it's not the complete answer.  But I promise you, it's valuable to a lot of people.  And  urlLink Tinman's  right, too: Men. Heat. Shorts. Tank tops. Shirtless. Biceps. Dancing under the open sky.  Fireworks.  It's a ball...I'm celebrating with my people!  With Pride.

       The Joy of Ritual  I didn't sleep again last night.  Not exactly sure why.  The air conditioner was working nicely, Dexter was beside me, Molly was in the tub, I read until I was tired.  But Morpheus came not.  So around 5am I got up to call him on the Unisom phone.  I got his machine.  He finally got around to me, but he only had time for a short visit.  I was up by 9am, and I mean  up !  Walked the Anipals, ran some errands, biked for 45 minutes, ran some more errands.  Sweat like a...a...something that sweats a lot.  I decided it might be a good day to haul all of my Fiestaware and my Hollywood Brown Derby platter down to Mood Indigo and finally sell it all and pay some rent.  Now last week, I took this big, heavy bag downtown, after 1pm on a Tuesday which the nice man on the phone had told me was the best time, but there wasn't anyone there who would look at my stuff and I was stuck lugging around a heavy, fragile bag in the heat, pissed that I had made an effort to get some cash and was thwarted.  Today, I called first, took the R train down, unwrapped all the pieces, placed them out for unbelievable scrutiny and...guess what?  They didn't want any of it!  Nada.  Turns out,  people had actually eaten of my plates!   They scrutinized every inch of each plate and it wasn't up to their standards.  Throughout the whole thing, I wasn't angry or defensive, I just watched.  Actually, I was kind of amused.  I bought this stuff because it was fun and colorful and old and interesting, I bought it to be used, and it was.  She offered me $50 for the Brown Derby platter, but I didn't think it was enough and so I didn't sell it.  I wasn't insulted, I wasn't upset.  Yeah, I wish I could've sold it, 'cause I need the money.  But I tried and that wasn't the venue.  Okay.  Next.  I amazed myself.  I had a great workout; lifted heavy, didn’t hate my reflection, felt energized.  When I left the gym it was so nice out I decided I'd walk up to the Barnes & Noble on 66th and Broadway.  Didn’t find a thing I wanted, had a ball.  On my walk back, I realized tonight would be a perfect night for my Poverty Banishing Ritual.  I’ve been really looking forward to doing it ever since the psychic suggested it last week.  I believe in ritual.  That’s why I very much believe in commitment ceremonies and memorial services.  I certainly think writing has become a ritual for me.  Through some simple actions and event is elevated and some physical or emotional or psychic energy is transformed and things change.  Sometimes healing occurs.  So I took out my favorite Mont Blanc pen, filled it with the Bordeaux ink, and wrote.  On one piece of paper I wrote out the things that I wanted to release:  the feelings and ideas of poverty, the voices and tapes running through my head that created those attitudes, and all of my negative feelings surrounding money.  On the other, I wrote about all of the things I now wanted to embrace:  feelings of abundance and wealth, of unlimited riches both imagined and unimagined.  I put on a cd of Gregorian chant, to create a heightened sound and burned some copal incense to perfume the air and purify it.  Then I lit a new white candle and I asked all the good forces/spirits/energies in my life to attend my ritual.  I then restated what I wanted to release and, as I did, I burned that paper.  When it was completely burnt, I restated what I now wanted to draw into my life and burned that paper.  When it was gone, I remember that the psychic told me to ring a bell or bang a drum or clap my hands to disperse the energy.  So I clapped my hands three times, so loud that I startled the pups in the next room who had been, strangely enough, quite and calm while I performed by ritual.  Then I just sat in my chair, in front of the candle and drew breath.  Let the thoughts come and go.  I suppose it was a form of meditation.  I have to tell you, though you may not believe it, that I felt something going on around me.  I had goosebumps and I felt currents in the room of, I don’t know, energy.  Wow, and I’m not even from California.    After a few minutes, I got up, herded my hairy companions to the laundry room and washed some of my groovy shirts from yesterday.  It’s calm here on West 54th Street.  Dex and Molly are calm.  I’m calm.  There’s a nice breeze.  My body feels a little sore and tired, but in an  earned  way.  Just so you know I’m not completely whacked, I don’t expect a leprechaun to come prancing up with my morning coffee and a pot o’ gold.  But I’m also not gonna downplay how good it felt to do it, just so you won’t think I’m a little weird (‘cause, newsflash, I am).  I feel peaceful and optimistic and if it took a candle and some hoo-doo to get me there, so be it.  Now I’m off to perform my Peaceful Dog Sleep Ritual.  It starts with the contents of three Unisoms and a Milkbone…

       The Best Little Warehouse In Brooklyn  My legs is sore.  My back's got the misery, too.   urlLink RJ  and I did some hard labor today, but I'm here to to tell you hard labor pays off and I've got the new wardrobe to prove it.  We'd discussed making this trip for awhile (okay, a month), and finally I got an assertive email before he left for his  urlLink wallet-free weekend  and we made plans for today, deciding the first one up would call the other and firm-up a time.  Have you ever talked to RJ in the morning?  I would say monosyllabic, but that might make him sound chatty.  Me?  I've been waking up increasingly earlier and I was up and at 'em by 10am, my pack had been walked and fed and given evenly-distributed attention (by the way, anyone who tells you that it's just as easy to take care of two dogs as it is one is an evil liar and you should yank their tongue from their filthy dissembling mouths), I'd consumed my fortified grits and eggs and coffee, and chosen just the right cute-gay-but-still-gotta-walk-through-the-ghetto-to-get-there outfit.  RJ was contemplating a shower, if contemplating equals abstract flashes of water with him near it.  Finally, finally, finally we decide that we'll be uber-urban and meet on the last car of the L train (when we arrive at his stop I poke my head outta the car, if he's there he hops on, if he's not I hop off and wait...all sophisticated Gotham-dwellers are doing it).  So I quickly do a little dog proofing, make sure all the canines have a treat to occupy them, assure them that separation anxiety manifested in a form which destroys Daddy's/Uncle's cherished possessions is certain to incur the sort of wrath that will guarantee someone's a bathmat by sundown, and head out to the subway.  At the designated station I poke my head out, swivel left and write, nope, no mullet here...and hop off.  Not too long after, a vision descends the concrete stairs (cue, film noir sax):  You could feel his presence hit the platform and every head turned.  The jeans falling of his now-boyish hips, the grey FTL undergarment peeking naughtily out, the tight-fitting blue t-shirt which, with every gesture, rode up to reveal the now-in-wide-release  urlLink treasure trail  in an even sleeker package.  The too-chic-for-the-L-Train Fendi glasses only briefly hid that impish twinkle which delighted in my startled expression as I assessed the topiary formerly known as his mullet.  This boy is fabulous!  The train arrived noisily soon after, so I never got to fully hear his reducing plan, but it seemed to be based mainly on bread, vitamin water, and malicious microbes.  The subway ride was brief and painless and one wonders why the poor grouse so about this marvellous conveyance.  Once above ground, we found the neighborhood full of, as my travelling companion described them "hipsters."  We'd lose them soon enough and started off into the heat.  Now, I have to state plainly I'm not giving away the name of this Warehouse of Wonders.  I'm just not.  I'm hoping RJ feels the same, although, unnaturally enough, I have no control over his content.  I mean, if everyone knew about it -- and they've had their chance -- I wouldn't be assured of the treasures I hauled back today.  So, I'm sorry, but since I don't want nobody messin' with my booty, I'm keepin' the name of this place on the down low.  Whatever that means (I heard it on the MTV).  I always enjoy walking and talking with the RJ.  It's a nice combination of introspective self-indulgence (mostly on my part) mixed with good storytelling and off-the-wall, almost Dadaistic dialogue.  We were so into the sights and sounds of this particular part of Brooklyn (which, apparently, is a burough of Manhattan...travelling is  so  enlightening) we even managed to walk across some wet cement, thus permanently marking our outer-borough journey for the children of tomorrow.  You can see them for yourself (if you can just figure out which Miraculous Warehouse we visited and by which circuitous route).  Walking through the sparkling gates of the Oz of Outerwear, this Taj Mahal of Togs, anticipation was high and it wasn't long before we were rewarded by our first finds of the day.  Every floor held a new surprise:  An old Texaco shirt for $3?  A reversible St. Rose Basketball tank top for $2.50?  Mine and mine.  The tshirt trove was almost unbearably delicious.  If most of them hadn't been extra-large, I think my nascent friendship with RJ might have ended in an ugly tussle for the "Allergy Carnival" shirt.  My haul seemed to mostly include old mesh sports jerseys and tanks, while RJ collected kicky things that could be ripped up to make kickier things.  But when you don't need clothing to form your personality, you can get away with it.  Now legend had always had it that this Warehouse of Wearable Manna had a separate area where clothing could be bought by the pound, although one had to sift through piles for them.  We asked several of the very helpful employees (RJ to me: "You're not allowed to make fun of the Puerto Ricans and I won't make fun of the Hassids, deal?"), but there were cagey.  Oh yes they were.  The White Man coming to sift through their piles?  No way!  But finally as we cashed out (and I had added to my findings a bottle of Gulden's and a plastic meat tenderizer...mmm-hmm, there were plastic goods and other things as well at this Warehouse of Mystery and Delight) we were tipped off as to the secret entrance.  And this, children, is how RJ and yours truly, became ragpickers...  Bins and bins and bins of clothing, heaps of unwashed, unworn, unwanted clothing.  Ours for the pickin'.  We browsed through the sorted-but-unwashed section, and indeed found a couple more items, but the real riches lay in the bins.  We both knew it.  We rolled up our metaphorical sleeves and plunged in.  Tentatively at first, but soon we were as adept as the professional bargain hunters that surrounded us.  And what did we pull out?  Beaded gowns, stretchy track pants, underaged prostitute wear (RJ:  "Poor, poor tiny Jon-Benet."); oh my, that's a bra; oh dear, I don't know  what  that is.  I can honestly tell you that, while I found some tasty clothes, some all-time-new favorites for the summer, the absolute best part of it was how much we laughed.  Hard and long and, okay I'll tell it before he does, I even snorted.  Multiple snorts.  The filthy, itchy, unspeakable garments that came up in our mitts were hilarious and hideous and the best time you can have, well, with clothes on.  Frilly, pleated...cullottes?  Cut off, braided 'n' beaded Disney character tshirt (in a size a too large for li'l Heather...Mommy musta worn it, or perhaps Uncle Bruce).  Frightened we were and frightened we stayed.  There was some real excitement when the great doors to the main warehouse rolled open and a fresh (if one can use that word in regard to these musty, mite-filled  schmatas ) bin was wheeled out with several colorful matrons scuttling along behind, already picking through.  It was the Fulton Fish Market of Used Clothes.  Weakend with laughter (and, of course the heat), joints aching, and that "gotta light up" look sneaking into RJ's baby blues, we decided to call it quits.  Unfortunately, the cashier was on the other side of this Hangar of Hangdog Housedresses and we had to negotiate its minefield of unexploded and unexplored bins.  Now, I have  some  experience with addictive behavior, indeed I even once shot a commercial in Atlantic City and felt a strong pull from the nickel slots, but nothing,  nothing , compares with the nagging thought that if you just plunge your arm deep enough into the right bin you'll avoid scabies and come out the the sexiest polyblend buttondown in Christendom, the wearing of which will cure your ills and lead you to fame and personal fulfillment.  Sensible, adorable RJ pulled me in off that ledge and we staggered with our catch to The Scale.  The Guardian of The Scale was an unpleasant, scowling mistress.  My haul came to three pounds or so (roughly $7 for about seven shirts) and I handed her a $20.  She considered it, tested it with her marker, determined it to be legal tender, and pooched her lips at me, assessing my true wealth in a new light.  RJ figured most people just paid with sweaty and crumpled singles.  Back out on the street, the sunlight seemed dazzling.  The air smelled sweeter.  The mites seemed less itchy.  We were the kings of the world!  We were the champions, my friend!  We were Spartacus, goddamnit!  And we had the under $20 sacks of summer raiment to prove it.  Of course, I would've paid twice that just to spend the afternoon laughing with RJ, but he doesn't accept those kinds of cash gifts anymore.  Thank you, dear boy, for being my Sacagawea of Savings.  The very next sky blue "Pretty Girl" tennis dress I find (hopefully  without  the dried ejaculate) is all yours, even if I have to pay full price.  That's how much I care!   Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a lot of laundry to do...and perhaps a quick de-lousing for myself...

       Lie Down With Dogs  Dogs are funny little friends.  They are cute and fun.  They like to play and all they want from you is a pat on the head and a bowl of food.  Oh sure, sometimes dogs can be mischievous.  They might sneak away with one of your socks or shoes.  Or an entire night of sleep….  Last night, as you may have read elsewhere, I had an impromptu meeting with the Man of Tin.  It’s delightful now and again to be reminded over a negihamachi roll just how old and jaded I really am.  To tell the truth, I was worried I would scare him, but he seemed to take me in stride (although in all those lovely adjectives, he didn't say cute?  Why?   WHY? )  Turns out we’re just as chatty in person as we are on our blogs, although oddly enough we didn’t talk all that much about blogging.  And guess what?  The narcotic I slipped into his miso soup worked and I got him to agree to let me send out his resume with some cover letters to jobs I think he'd be right for.  Bwahahahahaha...he has no idea how drunk with power I am and what poor choices I'll make.   Anyway, we finished up our cheap sushi and I initiated the young one into the ways of Midtown Homosexual Drinking Establishments.   We got to Barrage around 11:30pm, plenty of time for most showfags to be out and about, but we walked the length of the place and I knew no one. NO ONE.   Inconceivable!   I began to suffer from AWDS (Attention Whore Deficit Syndrome).  A gin & tonic only helped mildly.  Soon, though, people I knew, had done, and/or had nearly done trooped in and we started our sophisticated banter centered around this business we call shoe ("Ba ba da wonderful! Ba ba da marvellous! Margo was just ba da!").  I noticed a glazed look coming over the Boy Wonder’s eyes…we were losing the Tinster (you mean not everyone’s interested in the comings and goings of Reba McIntyre’s standby?), so I thought I’d play Dolly Levi which I think was more successful than he does (I mean, you were out at a fashionable midtown bar chatting in a relaxed manner with a cute boy…I think it’s progress) even though he didn't get none.  I'm here to report that the Tinman was charming, was able to initiate and sustain conversation, looked perfectly adorable in his ringer-tee...he won't be single long boys.  Apply via my email, I'll be pimping, uh, screening all applicants.    Meanwhile on the other side of the bar, I ran into old friends and some of  their  old friends who were, ever so  friendly .  But I was fading and after some close calls (I am not quite ready to romp in Cupid’s grove), I excused myself to go home, walk the dog and our doggy guest and get to bed so I could be fresh in the morning for my volunteering duties at Broadway Bares.  The dogs had a different idea.  Dexter, as I may have mentioned, has never had a sleepover friend (for that matter, it’s been awhile since I have).  Dex usually sleeps right next to me.  Molly usually sleeps right next to her dad.  So there was some confusion as to who would be sleeping in bed.  It didn't exactly get ugly, in fact it was almost too polite.  One would hop up and the other would pace around the bed ( click, jangle, click, jangle, click, jangle ).  Then the other would hop up and the first would hop off and pace around the bed ( click, jangle, click, jangle, click, jangle ).  They tussled playfully with each other for awhile, both finally settling on the floor, then the bed.  Just as I’d fall asleep, there’d be some disturbance in the sleeping arrangements and we’d begin the process all over again, with minor variations (but with the same  click, jangle, click, jangle, click, jangle ).  Then it started to rain.  Molly doesn’t like rain nor thunder.  She panics and the only place she feels comfortable is in the bathtub.  So finally, around 5am, it was all resolved, with one dog by me on the bed and one dog tucked safely in the bathtub.  I thought of taking one of Molly's tranquilizers, but I was out the second I got back to my one-dog bed.  Needless to say I slept through my alarm and when I woke up two hours later than the time I was to be at Roseland, I was too tired (and too embarrassed) to actually go in.    There was a lot of activity in the City today:  The Pride Rally, Folsom Street East, etc.  But I wanted a mellower, mildly dog-free day, so instead I bummed around with a pal.  Lunch at California Pizza Oven (Chicken California pizza with grilled chicken, spinach, whole cloves of garlic, and ricotta cheese), Kmart (they had none of the things I needed, but my pal did parade me down every single Martha Stewart aisle the had…I’m suspecting a hint of mint), the Strand (bought "The Latchkey Dog" so I can be an even better dad), then home for a nap and of course, dogwalking.  You might have noticed I don't really have anything to blog about.  I don't really.  I'm stalling...yup, that's what I'm doing.  Stalling.  Sooner or later, though, I'm gonna have to walk into that arena I used to call a bedroom and steel myself for that ol' familar tune:   click, jangle, click, jangle, click, jangle .  Cave canem, ya'll...

       Call Me Mowgli  It's hot as hell in my apartment.  Tropical rainforest hot.  Steamy with no air moving and I'm pretty sure it's gonna rain in the foyer any sec.  Muggy, I tell ya.  Sure I have a fan going, but the heat laughs at my fan.  There's an air conditioner in the bedroom, but I can only afford to run it at night.  And so sweat is pouring from every pore, my clothes are drenched; most of the day I've run around the apartment in soaked boxers.  I, perhaps foolishly, agreed to babysit my friend Quinn's golden retriever, Molly.  Quinn's going off to Copenhagen for a week and Molly has, umm...special needs.  Okay, she's completely neurotic.  She can't stay in a kennel because, if there's a thunderstorm, she'll try to dig her way out of her crate until she has bloody stumps.  What Molly needs during a thunderstorm is the security of being in a bathtub, where she can hide from that bad noise.  She's sweet, she's just not smart.  Meanwhile, Dexter has never had another dog in the house.  He loves other dogs.  Other dog owners see us coming to the dog run and they know they're dog's gonna sleep like a rock that night, 'cause Dex is gonna run 'em ragged.  So imagine, if you will, Dex's utterly perplexed yet delighted face when Molly showed up today.  It's much like my face when the nice man from Domino's show's up.  Delicious.  Dexter's a year old, Molly's six...but she's game and they're having a great time.  All. Over. The. Apartment.  Oh, they take breaks...sometimes to drink water and slobber it all over the apartment, sometimes just to sit on something I was planning on wearing and pant.  But then they rally and the rollicking fun continues.  All. Over. The. Apartment.  I've already placed a moratorium on anything squeaky, but it's still a little crazy up in here.  I'm really being very calm considering I'm soaked through, moderately covered in fur and the only intelligent thing I've said all day to another living creature is, "OffDropitSitNoOffLeaveit."  Tomorrow I'm volunteering all day at Broadway Bares/Equity Fights AIDS helping to set up Roseland for Broadway Bares.  It's gonna be a long, long day of hauling heavy equipment, moving chairs and banquettes, tedious filling of goodie bags, etc.  Not only is it for a good cause, but: (a) Roseland's completely air conditioned, and (2) no dogs allowed.

       The Mirror Has Two Homos  (And One Of 'Em's Pissed)   Biking along the river today, I passed a blader coming the other way who looked at me quizzically.  It wasn't cruisy at all, just odd.  And I realized that my forehead was all scrunched up, my eyes were narrowed.  I was having a perfectly nice ride, mind you, but I must've looked like I was in pain, or totally pissed off.  Might've been from the sun, I was wearing my glasses so the sun was hitting me pretty directly, might've just been concentrating, who knows?  I relaxed my face, and tried to notice when it was tensing up again.  I biked on for a bit, wondering what that blader must've thought was going on with me, according to my face, and for the gazillionth time in my life, I wished that I could be outside of my body to see myself objectively.  I think we should, as humans, have the option of doing that a few times in our lives.  Be able to step outside of our bodies and observe ourselves as a separate living thing, the way others do.  Say once every decade, plus a couple of emergency viewings during times of stress.  And not just to see ourselves, we should be able to have a little unsuspecting conversation with ourselves, to see how we sound, how we come off.  Imagine the perspective we'd get on ourselves in our teens, our twenties, if we could watch ourselves from across the room, interacting with friends and strangers, then walk across the room and strike up our own dialogue.  Of course, my reaction would totally depend on the packaging of Observer Me.  Would I be my type so that I'd flirt with myself?  Would I be unappealing and a little too inquisitive so I'd get my own hackles up?  Let's face it, sometimes the soup du jour has a little more spice and sometimes a little more cheese and how would I know what I was ladling out at the moment and if it was really representative of me?  It's a little like that Secret Shopper they used to send around when I worked in the gourmet section (read: glorified deli) at Bloomingdale's.  The idea was that you'd never know when the Secret Shopper was coming by to grade you, so you'd be pleasant to  all  the customers.  Well, c'mon, we were weighing overpriced goatcheese and slicing imported bunderfleisch for 60-year-old East Side Matrons who'd each wave her deli-number at you clutched in her Bulgaried hand, demanding that she see the first slice to make sure it was thin enough, then snatch it off the waxpaper pop it into her professionally-stretched maw and say "Oh Bloomie's can afford it."  I guess, lady, but so can you.  If you were really worried about saving money, I think you be getting your saucisson at Smiler's instead.  About the fifteenth time through that particular exercise in one day and you tend to get a little testy (Matron: "Young man, I'd like some tongue"  Me: "Sorry lady, I get dinner and a show first").  There were also fun celebrity customers (one who always asked for me was Mrs. Thurston Howell, III, who loved me because I knew her name was Natalie Schaeffer and that she'd been in a Gracie Fields movie called "Molly and Me"), but you could be pretty sure that, no matter how low their careers, Liza and Olivia de Havilland had not yet stooped to being Secret Shoppers.  Umm, where was I?  Oh yeah, Observer Me being like a Secret Shopper.  I don't think I'd be chipper and charming all the time on the off chance that Observer Me might be the droning, judgmental little twinkie serving me drinks.  Although it  might  be fun to be told off by me (I suppose there are plenty still living that I might ask...), still what if I caught me on an off day?  Okay, so it's not a perfect system.  But how else am I supposed to really see if I'm sexy or not on a dance floor?  Or if I  really do  look fat in these pants?  Or if my devilish smile is really just satanic?  What am I supposed to do, trust others?  As if, pal.  Observer Me could check it all out and get back to me based on my own taste, and in a language I understand.  Y'know, like "I wouldn't wear those cowboy boots anymore, baby, they make you walk like Verna Spurlock from ninth grade."  Got that loud and clear -- those heels make me prissy.  Someone else can't reach me as quickly and truly.  My doctor says I have "bigorexia," that no matter how much I work out I never look big enough to me.  Observer Me could just say, "Your arms aren't as big as Trainer Bob's, but they're bigger than Allen's and  I'd  do me."  See?  I know  right  where I fall in that comparison (and, frankly, I wish they  were  as big as Trainer Bob's, but that's a whole 'nother blog).  Maybe it's obsessive.  Probably it's just gay (really, do straight boys want to chat with themselves?  I think not.).  And I suppose I should spend a lot more time being the "best me I can be," but, can you even read that sentence without your eyes rolling so far back in your head you can see yesterday?  Yeah, me either.  My "Observer Me" method's a whole lot better, but I'm not God.  Yet.  So I'll have to depend on the kindness of sistahs, and the fallibility of reflective surfaces, and the faces of passing bladers to mirror back to me what I hope I'm putting out, process it all and believe what feels right.  I guess.  Having said that,   Do I look fat in this?

       I Can See Clearly Now  I went to a psychic today.  She was recommended to me an amazing new force in my life.  I knew I wanted to talk to someone about all the weirdness going on in my life, all of the strange coincidences and quirky manifestations that have been taking place recently.  I wanted to get a different perspective, a higher perspective.  I wanted to make sense of all the little patterns in the ground and find out if they were all part of  urlLink something larger .  I went to the right place.  Her studio in the West 30s was calm and white, with Chinese temple incense burning.  We sat facing each other in folding chairs by a huge window.  She turned on the tape recorder, so I could listen to it all later, started with a prayer and began:  "You are a soul of great power.  That is without question.  The question is how do you choose to use your power?"  What a way to start the session!  Wow.  That was worth the money right there.  She went on to discuss that the choice of using my power referred not only to myself, both inward and outward, but also to my interaction with and bearing on the world.  The image was given to me of a tree.  I was encouraged to think of myself as a powerful, old oak tree.  It's strength doesn't come from it's outward activities, but from it's stillness and longevity.  A tree doesn't need to demonstrate its strength it just  is .  And the longer it  is , the stronger and deeper its roots grow.  She was being guided to show me this as a symbol of the ancient energies which comprise who I am now, to give me that image to focus on, to center myself.  Also, she described a recent wanderlust, a feeling that I needed to move somewhere to regain my strength, and thus the image of this tree, growing strong exactly where it is.    She talked about all the lives I've lived in just these 38 years.  Interesting, since I know I've struggled, but not comparatively.  But then she started to talk about other lives, past ones, and that fascinated me.  She again described my soul as "ancient."  She spoke of several lives in Africa, one in particular where I was a healer.  In that life I used magic and bones to bring about the healing that I did.  The bones were ornamental but also spiritual.   "Don't be surprised if, in this life, you become attracted to bones, and collect them in your house."   Well, my friends, I do love the bones.  I've had over the years a couple of silver skull earrings (one had a moveable jaw which I adored) and, just this past New Year's Eve, I bought a silver necklace of small skulls to wear for the changing of the year.  I also have a few other skull/boney things in my house.  This lady's good.  She also told me that I'd had lives on the water and by the water, working on ships, and one particular life in Hawaii.  A spiritual connection to the ocean and the islands.  I've never been to Hawaii (I'm waiting for  urlLink someone  to take me), but being on or near the ocean has always been really nourishing to me.  Growing up near the Gulf of Mexico, that calm, flat water didn't really interest me.  But when I finally saw the wild ocean...I could've stared at it for days.  And when I've worked on ships, especially crossing the Atlantic, I'd always be drawn out to the decks at night, always with an old, familiar feeling of calmness near, yet enormous respect for, the vastness of the ocean.  Maybe this is true for everyone, but whenever I'm troubled, I always take a long walk by whatever body of water is closest and work things out.  Now that I think of it, my bike rides of late are never in the park are they?  The park's just a couple of blocks away.  Nope, I need to ride by the river.  "So you have in past life, more than once, been in a position of authority, been in a leadership role, been a king.  And the feeling here is...so you're in this incarnation now and something in you has great expectations, 'cause you've done great things before, and when those expectations aren't met quickly, part of you gets disappointed quickly, you're expectations are dashed, and then your emotions may sink or dive."  Gosh, don't we all wanna hear this?  I always felt I was Anne of Cleves.  But seriously, folks...  It makes sense to me.  I almost always end up in charge.  I almost always make the decisions.  And I almost always grow impatient when the results don't match my expectations.  Then again, maybe she was calling me a control queen.  Hey, stop laughing or I'll send you to  urlLink The Tower .   She talked of one more past life, a life in the desert, where I and two others "got rid of" someone.  I walked away from it clean and, in fact, prospered as a merchant in that lifetime.  However I carried that with me throughout that life and have some of it with me in this life.  The lesson, it seems, is that when these ethical/moral questions come up in this life, I really only need to come clean to myself.  I don't need to broadcast or discuss it, as long as I'm honest with myself.  Then I can move on and be free.  All I can tell you is that it makes sense to me.  The smallest example of this is, if I go into a store and browse but don't buy anything, I always think I'm going to be accused of shoplifting.  Odd, huh?  Does anybody else every have that feeling?  Anyway, that echoes throughout my life and it's interesting to have it brought up to me in this way.  We then began to focus on now:  "The summer's pretty hectic, it's pretty whacky.  There's a lot of, umm, energy that's kind of churning, and moving, and changing.  September.  We come to September, and here we find some solidity and, um, a real positive vibration.  I find you standing in September and some, actually a good bit of the static and just sort of chaotic energy that surrounds you has settled down."  Hallelujah, Sister!  Also in September, my focus on basic, day-to-day activity begins to really pay off.  I'm assuming that means attending to the details of daily life and trusting in that simplicity, rather than being overwhelmed by it and doing nothing.  She felt that these daily mundane tasks would also help make me stronger physically.  Again, makes sense to me.  December, she told me, will be blue skies and smooth sailing.  Perhaps literally.  Also she saw me engaged in the thing that I want to be doing, a great feeling of "flow."  Beyond that, she saw me, in 2002, engaged in very intense periods of work, followed by a passage of time where there was a lapse between projects, where things are calm.  Sounds like an acting career, no?  The work that she sees coming will be based on my growing knowledge of myself, as determined by myself, rather than my previous identity that I allowed to be defined by others.  She saw me connected with California (can anyone say Blogstalker!  The Series?), and also connections travelling across the country before reaching California, perhaps around Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada.   "There're some people in there that you connect with...that proves significant for you."    A lot of this reading kept coming back to centering and grounding myself, and how everything good for me would flow from that.  To be almost stubbornly centered.  And that the karma for money to flow into my life, a great deal of money, was in place, but that (a) I need to persevere and (b) that the source of all that money would be unexpected.  Sounds promising.  A very surprising thing she told me was that I should give myself time, even though I feel that I don't have enough time -- that's a myth I've created for myself.  All the areas I want to branch out into, all the things I want to accomplish, might take time, but I have plenty of it.  It's not that I feel old at 38, but I do feel that I've wasted so much time and how much longer will I actually have to get done what I want to get done.  Time is on my side and I shouldn't be in a hurry.  Remember that the next time I'm late to meet you...  Sitting opposite me, with her eyes closed, and with a very palpable energy flowing between us, she know lifts up one hand and moves the other over the flattened palm, miming writing:  There might be some writing....I'm impressed with some creative activity, and some of it is, like, fledgling work.  And just give it time, give it time, let it grow.  It will."  "I feel something really interesting is gonna happen to you this summer.  But it really has to do with your relationship to yourself.  It's very interesting, it has to do with umm, kind of a shadow falling away.  I feel it has to do with you overcoming a fear.  Letting go of some part of your past.  And I feel it's gonna happen through the people that walk into your life...it's kind of a wake up!"    Guess that would be you, kids.  At this point, she opened the session up and I asked about my money issues.  I said that, oddly enough, I could manifest other things in my life, but the money thing had become more and more illusive and frustrating.  She asked if I felt that I was really manifesting the "other" stuff, and I said I did.  "Well," she said, "you're the magician, so you're creating both.  Let me ask you, what kind of attitude did you grow up with surrounding money."  And, of course, I saw it.  Or heard, it really.  My mother's voice:  "You're no good at handling money and that's why you'll never have any."  I mean, jeez...how had I forgotten  that ?   "That history is really catching up to you, you need to release that.  You need to go to the library and get a book on banishing rituals and really do a ritual in your apartment.  Banish the whole poverty mentality.  And you can do it, you've done it in other lives, you can do it in this one."  While I'm sure there's a lot of eyerolling in Blogdom right now, this actually felt/feels very, very right to me.  I don't think I'm gonna light a candle, clap my hands and wake up on a big pile of money.  But I think it'll definitely signal to myself and the Universe that I'm done with those voices, I'm done being poor, and serve as a reminder to retrain my thinking.  She referred me to  urlLink Barbara Biziou , the ritual guru, who lives in New York.  But whether I go to the guru or just get her book and do it myself, this is something that makes a lot of sense to me.  After all, my  urlLink pool dream  changed my perspective, why shouldn't this?   We talked about more practical ways to manifest this as well, by not engaging in a poverty mentality.  Everyone talks about how broke they are, etc.  She suggested that I don't talk about money at all for awhile, with anyone, and I'm going to work at that.  Also I'm to visualize myself with lots of money, taking care of my needs, having fun with it, taking care of friends...drawing in a prosperous mentality.  I'll let you know what happens.  Maybe I'll buy you something pretty...  We talked about a few other things, my career, my relationships, but it all really came back to getting this poverty mentality out of my head.  The paths would begin to clear to everything else.  I could run into someone on the street who invites me to grab a bite with them.  Today I probably wouldn't go...no cash.  But if I get rid of that condition, I might say yes to dinner and who knows where that path would lead?  While I write this, I realize that the concrete issue of the poverty mentality has bled into all the crevices of my life, creating poverty of creativity, of spirit.  I have some steps I can take that make sense to me now, a way to begin to clear that debris from my path.  Maybe it seems simplistic for you, but to those of us who overcomplicate their worlds, it's a blessing.  I felt my energy change in that room.  She remarked on it, too.  I feel clearer on some things, and hopeful about all of it and I can't wait to get started.  Now things are gonna get  really  interesting...

       Dear Robbo  I know you're out on the Island this week, and I probably won't send this to you anyway, but I had to let you know I was thinking about you.  I've been biking just about every morning down the Hudson, trying to shed some of this weight that I know you wouldn't approve of, but also 'cause it feels fucking great.  My body's moving, the wind is nice, I've gotten great color...   Any way, I decided that some tunes might make the ride even better, so I dug through a bag of old tapes and found some of those dance music tapes you used to make for us.  Remember?  That was before Mikey, when you used to like dance music with lyrics (don't worry, I ever say that out loud at the Pavilion or Raymond Dragon...it would ruin your rep).  So I found this tape with your handwriting on the label "Fabulation III" and I pop it in the Walkman and head off.  Wow.  I mean every single song made me think of you!  It's funny that I associate you with just about all of mid-90s Happy House.  I guess Tommy was right, we really  did  go out every single weekend.  No wonder people used to ask us that infuriating question:  "Are you two together?"  I still laugh about that time in Ptown when we marched back to the porch of that guesthouse to correct the boys sitting out there.  And that stewardess for British Air at Heathrow that asked if we were twins.  We even acquired the same laugh.  So...the tape.  Here's some of what was on it:  M People "Renaissance (I'm Coming Home)" -- The night M People played the Palladium, probably my second time ever taking E (which we still called X).  We danced up close to the stage all night long so we'd have a good spot when they finally came on.  And me, not a big concert goer, but rolling so nicely that I was actually waving my hands in the air and singing along every time they got to the phrase "to your house" and trying to get you to join me.  Heather Smalls even grabbed my hand at one point and you were SO impressed.  That was also the night that, coming down the main stairs, we got to the bottom and both decided that the lights inset in each step were WAY too fabulous and Dreamgirls and we ran up the stairs so we could walk down them again, but slower.  When we left we walked uptown, feeling the breeze and not talking, until somewhere around Madison Square Park I asked aloud, "Was I really waving my hand in the air shouting 'to your house?'" and we both fell on the sidewalk laughing.  "Sky High" -- I have no idea who remixed this. We were in London, staying at that ratty President Hotel, coming home every morning with the sun (watching the cruisers in Russell Square having a good wank) and up a couple of hours later for our English breakfast and out to sight-see.  God, we planned that trip  so well , and everyone thought we were so anal (okay, maybe we were).  But we got a lot done during the day and partied every night.  So we walked into G.A.Y., onto the second floor, getting our bearings, and you're talking to me about how the space reminded you of Octagon and isn't that guy over there staying at our hotel and all I can hear coming from every speaker is  "You, you've blown it all sky high, by telling me a lie..."  and I interrupt you with "Blah, blah, blah MUST DANCE!" and we race downstairs to the dance floor, laughing and getting strange looks from the Brits.  That's the night you met Adam Heath who "tasted of apples" (you hoped I'd forgotten that, right?).  "Not Enough Love" -- God, I'd just broken up with That Bartender.  I felt so free.  We were somewhere odd, maybe Twilo?, Susan was spinning.  I heard this song and couldn't get it out of my head.  Sang it on the subway.  Sang it at dinner.  You commented, "It makes you feel sassy, doesn't it?" And everytime we'd hear it, we'd find each other and make the sassy face.  Which reminds me of our dancefloor sign language, of which I can, at the moment, only recall the symbol for "You Can't Leave With Him, He'll Take You Home, Cut Off Your Head And Boil It In A Pot."    "A Perfect Day" -- I think this song came out the last time we all went to Provincetown as a family.  We had that bonfire on Race Point, we were there for sunset and, being a Virgo, I made sure it was the first night of the full moon so it rose up over us big and white.  We'd spent the day at Herring Cove, you and Tommy through ice at me to keep from singing along with the cast album of "Applause" that a local radio station was airing.  All of us nicely browned from the sun, in our matching sweatshirts with our big initials on them, mellowed out after burgers and s'mores, leaning back in the cool sand all in a pile with our backs against those logs, the fire blazing and listening to the lyrics:  "Such a perfect day, I'm glad I spent it with you."   And speaking of lyrics and Ptown, I almost fell off my bike when I heard this next one:  "These Sounds Twirling"  -- Must've been our first summer up there.  Out on the dance floor of the A-House.  Probably mildly twisted.  We actually thought (okay, I probably planted the seed) that the lyrics were  "Ptown boogie all the tiiiiiiiime."   It made us sooo happy!  Every time it came on we'd lose our minds just a little more.  I'm glad no one told us, until That Bartender's evil co-worker said, "you boys know the lyrics are really "these sounds twirling through my miiiiiiind."  We pretended not to be embarrassed.  And everytime that song came on after that, we still sang our version defiantly...and laughed.  M People (again) "Open Up Your Heart" -- This must've been our first White Party.  You'd just broken up with Scott, I'd just broken up with Peter, we were young, we were single, we were wearing white, and  man , did we think we were cool.  Eddie and Ricardo were in from Boston, Tommy was still going out dancing with us.  I don't think we left the floor for four hours.  But when this came one we came from our various activities and corners of the dance floor like white blood cells and clumped together in a big hug fest until it was all over.  Seems like so long ago, but it's really only about six years.  I guess I could just keep going, but none of it's funny to anyone but us.  Funny how I've missed you for the past couple of years, even though I still see you.  I still see or hear something that makes me wanna call you at work and tell you, but I don't have your work number memorized any more.  Probably you'd be busy, anyway, you're busy a lot these days.  Or you'll tell me about who's in your house, who you and Mikey "did" this weekend, how twisted you got.  I guess I'm a little bitter about the fact that Mikey's taken you away from us and into that whole Professional Chelsea Boy thing.  Not that I'm judging.  Much.  To be fair, some of those things that seemed so important to us then have changed as much for me as they have for you.  And of course I still love you, you were my brother, my  sistah .  I wonder sometimes if you think of all of the gut-wrenching laughter we used to induce in each other; and if you do, do you smile or does it embarrass you?  'Cause it makes me smile, like it did today.  Okay, one more (I can't resist).  How 'bout: "United We Stand" -- A couple of years ago, Pier Dance.  Hadn't really seen you all day, I was dancing/babysitting Davey and Grandma, Ray and Tom, B & J were there, too.  Tommy had just flown in from Atlanta and had the cab take him right there.  You were dancing with Mikey and some of his (I guess  your ) friends a few feet away.  Then this song comes on and I've got my eyes closed, feelin' the words, feelin' the bass, feelin' the breeze.  I open my eyes and through the crowd I see you smiling at me.  Our arms go up at the same time and our hands clasp tightly, above the swaying bodies.  I laugh and so do you.  We sing the words at each other, even though we can't make out each other's voices over the noise.    "United we stand, divided we fall,  And if our backs should ever be against the wall,  We'll be together Together, you and I"   Our hands hold tight together as long as they can, but finally the sweat and the bodies pull us apart.  But I still see you across the crowd in that summer twilight, smiling back at me.  Aww, hell...I'm gonna go play ABBA's "Thank You For The Music" on your answering machine...

       Pride (A Deeper Love)  I seem to be absenting myself from all of our Pride doings this year.  Usually I love the whole thing: the parade with friends, brunchy something after, the Pier Dance, the fireworks with the appropriately maudlin music, going to one of our apartments for showering/changing, and then some after party to dance until the next afternoon.  I love being with my friends, the altered states, the sweaty dancing.  I even love the moment of silence at 2pm so I can remember all those amazing, vibrant souls that I still carry around inside of me.  But this year I don't have much interest.  It's true that I don't feel like I'm in the best shape and there's an awful lot of flesh to be bared.  And it's true that that damn Pier Dance was so damned crowded last year because of the counterfeit tickets (which they say has been solved this year).  It's true my little band of brothers has, well, dissipated through bad marriages, new jobs, and sobriety.  But I think there's something else.  I think it's ceased to be fun.  Or maybe  I've  ceased to be fun.  I've been asked to march with the nice folks of VaxGen, the AIDS vaccine trials that I take part in, but I've marched other years and I'd really rather watch (this only refers to parades, you pervs).  JP bought a ticket to the big Caligula party and he wants me to go, but do I want to?  I will not be ingesting the requisite chemicals so I won't be on the same wavelength (and I'm all about wavelength), have no interest in facing the Body Fasciti so I probably won't be ingesting the requisite boys, I haven't heard a lyric on the dance floor in NYC for quite some time, so dancing won't be so groovy (I like to mouth lyrics and act them out), and while I love hanging out with JP, he'll be on some boy within the hour and I'll be dancing next to them like a maiden aunt.    If there were a big, warm, fun group going out, if it was still just about that, I think I'd be there.  Or maybe if I was all partnered up I'd have someone to enjoy it with.  Ah, that's it, isn't it?  It's not that I'm not fun, this Pride thing (actually the whole going out/pseudo circuit thing) is, for me, a group activity, a family vacation.  I want to be a part of that group again, to spend time with people because we just adore each other, not as a waystation to the next boy/drug/event.  Blogging brings me clarity once again.  I might go 'round to the parade, maybe take Dex (see if we can't kick in his alleged Boy Magnet once and for all).  But I've been invited out to the Pines to my friends' house and I'm thinking that's the way to go.  All the self-respecting homos with agendas will be partying their asses off in Manhattan and I can enjoy the beach without having to suck it in for asthetic purposes.  And I'll remember my folks on a wide expanse of deserted beach...they'll probably like that.  This year, maybe I'll even include everyone who's gone from my life but still alive.  Maybe I'll even forgive a few of 'em.  I guess this is all part of my recent life upheaval/transformation.  It doesn't freak me out, or even bum me out.  LIke everything else in my life right now, it's like a curious stone that I'm picking up and turning over; examining.  Some of them I'll put in my pocket and some of them I'll skip out over the water.  I guess this year Pride (but not  pride ) gets skipped...wonder if they'll miss me?

       Boozy Ol' Showgirl  My Gawd,  dahlings , what a weekend.  Shows and booze, booze and shows.  But no boys.  On Friday night, I embarked on an East Village pub crawl with  urlLink Michael , a fellow blogger, and his sexy friend Rick (not Nick, who's apparently someone else).  We had a quick drink at Rick's East Village pad where we tried to sort out the weather patterns of Auckland (to no avail), then headed out to WonderBar.  It was far too crowded and full of undesirables, so we decided to try Starlight.  Also, too crowded.  We ended up settling at the Phoenix.  I like the Phoenix.  It's low maintenance and there's a good jukebox.  Michael was beginning to fade and I had promised to meet JSquared at The Cock, so I bid Michael and Rick goodbye.  The Cock was fairly crowded and JSquared was already at work on his Mandarin and 7-Up (the 21st Century's replacement for a Sloe Gin Fizz, in my opinion).  I was at work on my third Citron & Tonic.  We chatted with friends, browsed the lounge in the back, downed another drink or two, and headed home.  Saturday afternoon, I was invited to the matinee of " urlLink Bells Are Ringing " before its closing on Sunday.  I'm so glad I did.  Faith Prince is just a Big Broadway Star.  There's no one like her.  She's fun, funny, quirky and she can break your heart with one bat of those luscious lashes.  I've always been in love with her.  After her big  urlLink Eleven O'clock Number  "I'm Goin' Back" the applause was so extended and exhuberant that they couldn't get the show restarted for about 10 minutes.  Faith was so moved.  I was sitting close enough to see her on the verge of tears, it's been such an emotional journey for her, and a few minutes into this ovation, Beth Fowler, who was standing behind Faith onstage, stepped a little closer to her and put her hand on the small of Faith's back to steady her.  "Bells" is a terrific show and, even with its problems, deserved a longer, happier run than this.  But I was glad I got to see it.  I sat with JP and his mother and step-father and, at intermission, while we were stretching our legs, I spotted my stalker sitting a few rows behind us, all the way house left.  Yes, the Blogstalker has a stalker of his own.  Well, had.  Has.  Whatever.  I haven't talked about him much, nor will I now, but it's always disconcerting to see him (though he no longer approaches me, having learned the hard way what a bad idea that really is).  Saturday night, my old friend from LA (Peter and I shared him in the divorce), Rupert (a noted television writer), wanted to see our newest watering hole,  urlLink XL .  I'm not a huge fan of Chelsea bars anymore, but I still adore Chelsea alcohol.  And there is something kinda  urlLink Logan's Run  about XL (even if I end up feeling like  urlLink Peter Ustinov  rather than  urlLink  Michael York).  At any rate, I let Rupert take in the ever-changing wall colors, the toothsome (if hairless) bartenders, and even the fish in the bathroom.  But after a couple of drinks we longed for the sight of real men and decided to wend our way to, yes, the East Village.  Rupert, being an Angelino, insisted we hop in a cab, so we ended up at the Boiler Room a little too early.  The good news was there was a clear path to the bar.  My favorite bartender, a long-haired biker daddy wasn't working, but I drank just the same.  Rupert had a hankering to visit a skanky bar we'd been to a few years ago that I was positive had closed but for which he'd seen a recent advertisement, a placed called I.C.Guys.  I remember it being about as big as my bathroom, where they served only beer in cans and every few minutes a barely-legal wisp of a boy would hop on a crate in baggy  urlLink Underoos  and do a desultory little dance.  Not of it appealed (especially the no-vodka policy) but one must occasionally cater to one's out-of-town guests.  Mercifully, I.C.Guys is C.L.Osed, so we continued on to WonderBar.  This time it wasn't too packed, the music was good, and so we stayed for a drink.  Well, actually I drank, Rupert was switching to bottled water, which concerned me mightily, as you might imagine.  It seems Rupert had accidentally ingested some sort of happiness-inducing tablet (I forget what he called  urlLink it ).  It made me wanna drink more.  So I did.  Off, off, off we were to our next stop, Starlight, a mellower, loungy lounge.  I ran into a group of friends, including Alberto and his boyfriend Mark.  We chatted, I drank, and Rupert began to kick in.  I have to say, I was a little jealous.  Jealousy, of course, makes me thirsty.    Now, Rupert, having grown up in Indiana and now living in Los Angeles, has a fascination for Brooklyn boys.  Dark haired, beefy, Brooklyn-accent and, preferably chewing gum with his mouth open.  He found one in Starlight, but soon found him dull and requested that we press on.  I said goodnight to my friends and wove our way to the Phoenix.  Have I mentioned I like the Phoenix?  Well, I do.  The bartender tonight was a former co-worker of a bartender that I dated for awhile when they both were slinging gin over to the Barracuda, so we got our first round free.  Yes, he gave us two Citron & Tonics.  What's that you say?  You're absolutely right, Rupert  is  only drinking water.  Well, I guess I'll just down these myself.  There was lots to look at in this bar.  One very cute boy who kept walking slowly by us was especially cute and, I thought, interested in Rupert.  But the minute Rup went downstairs to the bathroom, the boy came over and introduced himself to me.  Adrian.  Yo.  Shorter than me, pretty dark bluish-green eyes, nice hair, tight body, but I could tell it was doomed from the start.  Adrian is a musician, writes, sings, plays.  But not in front of people, not yet.  Instead he runs a hair salon.  Why, I ask, are gay men so predictable?  Adrian, as it turns out, is also 24.  Run Logan5...the Old Man will only try to drag you to the City of Domes!  We chatted for a bit and, to his credit, didn't just give the standard, "I've gotta run to the bathroom" line, but instead stuck out his hand and said it was nice to meet me.  Why, I ask, are gay men so unpredictable?  Rupert meanwhile, was sniffing around another gum-chewer, until he heard him talk and the decision was quickly made to change venues.  So then, to The Cock.  Why, I ask, am I so predictable?  The Cock was hopping (that sounds dirty, doesn't it?).  Great music, as usual, boys we knew and boys we didn't, and, mostly importantly to me tonight, vodka.  Freshly armed, we strolled about, listening in on conversations, catching up on each others lives (our variously abused substances making us rather chatty).  Rupert decided to do a Love Lap on his own, so I gave him space by making one in the opposite direction.  There in the back lounge were Alberto and Mark.  After a bit (and another vodka) I decided I should probably check on my little tripping pal (and maybe pee), so I excused myself and went to do a little search of the bar.  I think this is where I noticed that someone had replaced my shoes with some sort of footwear made entirely of  urlLink Weebles .  Mercifully, Weebles wobble, but the don't fall down.  I after successfully navigating the treachorously flat floor, I found Rup sitting on the dark banquette engaged in some sort of gum-chewing exchange.  Knowing that he was in good, umm, hands, I peed and returned to Alberto and Mark.  But only Alberto was left.  "Where's Mark?"  "Oh, he's out there," Alberto said with a casually wave of the back of his hand towards an ever-growing cluster of young men in the middle of the back lounge.  "I think he's sucking face with some Asian guy he met earlier."  Oh.  Well.  As I leaned against the wall taking in that information, even more information came to me.  "You know I've always thought you were really sexy," Alberto confessed.  I tried to come up with some sort of response but couldn't make my tongue work.  No...wait...that's not  my  tongue, that's  Alberto's  tongue.  My poor vodka-logged thought processors were trying to match this up to reality, but were slow to react, making me seem complicit.  It's not that Alberto's not adorable, he certainly is.  But he's not  my  type of adorable.  Plus, he's got a boyfriend and I don't picnic in that park anymore.  I extricated myself, I hope gracefully (I guess I'll find out by the reception I get at the gym next time I see them).  About this time, Rupert ambled up with his latest gum-chewer, a nice boy from Chile.  "I have to be up early for my flight, so I'm going back to my hotel."  "Umm, Ruppie, you're not staying in a hotel."  "I am now," he said impishly, giving me a peck on the cheek and a warm hug.  "I'll call you from L.A." and off he went to improve our relations with South America.  It was my cue to go as well.  I was now faaaaar past the drinky-winky point that any sane 38-year-old should reach.  All I wanted was a fast taxi, a cool bedroom and a warm puppy.  Easier said than done.  There were no cabs for me.  I walked from Avenue A and 13th Street to Sixth Avenue and 25th Street before I found a cab.  Along the way I did manage to find two McRib Jr. sandwiches, a Diet Coke, and some sort of Sour Apple Twizzler-esque candy.  Don't ask (wouldn't do you any good anyway).  I made it home, took the Dex outside, fell into bed and slept the sleep of the tragically vodkaed.  Sunday?  The final performance of  urlLink A Class Act .  My pal Patrick got me tickets to see the final performance of this quirky show (I had also seen the gypsy run-through).  It was, for so many reasons, a really touching performance.  This cast has stuck together through a lot of crap and really made this material personal and interesting and touching.  Lonny Price, the writer, director, and start, actually checked himself out of the hospital to perform these songs for the last time.  Backstage was packed after, and as usual, I was asked what I was up to; what was I in.  Trouble, I answered blithely and moved on.  I'm so glad I didn't miss this last performance, even if I had to sit in the middle of a pack of poorly-dressed, ill-informed, unmannered yahoos from the provinces who apparently believe that the theatre is the perfect place to prop your feet up on the back of the chair in front of you, chat it up, and eat sunflower seeds (depositing the husks on the floor).  Why, I ask you, are yahoos so predictable?  All in all, not a bad weekend.  I successfully managed to avoid a hangover, meaningless sex, ruining any friendships, damaging insights, most of the Puerto Rican parade, meaningless crying jags, being hacked to death by my stalker, indigestion, answering direct questions about my career, breaking up any relationships, and Valium.  Who could ask for anything more?

       Dance Like No One's Watching   urlLink This prom  took place last night on Long Island.  Wow.  Saw it on the news last night, including interviews with some of the kids and, well, it made me kinda misty.    I went to my 9th grade prom alone.  I went because I was part of the student council that had organized it and I was the only one with any taste that could organize the decorations, etc.  I rented an all white tux, I danced with no one, made myself busy with pretend errands, and  had my picture taken with Mrs. Kaat, my English teacher (at her request).  My mother dropped me off and picked me up after -- went straight home.  There was a big Led Zepplin concert at Tampa Stadium that night and traffic was terrible so I was stuck in a Gremlin in a white tux and my mother, surrounded by redneck headbangers in pickups with Confederate flags and gun racks.  Yay prom night.  The next school dance I went to was a  urlLink Sadie Hawkins dance  in my junior year of high school, and I was asked by a girl in chorus, Deanna, to be her date.  I guess she had a crush on me.  I said yes 'cause she was a senior but non-threatening.  We wore overalls and plaid shirts, maybe danced twice (with other people in a circle and  definitely  not touching), went to Denny's after...it was horrendous.  I had no idea what to do with a girl, nor did I care.  I kept looking at Joe Johnson's ass in his tight white overalls with no shirt and that curled up cowboy hat.  I can barely picture Deanna's pimply-but-sweet face, but I can vividly recall every outfit Joe Johnson wore to school.  He sat in front of me in Biology and once asked me how long our half-hour reading break was gonna be.  I loved him, I did.  My senior prom I didn't attend at all.  I knew I was being voted "Most Talented" or some nonsense, but I didn't need them to tell me that back then (I could use it now, though...think it's still sitting on a shelf somewhere?).  I think I was doing a show at the time (community theatre, of course) and also by this time I'd wised up:  I didn't belong there and I wasn't going to pretend to.  Of course, by this time Mac and I had been "dating" for about a year.  I met him through some mutual friends who went to a different high school across town.  One night we left  urlLink Farrell's  (at  urlLink WestShore Plaza  ...important later, as you'll see) and piled into a couple of cars to go to " urlLink The Rocky Horror Picture Show ."  Mac announced that I was riding shotgun in his car and so I did.  It's funny, but twenty-something years later, I remember us looking at each other in the front seat of his mother's white Buick and making some some sort of silent agreement with our eyes...we were co-conspiritors in something we didn't have a name for but excited us all the same.  We sat next to each other during the movie as well, and my left hand found his right soon after the lights went down.  I couldn't wait until we could drop everyone else off, which we did, then made our way to the second level of the parking garage at WestShore.  I don't think I've ever been that excited in my life and, y'know what?  I'd give anything to relive that night again.  I was in his arms, he was in mine and nobody was telling us it was wrong.  I'm pretty sure we both fell in love that night; I know I did.  We saw each other every chance we got.  I remember the two of us sitting under the same rain pancho at a football game, our head sticking out of the same hood.  People just thought we were " urlLink wild and crazy guys " (if they could've only seen our hands!).  He also talked me into letting his drama club use my  urlLink Triumph Spitfire convertible  (did I mention I was an only child?) as a float in their homecoming parade (without telling me that the they were playing my high school until we started to round the bend to that side).  Sure, we had a lot of teenage sex (and many times at the second floor of the WestShore parking garage), but we also made each other laugh a lot and we cared about each other.    So I guess it's fitting that we took to of our friends from our debating club (actually,  urlLink NFL , so we were geeks) to his prom.  We danced for awhile (in a circle, of course), took our dates to Friday's after, dropped them off, then we broke into my father's house (he was out of town, or something) and fooled around on his king-sized bed.  Now that's a prom night.  If only it had been okay for me to hold his hand in public, to dance with Mac, instead of Vivian, under that mirrorball at that prom.  Would we still be together?  Would he still be alive?  Who knows...  I think those kids are damn lucky.  I also think they've got balls to attend something like that and talk on tv about it.  I can't wait until there's not a separate prom for 'em.  Oh, one side note (and don't let it make you sad, really).  At Mac's memorial service, I was feeling really strange about being there, with his mother whom I hadn't seen in years (and who was convinced I'm made Mac gay...as if) and his current lover of many years, etc., feeling like even though we'd seen each other over the years, I'd never gotten to tell him how much he'd meant to me and to apologize for things I'd needed to (he hadn't told anyone he was sick and he certainly didn't tell anyone he was in the hospital).  So I was sitting off to the side feeling a little sorry for myself, but started talking with a really nice woman.  I asked her how she'd known Mac and she told me that she'd been one of his doctors during his last hospital stay, but had gotten very attached to him (not hard to do).  She told me how she'd stay with him when the meds kept him awake, sometimes all night long, and listened to his stories.  Then she asked how I'd known him.  I said we'd been friends together in high school but we sorta lost touch and that made this all the sadder.  She asked my name and I told her.  She said "Oh, I know all about you...he talked about you a lot, actually."  I honestly thought she was just being nice about it, that maybe he'd mentioned my name.  We talked some more and, when it was time to leave, she grabbed both of my hands and made me look her in the eye and said to me, "You were his first love, you know."  I guess she saw me wanting to believe it, but that I didn't quite, and then she said:   "Next time you're in Tampa, why don't you stop by the second floor parking garage of WestShore and say goodbye to it for him."

       Around The World In 180 Degrees  Something's shifted.  I'm different than I was this time last week.  Not-so-subtly different, but I can't exactly put my finger on it either.  While the problems are still with me, the hopelessness is gone.  My perspective's done a 180 (as the rednecks I grew up with would say...if they had perspectives).  First and foremost, I've been waking up.  This is big, since I've been known to sleep until 1 or 2 pm, followed by brunch and a nap.  But for the past few days I've been waking up and staying up, alert and, goddess forbid, with a sense of humor.  I realized this last night when I looked at Dex slumbering on the floor next to my desk.  "What're you so tired for?" I asked him.  Then I realized that the long afternoon nap he'd been accustomed to taking together had been cut out.  Well, I thought, that's because I've been getting more sleep.  But that's not true either because, while I've been going to sleep around 2am as per usual, I've been waking up at 9:30.  Not just waking up, getting up.  The last two days I've woken up before the alarm, turned off the alarm instead of hitting snooze, enjoyed a little morning snuggle with Dex, gotten up and dressed, walked the boy, made and consumed a healthy breakfast, then hopped on the Big Orange Bike for an hour's  urlLink ride along the Hudson  (with only a third the usual pedestrian rage).  After my ride I've been working out, then meeting someone for coffee or lunch, then off to Temp Hell (where I haven't been particularly cranky either).  Come home from work, clean or pack or do laundry, maybe meet a friend for a drink, etc., then to bed and actual sleep.  There's no time for napping and, more astonishingly, I haven't been aching for it.  And I guess that means that I haven't hated being conscious.  Well, okay.  But why?  What changed?  What caused the change?  How do I sustain it?  How do I  urlLink kick it up a notch ?  I. Don't. Know.  I'm still a month and a half behind on rent and I don't know where that money's gonna come from.  My job at The Evil Empire is gonna end any second now, we all know it (although as the only temp, I fear it more than the others who work here who'll get lovely severance packages).  And then there's the weird thing that happened at the gym.  All of these things seem to threaten this recent and (in my mind) tenuous positive change in my life.  So, what I think I have to... what?   Oh. Yeah.  Well, something odd happened at the gym.  Anyway, I think that I have to now... what?   No, I don't think I can talk about it because I don't know exactly what it means.  Good point -- when  has  that stopped me?  Alright, here's the weird thing that happend at the gym:  A couple of nights ago, I'm working out.  Chest and tris.  I'm hating the mirrors because it's now obvious that, during my lengthy depression, seeking comfort in the Holy Trinity ( urlLink Wendy's ,  urlLink Ben & Jerry ) has not done my body good.  An 18-wheeler with a flat would cheer up if it  urlLink saw me coming .  But I'm lifting hard, 'cause muscle burns fat.  Okay.  I'm not even looking around between sets because (a) I don't want anyone I know to see me while I'm this hefty and (2) I don't want anyone I don't know to see me while I'm this hefty.  But sometimes I can't help myself, things catch my eye.  And I see, across the room, one of my all-time gym favorites (you see where this is going, right?).    I can't say I really have a type (a slut is easily pursuaded) but if I had to choose, 75% of all the men I'm most attracted to fit into this category: dark, Italian-esque, beefy rather than lean, my height, furry, with a little something edgy about them.  This boy has it in spades.  He's never looked at me.  That's right, boys and girls, until this evening...  I'm doing tricep pull downs with the rope thingy while he's at the machine next to me doing bicep curls.  He's kinda looking at me when he thinks I can't see him, but I can't determine the look -- interested or annoyed.  Then I catch him looking at me and he doesn't look away, although he doesn't acknowledge me either.  I'm not gonna set myself up, so I finish the triceps and go upstairs to shower and leave.  I'm not up there two minutes before Dream Boy shows up.  Coincidence, of course.  I get into my towel and decide, foolishly, to weigh myself.  His locker is just steps from the scale.  If there were any chance that he's actually looking at me  in that way , this'll turn him off, I think.  The only thing it changes is how deliberately he's undressing.  And folks, it's beautiful.  Really.  Munchy, the Ever Lovin' Love Snack.  Whatever, I'm gonna shower and get outta here.  I go into the little stall, pull my shower curtain as closed as it'll go.  But there's still a little crack open and through it I see Munchy Dream Boy.  He's at the shower next to mine, preparing his water temperature, but also peeking into my stall.  I'm unnerved.  I finish, pop into the steamroom for a sec, which is crowded, and try to breathe.  Who's in after me?  Who asks the guy sitting next to me to scoot over so he can sit next to me?  Who's furry leg artfully brushes mine?  Who's hand drops discreetly into his untoweled lap?  Who's looking at me with peripheral vision while I look at him with same?  I feel a little stirring, but I'm  so  not going there.  I go back to the showers, so does he.  I close my curtain, he does not.  I towel dry, he stares me down in the mirror opposite.  I go back to my locker to change, he saunters back to the steamroom giving me the eye all the way.  I get dressed and leave.  Why is that weird, you might ask?  Easy.  I could've fooled around with a Delicious Dream Boy and I didn't want it.  Well, no, I  wanted  it, but I didn't  just  want it.  And, dichotomous as it might sound, even though I'm feeling not great about the way I look, I didn't want to be thought of just sexually.  I guess I could've just tossed one off with him in the steamroom, would've been fine, but not satisfying.  I know what it's like, I've done it, it was great fun, but it was just one of those things.  I have no desire for sex right now.  None.  I have to make clear that I don't mean I'm not feeling sexual, I just don't want sex.  I've jerked off more in the past couple of days then I have in the past couple of months.  I want to be in a relationship very much, but I can't do that and get myself through the next few months.  And I want to be sexual with someone, very much, but I don't think I want it without some sense of also being wanted on another level.  Yeah, I know, normal people feel this all the time.  Excuse me, perhaps we haven't met:  I'm the Everlasting Blogstalker.  Normal doesn't exist here.  Validation through sex is usually accepted in these parts.  It's unsettling when the rules have changed, especially when it seems I'm the one that change them.  So I'm in a kind of  urlLink purgatory , but a pleasant purgatory.  I'm enjoying the sunshine and my dog, but I wonder how long it's gonna last.  It's a purgatory where I'm really unhappy with my physical state, but I'm loving eating well and working out and biking.  I guess I'm suspicious of my positive attitude, even though I'm not denying my problems.  Maybe it's not purgatory, maybe it's just homosexuality.  Doesn't matter, this is much better than craving a Clorox Cocktail, as I did last week.  Still, I wonder...what's next and how'm I gettin' there?

       Dreamweaver  So last Saturday night, the night before the Tonys (did I mention I went to the Tonys?), I had a strange dream.  It makes no sense to me, so anyone with any insight into this whatsoever, let me hear from you.  I dreamt that I was in a Broadway show and was sharing my dressing room with a good friend of mine, a girl (not someone I actually know).  We were having a great time but somehow the entire cast got abducted by some producer-types mildly connected with our show.  The took us to a sort-of dirigible, like an ocean liner, but it floated gently in the air.  There were three of them holding us hostage, sometimes at gunpoint, and finally I decided that there were more of us than them and we were gonna turn the tables on them.  I organized my cast and we overtook our captors.  I personally pushed one of the evil ones over the prow of the air-ship(his name, I remember, was Ron, but wasn't nearly as cute as  urlLink this Ron ).    Almost as soon as we had control, a storm started brewing and none of us knew how to steer the ship.  There was thunder and lightning and we were tossed around for a bit, but I finally got us toward some land and some guys on the ground grabbed our mooring ropes and helped pull us in.  We didn't know where we were or what day it was, and the gentleman who had been so helpful, didn't speak English.  I seemed to understand that we were somewhere called Zeeland.  As the  de facto  leader of the group, I started walking a small group of us around to find out where we really were and to get word back to the States.  We walked up a main road and I saw a hotel with a shanty little petting zoo next to it and I remembered being there when I was on tour in Europe.  I got everyone settled into rooms and then I settled into mine to clean up before I headed off to try to call for help.  I figured a quick shower would make me look and feel better before I found the authorities.  I had a big suite, almost like a separate cottage, but it was very low-rent banana republic.  The shower itself was large, but bordered on two sides by jalousie windows.  I was showering for a few minutes before I noticed a shape outside one of the windows.  There was a very attractive man with long black hair watching me shower.  It startled me at first, and so I said "Hey!" which startled the man and he ran off.  I moved closer to the window to watch him run away, and then noticed that I could see the whole parking lot and there was a sort of carnival set up in it.  To my left was a small ferris wheel, and I could see some other rides as well.  Suddenly, but smoothly, the shower I was in became a sort of ride itself.  That's all I remember of this segment.  Next I was walking towards the part of town where I knew there'd be a police station.  On the way there, I passed a sort of plaza that had these concrete, futuristic umbrellas.  I remembered that on my last trip to Zeeland people had been lined up in this area to get their phone cards adjusted, etc.  I also remember one particular woman who had had a particular problem, arguing with the cashier.  I should mention at this point that Zeeland, while being a European country and, ostensibly German/Dutch speaking, looked far more like Panama, and the people looked Carribbean.  I came to the Police Station and the officer in charge while not being particularly interested in my story, was helpful enough to allow me to use his phone.  I turned to the desk next to the chair in which I was sitting, and couldn't figure out which of the items on the desk was the phone.  I reached towards a Rolodex looking item, but the officer instead flipped open a box, inside of which was an odd sort of dark turquoise-colored phone.  I tried a couple of times to make the call, but couldn't figure out how to make an outside call, and the officer assisted.  And that's all I remember of that segment.  When I got back to the room, the shot was from above and the entrance to my cottage was a more tropical version of, well (and I so hesitate to say this) Marilyn's entrance in "Something's Gotta Give."  Anyway.  So I get back into my room, and I notice that someone's been in there.  Then the bathroom door opens and a woman comes out.  I ask what she's doing in my room and she seems honestly confused about how she got there. Then we're somehow joined by two other women, one of whom is trying to show her clothing samples to the bathroom woman.  I'm tired from all the saving and leading I've been doing and so I finally ask these women to leave.  The clothing sample woman is miffed by this, but I don't feel bad because they shouldn't have been in my room conducting business.  As I get back into the room, I hear a knock on the door.  I figure it's the women again, but I go down a long hallway and open the door to find my entire cast, photographers flashing cameras, and cheering strangers.  It's very "Notting Hill."  My cast has come to collect me for a victory dinner before we head back home.  I say that I'm not quite ready to go, but I'll clean up and meet them there in a few minutes.  I have to stress that I don't feel at all caught unawares or nervous about having to get ready or about the photographers.  I just need time to dress and I'll catch up with them when I'm ready.  That's the whole dream.  Goofy, huh?  I mean, who dreams of being held hostage on a dirigible?  Apparently me.  So, what  does  that dream mean?

       Flash Gordon Was There In Silver Underwear  So, the Rocky Horror Tony Party...  It was held in the new upstairs space at Studio 54.  Now, when I moved to New York in 1983, 54 was having its last gasp, but there were still lots of elements of the heydey...the same Moon with a Spoon over the dance floor, the fabled Halston Reception Room (aka the Men's Room), etc.  Now the show "Cabaret" uses the main floor and former dance floor areas.  This party space is upstairs where the bigger bathrooms and upstairs lounge was.  I knew Studio 54, and this was no Studio 54.  The ceiling is low and the dance floor is small.  But the I knew the bar would be open and I'd soon forget about 1983.  Indeed, I soon forgot my name.  Let's approach the velvet ropes, you and I.  My name's on the guest list, so come in with me, won't you?  There's JSquared right inside the door, holding an adult vodka beverage with my name on it.  A quick hug of congratulations and I'll down this drink on my way to the bar to get us fresh ones.  At the bar, in a wife beater and having a very, very intent conversation with a trashy blonde is Tony winner (for "Damn Yankees") and Rocky Horror's own Brad, Jerrod Emick.  Apparently this conversation has something to do with the various tastes of the inner ear, so we won't bother them.  I'll just grab our drinks and head back to the group.  JSquared is chatting with several friends of ours and a diminuitive sassy girl drinking a split of Mumm's with a straw.  JSquared says, "You remember Daisy Eagan, don't you?"  Well, of course I do.  The little Tony winner (for "The Secret Garden") stops sipping long enough to ask "How the fuck are ya?"  She and her boyfriend are a riot and we mock our fellow party guests for awhile.  I decide to take my life into my hands by venturing into a horde of Jersey Girlz who are hoarding the cheese squares, and bring back a stack for my group who tears into them like they'd never seen chunks o'cheddar before.  The kids decide to go off and dance but I'm not ready, so let's scan the room to see who else we know.  But first, we ought to refresh our vodka.  We squeeze our way back to the bar and, look there's Tony winner (for "The Life")Lillias White.  She's not happy with the bottles of water the bar has, "do you believe this?" she asks us, showing the bottle.  "It looks like an economy bottle of lube," I respond.  She considers this a moment and takes off with it.   I wonder if maybe there's something on the other side of the dance floor to nibble on other than cheese.  We're rewarded with the site of Sebastien LaCause (Rocky in "Rocky Horror") and his Ford model/law school student boyfriend.  Not the nibble we're looking for, but we feast our eyes for a second anyway.  Ah, there's a big plate of crudite just to the left.  The only thing standing between us and it is a hideous woman in a plaid skirt.  Wait, that's no woman, it's Christopher Malcolm in a kilt.  Christopher was the original Brad in the London "Rocky Horror" and also plays Edina's first husband and Saffie's father on "Absolutely Fabulous."  We don't know him but we compliment his legs anyway.  He's nice and kicks his leg up behind him.  The dance floor is heating up now.  Oddly enough, with a sophisticated Manhattan crowd the dj has chosen to play music more suited for a wedding hall in Queens, but there's JSquared out there and so we figure it couldn't hurt to dance to "Mickey" as long as everyone else is.  As we make it out to the center of the floor, the dj wisely slaps on the "Time Warp" and the crowd loses its mind.  Jonathan Sharp (he who earlier got Gwynneth Paltrow up to do this same dance at Radio City) whips his shirt off, as does his chiseled boyfriend.  Not to be outdone, Christopher Siebert (currently on Broadway as "Gaston" in "Beauty and the Beast" but also seen in "Triumph of Love" and, most embarrassingly, as father to the Olsen Twins in their last TV incarnation), unbuttons his shirt to reveal that all those extra muffins from craft service have been melted away to reveal a tasty bod.  The "Time Warp" has also brought to the dance floor Jessie Tyler Ferguson (from "On The Town") and Tony nominated choreographer Jerry Mitchell and his beau.  After getting this crowd really going, the dj segues into "I Love Rock 'n' Roll" by Joan Jett (who recently, infamously, walked out of the cast of "Rocky Horror").  Jordan Roth, Rocky's producer, turns to us and says, "I guess the dj doesn't read The Post."  Guess not.  The dance floor's a little crowded, don't you think?  And, ohmygoddess, our glasses our empty.  Back to the bar we go.  Hmmm, Daphne Rubin Vega (a Tony nominee as "Mimi" in "Rent" and "Rocky Horror"'s own "Magenta") snogging with some awfully tall boy (who, oddly enough, has never been nominated for a Tony).  Let's grab our drinks and run.  Up there in the psuedo-VIP banquette.  That seems to be a funsy group.  And who's in the middle of it all but JSquared.  Feels great to sit for awhile.  What?  Yes, I'd love a little salty snack, but there doesn't seem to be anything around.  I see a tray floating above the crowd...the crowd parts...oh my, it's that prominent Lesbian and Tony nominee for "On The Town" Lea DeLaria and fittingly enough, she has a big tray of sushi.  Careful with that first step, Lea...owwww...sushi everywhere.   Mercifully, not on us, but all over the banquet and floor next to us.  She doesn't seem to be too upset though...I guess she enjoys a fishy smell...  This is almost the last straw.  What we need is a Belgian waffle in a badly-lit booth at The Renaissance Diner.  Let's gather a few of our friends (a company manager, a stage manager, a Broadway columnist) and start to fight our way out.  Oh, oh...not that way, I need to avoid that... HI!   Just leaving actually...careful with that hand, tiger, don't you need it for your camera?  A picture...well, maybe...without the shirt?  Don't think so, sport.  Call you?  Ummm, maybe I'll just see you at the gym.  And, umm, try not to hang outside the showers for our chat, okay?  Papparazzi...so annoying.  As we start towards the stairs and our Belgian waffle, we notice the real star of this party, tonight's Tony nominee for Best Actor in a Musical for his amazing turn as Frank'N'Furter, Tom Hewitt.  Hugs and kisses all around and we tell him that, in  our  version, he walked up the aisle and grabbed the Tony.  He thanks us but says that the whole experience was great just as it was...and he's happy and glowing with his boyfriend by his side, and we believe him.  It's great when nice things happen to nice people.  Down the stairs and over to Ninth Avenue.  We're so exhausted we don't think we can even hold a fork (yeah, like  that'll  ever happen).  We'll put you in a cab here...don't worry, we won't trash your outfit when you're gone.  Thanks for coming with us, it's been a ball, huh?  Bye.....   (Did you see the shoes she had on?)

       Warning:  Gay Homosexual Showtune-Related Blog Ahead  Number of Hellos/Waves in Line:  6 Number of "You Look Beautiful/Wild/Sexy" Comments I Got:  5 Number of Times I Actually Believed It:  2 Number of Times I Denied It:  0 I sauntered over to the Tonys last night around 6:50pm.  Since  urlLink Radio City  is just a couple of blocks from my apartment, I decided to forego the limo and walk...just like a regular person.  It was still light out, so I put on some sassy $4-from-the-street shades (the vendor assured me they were  Oakrey ).  Apparently my attempt at tricking the dregs of my closet into thinking it was some sort of formal wear worked.  Maybe it was the glitter in my hair or the (pear-flavored) gloss on my lips.  Whatever.  As I strolled towards Radio City I pretended in my head that I was Jane Russell in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," and that helped make my stride purposeful but sexy.  It seems that there are two entrances to the Tony Awards:  the "celebrity" entrance and the "non-celebrity" entrance.  I thought it might be fun to try the "non-celebrity" entrance (as it was my only option) and I found it to be deliciously common.  Snaking all the way down 50th Street, I got to pass by everyone already in line, waving and smiling, saying something brief but witty and then walk on.  It was fun.  There were of course a lot of people on the streets and on the other sides of the barracades watching us line up to go in.  Turns out they're  very  interested in guys with glittery hair and unbuttoned pink tuxedo shirts.  Do you ever have those days when everybody on the street thinks they know you from somewhere?  I had one yesterday (thank goddess it wasn't wasted on a laundry day or something).  I waved like I was somebody, they waved back. ( Actually, I waved 'cause I kinda felt sorry for those people...they must've kicked themselves when their friends told them who they saw on 51st Street.)    Once inside I milled around a bit in the lobby, chatted with a high-powered theatrical lawyer who tried to touch me inappropriately and a dessicated diva who seemed heavily medicated, but fun as that was, I quickly made my way to the Grand Staircase.  I love the Grand Staircase at Radio City; it's one of those time portals of Manhattan.  You can just picture  urlLink ladies with hats and gloves , and gentlemen with  urlLink Arrow collars  and  urlLink spectator shoes  on their way in to see "The Philadelphia Story" for the very first time.  It's impossible not to climb that stair and not feel like part of another era.  The balustrade was lined with people scanning the lobby for famous faces, so I sailed up and found a place at the landing.  Oh look, down there's the editor of that showbiz newspaper.  Hi!  Are you really with  him ?  Do you know he backed me up against a wall at the O'Neill Center and fogged up my glasses?  Have a terrific time!  Jeez, Ann Miller.  That dress sure is  red .  My god, there's the Luckiest Chorus Boy in the World...I've been wondering where he'd disappeared to.  From the looks of it, he got locked in the Sara Lee factory and had to eat his way out.  Oops, better not throw those particular stones considering the number of pants I had to try on before I left the house.  There go the lights, better make my way towards my seat.  But first, I have to collect my Playbill. The Tony Award Playbill is something of a collector's item.  Really, it's the Beanie Baby of show programs.  So in order to get your program, you have to go to one of the designated areas and have your ticket punched and you receive one (1).  I needed my ticket punched, so I grabbed my Playbill and headed throught the mist of air kisses toward my seat.    First mezzanine, House Left, Row B.  From my seat I could see all of the nominees below and most of the celebrity guests.  I was sitting more or less in a direct line behind Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft.  On either side of that massive stage, there are two enormous screens so that one can see what's being broadcast, although they turn them off at some points throughout so audience shots don't show people gawking up at them.  There were a few speeches that weren't shown on the first hour (the PBS broadcast) one of them being, I believe, Paul Gemignani's Lifetime Achievement Award.  The man is genius and, even though he knew he was getting it, he was genuinely moved during his speech, thanking not only all of the pit musicians he's worked with whom he called "incredibly talented and wholly devoted to the theatre" and also specifically Stephen Sondheim who he said "taught him to care about music more than he thought possible."  That whole first hour, with Stro winning and thanking Mike, etc., seemed very "inside," but we soon grew tired of the dreaded words: "The Producers."  I was afraid we were going to be forced to have the logo tattooed on our asses before being allowed to leave.  Frankly, that show doesn't need any more money or press.  Ditto "42nd Street."  How 'bout helping out those shows that could use the boost of a Tony win?  Hell, toss 'em lighting design, as long as they can claim "2001 Tony Winner!" in front of the theatre.  But noooooooooo... Number of Actress Performing in Best New Musical category That I Performed with Off Broadway Last Year:  2 Number of Actors Who Are Also Presidents of the Union performing in Best New Musical Category Who Directed Above-Gratuitously-Mentioned Off Broadway Show:  1 Number of 2001 Tony Nominees I've Slept With:  1 Number of 2001 Tony Nominees Whose Boyfriends I've Slept With:  2 Number of People Thanked (in any category) That I've At the Very Least Made Out With:  7 Number of Nominated Playwrights Whose Birthday Parties I Attended on a First Date:  1 Number of Newsanchors I've Slept With That Were Spotted in the Men's Room:  1 Really the best part was celebrating in the success of friends and people I've worked with.  It was exciting to me to have a personal connection to so many people on that stage.  Makes ya feel like it's not such an unattainable thing after all, huh?  Also, commercial breaks were fun with people dashing out of the theatre towards the restrooms or the phones and having impromptu gossip sessions in the lobby.  I used one to reapply my lip gloss (that's when I saw the alleged Newsanchor), and another to call my friends at the party on the Upper West Side, right after Gary Beach's speech mentioning the Upper West Side, to say hey from the glamorous Tonys and that I'd rather be there with the little people, eating salty snax and wearing comfy clothes.  It was almost true, too.  The two numbers that really got the crowd in the auditorium going were "Let It Go" from "The Full Mony" and  "Time Warp" from "Rocky Horror," especially when Jonathan Sharp jumped into the audience and got Gwynneth Paltrow to dance, James Stovall got Andre de Shields to dance, but no one could get Mel Brooks up (guess we don't support other people's shows).  It was pretty clear that Viola Davis was gonna win Best Featured Actress In A Play after what was basically a tour-de-force (while I am forced to tour) monologue from "King Hedley" (how great is Stokes that he set that up for her?).  No one was surprised by Cady Huffman's win, and her speech was sweet, but man, wouldn't you've loved to hear Kathleen Freeman's speech?  Or for that matter Polly Bergen's?  And it's always great to see people like Gary Beach, who've been kicking around this town forever, get a little recognition.  Leaving Radio City I ran into my friend Greg on the Grand Stairway (I love saying Grand Stairway) and we milled for a bit in the lobby saying hi to friends and me, of course, saying hi to strangers (maybe it was the eyeliner, who can say?).  We did a little post-mortem as we walked to Studio 54 for the Rocky party and I thought about my first Tony experience.  I learned a few things and, Gentle Readers, I want to share them with you, just in case you're invited next year:  It's glamorous arriving and leaving but, unless you're nominated, it's like going to Radio City to watch TV. Just because your clothes are shiny doesn't mean they're suitable for evening wear. Also, you  can  wear too many tassles. Tan Hush Puppies will never,  ever  go with that tux. When in doubt, smile and, as you glide past, grab their wrist, wrinkle your forehead a little and say ever-so-sincerely in a lowered voice, "You look ter RIF ic!" Bring snacks. Don't make exasperated noises when someone or something you thought should win didn't.  If you really had any say, you wouldn't be sitting next to me in the First Mezzanine.  Especially in that suit. Do be vocally supportive of your nominated friends.  Apparently they  can  hear it and it makes them smile. Let him cruise you a little, then say hi using his name.  Don't stick around to explain. Don't pretend you're more important that you are. Next year, be more important than you are. At least once during the whole experience, skip almost all the way to the men's room 'cause, dammit, you're at the TONY AWARDS!  The party was a whole 'nother experience, but daddy's a little worn out from floggin' the blog.  Also, I got in around 4am and had to be at The Evil Empire around 9am, so a nappy is in order.  But I promise I'll tell who took their shirts off, which nominated actresses dropped entire trays of sushi on chorus girls, which former Tony winner was drinking splits of champagne with a straw, etc.  I'm gonna go nap with my Tony Playbill under my pillow.  Maybe the Tony Faerie will bring me one of my own...they spin, y'know...

       I've Got A Golden Ticket!  Okay, it's  silver ...but so what?  I'm going to the Tony Awards!  Yay Me!!  Of course, it's black tie and I don't have a tux anymore (my shoulders got to big for it...poor me).  So I'm wearing the black fake Prada suit, with a vintage 60s pink tux shirt with French cuffs (no cufflinks), no tie, eye Kohl, lip gloss, JSquared buzzed my hair last night so it's spiky with lots of grey showing through (might throw a little glitter in it), some sorta chain-y something around my neck, clunky boots.  Since I'm with the Rocky Horror contingent and going to their party at Studio 54 after, pseudo-glam rock is the order of the night.  Don't worry  urlLink baby , it's not shabby-chic-a-licious.  I just went for a little tanning session, walked Dexter, gonna hop in the shower soon, a little Biore self-heating mask, Kiehl's White Eagle shaving cream, mint shampoo...oh yeah.  I'm feeling great about tonight.  I've always loved the Tonys.  It's Drama Fag Christmas.  As a kid in Ybor City, the Tonys were my only real connection to Broadway.  That and cast albums.  Yeah, as in LPs.  I remember watching those numbers just dazzled, thinking how talented and lucky those people were, wondering what a Broadway theatre looked like inside.  Now those people are my friends, those theatres are part of my neighborhood.  Tonight I'm gonna have a ball.  I'm gonna force myself to talk to people I'm in awe of, I'm gonna be happy for everybody who wins, I'm gonna feel sassy and celebrate with my community.  I'm not gonna be afraid.  I'm gonna be a part of it.  Yay me!

       Giving Him Away   When I think of Tom, I think about a night When the Earth smelled of Summer, and the sky was streaked with white. And the soft mist of England was sleeping on a hill. I remember this, And I always will... There are new lovers now on that same silent hill, Looking at the same blue sea. And I know Tom and I are a part of them all. And they're all a part of Tom and me.   I met Peter at an AA New Year's Eve party.  He and I were the only people there not in AA.  I was there with a friend who was having his first sober New Year's and I wanted to support him, Peter was there on a date with a hideous playwright.  We gave each other the eye across the room while dancing to the Lunch Lady song from "Fame" and chatted later about, of all things, Dr. Leakey, and how we'd both wanted to be archeologists.  He lived in L.A. at the time, working in television.  He gave me his address and number before he left, saying "if you're ever in Los Angeles..."  His date glowered at me, but really, I'd never been to L.A. and didn't plan on it.  As my friend Steven and I left the party, I complained about meeting someone who seemed so perfect for me that lived all the way on the other side of the country.  I remember saying this as we were walking right in front of The Saint, trying to hail a cab.   Hello Young lovers whoever you are I hope your troubles are few All my good wishes go with you tonight I've been in love like you   The following weekend, I was racing around running errands, wanting to see the final weekend of a show that was closing but knowing I probably wouldn't make it in time to the TKTS booth.  I did, though.  At intermission I wandered downstairs to get some air, and, on my way back up, ran into Peter coming down the stairs.  We chatted for just a few minutes before the lights flashed for the second act, but in that time he managed to tell me that the Dreadful Playwright had dumped him just after New Year's.  I asked him if he'd like to have dinner after the show and he accepted.  The show, by the way, was "Romance/Romance."  We wandered over to Ninth Avenue and ate in this little Italian dive.  The conversation was so amazing, the chemistry like none I'd known.  After dinner he walked me home, came in, chatted some more, kissed.  I knew I was in love.  He was going back to L.A. in just a few days, and we saw each other a couple more times before he left.  I had no idea what would happen or if I'd ever see him again.  In my 26-year-old head I figured the distance was final.  But we talked every day.  I visited him, he visited me.  We wrote long letters and sent each other presents, surprises.  After six months, he packed up his life in L.A. and moved to New York to live with me.   Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star Be brave and faithful and true Cling very close to each other tonight I've been in love like you   We understood each other so well then.  Our frame of references so similar that it was like being twins.  I think we even began to sound alike.  Our own mothers mistook us on the phone for each other.  We were happy, we laughed all the time.  People thought we were the perfect couple and, smugly, we agreed.   I know how it feels to have wings on your heels And to fly down a street in a trance. You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet And you meet!   Not really by chance   What happened then?  I suppose we grew apart...or maybe we just grew up.  We changed in our thirties.  Our interests we still similar, but diverged.  There wasn't an ugly argument really, or some final event.  We'd just become two adults different from the kids who had fallen in love.  I think our views on what happens in a relationship were also very different.  He came from a big, traditional Italian family, a mother and father who were married 'til death one did part.  I'd had no relationship models, only what I thought it could be in my head.  I know that I felt the passion draining and I didn't know how to keep it from happening.  My world was contracting rather than expanding.  Peter was fine with that, I wanted more.  I guess, in the end, I pressed for us to separate because I thought together we'd (read I'd) never grow as individuals.  I think we both thought we'd get back together eventually.  Peter met Luke not long after we separated.  They've been together since.  I think they're comfortable because neither pushes the other, neither questions the other, their lives intersect just as they are.  I'm not judging it...in fact, I admire it, to a point, although I'd never be happy in that kind of a relationship.  I want to be challenged.  I want to challenge.  I want chemistry and a similar frame-of reference.  I want to grow together and individually.  I'd hope that there would always be new things to discover and new passions in which to indulge.  Settled, but not too.  And I haven't found anyone equal to that task yet.   Don't cry young lovers, whatever you do Don't cry because I'm alone. All of my mem'ries are happy tonight I've had a love of my own.   While Peter and Luke have been together for six years or so, now (certainly longer than Peter and I were together), today, on the day of their commitment ceremony, I feel a finality to my relationship with Peter.  I could never be in that relationship again, I'm not that person anymore.  We'd kill each other in the first week (but he'd make me do the actual butchering, that was one of our patterns).  But that part of me that doesn't understand logic, still wonders what happened to the man I was going to spend the rest of my life with.  And wonders, too, if that excitement, that racing heart, that contented feeling of having one person in the world who holds you above all others, that someone with whom you can do nothing and  love  it -- if any of that will ever be mine again?  When Peter told me a year ago that he and Luke were going to do this, he asked me to give him away.  I pointed out that I'd already done that, and we both laughed.  But even though I can't physically be there, maybe that's what I'm doing today.  Of course I love you, Peter.  You're gentle and bright and quirky.  I don't think I've ever loved anyone in that way.  We grew up together, in our way.  And maybe that was the problem:  we grew up.  But I couldn't have done it without you, and I wouldn't have wanted to do it with anyone else.  Thanks, HH.  Now go get married...   I've had a love of my own, like yours. I've had a love of my own.

       Light, Happiness & Chicken  I didn't get to bed last night until very late, and I had to be at The Evil Empire early-ish this morning, so I only go a couple hours of sleep.  Usually that's a bad thing for me.  But I woke up before the alarm went off.  My lower back didn't hurt, my neck wasn't stiff, that manatee or whatever it is that's been sitting on top of my chest for the past couple of days had wandered off and I could breathe without anxiety.  I felt  light .   Not that everything's all better.  I've got a lot to do and I'm not sure how to do it all.  I'm still overwhelmed, but I'm not feeling as  hopeless  about it.  And apparently I made some people mad because I wrote about my desparation.  All I can tell you is, I didn't write it for you, and writing about it (much as I wouldn't have believed it to be true) made it better.  Wasn't being a drama queen, don't really need the attention, sorry you were upset.  I was upset, too.  Still am, I guess.  And yet calmer about it.  RJ asked me this morning what my plans were.  I said I was thinking about chicken for lunch.  That's about as far ahead as I can plan and about as little control as I have.  I know tomorrow morning a little piece of me will be sad when I realize that the Cathoholic (oh, let's call him Peter, he was a saint, too) is getting married.  Peter always accused me of having too many feelings, I always accused him of showing only one.  He wanted everything to be happy all the time, no matter what.  I don't really believe in that so much.  My box of feelings has all the colors in it (and a little sharpener in the front) and I don't see why I shouldn't use them all.  Turns out he  wasn't  really happy all the time and all that pretending didn't make it so.    Peter's one of the smartest men I've ever known.  A Shakespearean scholar.  Kind, sweet, and absolutely no common sense whatsoever.  He also managed to be helpful and supportive to everyone else in our lives but me.   That  I'm probably still bitter about.  When I spend time with him now, I see exactly why we were together and exactly why we're not.  Years ago, before it was really all that fashionable, I asked him if we could have a commitment ceremony.  I loved more than I had ever loved anyone, would have done anything for him, and I wanted everyone to share in that.  My family, his, our friends.  I thought it would create an even stronger bond and give us something extra to hold onto when things got tough.  He laughed at me.  I think he was embarrassed by the idea, and I don't think he found any value in it.  What can I tell you?  This commitment ceremony that takes place tomorrow was his idea.  He and Luke, who've been together practically since Peter and I broke up (about six years), have registered at Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn (and someplace called Simon Pearce), and are making their union known at Peter's brother's showplace brownstone in the West Village.  I don't wanna go.  But I do wanna cry.  And, frankly, I think I deserve a cut of the bounty just for breaking in the groom...  I can be totally high maintenance.  I'm complicated as hell.  I'm moody and too smart for my own good.  But I'm also extremely loving and loyal.  Once I've got some trust going, I'm an amazing communicator.  I'm great in bed, and I'm funny out of it.  I can even cook several things really well.  I don't know if I'm a catch, but I know I'm worth the effort.  And maybe someday, some incredibly intuitive man will take me to  urlLink One If By Land  and propose to me.  But right now I'm not gonna dwell on that, because I'll get overwhelmed.  I need to pack. I need to get together an outfit for the Tony Awards. And I think I'm gonna have chicken for lunch.  Be happy, Peter and Luke...but not all the time, okay?

       The Party's Over...  I guess it must've started on Tuesday night, at the TransAtlanticBlogMeat.  Well, to be really accurate it probably started sometime in the summer of 1993, but let's just skip all that and start with the BlogMeat.  Many drinks.  Then Wednesday night at The Lure and many, many more drinks.  Then Thursday night at the West Side Club, with Richard and various other substances.  Friday night after work the evil JSquared tricked me into more drinking, although not nearly as much.  Then came Saturday...  Saturday night was the birthday of a dear shrink friend of mine, Dr. Longjohn, thrown by his partner of many years, the ever-so-handsome Rhett.  While I really had no business attending yet another social function where alchohol (etc.) would be served, it was the good doctor's 40th and the first half was taking place on the  urlLink Schooner Adirondack .  Since I had to work all day, thus preventing me from attending what sounded like a  urlLink hip ,  urlLink happening   urlLink afternoon , I used the quiet time at work to rest up and prepare.  After all, a relaxing sail around New York harbor sounded like exactly what I needed.  Yeah.  About 20 of us gathered at  urlLink Chelsea Piers  and chatted and caught up dockside until it was almost time for the Birthday Boy to arrive, when we put on our eyepatches and earrings (the boat portion was pirate themed, don'tcha know) and went below to wait for him.  [One side note:  I seemed to be the leading authority on which ear to place the earring to denote top or bottom.  I just put mine in my nose.]  One of Rhett and Dr. Longjohn's good friends is a fellow psychiatrist from South Africa named Ben.  Ben and I see each other maybe once or twice a year, usually at parties like this one, where we flirt mercilessly for several hours, hang all over each other, laugh, and then never do anything about it.  Dr. Longjohn has tried to push it to another level, but neither Ben nor I have ever picked up the cue.  Of course, Ben was attached to my side for most of the boatride.  When it got windy, he snuggled up into me (the man is incredibly vain, so his body's flawless and fun to hold), we laughed at what we later learned people thought were private little jokes.  Maybe they were.  What we did learn was that the people who didn't really know us, thought we were an old married couple.  We were both asked, several times, how long we'd been together, etc.  It bemused me no end.  We sailed for about two hours, out as far as the Statue of Liberty and around the harbor a bit.  It was a beautiful night, not to windy, with a hazy half-moon in the sky and the jewel necklace of Lower Manhattan on the horizon.  I hear Jersey could be seen in the other direction, I just didn't look.  It actually was relaxing (so were the three cosmos).  The wind started to pick up a little too much right toward the end, but it honestly felt like we'd been out a whole afternoon and I was quite subdued by the time we returned (the three cosmos helped, too).    Then we were off to Rhett and Dr. Longjohn's groovy Upper West Side apartment for the cake portion of the party (the theme here was Pink Disney Princess...but the pink light was very flattering).  More laughs, cake, a singing candle, and, Rhett's favorite, marijuana.  Now, I'm not a big smoker.  I'm just not a good inhaler.  Really (and you know I've admitted to far worse than this).  But the couple of times I've actually caught any buzz from pot was when Rhett was supervising and teaching me the fine points of inhaling.  This night, the lesson was: Bonghits 101.  Interesting.  I was now, apparently, funnier.  At least to Ben.  And just after we'd flirted quite strongly in front of a couple from Miami, and I gave him a stern look and went looking for more vodka (like I needed it), I heard one of the couple ask, "You guys have been together awhile, right?"  I laughed loudly from the kitchen, and Ben had to explain that we'd never even gone out on a date.  "But," the Miami Boy tried to argue, "when he walked outta here he gave you a look like he  owned  you."  Which made Ben really giggle.  I explained that our relationship is like Brigadoon:  we see each other once a year, have a perfectly flirty night, and then disappear into the mists never to think of the other until the next party."  They wouldn't believe us.  Odd.    I finally had to sit for a bit, talking to an editor from Random House, and my friend Dottie with whom I worked Off-Broadway for a couple of years.  The energy was slowly draining out of me (and so was the vodka), so I wasn't sure I completely understood when Ben came over and said, "I'm going.  It was great seeing you again.  We should finally have dinner or something.  I'll get your number from the boys."  A little peck and he was gone.  Dottie looked at me with an arched eyebrow, I looked back quizzically.  "At least you'll get dinner out of it," she said.  "Nah, he won't call.  Trust me."  And I hope he doesn't.  Why ruin our good thing?  I managed to get home around 5am or so, walk Dex (who kept sniffing my face and pulling back...nice, thanks dog).  Slept the sleep of the dead until the middle of the afternoon on Sunday.  Then it was almost time for movie night with JSquared.  Hedwig, dinner, home.  Easy...I can do this...    The Road to Hell is paved with good intentions.  The Express Slide to Hell, however, is shiny and smooth and offers no impediment.  Guess which one I'm on?  Well,  was  on.  I'm gettin' off this ride.  The party's over.  I don't exactly know the logistics of getting an eighteen-wheeler up thirteen stories in an elevator, around a sharp turn in the hallway, how you then get it to back over me a couple of times, and not have me wake up once.  But I assure in the name of all that's hyperbole, that's what happened.  I feel like crap.  And not so pretty.  I'm too old for this and it's not even all that much fun anymore.  So I now enter a period of purification.  No drugs, no alcohol, no sex, practically no Ben & Jerry's.  For at least a month (the roadtrip will probably be a small breaking point in this, but only for its duration).  It shouldn't be all that hard, people do tend to take "no" as an answer from me.  I just have to remember to give it...

       It's For You...  If you're supposed to be driving my taxi, or ringing up my newspaper and gum, or ordering in front of me at McDonald's, or walking down a crowded midtown Manhattan sidewalk, or maybe even just riding down in the elevator with me: please perform the activity in front of you and get off the goddamned cellphone.  Especially in the elevator.  You know that face you make when the bike messenger has his Walkman on too loud?  That's the face I'm making at you when you're shouting into your cellphone in that tiny, echoey elevator.    Let's face it:  you're not a multitasker.  You've narrowly avoided slamming into a bus and almost sideswiped a biker because you've got to talk about...well, I don't know what, my Urdu's not what it used to be.  But you're not hitting those consonants like it's life or death, so just hang up.  You think you're being hip and funny by blabbering away while you order your McNuggets, but what you're really doing is holding up everyone behind you and confusing the already-limited braincell capacity of the hairnet behind the counter.  Order your processed chicken food and go sit at a table and talk.  You cannot walk and talk on the phone at the same time.  You think you can, but you just can't.  Pull over to the side and talk about the movie.  Or better yet, go find a booth.  It's fun!  Consider it a kind of retro thingy.  That's how we used to talk on the phone in public in the 80s...  And I ask you, really, do you think you're working out as hard as you possibly can with that phone to your ear?  I think if you focused that phone energy on your cardio instead you wouldn't have that ass.  Just a thought.  But most importantly, if we're out for coffee or dinner or whatever, don't take that call.  Don't do it.  Lots of times before you had that cellphone, you'd be away from home and your phone would ring and you never even knew it.  And those calls weren't any more important.  So just don't take it.  If you have some really, really, life changing call that you're waiting for, that's a different story.  But I can tell from the "how did he  look ?" comment that no one's life is being altered here.  Except maybe mine.  Because now I'm forced to pay extra-close attention to the placemat describing cocktails from the past forty years.  Or stare out the window and pretend that I'm really enjoying being in suspended conversation.  You see, we were having a conversation before the phone rang and you did a little contortive dance to get at it.  We were actually talking about something kinda important, but even if we weren't, I'm the person in front of you.  When you answer your cellphone while you're sitting with me, it makes me feel like you're waiting for a better offer.  Those cellphone people, they've made it very easy to not answer the phone.  Yup, they tell you who's calling and they even provide a little person inside the phone to answer when you can't.  Those cellphone people, they must know what it's like to be playing with the little sleeve your straw came in, rolling it tighter and tighter until you get to the end and let it go and watch the curl kinda spring out.  When I was a boy, phones had "cords" and you could only go so far with them (they also had "dials," but that's a whole 'nother blog).  When they rang, you didn't know who was calling and, if you didn't pick up, you probably never knew.  If you wanted to screen calls, you'd better have a maid.  And if someone tried to call while you were talking on the phone, they got a "busy signal."  Times sure have changed here on Walton's Mountain.  Now I think it's terrific that pregnant women stranded in stalled vehicles on dangerous highways have a wireless means of communication, but why does everyone need to be in constant telephonic contact?  We don't have all that much interesting to say.  Trust me, I'm forced to hear it.  Why can't it wait until you're finished with the task in front of you?  And if you're the one on the phone, how come I'm the one on hold?

       But If You Try Sometimes, You Just Might Find...  So after ladling out my sage advice like so much  urlLink chilled cucumber mint soup  at a Martha Stewart summer dinner, I finally served myself a big bowl of it and went to the West Side Club last night.  I'd been whining about wanting attention and needing to be touched and so I just shut up and did something about it.  And, oddly enough, it didn't turn out so bad.  After work I shaved, showered, trimmed the topiary, added a little hair product but did not add deodorant and headed for the R train.  But instead of getting out at 23rd Street, I got off at 34th Street to take myself for a walk and give myself a stern talking-to before arrival.  Basically I reminded myself of the cucumber, er,  urlLink advice  I gave Tinman about the place.  It's good to be prepared.  It turns out that eating well and exercising have paid off.  Soon after checking into lovely Room 228, I became quite popular.  Most of these would-be suitors didn't suit me, but I made a huge point of turning them down in the least derisive, friendliest, "so kind of you to offer" voice and facial demeanor.  It's just good tubs karma, I think.  There were even a couple of guys I turned down that, after they'd left my doorway, I thought to myself, "Are you crazy?  He was SO out of your league and you turned him down?"  But it just wasn't what I was looking for.  What I was looking for was some kind of chemistry.  Some form of being appreciated for who and what I am, even though it would mostly be on the most superficial levels.  And the fact is, with some Monster Hot Guy I'd be trying to be something else and spending a little too much time fearing the ultimate rejection, which feelings necessarily feuling the ultimate rejection.  Another time for Monster Hot, that trolley occasionally stops at my door and I can hop on when I'm feeling saucier.  Maybe I've thought too much about it all, or maybe my instincts in this are excellent, but what I wanted was to see myself flashed in someone's eyes instantly in the same way they did in mine.  While the Monster Hot Brigade  liked  me, there was a little sizing up before the decision was made.  I had no time for sizing up, I needed gut reaction (Jesus, gut reaction in the eyes...please, Blogdom, bring your metaphors to me...let me mix 'em just the way you like 'em).  I knew there was an outside chance that I wouldn't find that, but there would be plenty of time for settling if need be.  That time came quickly.  I grew impatient.  I played briefly with a guy who was sexy but wasn't connecting entirely.  And he wouldn't kiss.  Daddy needs to be kissed.   Next !  Then I fooled around with a guy I had eyed around town for awhile who was fun, but not quite it.  He did bring an offering, however, and after removing all traces of powder residue from his key, I was wide awake and ready for chemistry.  I decided a shower would be a nice, soothing activity to cleanse the palate (and whatever else needed cleansing).  The water not only felt great but I wasn't the least bit self-conscious showering out in the open (and, really, these showers are like Your Grocers' Freezer...everyone comes by to do their browsing and they ain't subtle about it).  And towelling off it happened.  The eyes, the sparks, the tingle.  He was moving out of the locker room and I was moving toward the sauna to dry off a bit more, but I figured, hey, let him get ahead a little...it'll give him the illusion of being chased.  Mistake!  It actually took a good 15 - 20 minutes to find him again, but when we both turned the corner and saw each other we were focused on each other's eyes and our hands found nipples and shoulders and things.  He did something rare then, he introduced himself.  Names, as you might imagine, are not always exchanged at the West Side Club.  He offered his right up (Richard) and wanted to know mine.  Cool.  Definitely interested.  We proceeded to the recessed lighting and percale sheets of Room 228.  This was exactly what I'd come for.  Great kisser, attentive, creative, into me as much as I was into him, not in a rush, no script.  And the Brain Additive (which Richard offered me a bit more of later) was working its wonders.  It was also blurring the lines a little.  Not that I need drugs to do that, mind you, but they do give you something better to blame than human frailty.  You see, besides just enjoying Richard's body and attention, I started to fantasize a little about Richard's future.  I'd think to myself, "He's well-spoken...at least I could introduce him to my friends."  And then, "I bet we look kinda hot together...that would look good on Eighth Avenue."  I'd have moments where I felt indescribable tenderness for this stranger.  Or think, "I wonder if we'll laugh about meeting here."  Now, before the serious eye-rolling starts, tell me you don't do that.  Just a little.  It's the nature of good chemistry.  As humans we want to extend those good, connected feelings.  Even when it's just sex with a stranger.  Just for a fraction of a night, you fall in love with that person.  His touch or his mouth, his eyes or the way he holds you or lets you hold him.  And, oh man, I did.  It was wonderful.  I let myself float a little on that cloud and it did me a world of good.  Because it allowed me to allow a living, breathing man into my very personal space, not caring about how much rent I owe or how much dog hair there is under my bed.  It allowed be to be appreciated solely for the man I was at  that moment , appreciated for the pleasure I was bringing and to receive pleasure in return.  To hold onto a stranger so tight that it  should  hurt but does only the reverse.  I was wildly in love with Richard for a night, and he was in love with me.  We were together for a couple of hours, switching rooms and taking shower and pee breaks.  It was never less than mutually satisfying and fun.  I think the degree to which the chemistry flowed surprised and delighted us both.  He asked for my number and I gave it to him (but I don't really expect to hear from him).  We talked about maybe leaving together and going to one of our apartments to continue, but the logistics didn't really work out.  So we parted.  And I was okay with it.  Whenever we'd pass each other in the hallway or by one of our rooms, it was like we were co-conspirators.  Or very sophisticated lovers.  We'd chat a bit, or duck into a room and makeout or something.  At one point, Richard introduced me to someone he'd been talking to.  "Charlie, this is David.  David has a twelve-inch dick."  I chuckled a little, while Richard quietly assessed my interest in David and whether he might join us for a romp.  I wasn't all that interested in David, so I just said, "I'm gonna take a little stroll.  I'll stop by in a bit and you can tell me if David's telling the truth."  He was happy, I was happy, and, knowing how talented Richard is, I have no doubt that David was happy.  It didn't hit me in my self-esteem, I didn't feel jilted (as ridiculous as the thought of that might sound), and I still felt connected.  In whatever superficial way (although I'd give you an argument on just how superficial), my needs had been met, my emotional wells had been filled, and I was comfortable.  Everything's in the same place as yesterday:  all the bills, all the decisions, all the worry.  But last night I was held tightly and kissed properly by someone who cared about me while he was doing it.  I fell a little bit in love.  And I'm calmer for it today.  Now I ask you: is that so wrong?

       The  Other  White Meat  I was distracted last night.  I was also slightly overcaffeinated.  But still distracted.  Very, very short attention span.  So it was probably a bad idea to go meet the kids at The Lure for Pork.  But I get a kick outta  urlLink Jonathan  and  urlLink David , and it's always a party when  urlLink Sparky's  there (alcohol or no), and we got the added bonus of  urlLink Bryan  and his beau Daniel (the Clubberati).  So I went anyway.  It was so hot yesterday, and I was so sweaty and miserable, that when I got to The Evil Empire I slammed back several ice cold Diet Cokes.  The buzz began.  Later, when I got down to Chelsea, I realized it was far too early to arrive at Pork, so I stopped and got some hot coffee...the perfect thing for a sweltering night.  All in all, it didn't help my focus, but I marched bravely on to The Lure.  The Lure is an odd place.  It means to be rough and edgy, but never quite gets there.  The promise is always greater, but sometimes the promise is all you need.  Last night's pool party theme didn't exactly help their edge factor, either (it was a little like The Addams Family Visits ClubMed).  But I still like the place.  Since it's smack in the middle of the Meat Packing District (or as one  urlLink wag  put it last night, the "Fudge Packing District"), it's all cinderblock and brick and chain link, mostly painted black, dimly lit.  The bartenders are rough and cinderblocky, too, generally in some sort of fetish wear and mostly not as a costume (for instance, the older guy with the mousetraps on his nipples isn't doing it just for the tips).  The crowd isn't so pretty, and I say that as a good thing.  There's slightly less body fascism, and much more furriness than other Chelsea bars.  Guys tend to look (and smell) like guys, and I'm all for that.  And as opposed as I normally am to guys just walking around shirtless in a bar (usually it just seems like they're trying too hard), in The Lure it seems right.  Boys' clubby and kinda hot.  The cruising seems more direct, the posturing is almost always making a point.  Now as to the  L eather  U niform  R ubber  E tc. that gives the Lure it's name, I'm not sure.  There've been nights it's seemed like just a different kinda drag bar, and nights I was wondering in what dungeon I'd be shackled come daybreak.  It's tough to tell.  Who's in the scene, who's in costume?  There's technically a door policy, which used to be strictly applied:  No sneakers, no shirts with collars, no cologne, etc.  It's become fairly lax, mostly I guess due to the fact that until The Eagle reopens in September, this is the only place to go when this is the kind of place you wanna go.  I think they oughta stick to their dress code.  When you've got a taste for a dank bar with rough corners and you're faced with the reality of a guy in a yellow button down and madras shorts, it dampens the dankness.  Why go there and not take part in the spirit of it?  I think everyone there is flirting to some degree or another with fetish sex.  Strategically placed armbands and hankies leave their clues, but don't tell the entire story.  Having been there with friends who are very much into the B&D scene, I learned that with a very short interview they can discern who's playing dress-up and who wants to get dressed-down.  I'm always too aware that I could get myself cast in a role I won't know how to play, but that's never become a reality.  And the times I've left there with someone (or a couple someones) it hasn't ended in disappointment or too many unwanted bruises.  Given all of that, it isn't a particularly great place to chat with friends and catch up on good conversation at the best of times, but given my attention disorder last night, it was even worse.  I apologize boys.  The odd thing is, I don't know what I was looking for.  Nothing, probably.  I didn't particularly want sex, although I did want to be chatted up and I probably wouldn't have minded making out (as long as there was no mention of dead boyfriends).  I know I wanted a little attention, but my pals were very attentive and still I couldn't focus for longer than a minute or two.  I wore a blank tanktop that I alternately loved and hated; sometimes wishing I had sleeves to hide behind, sometimes thinking I was pretty beefy.  I made eye contact a few times, especially with a shorter guy in a sleeveless shirt who was definitely munchy, but even that couldn't hold me for long.  I did a couple of love laps, but wasn't moved to action.  I suppose I was looking for something external to anchor me, when I should be doing that for myself.  It probably reads like a neon sign, too.  I guess it's just a concentrated form of what I'm feeling about my life in a larger sense.  Change has got to happen and I'm ready to make it, but the timing and circumstances prevent it at the moment.  So I'm a caged animal, pacing back and forth and looking out through the bars (and the irony is at The Lure I could do that quite literally).  I can pack my belongings up in boxes, but I can't take them anywhere...and where is it I'm going anyway?  I could start looking for a different job, if I'm not moving, but I can't do that until I come back from my road trip.  It's causing me to be restless and unsettled.  I guess that's what's at the bottom of all this; feeling like I'm a hologram in the landscape of my life.  I can see me there from certain angles, I look three dimensional, but I can see right through me.  I need some solidity.  I need some stability.  I need to feel like I'm not just dressing up for my life, I'm really a part of it.  After several aborted attempts, I finally left with Sparky.  There was a light rain, which we both agreed felt great, and we ambled up to the subway.  I reluctantly left the most delightful Sparkster at the L train and headed up Eighth Avenue a couple of blocks.  I hailed a cab, I opened the door, and I realized I was still so highly caffeinated that it was pointless for me to go home and try to sleep.  So I checked that my hand had been stamped, sent the taxi on its way, and marched myself back to The Lure.  Imagine the confused faces of my cronies to see me return.  They agreed that I was a little wired and were even accepting of it (although Bryan did make me show him the drug pocket of my jeans to prove I really wasn't on something stronger).  I had another Citron, we chatted and cruised a bit more ( urlLink some of us  definitely  more ), and I wracked my brain for a better venue for Our British Cousins.  But Wednesday night in Manhattan really means Pork or Salon Wednesdays at Flamingo East.  Or...Splash.  I'm sorry to say that's where they ended...or mostly ended.  I walked the boys to 17th Street then actually got into a cab and went home to walk young Dex, who was happy to see me and cared not about my state of caffeination.  I was already yawning by this time, but it still took a Unisom to knock me out.  Today I feel like I have slightly stronger powers of concentration, but also slightly stronger cravings for attention.  Possibly even sex (if it means I'll get attention, too).  The Blogging Bandwagon is off to see  urlLink Troy  perform tonight, which I'd certainly enjoy, but I won't get out of work in time and I think they need a night off from me anyway.  But I know 10:30's gonna roll around and I'm gonna feel itchy to be noticed and I'll head out somewhere...    I wonder what The Lure's like on a Thursday night?

       Ghost In The Machine  God.  I should be telling you about The Seagull in the Park.  How exciting to have Mike Nichols hop up onstage to do a short introduction of the dress rehearsal.  How stunning it was to see Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline weaving around each other onstage, comfortable and playful and intense.  How satisfying it was to sit outside on a beautiful New York night watching a play in the hands of so many skilled and famous actors, surrounded by so many skilled and famous actors.  How disconcerting it was a little, too.  But I don't really feel like writing about it and I'll bet you don't really feel like reading about it.  And I really should be telling you about the big TransAtlantic Blogmeet last night.  How charming and fun and funny and smart  urlLink Jonathan  and  urlLink David  are  (how could you not adore someone who shouts out "It's the blogs that got small!").  How great it was to see  urlLink RJ  and  urlLink Sparky , to finally have an intimate chat with  urlLink Troy , trade barbs with spicy  urlLink Michael  , tease  urlLink Jeff , torment  urlLink Bryan .  How I drank waaaay too much vodka and made out with an old acquaintance because he said, "you look so great and my boyfriend and I broke up" followed by "we didn't really break up, he died."  Oh.  Umm.  Sure, let's make out.  How when we were at the height of intoxication it sounded really, really funny to compare bloggers to snowflakes.  I had a swell time, but everybody else has written about it and, if you weren't there you really just wanna see the picture and move on, right?  Me too.  I think I mean to be telling you about crashing the Big Orange Bike today.  Cracked the frame.  Totalled it.  Gone.  Bye bye.  R.I.P. B.O.B.  But I don't have a scratch to show for it and, other than having to walk away from him at the bike shop where they were gonna strip him for parts, it wasn't that traumatic, I guess.  I can't believe I'm not gonna have my rides down the Hudson anymore, but it's almost too hot for it now anyway.  I'll be off on my road trip soon and when I get back I'll have to move, so it's just one less thing to distract/pack.  Maybe I don't wanna tell you about the Big Orange Bike.  I feel like I'm walking in space.  I'm unconnected to anything.  I can connect briefly to people or activities, but mostly I'm adrift and sooner rather than later I'm back floating in the middle of my life, not touching the edges.  I suppose it's depression, still, but it's never felt this way before.  What I'd really like is for someone who knows me really well, someone who has no advice necessarily, someone who just thinks I'm groovy and loveable to just hold me for a really long time.  And for once, to my horror, I don't even need it to be sexual.  I want someone to be my connection to the Earth and to care about me and maybe take care of me for a little bit and tell me it's gonna be okay even if it may not be.  But that's, realistically, not gonna happen anytime soon.  There isn't anyone like that in my life.  I'm alone.  I'm in this alone.  And I'm in space.  I have to say it's not entirely unpleasant, it just doesn't seem entirely real.  I'm used to a little more reality in my real life.  It's like I'm a ghostly presence in my own life and while I can take part in things, enjoy them even, there's a little detachment, too.   So I sit and watch this mind blowing theatrical experience, but at intermission and after the show, I feel like no one can see me, I can walk in amongst the crowd of people, people I know, without causing any effect.  I felt a little like this last night.  I'd talk to people, really enjoying their conversation, but always aware that I'd evaporate soon and I'd need to move on before that happened.  I crashed my beloved bike this morning, then walked it to the bike shop -- I knew they were going to tell me it couldn't be fixed -- and left it sitting there without looking back, without even really thinking about it too much.  Am I just crazy?  Is it the heat?  I'm confused.

       Saturday Morning Flashback  I think one of the reasons I've enjoyed dropping acid is that, as an adult, it's the closest I can come to reliving the childhood trippiness I got from  urlLink Sid & Marty Krofft .  This may come as a surprise to you, but I was a strange child.  No,  really !  For instance, I loved, loved,  loved  puppets.  A lot.  I had quite a few and we'd have these endless, drama-packed, Byzantine adventures (that I'm sure several child psychologists and early child development experts would like transcripts of).  So imagine my absolute delirium when one Saturday morning while turning the dial (yes, dial...we actually had to touch the TV in those days) and just feeling the rush from my bowl of  urlLink Quisp , I stumbled across a friend that would change my life from that day forward:   urlLink H.R. Pufnstuf .  My little brain melted.  It was too, too fabulous.   I  wanted a talking dragon-like friend who was mayor of his own island where everything talked,  I  wanted a  urlLink talking golden flute ,  I  wanted to be stalked by a  urlLink wacky Witchiepoo !  I was glued to the television, singing the songs and soaking up the lessons (there really  ain't  no rhyme for oranges).  And the minute it was over, I was out of the house, roaming the neighborhood trying to find a way off Living Island, keeping my eyes peeled for Witchiepoo's henchmen who only wanted to get their grubby hands on my golden talking flute (first one of you smartasses who mentions Freud gets kicked down a flight of stairs).  I was almost always Jimmy, sometimes Puf, but any poor soul who got coerced into playing with me only had hopes of being a secondary character.  Poor Wendy Corso from next door really thought she had a chance of being Jimmy one afternoon...her contract was promptly cancelled.  I sent her back to her  urlLink Julia  coloring book (until she got that  urlLink Easy-Bake oven , and then we were friends again, until I got  urlLink Incredible Edibles , then I didn't need her...).  All sorts of inanimate objects began talking to me and I'd often bring them up into my favorite climbing tree on the corner of Plymouth Street.  The neighbors probably pitied my mother for having such an idiot child.  They didn't know she was Witchiepoo.  As is the way with these things, Pufnstuf was just the gateway.  Soon I was narrowly evading  urlLink Sleestaks , smuggling  urlLink Sea Monsters , battled  urlLink Hoo Doo  for control of the magic ring, and very, very briefly joined forces with  urlLink Electra Woman  (all it took for that to end was Wendy's brother, Mark, to ask what I was playing and then pound me into the ground -- I sure did like the cape, though).  I'm proud to say I never succumbed to  urlLink The Bugaloos .  Even then I knew they didn't have enough edge for me.  They were just  too  faggy.  And so I was warped by way too much time alone, an overactive imagination, and the psychodelic thought waves transmitted through the television into my eager mind by the Messrs. Krofft.  It lives with me still.  I don't have to tell you that I'm still trying to keep at bay those evil forces who are after my golden talking flute.  And whenever I'm out at a big club and I'm presented by a large, glazed-eyed creature lumbering towards me, I always think, "Sleestak!"  Just the other day, I was in the elevator with three big-haired, gum-smacking Jersey girls who were going on and on, much too loudly, about bikini waxing.  When they finally got out at their floor and the door closed, I accidentally said out loud, " urlLink I hate those Bugaloos !"  The remaining passengers just blinked at me, but I enjoyed it.  Which brings me to another point: for the sake of my sanity and any hope of a future, I've added to my dating criteria "must have experienced H.R. Pufnstuf in its original run."  I know that's gonna limit my dating pool, but I think it's important to have similar psychic damage...  I feel sorry for the kids today.  I was watching a little TV this morning and all of this "Digimon" and "Pokemon" and "Rusty the Boy Robot."  It's all so cold.  Where's the fantasy?  Where's the wacky hijinks?  Where's the acid-flashbacky pedophiliac dragon-thingy and his drag queen nemesis?  Sid & Marty, save the youth!

       Splendor In The Grass  "You know I love you very much, don't you?"  He looked at me for a long moment, deciding just how serious I was, then gave my nose a quick, perfunctory lick and bounded over me, each of four paws landing either on face, windpipe, chest or stomach, to where his ball was.  Although it was just sitting there, he pounced on it like a jungle animal, batting it with his paws, and it took about 8 seconds before he was hogtied by his leash and plopped back into the grass with a sigh, with a little flash in his eyes that said "I meant to do that."  I've spent too many hours worrying about the quality of Dex's life, and how having a dog in the city has hindered mine, but then we have a couple of hours like this afternoon and I can't imagine living without him.  In fact I start thinking about creating the kind of life where he could have a backyard and maybe a lake to swim in.  Not for me, for  him .  He gives me something outside of myself to care about, both concretely and abstractly, every day.  He's a warm body in bed; he's someone to talk to so I don't seem like a crazy person talking to myself; he misses me when I'm gone and he's always glad to see me when I'm back; when he puts his head on my lap, I relax completely, looking down as I type this he's laying at my feet and I feel cozy and kinda secure.  A sense of stability, I guess that's what it is.  I give him kibble and he gives me normalcy.  And, as weird as this may sound, he makes me laugh.  He tilts his head, furrows his brow and tries to understand me, or he thinks he's getting away with something and shoots me a nonchalant glance over his shoulder, or he chases his tail like a dervish (I know that's cliche, but you haven't seen  Dex  do it).  He's such a beautiful boy, and so smart, that I'm always proud walking down the street with him.  It's not an earthshaking blog, I just really love my dog right now and I had to tell you.

      Is this what it's like to be old?  I'm not yet, I know that.  But the effort that it takes to move from my bed to the kitchen.  From the kitchen to the living room.  To get back up from the sofa.  Is it that I just can't shake the sleep?  That I don't want to change states from dreaming to waking?  I don't feel depressed, I have things I'm looking forward to, but every move I make is like swimming in syrup.  Slow.  Effort.  Tiring.  I manage to get to the gym, but my strength has decreased.  I refuse to go through the motions so I push my body and that feels good.  Right.  But the energy isn't sustained.  It drains.  I'm drained.  And every other sentence I type seems slow.  Old.  Rehashed.  So much I want to say, so little I want to listen to.  I'm neutral.  In neutral.  Lying in bed (but it's not the only place I lie) I think about strength of will.  Can't I will myself out of bed at 9am?  Can't I will the energy?  Perhaps, but it takes practice and practice takes time.  And effort.  I think it'll pass, and I have to believe it will.  Like an old person, I feel the younger inside, stirring, eager to accomplish.  But the heavy, wet, woolen overcoat prevents swift movement, or any movement.  The heat slows me down.  So much easier to fall into that narcoleptic state which, at least, prevents my worrying about it.

      Last night I dreamt of the fields behind my grandfather's house in Virginia.  They extended in two directions.  North led to a pond and towards the kennels where my grandfather kept his hunting dogs, angry animals considered property not friends and they knew it.  In the other direction, at the farthest end of his property, was the newest house, a house my grandfather had built for his daughter, my Aunt Emily, but she had long since freed herself from the tragedies that had been heaped upon her and deserted this house and most of this family.  Now it's inhabitant was my Great Aunt Leila, my dead grandmother's oldest sister.  Now this house contained a Siamese cat named Smokey, stacks of newspaper either read and saved or yet-to-be-read (I never knew), a huge blue Bonneville in the garage, incongruous antiques in the new rooms, almost always sugar cookies with M&Ms baked into them, but most importantly for me an adult who looked at me with bright blue eyes and keen interest, something I found nowhere else on that vast farm on Taylor Road.  In my dream, as always on those summer days, I found myself at the edge of the field, gathering my courage to cross it.  The corn that was planted here was high enough that I couldn't see over to Aunt Leila's, but I knew in which direction I had to run.  Oh, and I had to run.  Because I imagined there were snakes, or worse, waiting within -- not that I'd ever seen them.  I was encouraged by my father, who's own house was on the opposite side of all of this land (it would've been even further had my grandfather been able to arrange that), to go without shoes, on the premise it would toughen me up and, in general, I enjoyed the rich, dark Chesapeake soil under my tender city boy feet.  Crossing this terrifying field, though, it made me more vulnerable.  First I surveyed the corn, looking as far into the brown and green stalks as I could.  I had to be careful not to knock over any of the stalks, as my grandfather had an almost psychic connection to them and, of course, corn was worth more to him than grandsons.  Especially the issue of his worthless son.  I also had to make sure that the crazy hired hand we were warned about wasn't lurking within.  This may've been the Taylor Road version of the boogey man meant to keep us in line, but I couldn't be too careful.  Next several incantations meant to protect me on my run.  And, of course, the promise of Aunt Leila at the end.  It was hot in my dream, I was wearing just a pair of cut-off shorts, the kind my mother would never have let me be seen in at home, but no one here cared.  No one here cared.  I knew that without a shirt I was liable to get scratched up, but I didn't care.  It wasn't worth it to go all the way back for a shirt, all that mattered was getting to Aunt Leila's.  And so with heart beating, I let go a big breath and plunged into the field.  I ran longer than I ever had.  And I turned, which I knew I shouldn't because that would bring me out in the wrong place.  The corn got higher, the rows of collards that I knew were on the other end didn't come, but I ran.  I corrected my course, but I wasn't sure if I was really running in the right direction now and I started to panic but I couldn't stop.  Snakes.  Hired Hands.  It seemed to be getting dark.  I wanted to cry but I couldn't open my mouth to do it.  And all at once I pushed out of the corn and I was at the edge of Aunt Leila's yard.  But it was years later.  I'm not sure how I knew, but now I was in high school.  My grandfather had died and we'd come back to Cheseapeake and Taylor Road to bury him.  Staying at Aunt Leila's house.  It was dark and I was alone in the yard, and the long run was forgotten.  I wasn't tired, just confused at how I'd gotten here from there and I thought I'd better get inside before anyone missed me.  Across the cool lawn, still with no shoes, the dew soothing my feet, I stepped up onto the porch, through the front door, and into an empty house.  The stacks of newspaper were there, the odd antiques, but no people, no family.  Had they left for the funeral without me?  Had I waited to long to cross the field and forced them to leave me there?  I remember next showing up at the funeral home.  Not a grand old Southern Gothic place, this was closer to a plain, seventies-modern establishment.  No one was there, either.  I realized stepping into the chapel where my grandfather's body lay in state that I wasn't my high school self any longer, I was me now, 38, yet still shy and a little afraid of asking my father for what I wanted.  And what I wanted was my grandfather's Mason's ring.  There the three of us were, three men who misunderstood each other almost completely with practically no love to go around and yet connected in the most intimate way.  Three men who knew nothing of each other except who we'd come from.  No interest in where we were going.  Yet I wanted to hold onto a piece of it and I asked for the ring.  My father showed no surprise, no understanding of it, but said he'd try.  He'd try.  Is that what he said when the real event took place?  Did I mishear him?  Did he even respond back then?  I thought he said he'd try.  We drove to the cemetary.  In the dream this happened at night, although I know we buried him in the afternoon.  I waited in the dream as I waited over 20 years ago for that moment when my father would present a token of his past to his future.  But that moment never came in waking life and it didn't come now.  Then I was back at the field.  It had been burnt.  The odd cornstalk still stood, but the deep brown earth was black and I could see straight across it.  It wasn't far at all, in fact it seemed such a short distance back to my grandfather's house.  I began my gearing-up process out of habit, but stopped short when I looked down at my feet.  I was wearing shoes.  I didn't remember putting them on, they didn't seem like my own, but they fit.  And I stood there wondering why I needed to cross at all.

       From The Pages of  Vague Magazine    VIRGO (Week of July 12, 2001) During the next six months, I vow to prove to you that astrology is neither a science that can pinpoint the precise path of your evolution, nor an irrational belief system that obliterates your free will. Instead, I intend to show that it's a profound art form that can guide your choices by illuminating the hidden and unconscious factors at work in your life. As for what empowering promises you might make to yourself in the second half of 2001, Virgo, I'll suggest that the best way to begin will be to give up your attraction to crystalline certainty. The rest of the year will be about learning to love and thrive on ambiguity, not just tolerate it. Your challenge will be to make confident decisions without relying on tried-and-true formulas.   Ummm,  hello ?  Thrive on ambiguity?  Could you be more specific please?  Virgo with exploding head here.  And while I wouldn't say no to crystal, crystalline certainty went out the window the first time ConEd shut off my power. I guess it makes sense considering what the inside of my apartment looks like right now.  I have boxes packed for storage, I have stacks of things for charity ( not   urlLink The Salvation Army , thankyouverymuch), stacks of things I need to take digital pictures of to auction off, stacks of things to sell at an apartment sale, stacks of things that belong to the ex (although he moved out over six years ago), furniture that should be returned to the street from whence it came, and all in preparation for what?  Don't ask me.  The question has become comical here in midtown.  The various answers to "Why are you packing up your apartment?" have been thus:    I've got to get my things in storage in case I get tossed out by the Marshalls.    I've got to move, I can't afford this place, I've had it!    I'm getting ready for my move to Chicago.    I'm looking for an apartment with my friend Jon.    I'm moving to the East Village.    I'm looking for an apartment in the East Village with my friend Jon.    'Cause I need to sort out my life.    So my surviving relatives will have an easy time picking through my belongings.    I'm getting ready for my move to Chicago.  No really.    I went to Broooklyn and it didn't seem bad and so I'm thinking...    I'm simplifying.    In case I accidentally move to New Orleans.    'Cause I already started.  Another day in Suite 1304 of Ambiguity Arms.  By the way, all of those answers were at some point absolutely true, and several remain true.  I don't know where I'm headed and I don't even have much of a plan except that every day I pack and sort a little bit more, every week I try to make a little more cash, and every night I tell myself (and finally believe) that even though I don't know what the way out of this is, there  is  one and any effort I put into nailing it down exactly knocks out the possibility of something far better that I haven't dreamed up that the Spiritual Board of Directors might have in store.  Wherever I end up it'll be new and kinda exciting.  And as God as my witness they're not going to lick me. I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over I'll never be hungry again. No, nor any of my folk. If I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill; as God as my witness,  urlLink I'll never be hungry again !    While I don't yet love it, as Rob predicts, this state of not knowing isn't hideous.  As  urlLink Edna Ferber  said about middle age:  It's a lot like death by drowning -- really a delightful sensation after you've ceased struggling.

       Triskaidekaphobia   I only have a mild case of it, but days like today tend to bring it out in folks.  Since I live on the 13th Floor in a city where elevators skip from 12 to 14, I'm just not as fazed by it anymore.  However, this morning when I woke up at 11:15am and realized I was supposed to be at work at 9am, I had a relapse.  The dog hadn't been walked or fed (and he was almost out of food), I didn't get a chance to shower or iron a shirt (thank goddess for  urlLink this stuff ...does it work around one's eyes?), and any sort of breakfast was out of the question.  Mercifully I had a stray can of Diet Coke in the fridge to start my heart.  Fuckin' Friday the 13th!  The saddest part of all is, when I strolled in at 11:45am no one noticed that I was almost three hours late.  So maybe 13 isn't so bad after all.  Or maybe it's just trying to lull me into a false sense of security so I'll relax, go out tonight and have a couple of drinks, and stumble across ex-boyfriends making out with the  urlLink Brewer Twins .  Whatever.  I'm unafraid.  Maybe I'll find the  urlLink Carlson Twins ...  I have nothing planned this weekend but eating protein bars and working out.  It worries me only because my idle brain is truly the Devil's Playground and I'm apt to get into more trouble than I should.  All the more to report here, I guess.  But never mind about me.  To  urlLink Todd :  Break a leg!  You don't need Razzle Dazzle, you've got that smile...  If you're in Cleveland, go see  Chicago , opening tonight.  To  urlLink Richard :  "Nimm meine aufrichtigen Wunsche entgegen"  Break a nail!  If you're in New Orleans, go see  urlLink Hedwig , opening tonight.  and  To  urlLink Holden Caulfield's Lover :  Bon voyage!  Can't wait for further tales of Arizona and marital bliss...  If you're in Milwaukee, the best show in town is closing this weekend...  That is all.  Please resume your normal lives.

       Something Is Stirring, Shifting Ground  I woke up at noon.  Okay, that's a lie.  I woke up at nine, but the air conditioner had conditioned the air so nicely and Dexter had literally plopped himself on top of me with a big sigh, so we figured just a few more minutes couldn't hurt and they didn't.  The last hour brought a couple of odd dreams, one involving me being placed in a tank of water by a hypnotist who resembled  urlLink Anne Robinson , where I was to turn somersaults as part of my therapy, and then she dropped in the "glass needle" which in reality looked like a solid sterling silver hypodermic, but whatever, it wasn't unpleasant.  Finally we looked at each other and decided we might as well have breakfast, so we got up, took Little Mister outside, and back up for breakfast.  I have to say, the  urlLink Eight O'Clock  Dark Roast I'm now forced to drink (since it's about $7 cheaper than Starbucks' beans) is actually tasty.  A little fat free half 'n' half and some Sweet 'N' Low and it's heaven in a cup.  It's definitely enough to get me up and out.  Out for a good, hard ride on the Big Orange Bike, I realized that I ride by the Hudson but I usually look at the City.  That's crazy.  I mean, it's a different view than usual and the buildings are, for the most part, older and interesting, but if I just swivel my noggin in the opposite direction there's a river.  Sparkly water.  Sailboats.  Tugs.  Cute boys kayaking.  I didn't slow down, but I did relax a little.  I let my shoulders come down from my ears for a bit and felt that breeze that's sometimes a little too hot but today was sweet and a little salty.  Is the Hudson salty?  Must be a little, huh?  And up near Chambers Street, turning toward  urlLink Tribeca Park , I looked across at the Statue of Liberty and got giddy at the idea of people coming from all over for a glimpse of her and I get her on an incidental bike ride.  I turned back, passing two very hot joggers, some slow moving tourists that I didn't yell at, Matthew Modine, and a nun in full blue and white habit steering her bike with one hand and going at the rosary with the other.  Swear to God!  I didn't bring my walkman today, so I sang to myself, swerving and cutting my bike around cracks in the pavement, around tourists and traffic cones.  I pulled into the  urlLink gym  for a  urlLink liquid lunch , then headed home.  Greeted Dex, who trotted behind me as I went to weigh myself.  Dropped 4lbs and there's a little upper ab action (very little) trying to pop out.  New Orleans here I come!  I looked down at Dex and really noticed for the first time in days just how adorable he is.  One of those big ears was sticking straight up, the other flopped over and he had that wrinkled, concerned look, as if he was saying, "I can almost make out what you're saying...I think one more Snausage would help my perception."  I sank to the floor for a little scratchy session and then popped in the shower.  I love me some  urlLink Dr. Bronner !  Nothing keeps you cool and tingly like peppermint Castile soap.  As a matter of fact, you have to be careful to keep some parts from tingling longer than you'd like.  There was some Rosemary Mint shampoo left, and a little of that great  urlLink Kiehl's  Body Scrub.  So clean you could eat off me!  Started to shave then realized I wanna grow a little bikery mustache thingy, so I just shaved around it.  And it doesn't make me look too Spic-y.  Kiss the Dex, grab my Palm and head off to The Evil Empire, where it's so quiet I have time to read some blogs and answer some email (The  urlLink British  Are  urlLink Coming !).  Had a swell chat with my co-worker, Eileen, who's beautiful and about to get married.  Even discussed the possibility of moving away for a year or so to get my financial house in order and maybe write.  This time the discussion didn't feel to me as though I were running away from something, more like repairing psysche and credit and taking a break from this City.  And I might as well do it now, huh?  It felt good to talk about it and I even outed myself to her about my blog.  Of course she wanted the link, but I'm not ready for  that  yet...  That brings me to right now.  It's quiet.  I just had a S'mores Solid Protein Bar.  I'm content.  It feels odd.  My blogs are better when I'm miserable...don't worry, tomorrow's Friday the 13th.  Something rotten's bound to happen, huh?

       Good Times and Bum Times, I've Seen Them All And, My Dear...  I'm fascinated by theatre ghosts.  Every old theatre I've ever worked in has a ghost and, usually, a good story to go with it.  One of my favorites growing up was the Falk Theatre where the residence ghost, Bessie (a jilted vaudevillian), used to play pranks on us like moving heavy furniture from dressing room to dressing room after the theatre was closed at night.  She was a little creepy, but I always felt sad for her, if the stories were true.  Jilted by a lover who met someone new, replaced Bessie in the act with the new girl and moved on to the Big Time without her.  And poor Bessie hung herself and had to remain forever in Tampa.  There but for People's Express went I...    I guess that's part of the attraction of Sondheim's musical  urlLink Follies .  Each one of the old showgirls is followed throughout the show by her younger self, each ghost six-foot tall, in the dazzling costume of her heyday.  But both exist in the same time.  The ghosts as interested in what they've become as the old gals are in recapturing a bit of what they were.  It's heartbreaking.  And fascinating to see these women, weighed down by time and gravity, older, heavier, less agile and vocal powers weakened, and yet still with the girlish glimpses of their past.  The lids are heavier but the eyes sparkle just the same.  And this is true of not just the characters, but the actresses portraying them.  Like the ghosts trapped inside the theatre, their youthful spirit lives inside of them, trapped by mortality and human frailty.  There's so much in this show about how our  version  of past events can wreck our future.  The roads not taken and why.  Regrets.  Survival.  I felt the show wash over me.  At intermission I stood out on 44th Street and tried not to cry, because I could feel my ghosts stirring, rehearsing for a show they wanted to present to me.  But this isn't a tragedy, it's a cautionary tale.  There's hope, too.  And the ability to change, in spite of your perceived mistakes.  Arguably the most famous song from Follies is " urlLink I'm Still Here ," sung by Carlotta (and nailed to the back wall by Polly Bergen), is the "been there, done that" song of the night.  Unvarnished.  And being the unabashed show queen that I am, I knew she was singing right to me (well, she  was ).  Christ on a casting couch, I'm an idiot!  Why didn't anyone tell me this before?  My life is swell.  I'm not selling  urlLink ColorTile  in Clearwater like Lenny from high school.  I'm not some closeted fag in New Port Richie married to the least-threatening girl I ever dated, like Jerry.  I'm in New York, trying to do what I always said I wanted to.  I haven't settled.  I wasn't terrorized into becoming an English teacher, like Lori, because our guidance counselor, Mrs. What's-Her-Butt couldn't conceive of acting as a career.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not on Broadway.  But I've been Off-Broadway.  I've performed my own one-man show, fairly successfully, in Manhattan.  I sing on several CDs (although I would've loved being on vinyl).  I've got a blog.  I kick ass.  Sure, my life's a mess, but I got into this mess 'cause I was making it up as I went along.  And there's not a goddamned thing wrong with that.  I got through all of last year, and I'm here.  What's my problem?  My problem, apparently, is too many ghosts and not enough perspective (okay, that's just  today's  problem...now be quiet).  There are lots of roads and I couldn't possibly take all of them.  Part of the fun of being an actor is that you can try some of those roads, if just for a little while.  Besides, this is the road I want.  I wouldn't have chosen all that differently.  Do I feel the same as I did at 18?  Hell no, much better.  The ghosts of Follies were respectful, even helpful, of their older selves.  I'll bet mine are too, if I look carefully.    As you know, I believe in the transformative powers of Theatre and Blogging, and last night was healing.  I've felt different today.  Mostly happy that I didn't have to sell anyone ColorTile, but still,  different .  Perspective isn't a two hour musical, it takes a little maintenance, and I hope I'm up to it.  Or that I'll find my way back to it.  Either way, it's nice for a little bit to not beat up on myself and, actually, have a little self-respect.  Just a little.    I mean, Lord knows at least I was  there ...and I'm  here . Look who's here. I'm still here!

       Exposure  Wow.  Huh.  Here I've built this little cocoon of anonymity, a little mystery, and the perfect screen from behind which I can write freely, and this weekend blows it all to hell.  Not only is  urlLink my name  being tossed around, so's  urlLink my face .  And to make matters worse,  urlLink someone's  revealing my tawdry sexlife.  Oh, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.  Oz never did give nothin' to the Tinman that he didn't already have.  I worry about this boy.  I'm a Virgo, I overanalyze, I obsess...but this is getting out of hand.  Having read the Tinman's Trials long before I'd met him, I'd always thought, "This boy needs a gay big brother."  And now that we've hung out a couple of times, I've been trying to be just that.  But, ladies and gentlemen, it can be a lot of work.  Here's a sweet, smart, cute boy with a law degree and a lot to offer and he can't let go, can't get out of his own way.  The boy needs adventure!  Excitement!  I had kidded him online about taking him to the West Side Club and tossing him to the sharks, thinking it would startle him, but he was intruiged.  So when we made plans to have cocktails on Saturday, I was prepared to follow-through on my threat if he was still interested.    It's the absolute, startling truth that, in the middle of Fat Cock 29, with Seventies porn and Wonder Woman alternately playing on the big screen, Girlina carrying on in the corner, a bartender in Underoos, and well, Sparky and me in his face, the Tinman nodded off.  I might as well've been on a date!  No one falls asleep on me.  What he didn't mention is that I woke him up by pinching both his nipples (for those of you who're wondering, they're just like real nipples, only smaller).  Dan and I figured a brisk walk and change of venue would help, so we gathered up our young charge (at one point, yes, I literally gathered him up...he pretended to hate it.  What ever , Becky.) and headed to The Cock (my second time there this weekend, both times with Sparky...he's a bad influence...I like him).    Now, it's not the same old Cock.  When the theme was Foxy Saturdays, you'd walk in with a handful of Foxy Dollars and get to dare people to do things for the fake dough, 'cause at the end of the night the person with the most Foxy Dollars got a fistful of real American dollars.  One of the bartenders used to surf the crowd naked.  Unspeakable things were inserted in all manner of improbable places and the raunch in the air was palpable.  It's just not the same.  But until we  urlLink lynch the mayor , it's all we've got.  There were cute boys to chat with (Oh, Vincent...I'll find you again.  Or not.)  A decent, human-looking go go boy.  The backroom wasn't in full swing yet, but the barnacles were beginning to gather on its hull.  But it wasn't enough to pull our Man O' Tin from his funk.  I thought I knew where he  really  wanted to go, but he had to ask ("You've had the power all along").  He finally asked, Sparky declined to join us, and after walking Danny Boy (for whom these pipes were  not  calling) to his glam train, it was Big Brother Night at the West Side Club.   [Okay, side bar.  While looking for a link to the West Side Club, I found the following hilarious results:  West Side 4-H Club, West Side Nut Club in Indiana (close), West Side Athletic Club, West Side Club exclusively catered by Queen Anne Caterers..."a perfect location for your banquet and party needs" (now we're getting somewhere, if they only knew!), West Side Optimists Club, West Side Gymnastics Club, and West Side Dive Club.  The Internet is fun!]   For those of you who've never been (or won't admit to it), the West Side Club is a trashy bathhouse.  No more, no less.  Dimly lit, a maze of rooms, showers, gummy steam room.  There are better, more fabulous, baths all across the country, but the current climate in New York City prevents such things here and so we're left with this place.  I discovered it a few years ago in a fit of rebelliousness following my breakup with Peter (that also involved my slow introduction to recreational drug use).  Don't get me wrong, I was no stranger to casual sex before this, I'd just never been to the Piggly Wiggly of Casual Sex.  Although it has it's own unwritten code of conduct and signals, as I tried to explain to Jeff, it's really no different from going to bars or clubs, etc., the experience is just reduced to its most concentrated form.  No drinks, no black tshirts, no coy conversation...just horny boys in small towels.  This can be good and bad, but mostly it just  is .  I've gone through phases of harsh judgement about the place, but I think I understand it a little better now and I don't need to judge it.  So, you wanna know what I've learned?  Wanna know what this place is?  Get ready:  it's a place to have sex.  That's it.  McDonald's is a place to have burgers and fries, West Side Club is a place to get off.  You go to McDonald's looking for  urlLink Jean-Georges , you're gonna be disappointed.  Same goes for the WSC.  Sounds simple, but it's not.  Because the minute you add gay men to that simple premise, you get fear of rejections, body issues, body fascism, drug use, drug abuse, health issues and risks, guys looking for love (or at least boyfriends) in all the wrong places, language barriers, sexual tunnel-vision, and on and on.  Is that intense glare you're getting desire or dismissal or just the glassy look of a boy who's done one too many bumps?  Is that guy shaking his head "no" at you because he doesn't think you're cute or because he came here to act out some rape fantasy with a big muscle daddy?  Tough to know.  And, just like drugs can do, this intensified queer space generally amplifies whatever mood you come in with.  You think you're walking around with a couple of extra pounds?  Gonna feel like you're dragging a ton around once those sexy, sculpted Chelsea boys stare right through you and walk right by.  Maybe he's not interested or maybe he's rushing back to his room to recover because he was just rejected for having body hair.  Fucked up, ain't it?  But if you go in feeling fun and frisky, if you can keep in your sex-addled forebrain that this is just a naughty romp and nothing more, then you're golden.    I say that like it's an easy thing to do or remember, when I myself have come away from a night of validation-seeking worse off than before.  So I can understand how the Tinman might not have liked the place.  It's not for everyone (I myself made out with a beefy blonde boy for a few minutes, but fighting the effects of a great deal of Southern Comfort I eventually just went home to sleep which I enjoyed very much more).  I'm pleased he had the balls to go and let himself experience it, though.   My real concern is that he's not enjoying  anything  and he's postponing his life because of it.  And what can I do to help?  In my big brotherly fashion I've tried to explain about doing things  in spite of  the fear.  Jump into conversations.  Risk looking foolish.  Find it funny.  I've tried to explain that  everyone  is scared, especially gay boys in bars.  Even the biggest, most beautiful boy in the room is generally apprehensive about approaching someone first.  But, as  urlLink someone  discovered in Paradise, saying "hi" and smiling opens doors you'd never expect.  In Provincetown one year, my boys and I decided we were gonna be the "Hi, How Are Ya! Guys" and what we discovered blew us away.  You're not gonna land everyone you talk to, but the more you just say hi, smile, and keep moving, the easier it gets when you wanna stop and talk a little more.  You relax and get comfortable and you see life's about being available and fun,  that's  what makes you really attractive.  For chrissakes, why else call us  gay !  Oh hell, this isn't about Tinman at all.  The bottom line is I believe that everybody in your life is just a reflection of yourself, as you are of them.  Don't you find that the things that frustrate you most about your friends and acquaintances are really about you?  And as much as I want the Tinman to relax, let go, let fly...this is really a lesson for me.  My worries and concerns and fears and different from Jeff's, but the resulting paralysis is the same.  I'll spare you the "whole world is the West Side Club" analogy and how we all have "little more than white towels to protect us."  (But you know I'm still thinking it.)  On all fronts, I have the fear of being sized up and dismissed.  That fear has never led to anything but bigger, scarier fear.  And too much expectation has only become frustration and disappointment.  Being the "Hi, How Are Ya! Guy" however, has never been anything but fun and affirming.  So...  I'm sure there's a life lesson in there somewhere, but frankly I've gotta go do some cardio followed by a high-protein meal so I can be beautiful and loved.  Work it out yourselves.    Big Gay Brother's watching, though, and he says "Hi, How Are Ya!"

       In Just 55 Days, I Can Make You A Man  Where have I been?  I mean, really, why didn't anyone tell me?  Well, I guess  urlLink some have tried .  But I didn't get.  I never got it until last night.   urlLink Kiki & Herb  Rule The World.  At the very least, they rule my heart.  Until someone else does.  I was nervous, because the build-up was so intense.  What if I wasn't hip enough to get it?  What if  they  didn't like  me ?  But I decided to risk it.  And I knew  urlLink Sparky  would be right there with me.  And not just the Sparkster, but  urlLink Ralph , too (and let me assure you that, blog title aside, he's lacking nothing).  I needn't have worried, Kiki & Herb welcome all.  It's like being hit by a glorious, vintage Greyhound bus and immediately getting high on the fumes.  It's not that I lack the words to describe the experience, it's that I'm too lazy.  Besides, like the Seventies, if you haven't lived through it, it just seems kitschy.  We must've been an especially warm and loving audience, however, because as a final encore we were treated to David Bowie's "Space Oddity."  Ladies and gentlemen: people die.  After my transformative experience I needed more alcohol, so Sparky and Ralphie, some F.O.S. (Friends of Sparky), and I hiked over to The Cock.  One of the F.O.S., Jake, had captured our fancy.  Slim, cute, great smile.  Turned out he's a teacher from San Francisco, here for summer classes and in love with a straight 21-year-old teaching intern, nice but aloof in that West Coast way.  I'd thought him interesting before the show, but his detailed story of his day with the straight 21-year-old was enough of a turn-off that I didn't mind when they left without saying goodnight.  Plenty else to distract at The Cock, anyway.  There was a  urlLink Minx  sighting (and I'm sure he was  delighted  to see us, too).  JSquared and some of his work cronies.  More Citron (although I'm considering a switch to Southern Comfort, any thoughts?).  It was oddly loud and bright last night and, while there was cuteness, I felt not a part of it.  Of course, that might've had to do with the enormous volcanic pimple on my cheek (apparently Puberty was visiting for the weekend and didn't have anywhere better to stay).  Which reminded me how narrowly we had escaped death earlier in the evening, when Kiki threatened to let her head explode like a volcano and cover us all in her glorious lava.  See?  The scattered thoughts linger.  This is Major Tom to Ground Control.  I finally tired of not being hit on and decided at 3am to call it a night.  The Cock's swell, but without sex and drugs it makes me feel dirty.  In the  bad  way.  So I walked the  urlLink Hip   urlLink Brooklynites  to their train and headed west.  On my walk I started thinking about this trip to across the country.  I had been hoping I could make it to Provincetown, at least for a long weekend, until this offer came along.  It would be so good for me.  I could enjoy the party I haven't allowed myself to have all summer, and then spend some quality time with a good friend (possibly our last for awhile), finally see a little more of the U.S. of A. (I've been all over Europe, but America seems so distant), and end up in San Francisco.  When I was so, so depressed a few months ago and comptemplating a move, two of my choices for new hometowns were New Orleans and San Francisco, now I could evaluate them through different eyes.  But what about the cost?  The dog?  The lost work?  Details.  And I have enough time to try to work them out.  So I have 55 days until we leave and I have to get organized:     Find a Dex-friendly dog/apartment sitter.  Probably not too hard to do, since getting the run of an 1,100 square foot midtown apartment complete with adorable boy-magnet is every Young Homo's dream.  And I usually stock the refrigerator as part of my thank you.   urlLink Any takers ?    Stockpile cash.  My goal is simply to not get too much further behind.  I don't think we'll spend the kind of money on the road that I'd spend in Manhattan, we're staying with his brother in Dallas and his father in Arizona and our friends in San Francisco, and he's subsidizing a portion of the rest, so mostly I need to make sure that the money I wouldn't be making while I'm gone (which seems to be a total of six days) I can bank before I leave.  Fortunately, co-workers are suddenly dropping extra shifts on me and, if I'm a very good boy and work very hard, I can maintain my current level of poverty without reaching a new depth and still have a vacation of sorts.    Lose 15 pounds.  More accurately, shift 15 pounds away from my stomach and towards my shoulders.  From now until the end of August, it's  urlLink Peanut Butter Dreams   and  urlLink Yellow Subs .  The only kind of Blueberry Cheesecake and S'mores I'll have are  urlLink this kind .    Create a Southern Decadence costume.  Something whimsical but sexy.  Something sexy but cool.  Something that breathes.  Something with easy access.  Nothing with spandex.    Design a new tattoo.  DR and I are considering new ones, and maybe NOLA is the place.  I'm thinking about (and starting to research) symbols of strength, perhaps Welsh and/or Castilian/Asturiano, to honor my heritage.    Plan our stops.  There's gonna be a lot to cover, maybe the World's Second Largest Pecan will have to go by, well, the wayside.  I'm sure there's more to plan, but this is a start.  I'm gonna get the hell outta New York and cross our great country (right after I cross Bourbon Street).  I'm gonna discover America and maybe myself.  I'm gonna conquer.  The excitement's building.  My body's tingling...wait, maybe that's just the thermogenic.  No, no...it's what Kiki was talking about: it's the innervating tingle of Manifest Destiny!

       That Was Fast...  All I did was innocently ask "what's next?" and today I get a groovy offer.  Not money or an acting gig, but something I need just as much:  a trip.  My friend DR, who's working in Toronto for the summer, is moving to San Francisco at the end of August and he wants me to drive across country with him, all expenses paid (including the return air fare from SF).  Even better, he wants to first drive down via New Orleans and Southern Decadence.  This is amazing news for several reasons:  First, I thought DR had completely lost interest in our relationship.  He's been on the road for the past few years, but we've stayed fairly close, until he finally moved back to New York and promptly lost touch.  Knowing that he wants to spend ten days trapped in a car with me makes me very happy.  I know we'll laugh our asses off, probably have a good cry every day, and party our collective asses off.  And if I have to lose him to the West Coast, at least I'll have this bonding trip with him to hold on to.  Second: New Orleans,  urlLink Southern Decadence , my own glimpse of  urlLink Blogging   urlLink Royalty ...do I have to go on here?  Third, I've always, always, always wanted to drive across country.  I want to see the  urlLink Coat of Many Duck Heads , I want to eat in  urlLink Mammy's Cupboard , chip a tooth on the  urlLink World's Largest Pecan , knock one back with the  urlLink Beer-Drinking Goat , pay my respects to the  urlLink Astrochimp  , buy something pretty at the  urlLink Store Shaped Like A Rock  , finally see that Grand Canyon the Brady Kids made such a fuss over, and, you know I wanna sit in one of the  urlLink Cabazon Dinosaurs  and say, "Everybody's got a Big But, Monique."  Pecan logs, bad coffee, desert, Southfork...it's heaven!  Getting away would be swell.  I'd actually only lose one week of work, and maybe between now and the end of August I can do some overtime, maybe get a stupid part-time job, and make this work.  I'd have to leave Dexter with someone I trust, and Molly's dad certainly owes me, but I'd rather have someone come apartment sit.  We'll see, I'm getting ahead of myself.  But, man, would I love to do this trip.  So if you have suggestions on (a) where I can make some big cash fast (remembering that I'm 38, although it still  tastes  like chicken), or (b) where I can visit a bear that plays the piano or the World's Largest Zipper or similar American Kitsch, lemme know.  PS:  Can  urlLink someone  tell me what one wears to Southern Decadence?

       Taking the Fifth  Is there anything more anticlimactic than the day  after  a holiday?  The anticipation is over, the festivities (whatever they were) are over, and yet the Hallmark store on Broadway hasn't had a chance to change their windows yet, so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be looking forward to.  I wanna runaway, but I have nowhere to run to.  And no possible means of escape.  And remind me again what it is I'm running from?  People discuss their holiday.  They ask me what I did.  I deflect, but they think it's funny.  I solve other people's problems.  In the elevator, at work, over the phone.  Small, everyday problems but they were baffled until I clarified, offered solutions.  It's easy because those things have nothing to do with me, I have nothing but perspective.  Other people think my life can't be as fucked up as I present it, because I'm so helpful with theirs.  They think I'm funny.  I don't tell them how it really is, because that's depressing.  Might incriminate me.   Gotta stay funny.  Gotta stay here.  Hurry up, Hallmark...what's next?

        urlLink July 3, 1981   I don't remember the date,  per se .  I was a year out of high school, still living in Tampa, 19 years old and as out as I could be.  Were Biff and I dating then?  I think so.  We met at Busch Gardens (I was Entertainment, thus the elite, but he ran The Scorpion, hence he was hot).  We'd go with the whole gang to El Goya, dance on that postage-stamp dance floor.  At the height of the evening, usually an ABBA song, glitter would fall on us and stick to our sweaty skin and clothes.  I danced with my shirt on then, too embarrassed of my skinny body.  Besides, that was considered pretty racy.  The guys that did poppers on the dance floor took their shirts off.  The guys that brought the tambourines.  We dressed to go out and we danced together.  I was living in that one bedroom apartment in Hyde Park, the one that only had air conditioning in the living room.  We'd go to my house after dancing, drive there in Biff's two-tone orange Camaro, pull the mattress off the bed and drag it in front of the a/c.  Then we'd roll around for hours like puppies.  Because that's what we  were .  Sex was just fun, our bodies were playgrounds, not yet battlefields.  There were other bars in Tampa, too.  Rene's: strictly a low-rent drag bar, presided over by Tiffany Middlesex.  But attached to the main bar and surrounded by a high concrete wall was a pool that gave the place what little cache it had.  We joked that the pool was so filthy from all the action it got you could walk across it.  Then there was the Old Plantation, the "OP."  This was scarier.  Edgier.  This was where the big boys went to dance.  It was no frills, unfinished wood, Western.  Jordache, no shirts, sweaty, sexy.  It took me a long time to be able to walk in there, and a long time before I could walk in alone.  El Goya was somehow safe, the OP was hardcore.  Notorious.  If anyone saw you walk into the OP, there was no doubt you were gay, and no doubt what you were after.  Maybe it was that summer that the rumors started: "Don't dance too close to those sweaty guys at the OP.  You can catch something."  "What?"  "Just don't."  It didn't make sense to me then.  It doesn't now, either.  Of course it wasn't that simple and we got only slightly more information.  There wasn't any gay press in Tampa.  There was a gay bar rag that served all of south Florida, mostly ads for bars and baths, pictures of drag queens winning titles, and personal ads where men described themselves as Greek Active or Passive.  And the meager news we did get made even less sense.  Bodily fluids?  C'mon.  Sweat?  Spit?  Just cum?  And no one used rubbers.  Rubbers were bought by straight boys, what did we need them for?    Maybe it seems unbelievable today, but we just didn't believe it.  It seemed far away and unreal.  No one we knew was getting sick.  Granted, I was afraid of a lot of things in the gay scene (not that I would've admitted it...I masked it with strong, misguided judgements), so I never went to Club Tampa, the notorious bathhouse that my friend Pietro managed.  Group sex didn't titillate me.  Leather was for old guys.  I fumbled around in cars, or with my boyfriend, or if I was single with guys I'd meet at bars.  And to tell the truth, I swallowed sometimes but there wasn't a lot of Greek on the menu, passive or active.  So maybe my youthful innocence served me in a way I couldn't have guessed.  When I moved to New York, everything was different.  In 1983, the boys of Manhattan were spooked but good.  I remember that first year taking back to my miserable little residence hotel room on 77th and Broadway the kind of boy I thought I should marry.  He was like an idealized version of me: lean, glasses, smart...and scared to death.  Wiley, his name was...funny I should remember him.  He was awfully flirty in the bar, even on the way back, but once we were alone and got undressed the boy was terrified.  Afraid to touch, afraid of having a "port of entry" somewhere he hadn't checked, could only kiss with a closed mouth.  He finally gave up trying and got dressed, near tears, apologizing profusely.  Maybe I remember him because he was the only one who admitted to his fear so openly, the others just played along quietly.  I saw scarecrows everywhere then.  Walking, talking images I'd only seen before in documentaries about Auschwitz.  People would fall silent and whisper, "My God, he used to be so beautiful."  I couldn't imagine it.  Sometimes I wouldn't see someone for awhile and when they turned up, healthy and fat, I'd breath such a sigh of relief.  Sometimes I'd get calls from Florida.  I showed up to my favorite acting class one day and it was cancelled.  That was my first trip to Campbell's Funeral Home and I'll never go back.  The memorial services were cathartic.  But so many times it seemed that we were trying to distance ourselves from It as much as we were trying to mourn.  They were funny, though, we'd laugh a lot.  These were genuine productions with musical numbers and props and so many good stories.  And you'd leave with two thoughts: "That could've/should've been me" and "Who's next?"  Survivor's guilt.  It's embarrassing to talk about.  I sure as hell had it.  Have it.  I'd been around longer than some of those guys, I'd slept with more men, I'd been unsafe even after I knew better.  Why  not  me?  I don’t have an answer.  It scares me still.  Sword of Damocles.  I’d see a play like "As Is" or a movie like "Parting Glances" and my stomach would knot up, I’d feel sick and a little dizzy.  For days after I’d be checking my glands to see if they were enlarged.  Was that a bruise or KS?  If I got a little hot at night, I’d worry it was nightsweats.  If this seems ridiculous to you now, all I can tell you is you’re lucky.  Because it was a daily terror for me and I wasn’t alone.  If you didn’t have It now, then you were potentially "next."  Twenty years.  I can’t wrap my mind around the fact that sex is still deadly.   Sex!   I can’t believe that funny, fun, good men who shaped the man I am aren’t around with me now.  And I especially can’t believe they’re not around because they Fucked Around.  Which now equals Fucked Up.  Which is insane.  I knew those men, I  am  those men.  What is it they wanted or did that had to end in their deaths?  Affection.  Companionship.  Love.  Warmth.  Sex.  I want those things…is that my death sentence, too?  My blood and my semen could turn against me anytime.  The next time I look for some kind of intimacy with a man, for whatever reason in whatever manner, could cause me to test positive.  But I’ve tried to shut down and that didn’t work.  Shutting people out didn’t either.  So I stumble along, still waiting for the word but still looking for love.  Remembering my brothers fallen, supporting my brothers fighting.  And all I really know twenty years later is there’s  still  no sense, and  still  no blame.    And still no relief.

       Summer In The City  It's impossible, even for me, to be filled with self-loathing when it's 65 degrees in Manhattan.  The breeze off the Hudson is cooling but not chilly, and it stirs the air that usually just hangs sullenly outside my building, waiting like a thug to grab me the minute I step outside, putting his dirty, hot hand over my mouth until I can wriggle free and step into the next haven of air cooling.  Nope, today I'll have to earn a sweat, it won't be handed to me.  My doorman's enjoying the breeze by standing smack in the center of the doorway, but he steps aside by the third time I ask and mumbles a drunken apology.  The stacks of garbage along 54th Street don't knock me over with their stench today, and even the urine-soaked steps of the R train aren't offensive.  Of the two remaining homeless people in my neighborhood, only one is still encased in layers of wool...but he has his shoes off, his feet soaking in the fountain in Fisher Park smoking a nub of a cigar.  Maybe the other one's taking a holiday on East 54th.  The sky is bright and clear and it makes the tops of buildings easier to see, so while tourists are gaping up I can easily maneuver around them, no need for me to scowl or mutter.  Boys on blades, boys on bikes, boys on skateboards.  Most of them in shorts and wrap around Oakley knock-offs that make them look like sexy bugs.  The Pakistani vendor on the corner smiles his craggy smile and I'm sure that a day like today is a blessing for him, too, because it keeps that $2 toupee from being itchy and sweaty.  And, man, do those synthetic fibers gleam in the sun!   The bruised fruit on his cart is less like Balducci's and more like 3:55am at The Lure, but I'm experienced at both and so I manage to walk away with some decent-looking bananas and a pound of juicy grapes and I have to smile because my thermogenics will burn through them before I've finished chewing.  Maybe later I'll make some Thai martinis, take the service stairs to the top, jimmy open the side window, break out onto the roof and enjoy the breeze and whatever I can glimpse through the windows of the surrounding hotels and apartment buildings.  Maybe you didn't recognize it, but the above is a valentine.  Sure, you've got fireflies and backyards.  I can see the Chrysler Building.

      At 96th Street I turn onto Columbus and head downtown.  It's not raining nearly as hard as it was and I need to walk.  Even for Sunday evening it seems quiet, as though the rain has muted the city.  People on the street aren't talking, or they’re talking quietly; the taxis roll by softly, wetly.  I look through windows at people in diners, laundromats.  They seem content, relaxed.  I'm probably projecting.  It’s just that I don't feel content.  The rain makes me sad, and I feel a diffused dissatisfaction.  But walking feels right.  So I walk past shops closing, quietly locking up and rolling down their gates and restaurants that used to be different restaurants.  Almost every other storefront has a memory for me, mostly from the time that this was  the  avenue to stroll on a weekend evening.  The rain is the perfect veil through which to see those other restaurants, those other shops, where I spent time with faces now lost, or forgotten.  Or discarded.  I have a call to return to one of those faces.  It's been a week and I can’t pick up the phone.  We sometimes walked down Columbus Avenue, she and I, talking about shows and boys, of Big Plans for the Future.  It's the future now, and I can't face her.  Her Big Plans turned out different than we’d discussed, but better.  Mine haven't turned out at all.  Those long ago nights we strolled for the company but also because we couldn't afford anything else.  All these years later I still can't afford anything else, but now there's shame, too.  Nothing to show for the passage of time.  She has a husband, a house, children.  I have what I've always had; what I had then, and nothing more.  Ephemeral as the rain.  Past 83rd Street and the building where I spent my first night in this city, exhausted and dreaming the big dreams.  At 80th Street the bar where I couldn’t afford to drink, where the men were too glamorous and scary to talk to.  I’d sit, instead, across the street on a bench behind the Museum of Natural History, watching those men entering and leaving the bar, waiting for the nerve to join them.  Now I walk past those benches, wet and deserted, the light beginning to fail and the dark green of the trees that line the museum seem almost to drip their dark color onto me.  And I wish I could pass the boy I was sitting on that bench tonight so I could just say hi, tell him it’s all gonna be okay.  Lie to him.  The skies open up a little more and the wind blows the rain onto my clothes, but it’s a warm rain and I guess I don’t mind.  What do I say to those people who expected great things from me?  How do I say things are fine when things aren’t?  My house is a mess, my head is a mess.  The  shoulds  rain harder under this umbrella then the drops falling on the outside; I'm soaked in them.  And I do mind.  A couple sitting under an umbrella at an outdoor café look down into their drinks not at each other, but their heads connect and protected from the downpour, there’s tenderness.  My life lacks tenderness.  At the end of this walk is a cold apartment building full of neighbors I barely know and a series of rooms in disarray.  It doesn’t seem like a life, but I suppose it must be.  It’s not the satisfaction of knowing your place in life, of relaxing on your own porch and listening to rain through the leaves.  No, this is a life where the struggle is constant and the churning goes to bed with you and the rain thumps emptily on an air conditioner in a thirteenth-floor window.  Crossing 72nd Street and it’s astounding how it’s changed but hasn’t.  I’ve worked on this street, eaten and fought and kissed on this street.  There’s no proof of it, of course, the rain’s carried all traces of it eastward toward the park and westward to the river.  Those events exist in my mind and probably nowhere else.  It’s even quieter now and I realize the rain has stopped.  I fold up my umbrella and feel the occasional drops from the buildings and streetlights.  I feel as good as I’m able.  70th Street, 69th Street and I have to force myself not to think of two more people I’ve disappointed.  Funny that they should live just a block apart, as if I were methodically working my way uptown and yet there’s no pattern to my destruction, just random victims of my high pressure system.  I wish it would start raining again.  Feeling the water on my skin, on my clothes, made me feel like I was a part of something larger, instead of a part of, well, nothing at all.  But it’s stopped and the hushed voices are raising again, and the traffic is louder again.  I think, This is my city and the rain’s washed it clean.   This is my life and the rain’s changed nothing.

       Turns Out Bette Midler Was Right...  And I got a couple of friends, but man oh man, one in particular.  Well, first I don't, in any way,  wanna discount the restorative powers of hearing  urlLink FuzzMuffin's  dirty little voice on my machine.  Or getting a let's-snap-you-out-of-it drink invite from the  urlLink MinxBot .  The goofy, showtuney email from  urlLink D'Levy  and a potentially helpful email from  urlLink BJ  both made me feel like a lot less like a big loser and that the whole world was pissed at me.  And really, what beats virtual milk and cookies, huh  urlLink Matteo ?  Y'know how you wanna send someone a note sometimes, say when something bad has happened or maybe someone's died or something, but you don't do it because you think maybe the sentiment seems trite or it's not really gonna make a difference anyway?  It makes a difference.  And what seems like trite to you, seems like a nice confirmation of things the person on the receiving end really wants/needs to hear.  I find myself at another stupid life juncture, but I feel a lot less stupid 'cause a couple of people were nice.  Thanks guys.  And then there's JSquared.  I've mentioned him before here.  Jon Jordan:  Hair Catalyst to the Stars, Diva Wrangler, Raconteur and my personal Auntie Mame.  He's the Mayor of Broadway, everybody knows him.  He's from a huge, lower, lower middle class Italian family, grew up in Bridgeport, his mother dealt drugs out of their kitchen...by all rights he ought to be dead or in jail or just extremely bitter.  Instead he's a total delight.  That family background just serves his legend.  With all those brothers and sisters in the house and a drug-ring to run, the cooking and cleaning fell to Baby Jon.   But because of that, he's the only person I know who can come to your house, open your refrigerator, find two olives, some flat 7-up, and soy sauce and make a sumptuous dinner for eight.  And that's barely an exaggeration.  He wandered into my life a few years ago, when he and his then roommate moved into my building and, after dating and dumping his roommate, I kept Jon Jordan.  We kept each other, I guess.  [NB:  He's almost never referred to as just Jon, it's always JonJordan -- one word -- and he likes it that way]  I've never known anyone like him.  He's part Debbie Reynolds and part Jack the Ripper.  He's a little Willie Wonka, a little Lucrezia Borgia, and a whole lotta .  There's enough Italian Grandmother mixed in there that making sauce is second nature and he can do it (and has) while he's talking on the phone  and  coloring someone's hair  and  designing a wig for Eartha.  And when someone's been just evil to us, that superstitious grandmother part makes us write down that person's name and put it in our shoes and walk around on it all day...I don't know if that voodoo works, but it always feels better to me.  He's got a saucy little swagger and really mischievous eyes.  He's very Thirties.  He's also very Grand-Luxe Fifties.  Because of a sort of passing acquaintance to Nathan Lane (and because he's usually all the place you expect Nathan to be) he's been mistaken for him once or twice.  Jon Jordan took it a step further by once asking Nathan if people mistook him for Jon Jordan.  Nathan was nonplussed.  Stars love him, though.  Chorus girls love him, too  Even the straight Local 1 guys love him.  He loves old MGM movies (especially the obscure ones), Judy, Liza, Marilyn, vintage bowling shirts, Chad Hardwick, laundry done by someone  any one else, KetelOne martinis-shaken-three-olives-dirty-no-not-dirty- filthy , The Theatre, white flowers, and, perhaps most importantly, an audience.  Oh sure, he's exasperating and quirky as hell, he's never on time, but the fabulousness far outweighs the rest.  He's also incredibly loyal.  Once you've found a way into Jon Jordan's heart, you're there to stay.  And he takes that very seriously.  Jon Jordan will do anything for the people he truly loves.  He's more than generous to his dozens and dozens of acquaintences and casual friends, but once you're Jon Jordan's  family , he'll stop at nothing to protect and defend and bring any pleasure he can.  A little over a year ago, when finances et cetera really started to unravel for me, I noticed that, of all my friends, Jon Jordan was the one to reach for the tab before I could, or just show up at my door with a big Tupperware of pasta fazoul he'd made too much off.  He didn't make a big deal out of it, he just did it.  Then when my mood began to turn ugly and desperate, he called me even more than our usual three or four nonsense calls a day, made up things to do, dyed my hair platinum to distract me, cursed my enemies louder than I did (oh yes, we had plenty o' names stuffed in our shoes).  Y'know how people say "I'll be there for you?"  He never said it.  He just was.  He  was .  In all the ways that mattered and then some.  Well, last night when I got home from the Evil Empire after all the job trauma, and still feeling like crap about disappointing David (and myself) by not making the trip, and wondering what I was gonna tell the IRS about their $10,000, and trying to figure out the ramifications of the lien that New York State has put against me for $4,000 (if I'm this poor, how come I owe so much in taxes?), and looking through the back of the closet for my Pseudo-Corporate Temp Wear in case I had to go answer phones at a law firm come Tuesday morning, etc., etc., Jon Jordan called to check on me.  I really had been fine, laughing about it even, but the minute I started talking to him I just broke.  Really.  Like an 8-year-old girl.  And Jon Jordan didn't tell me I'd be okay, or I'd pull through this like all the other times, or I'd feel better tomorrow.  Nope.  He said, "Honey,  we'll  get through this.  You're not alone, I'm with you.  We'll solve these problems together and I won't let you be homeless and toothless and poor.  I'll be right by your side and we'll face it all together and I promise we'll make everything right again.  I'm here."  The fear I  knew  I was carrying around, what I hadn't realized was how  alone  I felt.  Not lonely.  Alone.  An indescribably hollow feeling.  It's the Alone-ness that made me want to fall asleep at night and just never wake up again...sever my tether to this world and float on into whatever's next.  The Alone-ness was stark, cold-making, and something I could neither name nor put and end to on my own.  It was me running down endless, icy, stainless steel corridors to nowhere.  Nightmarish.  Until it was gone in that instant.  Evaporated.  Really, just that quickly.  I have Jon Jordan in my life, on my side, in my corner.  Cheerleading for the good things, cursing my foes to filth in Bridgeportese.  It's somehow a palpable energy.  Warm and cluttered and complicated and enveloping.  I know where it lives and I can go put my hands on it when they're shaky.  I feel far stronger and, in fact, I am.  It seems an odd lesson to learn on the brink of my 39th birthday, and oddly simplistic.  It's the kind of thing I'd probably mock in a movie (or someone else's blog).  More important than money, or jobs, or  things , is the solid knowledge that I'm not alone in the Universe.  There's someone in the world who will not let me fall down.  I've got Jon Jordan.  Wow.

      So, here's a little bit of what happened.  At the end of last week, I got hit with a couple of unexpected bills.  Little things like, "pay this $200 or we'll turn off your electricity."  That's easy, you say, call ConEd and get a payment plan.  That  was  the payment plan.  The IRS was demanding some portion of the $10,000 that I owe them or they'd come and clean out my bank accounts, the guy that prepares my taxes wanted a little piece, I needed new contacts and both my insurance and my prescription had expired, etc., etc.  By Monday morning I was left with $300 in the bank and still a month behind in rent.  This probably wouldn't have been as big an issue if I'd been able to make some cash from my apartment sale or eBay auctions, but, well, I didn't.  In addition, the crowd of people who were so anxious to help me out with Dexter had disappeared.  Most into the fog that was Junior's Birthday.  There were people who offered to stop by and walk him every once in a while, but a dog is not a cat.  They're social animals, this one especially.  They need attention and food and walks.  Not just someone sporadically stopping by to check on them.  And I wasn't gonna let Dex be an afterthought.  I looked into kennels, but they were all at least $25 a day and that added up to way too much, especially for someone with $300 in the bank.  So I was already anxious when I got into work on Monday evening to find out that there was something afoot there as well.  After a year and a half, I was being asked to sign non-disclosure agreements and background check documents.  I've been through this before.  The background check especially.  One of the things they check is credit and, as we all know, my credit's the worst.  I was released from a temp job where they loved me because my credit sucked.  Was I handling money?  Nope.  Anything to do with funds?  Nope.  Just good ol' word processing, where tip-top credit is so important to job performance.  I figured my days were numbered here and I couldn't leave town not knowing whether or not I had a job to jump back into to make up for the two weeks of not working.  I couldn't afford to let that stretch into another week or two without work.  Now I'd been letting David know all along that things weren't falling into place.  He didn't seem worried.  Let me amend that: he didn't seem interested.  He blithely told me that everything would work out, without asking me anything concrete about the issues at hand or offering any suggestions.  For instance, regarding Dex, he offered: "I'm sure we can get someone to stop in and check on him."  Sorry, not good enough.  I tried to tell him about the money issues and he offered, "well, if you need an extra hundred, let me know."  Ummm, no, I need an extra $1,000.  Anyway, I finally called him Monday night and said that I didn't see how I could leave with so much up in the air.  I got him on his cellphone, he was in a bar with a friend, and all he could say was "So you're saying you're not going?"  I explained that I wanted to go very much, but how could I?  He said, "I can't talk to you about this now" and hung up.  It's the last time we've talked.  Did he want to know more about why I couldn't go?  Did he offer to leave whatever bar he was in and come talk this over with me?  No, he just hung up.  And now I'm the most hated boy in Puppetland.  I came into the Evil Empire today and everyone I work with has been fired.  I have a job until Saturday.  So I called my temp agency and the first thing they said was, "Awwwww, and the market is so terrible right now...that's too bad..."  Heartening.  Well, at least I have a long weekend to decide what to do.  Send your sleeping pills, tranquilizers, barbituates, etc., in an umarked envelope, care of Everlasting Blogstalker, New York City, New York 10011.

       Details, Details...  I think other people handle these sorts of trips very well.  I used to be one of those people.  I've seen the world, beheld it's wonders.  And now look at me:  I haven't been off the Island of Manhattan (except for my brief visit to Brooklyn with  urlLink Choire ) for over a year.  Maybe I'm out of practice.  There just seem to be too many details; it's the worst possible time to leave.  So I talk it over with the dog and I make lists.  But now I'm wandering around with things on my list like "buy blue hair for chaps" and "remind David about the picture-thingy so we don't have to look for it" and "Allen's mouse box and pot."  It still makes sense to me, but I fear soon it won't.  I'm being awfully brave, though.  Y'see, I'm taking one of those leaps.  I'm acting somewhat on faith that this is the right thing to do (not easy for a Virgo).  After all, what deeply-in-debt homo decides to take a two-week vacation when he doesn't even get vacation pay?  It's a little crazy and, quite possibly, self-destructive.  However, I feel compelled to make this journey.  Not just for the vacation aspect, although naturally I'm very much looking forward to being in new places and people.  I feel almost as though I'm supposed to take this trip; that at the end, or maybe somewhere in the middle, there'll be an epiphany, or some sort of life altering moment, and at the other end things will be clearer, better.  Hell, that sounds even crazier, doesn't it?  But I do feel there's a larger reason for me to be travelling, I've felt something vague but gut-level ever since it was offered to me, and I'm gonna go with it.  Really, could I be any worse off?  So, if you're interested, here's what you can do:  Be supportive.  Don't let me dwell too much on the negative.  Tell me my ass looks hot in those chaps.  Maybe show up on Sunday and buy something (yeah, I'm trying the apartment sale one more time).  Perhaps post yourself along our travel route with pie and Gatorade.  It's small to you, but it's scary to me.  And while I usually avoid this sort of thing, Goddess help me I'm actively looking for nice.  For comfort.  Be Kind To Charlie.  Oh yeah, Valium wouldn't hurt, either.

       The Dream About The Squid  Man, has it stuck with me.  It should be funny.  Actually, in the retelling, lots of it  sounds  funny in the retelling, but I can't tell you how terrified I was when I awoke.  And some of that terror lingers still.  I guess the fact that I was anxious about this apartment sale that never really took off plays largely into it.  Also, giving into depression, I ordered in lasagna and, yes, fried calamari.  And then I had a dream about a squid.  Does anyone remember when exactly I became a parody of myself?  Nevertheless, after that heavy meal I fell into a deep, narcotic sleep on the sofa and had this long, very detailed dream, which I'm going to recount in fragments.  I apologize in advance for the incoherence which follows.  I do not, however, apologize for the insanely pop-psych symbolism included in my nightmare.  The first part involves becoming aware that a robbery has occurred.  Quite a lot of money has been stolen and the culprit is a somewhat infamous thief.  Not long after I'm walking down a street by the Hillsborough River in Tampa (blocks from where I grew up) and I see the theif suspended above the ground between two trees in a sort of net.  Below him is a large jar that contains the money.  I see that, to safeguard it, he's also placed in the jar a huge and vicious squid (do squid even have foul tempers?).  I realize that I can get the money out of the jar, simply by pulling it out with a stick, which I do.  I remember counting the money and finding it odd that it was mostly small bills and not in any order (a twenty, then some ones, then a fifty, then another twenty, etc.).  The squid is now also out of the jar and has grown somewhat larger and is menacing the thief (who's out of the net and on the ground somehow).  There's a car between the two of them and the theif yells at me to help him.  I yell back that he can certainly outrun a squid, but he says I don't understand.  I'm walking toward a bridge at the end of the block (the Buffalo Boulevard Bridge), one that I used to cross all the time as a boy.  As I look back over my shoulder, I see that the squid is transforming into a huge, menacing man, large and dark with a stern look on his face, and he's beginning to follow me.  I'm startled, but I'm not yet too worried as his lower half is still mostly squid and I can make better time.  The next part I remember is being in a store of some kind, maybe a grocery store.  I try to tell the security guards about the squid, but I don't remember it doing much good.  Not that they didn't believe me, just that they were ineffectual.  No one knew what to do or seemed to have any urgency about it.  At some point the man-creature catches up with me and I realize that by pouring water on him he'll go back to being a squid.  I wrap him up in several plastic garbage bags and head back over the bridge to the police station.  Now the police station I've been referred to is, in reality, the one that's just down my block here in New York.  The location of it in my dream is, again, on the riverbank, close to where I discovered the money in the first place.  On my way back toward the bridge, I'm intercepted by a Japanese woman who doesn't speak much English.  I'm not sure how or why, but I get talked into going up to her fourth-floor walkup apartment to help her with something.  I've explained to her that I have to get the squid to the police station before he turns back into a man so he doesn't hurt anyone, but having him wrapped up so small, even I don't seem too worried about it.  But being in the heat seems to have an effect on the squid and, even though I wrap it up in another garbage back, it's beginning to get bigger again, much like dough rising.  As I finally get out of this Japanese woman's apartment (and I swear, while I was annoyed with her, I don't know why I was there), I notice that the bag has broken and the squid is out.  There's fluid dripping from the bag and I hear a scuffle, maybe even a scream, from the apartment I just left and I break out into a run.  Now I'm running down the street toward the bridge, but I can't move my legs very fast at all.  And I can't seem to walk up the bridge either.  It's very high and, while it's a smooth ramp up, I can't seem to get anywhere.  I know that the man-squid is going to come after me soon, and it makes me panic, but my legs just won't move.  I think this is the part where I woke up.  I know there was another long part that took place in a ballroom, with a stage and secret rooms off the balconies, but I can't remember why I was there or with whom.  Actually, re-reading this, it seems kinda stupid.  But I was sweating and couldn't move my arms or legs when I woke up and my heart was racing.  There was so much detail in this dream, especially the parts taking place by the river and the bridge, things I hadn't remembered for years, that I was disoriented as to where I was, even wondering if I was back in Tampa for a minute or two.  I know it's all anxiety about money and traveling and moving, etc.  Also, a good warning that I shouldn't eat fried calamari.  But I don't ever need to see the squid-man again.  Ever.  All in all, I would rather have  urlLink dreamt about Julianne Moore ...

       Restless  Turning off the lamp, forcing myself to finally turn off the television, getting the dog to settle.  Settling down myself.  And nothing.  Breathing.  Breathing slower.  But my mind keeps going.  Do I have enough money for this trip?  How can I sell my junk?  If I move, what do I do with my furniture?  Do I keep the apartment, sublet it, or just let it go?  I even tried to induce the nightmare about the squid, just to distract, but it wouldn't come.  Finally, somewhere along the way, I drift off, but it's not anymore restful.  My dreams are the same lists, worries, questions.  And I've sworn off all the distractions...

       Sunday, Bloody Awful Sunday  I cleared a whole afternoon.  I posted signs all over the neighborhood.  I dusted and cleaned all the items for sale and moved them into the living and dining rooms.  And I waited.  I chatted online with  urlLink Chay  and  urlLink Todd  and I waited.  I ordered Italian food and I waited.  Oh sure, the Pakistani woman with the shrieking child who kept throwing things at my dog showed up fairly early.  She offered me $5 for my $700 dinner table.  She offered me $5 for all of my Fiestaware.  She offered me $5 for my weight bench.  I finally let her have some bowls for $5 and asked her to leave and to take her shrill, dog-hating spawn with her.  She was the least weird and annoying person who passed through my door all day.  Of course, there were only 6 or 7 people who passed through my door the whole day.  I finally locked the door and threw myself on the sofa for a little nap before my bowling date.  I can't even completely explain the nightmare I had, but it was so horrifying, and involved so much personal imagery, that I'm surprised I was able to revive from it at all.  I awoke two hours later so groggy and disoriented that I would gladly have drifted back into my horrible dream just to avoid consciousness, but I had to drag my ass down to Bowlmore Lanes to meet friends.  Bowling.  I don't get it.  I don't think it's easy, I just don't get it.  And it's not even cheap.  $4 for the shoe rental  (which left me with only $1 from my sale), plus $6.95 per person per game.  To roll a ball.  I guess I was just out of sorts from my failed apartment sale and my very weird nightmare.  I didn't even enjoy the deep fried foods that were offered.  I wanted pie.  They had no pie.  Fine.  Yesterday was also the last day for several items I had up for auction on eBay.  They didn't sell either.  I did get weird email about them.  One kind of nasty exchange with the hack author of a second-rate musical theatre memoir, and another exchange from some weirdo who wanted me to donate my items to his not-for-profit organization.  I explained that I was very much for-profit and couldn't help him out.  He keeps sending me email.  I keep thinking about my dinner and movie date with an old friend on Saturday night.  He wouldn't let me pay for a thing, he kept telling me to put the cash towards my road trip fund, and did his best to make me feel like this was all just a too-long rough patch rather than let me feel like a big loser.  And as much as I appreciated his efforts, I felt even more like a big loser.  C'mon, when someone offers to pay for your anti-depressants, what other conclusion is there?

       The Big Apple of My I  What was it that reminded me?  Was it walking past my old apartment building on Ninth Avenue?  Or hearing that Joe Jackson song?  Whatever it was, it occurred to me this morning that it's my anniversary month.  In August 1983 (I used to remember the exact day), I finally moved home.  That's right, 20-year-old Charlie packed up three suitcases (two soft-sided ones stuffed with clothes, one old blue hardsided Samsonite full of books and scripts and music), stuffed his pockets with all the money he had in the world ($250), hopped on a People's Express flight, and moved to New York City.  It wasn't a difficult decision and I can't remember my mother even pretending to be surprised by it.  I wasn't scared or apprehensive in the least, regardless of the fact that I had never even  visited  New York.  My friend Karen, who'd been living here for about a year and the only person I knew in the City, found me a month-long sublet in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn (a lovely Mafia-controlled neighborhood) and promised to meet me at the Newark Airport and that's all the preplanning I did.  Ah, youth.  I was as tall then as I am now (5'11"), but I probably weighed about 140lbs (that would be some 50lbs less than I do now).  I had large, clear hornrim glasses, almost too big for my skinny face, and very soon an Astor Place Barber buzzcut.  I remember a few years later seeing a photograph of myself that first year and I looked like I'd just been released from a P.O.W. camp.  I got the first job I applied for, selling vintage clothing at the Antique Boutique, which mostly involved hauling scratchy, woolen overcoats in an unairconditioned store in 90 degree heat.  But I was in New York!  That job must've paid something like $6 an hour.  All I could afford for lunch every day was a chicken parmigiana sandwich and an iced tea from the DeLeon Deli and I'd take it over to Washington Square and eat and people watch.  The West Village was still very gay and the East Village was still very punk and here the twain met...plus NYU students, tourists, drug dealers.  I think I fell somewhere in the middle of all those types in my sleeveless Antique Boutique t-shirt (ill-advised, considering my li'l spaghetti arms), gay glasses, punk haircut, funky Canal Jeans chemical warfare pants and, probably, red Converse high tops.  I felt very much a New Yorker lunching there.  After just a couple of weeks, the machinations of the evil sisters who shared the other half of my sublet helped solidify my decision to move into Manhattan and so I dragged my three suitcases through the streets of Manhattan to find temporary housing.  I ended up in a couple of different residence hotels.  Bed, sink, bathroom down the hall.  The kind of places where you pulled up the shade in the morning and the light in the room changed not at all.  Beyond broke, I borrowed a hotplate and a pot from Karen and I'd buy generic macaroni (remember generic food?), boil it on the hotplate, drain it, then stir in the generic sauce a little at a time so the macaroni would heat it.  Mostly I drank room temperature, generic instant tea (meant to be iced, but no fridge = no ice).  But so what?  I was a starving actor in New York!  It was romantic.  I quit Antique Boutique because they were awful people and, hell, this was my new life -- I didn't have to put up with that anymore.  There followed a series of colorful jobs, left for more or less the same reason: cocktail waiter at Uncle Charlie's, bottle sorter at Uncle Charlie's,  urlLink old fashioned switchboard  answering service operator, touring with a two-man marionette production of "The Wizard of Oz,"  urlLink Bloomingdale's  deli clerk,  urlLink Macy's cologne squirter  ("Try Aramis today?"), candy butcher in a shop on Christopher Street called Sweet Stuff, waiter in a "gay" restaurant (we had "gay" restaurants in the '80s), et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  They all paid lousy, but I managed.  Many nights I'd walk all the way home from Broadway and Eighth Street all the way up to Broadway and 77th to save that extra 75 cents.  Didn't matter.  The jobs, the scrimping...it was all fodder for stories I'd tell on Carson.  Most importantly in those early weeks, I had my first New York audition.  When I think back on it I realize that, for such a smart boy, I really was kinda green.  But that was the reason I was here and I wasn't gonna wait too long before jumping in.  I had a Tony to win by the time I was 30, damnit!  I scoured Backstage for just the right show to introduce me to New York, and wrote the details down in my Professional Actor's Datebook.  It was all the way uptown, 103rd and Fifth, at the Rosetta LeNoire Theatre for  urlLink Amas Rep's  production of  urlLink Mama, I Want To Sing .  I'm sure I was nervous as hell, but the details are blurry except for what I sang.  Yes, Ladies and Germs, I gave 'em " urlLink Corner of the Sky !"  And you know what?  They were  nice .  Really nice. No snickering, no New York attitude.  Maybe they thought I was crazy, a skinny white boy singing "Pippin" for them so he could be in their gospel musical, or maybe they could just tell how young I was and guessed it was my first New York audition, but they were  nice .  Not nice enough to cast me, but three or four auditions later and I got my first-ever season of summer stock.  I remember getting the call (from a woman named Peggy, whom I've never seen or heard from since, but I remember her name) that I'd be whisked up to New London, New Hampshire (via Trailways), rehearse and perform in a full season of shows, but also help make costumes, build sets and props, and help keep the theatre and its grounds neat and tidy.  We'd be housed and fed in a ramshackle cast house (the boys all sharing one large, bizarre dorm room with, I swear, little cubbies that looked like train compartments, complete with a curtain to pull across for privacy).  And at the end of this exciting, fun-filled summer, we'd receive a stipend of $100.  I was so excited I couldn't sleep that night and I made my roommate Kevin take a walk with me where I literally danced with joy down West 47th Street.  I was a working New York Actor!  Eighteen years later I'm a little harder to please, a little wiser about the world, but more or less still after the same things.  Oh yeah, I've changed a lot, and so has New York.  My first year in Manhattan there were  urlLink Checker cabs  everywhere, and  way  better than any limo.  The zipper in Times Square wasn't digital, it was made of thousands of little incandescent bulbs.  In fact, Times Square itself was still full of bawdy hookers and shady characters hawking watches from their coats, Salvation Army missions and seedy movie theatres that used to be grand movie palaces, and even a Weinerwald.  I found it Runyonesque.  There was an RCA Building, a PanAm Building, and an Alvin Theatre, but barely any Trump buildings.  God, I used to stop in my tracks, especially in Times Square, and remind myself "I live here!"  I'd go back to Florida for a visit and people would ask me, "How can you stand that place?" but it was Tampa I couldn't stand, where'd I'd felt uncomfortable; been the odd one.  New York embraced me the minute I arrived, wondered what'd taken me so long, pulled me across town to show me something fascinating.  I was besotted then, I'd do anything to be with her, a part of her.  Eighteen years later we're a little more like an old married couple.  I guess I take the City somewhat for granted now.  I'm impatient with the crowds and construction and street vendors.  That first year, whenever I was headed somewhere I'd been before, I'd map out a different route so I could experience new streets, get to know every inch.  Now I tend to map the shortest, least populated route.  But, honestly, I don't love her any less.  And though I'm contemplating a temporary separation, I could never divorce myself from her.  I grew up here.  I raised myself here.  I became myself here.  Manhattan was my incubator and my playground and my crucible.  Being a New Yorker is as much a part of my identity as being male, or being gay.  For New Yorkers the City is a character in our stories; a member of our family that we fight with, tolerate, get embarrassed by, but ultimately love completely and defend utterly.  So, eighteen years ago I came home for the first time.  A Native New Yorker...just born somewhere else.  And, in spite of everything, do I  still  love New York?  Fuhgeddaboutit!

       Notes from a Functioning Neurotic  Didja ever have one of those summers where you just can't wake up?  I've been trying to shake off this nap since early June.  No luck.  Every morning the clock radio wakes me up around 9ish, and I get up to turn it off, thinking I'll just get out of bed and start my day, but Morpheus always starts with "C'mon back to bed, baby, just for another few minutes, then I'll get up and make the coffee."  Which, of course, he never does.  The dog is always like, "Don't fall for that again, it'll be noon and you'll still be sleeping" but why should I listen to him?  He doesn't even have thumbs.  So I crawl back in and snuggle and somewhere around 1pm I finally become lucid and notice that not only is Morpheus way gone, but so's half the cash in my wallet and my fake Prada shoes.  Whatever...  Didja ever write something semi-fictional, just to work it out and try to stretch those muscles, and find out that other people react to it very strongly?  This is called a "hot button" issue and it has nothing to do with the author.  The author acknowledges that.  Didja ever meet someone for the first time and pick up in the middle of a conversation you started in some other life?  Remember that scene in "Xanadu" where they're in a recording studio that has all these different sets and effects built in it to inspire that bands that record there?  And then Olivian Newton-John and that guy that never made another movie start skating around in it and singing?  That was cool.  Didja ever buy a container of cottage cheese, put it in the refrigerator, then later open it and notice that it was already opened and someone had taken a couple of scoops out of it?  So you take it back to the store with the receipt and they apologize up and down and give you a new one?  And then you come home and put the new one in the fridge and realize that the container you bought before is sitting at the back of the shelf and you just indignantly returned an old container of cottage cheese that you yourself had partially eaten?  Yeah, me neither.  Didja ever have an apartment sale?  'Cause I'm having one on Sunday.  I have little signs to post all around the neighborhood and everything.  But then I'm gonna have strangers come into my apartment and haggle with me about the price of my things.  And that's a little weird.  Did it seem weird to you when you had your apartment sale?  Wanna come sit with me and help me haggle?  What I think I want is some crispy, crispy fried chicken.  And some sort of buttery biscuit.

       Revenge of the B-List  I wish you could've seen my face when I opened it.  Actually, I wish  I  could've seen my face.  And, most importantly, I wish I could've seen Blaine's face.  I recognized the return address on the envelope and, the truth is, I almost tossed it.  I mean, another glossy "invite" featuring a different-but-same glossy muscle boy wearing a different-but-same glossy g-string beckoning us to a different-but-same glossy Saturday night dance party that anyone who's going dancing is already going to anyway.  Why bother?  But the shape of it was different and my curiousity got the better of me.  In retrospect, I'm glad it did.  I wonder, was Pandora just a little bit glad, too?  I ran to the phone and called Blaine at his office, hoping he wasn't on one of his non-smoking breaks.  He wasn't.  "Blaine Hargadon," he answered in his butch phone voice.   "Hey missy," I said. "Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!" he responded, his voice soaring an octave.  Blaine can go from Manly to Mary in 0.3 seconds. "Are you sitting down?" I asked, and I blurted my news.   "How did   you   get one?" he screeched.  I knew what he meant, actually agreed in a way, but it still made me a little huffy.   "Maybe they finally ran out of A-List, dear.  Or perhaps I'm part of some sort of cultural exchange program, like the Fresh Air Fund.  I know, maybe they're bussing in queers who don't have trust funds but do have fat cells as an anthropological experiment." "Oh relax.  It's just that, I, uh, I mean...don't you think it's odd that you'd get a Gold Card out of the blue?" "What you really mean is, don't I think it's odd that I got a Gold Card and you didn't?" "Of course that's what I mean!" "Clearly there's been some hideous mistake and the minute I present it at the door I'll be wrestled to the ground by a couple of testosterclones in hazmat gear.  But until that happens, I think we're gonna get to swim in the shallow end of the pool for a change..."  Now, don't get me wrong: I'd love to be in with the in-crowd.  Who wouldn't?  We're all basically recovering from high school.  We  all  wanna be popular.  We  all  wanna sit at the cool table in the cafeteria.  We  all  wanna get chatted up by the elite between classes.  Especially fags.  We spent a lot of our time back then either trying to be invisible in the hallways so we wouldn't get beat up or counseling cheerleaders on whether or not to go all the way (I always voted for yes).  So when those of us who grow up and move away to a gay mecca finally realize it's high school all over again, we do our damndest not to fall back into that same pattern.  We reinvent.  We workout.   We buy hair product and good shoes.  We become hyper-aware of our selves and our surroundings all the time in order to create the best impression.  And, in many cases,  we relinquish most of the things that make us  interesting  in order to be  popular .  Some of the time it actually works.  I'm living proof that one can improve one's gay station in life (I've even maintained most of my personality).  But the sad fact is, if you're not inately A-List, you probably never will be.  Unless you come into a great deal of money, or win a Tony or something, that wall just can't be scaled.  Even marrying in doesn't guarantee you a permanent spot, 'cause the minute that marriage is over so's your identity (unless part of your settlement includes the house in the Pines).  But a Gold Card.   Well .  It was like opening a Wonka Bar and finding the golden ticket.  In the last reel you may not walk away with factory, but you definitely get to go inside and have a good look at it.  Maybe even touch an Oompah-Loompah.  And now I had one.  Go figure.  Two years ago I was in a passionless relationship, 50 pounds heavier, with a bad haircut and a mild form of gay agoraphobia.  Thanks to Blaine, I'd started going back to the gym for more than a sneak peek in the showers, discovered that it made me feel good about myself, shed the pounds and most of the hair, and for the first time in five years bought clothes that didn't use color and large buttons to divert attention from my body.  I'd even allowed Blaine and Alex to take me dancing at the Palladium, and I allowed myself to actually enjoy it.  The music was great, the three of us laughed and ogled boys, and I came back to life.  Or rather, came to a new life, one I couldn't have imagined before or during Peter.  A life of fun, good friends and where I actually liked myself.  Pursuing my own happiness.  Perhaps this Gold Card nonsense was just the Universe signalling to me that I was on the right path, a reward for taking care of myself, a signpost of even better things to come.  Mostly likely, though, it was a clerical error.  Didn't matter, I was ready to take this baby out for a spin.  I guess you're wondering what all the fuss is about, huh?  If you are, that probably means you have a sensible life, probably outside of one of the Big Gay Towns, and more than likely you know what "escrow" means.  New York City is a different animal.  You, The People, live your lives in homes with yards.  We, the Urban Gays, live our lives in public: bars, clubs, coffeehouses, the Runway Known As Eighth Avenue, the gym.  I know it sounds shallow, but it really...oh hell, of course it is.  A little.  But it's also fun, as long as you keep your sense of humor and don't give your life over to it.  I think they call it  balance .  But when going out becomes a career, when you're on the guestlist, when you can discuss the finer performance points of DJs and have slept with at least three, when your picture is splashed across the back pages of HomoXtra, when you spend a whole day picking out a $250 shirt that you'll deposit in coat check the minute you get in the club, when you can calculate in your head the distance of a particular trick on Eighth Avenue, figure in his body fat percentage times his potential for getting you a discount at Barney's, multiply it by who you're with, divide it by who he's with, also factoring in who's in his house on the Island and come up with the appropriate greeting (in this case, the Moving Air Kiss), then you're probably A-List.  And one of the biggest accoutrement of the A-List is the Gold Card, bestowed by our city's most prominent party promoter, Jack Flair.  The lucky bearer of the Gold Card waits not in line, nay, nor any of his posse.  He pays not to enter clubs (said posse only gets a discount).  All manner of libation are discounted.  Just a flash of the Gold can make a fellow faggot turn Green.    I know, I know...it doesn't sound like much.  And it's not.  A Gold Card can't heal the lame.  It can't turn loaves and fishes into a high-protein, low-carb meal for a hundred.  It can't turn baby aspirin into Ecstasy.  It has no power unless you  believe  it does.  But boy, do  They  believe.   They  have a goodly portion of the population convinced, too.  Jack Flair has hypnotized Gay Cafe Society into believing that to possess a Gold Card is to possess true enlightenment and inner (not to mention outer) beauty.  Of course, if you have a White Card, you can certainly wait in line, pay your cash and dance around, yes quite near, to the Gold Cards.  Maybe even catch their eye or over hear a snippet of their conversation.  Anybody can get a White Card.  They all but foist them on you.  Ordinarily  I'm  a White Card.  That was  then , this is now.  [To Be Continued]

       The View From In Here  Sitting across from, next to someone in a diner, eating someone ele's food.  Consuming someone else calories that I'll carry around as my own.  Laying on someone else's bed, listening to someone else's music, thinking someone else's thoughts that are like mine but separate and thus different.  Standing at a bar, trying to read someone else's eyes, body, mind.  Trying to define myself in someone else's gestures, postures, expressions.  So much of my life is given back to me in reconstituted fragments that don't make any more sense than they did beforehand.  But I'm grateful for the response.  Surrounded by potential and interest and nonsensically my mind drifts to a place I didn't think possible.  Is it Cleveland?  Jesus, it just might be...

      Y'know what?  I think I peaked about a month ago.  Frankly, I have nothing interesting or new to say.  It's the same old stuff that's been rotting my brain and I see no reason to publish it.  I'm tired, I'm broke, my dog's neurotic, I've got to get out of town, I need insurance, and a new bike, and a new computer, and a new Witness Protection Program profile.  So until something happens that actually interests me, I'm just gonna sit it out, instead of trying to find a way to make it readable.  In other words, I'm done for now.  Talk amongst yourselves.

       Not The Groovy, Peggy Lee Kind...  I've had a very high fever for the past several days.  Hovering around 102.  Perhaps I deserve it after my week of overindulgence.  Maybe I just caught something.  Who can say?  If I've talked to you in the past couple of days and not made sense, or disappeared mid-conversation, I apologize.  I think I talked to my doctor this morning (I did wake up with the phone in my hand), but I can't remember if it was an actual conversation or if I just dreamt it.  The dog looks worried.  JSquared says he's coming over tonight after his show to look at me, because he has abandonment issues and needs to determine just how sick I am.  He says if I'm sick enough that I'd get an 11 o'clock number in a musical he's taking me to the doctor.  I interpreted that as someone's writing a musical about me.  I do hope you'll come see it.  Even  urlLink RJ's  being nice to me.  Maybe I'm dying.  If I don't die, I'll let you know.  Maybe I'll just get better.  But right now, I'm weak.  And just when the Shriner's Convention of Blogdom hits the City this weekend.

       Charlie: 1, Terrorists: 0  Okay, not exactly.  But today I completed the task I'd set for myself last week: I voted.  I got up this morning, prayed to no one, wore what I felt like wearing, trimmed my goatee to the length I liked, and when I felt like it, I marched my homosexual self over to 58th Street and voted for the candidates of my choice (I did not write anyone in, however).  I harmed no one on my way to or from the polling place and I even bought my lunch, contributing to the economy.  All in all, I was a freakin' model citizen today, so why am I still so sad?

       Living Several Cliches  What, you thought I hadn't lived through turning 39?  Actually, an amazing thing happened: I woke up that morning 35.  And I'm sticking with it.  Besides, Gay 39 is different from Straight 39, it's essentially the equivilent of Straight 32, so saying I'm 35 is hardly lying.  Besides, I'm not getting older, I'm getting...what ever  Becky.    It's an interesting thing having a birthday in the middle of a crisis, the things that get celebrated are much simpler.  I got a couple of presents, but I didn't need them.  What I got was a highly amusing lunch with Jon Jordan and dinner with four men who I don't see as much as I'd like but who are clearly my family.  We ate Italian food at a restaurant that was losing business from the double whammy of terrorism and the Jewish holidays.  We laughed, of course we talked about  IT , but mostly we sat around that table and smiled at each other and it was simple and right.  Allen gave me a gorgeous pop-up book of The Wizard of Oz, intricate and extravagant, to remind me that there still beauty in the world, even if we have to look a little harder for it at the moment.  I also got a lot of unexpected but amazing email.  I guess when I blab about my birthday on the World Wide Internet it must seem like I'm advertising it, but I honestly didn't expect the great wishes that came to me.  Yeah, I cried.  But it was great and I thank you all.  On my way to meet my pals for dinner, I stopped in at a watering hole (heh, heh..I said  hole ) in Chelsea for a Birthday Libation.  I figured I was gonna be all weepy and sloppy all night anyway, might as well make it vodka-flavored.  The bartender that night was a friend who had worked with an old boyfriend of mine at a different Chelsea watering hole (I said  hole  again) and so, in addition to my drink he made me a birthday shot and we chatted a bit.  He asked me to come the following night to his game show "Your Date With Destiny" which, another shot later, turned into me being the lucky contestant.  I'll spare you the details as they've been  urlLink very   urlLink widely   urlLink reported  (and may I just say in my own defense I'm much cuter and thinner in person, and there were free drinks involved).  But working in the  urlLink shop  on Wednesday afternoon I got a  urlLink surprise   urlLink visit  that made me grin like a goofball.  We met again after work, headed downtown, hopped to various bars, purchased fetishwear, ate matzoh ball soup, met and attempted to bed an artist who'd consumed not only four Valium but red wine from a diner (well, the latter might've been just me...I have no luck with kickboxers.  I always get an Error 404), all of it mindless fun and stupidly funny.  Wasn't until I was walking Dex before going to bed (at 6:00am) that it occurred to me that it was the first full day in over a week that I hadn't cried once.  And I didn't feel guilty about it.  I still have a lot of sadness and, I'm sure, fear of sorts, but I managed to get distracted long enough to be happy.  Sounds easy, but just a couple of days before, allowing myself to feel light about anything seemed disgusting to me.  As they say, time heals...  And whilst I don't wanna give him too much credit, lest his handsomely-shaped noggin grow to absurd and unattractive proportions, if you're feelin' mighty low, go to your local depot and meet the train they call  urlLink The City of New Orleans ...they serve up an Eye-talian dish that'll keep a smile on your face for days and days.  The following few days were all about trying to return to normal.  I might eventually write about them in more detail, but what concerned me was that we actually  might  be returning to normal.  I mean the old, get-outta-my-way, shut-yer-stinkin'-trap, I-was-here-first, normal.  I can't do that anymore.  Me, Impatient New Yorker #1.  I can't.  I won't.  I've seen the enemy and it was me.  I've also seen that it won't kill me, or anyone else, to be a little nicer, a little easier.  But I saw the kindness, the gentleness with each other, ebbing slowly.  A little too much honking of the horns.  A few more exasperated sighs.  Sharpish comments under the breath.  The slow withdrawal of eyes meeting eyes.  Of course, I thought to myself, it had to go back to before.  We came together, showed our strength, and now we return to " excuse me the line starts over here ."  And there's not a damn thing I can do about it.  I don't expect New Yorkers to live in perpetual mourning, but I was positive some of the caring would linger.  I started to get depressed about it, and a little anxious that this moment in our City would end up just an anecdote of war, and the World Trade Center would become the Archduke Francis Ferdinand of the 21st Century, and all the candles and flyers and, hell, sandwiches would end up being as pointless as the attack itself.    I was thinking about all of this while walking home from the shop, around 8:30 on Saturday night.  Exhausted from too much partying and too little sleeping and way too much pushing of the scented candles.  I was starting to practice my backing out speech for Jonno, begging off the night's festivities.  I was passing this terrible little Italian bakery on Eighth Avenue, I mean really tasteless refrigerated gloopy custard-filled puffs and such, no charm to it at all, and one of my least favorite New York types (Middle-Aged Sequined Stars'N'Stripes Baseball Hat Wearing Former Actress With Too-Red Hair And Small, Yappy Poodle That Suffers From Canine Alopecia) was fumbling her way out of the door trying to balance her Channel 13 totebag full of crap, a cake box, and the dog.  I didn't really think about it, I just stepped over and held the door and steadied her box and she thanked me and I half-smiled and kept walking.  Moving down the sidewalk, I started to think vile thoughts about her and her dog and her stupid hat.  And then I asked myself, "So what the fuck did you grab the door for?"  And I answered myself, "'Cause she wasn't making it out by herself."  This confused me, because I'm not that nice a person.  No, really.  I don't poison ducklings or anything, I'm just fairly self-centered and focused on my own misery most of the time and probably late for something and it's so much easier to spew my bitterness than to grab a door for an old lady.  But my instinct has changed.  I've been somewhat changed.  I don't wanna become Mary Freakin' Sunshine or anything, but if I keep vigilant and don't question it too much, I could probably do my part to see that this new New York I want so to linger, does.  Does that read as Pollyanna to you as it does to me?  The scary thing is, I actually mean it.  My life, for whatever reason, is being pared down to the basics.  I'm broker than broke.  I'll have to move out of (if I'm not evicted first) my home of the last 12 years.  I'm going to have to sell of as many of my possessions as I can, and the rest I'll have to put in some remote storage space until I have a home again.  I don't have a real job.  I don't have a real career.  I'm 39 and single.  But I've got what's left of my brain and heart (ain't much,  urlLink but what's there is cherce ).  I've got several strong relationships that I can tend and mend and nurture.  And I now have the clarity, and hopefully the courage, to contribute to the creation of the better world I had a glimpse of through the smoke of a horrific act.  Honestly?  The pseudo-sophisticated, cocktail-downing, acid-tongued Alexander-Woollcott-Wanna-Be inside of me is mortified by the idea.  And I don't expect I'll be helping blind men to cross busy avenues (unless they're hot).  But, frankly, my September 10, 2001 way of thinking and behaving wasn't working out so well, and this is where I find myself now, so I might as well see where the hell it takes me.

       Tempers Fugit  Okay, I finally got angry.  You don't wanna fuck with me today.  I yelled at old people.  I was walking Dexter first thing this morning and, good dog that he is, he pulled me over to the curb to do his business.  I pulled him out of the street and onto the curb so he wouldn't get hit by the traffic moving out of the way of an ambulance.  So he started to do what he needed to do, I pulled a plastic baggie out of my pocket and waited.  An older couple, conspicuously from out of town, were passing by and the man looked at Dex and said to me, "Ever hear of curbing your dog."  That was it.  All the anger of the last few days boiled over and I let the old bastard have it.  After all, I was not only being a good citizen on my own block, but what the hell business was it of his, especially in light of everything else?  He kept asking me what I was being so sensitive about.  That made me even louder.  I mean, was this geezer kidding me?  Okay, I'll admit, my anger was somewhat disproportionate.   Somewhat .  But in a city that's pulled together in a way I've never seen and would never have expected, this was just foolishness that I wasn't going to accept.  I'm not ashamed that I yelled, I just wish I could've blasted him a little better.  It felt good to yell, too.  After that, I had to get ready to go to the shop.  I'm embarrassed to say I'm exhausted, but I am.  I haven't done a fucking thing to be tired over.  There are dogs downtown, sniffing through wreckage, that have more of a reason to be tired than I do.  But still, I admit, I'm tired.  Speaking of the working dogs, a company in the Northwest that makes sledding gear donated every single protective dog boot they had in stock to the dogs that have been hurting their paws climbing over jagged rubble.  Yeah, that news made me cry.  At work, one of the owners of the shop and I were chatting.  Sort of obliquely about our activity over the weekend.  It felt like we were dancing around something, so I said, straight out, something that  urlLink Choire  had put in my head:  maybe I was suffering a little bit from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.  John nearly broke down.  He was afraid to mention it.  So we talked about everything we were going through, the things we were feeling that we thought were foolish, the stuff that scared us.  It's just an example of the small ways we're helping each other get through this.  I know I felt better after we talked and I was pretty sure John felt better, too.  I got home to find a lot of messages on my machine.  One from a woman I hadn't been in contact with since I moved to New York 18 years ago, one from a girl I've known since kindergarten.  Several were from close friends wondering what we're doing tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  I don't even wanna think about it.  It's my 39th birthday and I haven't felt like celebrating it.  I mean, even before this mess, I wasn't feeling like it, but now even less.  It seems wrong to celebrate anything, much less me.  I'm not happy, I'm weepy and scared.  I'm embarrassed about how much I've been crying.  I don't want presents.  My friends weren't letting me out of it.  After a couple of calls, they sent our friend the psychiatrist after me.  No fair.  But we talked (he's really good at this) and I guess they're right: they love me, they want to celebrate that I'm alive, that we're all alive, and if I'm so weepy, then they want to be there.  So we're doing it.  Allen and I talked later and we're gonna try to find a restaurant downtown that's been forced to close and has lost business...that's important to me.    I don't know what else I'll do tomorrow, I can't afford my annual birthday massage at Carapan, but I think what I wanna do is buy my friends presents.  Something small that says I love them for loving me.  Something for us to remember how, in this strange time, we cared for each other.    When I was a kid, I looked forward all year to September.  It got cooler in Florida.  I'd go back to school (yeah, go ahead, say it: I was a nerd).  And it would be MY day...the one day in the whole year that was mine.  It used to be such a long time from September to September...now the time races.  Still I love the Autumn and September is still special to me.  I've learned that Greta Garbo also shared my special day (and I some of her quirks).  As a kid I could never have imagined what my life, or what the world, would really be like on September 18, 2001.  I can barely comprehend it now.  But what I do understand now is that I've got people, new and old, that I care about,  love , and those relationships, ultimately, are how I make sense of my life.  And I cherish you all.  It's midnight now.  Happy Birthday to me.

       Random Acts of Kindness  I'm so frustrated.  I've spent more time trying to volunteer, but they don't need any more volunteers.  The minute I heard that the Family Center had been moved from the Armory to 54th Street and the West Side Highway (I live just a little further east on 54th Street), I headed over straight away.  The police officers guarding the entrance told me they were completely staffed.  Then he looked me squarely in the eye and he thanked me.   He  thanked  me .  I felt so helpless and small.  He looked so tired.  But he was thanking me.  I turned away and crossed the West Side Highway into DeWitt Clinton Park because I was about to break down.  Once inside the park I sat on some steps and cried.  I can't make sense of what I'm feeling.  I'm not angry at anyone.  I don't want vengance.  I just want to help.  I'm also afraid.  Me, big strong Charlie...I'm afraid.  Earlier today I heard a plane above me, but it was close and it sounded different.  All I could do is stand where I was and stare at it until it was gone.  What's wrong with me?  It was just a plane, I mean, what was I expecting?  I wiped off my face and headed out of the park.  There's a big ballfield in the middle and all the floodlights were on.  This is odd, and I know this park well, 'cause Dex's favorite dog run is there.  But I saw right away why:  AOL has set up a truck there with free access to the Internet for families who need information.  It almost started me off again.  Have I mentioned yet that Verizon, our phone company, made all of their payphones free for the entire City so that we could have greater communication with each other?  More kindness.  I didn't know what to do with myself.  I had hoped I'd be put to work.  I wandered back through the neighborhood and ended up on Eighth Avenue and 48th Street.  That's where Engine Co. #54 is.  They've lost a lot of men, including their Captain.  There are so many flowers and notes piled up that they were higher than my head.  Tons of candles, tons of food.  And tons of messages drawn by the kids of the neighborhood.  "Thank you for being brave."  "Thank you for helping our city."  But get this one:  "To our enemies:  peace & love."  I stayed for a few minutes longer, just trying to be quiet and looking at the pictures of the lost men, giving each of them a moment of respect.  I never wanted to be a fireman when I was a boy, but I want to be one now.  Last night I spent some time with  urlLink Sparky .  I adore Dan.  We'd been chatting online and both of us realized we didn't want to be alone and we didn't want to be home, so we met around midnight at the Big Cup in Chelsea.  We drank a little coffee (actually, Sparky had steamed milk with almond flavoring), walked, talked, had some Krispy Kremes, walked, talked, hugged.  It was what I needed and what I think everyone in this City is craving right now: intimate human contact.  We're all trying to take care of each other in small ways, which are really the only ways most of us can.  But it turns out not to be so small.  I love you, Sparky...thanks for taking good care of me last night.  I don't have anything new to report.  The news has got it all covered.  I haven't done anything brave or useful.  I can't think what to do next, nor what will happen next.  I would say I'm numb, but I'm the opposite: I have way too much feeling.  All that I can do is try and sleep tonight and wake up tomorrow and try and be of use.

       Vigils and Vigilantes  Sorry I didn't blog yesterday, but I promised Jon Jordan I would help him with a project in Long Island City, so I used the day to keep away from the computer and the television and it was a good thing.  But I have to tell you about Thursday night.  Around 10:30 or 11 Thursday night, I headed again down to Chelsea Piers.  I had heard that they needed computer people, at the very least data entry people, so I went to see what I could do.  This time there were no crowds around, it was mostly closed down, a few policemen and some volunteers directing pedestrians.  I explained why I was there and I was directed to an entrance near 19th Street.  This was the furthest I'd been into the Piers since this disaster began, and it had been transformed.  One driveway that normally leads to a parking lot was lined with stretchers and tables of medical equipment and food.  There were a lot of emergency rescue workers waiting around, some asleep on the stretchers, but there was a feeling of anxiety that had been put on hold for too long.  The next entrance was blocked off with police barricades and a long table.  This is where I had been directed to speak to the volunteer office.  All the volunteers wear a piece of thick masking tape on their shirts.  It has their name, what unit they've been assigned to, and when their shift started and is assumed to end.  Everyone wears one.  Some wear more than one.  And some of the rescue workers that had come from Ground Zero had their names and Social Security Numbers written in marker on their arms and clothing.  When it hit me why, I got chills.  I explained why I was there and they seemed surprised but pleased.  The lady at the table, Jill, said she understood they'd just installed a new computer system and I might be just what they need.  I was excited.  She went to check and I waited.  About this time something must've happened downtown, because there was a lot of activity.  Three vans of doctors and nurses were quickly assembled, flanked by vans of police and heavily-armed military personnel.  I was right on the curb as this was happening on the other side of the iron railing, so I was able to see into the vans.  These were the first faces I'd seen in person that were actually heading down to Ground Zero.  They looked determined but also maybe a little scared.  Or maybe I'm projecting.  As I was watching this, I met eyes with one young doctor and I gave her a smile.  She smiled back, shrugged, and got in her van.  I know they all wanted to go down and find people to treat, to keep alive.  I know now they didn't.  Jill came back to let me know that the new system was still not up and running, but they would possibly be ready for input in the morning and she took my name and number.  She also mentioned that at the Armory across town, the central location for families to get information on victims and survivors, might need computer operators to help keep the list of names updated.  I thanked her and headed east to the Armory.  My cab dropped me off a block away.  The Armory, which is normally deserted except for the occasional antique show, was ablaze.  Lights from every news reporter on Earth, families and well-wishers, police, military, National Guardsmen, volunteers.  The Armory was set up with only one way in and one way out, mazes of barricades, and all entrances had a civilian volunteer, a police officer, and a National Guardsman posted together.  For three blocks in every direction, and posted on every surface including the iron fence of the Armory itself, are the homemade flyers we've sadly become used to seeing.  Smiling faces accompany heartwrenching pleas for news, any news, of their loved one.  I've gotten in the habit of reading as many as I can, if for no other reason than it being my only way to give that life a moment of my respect and attention.  Small things, small things.  I got past the first checkpoint and up to the second, when I was informed by the Captain Holmes of the Army that they were closing the Armory for the night.  Apparently everyone was exhausted and they wanted to do a full check of the building, so it would re-open at 8am.  I asked if there were would be overnight staff, and he said the word was everyone was to go home and rest.  I thanked him and worked my way back out of the maze.  I was frustrated as hell.  Here I was ready to work all night, finally finding something I could actually contribute, and  still  nothing for me to do.  I wasn't ready to go home quite yet, so I figured I'd go to Union Square and see the memorial.  Union Square at 1am was packed.  On the 14th Street terrace there were hundreds and hundreds of candles, cards, flowers, poems...well, you've seen them before.  They never made much sense to me.  I guess the memorials created for JFK, Jr. and Princess Diana seemed strange to me, because most of the people bring flowers and notes didn't know them and, ultimately, who was this memorial for?  This time it made sense.  This memorial was for all us.  We were all touched.  It affected all of our lives.  And here was one place to focus some of this energy.  All around the perimeter, people sat cross-legged, alone and in groups, some praying, some meditating, some talking quietly.  There were peripheral groups as well, as I'd learn later, but I wanted to concentrate on this central group.  Suddenly, a woman in a peach gauze skirt, leading a little gray dog on a leash, walked into the circle a bit and introduced herself as a psychic and teacher.  She asked if she could lead us in a visualization to send love to those trapped but still alive.  She said if we all concentrated and focused our good energy, they'd feel it, it would give them hope and perhaps help them stay alive.  This might surprise you, but no one hooted or jeered, no one even snickered.  Instead, almost everyone there closed their eyes and allowed this woman to guide us through her visualization.  And, yes, I did too.  Right on cue, the sky cracked open with lightning and a moment later the kind of booming thunder that's even louder when bounced off all the buildings of Manhattan.  No one moved, no one stopped meditating.  As she finished, someone on the other side of the circle started strumming a guitar and singing.  I looked around at a few of the smaller memorials along the fence, and then heard shouting at a group just a few feet away from the big circle.  I found a crowd intently listening to a young, handsome man who was speaking to them quite vehemently.  He wasn't advocating war necessarily, but he was talking about the need for some sort of strong action.  As I understand it, when 14th Street was the grand thoroughfare of New York, Union Square was a place, much like Hyde Park in London, where speakers would come and extemporize on the issues of the day.  Apparently it still is.  This man was so passionate and spoke so well and so clearly.  A couple of people shouted comments at him, but for the most part the crowd was very respectful.  I hadn't noticed it, but he was holding a white tube, like posters are kept in, and when he was finished, he handed it off to the next speaker.  Apparently, this was the Talking Stick.  Fascinating.  Just outside of this group were two hippy chicks in tye-dyed outfits were chanting for peace.  Suddenly a very average looking, schlubby accountant-type guy started shouting at them.  He was angry that they were being so passive.  He was shouting at them to wake up.  The hippy chicks weren't startled, they even tried to respond, but it started to escalate and I couldn't deal, so I walked away.  The thunder and lightning continued to threaten rain, there were even one or two scattered drops, but no one was leaving the park.  I walked north through Union Square and passed another alter created by the Tibetan community of New York.  Simple, just candles with a neatly typed note stating their purpose. Quiet, contemplative.  I stood with them for a moment.  As I left the Union Square, I turned back to look at all the people who'd come for a sense of community or to make a public statement.  I'd never experienced anything like it.  So much emotion, so many opinions, and yet all peacefully co-existing, even with the volatile tempers.  And I realized the terrorists didn't win.  I know now they can't.  They destroyed buildings and planes and people, but they didn't touch what we're really about.  We take our personal freedoms for granted, but you know what?  That's good.  That means they're so deeply a part of who we are as Americans, we can't exist without them, we just  won't .  Even I would enter hand-to-hand combat for the right to be an opinionated asshole.    It was the first time all week I felt that everything will eventually be okay.

       Looking For Some Peace  I went to the park today.  Central Park.  I figured if I could get as far into the center of the park I wouldn't hear sirens or crying or television reporters.  I stepped out into street and there were so many people.  I was confused.  I couldn't remember if this was the normal amount of people or not.  Do they belong here?  Did something else happen?  I wasn't sure.  Dexter was acting crazy.  Actually, it started to annoy me.  He was biting his leash, darting at birds, stuff he does occasionally, but today more than usual.  But I noticed that people were noticing him.  And smiling.  My goofy dog was being a clown.  I haven't been stopped so much since he was a puppy.  "How old is he?"  "What kihnd of dog is he?"  "Great dog!"  I don't think they cared about the answer so much as they wanted to connect with us somehow.  He got some spontaneous smiles on the street today.  Have I mentioned how much I love this dog?  On the edges of the park, and along Central Park South, more impromptu flyers with people's names, the floors on which they worked, phone numbers to call with information.  All of the pictures used on these flyers are taken at parties, weddings, special events.  The faces are gorgeous, dressed to the nines, happy.  It just makes it worse.  In the park we walked and walked until we got to the Rambles.  I know what you're thinking, but it's beautiful and quiet and it doesn't feel like a city.  We slowed down, Dex chased squirrels, I sat on a rock under a tree and tried to breathe.  I don't know how to meditate, this is as close as I can get.  As we walked on, I heard the sound of a shovel scraping stone.  I instantly thought, why are they searching up here?  It was just a park worker clearing away mud from the base of a footbridge.  But my mind goes right to lower Manhattan.  I had promised friends I'd help them out at their store today, so I took Dexter back home but I was running late, so I called from the street.  Did I tell you that all Verizon payphones have been free?  The phone company has made all their payphones free to help New York stay in touch.  Have you ever heard of that?  I also passed restaurants with signs offering free food and drink to rescue workers.  Everyone's doing what's needed.  The store felt like an old general store.  People would come in and chat, every one of them had stories.  Stranded tourists, nurses waiting to be of use, neighborhood people feeling useless and restless.  We heard stories of Hell's Kitchen.  The fire department on Eighth Avenue at 48th Street has lost about 15 men, this morning their captain was pulled out of the rubble, dead.  The fire station on West 43rd Street has apparently lost every single man.  Every single firefighter from one station.  No one to return there.  Unthinkable.  The nurses were told that a couple more buildings had collapsed, so their transport to the triage center had been cancelled for the moment.  They told us that the Woolworth Tower was expected to fall.  It's such a beautiful building that the thought of it gone made me cry.  So many rumors, so many stories.  There's a billboard in Times Square advertising the Hallmark Channel.  It reads, "Story after Story after Story (no, we're not talking about the World Trade Center."  They are now.  We all know people who narrowly avoided, for whatever reason, going down.  Or those who made it out.  Or those who might not have.  None of us are untouched by this.  We tell stories we've heard from friends, or stories about possible survivors.  But we eventually end in silence just staring at each other.  I ran into two friends on the street, one really just an acquaintance, but we hugged long and hard.  Couldn't talk a lot, but we hugged and looked into each other's eyes and offered assistance wherever, whenever.  And we  mean  it.  It's late now, but I'm going downtown to see what I can do.  Maybe nothing.  Maybe just cheer the workers changing shifts.  Maybe I'll buy water and Gatorade and tshirts.  But if I can do anything, I want to be there.  That's what'll bring me peace.

       Doing What We Can  I just got back from downtown.  Jon Jordan and I made about 50 sandwiches of all kinds.  It was almost an impossible task since no grocery store in midtown has bread.  No bread.  We don't know if it's because people are stocking up at home or if everyone was making sandwiches, but not a single loaf of any kind of bread on any shelf in any grocery store in midtown.  All I'm saying is, whoever ends up with the sandwiches that Jon Jordan and I made got top quality rolls and designer bread.  But then, they deserve it.  I grabbed my big bag of clothes, and we headed to the Javits Center.  First stop, drop off my used clothes.  I actually expected them to take them and toss them to the side.  Far from it.  They asked what I had and they ripped into the bag immediately, yelling the contents and sorting them into boxes that quickly got moved to trucks.  I can't tell you how pleased I was that my clothes were going to be of help right away.   That done, we walked over to the river to walk down to Chelsea Piers.  Chelsea Piers has been set up as a triage center.  As we walked down, we could see that the most recent building collapses had sent more dust and smoke into the air and the wind was now moving some of that smoke uptown.  The core of the smoke remained over lower Manhattan, though.  On the walk down, we passed a lot of military personnel guarding building and street entrances, all heavily armed.  Chilling to think all those rifles and machine guns were loaded.  When we got to the Piers we learned that they were overloaded with food and water and volunteers, but they told us that supplies were desperately needed downtown, mostly at a fire station at Varrick and North Moore Streets.  So we started walking down.  Chelsea Piers is at 23rd Street and the Hudson.  North Moore Street is in Tribeca (the TRIangle BElow CAnal Street...i.e., waaaay downtown).  We would've taken a cab, but there haven't been too many.  Plus, no cab would be allowed below 14th Street, where the City's been sealed off.  We weren't sure we'd be allowed through, since we didn't have any identification showing we belonged there,  but we hoped our food credentials would get us past.  All along 14th Street there are blue police barricades set up.  We approached an officer, told him our story, he checked our drivers' licenses and looked through our bags and let us by.  We were in the Forbidden Zone.  Far fewer people, far fewer cars.  More restaurants open, and many, many more handwritten signs.  Signs directing people to blood banks, signs announcing prayer vigils, signs asking for donations of tshirts, toothbrushes, etc. for workers who haven't been home in 24 hours.  There's a distinct burning smell down there and the dust in the air began to get very thick.  A lot of people were wearing surgical masks or other types of homemade masks to keep the dust and, we now know, asbestos particles, out of their mouths.  We walked with our shirts over our mouths for a bit, but it got to be too much.  I'm still coughing a bit and my eyes are sore.  We walked down Hudson as far as we could, I guess it was about Vandaam, and we were redirected to Varrick Street.  At Varrick we told the officer where we had been sent by Chelsea Piers and they told us we'd need to go to Pier 40 to drop off our supplies.  I have to say, New York's Finest were nothing but.  And as exasperated as I'd normally be, I wasn't bothered.  We had something that we needed to do and we'd go wherever we needed to, to do it.  The closer we got to the West Side Highway, the more people there were.  The highway was lined with people some with flags, some just watching.  But the minute a fleet of rescue workers came rolling by everyone on the sidelines errupted into applause and cheers.  Some rushed out to the cars with bottles of water and sandwiches and energy bars.  The workers in the trucks looked so tired and sad, but grateful for our cheers.  I'll never forget how proud I was to be a New Yorker, standing there supporting those people who've been literally sifting through this nightmare.  We crossed the highway over to Pier 40 where another distribution and volunteer center has been set up.  We couldn't get too close, more barricades, but one rescue worker with a Parks Department shirt on, came out and took our bags and was very thankful.  We don't know who'll end up with our food, but I hope they know that two little guys in midtown are grateful for what they're doing.  After dropping off our bags, Jon was tired.  We had, after all walked over 50 blocks.  I wasn't ready to go home yet, so I put him in a cab and told him I'd call him later.  I started walking uptown.  I wanted to go to Chelsea and see what my people were doing.  Earlier, our mayor had said we should all go outside, try to resume our lives, eat in restaurants, shop.  He didn't have to tell Chelsea twice.  But it was different, dampened.  And there was a spontaneous sidewalk vigil.  All along Eighth Avenue, leaning against buildings, sitting together on the curb, were people with candles.  It was touching.  Not a big deal, just a sign to the world that we were out of our houses and unafraid.  Again, I was proud.  Every restaurant was open, all of them full.  People exchanging information, chatting quietly.  Around 18th Street, a really cute guy caught my eye.  He smiled as we passed.  I looked back and he looked back and stopped.  But I just couldn't talk to him.  I cry at the drop of a hat.  I don't feel particularly attractive or sexual.  As lonely as I feel right now, it wasn't the moment to meet someone new.  That's probably weird, but I have such a sense of loss and mourning that I just turned around and kept walking.  Maybe I'll run into him again sometime.  I kept walking uptown, but started to get tired and needed to see (and feed) Dex, so I hopped in a cab.  At 40th Street we were diverted again, because Port Authority Bus Terminal was barricaded by police.  The cab driver and I took it in stride and took the detour.  At home, Dex was thrilled to see me.  I could smell the dust in the air, hear sirens down the street, there were 8 new messages on my machine.  It's still a war zone.  We're all still shell-shocked.  But we're surviving.  To all of you in other parts of the country, you have to know this:  your thoughts and concern and messages and calls and emails help us feel that we're not alone.  It keeps us from being so afraid.  They mean more to us than you can imagine and we, well I, thank you with all my heart.

       Sign Me Up  I just took a walk down the Hudson to see the view from there.  I wish I could post my pictures because from that vantage point, you can really see the size of the cloud of smoke that used to be downtown Manhattan.  I stumbled on the back of the Jacob Javits Center, our huge convention complex, and it's surrounded by firetrucks, abulances, and rescue vehicles.  What struck me the most, besides the sheer number of them, was the fact that they weren't all New York City vehicles.  They were marked with the names of other surrounding New York State cities and towns, large and small, and several from New Jersey.  I cried to think of all those people coming to help us through this.  You can't believe how kind everyone has been here.  How gentle we're being with each other.  I crossed the West Side Highway to see what was going on there and noticed a two tables where they were signing up volunteers.  One was only for civilians with some medical or fire training and license.  The other was for general volunteers and for civilian search and rescue.  I signed up.  I don't know what they'll need, or even if they'll ever get to me, but how could I not?  Search and rescue could be a horrifying detail, but if I were trapped under that rubble, I wouldn't care who was digging me out or how hard it was for them.  So I hope they call me.  There were all sorts of people milling around the Javits Center.  Rescue workers, some victims, some family members looking for information.  There were two friars in long gray robes and beards, young guys, probably in their mid-twenties, handing out fruit and water and talking to people who looked a little dazed.  I wanted to take a picture of them, just because I wanted to remember their faces, but I didn't want to intrude.  There were some people collecting clothes for the survivors whose clothes were burned or torn and I've come home mostly to grab the back of clothes I'd set aside for Goodwill.  I'm gonna be taking them back down to the Javits.  Jon Jordan and I have bought our sandwich making supplies and we're going to be taking them down to the Chelsea Piers.  Usually a sports complex and a gym, Chelsea Piers has been set up as a temporary medical center, although I understand it's mostly a makeshift morgue.  I figure those folks can probably use a little sustenance at this point.  More later.

      This is a city where people generally go out of their way to avoid contact with other people.  Not today.  People in the elevator asked if all of my friends had been accounted for, told me their friends' narrow escapes.  Walking Dex this morning, I passed people I pass almost every morning, plus a few strangers.  We met each other's eyes as we passed and exchanged a terse, but kind, smile.  Those of us that knew each other on sight but had maybe never spoken much or at all asked how the other was doing.  "Do you need anything?"  I thought I'd stop crying today, but I haven't.    The streets are still very deserted.  Times Square, the Crossroads of the World, is vast and empty.  The lights and neon blink and flash but there's no one to be impressed.  All Broadway shows were cancelled last night, as were all matinees today.  No movies.  Some restaurants are open, some are closed with hastily made signs.  One that I passed said "Eatery is closed today.  God Bless America."  Usually that would make me smirk.  Along Ninth Avenue, there are other signs of support like that, some in just marker that give directions to blood banks.  There's a five hour wait to give blood.  If you can.  One of the places I went wasn't set up for the onslaught.  One had a long list of qualifiers.  I don't qualify -- I'm gay.  But I'm not outraged, just sad that I can't help in that way.  Jon Jordan and I are going to the grocery store in a little bit.  We're going to buy lots of bread and meat and stuff and we're going to make as many sandwiches as we can.  Then we're going downtown.  We don't really know where, most of downtown below 14th Street is sealed off, but our plan is to get food to the people who've been working so hard and so long.  It's not a lot, probably a stupid idea, but I can't sit around crying anymore.

      I just went out to vote.  Today is the mayoral primary in New York City and, despite all that's happened this morning -- maybe even  because  of all that's happened -- I wanted to try and vote.    Midtown is a strange place this morning.  There's very little traffic.  People are streaming down the streets, mostly moving uptown, away from Times Square.  Offices are closing throughout the city, the subways are closed and most buses aren't running, so people are forced to walk.  Even with all these people, it's very quiet out.  No one's really talking and, when they do, it's in hushed tones.  During the several blocks I walked, I noticed that people are walking in groups, staying together.  There are long lines at ATMs everywhere, and I noticed fairly long lines at the two grocery stores I passed.  Coffee shops and restaurants are crammed with people who can't leave Manhattan.  In one window I saw two men, probably in their seventies, staring straight ahead.  I wonder if they were thinking about Pearl Harbor.  Twice there were loud noises on the street, one was a truck backfiring, and everyone on the street froze.  When a siren was heard a block behind us, everyone stopped, turned and stared.  Also, overhead, there was a fighter jet.  Flying over midtown Manhattan.  My sweet friend Allen was trapped in the World Trade Center during the first bombing, and he still works across the street from it.  He was the first person I called and, I'm ashamed to say, I left a slightly hysterical message on his work phone.  I managed to call him at home just after and he's fine, but I was so scared.  I've tried to get ahold of my friends, but phones aren't working well, especially cellphones.  Needless to say, when I got to the polling place, voting had been suspended.  But I tried.  I tried to exercise my right as an American in the face of terrorism and I couldn't.  Just for today, though.  I'm gonna go out again in a little while and try to give blood.  Incidentally, had I taken the cross country trip, today would've been the day of my return flight from San Francisco.  Interesting, huh?

       Meat & Greet  I promised I'd write when I got work.  Well, I'm Bourbon Street's newest homosexual bartender!  I'm working at a little whiskey-soaked nook called  urlLink Lafitte's In Exile  (appropriate, no?), and so far, so good.  But it's definitely gonna be a wild ride.  I have to say, I'm still a little nervous, 'cause it's been awhile since I was behind a busy bar.  However, if last night is any indication, my mixology skills are really gonna be secondary.  I think we're all aware of my severe self esteem issues which wage daily battle with my Attention Whore Deficit Syndrome.  This li'l gig feeds 'em both.  I'll admit it: I'm no dog.  But I'm no  urlLink Michael Bergin , either.  So imagine my complete and utter surprise when I start getting phone numbers on napkins, phone numbers on matchbooks, tips that need to be stuffed directly into my pockets, requests to see my nipples, requests to see my thighs, requests for me to drop my pants, countless inquiries on when my shift was done and where was I going after, and one poor, sweet soul from Texas who wanted (and, thanks to management,  got ), the sweaty t-shirt off my back.  I am not a Go-Go Boy, I am a Human Being!  As embarrassed as I was, though, I also kinda got off on it a little.  I mean, who wouldn't?  All this sudden attention makes me uncomfortable, sure, but no one in New York ever clamored for my sweat-stained garments.  I knew New Orleans was, umm,  permissive , but one utterly cute boy (dark hair, great little body, but verging on alcohol poisoning), after reaching over the bar to grab my biceps a couple of times, hopped up on the bar and pulled out his penis to show me how interested he really was.  I'm not usually at a loss for words, but I don't know the correct comeback to a dick-waggling.  And to make matters stranger, my manager stepped up to help him get his pants down.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I don't know if any of you drink, but it seems to me that too much alcohol makes people randy.  It blurs their judgement.  It decreases their chances of sitting upright on a barstool.  This is the drinkingest town I ever saw, and what I witnessed last night is almost enough to make me stop drinking entirely.   Almost .  Fortunately for me, no one else in New Orleans is even close to entertaining that notion.  I'm gonna try and go with this wave of sudden popularity.  Fresh meat?  Hell, at 39, umm,  35 , I'm happy to be thought of as fresh  anything .  If I can get over my neurotic self, this could be kinda fun.  I just can't buy into it too much, because nothing's more unattractive or boring than that (I refer you to every bartender at Splash).  And one day, very soon, something newer and fresher will appear in our grocer's freezer, and I'll be put on the sale rack.  Until then, what can I get you, baby?

       Le Cauchemar Sur Le Rue Royale  Ooooh, kids, this one is scareeeee!  A chilling tale that will turn your blood to ice!  Not because of the events, but because I didn't have an aneurism.  It'll, like, totally freak you out.  So Friday night, out and about and mocking the TestosterClones, my drinking companions and I ended up at the  urlLink Pub .  We were sitting upstairs, just outside one of the men's rooms, when a cute, furry boy stumbled past.  A few minutes later he stumbled back out and paused in front of us to collect his breath and stop the room from spinning for just a second.  Uncharacteristically (well, maybe not for the new me), I asked him "Baby, are you okay?"  He said, "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine...hey, I know you!"  I thought to myself that on that much K, I probably looked like  everyone  he'd ever known.  Then he said my name.  Turns out he and I had tried a few years ago in New York to date, but our schedules never matched up and then he moved to LA.  Small world.  But nice to run into people out of the blue, just when I'm beginning to feel a little blue.  Anyway, we chatted but he had drugs to dance out of his system and we promised to get together before he left town.    A little later I walked over to the dancefloor to see what was up and I noticed someone was checking me out.  He was damned cute -- blonde, tattooed, sexy smile -- but young.  But cute.  But young.  What the hell, I'd had enough vodka, my Attention Whore Deficit Syndrome was kicking in, and I might as well say hi.  He's Jason, 23, from Austin, Texas.  A little drunk, a lot adorable, and leans into me in a way that's so endearing and a little erotic that I know I'm gonna break my rule and take him back to my attic.  The next morning around 9:30 the doorbell rings downstairs.  This is curious as no one but  urlLink Jonno  ever rings the bell (and he only rings it because he installed it and enjoys his handiwork) and it doesn't sound like his ring.  It isn't, it's a big Dryer Repair Guy from Sears.  Oh.  Hi.  He's here to fix the dryer and do I have the cash.  Gee, no, but let me make a call.  So I run up to get my phone and reassure 23-year-old Jason from Austin, Texas that I'll be right back.  I call Richard who says he'll be over when the Dryer Repair Guy is done and give him cash.  Dryer Repair Guy says he ain't doin' nuthin' 'til he sees green.  I call Richard, who negotiates with DRG and that's all settled.  Then Richard tells me that the Cabinet People are coming at 10:30.  Oh.  Well, that'll all be happening downstairs, no biggy.  One more thing, says Richard, the floors in my attic that are supposed to be sanded and refinished in about 2 weeks?  Yeah, they'll be coming today around 11:30.  Oh. I see.  That will definitely affect me and 23-year-old Jason from Austin, Texas.  Because what it means is that everything in my bed-sit will have to be moved out, including the stove and the iron bathtub, so that the workers will have access to the floors.  Hmmm...  So I toddle upstairs and gently explain to 23-year-old Jason from Austin, Texas (who I strongly suspect is still drunk) that he should probably shower while he can, and maybe put on some shorts, 'cause we're having company.  "Didn't you say you had an interview today," he asks?  Oh.  Right.  My bartender interview at 1pm.  Well, first things first.  I get the coffee started, I get 23-year-old Jason from Austin, Texas into the shower, I start moving some things out of the way, the doorbell rings, I run downstairs to let the Cabinet People in, I run back upstairs, feed the dog, give 23-year-old Jason from Austin, Texas some coffee and Advil, take Dex outside for his morning necessities, back upstairs to continue moving things and get a little coffee for myself and check on 23-year-old Jason from Austin, Texas (who's coffee has now kicked in a little and has become frisky in that 23-year-old way).  It sounds fucked up, right?  In New York I would've been on my third coronary and spewing venom on anyone in a 500 yard radius, right?  I was calm, unflustered and, actually, amused.  Ladies and Gentlemen: the New Zen Me.  Somewhere in all of that, the  urlLink Sturtle  arrived, bringing with him his aura of calm and that helped, too.  There was only minimal mocking of the impromptu nursery school I'd opened in the Attic Royale, and by the time the Floor Guys got there, the furniture had been moved, I was installed temporarily on the first floor, and 23-year-old Jason from Austin, Texas had been pointed in the direction of the Quarter to continue his revelry.  See?  It all gets done or it doesn't, but blowing a mental gasket ain't gonna help.  Even at 39, er 35, I can still learn.  I made it to my interview just fine, thank you, and it's looking like I might be bartending here soon enough (which is excellent, 'cause due to recent banking disasters, Daddy's broke).  I did have one moment that reassured me the New Yorker is still alive and well inside.  As I was standing outside of the bar on Bourbon Street waiting to speak to the manager, an SUV pulled up, the window rolled down, and this  gentleman  asked, "Where's  urlLink Cafe du Monde ?"  Now, I've only been here a week and I've already been asked for directions a couple of times (and was actually helpful), but asking about Cafe du Monde is kinda like asking "How do you get to Carnegie Hall?" -- it's an easy and obvious thing to find...especially for someone with Louisiana license plates.  But New Zen Me told him how to find it, he looked at me a moment too long, winked and drove on.  I thought for a second he'd mistaken me from a rent boy or something, but didn't think too much about it.  Last night, walking home, an SUV pulls up, the window rolls down, and this  gentlemen  asks, "Where's Cafe du Monde?"  Same car, same guy, same hackneyed pick-up line.  I looked at him, blinked, and said "Same place it was when you asked me six hours ago."  He rolled up his window and sped away.  Thank goddess the New Zen Me can still be a bitch when I need to.

       The Streetcar Named Desire Is Now A Bus  I don't remember if I've ever mentioned this before (you don't think I read this blog, do you?), but for the past couple of years I've been a part of the  urlLink VaxGen AIDS vaccine study .  It's not all that noble really, I'm just a big, cute guinea pig, but I wanted to complete the study and, fortunately, there's an injection site here in my new city, so I got transferred.  Yesterday was my first visit with the office at  urlLink LSU Medical Center .  When I called to confirm my appointment, I was given elaborate directions to get there by bus.  I didn't really pay too much attention and, looking at a map, I figured I'd walk.  I'm a walker.  I mentioned my plan to a couple of people who were horrified that I'd (a) walk and (b) walk there.  Didn't deter me.  So I walked, got to see places I'll probably never walk through again (really, there'll be no need) and wound up at the VaxGen office at 11:45 for a 1:30 appointment.  What to do, what to do...I secretly consulted my guidebook (so as not to be pegged a tourist) and realized I wasn't so far from the  urlLink St. Charles streetcar .  No one here really knows me yet, I can travel by that conveyance and never get caught...what the hell.  I counted my change (it's $1.25) and marched my sweaty self over to Canal Street.  Turns out it's not just a tourist thing, residents still actually ride the streetcar.  I rode out all the way to Riverbend, watching the big, old houses glide by.  It was only marred by the older couple behind me, who were Sign Readers.  I'd hear behind me as we passed things, "Rite-Aid," "Randee's House of Beauty," "Liberry."  I mean, what's that about?  Are the old people trying to sound things out as a tether to reality?  Are they just stupid?  But in my new, simpler life, things just don't get to me the way they once did, so I chose to find it amusing.  I rode back, past the Audobon Zoo, past the Belfort Mansion, home to MTV's The Real World New Orleans, past Lee Circle with General Lee facing north so his back will never be to the Enemy.  I see an old city, very set in it's ways, but with a lot of new energy that respects and knows how to work with that.  I hopped off at Canal Street to get to my appointment.  After my appointment, I decided to walk back through the Quarter, which is beginning to fill up with revellers for Halloween.  The tourists haven't begun to annoy me yet, at least not the way they did in New York.  This city exists on two levels also, but the residents seem to move through and around the tourists like the many ghosts that must inhabit the French Quarter.  The two cities touch when they must, but they seem very separate.  Crossing into the Marigny, I slowed my pace even more.  The houses here are quirky, the people have texture...I enjoy my strolls home.  And, yes, the #86 Crosstown Bus Named Desire, passes right in front of the house and I smile every time I see it.  I've got a little Blanche going at the moment, not the least of which is my dependance on the kindness of strangers who are becoming friends.  But unlike Blanche, I'm no longer a tragic heroine, no longer losing my grip on reality.  I'm coming back to myself more every day, liking myself, letting myself like other people.  If I stay here long enough, I just might become human again.

       No Cream? No Bacon? No Problem...  Something's come over me.  Or perhaps drained out of me.  I think it might be tension or dangerously high stress, but I can't be sure since I haven't lived without it for some time now.  But the signs that I'm unwinding and relaxing are all there.  For instance, even after being out with the Glamourati of the Crescent City until 5am several nights in a row, I've been up and alert before 10am with no alarm.  In Manhattan I usually needed to alarms and I'd still wake up at around 1pm.  As a matter of fact, at night when I go to bed, I'm tired, my mind shuts off and I sleep.  Delicious sleep.  Is this how humans live?  [Veering off-topic only briefly, at the Fuz urlLink  zmuffin's birthday feast last night, I had an entirely brown meal consisting of catfish, shrimp, oysters, and something called Crawfish Stuffing Balls.  Just when I thought getting to spend the whole day with him was it's own reward, deep fried seafood...I'm never leaving.]  Another example, the dog now walks faster than I do.  Used to be he'd have to keep up with me, now I'm constantly trying to get him back to my pace.  Yes, ladies and germs, I saunter.  Even in the heavy tourist areas around Jackson Square, I saunter around tourists.  My teeth aren't clenched, I'm not muttering "Move it, Fat Ass" under my breath...I just glide around them and smile.  Or, get this:  I had breakfast this morning at a little place called The Corner.  Half touristy, half local, but it seemed low maintenance and I wanted some eggs and French toast.  I sit down, ask for coffee, the waitress brings it but tells me they're out of cream and half and half and brings me a styrofoam cup with some milk in it.  Whatever, no problem.  Then I order my French toast, eggs over well, bacon and a side of grits.  Oh yeah, no bacon either.  Hmm, okay, sausage then.  She looked at me and said, "You're so easy to wait on."  No waitperson has ever, ever said that to me.  As a matter of fact, several waitbeings on the Isle of Manhattan are probably dancing for joy that I've left town.  But honestly, it didn't matter.  She forgot the grits, couldn't find me a salt shaker that worked (it's humid today) and I still left her a $2 tip.  I mean, she seemed like a nice girl.  Wait, is that Pestilience on the horse behind me?  After breakfast I wandered over to Canal Street to get a cellphone.  I know, I know, I bitched about them, but I need a phone and, well, it makes the most sense.  I will not be answering it at dinner, I promise.  Anyway, Leatrice at the Radio Shack was just as helpful as she could be.  Not a minute under 40, she did her whole sales pitch with a grape Tootsie Pop in her mouth.  She referred to the output jack for the hands-free headset as the "hole thang on the side of the machine" and couldn't have been sweeter or more helpful.  In New York, she probably would've driven me crazy.  Here, not at all.  She made me smile.  I'm a nicer person again.  Probably 'cause I'm not fighting every second. 'Cause people behind you in line offer you a pen when you need it.  'Cause people you've met once say they're glad to see you again and seem to mean it.  In fact, Leatrice herself asked me to come back and see her.  Not only will I, I'll take her a brand new Tootsie Pop!  So I called Jon Jordan (who I'm worried about...he's taking my leaving very hard).  Made a couple of other quick calls to give out my new number.  Grabbed a light lunch (well, the corn might've had a little bacon in it) at my new favorite grease spot, Verdi Marte, and now I've come home to shower and change and I'll be off to look for a job.  I'll basically do anything.  Sure, I'd like to bartend, but I may end up giving ghost tours or scraping out bird cages...who cares?  I'm not stressed, I'm around interesting and creative people who seem to be living lives of their own choosing and design, and I can hear a train and churchbells from my garret window.  And that's what I like about the South.

       There Is A House In New Orleans...  ...and I live in the attic!  Well, it's the upstairs, but I like to call it the attic.  Actually, it's exactly what I needed: unfinished enough to make my own and remind myself that I'm poor, but so charming that I don't care.  My tension's evaporting with every walk I take.  New Orleans seems familiar to me, feels like my beloved Ybor City, but older and wiser and much more of a party girl.  The creative energy here is palpable and exciting.  And everyone I've met has been welcoming and nice and, well, just no goddamned attitude.  Y'know, in New York I always felt kinda hip and sophisticated, but here...I feel kinda square.  But maybe it's just a matter of time.  My hosts, landlords, roomies are beyond swell.  My affection for  urlLink Jonno  is well-documented, but can we talk for a minute about the  urlLink Sturtle ?  He's patient and even-keeled, as kind as he is dry and mischievous, and I have to confess I have a little crush (fortunately, I'm fairly certain he doesn't read this blog...when would he have time?).  Dex and I have been taken in and cared for.  It's the sort of kindness I feel stupid trying to acknowledge, and yet it's saved my life.  Maudlin yes, but I like it, too...  I have much to tell of my journey down.  Tales of fleeing New York, a vomiting dog, Stuckey's pecan logs, my first glimpses of this rare city, and of being Fresh Meat.  But that'll have to wait as it's a holiday weekend here (Jonno's birthday, naturally) and I've not been home before 5am since I arrived Friday afternoon, and I'm pretty sure there's been alcohol involved.  As a matter of fact, my very first night was all glamour and big hair at the infamous Shim Sham Club, where I was very much welcomed to the Big Easy by these  urlLink notorious   urlLink diarists .    I hope you'll all take a moment on Monday, October 22nd to pause and reflect on the birth of Our  urlLink Saveur ...I'll be buying him bourbon and soda.  In the meantime, my new life has begun:  I'm In Exile on Royal Street.

       Open Letter To New York City  Don't be mad, baby.  Look, it's not like we're breaking up or anything.  I just think we need some time apart.  I need some "me" time.  We've been together a long time.  I know you're feeling it, too.  It's natural.  So I'm just gonna go South to get my head straight, relieve some stress.  But you know I'll think about you every day.  When we met, I was still a kid, but you'd been around.  And you had plenty to teach me...but I like to think I taught you a thing or two.  We had a lot of fun then, remember?  Nothing was really serious.  You'd throw big parties, we'd stay up all night, you'd have people over from all over the world, celebrities.  It was glamorous and carefree.  But we've both changed.  I mean, frankly, the last two years you haven't reached for the tab once.  I don't mind paying every once in awhile, but this has gotten out of hand.  And all the cosmetic changes?  There are parts of you now that didn't exist when we met.  Yeah, there've been good things, too.  I know you like the back of my hand.  I know your moods.  I know how you get around the holidays, and especially right after.  I know how you like to spend a Sunday morning, all sleepy and quiet and reflective.  The way I can sometimes turn a corner and you'll catch me completely by surprise.  And how you pull through in a crisis.  But you can be too much for one guy.  I'm tired and I need a little break.  But you know I'll be back.  How could I stay away from you?  I grew up with you, became a man with you.  You taught me how to take it on the chin and laugh at it later.  Let's face it:  you're the love of my life.  You sigh and give me that look right now, but tomorrow you'll be busy and it'll almost be like I was never here.  Almost...but not quite.  And when it gets to be five in the morning, quiet as hell and no taxis 'cause their shifts are changing over, the time you used to walk me home from the clubs.  Think of me.  I Love New York.

       The Long Goodbye  Over the weekend I managed to get rid of a lot of stuff.  Big stuff.  King-sized stuff (well, at least the bed was).  I'm beginning to have a lot of "last time I'll..." moments, too.  Friday night whilst I was covered in dust and doghair, packing things for  urlLink Sparky's  arrival on Saturday to move things to the Rumpus Room, I got an impromptu call from  urlLink The Minx  to join him in a cocktail.  While I didn't think there was room in such a small glass, I hurriedly cleaned up and walked over to meet him.  We met at the  urlLink much-blogged-about  Barrage, which was packed.  I have to say, I wasn't so much in the mood to be in cramped quarters with a lot of chatty fags, but I didn't think I'd get another chance to say goodbye to Chad.  And I'm glad I did, although I was only good for one drink.  We even got to see an aspiring dj that we'd both dallied with.  But, as I had much to do and Chad's parents were in town, we headed out.  Walking up Ninth Avenue, getting filled in on New Orleans, I looked down a side street and saw an old friend, someone whom I'd actually understudied  urlLink Off-Broadway , and wanted to say goodbye to.  Chad left me there and I snuck up on Ray for a big hug.  I guess this is as good a time as any to mention two things.  First, the Universe or Whomever has been tossing me people and places to say goodbye to, or at least to have one last glimpse of.  Or maybe just to stir a memory.  Either way, a lot of my 18 years is being placed at my feet to either admire or stumble over.  It's fascinating.  Second, I've learned that when you tell boys you're leaving town, you instantly become The Most Desired Guy in Manhattan.  Boys are freaks.  But more on all that later.  Anyway, I got to see Ray and his lover of (get this) 26 years one last time before I go.  They're hilarious.  A very showbusiness couple, in a hilarious way.  I adore them.  We walked a bit, promised to try and have dinner before I leave (which looks unlikely) and promised to keep in touch, etc.  This saying goodbye thing isn't so easy, after all.  I mean, I knew I was really leaving when I tossed away my trove of take-out menus, and that was hard enough.  But saying goodbye to people really drives home the point.  I really don't know when I'll see any of them again.  Some of them perhaps never again.  I won't just stumble across them on Eighth Avenue, they won't be on my block on the way to the Ziegfeld.  And the goodbyes are just gonna get harder.  I tried to pack a little more that night, but, as it was my last night in my glorious king-sized bed, I thought Dex and I should just relax and enjoy it.  I think he might miss it slightly more than I will.  After all, it was the first big thing he ever learned to jump on, because it was the only thing that separated us at night.  And he can have his snugglebunny moment, then retreat to a far corner and snooze.  And when will I have another bed that sleeps a Brazilian soccer team?  Ah, the memories...  Saturday morning I got up and got right to work breaking down the bed.  I moved it into the hallway and suddenly my bedroom was the size of Kansas.  Now, I thought, it's beginning to look like I'm moving out.  Sparky was right on time, bearing coffee and sugary delights (as if he himself weren't sugary delight enough for any man), and we got his stuff down to the street and waited for the man with the van.  More like freak in a zebra-painted truck, but he got the job done (Sparky's a patient, patient man).  So now the Rumpus Room is equipped for the Brazilian soccer team and I, in exchange, have a sleek, new laptop to take with me to NOLA, rather than the sad Etch-A-Sketch I've been using at home.  And, as a bonus, while we were unloading and assembling,  urlLink Ralph  played me some New Orleans-inspired music and answered my inane questions about the place.  Scampering back to Manhattan, a little more packing, then off to dinner at the Polish Tea Room (aka Cafe Edison) with Jon Jordan.  Jon's working on the new Neil Simon show "45 Seconds From Broadway," which takes place at the Edison, so it was a logical choice.  My last taste of their matzoh ball soup, chopped chicken liver, corned beef on extra soft rye.  Please tell me there are Jews in New Orleans, and at least one of them can cook!  I dropped Jon back off at the theatre, more packing for me, then off to meet  urlLink Mike  and his friend Not Nick at, where else, Barrage.  I got there slightly before they did, and had three "I can't believe you're leaving me, I have a big crush on you, let's get married" experiences.  I'm sure at least two of them were fueled by Cosmopolitans, but still...it was slightly uncomfortable.  Especially when someone's saying he can't believe you're leaving him, and then making out with an escort on the other side of him who he may or may not have been paying for.  I was told that a screenplay had been written with me in mind and I couldn't leave until it was shot.  That someone else was sure with enough time I'd come around and we'd be together always.  I was never so happy to see Mike and Not Nick!  We sat in a corner and blabbed for awhile, me flirting a little with sexy Not Nick, until the pressure of All Things As Yet Unpacked began to crush my skull and I had to flee.  Michael, we'll continue our conversation over a to-go cup on Bourbon Street...  On the way home I ran into two other people I hadn't see in ages, one I knew and we chatted a minute, the other I've never met but have had a long time crush on.  In fact, his picture was once in a local fag rag and I cut it out and pasted it on my computer.  It's still there.  I thank the Universe for one last glimpse.  Where am I?  Sunday?  Ah, yes, Sunday.  Because I haven't had enough hauling and packing and disassembling and taping, I promised  urlLink Choire  I'd help him with some light chores (for a small fee, naturally).  But first, my ex and his new husband were coming by to pick up my favorite piece of furniture.  I looked long and hard for an old armoire that I could use as an entertainment center and finally found one that I adore.  I couldn't bear to sell it, but it's just to big to put in storage.  Paul and Matthew agreed to buy it, move it and, if I ever move back and still want it, I could buy it back from them.  So I know my baby's being taken care of.  Of course, choosing a Sunday to move furniture turned out not to be so good for renting U-Hauls, so they showed up with a mini-van.  Yes, you're right, mini-van's  do  have seats.  Apparently the fold down, but when they drove away, half of my armoire was sticking out of the back.  He came back a little while later and picked up an old wooden wheelchair from the 30s (don't ask why I have it...I'm kooky, okay?).  Then another, harder goodbye.  Backstory:  The day that Paul and I ran into each other at the theatre, a week after we'd met briefly at a New Year's Eve party, I'd been in such a hurry to get ready that I'd just glooped up my hair with some shiny gel product that smelled of citrus in order to tame my wild head of hair.  Later that evening, when we were making out in my apartment and he'd gotten a generous amount of said gloop on his hands, I felt his hand on my lower back.  "Don't think I don't know you're wiping your hands on my shirt..."  We laughed and it became one of our inside jokes.  Sunday morning:  After getting the wheelchair into the van and giving me a Coach leather collar for Dex (it didn't fit their dog), he looked at his hands and said, "Ugh, I'm so dusty and I have to go up to a teacher/parent meeting."  I was already grungy, so I told him to clean them off on my tshirt  "Don't think I don't know you're wiping your hands on my shirt," he said quietly to me.  It was all I could do to not fall down.  He'd not only remembered that long ago moment, but he was saying goodbye in the only way good ol' not-sentimental, only ever be happy Paul could do it.  I waved, but I had to get inside fast.  Thank you, Pongo.  I managed to pull together my weepy ass and get downtown to meet Choire.  An adventure I'll let him blog about.  But we did have an amazing dinner and then, helpless kitten that he is, he let me talk him into not only getting coffee at the Big Cup, but sitting down to drink it.  He looked like a caged animal in there!  Highly amusing.  We wandered down Eighth Avenue, looking at the gays and their clothing shops, down to 14th Street to look for duffel bags for me, which became a high-pressure sales pitch from a Badu-headress-wearing Dominican saleswoman that I think I want to be when I grow up.  Sadly, after looking at their selection and realizing it would just be one more thing to stow once I get to New Orleans, I left empty handed.  Choire had the brilliant suggestion of just using garbage bags, which I hadn't even considered.  "You haven't been poor long enough," he told me.  Oh, really?  Sure as hell feels like it.  We got to about Fifth Avenue and I knew I had to go nap and start on the mountain of laundry calling my name on 54th Street.  Is this really where I'm gonna say goodbye to Choire?  Here?  We hugged, said a little goodbye, he rendered me a check for my services (I'll just let you all believe what you want to about that), said some highly unmemorable stuff, and walked away.  But Choire?  Thanks.  Most obviously, thanks for pushing me to blog.  It cracked my world open and let the future in.  But thanks for the hundred small things that I've forgetten to thank you for, or even the ones I already have.  Thanks for not feeding the drama queen.  Thanks for telling other people I'm good.  Thanks for telling me, too.  Thanks for making me go see that movie about Mexican dogs.  Just thanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanks.  We have some weird connection, you and I, but I enjoy the hell out of it.  We really are the most improbable friends.  But from our online chats, to the Flatiron Building, to Ralph's you've helped me to stay afloat these past few months and I hope someday I make myself worthy of your friendship.  I love you.  I've gotta go now...I'll blog more later...

       The Best Little Warehouse  Tuesday it all went into storage.  Most of it, anyway.  At 9am, two movers and one fairly big truck came to haul away my boxes and crates and bags full of books and clothes and kitchen stuff and Goddess knows what else.  And, believe it or not, it all went pretty smoothly.  I was determined to make the two and a half hour minimum for the move, so at about 7am I started moving stuff downstairs myself.  My building (soon to be my  old  building) was built in the early twenties, so it has an old, manually operated service elevator.  As Choire had predicted last Sunday when he came over to taunt me as I packed, some of the boxes were overstuffed and structurally unsound.  But it's amazing what extra packing tape can do.  I was dripping with sweat by the time the movers got here, but I'd cut there job in half, so they pretended not to notice I looked like some sort of manic convict.  Even though most of my belongings were in boxes (but clearly marked...I am a Virgo, after all), it's a strange sensation to have people walk by them, appraising them, asking if I'm moving, wondering how many boxes there are, is any of it for sale...  I felt a little like Scrooge watching his belongings being picked over after his death.  But finally the last of it was being loaded onto the big truck and I called Jon Jordan to let him know I'd be picking him up in a cab so we could meet the movers at Chelsea Storage.  Ah, Chelsea Storage.  Right on the West Side Highway, Jon and I used to bike by it on our morning rides.  It's massive.  Floors and floors now of storage units of different sizes.  We determined what size I'd need and Jon and I went to go look at the unit.  The first they showed us had a window in it and I was concerned that it might break and rain or snow all over my rare books.  So they showed us a second one and I took it.  8x10.  A fitting size for an actor.  We filled out the endless paperwork and went up to move things into the space.  An interesting thing has been happening during my remaining time in the City.  Much like Scrooge, I'm being reminded of people and places that have passed through my life during the past 18 years.  The trip up to my storage unit is no different.  In order to get to that part of the warehouse, you have to walk through what used to be The Tunnel, a nightclub I used to frequent as a lad.  I was disoriented at first.  I mean, we'd been walking through brick warehouse and suddenly the walls are painted silver, there's the dj booth, the dancefloor, the former Kenny Scharf room...all kinds of memories were attacking my senses.  That's the spot where Stephen and I chatted with Michael Musto, who was clutching a straw purse with big plastic flowers, for 40 minutes until he realized he really didn't know us and then just walked away.  The dancefloor where I really learned to love Junior, and where I once took two straight boys for their first taste of Manhattan clubbing and drugging.  The Kenny Scharf room where for some reason I got free drinks all night and where we'd go to recover a bit from the mayhem of the dance floor.  And here I was strolling through this in the middle of the morning, around the time I used to leave, on my way to put my life into a container so I could leave New York.  Very strange.  Up on the sixth floor, the movers were already starting to put my stuff into the new space.  I, of course, wanted to do it all myself (I had a Magic Marker in my pocket ready to re-label for easy identification and access.  Also, since I knew what was in which box, I wanted to make sure things were stacked properly and sensibly.  Now, I know I was in a little bit of a hurry towards the end of my storage packing (I'm still packing what I'm taking and what I'm tossing, plus a second, smaller wave of storage), but I guess somewhere I'd packed a  urlLink Furby  (don't ask) but forgotten to remove his batteries and everytime that particular box was jostled, he'd started muttering and gurgling.  Initially, the Jamaican mover hadn't wanted to touch the box, assuming (probably rightly) that I had some bad mojo in it.  Well, after I told Jon and the movers that they should just go, since I was only gonna shift boxes around, he was the only company I had.  If it got too quiet, I'd just knock the box and he'd start singing and babbling.  It probably should've been annoying, but I kinda enjoyed the company...he was certainly more coherent than many of my previous companions at The Tunnel.  About an hour later, I stepped back and looked at it all.  The better part of the last 18 years, neatly boxed and labeled, and I didn't understand it any better than I had before.  But at least it was now safe.  No one could come to my apartment and toss it out onto the street because I hadn't paid rent.  I breathed a smallish sigh of relief, closed the door and snapped the lock.  As I was waiting for the elevator to come, all alone on the sixth floor of this huge warehouse, I could hear Furby sneezing and muttering to himself.  As surreal as it was, it made me laugh.  At least my life's not boring.  Got back to the apartment, looked around and...well, it didn't look that much emptier.  Still a lot of furniture and papers and clothes and so much dog hair I could knit my own litter.  But a big chunk, an important chunk, was out of the way.  One more step closer to being a resident of the fine State of Louisiana.

       Packin' It In  Guess you're wondering where I've been.  Me, too.  Seems it took Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome to get me moving, but finally...I'm moving!  In another week or so, I'm throwing my clothes, some belongings and a freaking adorable dog into a Dodge Intrepid and I'm driving to Louisiana.  It had to happen.  This apartment has been too expensive for far too long, but losing my long term temp gig really killed my financial picture.  And can I tell you how lousy terrorist activity is for the temp industry?  So all I've been doing is pushing scented candles for $7/hr, and, well, that barely keeps me in designer drugs.  I need an apartment I can really afford, in a city where I can get a job that keeps me afloat but doesn't eat my soul, where I can simplify and detox and reassess.  I kept thinking about that little bachelor apartment sitting empty, with the world's  urlLink sexiest  and  urlLink most stimulating  (intellectually, you pigs) landlords, and so I picked a date.  Just like that.  And my new life awaits...  Funny thing is, although I've had moments of anxiety and it's a scary thing, now that the decision is made, everything seems to be falling into place to make it an easy move.  Jon Jordan is,  of course, being a rock.  Even though I know it's painful to him for me to be leaving.  But he's going to loan me a little cash to get my stuff in storage and he's gonna rent the car for my drive down (noooo, the rental company won't take my green dollars, they have to have a credit card...whatever).  Within a couple of days I got a coupon in the mail for 50% four months of storage and another that waives the drop-off fee for a one-way car rental.  My lease and my gym membership are both up in November.  Seems I'm meant to go South.  I'm ready.  Trust me, though, there's messiness to be dealt with.  Back rent that probably won't be paid (don't cry for them, they're gonna triple the rent on this apartment), things still to be packed, sold, stored.  A strictly pedestrian dog to be acclimated to a long car drive.  Some of it's being dealt with, some of it's just gonna have to take care of itself.  Though it won't be entirely behind me once I'm out of here, it's all gonne be much, much better.  Simpler.  And more humid.  So that's it, that's my news.  Consider yourself updated.  Now I've gotta get some junk packed so I can haul it down to  urlLink Chelsea Mini Storage .  More soon.  Really.  In the meantime, if you have anything interesting to tell me about my new home, I'm all ears.  And if you'd like to sponsor this move, I'm all pockets...

       In No Particular Order...    Parking my bike on Royal Street the other night, I hear the sound of shattering glass.  I hop back on my bike and ride up to the next block to see what happened.  Turns out one of the galleries had its front window smashed.  Yes, it was  that   urlLink gallery .  The weather's been unexplainably beautiful and it's lightened my mood considerably.  I'm also very happy with The Universe because my beloved Jon Jordan, having had all his close friends leave New York for one reason or another, is having his fourth (4th) date tonight.  It seems Jon Jordan, Dexter, and I actually made it onto the screen in "Kate & Leopold."  Don't blink.  Michael (for that's my new beau's name), is quitting smoking and it's been a roller coaster ride of moodiness.  He's to be forgiven for all that because (a) quitting smoking is admirable and difficult, (b) he's adorable and can get away with pretty much everything and (c) he helped me get:   urlLink MY NEW BARTENDING JOB !!!!!!

       Out of the Wood  So there I was on Halloween night, bartending at  urlLink Lafitte's in Exile , watching the costumed parade of freaks stumble down Bourbon Street.  (Now that I think of it, years ago, I started my first waiting job in a Greenwich Village on the night of the Halloween parade...I hate/love freaky coincidences.)  It was a long, frustrating night, after which I found myself without a single dime, because I was still considered a trainee (they even made me wear a badge that read: "Trainee, Be Nice To Me").  I mean, what kind of management throws a trainee behind the bar on one of the busiest nights of the year?  Ladies and Gentlemen, Honored Guests, I present you with the villains of our piece:   urlLink Wood Enterprises .  Started by former male prostitute, Tom Wood (although some people mysteriously know him as "Noah"), Wood Enterprises owns three gay bars and two greasy spoon diners in the French Quarter.  They're also well-known throughout the Quarter as the most hateful collection of bitter queens ever to run a business.  Almost anyone you meet in Gay New Orleans has been through the Wood Enterprises mill.  It's almost a badge of honor to have survived working for them, and listening to people talk about their lengths of service sound like rodeo cowboys bragging about their times clinging to a raging, bucking bull.  Anyway, they're a mean and petty organization, and I rode that bull for almost three months.  After about a month at Lafitte's -- enduring the sexual harrassment of  urlLink Kenneth , the manager (and former Thibodeaux, Louisiana meter maid), infuriating schedules (although, as I learned, people  do  come in to drink at 7am), and constant encouragement to treat bar patrons as though they were coming through the gates of Disneyland, rather than a dark place where they're coming to get drunk and, possibly, laid -- I was offered the opportunity to work at another of the Wood bars,  urlLink Rawhide 2010 .  It seemed like a good idea, at the time.  Everyone I talked to about it thought I was a natural choice to work there.  The manager, an oafish bear named  urlLink Barth , seemed excited to have me there, and the uber-fey upper managers would rather sit and sip their cocktails in the other, more genteel (and age-appropriate) bars.  So I grew in my biker-esque facial hair and leather jeans and started behind the bar at "New Orleans' Premier Levi/Leather Cruise Bar."  But, ummm,  oops ...it's not a  Leather  bar, it's a Wood bar.  I soon learned that, in an effort to get Barth to quit (so they wouldn't have to pay him unemployment...yes, folks, they're  that  cheap), they'd reduced his salary by a rumored 25%, and so he'd given himself two of the best shifts behind the bar.  I'd have to work between  urlLink Randy , a terrific, much-beloved bartender who's been at Rawhide for years, and Barth, the Dancing Bear who would practically grab people out of my section and take their drink orders.  Frustrating, no?  And having your manager behind the bar, competing for sales and tips, seems somehow wrong.  I was told my sales were too low.  So when customers requested that I take off my shirt, I did.  And as soon as Barth realized why people had stopped coming to him for drinks and instead were taking the awkward, blocked route to my section, I was told that working without my shirt was against company policy...I  must  wear a shirt with the Rawhide logo (Barth lied about this coming from him and tried to pin it on upper management).  Well, I got one of the tight, black tank tops and worked in that...and my schedule was cut back from five days to three ("low sales" on my register being the official reason for the cut back).  Barth lied about having made up the schedule, or even knowing anything about it.  Finally, this past weekend, the national tour of "South Pacific" was in town.  I have a number of friends on this tour and told them all to come in and see me.  Saturday night the place was hopping with people who were only buying drinks from me.  I had a ball.  Got to talk about shows and New York, got to see familiar faces, I was busy, I was laughing, and I got perspective on the whole stupid situation.  My friends would look at Barth -- clapping and dancing for attention, banging his foot against the back wall to attract customers, shouting out for drink orders to customers who were just passing by on their way to the bathroom -- and look at me with that "what the hell's wrong with him?" look.  Sometimes when you're stuck in a freaky situation for too long it starts to resemble the real world and it takes a visitor from the real world to reframe everything.  Saturday night was the most fun I had working at Rawhide.  And I outrang Barth.  Sunday night when I got into work, there was a memo on all of our lockers, the gist of which was only Rawhide t-shirts with sleeves and black denim jeans would be allowed behind the bar and anyone wearing anything else would be considered out of uniform and sent home with a written warning.  I, of course, am the only bartender at Rawhide who occasionally wore black leather jeans (which were much-admired by Barth in the beginning).  And I will also immodestly state that I am the only bartender at Rawhide who could fit into a tank top, much less look good in one.  So that, plus the news that my schedule had been cut back to two days, convinced me that it was time to leave.  Sunday night at Rawhide 2010 is "Scary-oke Night."  Yeah, they set up a karaoke machine in the middle of a leather cruise bar and big, fat leather bears sing Britney Spears.  I. Kid. You. Not.  Not only is it a night that made my ears bleed, but (and I can't believe a money-hungry management like Wood Enterprises hasn't noticed this) all drink sales slow waaaaaay down the minute karaoke starts.  Not so good for tips.  Barth always, vainly, sings the first song.  Tonight it was to be Cherry Poppin' Daddies' "Zoot Suit Riot" for some unfathomable reason.  Just before he was about to start, I went upstairs, gathered my things, wrote on my cash sheet in big block letters "I QUIT," went downstairs, approached Barth and said loudly something like "You lying, spineless manatee, I fucking quit," threw my register key on top of his enormous gut and turned around and walked out.  I remember him looking quite startled and then he had to jump right into his song.  Now I'm a free agent, looking for a new bartending gig quickly 'cause I'm broke.  But I feel lighter and happier than I have since I got into that whole Wood Enterprises mess.  Yeah, yeah,  urlLink you  warned me...  As I said, though, it's a badge of honor and the night I quit bartenders all over the Quarter bought me celebratory drinks.  I've been through the worst of it, work-wise, and I don't think I'll have a problem getting a new gig.  And, frankly, I'm glad I got the Wood Experience.  Got some cash, lots of stories, lots of lessons...  ...and, oh yeah:  I got a boyfriend out of it.

       Star Diner  About a week ago, walking down the other end of Royal Street, at the other edge of the Quarter, my eye caught a painting in the window of one of the galleries.  There are so many antique shops, curio shops, art galleries, photo galleries on that part of Royal I almost don't even look anymore.  I stop to see the old lamp shaped like a palm tree with a brass monkey sitting at its base, or Bette Davis' cigarette case, but for the most part the frustration that's grown and fed the depression which has returned keeps me from taking in the odd bits of beauty displayed in all those windows.  But the thing that caught my eye that day, as I was hurrying to a cheap, fast food lunch on Canal Street, was a large canvas featuring an elevated subway car rumbling through what I imagine to be some part of downtown Brooklyn.  It was an urban thing, a familiar thing, that stopped my mind, briefly, from rehashing the latest petty nonsense that's been part of my daily thought pattern since I started bartending for this particular company.  I looked at it for a moment, not recognizing the scene, but warming my soul on the New York-ness.  Then I looked at the canvas next to it.  I felt almost dizzy.  I was absolutely disoriented for a second.  I looked around me, at the other shops, the tourists with beads, Bank One across the street, then I looked back at the painting.  I moved closer to the window.  Another urban canvas, but this one quite familiar.  Seventh Avenue, looking downtown.  Completely uninteresting, not an unusual time of day, no great building detail, I don't even remember seeing people in it.  Uninteresting, as I say, except for this: the painting is taken from the northeast corner of Seventh Avenue and Fifty-fourth Street.  The very corner I lived on for the past 12 years, or so.  The very corner.  It was like I'd stepped out of my old New York apartment building, ready to walk Dex or go to the gym, and looked towards Times Square.  There across the street is the Star Diner (overpriced, but a great tuna melt), beyond that, though abstract in this work, I could name every shop on both sides of the street.  I stared and stared at it, trying to make sense of it.  I haven't written here for months.  I haven't written for many reasons.  I've yet to settle in here and I can't say I've been as happy, or as prosperous, as I'd hoped, but I'm still working at it.  I long to return to New York, but not to the life I was living.  This painting, not just a New York scene, but   my   New York scene, practically meaningless to anyone here but me, seems to be a sign of some sort.  A message sent just to me.  But  what is  that message?  I don't know exactly, but it's stirred something inside of me and I'm behaving differently.  Feeling differently.  Better.  I would never, in a million years, have believed that the Star Diner could be a symbol of some portent, but there it is.  And they serve a helluva tuna melt.

       urlLink   ...The Greatest Of These Is Charity  My  urlLink ride  pulled up to the emergency entrance of Charity Hospital, opened my car door (an officer  and  a gentleman), and removed my handcuffs.  "Don't run or I'll lose my job," he said.  Run?  Why would I run?  He had my driver's license and I had no intention of having to stand in  that  line again.  True to his word, we walked right to the front of the line to the Triage Nurse.  Past the head wounds, past the stomach pains, past whatever was bleeding on the Hispanic woman that was making her moan and hold her shoulders all tight.  Didn't seem right.  I explained to the nurse what my issue was, she took my temperature and blood pressure and I was apparently normal enough to move on to the next waiting room.  As we were leaving triage, I heard them mention that a three car pileup on the Mississippi River Bridge had victims headed into the emergency room.  I apologized outloud to no one in particular about wasting resources.  No one cared:  I was officially crazy.  The next waiting room looked like one of those sets on  urlLink St. Elsewhere  in which the family of the leading patient sits and frets.  Dingy yellow tile halfway up the wall, brown stains meeting it from the other directon, uncomfortable chairs from some 70s buying spree, no reading material, a very tired security guard, a nurse/receptionist reading one of those "A Prayer A Day" booklets they sell at the checkout at Winn-Dixie, and two other "patients" dead asleep across the room.  My Li'l Officer handed my paperwork to the security guard and, with a sheepish smile, backed out of the door and my life.  Men.  They handcuff you once and never call you again.  I was asked to empty my pockets and remove my shoes, and I was inspected thoroughly for anything with which I might do myself harm, which turned out to be the chain on my wallet and my cellphone.  I was invited to sit, so I sat.  And I waited.  It was now about 11:30pm.  I'd first talked to the cop around 10:45.  This was getting stupid.  It was about an hour before a Pakistani doctor came down to ask me a few questions (though he refused to answer any), take my vital signs, and disappear.  I asked if I could use the bathroom, but was told I couldn't go unescorted and the security guard had to stay and watch the other two "patients."  I was offered a little plastic jar and the privacy of an adjoining room, but I declined the humiliation.  Another hour went by and I made friends with the little plastic jar.  By this time I was up and pacing.  The nurse/receptionist asked me if I was okay and I unloaded my story.  "Oh honey, you just need to explain that to the folks upstairs, and you'll be home in half an hour."  Oh.  Okay then.  Fine.  I'll just be patient.  Pacing probably makes me look a little manic, anyway.  Okay.  Good.  About 1:30am, I'm escorted upstairs to the Third Floor.  As we got out of the elevator, the nurse that accompanied me produced a ring of keys and unlocked a set of heavy double doors leading to a long hallway with another security guard posted at the end.  As we passed him, she told him my name and he seemed to be checking it off a list.  Then she unlocked another set of double doors and I was admitted to a slightly more modern, slightly more ominous waiting room.  Let me just say this:  when they have to lock to sets of double doors, it's never a good sign.  "Have a seat, dear."   Sure, but what exactly is the process at this point and when can I speak to someone who's in a position to release me? "Have a seat and relax."   I'll be happy to, as soon as you answer my questions. "We don't answer your questions, you answer ours, dear." Please, please don't speak to me that way.  I see several signs that explain Patients Rights posted right behind you and I'm sure upon closer inspection we'll both notice that I have the right to ask questions and to get answers about my status in this process.  She stopped what she was doing, looked up at me, and explained that I was to speak to one of the staff psychiatrists for an evaluation and at that time the process would be explained to me further.  I thanked her most politely and took a seat.  There were three magazines there:  Health, Home Decorating, and, of all things,  urlLink The New Yorker .  The most current issue.  Huh.  I guess I shouldn't've been that surprised that an Alqonquin Round Table freak should find himself in the Cookie Jar reading a magazine that was made famous, in part, by the writing of one of the  urlLink 20th Century's Most Famous Suicidals .  But, whatever, it helped the next hour and a half pass...  Around 3am, I speak with a Dr. Nieves.  Latina.  Non-English Speaker.  A psychiatrist who doesn't understand the subleties of the English language but in who's  manos  my immediate future lies.  She asks me if I'm suicidal.  I tell her the truth: no.  She asks me if I'm homicidal:  I lie: no.  She asks me if I'm on any medication, if I have a family history of suicide, if I hear voices telling me to do things, if I have tingly sensations anywhere.  I try to stop and tell her my story, but she's not interested:  she's got a form she's got to fill out and I'm not gonna stop her from filling it out with my crazy story.  Terrific.  So I decide to be a good boy, be rational, 'cause it's all gonna get straightened out.  I give her  urlLink Michael's  phone number and I know he'll have calmed down and I'll be out of here in no time.  In the meantime, I didn't get to finish " urlLink Shouts and Murmurs ."  About 4am,  La Doctora  tells me that they have no beds for me and I'll be transferred to West Jefferson.  I'm sorry?  No, no...I live fairly close, I can get a cab I won't need to stay the night but thank you.  My friend, she tells me, has caused her to be concerned about my mental stability and I'll be transferred to the Behavioral Medicine Unit at West Jefferson Hospital as soon as an ambulance can be arranged.  [Deleted text of insane phone call to  urlLink Michael  from patient phone on Third Floor of Charity Hospital]  I watch CNN.  I watch a patient get restrained.  I watch a man get  urlLink Breath-O-Lyzed .  I re-read the John Lahr review of " urlLink Take Me Out ."  I get my temperature and blood pressure taken.  What I don't do is sleep, even though I've been up since 10:30am, because the chairs aren't so comfortable and the restrained guy is screaming about milk or elk or something, and so I pace and sit and look more and more like the crazy person they suspect me to be.  Then in breeze two EMTs with a stretcher.  They're very nice.  The guy's not cute, but he's kind and the dyke, who's asking me questions for her form, is all dykey and normal, and I get that feeling again that it'll all be over really fast now.  So I lay down on the stretcher (for insurance purposes only), they strap me in, we go out the first set of locked double doors, they give my name to the security guard, out the second set of double doors, down the elevator, into the ambulance, and onto West Jefferson.  Wherever that is.  TO BE CONTINUED...

       Gay, Interrupted  Buckle your seat belts, kids...  So, Monday evening I'm out having looking for a job and while I'm sitting in  urlLink Voodoo , in walks my friend Boan, who promptly begins to buy me drinks.  Clearly I'm anxious about my job search, not to mention  urlLink Michael , with whom I acted like an idiot the night before.  So we drink.  My phone rings, it's Michael, we exchange words (or maybe I did) and I hang up.  Very dramatic, I am.  We drink more.  Boan goes home and I'm sauced up and anxious.  Of course, I go to Michael's apartment.  We talk.  Sort of.  He's mad at me (and he should be).  I'm mad at him (and I should be).  But we love each other and we're trying to negotiate across the chasm of emotion.  I get disproportionately upset and storm out (I'm very dramatic, I said).  Here's where it starts to get sticky.  I head to the river.  There's a  urlLink stretch of park  there with benches; it's generally quiet and a body can think.  Michael and I walked along there on our first date.  As I'm storming over there, he calls me again.  I start pushing buttons.    I gave Michael the impression that I was suicidal.  For the record, this time I wasn't.  I've had those thoughts, as some of you may remember, but being a Virgo, i.e. an over-analyzer, I then worry about all of the follow-up details and the idea dissipates.  But he didn't know that.  He didn't know that what I wanted was to worry him so he wouldn't be so apathetic to my pain.  He also had no idea what would follow such a call to 911.  I want to be clear about this:  he was trying to help me.  And I was being an asshole.  So, we have a mildly-intoxicated, pretty agitated Charlie, heading towards the river.  I notice that there's a guy in a car slowing down by me, then he starts making threats out of his window, then he stops his car.  Not good.  I'm in a part of the sidewalk blocked by a levy wall and railroad tracks and I can only go forward without encountering this creepy fellow.  So I call 911.  I've never called 911 before, but I'm a little nervous (the Quarter's not all that safe, I'm afraid).  I tell the operator what's happening, I describe the guy, and she tells me where to meet the cop that she's dispatching.  So I walk until I get to a place where I can cross back away from the river and towards the cop car that I can see has just arrived.  I get to the car and start telling the officer what's going on, even starting to give the guy's license plate number.  As we're talking he gets a call on his radio and steps a few feet away to listen to it.  He looks up at me, says something intp his radio and walks back to me.  "I know this is gonna sound crazy," he says to me, "but would you put your hands on the back of the car?"  Cue  urlLink Inner Circle .  "Are you out here to kill yourself, sir?"  What?!?  No, I tell him, of course not, that's crrrrraaaaaaazzzzzzzyyy.  "I hate to ask you this sir, but will you put your hands behind your back?  I apologize, sir, I'm sure we can get this cleared up right away."  And that was the first time I'd ever been handcuffed while fully dressed.  As the cuffs are going on, I see Michael run up.  "Thanks, Mike," I yelled.  Nastily.  I get in the back of the cop cruiser while the young officer goes over to talk to Michael.  Well, at least he'll tell him what's up and I'll walk him home and maybe, maybe we'll laugh about this tonight.  The officer gets back in the car and, to my surprise, turns the key.  Ummm...where are we going exactly?  "I have to take you to  urlLink Charity , sir.  You'll talk to someone there and I'm sure they'll let you go right home."  Oh fine.  Wait a second,  Charity ??  The welfare hospital emergency room on a full moon?  "Yes sir."  Oh Lord, we'll be there for hours.  "No sir, I'll walk you right in...I'm sure you'll be out of there in no time."

       This Is Going To Be Good  I've had an altering experience.  Something big, seemingly bad, but ultimately, I hope good.  Something weird and, as has been obliquely mentioned by  urlLink A Certain Someone , disturbing.  But I've got to get my thoughts together before I write too much about it.  Besides, while the  urlLink Mr . &  urlLink Mrs . Roper are away, I have a brace of hounds (and one very vocal cat) to walk and feed.  But, seriously:  Watch This Space.  It's gonna be bad...but good.

       Finality  Even though we've separated and reunited several times (most recently separated for the past few months), my ex and I have been trying to negotiate a fragile friendship that was generally confusing to one or the other of us (not to mention innocent bystanders).  But we care about each other and it was worth the trouble.  I actually think we were on our way to a reconciliation.  But now...well, for the moment let's just say that's not ever gonna happen.  What's confusing to me is why I feel like I wanna die.  Yeah, I love the guy, but I'm not at all convinced, given our time together, that it's the relationship I should be in.  I have serious trust issues with him (which seem to be proven out).  And both of us being hypersensitive, we argue all the damn time about absolutely nothing.  But he's the person that I've spent the most time with this past year, he's been my primary support system, and I'm already feeling the loss.  I barely slept last night and now I can't get out of bed to go look for my sorely-needed job.    I guess it's time to go on one of those dates I've been asked out on, but haven't gone on out of respect for The Boy.  Respect, apparently, never really entered into the equation.  But first I'll make some coffee, shave, and pretend I have an interest in my life.  I forget...is it Depression, then Anger?  And how many more stages before Acceptance?

       Nekkid At The Cement Pond  Slinging gin at a  urlLink Clothing Optional-Mostly-Homo-Pool-N-Sundeck Type Bar  has been the greatest college summer job I never had.  During the season it was a hopping place and it was kinda nice to get up in the morning, open up the clubhouse (which is actually a big, old house built in the 1800s), have some coffee and make frozen concoctions for cute boys.  And since I was mostly working days, it allowed me to do a play at night, which was an added bonus.  It’s been a learning experience.  Like all bars in New Orleans, we have our assortment of characters.  Monday is Service Industry Day, intended for other bartenders, waiters, hairdressers, etc., to get in free on their day off and relax, but generally it’s Tranny Hooker/Go-Go Boy/Drug Dealer Day.  Which is fascinating.  I mean, to discuss brand-new breasts with what really ought to be one of the most beautiful girls you’ve ever met knowing that if you peek down a foot or so you’ll see the penis that she won’t cut off because she makes more money with it...well, I can’t ever say that’s an experience I ever had in New York.  And it’s fun to tell beautiful go-go boys “no”...they hear the word so rarely that it baffles them.  I’ve also noticed a few things a few things about nudity.  For instance, a lot of people are very, very comfortable with themselves and their bodies and they really enjoy nude sunbathing.  I admire these people, for I’m absolutely not one of them.  Basically, if you’ve seen me completely naked in a public place there’s been an excellent explanation, like you go to my gym or something (and I don’t think either of the gentlemen who actually paid for it read this blog).  Now the rest of the people who get naked in public, it seems to me, have an Agenda.  And it may not be sex, but trust me, there’s a point to it.  They’re Naked With an Agenda (NWA).  After Labor Day, few people come to the pool (even though it’s been really lovely weather and the sun’s been nice and hot and not too direct... lot like my ex, now that I think about it).  When I got in today there were exactly two patrons.  Not good.  And they were both NWAs.  After about a half hour, though, two more gentlemen wandered through the front door and, even though I had showtunes playing, I distincly heard the soundtrack to “Deliverance.”  They managed to scare the other two in about half an hour (Ultra-Aggressive NWAs) and then proceeded to wander around creepily.  One of them even sat down at our out-of-tune baby grand and played something classical.  Once they realized that they were gonna be the entire crowd for the evening and that their nakedness would get them nowhere, they asked me directions to Baronne Street (another upstanding establishment which is holding a Blackout Party tonight), got dressed and left.    And now I sit here alone with my blog and my dog.  I’m grateful that Brian and John, the two regulars who get drunk on Miller Light and Hot Damn (which they refer to as “Happy Meals”) aren’t here.  Or Rusty, the bartender from the Sheraton who gets loaded and tells me what’s right with the South and then falls so deeply asleep on the bar that you just have to wait for him to wake up before you kick him out.  Or Shequeeda, who drinks what she likes to call a “Golden Shower” and when she’s had one too many (and you never know when that’ll be) she starts screaming at unsuspecting patrons about how horribly racist they are and tries to undress.  It’s just not pretty.  Which leads me to ask:  what the hell am I doing working at an empty, clothing-optional pool in October?  I’ve stayed too long at this particular fair and if I’m gonna get my ass back to New York, I’ve got to go looking for yet another job in New Orleans.  But, first, perhaps I’ll go lock the door, do a shot, and float in the pool naked one last time, no agenda needed.

       Someone Else's Year  Just got back in from  urlLink The Gym   (although most people use the facilities for a completely different workout, lately it really is just my gym).  I ran into a friend of mine there, a guy we'll call "Mac."   I was worried about Mac today because as I was walking Dex, we passed by Mac's ultra cute apartment on the Rue Royal and noticed a sign tacked on the door and, being the Nosy Parker I usually am, read it and learned that he's being evicted.  But instead of being at home packing up the last of his things (since the sign says he has to be out tomorrow at 10am), there we was swathed in terrycloth, pupils as big as a hootowl, trawling the hallways of Le Club (as  urlLink Another Member  likes to refer to it).  I guess I'm not all that surprised.  It's an arc I've seen several times in my year here and I'm lucky it's not mine.  I'll tell you what I know about Mac's.  He moved here just after I did, looking cute, young, blonde with bright blue eyes and a lanky, muscular frame.  Smart and personable with an irresistable Carolinian accent,  he got a job at the bar where I'd been working and built up a following of customers and admirers.  He eventually started dating one boy steadily, a choice I which startled me since Mac's new beau was a Full-On Party Boy.  I didn't see Mac for a couple of months, but when I finally did he looked a little haggard from the partying.  Still cute, but all those sleepless nights were catching up with him.  He had, however, gotten a promotion at the bar and was now assistant manager.  Kiss of death.  He lasted another few weeks and then got fired.  Somewhere in there he also had a nasty breakup with Party Boy v1.0 and upgraded to the lastest version.  This led to way more partying, with a more intense crowd, but now minus income.  The next time I saw Mac, before  urlLink Decadence , he'd lost a ton of weight, had that haunted look behind his eyes, and he informed that he was now a "Freelance Party Coordinator."  You know, an "Unlicensed Aromatherapist."  Oh fine, have it your way:  he was dealing drugs.  But only, he assured me, only through Decadence or until he got another bartending gig.  He showed up at my  urlLink bar  a few times after that, with his hardcore entourage, all of them a little spaced-out and looking like they could use a sandwich and a nap.   Well, tonight he told me that the real reason he wasn't home packing up the last of his things, was that a neighbor had told him that two narcotic agents had shown up asking for him and were still parked at the end of his block so he was waiting for the "all clear" before he headed home.  He was also having a friend check to see if there was a warrant out for him.  Before he went back up to his room to smoke a little more  urlLink crystal  to help him forget, he told me he was probably gonna be moving out of New Orleans.  He just had no willpower he said.  "How do you do it?" he asked me.  Just fucking lucky I guess.  Okay, so it's not all that depressing all the time, but, man-oh-man is this a familiar story this year.  I've met more hustlers/drug dealers/crackwhores than I can count.  And they're almost always pointed out to me with the accompanying phrase, "You wouldn't believe how cute he was a year ago."  I'll tell you this much, it made me do my cardio that much harder tonight.  So now my friend/ex-boyfriend/whatever-the-hell-he-is-at-the-moment is microwaving our latest low-fat meat discovery from Super Wal-Mart (my big addiction) and then I'll need a drink.  But just one.  I swear.

       525,600 Minutes...  So where was I... where was I ?  Oh, right...I moved to New Orleans.  Exactly a year ago today.  People here ask me, "what brought you to New Orleans?" and I generally reply "a Dodge Intrepid."  Mostly 'cause I'm a smart ass, but, honestly, how does one say "'cause I was at the end of my rope, drowning in debt, depressed, and I had to go somewhere and  urlLink Jonno  and  urlLink Richard  seemed to have a nice attic?" without depressing everybody sitting at one's bar?  Besides, one thing I've learned this year:  There are no simple answers.  I've also learned a couple of other things.  Like, for example, my patterns don't understand state boundaries and follow me everywhere.  And that I'm a Yankee (actually, I'm worse than a Yankee -- I'm a New Yorker).  I've turned 40 and learned how freeing that is.  I've sadly learned that French fries, French bread, and mayonnaise can be considered a  urlLink sandwich .  Honestly?  I'm glad I came.  I've met some bizarre people, had some interesting experiences, enjoyed the dubious glamour of being a Bourbon Street bartender, been able to take my dog to work, dated a hot 28-year-old boy, walked home through the French Quarter in the fog lit only by gaslamps, bought a  urlLink 1973 Dodge Dart , and appeared in a production of  Dirty Blonde  with a  urlLink New Orleans Legend .  Do I understand my life any better?  Probably not.  Has my debt situation improved?  Not so much.  But I stopped the hemorrhaging on both fronts and I might even have the beginnings of a grip.  Not so bad for a year in the Deep South.  Now it's time to work on getting back home.  Some of that involves finding a new job.  My  urlLink current job  has effectively ended with hurricane season, and Daddy needs cash.  But part is sorting out my experiences, and blogging has always been bery, bery good to me.  So, Blogdom, I want back in.  For various reasons, I abandoned this soapbox/forum/therapy and I wanna correct that.  I want another bite of that  urlLink Cheese Sandwich .  I wanna rekindle that ol'  urlLink Spark .  I want that touch of  urlLink Minx .  I wanna understand how extraordinary the  urlLink Unextraordinary  can be.  I wanna feel  urlLink Young  again.  I wanna get high on  urlLink Ethel .  Can Charlie come out and play?

       Another Damn Day of Nothin' Up  A whole week and, well...nothing, really.  I applied for a job I can't really talk about yet, started a part-time job that's not worth talking about, worked out, didn't goof off too much (no money for goofing).  Maintaining.  Someone told me earlier tonight it's the beginning of my midlife crisis.  Could be I suppose, but how, exactly would I characterize the last couple of years?  My pre-midlife crisis?  It's not good, it's not bad, it just is.  It's cooler here in the Big Sleazy, which feels great; feels like Autumn.  But it's interesting to watch all the Southern Folk freak about it.  I mean, 50 degrees and I saw mittens.  Please.  The change in temperature makes it feel more like home to me and anything that tethers me to Earth these days is welcome.  Of course, no one wants to visit the Homosexual Pool on days like this, so I sit here alone with my Dog and my Blog.  I'll close up soon, take my five dollars and buy some flame-broiled chicken, go work out, visit Michael at  urlLink work .  Won't be further ahead, not too much further behind.  Just the calm before the midlife crisis...

      Y'know how sometimes you leave the gym and you've got it stuck in your head that you want a steak or maybe a big, greasy burger and so you go to an all-nite diner where you know they at least have the greasy burger part and then something gets it into your head that maybe a country fried steak might be even better and then there it is right on the menu so you decide to order it and it arrives all deep fried and battered with two eggs over well and some grits and even a biscuit and you're free with the butter 'cause you know tomorrow you're going back to mostly protein shakes and it's all really good and  urlLink someone else  even pays for it and you leave all full of fat and satisfied and then you get home and lie down and you're still thinking about that damn burger and you know you've blown your burger shot for the next few weeks if you're ever gonna lose those pesky pounds and all that's stretching before you is some chicken breasts and protein shakes and why didn't I just have that damn burger?  I hate it when that happens.

       Everybody Wants To Be The Duck Lady  Although I've never encountered her (she retired to a nursing home before I moved here), I've heard of  urlLink Ruthie the Duck Lady  since I pulled into New Orleans.  There are photographs of her all over, a local market/restaurant has a papier mache statue of her, and I've met several people who swear they were her best friend.  But Miss Ruthie herself no longer roams the Quarter, bumming cigarettes and Budweisers.  No matter, they're lining up to take her place.  I guess the French Quarter's always been known for its eccentrics.  But,  honestly , some of them are just trying too hard.  Sometimes I'm sitting in  urlLink CC's  on Royal and St. Philip, relaxing with a cup of Crescent City Blend, and all of a sudden I hear a rooster crowing.  And I'll  look up to see The Rooster Guy, who is, basically, a guy who wanders around with a little rooster perched on his shoulder.  There is also a Rooster Gal, although I'm unsure if it's the same rooster.  And Sticks the Clown who is always dressed as a clown, has clown makeup tattooed on him, but doesn't seem to be affiliated with any circus and doesn't even seem all that funny.  These aren't (or don't seem to be) homeless people, or even street performers.  They're not even the guys who paint themselves with silver body paint and pose for change.  They're just...just...colorful extras.  That's in my movie.  I guess in their movie, I'm a dull extra.  But New Orleans seems to have a preponderance of these kinds of people.  Kooky outfits, multiple piercings, excessive tattoos, beads and dolls and tchatchkes glued to their bikes or cars or heads.  UberGoths shrieking in the streets as they give their Haunted Tours.  Voodooiennes.  Overdone gender-benders.  It's not  that I don't appreciate the rich tapestry of life here.  I do!  And I completely enjoy unique, original, quirky personalities (I live with  urlLink two  of  urlLink 'em , and I might marry  urlLink another one , fer crissakes).  But  Miss Ruthie wasn't trying...she just was what she  was .  Becky Allen's only being  urlLink Becky Allen .  The people I run into here that are purely, and strangely, themselves fascinate me.  The rest just plain annoy me.  Let's face it (and, do forgive me): the Faux Duck Ladies are all Quacks.

       All The Cookies In The Jar  Enough about me.  Let me tell you about a few of my fellow nutburgers that I encountered at  urlLink West Jefferson .  There names have not been changed because they’re just too crazy to read blogs.  Besides, they don’t have access to shoelaces, much less computers.   Laurie :  Laurie was my favorite, mostly because she was the only other reasonably sane person with whom I could converse.  Of course it took a few hours, because she was detoxing from heroin.  I was envious of her because, as she had presented herself for admission, she could be openly disdainful of everything, whereas I had to continue to be a good boy to support my sanity plea.  Laurie very much looked forward to her methodone, but I think she was even more addicted to her eyeliner.  She swore that several of the male nurses had hit on her.  Laurie refused to make paper plate masks.   Pamela :  Poor, poor Pamela.  I don’t know how she ended up in West Jeff, but I do know that she was already feeling better.  In Meds Group (there were several group therapy sessions that we had to attend throughout our structured day, and Meds Group was a place for us to discuss freely our concerns and questions about our meds...I, sadly, was given no medication so I sat quietly), she told us that she knew her medication was helping because she wasn’t seeing snakes come out of people any more.  Nurse Mary was glad that it was helping, but she wanted Pamela to know that the snakes she saw were never real.  "You know that, right Pamela?"  "Yeah, yeah...I know they weren’t real...except for in a couple of people."  Pamela had many, many questions about her various meds and, while she wasn’t particularly coherent on most fronts, she was able to identify by color and Latin terminology each and every pill she popped.   Adolf :  In Life Skills/Coping Group, we went around the circle and introduced ourselves.  Adolf introduced himself as "Son of God."  I was pretty sure he wasn’t, but you never know who’s gonna have powerful parents, so I was nice to him.  During the course of my Unfortunate Incarceration, they changed Adolf’s medication three times and with it his personality.  I am sad to report, however, that all three personalities were equally crazy.  I voted Adolf "Most Likely to Maime a Social Worker with a Juice Straw."  I've got to take a little break here and talk about juice straws.  I arrived at West Jeff at around 6:20am.  I was unbuckled from the stretcher and allowed to walk in (although, swear to goddess, the dyke said to me "Just don’t run away, I’ll lose my job.").  I was taken into a little room where an overtired nurse went through my wallet, stuffing everything back in haphazardly, took my keys, cellphone, wallet chain, and shoes and shoelaces – lest I do myself in with one of these items.  Yet, before I was shown to my room, I was taken to the Sun Room (the blinds in which were perpetually pulled shut) where I was told I could have all the coffee, tea, milk, and/or juice that I wanted.  The juice was packaged in  urlLink those little boxes  that I’ve only ever seen five-year-olds drink from.  At Robert’s Fresh Market they have a whole aisle dedicated to them.  Each box has a wrapped, mini-telescopic-bendy straw attached, which you poke through the foil hole on the top of the box in order to extract the juice inside.  But here’s the thing:  in order to get through the vacuum-sealed foil on the box, they have to make one end of the mini-straw very, very sharp.  I was surprised by the point on the thing.  I really could’ve used it to carve my deranged credo into someone’s flesh.  It took me a couple of minutes to figure out how to work the little straw – knowing that hundreds of kindergardeners do it every day gave me the motivation to pursue, and I got it in the box without drawing blood.  But, I thought to myself, Here I stand with blue paper scuffies on my feet because I might braid my shoelaces together and they give me the Straw of Death?  I didn’t mention it to anyone, but I did save a couple.  As a matter of fact, I saved almost everything I got in there:  I’m gonna make a collage (or as Jonno said, "Out of pain, art").  Anyway...   Joan :  The New Millinium’s Poster Gal for Mad Housewife.  I think there's a good chance that she faked whatever she had to fake to get a couple of days off in the Cookie Jar.  Okay, maybe not.  Although she did fade in and out a couple of times because of her medication, I never really got a handle on why she was in there.  I heard something about having to restrain her in the ER, and when her daughter visited she wouldn’t talk to her, but she mostly seemed worn out, bored with her life, and glad someone else was cooking (the food was awfully good...I believe it was  urlLink Sodexho Marriott  that was catering my madness).  Oh there were others, and maybe eventually write about them, but it's starting to make me a little sad.  The staff seemed worn out, very into their routine, and unfazed by the craziness.  A couple of them, the least likely candidates of all the nurses and social workers, actually seemed to care about what was going on.  One of them hit on me.  One of them really tried to connect with me.  One was very nice and interested but had a checklist to get through.  One was crazier than most of the inmates.  Microcosms everywhere and not a drop to drink.  Jesus, this story just keeps on going, don't it?  It's starting to keep me from writing anything else here.  And really, there's a lot to write.  Like calling poor Jonno in the middle of his festive birthday luncheon with the "secret code" he'd need in order to contact me (otherwise they'd deny I was in the loony bin).  Or all the mental somersaults I turned figuring out how and why I was there.  The group where we each created the booklet "All About Me" and shared special things about ourselves, ending in a big circle, arms joined together, shouting at the top of our lungs "IT'S ALL ABOUT ME!!!" as though we were the last reel of an  urlLink ABC Afterschool Special .  It was funny and tragic and bizarre and deadly serious.  And, all in all, I probably, on some level belonged there and I definitely got some benefit from it (although not the benefit intended).       The bottom line is I was released on Wednesday around 4pm.  That makes a total of 41 hours in captivity.  You just don't want to be held against your will anywhere anytime.  You have places to be, things to do, and when you express that, you get patronized.  And the more of a fuss you make, the crazier you look.  Best to relax, fake sanity.  Pretend to be the most rational.  Monitor your language (ever notice how many times, on a daily basis, you say things are "insane" or "just kill me now" or similar things?  ...you do in the Crazy Hut.).  Just get all Zen and be right where you are until you're not.    And I learned, as  urlLink Edna Ferber  did about being an Old Maid, it's "like death by drowning, a really delightful sensation after you cease to struggle."

        Now  You Tell Me...  And so the long goodbye continues.  I'm not working, so in between packing there's a lot of goofing off time.  That's generally not a good thing for me, but in this very small town, I keep running into friends and acquaintences who ask if I'm really leaving and then invite me for impromptu coffee/drinks/walks/dinners.  Great meandering walks along the Mississippi; a pseudo-surprise farewell cocktail party from my former colleagues at  urlLink The Country Club ; all-night Quarter prowling...   They tell me they really wish I weren't going and seem genuinely sad about it.  Wow.  Okay. Swell.  But where were you when I was so damn lonely?  Yeah, okay...the truth is, having a weird bartender's schedule and an insular, co-dependent relationship prevented me from exploring some of these friendships the way I would've liked to.  I've barely seen my Beloved  urlLink House  urlLink Mates , other than the odd siting in the hallway.  But, of course, with my damaged self-esteem, I really believed most people down here either didn't  get  me, or didn't care to.  Now that I'm going, I'm finding I was just being stupid.  It's sorta like all of those people who, once it was clear my ex and I would finally stay exes, came out of the woodwork to tell me they never understood why I was with him and proceeded to tell me many fascinating anecdotes about him.  Enlightening and, in a very real way, helpful in getting over him, but why didn't they help me out sooner?  "Well, you can't tell someone while they're  in  it."  Really?  You couldn't have tried?  Would I have listened?  So now it's suddenly spring and I'm finding New Orleans beautiful again.  Interesting, fun people are expressing sadness at my leaving.  I'm thinking I might miss this place.  But I'm a New Yorker and that's where the rest of my life is, I'm sure of it.  I sat in Jackson Square this afternoon, something I've done maybe twice since I moved here, absorbing the weather, the cathedral, the azaleas...watching the tourists, understanding it like a local, but knowing at heart I'm really not.  They tell me I'll be back.   urlLink Becky Allen  is sure of it.  A month ago I would've denied it.  Vehemently, even.  Now?  Who knows.

       Blogged Down  If you peeked in on this blog recently and got a dialogue box asking you for a password and you were wondering what exactly you were missing...the answer is:  nada.  I'll explain eventually (if you really care) why I put a password on this thing, but the reason(s) no longer exist so you're free to snooze your way to blog-bliss.  I was actually gonna start a new blog, figuring after all this time I'm the only one who remembers me, but  urlLink Big Daddy  assures me I should stick with this one and since I heed every third thing he says, here I'll stay.  But that's just in blog terms.  IRL I'm not staying here.  In New Orleans, that is.  I'm going back home...my beloved Manhattan!  It should all be done in a matter of weeks and, while I'm having minor panic attacks organizing the details, I'm thrilled to be delivered from this Deep-Fried Third World and back to NYCivilization.  More as it develops.  Thanks for noticing.

       Taste Like Ya Mama's  I'm on the Shrimp Po Boy Farewell Tour of New Orleans...  Seriously, I'm out of control.  Barbequed oysters wrapped in bacon at Eric & Becky's birthday party?  Pile 'em on.  A double helping of Red Velvet Cake?  Who am I to say no!  I can't say no to food.  And since I'm not working I decided not to splurge on a gym membership these last few weeks.  It's not pretty.  But it is damn tasty.  There's this place I've avoided.  Laughed at the signs, and the prices, as I drove by, but forced myself never to stop.  Had to keep that figure.  But the other day I thought, I'm leaving, what the hell...and now the seal is broken.  My friends, the Devil lives at  urlLink Chicken Box .  Home of the 1000 Pieces.  Yes, 1,000 pieces of chicken for $299.  Mostly, though, I just get the 5 pieces for $1.99.  It's baaaaad.  I crave the grease, the crispy skin.  Last night, at around midnight (Chicken Box is open 24 hours), I snuck out with the dog, ostensibly for a walk, but ended up in the car driving for Satan's Li'l Snack.  I felt dirty, like I was driving to a meth lab for a fix.  Dex almost lost his life by getting his nose a little to close to my chicken.  I want it again tonight.  Please, please get me out of the South.

      I just spent my entire lunch hour in  urlLink Grand Central Station .  It's always been a beautiful place, but thanks in large part to  urlLink her , it's breathtaking.  Really.  I got a salad in the Dining Concourse and found a table towards the Madison Avenue side, propped up my new  urlLink book  and then almost forgot about, absorbed by the activity around me.  Of course Grand Central was packed.  But, as always, it wasn't loud -- it wasn't quiet, either -- sort of busy-muted.  I didn't -- couldn't -- rush through my lunch, the way I always tend to.  So many confused tourists.  Fashionable East Side, or maybe Croton-on-Hudson, Ladies.  Secretaries with earphones, porters with luggage, businessmen with clients on the way into the Oyster Bar.  Most of it happening at top speeds.  And soo many cute boys.  Made me wanna fall in love there.  Very " urlLink Brief Encounter ."   The vaulted ceilings of Gustavino tiles and clean, polished marble heightened the romance of a salad and Diet Coke.    I literally spent an hour and ten minutes in Grand Central just to be in Grand Central.  Wandering.  And this on what may well be our last spring-like day in Gotham.  I want to have lunch there every day.  I wanna live there.  I wanna meet a guy at Custard Beach and have him ask me for a drink at  urlLink The Campbell Apartment  and propose to me by the Information Booth and have our commitment ceremony in Vanderbilt Hall (reception to follow at  urlLink Cipriani Dolci ).  No, really.  But I can't hang around the Terminal after work.  My friend Brent is starring on  urlLink Broadway  tonight and I'm going.

      Children, did Daddy ever tell you that he once worked in  urlLink Bloomingdale's ?  Ah, yes.  It was a long time ago, when Starbuck was just a character in  urlLink Moby Dick  (and  urlLink The Rainmaker ) and Tower Records sold records.  I'm temping today at Park and 59th Street, just around the corner, and as the City is this dual place for me these days -- my once-again-always-was home and the place I grew up, full of ghosts of people and relationships and edifice and artifice -- as I wandered back into this neighborhood for the first time in a couple of years, it took me right back to that kid in the '80s.  My roommate at the time, Kevin, whom I knew from Tampa, was working at the Aramis counter.  He looked like Christopher Reeve and he wore WilliWear and I thought he was so chic and sophisticated.  I stopped by the Aramis counter to say hi one afternoon, and on my way out of the store, I noticed they were taking applications.  Well, hell...why not?  I landed in the gourmet section.  Now, most of you think of Bloomingdale's as the fah-fah, chi-chi store it is today, but it really started out as a sort of neighborhood department store, and as part of that it had a deli and a liquor store (with it's own house brands of hooch...imagine slugging back Bloomie's Gin?).  By the time I started there in '83, it had gotten a little tonier, but a lot of the die-hard customers were still the same old neighborhood housewives, except now they were on Social Security.  Hence, I had on one side little old Jewish ladies asking for tongue ("Madam," I'd say, "I don't know you that well) and on the other side Liza buying Black Forest ham and fresh New York State chevre.  It was groovy.  When the newest issue of  urlLink Interview Magazine  would come out, Andy Warhol would wander through, accompanied by an Asian assistant loaded down with copies.  Andy would silently point at someone, and the assistant would step forward and hand that person a copy of Interview, and they'd move on.  It was bizarre.  Once, though, Andy pointed at me.  I think I was wearing my PopSwatch and possibly my clear hornrims, either way, somewhere I still have that copy of Interview that Andy didn't touch.  One of my regular customers was  urlLink Natalie Schaeffer , who lived around the corner at Beekman Place.  She showed up at the counter, picked out a few items and wanted them delivered.  "The name is..."  "Natalie Schafer," I finished.  She looked startled, expecting someone of my generation to have said Lovey Howell, I suppose.  "Aren't you clever?" she cooed.  I told her that I'd loved her in "Molly and Me" and old Gracie Fields film shot in England before she'd moved to Hollywood.  She always looked for me from then on.  And she was adorable.  I learned a lot at Bloomie's.  I learned about exotic, stinky cheeses and ridiculously expensive white truffles.  I learned to tell the difference between  urlLink Beluga, Sevruga and Ossetra  and that  urlLink foie gras  is delicious in the morning.  I learned Olivia de Havilland doesn't so much care for liver mousse and that it's wrong to try and keep the wax paper she spit it into.  Good times.  I don't think I've eaten as well since.  Jim, the Executive Manager/Buyer for Gourmet was a former actor, and he made sure that food that was gonna go bad anyway, ended up going home with us kids.  So there I was sharing a 500 square foot L-shaped studio with Kevin, but eating  urlLink filet mignon en croute .  One Easter we had cornish game hens with a delicious rosemary cream cheesey stuffing under the skin, so when they were baked they got all melty and gooey.  There was also one of the first Mrs. Fields' Cookies in our section and at the end of the night, Mrs. Fields insisted that all the cookies get thrown away.  The manager of Mrs. Fields was addicted to triple creme cheeses, so we'd trade St. Andre for White Chocolate Macadamia.  Did I mention I was barely 20 and had the metabolism of a greyhound?  I left Bloomie's to go to my first summer stock gig in New London, New Hampshire.  I got quite the care package for the trip up.  After summer stock, I went back for a short period, but eventually went to Macy's to push Aramis with Kevin.  And now the Gourmet Section no longer exists.  Alexander's across the way is gone, too.  As is Fiorucci on 59th and the Woolworth's on Third and, for that matter, Natalie Schaeffer.    At lot of 1983 Charlie no longer exists either.  I was interesting then.  Funny.  Excited.  I wore WilliWear for crying out loud.  I shopped at Antique Boutique.  I walked down the street pretending to be in my own Freed-unit musical.  Maybe that's all a function of being 21.  I don't feel 41, but I sure don't feel 21.  I have a bad habit of staring through windows and seeing vividly what used to be there.  Is it possible to do that with myself and find some renewal or is it just glamorizing the past and trying to avoid the present?  Either way, I sure wouldn't mind eating foie gras for breakfast again...

      Ah yes,  urlLink My Little Lotus Blossom , I remember well the day I won you in an internet raffle.  We met in the shadow of the Flatiron Building.  I wore a pink shirt.  You wore someone else's pants.  We had dinner.  You smoked.  Later, I had an allergic reaction to your fabulousness and you put me in a cab.  Pink shirt, blue balls, runny nose.  Good times.  As if there were any doubt about it:  the boy can kiss.  If we had an Olympic team for it, he'd be on it.  But that talent is counterbalanced by his deplorable taste in doggy snuff films.  Still, if I had to do it all over again...

       Exotic  I write to you from the 47th floor of the MetLife Building,  nee , the PanAm Building.  I'm temping.  It's been ever-so-long since I temped, it's positively exotic.  I feel like I'm playing secretary, which, of course, I am.  I'm making a whooooole lotta money for sitting at a desk answering phones for an extremely handsome lawyer from Madrid, sipping coffee from an expensive machine in which one places a little sealed K-cup of ground coffee (selected from a bank of 20 different kinds, flavored to Kona) into a drawer in the machine and an individual cup is brewed.  Delightful!  A little while ago I descended to Grand Central's dining level and selected a savory little Spanish lentil and chorizo soup (in honor of today's attorney) and a grilled chicken Caeser sandwhich.  So very legal secretary!  I only wish I'd been wearing a copy of a copy of a copy of Dior.  I remember hating this so much.  The unpleasant analysts, the disorganized lawyers, the hapless secretaries terrified of the unpleasant analysts and disorganized lawyers.  But distance, as it will, has lent enchantment, of sorts.  It's kinda cute being at work when everyone else is.  And I look good in a tie.  Having worked exclusively in bars for the last couple of years, it's a pleasure that no one here is (visibly) drunk.  Also, all the lights are on and there isn't all that gay music blaring.  The biggest change for me was just getting into the building.  I haven't randomly temped post September 11th, and the procedure for getting into this building (into which I once, literally, waltzed -- have I mentioned I'm gay?) was daunting.  It's an industry.  A new Visitors' Centre has been constructed, with four or five operators at terminals asking questions, getting IDs, contacting the firm, and issuing passes.  Then the security guards, the requisite metal detectors, and another security pass.  I collected stickers like a steamer trunk this morning.  But the thing that struck me was what an industry it is.  All those receptionist/ID checkers and security guards, all the phones and computers and electronic-eye turnstiles.  Weird and necessary and oh-so-expensive.  I trained at an exciting new bar last night, thanks to my  urlLink Delicious Roomie , so I imagine I'll temp-a-little, pour-a-little...which should be a good balance of work schedules and get me back to auditioning.  For now, excuse me...I've gotta take dictation...

       The Runaway Memory  I was a bore in New Orleans.  Really.  When things went horriblyawry, like waiting too long for an order in a restaurant, or some Southern twinkie not getting a  urlLink Chita  reference, I'd start with the "well, in New York..."   urlLink My fellow transplanted Yankee  and I shared many an annoyed moment finishing that very sentence.  Food, service, shopping, street entertainers, conversation, heating: all of it compared unfavorably against New York and I went on and on about it.  But mostly, mostly, you didn't want to go to the movies with me.  I went to see any movie that was shot in Manhattan.  Then I spent the entire time whispering to whatever poor sap sat next to me.  "That's the deli across from my chiropodist."  "Fer crissakes, if you stand at that corner you can't see the Flatiron Building, but if you turn left and go down one block there's a great shop that sells the most amazing goat cheese."  "I used to fool around with a guy who's cousin worked in that building."  I don't know what these movies were about, but it was the closest I could get to being home and I soaked up every second of the City.  After the movie, I'd wander disappointedly through the Quarter, longing for New York.  Tonight, I had the opposite experience.  I went to a movie that was shot entirely in New Orleans while I was in exile.  Not a movie I probably would've seen otherwise, but I was curious.  Yup, there was that shot of Gene Hackman driving down Dauphine.  The fake statue on Royal.  The Napoleon House where we'd go after rehearsals.  10 seconds of Becky Allen.  The courtroom my friend Sid helped dress.  Jackson Square.  New Orleans looked beautiful.  Beignets looked delicious.  The Quarter, exotic.  There's that alley near Lounge Lizard and the Palace Cafe where I applied for a job.  After the movie, I walked out onto 42nd Street, up Eighth Avenue, popped into a Duane Reade, ran into a friend, chatted, bought some bananas at a Korean deli, hopped the A train and came home.

       Home  Last night, I sat in a coffee shop on Eighth Avenue waiting for my friends' show to finish.  I had a very engaging book, but the rain kept drawing my gaze outside.  One window opening to the avenue, the other to 52nd Street.  I remembered that this place used to be a little neighborhood restaurant called King Crab.  It was the place where Pongo and I once splurged on their lobster dinner and the place where I had discovered I liked salad if there was red onion and honey mustard dressing.  A girl had served us who I had been in a group with at the Actors' Fund.  I could see across the street the deli street where I used to drag poor Thurber on our nightly quest for the newest Ben & Jerry flavor, and the Ray's Pizza where I had pizza the one and only night I went out in drag.  I was about 20 and my friend Kevin and I went to Studio 54 as Krystl and Alexis (I was Alexis).  At the corner, an apartment building where I once looked at an apartment.  Top floor with roof access, which I liked because you could gaze down at the stage door of the Uris.  And across 51st from that building, the funny old hotel-turned-condos with all the explorers' names where I once saw Wanda Richert.  Must've been '83 and she was probably doing Nine, replacing Anita Morris.  Though I couldn't see it from the coffee shop, I thought about that next corner, 50th Street and Eighth Avenue.  When I moved here, two of those corners were parking lots and the third hosted the infamous Adonis Theatre, the first blue movie theatre I ever visited and a building that, learning it was to be torn down, made me cry, because it had once been a silent movie theatre and in the hot months I'd heard they'd shown the movies on the roof, the Eighth Avenue El interfering hardly at all.  The idea of that was/is so romantic to me.  Practically every block houses some memory for me, some connection of my life, the life that truly began that day in August I stepped off the bus at Port Authority.  Squares of concrete stand sentinel to moments in time that live only in my weird memory.  I sat with my book and my coffee and suddenly I was crying.  After six months, it hit me that I'm finally home.  My home.  The place in the world I truly belong.  A little later, walking up 45th Street towards Broadway, past my old friends the Golden, the Booth, the Music Box I found myself smiling, then laughing, then just smiling again.  Knowing,  knowing , where home is and being there.  At last.  I could cry and laugh at the same time.

      I despise hypocrisy.  Say what you will about me (and many of you have), if you know me you can be pretty sure you know where you stand with me.  There are times when I may hold back, but sooner or later, for better or worse, it comes out.  I can't help it.  I can't pretend not to be mad at you.  I can't just play some superficial game of niceties when I think you're an idiot.  I suffer fools not at all.  This trait kept me, at times, from being popular in New Orleans, where the intricacies of Southern politesse place enough distance between two people that actual feelings hardly ever matter.  Not that I don't admire  urlLink the language of the fan , but  I'm a brash New Yorker and I generally like to cut through all that.  Maybe, though, I need to reign it in a little.  Maybe I need to learn to hide my contempt.  Maybe I should just shut my stinkin' trap and play the game a little more.  Let's go back to just reigning it in a little.  I don't see anything wrong in being honest.  Even brutally honest, when it's called for.  But I'm beginning to see the value in holding back a little more.  How you say in the English: circumspect?  That being said, last night I eliminated from my life: a major crack whore, a morphine addict, two not-very-gay-even-for-pay heterosexuals, a mood swinger and a whole lotta messy drunks.

       Promise Me  ...that in another 10 years, when I'm 51, if you see me walking down Eighth Avenue in an outfit that looks like it was borrowed from my 14-year-old niece, including cropped, rhinestone t-shirt and those clam digger pants that look good on practically no one, just shoot me.  No questions asked.  I'll provide in my will for some sort of compensation.  Thank you.

       And We're Back...Again...  Well, I've been back in New York for six months.  Amazing.  Glorious.  Nowhere else on Earth I'm supposed to be.  Being in New Orleans gave me, if nothing else, that perspective.  The transition was seamless, including getting a job within an hour of being home, so I've been living my life instead of writing about it.  But last night, after a pretty groovy weekend, I kept getting the message over and over:  are you writing?  So, okay...I'm writing.  At least here.  Saturday night at  urlLink ViewBar  (yeah, I'm a Chelsea bartender/manager...we'll talk about that later, okay?) we had a big benefit that I brought into the bar, hosted and produced by my friend  urlLink Will Clark .  Lots of porn stars I didn't know (I'm not a big porn-watcher...for me it's like rolling the dessert cart by me, but telling me I can't have a slice), like Michael Lucas, Michael Brandon, the very tasty  urlLink Bret Wolfe  (who I might have made out with a little), the Jet Set Boys, and on and on.  There were raffles and signings, the energy was great and friendly, the porn boys brought no attitude whatsoever, my co-bartender, Elroy, who I love working with on a regular night, kicked it into high gear and was a party all on his own.  The whole night was a blast.  Lots of friends came in all night long, Elroy and I made a LOT of money, and the entire night was a success.  Even though I had to fire the barback at the end of the night (or maybe  because ), it was one of my best nights there.  I had breakfast at the Venus, as usual, and got home about 7am, falling into a delicious sleep.  Yesterday I was off.  New for me, because I've usually had days off mid-week.  But starting yesterday, Sunday and Monday.  And since his husband was busy toiling in the  urlLink Mamma Mia  fields, Dr. John and I thought we'd go see the depressing new Olympia Dukakis/Parker Posey movie, "The Event" (which we'd had the after-party for at ViewBar).  It was exactly what we'd wanted...funny, weepy, lots of good Olympia moments.  Not a perfect movie, but still.  After the movie we turned our phones back on and I had three messages, two from JonJordan inviting us to a party at  urlLink Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman's  loft.  So Dr. John and I had a quick dinner at Food Bar and met JonJordan and his adorable husband Joe.  And what a groovy party.  Marc and Scott are such gracious and generous hosts.  For an impromptu party (Genre Magazine is doing an article on them and wanted a typical evening at home with them, hence the party), it surely was catered and staffed.  I didn't get the same bartender twice, and I went back for drinks many, many times.  Many, many.  We schmoozed with the Broadway boys and girls for a bit, but JonJordan and Joe were off to  urlLink Avalon , which Dr. John and I weren't in the mood for, so we departed the loft (reluctantly...I mean, four bedroom, two baths, and a recording studio, for crissakes) and the doctor and I went off to Rambles at the Park.  The Park is a former parking garage transformed into one of the most unique restaurant/club spaces in Manhattan.  On Sunday night  urlLink Jonny McGovern   hosts Rambles at The Park, a very hip, sexy party that flows through three levels of music and boys, with an expansive courtyard and a great rooftop deck featuring a hot tub (and naked boys soaking).  My Tuesday night DJ, Nita Aviance, usually spins the party, but Nita was spinning in the East Village last night.  DJ Jon Jon Battles was there though, showering Dr. John and me with drink tickets and Dannii Minogue cds.  We fought our way to the very crowded bar, which became totally worth it when a new friend of mine, who also happens to be the author of a hit new Broadway play, returned to his roots as a very sexy go-go boy and started shakin' it on the bar in his overalls.  He got lots of our dollar bills.  We rambled through the Rambles for awhile, but it was SO crowded and we were out of drink tickets, so we hopped in a cab and flew across town to The Slide, where my roomie, DJ Aaron Elvis was spinning SuperSized Sundays (referring to the drinks).  Aaron was shocked to see us, but forked over, say it with me:  many drink tickets .  There was a marathon drag show going on, including my friend Paprika Swirl, and the crowd was full of friends and customers.  The coolest thing about managing and tending bar in Chelsea is, as it was in New Orleans, a lot of people know you and so no matter where you go there's someone fun to goof off with.  Anyway, the Good Doctor and I embibed mightily, chatted and flirted (and possibly made out) with various boys, got snaps on our ensembles from Beyonce's stylist, Todd, and laughed our asses off until we realized it was just time to stop drinking and go home.  I dropped John off at 81st Street and took the cab home.  I slept late late today.  Gonna catch up with JonJordan and Joe later.  But as I was walking Dex today down Convent Avenue underneath those old London Plane trees, with the  Autumn sun taking the edge off the cool air, both of us happy to be out together, and me not nearly as hung over as I should be, I realized that I'm not just  happy  to be home.  It's  right  to be home.

       Every Job But Blow...  Monday Morning:  Temp for CEO and Senior Vice President of Big Insurance Firm.  Free coffee, Diet Coke, and one of my best friends is an AVP, so we have mini-gossipfests.  Get call from Temp Agency begging to work for them this afternoon. Monday Afternoon:  Temp for snotty lawyer chick at Big Law Firm.  Good coffee and great views.  Plus fast internet.  Incredibly hot lawyer sits two offices down, but I suspect he might call me "sir" (in that bad, respect for elders kinda way) so I avoid him. Monday Night:  Tend bar for shouldn't-quite-be-open-but-is-anyway queer bar where I may or may not be managing soon.  Get visits from friends and glamorous, but all the free coffee has worn off and Apple Pucker has no restorative powers.  Quiet enough that one can visit with friends, including  urlLink Genius Roommie .  Get home at 4:40 Tuesday Morning:  Temp at different Big Law Firm for hunky, wooly-headed attorney who has no work for me but stares at me every time he passes my desk to go to the men's room every half hour (either he thinks I'm cute and wants me to follow him, or he's doing bumps and he's paranoid, or he's got an eating disorder and wonders if I have TicTacs).  Free coffee and, more importantly, free Diet Coke at this firm.  Very close proximity to an Au Bon Pain. Tuesday Night:  Reasonable walk for Dexter, think about going to gym, then fall fast asleep with the tv on. Wednesday Morning:  Back to Big Law Firm.  City is quiet and train is rabble-free.  Avail myself of Au Bon Pain morning treat and proceed to what I imagine will be a quiet, pre-turkey day.  I mis-imagine.  I'm working for an over-achieving, entirely lesbian real estate department.  Busy,  but the lesbians enjoy my humor and ply me with Diet Coke (which is free anyway).  Midday I learn, via the New York Post, that an  urlLink old friend of mine is marrying Tori Spelling .  Wish I'd thought of it.  Late afternoon get call from bar I've been waiting to work for asking me to fill-in.  I agree to be there at 10pm. Wednesday Night:   Bad news first:  I'm not behind the bar, I'm doing coat check.  Good news:  It's cold.  End up making great money, with my roommate the illustrious  urlLink Aaron Elvis  at the decks and various, flirty hotties roaming the bar.  We take the A train home around 4:30am, about the time Jon Jordan is getting up to make  urlLink Harvey  look pretty for America. Thursday:  Drag my sorry, tired ass out of bed and down to Jon and Joe's to start cooking while Jon is uptown taking care of Harvey who is not, NOT Mrs. Santa Claus, but Edna Turnblad dressed as Mrs. Claus.  He still makes quite the media flap and even ends up on the cover of  urlLink The New York Times .  Since he was nice to Jon today, we applaud him.  Dinner is traditional and, while I'm worked like a scullery maid, I still manage to down a couple of Stoli Raspberry, Apple Pucker & Tonics and not get weepy about being home for Thanksgiving.  As any good faggot knows, " urlLink I'll Cry Tomorrow ."  I pass out on the sofa until I can manage to down a couple more large spoonfuls of corn pudding and head home to dog and bed. Friday Night:  One of my weirdest bartending experiences yet: I subbed at Siberia.  This deserves it's own entry someday.  But I make money and survive. Saturday Night:  I sub again at Dorothy's, the not-quite-ready-to-open-but-open anyway bar where I filled-in on Monday.  Still no running water, still no ice machine, still no heat.  There was no bank, so I called the owners who turned up with a little cash, part of which I had to use (illegally) to buy alcohol, because there wasn't much.  I try to send my barback, who informs me he can't buy liquor because he's only 19.  Cute.  Actually, 19 year olds aren't that cute, they're just 19.  So I go out and buy a couple of bottles of liquor, only to come back and find the barback serving drinks.  This is bad.  The night just keeps spiraling downward, including a fight between two sexually and geographically ambiguous individuals who've wandered over from Port Authority, and a lot of in-bar smoking and cocain abuse (mostly from the owners).  I realize this is not a bar where a Virgo would be happy and I vow not to return.  My week was full and rich, rich and full.  Now where, exactly, did I leave my real life?

      Where the hell does November go?  Remember how I loved temping?  How it seemed fresh and new again?  It's old.  Well, not so much the temping but the getting up at 7am and the crush of people I don't like on the downtown A train and the getting up at 7am.  I like the free coffee and lunch.  And unlimited internet.  So I may or may not have taken another job in a bar.  Not full time.  And not in Chelsea.  It's new, so I'll be in on the ground floor and one day can bitch about how I'd been around since the beginning and things sure have gone to hell since the old days.  But more importantly it means cash.  Beeoootyfoool caaaaaaaash.  Daddy's nearly broke.  Again.  So I'll temp a little, sling the gin for the gays a little.  Balance.  I can audition again.  Take class.  Perhaps become suitable for dating once more (not that anyone's asking, but one likes to be prepared).  I will not, however, be Elaine Stritch's assistant, as was briefly a possibility.  I'm sad as that would have combined my two new loves of temping and slinging gin, but the interview never happened.  Ah, lack-a-day.  I'm gearing up for Thanksgiving at Jon Jordan's.  His new mother-in-law will be joining us from Missouri, and so he's tamed the menu.  I think the most exciting side dish (besides me, naturally), will be some sort of sweet potato casserole with Gruyere.  Eh.  He'll be all wound up already, because he has to go turn Harvey Fierstein into Mrs. Claus for all the world to see in the parade, and Ms. F is not so pleasant any time of the day, but I imagine 4am on Thanksgiving with her turkey dinner much too far in the future, she'll be cranky.  And take it out on Jon Jordan.  But he won't take it out on us, he'll just be wound up.  Which is when I'll crush up a Vicodin into his vanilla vodka and get back to my Gruyere.  Ah, home for the holidays...  (Not that I won't miss gumbo with the  urlLink you   urlLink two , but New Orleans was never a Thanksgiving place to me...I'm sure you'd noticed.  And please don't stuff the Ruffin and medicate the turkey.)  So.  There.  I've blogged a little.  Carry on...

       Rainy Days and Thursdays...  It's gray out.  Must've rained a little earlier, might again.  I love this weather.  I love the light on these days.  The sun barely filtered through bruised clouds.  A little chill.  Gray sky, gray City.  It gives me a feeling of, I don't know how to explain it other than euphoric melancholia.  I think I'll put on my clunky Arthur Miller glasses and take my Vanity Fair to a coffee shop and sit and read and watch the crowds and the sky.

      Don't look so sad,  It's not so bad you know.  It's just another night,  That's all it is, it's not the first,  It's not the worst you know,  We've come through all the rest,  We'll get through this.  We've made mistakes,  But we've made good friends too.  Remember all the nights we spent with them?  And all our plans,  Who says they can't come true?  Tonight's another chance to start again.  It's just another New Year's Eve,  Another night like all the rest.  It's just another New Year's Eve,  Let's make it the best.  It's just another New Year's Eve,  It's just another Auld Lang Syne,  But when we're through this New Year  You'll see, will be  Just fine.  We're not alone, we've got the world you know.  And it won't let us down, just wait and see.  And we'll grow old, but think how wise we'll grow.  There's more you know, it's only New Year's Eve.  It's just another New Year's Eve,  Another night like all the rest.  It's just another New Year's Eve,  Let's make it the best.  It's just another New Year's Eve,  It's just another Auld Lang Syne,  But when we're through this New Year, you'll see, will be  Just fine.

       Wish I Had A River  It's quiet today in TempWorld.  Some of that's probably due to my ears being stopped up.  Cold or something.  Jon Jordan loaded me down with Emergen-C and some dubious little pills with the vague name of Wellness Formula.  I feel better, but only from the comfort of friends.  I don't know what Wellness Formula does.  I stopped, this morning, at a deli near my old apartment.  Pongo and I always called it the New Deli, but I don't remember why (the owners are Greek).  Had a bacon, egg & cheese on a roll and also picked up one of their giant blueberry muffins.  Not even really all that hungry, I just knew it would all taste like another Christmas Eve and that's what I was hungry for.  For a second I thought about just walking back into my old building, taking the elevator up to 13 and knocking on my old door.  Or maybe in my pocket would be the key with the red plastic sleeve that would readmit me.  Christmas doesn't mean very much to me.  Never has.  The very first Christmas tree I remember was silver foil with blue plastic teardrop ornaments.  There was a scratchy white and silver glitter tree skirt and a color wheel.  If my mother were a tree...  But that tree symbolizes everything I've come to associate with "Christmas."  I just can't buy into any of it, and I've tried.  The forced gaiety of the whole season is repellant to me and, while I'm not aggressively angry about as I used to be, I'm just not moved to participate.  The only Christmas tradition I even remotely miss from childhood is Noche Buena.  My family of Spaniards would gather at my Tia Emilia's house for a traditional meal of pernil, moros y christianos, and who remembers what else.  Sometimes one of the adults would walk us over to Braddock Street, where the residents went all out with the lights and decorations.  In those days, my Tia Emilia's house was next to several empty lots, where my cousin Chuck and I would go after dinner and scan the skies for signs of reindeer.  I think we really thought we might see something, too.  But maybe it was just the giddy effect of the December Florida air, cool and bright but not cold.  Inside seemed airless.  There weren't presents to open that night, since our families didn't exchange presents (which I think is odd).  We probably watched tv after dinner while the adults talked.  It was pretty boring, but seemed familial in a way I was probably hungry for, since at home it was just my poor, cold-hearted mother and me.  Here we had a mother and father, siblings, uncles, a grandmother (my great-aunt).  Food that was lovingly prepared and these people actually, almost liked each other.    We'd get together again the following week, Emilia would make churros and fresh hot chocolate from a huge block of semi-sweet chocolate sent by her sister from Spain.  We'd watch Guy Lombardo on her color tv and then go home.  I don't think anyone kissed when the ball dropped.  So a little lingering loneliness is seasonal for me, and not entirely unpleasant.  I don't mind a little sadness -- it's palpable.  But when the ball drops this year, there will be kissing.

       What I Learned From Kiki & Herb   Flesh is everything.  No one wants to fuck The 'Stones anymore...  It's not how  I  feel about  you , it's how  you  make me feel about  myself .  Thank you my Most Adored  urlLink Sparky  and delicious urlLink Glenn  for bathing me in the true spirit of Christmas.  Yes, someone's house always burns down on Christmas and if we're gonna be miserable anyway, why not spread it around?  Who says I can't grasp a message?  Got to meet  urlLink Andy  at loooong last.  Got to see Julian Fleisher happy and all dated up (so goyische!).  It was a successful evening.

       Boozy Old Showgirls  I promised Jon Jordan I would be better about Christmas this year, so I could hardly decline when he invited me to the Hairspray Christmas party at the Supper Club.    The night before I'd gone with my friend Allen to a sort-of work-related (for him) Christmas/birthday party at the home of his  very  English boss.  She's lovely and I enjoy her, but the party was deadly-dull, with only champagne to drink, and Allen (a former chorus boy himself), our friend Mike (with whom I did summer stock many years ago and who now works for this very insurance firm), and I were pressed into leading carols.  That being an obviously vodka-fueled activity was grating to perform on just the pressings of the Widow Cliquot, but I tried to be a good sport.  So I wasn't yet ready for another party.  The Supper Club, though, is a groovy space.  Many years ago, when it was the Edison Theatre, my high school sweetheart who'd moved to New York before me, performed there in Oh! Calcutta.  Another old and dear friend and mentor from the place where I'd grown up, was an usher there, so I used to hang out in the building pretty often.  It's been restored to it's Deco ballroom grandeur and I always enjoy parties there.  I knew enough people, so I sat in a booth on the side of the dancefloor and chatted, ate, drank.  Other than wanting to be with Jon and Joe, I didn't have much interest in being there, but I'm glad I was if for this one moment:  watching my sweet friend dance with the partner-in-life he waited so long to find.  It wasn't a particularly tender song, Ain't No Mountain High Enough, but they were out on that dancefloor holding hands and laughing and singing to each other.  Together.  I couldn't want anything more for Jon.  Yeah, okay, I cried a little...so what?  It's the least jealous I've ever been.  The incomparable dragoon Paprika Swirl (our friend Alex) was hosting an after party/birthday party for our friend Jonny at Dorothy's (the tragic little bar where I subbed during Thanksgiving) and tried to drag me off, but I had to stop off at Arriba! Arriba! and have a birthday cocktail with my friend Brent after his show.  On the way there, realizing I couldn't walk in empty handed, I bought about $20 of Scratch And Win lottery tickets and shoved them in a birthday card.  Kids Love 'Em!  Even 44 year olds.  The drink with Brent and John (and Russ and Michael and Michael's hot boyfriend whose name I can't recall) was low-key and really nice.  Two married couples and Russ and me.  Yeah.  And Russ was just drunk enough to think hitting on me was a good idea.  Yeah.  But I did get an invitation to spend New Year's Eve with Brent and John at their house for a low-key party.  They've promised a rousing game of Celebrity, which will pretty much guarantee my attendance.  Of course, John still thinks I'm getting an invitation to the Shaiman-Wittman's which, while cool, won't be nearly as meaningful as spending that time with good friends.  Brent and John don't buy it.  It's the same reaction I got the year I went to the Tony Awards instead of watching it at their house:  Radio City was cool, but I would've had a better time with them.  I hate to think where this puts me as a social climber, but I'll just have to live with the consequences.  Also, Zev is scheduled to appear on New Year's.  A loooooooong time flirtation.  Jewish.  South African.  Doctor.  Hot.  So, after drinks with the boys, I thought I might just have some drinks with the boys.  I hadn't figured out that  open bar + birthday drinks - substantial food intake = Boozy Charlie Raining like hell, so I hopped in a cab for the ten block trip to Dorothy's where Jon and Joe and everyone were still knockin' 'em back.  Ah, Dorothy's...still no running water, or heat, or ice machine.  There was now a cd player so that Alex and Ginger could do a mini drag show, however the speaker blew and the queens were sniffy about performing to the music of a jukebox (really, what's the diff?), so that party started to fizzle and Jon and Joe and I went off for a Fat Bitch Breakfast at the Renaissance.  This was just like old times.  Jon and I at the diner at 1am.  Now there was Joe...even better.  And my reward for coming out in the rain to parties about which I was apathetic?  Well, Sunday night was also the closing night of the revival of "Nine" and after their party, a couple of the revelers were still hungry and so into the Renaissance twirled....Chita Rivera!  She and Jon have worked together a couple of times, most notably doing "Anything Goes" at Paper Mill.  So she came over to say hello and sat with us for a bit.    Breakfast with Chita.  How lovely is that?

       The New York Times' Effect On Man  I have seen  urlLink my future  staring back at me from The New York Times.  I wish I could jet out and meet Madame Becket, catch a performance, maybe find a way to help subsidize her.  We'd of course become fast friends, taking a soothing tea before her afternoon, pre-performance nap (during which I'd steam out her costumes and bake the pratical cake for Act II).  Eventually I'd take small roles in the musicales, and every night I'd run home, scribbling what I could remember into endless journals (hmmm...might that lead to my breakthrough Broadway performance of "I Am My Own Ghost-Town Diva"...?).  Or perhaps, being bound by my solemn promise to her dying wish, I'd end my days as the  urlLink Julian Eltinge  of Death Valley Junction, tailoring revivals of La Becket's masterpieces to my own talents.  In the article, it does seem like she's calling particularly to me across the country, across the newsprint.  "She has a message for the New York artist:  'While you have time left, find a place where you can live out your dreams," she says. "Even if it is on top of a mountain or in the middle of a desert.'"  Actually, sounds more appealing than my meager offerings at Don't Tell Mama...

       Crystal White Winters That Melt Into Springs  So cold this weekend.  So very cold.  And although my garrett in Harlem is overheated, the  idea  that it was so cold was enough to keep Dexter under the covers with me (which I happen to love, but it's usually really hard to get him to play Cave Family with me...don't ask).  But I did venture out.  Had a very bonding brunch with  urlLink Michael , at the Galaxy in our old neighborhood.  Two refugees from Hell's Kitchen, reminiscing about the old days.  It was actually great seeing Michael, who's my new hero.  If I can ever get him to start blogging again, he'll be yours, too.  I couldn't imagine being a student in a New York City school, much less a teacher.  I don't have the patience to wait in line at Gristede's, and there he is dealing every day with emotionally disturbed adolescents and still making a difference.   urlLink Glenn , too.  Amazing.  And, oddly enough, a topic we chewed over and over (for several reasons)  urlLink turned up in the Times , albeit a little late.  My question is, was this article really assigned or was someone trying to justify a lost weekend?  And how, exactly, do you get reimbursed by the Gray Lady for a fact-finding mission to the West Side Club...I've never gotten a receipt...

       If It's Tourist Season, Why Can't We Shoot Them?  Actually, they seem to be gone.  I can get a seat on the subway.  With one hand holding a leash attached to an active dog and the other holding a baggie of poop, I'm not asked if I could "just take a picture of me and my friend."  I can more easily negotiate around the Sudden Stoppers in the theatre district.   The only good thing I can say about tourists in Manhattan is that at least they're not  urlLink wearing beads ...

      Tomorrow is the memorial service of an old friend.  I'd learned he'd died through a New York Times obit, which is mildly surreal.  We hadn't seen each other a lot in the past few years, mostly because he'd moved to Chicago.  But when he was back in New York doing his Off-Broadway show the same time I was doing mine, we reconnected.  Maybe 15 years ago, I got a call on a Friday afternoon asking if I could leave the following night for LA to join rehearsals for a cruise ship.  Six months, Atlantic crossing, then all Mediterranean ports.  Hell yeah!  I was in my twenties and one could do things easily then.  However, on my way across country, I started to get sick.  Maybe  it was the recycled air on the plane, but by the time I landed I was a mess:  I was all stuffed up, eyes were almost swollen, sore throat, headache.  Stephen, who was the musical director, met me at the gate, looked me over, took me first to a Ralph's for juice and stuff, then straight to the cast house where he fed me soup, vitamins, juice and put me to bed.  He'd never met me before.  Twelve hours later, thanks to him, I was much, much better and in rehearsal.    Stephen and I really connected.  If he hadn't had Larry, it probably would've evolved into something else.  As it was it almost did.  Almost.  We laughed about it.  When Stephen was in Europe, he sent me a leaf from the Isle of La Grande Jatte to press into my first edition of "Sunday In The Park With George."  A couple of years later, when he was conducting the Radio City Christmas Show, we spent Christmas drinking champagne in one of the star dressing rooms at Radio City (Santa had the other) and, after his show, we delivered Christmas meals for God's Love We Deliver.  A couple of years after that, I ran into he and Larry on the street and, so happy to see him, was completely oblivious to the fact that he was with Dolores Gray.  She was lovely and seeing how glad we were to see each other, invited me along to dinner.  It was off an on like that until the end.  Before I moved to New Orleans, I ran into Stephen at the dog run.  He was looking frail.  I was feeling ragged.  He was off to Provincetown to open "Naked Boys."  I was off to the Dirty South for who knows what reason.  We hugged and wished each other luck.  I don't wanna go to his memorial service.  I know what it'll be like:  I'll laugh, I'll cry, I'll flirt with chorus boys.  Maybe the sheer number of them over the years has anesthetized me (memorial services, not chorus boys).  Maybe I'm just old and bitter.  But I just don't wanna go.

       A Chair Is Not A House  The thing about apartment hunting in Manhattan is that in the 15 years since I actually had to, nothing's really changed.  Well, maybe higher rent, but not that much.  When Pongo and I moved into that dream apartment on 54th Street in 1989, I thought I'd never leave.  1,100 square feet, pre-war, foyer, dishwasher, tons of closet space, service entrance.  It was huge and everyone who visited was jealous.  Down the hall lived one of the original promoters of Woodstock, Cy Coleman's offices were there for awhile, Michael Stewart used to live next door, George White used to live in the penthouse where  the guy who was in Phantom lives now.  Very theatrical building.  Weird corner, but good building.  But it came time to leave.  Now?  I dunno.  I love Hell's Kitchen, but  maybe I wanna live in the East Village.  Nolita?  Dumbo?  NoTifSoSher (that one's for  urlLink you , darling).  Yeah, I want some space, but I don't need all that much space anymore.  Maybe near a dog park?  Just not Harlem anymore.  It's not a livable neighborhood yet.  At least not for me.  Groceries are far,  no diners or coffee shops, transactions after a certain time take place through bullet proof plexiglass, people are afraid of my dog and there aren't any runs, it can be sketchy and dirty, and it's far for costume changes.  Also, we have a roommate who doesn't understand boundaries.  No, not  urlLink that one .  Milk and peanut butter and mouthwash and toothpaste disappear and sex happens in the bathroom for a long time.  So, the hunt is on.  Wanna live with the Blogstalker?  Email me, baby.

       Dex And The City  I woke up around 1pm, strangely not hungover.  The day was mild.  I wrote a little while the dog slept curled up next to me.  I looked over at him, he breathed at me.  I love that dog.  So I figured we'd start the year with a long, lovely walk, maybe even find parts of the Park we'd never seen before.  At 109th Street we found another, smaller ice skating rink neither of us knew about and just beyond it found some new woodlands we'd never explored.  Dex chased some squirrels (I think he'd be startled if he actually caught one) and it was quiet and gorgeous.  Then at 100th Street we decided to cross over to Riverside Park and go to that dog run he likes so well.  He had a ball.  And a stick.  Then through Riverside Park up to 116th Street where a woman paid us an amazing compliment:  "You and your dog look alike."  I was flattered.  And then up through the Columbia campus and back home to order Chinese food.  Quiet day.  Low key.  A guy and his dog and their City.  I dunno, maybe it'll be a good year...

       View From A Blog  Drinking on a Thursday night.  Next it'll be in the middle afternoon, like I'm a Kennedy or something.  Still, when issued an invitation by the likes of  urlLink him , there's naught to do but accept and revel.  There was a time I'd be out almost every night.  I could tell you the day of the week only by the party I'd been to the night before.   It must be Thursday, because Gant Johnson was spinning at Flamingo East last night, meaning it was Salon Wednesday.   Seemed glamorous enough to me.  It was cute chatting with boys and sipping cocktails with nothing to get up for but an Off-Broadway show I could easily get through with a hangover (and worse.  And did.).  But since I started working in bars, they've lost a bit of their luster.  More often than not, it's a busman's holiday.  If you have to deal with the disturbingly drunk, it's best to have  a couple of feet of wood between you.  And I'm not talking the good kinda wood.  So now I mostly go out for a specific reason and, often, with a specific deadline.  Or, as happened with my  urlLink new roommie  and his pals a couple of weeks ago, in the sea of boys I suddenly feel like I'm drowning and just leave.  Okay, maybe not as dramatic as all that, but I wasn't, as the kids say, "feelin' it."  Add to all this that the gathering was at the bar I quit in October, the one in which I have not set Sketchered foot, and I gave myself, ooooh, half an hour.  First, let me publicly state with no hesitation nor any sense of irony: I worship  urlLink Bob .  I feel like we're already speaking shorthand and we've really just met.  At one point, during a stalkery moment (and, let me hasten to point out, I was not the stalker in question), I felt like I could turn to him and speak in the sign-language my friends and I developed on the dancefloor of the Palladium, so many neon moons ago, and he'd completely get it .  (The gesture I'd had in mind, by the way, was the one where you hold both your hands, palms inward, up to your face, and, with fingers wiggling, alternate them up and down past your head.  The meaning, to be delivered to a cracked-out friend who's head was lolling on the shoulder of an undesirable dance partner: He's gonna take you home and boil your head in a pot.)  So, yes, Bob.   urlLink Aaron  was hosting and Destiny was spinning and  urlLink Gregory  was dancing and  urlLink Jackson  was Jacksoning.  Adorable, smart  urlLink MAK .  The nice real estate boy, recently moved from LA who may or may not have invited me out to dinner with his friend who's moving to Australia.  Other nice people who's names are forever gone, thanks to the  urlLink Wite-Out  effect  urlLink Stolichnaya  has on my post-40 brain.  I do, however, remember  urlLink Patrick's  name.  Sure he's cute, too (but they all have boyfriends, I mean, seriously, it's depressing), but the boy knows how to drink.  Or, as they say in New Orleans,  draink .  He looks all "good boy" and all.  Referred once or twice to a halo I don't think even he can really believe in.  Wearing grown up shoes.  Button down.  Uh-huh, don't let him fool ya.  I'm ready for a rematch, though.  Next time, I'm gonna introduce him to the New Orleans Mind Eraser and see if he can keep up.  With a headstart like that, I fear for the rest of my weekend...

       Phat Tuesday  I can't believe I'm gonna admit this, but today, just a little, I miss being  urlLink there .  To be there when the Society of St. Ann  urlLink marches in front of the house , and  urlLink we  all join in,  urlLink down Royal Street , through the Quarter, and meet  urlLink Rex  at the other end.  It's one of my best memories of New Orleans.  By this time my first Mardi Gras, I had been behind the bar for about three hours, in leather pants, a sleeveless, sequined Jesus shirt and bunny ears (left behind by the Playboy bunnies who'd taken over  urlLink Club 735  the previous night).  Post-middle-aged women from small towns were pointlessly showing me their breasts in hopes of a free drink.  I had control over bags of beads which I was doling out only for good tippers.  And since the bar led out to one of the best balconies on Bourbon Street, and these folks had serious Bead Fever, I was making decent cash.  Of course, most of the boys were straight so there was very little dick shown and I was seeing someone, so no random make-out sessions.  Actually, no randiness at all.  I'd had to be at work around 7am, so there was no Lundi Gras partying or early morning parading for me.  I ended up working until about 8pm, slinging drinks non-stop, and so all I wanted to do was drag my bunny-eared ass home after work.  735 is located at 735 Bourbon Street, right near the corner of St. Ann (where the Fruit Loop begins), and the street was jammed with revelers.  I think it took me about half an hour to get from the door of the club to the corner of St. Ann, where I managed to take a short-cut, grab my bike, and get the hell home and to my dog and my bed.  I didn't quite get the feel for Carnival.  But last year I had just given notice at  urlLink the bar I was managing , and I had already plotted my return to Manhattan, so I was feeling ready for a party.    My friend Becky Allen, with whom I'd just finished performing in "Dirty Blonde," was to be the Queen of Satyricon, a new,  urlLink gay Mardi Gras krewe , in which  urlLink Richard  and  urlLink Jonno  were also involved, so I got to go to a ball.  Very...odd-but-fun.  Lots of parading around in large, elaborate costumes.  Some numbers.   urlLink Varla .  It really deserves its own entry.  We even had a  urlLink Celebrity Houseguest .  Lots of drinking and glitter.  I got to go to a couple of parades on St. Charles.  I'd gone to one by myself the previous year (learning what a bead whore I truly am), and one with the boy I was dating which may or may not have been fun, most of those outings usually erupting with drama and, thus, having been blocked from or reorganized in my memory.  But this year I went with friends, or, more felicitously, ran into friends along the route.  Ahh, to sit on the Neutral Ground with Moonpie and his 17-year-old boyfriend, Paulo (who looked a little like Hillary Duff), drinking big-ass frozen daquiris and collecting beads, beads, BEADS!!  I even went on a date to a parade, with a delightful voodoo priest, who turned out to be weird (imagine).  But he had a hot jeep and we drank raspberry vodka from my silver flask, got tons of beads, ate gator on a stick, then he took me home to meet his "spirits" and that's when it started to go down hill.  Again, probably worthy of its own entry.  But really, the very best by far, was Mardi Gras morning.  I'd planned to skip it, since I'd worked until 4am the night before and had partied during and after the shift and needed to be back in that evening.  Tired, I was.  But as the gang started to gather below, Dex woke me up and when I took him outside, I got caught up.  Caught up, I tell you!  I made a split-second decision to run upstairs and change so I could march.  EVERYONE was in costume.  Simply everyone.  What did I have?  To start with, there was that antique silver beaded Mardi Gras mask Becky Allen had given me.  And the cape.  A silver cape she said I could wear...well, damn her, she said "you'll wear it for Society of St. Ann."  She's astounding.  You have to meet her.  Worthy of her own entry.  Anyway.  I found the silver mirrored gown I hadn't managed to wear for turnabout at Lafitte's and the Bonnie Raitt-esque wig I'd also not worn.  I did forego the silver pumps (size 13 or something ridiculous), knowing that a walk through the Quarter in those would equal a broken ankle.  Besides, my combat boots looked so much more appropriate with the gown.  So: a costume, a drink, a bump and off we went.  Miraculous.  So many people out and frolicking.  No one knew who I was unless I gave them a peek under the mask.  There was Blake in something silky and green, Wes, the oh-so-hot med student with whom I'd dallied briefly,  urlLink barely dressed as a bunny  with a big carrot sticking out of his furry bunny codpiece.  Friends and customers on balconies throwing beautiful beads, Becky joining us in the Quarter in her Satyricon finery.  Hilarious, gorgeous, dazzling.  This is what Mardi Gras really was about.  I got it.  I loved it.  By the time we got to Canal Street, we could see Rex coming the other way.  Like magic.  I said goodbye to the group and stayed to watch a bit of the Rex parade.  Regal, with huge, ornate floats, but not of the same spirit as St. Ann.  That's always gonna be Mardi Gras to me.  I wandered back down Royal to the Marigny, still in my gown and wig and mask and boots.  Stopped to pose for some pictures, stopped for some food.  Handed out some beads to friends who didn't know who I was since I didn't raise my veil.  Then home to change for work and the other side of Mardi Gras: drunks and cash.  It was okay, though.  I got it.  Happy Mardi Gras, y'all!

       Chain, Chain, Chain  When I was a semi-Circuit boy, I was all about the accessories.  Gum, sunglasses, dancefloor toys, etc.  But the most valuable dancefloor accessory I ever bought was the wallet with chain.  Sure it was kicky, edgy at the time, but also I didn't have to worry about my wallet.  No matter how high I got or how lost in the dancing/grinding, my wallet wasn't going anywhere.  I used to break it out only for nights at Twilopalladiumroxylimelight, using my  urlLink LV  wallet the rest of the time.  Sure it meant a little changeover of cash and ID, but Virgos love that.  When I moved to New Orleans, my Louis wallet had long since died (buried, I'm almost embarrassed to say, in a little ceremony somewhere in Central Park), so I switched over to the wallet and chain full time.  Seemed to NOLA thang to do.  It served a similar purpose, New Orleans being one big, messy dancefloor, and as manager of a leather bar it fit (although it was confusing to the boys that I'm a top but liked my wallet chain on my right side).  Back in New York, I was just used to the damn chain.  Goes with almost everything.  Probably time to upgrade the chain, even the wallet, or get a couple of options.  But still, part of my new personal style.  In CorporateWorld today, the HR Wench made a little side comment about my chain.  "Not corporate."  No indeed, not meant to be.  "Probably have to rethink it."  No ma'am, don't intend to.  But I'm gonna wait.  Wait until tomorrow.  Tomorrow's casual day.  Casual day before a holiday.  She always wears the same thing:  black pleather pants, a cheap black knit top with some machine-embroidered flowers around the bodice, and (here it is, kids) brown earth shoes.  Maybe I'll wear two chains tomorrow, just to speed the plow...

       Blogged Down  I guess I'll go to  urlLink Worst. Sex. Ever.  tonight, if only to try and head-off potentially damaging stories about me by a  urlLink Noted Freshmouth .  Also, I'm dying to see  urlLink This One  perform.  And maybe, just maybe, my beloved  urlLink Sparkles  will be there.  I do love me some  urlLink Sparkles ...  It's odd, before I moved to New Orleans, I loved my blog.  I knew all the cool bloggers.  I practically was a cool blogger.  And now, at the risk of sounding old (yet never looking it), I barely know any of these kids.  And a lot of the bloggers from by blogiverse have wandered off out of boredom or, in one noted case, pain.  But the blogging thing has been amazing for me.  I've befriended, dated, had sex with, and even rented from bloggers I met through my site.  It's been terribly therapeutic.  And I wanna keep doing it.  But I'm itching for maybe my own domain (which I don't know how to find) which I'd have to design (beyond me).  On top of that, I'd have to write more consistently.  Do I still have anything to say?  Did I ever (beat you to it)?  Perhaps after the move to Brooklyn.  Change of venue, upgrade of computer and roommates.  Until then, let us see what I spew out here.  Do you mind terribly?

       Yeah, Whatever...  Jesus, I keep disappearing.  Even I'm annoyed by me.  So I'm moving.  To Williamsburgh.  Which is apparently hip, but not Colonial Williamsburgh.  Which is sad, 'cause I look hot in a powdered wig.  But it'll be groovy and damned reasonable and I'll have swell roommates who won't eat my food.  Yesterday I went to Sleepy Hollow.  Friends are getting their six-week-old foster baby this week, so we went to pick up a crib that was being given to them.  Sleepy Hollow was cute.  And sleepy.  The couple who were giving the crib were also cute, with two babies, Sophie and Phoebe.  Cute names.  We ate lunch at the very cute Headless Horseman Restaurant.  Got back to their apartment and assembled the crib in the rainslicker yellow nursery.  Cute, cute, cute.  Everything's cute and happy and yellow.  I need to be violated in the worst way.

       Erik  My friend Erik is the biggest hippy I know.    We met in New Orleans.  The first bar we worked in,  urlLink Lafitte's , he was fired for wearing a pussy.  Actually, he was fired for not taking off the little fur patch g-string thingy he liked to wear during Trash Disco that made all the patrons laugh.  The second bar we worked in was  urlLink The Country Club , a clothing-optional pool bar.  I'm just not a naked person, but Erik absolutely is.  He's not overly buff or hung (as he'll be the first to admit), but he enjoys being free and out there.  Me?  I'm not a naked person.  And though during those days I had many a conversation with him while my hand was held up, palm out, obscuring his naughty bits, I admire him for his freedom.  And Erik is free.  He had as rough a childhood as any kid can have.  Emancipated himself from his parents at 16.  Survived plenty (exactly what is  his  story, and one that I'm urging him to finish writing).  He's lived and travelled all over the world, talking and listening to people from every caste.  Really listening.  And befriending.  I don't have a lot of patience with people and I admit to a certain amount of xenophobia.  I envy Erik's ability to make (and keep) friends everywhere he goes.  Recently I attended a dinner in honor of his 36th birthday, and 8 out of the 10 guests had known Erik since high school.  High School!  While he's been in New York, we've spent a lot of time walking around the City, talking.  He's never seen me here, only knew me in New Orleans.  He says here I'm "in context."  That's nice to hear, but nicer to feel.  We talk about people we know and the crazy, messy, uniqueness of New Orleans.  We talk a little about the boy I dated, of whom Erik never approved (I should've listened the first two times...alas...), and about the possible soulmate Erik thinks got away down there.  Erik just returned from a few months travelling around South America.  He didn't know quite where he was going all the time, but went anyway.  He always does.  He's a Radical Faerie.  He should be tortured but he's not.  He's not judgmental.  He embraces and accepts.  I took him briefly to Ground Zero and he listened to my ongoing pain about that day, those weeks, the hole in my heart and in my City.  I used to get exasperated with some of these qualities.  Especially in New Orleans, surrounded by eccentrics or wanna-be-eccentrics, when all I wanted was to go home.  I loved Erik then, but wished he'd get more grounded, get a steady job, get a place to live.  Now that I'm home and I'm, well, not grounded, but maybe more steadied, I see and appreciate who he is.  I admire him.  I love him more.

       Three Things I Learned At The Black Party  1.  The Black Party is fun, but it's exactly the same fun as the last time you went.  Even the cast is practically the same.  2.  I'm not 21.  I'm not 31.  I'm 41.  Even though I don't feel it, adjustments must be made.  3.  Couples are more fun than I remember.

       Loft-y Visions  An interesting thing has happened in my new space:  I'm dreaming again.  On a regular basis.  Vivid dreams.  And  urlLink Glenn  even reports that I've been talking in my sleep (he's wrong, however, about the snoring).  I remember a terrifying dream the other night of being chased by murderers down long halls and alleyways, one leading into another.  I remember a dream reunion with my friend Jeffrey, who's hair color had changed and he seemed older.  Jeffrey's not dead, just living in LA.  Or so I he said.  I guess I need to start writing them down, because there's more every night.  Perhaps there are answers to the questions of my life hidden in these morpheatic symbols.  But at the very least, they'll be entertaining to me.  I don't know why I've started dreaming so heavily again.  Maybe being in more permanent space has relaxed me.  Maybe it's because my tomb has no windows and so hideous sunlight can't encroach on my REM.  Maybe I's haunted.  Who can say, really?  But I'm glad.  I wonder what it would be like to record my sleep-talking?  What the hell am I giving away in these sessions?  How exactly would I even do it?  It's worth a try, though, if only to prove I don't snore.  'Cause I don't.

       Divine Intervention  As if we didn't love  urlLink her  before...  Dear President Bush,   Today you called upon Congress to move quickly to amend the US Constitution, and set in Federal stone a legal definition of marriage. I would like to know why.   In your speech, you stated that this Amendment would serve to protect marriage in America, which I must confess confuses me. Like you, I believe in the importance of marriage and I feel that we as a society take the institution far too lightly. In my circle of family, friends and acquaintances, the vast majority have married and divorced -- some more than once. Still, I believe in marriage. I believe that there is something fundamental about finding another person on this planet with whom you want to build a life and family, and make a positive contribution to society. I believe that we need more positive role models for successful marriage in this country -- something to counteract the images we get bombarded with in popular culture. When we are assaulted with images of celebrities of varying genres, be it actors, sports figures, socialites, or even politicians who shrug marriage on and off like the latest fashion, it is vitally important to the face of our nation, for our children and our future, that we have a balance of commitment and fidelity with which to stave off the negativity. I search for these examples to show my own daughter, so that she can see that marriage is more than a disposable whim, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.   As a father, I'm sure you have faced these same concerns and difficulties in raising your own daughters. Therefore I can also imagine that you must understand how thrilled I have been over the past few weeks to come home and turn on the news with my family. To finally have concrete examples of true commitment, honest love, and steadfast fidelity was such a relief and a joy. Instead of speaking in the hypothetical, I was finally able to point to these men and women, standing together for hours in the pouring rain, and tell my child that this is what its all about. Forget Britney. Forget Kobe. Forget Strom. Forget about all the people that we know who have taken so frivolously the pure and simple beauty of love and tarnished it so consistently. Look instead at the joy in the beautiful faces of Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon - 51 years together! I mean, honestly Mr. President - how many couples do you know who are together for 51 years? I'm sure you agree that this love story provides a wonderful opportunity to teach our children about the true meaning and value of marriage. On the steps of San Francisco City Hall, rose petals and champagne, suits and veils, horns honking and elation in the streets; a celebration of love the likes of which this society has never seen.   This morning, however, my joy turned to sadness, my relief transformed into outrage, and my peace became anger. This morning, I watched you stand before this nation and belittle these women, the thousands who stood with them, and the countless millions who wish to follow them. How could you do that, Mr. President? How could you take something so beautiful -- a clear and defining example of the true nature of commitment -- and declare it to be anything less? What is it that validates your marriage which somehow doesn't apply to Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon? By what power, what authority are you so divinely imbued that you can stand before me and this nation and hold their love to a higher standard?  Don't speak to me about homosexuality, Mr. President. Don't tell me that the difference lies in the bedroom. I would never presume to ask you or your wife how it is you choose to physically express your love for one another, and I defy you to stand before Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon and ask them to do the same. It is none of my business, as it is none of yours, and it has nothing to do with the "sanctity of marriage." I'm sure you would agree that marriage is far more than sexual expression, and its high time we all started focusing on all the other aspects of a relationship which hold it together over the course of a lifetime. Therefore, with the mechanics of sex set aside, I ask you again -- what makes a marriage? I firmly believe that whatever definition you derive, there are thousands upon thousands of shining examples for you to embrace.   You want to protect marriage. I admire and support that, Mr. President. Together, as a nation, let us find and celebrate examples of what a marriage should be. Together, let us take couples who embody the principles of commitment, fidelity, sacrifice and love, and hold them up before our children as role models for their own futures. Together, let us reinforce the concept that love is about far more than sex, despite what popular culture would like them to believe.   Please, for the sake of our children, for the sake of our society, for the sake of our future, do not take us down this road. Under the guise of protection, do not support divisiveness. Under the guise of unity, do not endorse discrimination. Under the guise of sanctity, do not devalue commitment. Under the guise of democracy, do not encourage this amendment.

       A Fag Grows In Brooklyn  It's official:  I'm Miranda.  Except that I don't have an adorable husband.  Or a baby.  And I'm not a high-powered attorney.  Okay, I guess I just moved to Brooklyn.  Still...  Moving day was not without its inconvenience.  The mover, who was to arrive in Harlem at 8:30AM, called at 7:45AM to announce he'd be a little late.  Three and a half hours late.  But instead of bitching (too much), I napped.  Finally arriving at the loft around 2pm, I found that the roommate I'm replacing wasn't  quiiiiiiiite  ready to move.  But I was patient, and for some very odd reason, not even particularly frustrated.  Around 11PM I was finally able to set up my bed and get to sleep.  The Swanktuary is just as swell as it ever was (well, minus the Sparkly presence of  urlLink You-Know-Whom ).  There are even the infamous, vintage lunchboxes in the bathroom (I get The Hulk!).   urlLink Glenn  and  urlLink Mike  are terrific and accommodating (although no one's brought me coffee in bed quite yet...maybe their waiting for the weekend) and I think this'll be a great arrangement.  Even Dexter has a new pal.  It took Bear about a day to decide if she thought Dex was okay (it's not often either of us run into someone that refreshingly discriminating) and now that have little bursts of playtime.  It's cute and just a little loud.  But, on the whole, quieter than dislike probably would be...  Now I get to decorate my corner of the loft.  I think I'm finally gonna put into action my design concept "Morrocan Whorehouse."  I've even found a swirly bit of carpet which I can use as a color pallette.  I'm going rummaging this weekend in search of a big desk and maybe a stop at  urlLink Pearl River Mart   (though not really Morroccan, one can find odd bits of fluff and hoof with which to be creative).  Maybe now I can breathe a little...

       One Degree of Separation  I've been following the story of  urlLink this fake, murdering doctor .  Sure, partly because he's kinda hot, but there was something oddly familiar about him.  Turns out,  urlLink he skipped bail to Costa Rica on the insurance money from a deceased boyfriend .  I dated the boyfriend.  While Jason had had some health issues even before I'd met him, we were pretty sure those were all behind him and when I last saw him, before I moved to New Orleans, he was happy and well, swinging "The Full Monty" on Broadway.  I dropped off an old costume for him I'd bought at an auction years before, which I knew he'd coveted.  While I was away, he died from something unrelated to his previous illness, but no one can exactly explain what it was.  Now I wonder...  There really are only three fags in New York, the rest is done with mirrors and, apparently, insurance money.  Yikes!

      My first week at the new job has been hectic.  Really long shifts and a lot of wines and house drinks to learn (who drinks tequila, peach nectar and green tabasco?).  I might like it but the money's gotta get better fast.  Sunday night was unbelievably busy, as I'd predicted.  Since our restaurant is right on the Hudson near the Battery, we were in a prime location to view the sailing of the Queen Mary II and the Queen Elizabeth II on their maiden and final New York crossings, respectively.  I'd mentioned a few times that I thought we'd be slammed, but no one seemed particularly interested.  Oh, the pain of always being right...  No barback, only two bartenders (and I was supposed to leave at 8pm...finally got out of there at 1am) and lots of thirsty, firework watchers.  Oy.  But the ships!  I remember, oh, probably 18 years ago, the first time I ever saw the QEII sail.  I was living on West 47th Street, just a couple of blocks from where she was docked.  My roommate and I heard her ship's whistle blast and we went down to watch.  We met up with friends from the neighborhood, there were streamers tossed from deck to pier.  It was thrilling.  I'd only been in New York a couple of years and this just seemed like a glamorous New York moment, the kind I'd dreamt of as a kid.  Watching that sailing made me ache to sail on a luxury liner one day, watching Manhattan slip away with days of sky and sea and white dinner jackets stretching ahead.  I've gotten to do that since.  Several times, actually.  I love huge ocean liners.  The life onboard, the service, the traditions.  For instance, one never dresses for dinner on the first night out because, traditionally, your valet is still unpacking your formal clothing and there wouldn't be time to prepare them properly in time for dinner.  I own an old steamer trunk that rotates on one end with drawers on one side and space to hang clothing on the other.  I love that travelling like that was once the only way to travel and that there was a sense of style and manners and graciousness that's long gone.  Sometimes you can recapture that at sea.  As busy as I was on Sunday, I stopped to watch the Queen Mary 11.  Enormous, probably twice as large as the Titanic, which was mentioned several times.  Beautiful in the twilight, her deck lights gleaming.  Then a little while later the Queen Elizabeth II.  I was struck with an unexpected nostalgia.  Watching her sail out, her last visit to New York, made me think back to that first time I'd seen her.  I was a different person then.  So young.  Still believing that my life would be something grand -- that I'd make a mark, a difference.  A time when I was falling in love with New York and there was so much to discover.  So much flooded back to me in those few moments.  I snapped back into reality very quickly.  3 mojitos, 2 frozen mango margaritas, a bottle of sauvignon blanc...  But it left me with a foggy feeling inside.  Something haunting me a little bit -- not entirely unpleasant, but I'm not sure what it means.  Something left behind by that ship that passed me in the night.

      As this is my last day at Corporate MegaTemp World, Inc., I figured I'd finish up my entry of all my jobs.  But then I was really late ('cause I closed the bar last night -- working, not drinking), and then a few of the gals took me to lunch (mmmm, South Beach-approved jumbo shrimp stuffed with lump crabmeat), and, of course, being the court jester, I had to do a farewell tour, including a lap of each floor.  Oh, and wrap up a little paperwork.  So, I started to blog in my head.  It got all muddled after that.  I kept remembering jobs I'd had, but not when I'd had them.  Yeah, I delivered a little local newspaper for awhile, The Neighbor, and I had that three-speed orange bike, but how old was I?  And what about the singing telegrams I used to deliver?  For two separate companies!  I used to break in on birthday dinners with one of those cymbal-clapping monkeys hanging around my neck.  Oh, I was proud.  And Farrell's, when was that?  I had to memorize an enormous list of ice creams for ungrateful mall rats.  Wasn't that after I was the organ grinder in front of the Columbia Restaurant?  [Y'know what, insert your own jokes about that one, Daddy's tired.]  I've managed a presentations/word processing center for a huge investment bank, I've been the assistant to the assistant of the president of The College Board (even though I never took the SAT), I prepared salads in enormous plastic conch shells for a hot Greek guy in his restaurant, I was a briefly an official escort for the Prince and Princess of Yugoslavia, I was a personal assistant to a nutcase named Ana Tampana (who did a sortof Carmen Miranda knock-off and achieved her 15 minutes from an appearance on "Real People" or "That's Incredible!" or one of those shows), and also a personal assistant to a loud, talented, slightly crazy, fairly famous diva.  One ill-advised night of male prostitution.  The hits won't stop coming, and my Virgo brain can't organize all of these things.  Plus, the process is unearthing memories that are beginning to frighten me.  So not that you care, but I'm leaving you hanging on the rest of that little meme.  Sorry.  Sortof.  Now I understand that there's a strawberry Napoleon somewhere on the 40th floor for the bridal shower of a secretary I don't know, so I'm gonna go snag a piece before I walk out of these doors forever.

      Since about October, I'm been temping at InsuraMegaCorp, Inc. down on Wall Street.  I go for my lunchtime walks (or sneak out for air if I'm bored or annoyed).  Because we're only a block away from the site of the World Trade Center, I walk by there a lot.  It's never a non-issue.  I'm not saying I weep and rend my clothing every time, but it's not like passing a Duane Reade, either.  Now, I guess it's because it's the first nice day this season I've walked by there at lunch, but I noticed a gruesome thing today.  It's GroundZeroLand.  Yeah, the vendors are gone, but so has the somber air.    I remember being down here a couple of days after the attack, when the air was still smoky and everything was covered in ash.  I had to take a timesheet to a temp agency I'd been working for who's offices were on William Street.  Because of street closings, barricades formed a Byzantine path through the district, but coming down Nassau Street I suddenly saw what I didn't want to see.  I flinched.  The last piece of wall was still standing at the end of the end of Maiden Lane.  The air was pink, probably from the ash and smoke and artificial light.  I froze and I was more than a little afraid.  And then people around me, tourists, started snapping pictures.  Gruesome.  I wanted to strike out at them, but all I did was stare.  And then stumble away.  I know it's become a tourist site.  I know we have to move forward.  But how can they stand there, posing their smiling children in front of the chain link fence, while they snap photographs?  How is that acceptable?  That place is a wound, flesh dug out of the skin of New York City.  Now it's trying to scar over, but it's still sore -- at least to me.  Would you run up to a veteran who'd had a limb blown off and ask him to expose it while the gang gathers around it smiling and flashing peace signs?  It's the same to me.  This spot, whatever it becomes, will never be just real estate to me.  September 11, 2001 wasn't the defining moment of our lives, but perhaps the  redefining  moment.  I hate the commercialization of it, the marketing of it.  But I deplore and denounce the consumption of that ground as just another tick off the list of tourist spots without any thought to or honoring of what it meant, means, to those of us who lived and worked in and among the people and structures and peace of mind that was lost there.  Go take your grinning wives and disrespectful children to the Statue of Liberty -- you can get a nice shot from the river just two blocks from where you're standing.  But if you have nothing to bring to this place, don't take anything either.  Sorry, I was horrified by group after group cavorting around as if they were in front of Cinderella's castle.  It's too soon, at least for me, for that kind of casual attitude.  On a positive note, I'm the newest bartender at New York's largest, riverside Southwestern outdoor cafe.  Y'all c'mon by for a Margarita!

      Since I'm in the process of getting a new bartending job, holding offers at bay while I'm waiting for a better one (including an English pub-themed place that's gonna totally be T.G.I.Limey's), and inspired by  urlLink MAK , here are as many of my jobs as I can remember:   Busboy, Red Lobster, Tampa, FL  I don't remember working here very long.  A waitress thought I'd stolen her tip and they fired me.  I smelled of butter a lot.   Busboy/Dishwasher, Country Kitchen, Tampa, FL  This job was good because I got free soda and, at the end of my shift, I got breakfast.  However, it was circa 1979 and I had to wear a big, brown, velvet bowtie with my short-sleeved shirt, and it was a little embarrassing with friends from high school stopped by for pie after roller disco.   Spencer Gifts, Westshore Plaza Mall, Tampa, FL  At 16, it felt kinda dirty.  And when we got hungry, we'd eat the X-rated fortune cookies and edible underwear...they're chewy.   Puppeteer, City of Tampa Recreation Department  I loved this job!  We'd travel to schools, libraries, and community centers, set up our stage, and perform this pretty extensive puppet shows for kids.  The woman I worked for, Virginia Rivers, was a kooky, gypsy-looking, free-spirited woman whom I worshipped and who taught me a lot about finding my artistic center and being whoever I really was (and I need to remember some of those lessons).  This job led to...   Puppeteer/Performer, Virginia's Place, WFLA/TV, Tampa, FL  Yup, local kiddie TV show.  I was, among other things, Chester, the green-faced, orange-haired mischievous puppet.  Chester was kinda like the love child of Ernie from Sesame Street and H.R. Pufnstuf.  I similarly loved this job.  And sometimes we'd tape late enough that we had to suspend shooting while they did the evening news and I could stare longingly at the anchorman, who once borrowed my hairspray.   German Dance, Busch Gardens, Tampa, FL  I used to drive through the employee gates to Busch Gardens like I was driving through the front gates of MGM.  So, so very glam to don my lederhosen and dance a  urlLink shuhplottler  with disgusting tourists from the Midwest.   Showboat, Country Dinner Playhouse, St. Petersburgh, FL  This was my official, first, professional paying gig.  Equity card and all.  The dinner theatre was in a mall.  I played "Pete" and was in the chorus.  I did this while still performing at Busch Gardens, so I didn't have a single day off for almost three months.  But I was 17 or 18, so it was okay.  I did a few more dinner theatre gigs (which, for the moment, I'll spare you from), then in 1983 moved to New York, where I started as...   Sales/Window Display, Antique Boutique, New York City  It was 112 degrees and I was pushing wool overcoats from 1948.  I sold vintage cowboy shirts to Darryl Hall and  urlLink Joe Jackson .  I pretended to know how to do window displays.  I was allergic to the old, moldy clothes.   Cocktail Waiter/Bottle Sorter, Uncle Charlie's West, New York City  I was that chicken with the tray full of cocktails.  I was cute, but nervous.   Puppeteer, Niccolo Puppets, New York City  Someone decided I'd come to no good working in a bar and got me a job touring with a marionnette show of "The Wizard of Oz."  It was me, a guy named Harry Rainbow (seriously), in a van driving to schools, setting up the stage, and working all the marionettes.  Think about the scene where they all meet the Wizard.  Count the people in the scene.  Count the number of hands Harry Rainbow and I had.  Yeah.  My work was less subtle when I had to hold puppets in my teeth.   Switchboard Operator, Answering Service, New York City  All I remember about this job was that the boards where the old fashioned, plug-in type (yes, just like in Auntie Mame) and that the nut who ran it kept running around screaming, "Answer in up tones,  UP  tones!!"   Gourmet Foods Counter, Bloomingdale's, New York City  I've talked about this before.  I never ate so well.   Cologne Sprayer, Aramis Counter, Macy's Herald Square  Mostly people act like (a) you're about to spray them with insecticide or (b) like their a five-year-old playing in the sprinkler.  Retail is hell as it is, worse if it's holiday season in the busiest store in the world and you're doing the most reviled job (okay, I guess the elves have it a little worse).   Phone Sex Moderator, Empire State Building, New York City  These lines had just started, basically as chat lines, and our job was to keep people chatting.  Nothing explicit could be said (Congress was allegedly monitoring), and since the company didn't want the callers to know we were operators, we had to make up personalities and voices to keep people chatting.  My most popular was Max, the aerobics instructor.   Entertainer, Various Cruise Ships, Carribbean, Mediterranean, etc.  Let's just lump these all together, shall we?  Sure, you get to travel for free.  Yes, the food is great.  But it's not quality work, folks.  I've never been so drunk or so tan.   Clerk, Actors' Heritage, Times Square, New York City  This was one of the first of those cheesy stores that sell music and knick knacks and beach towels and match boxes with shows' logos on them.  Also, piano scarves.   Waiter, 14 Christopher, New York City  I started here on Halloween night, when the parade was smaller and gayer and the Village would get packed.  I never felt more like a waitress in a truck stop.  Quit when the chef refused to give me my food unless I stroked his cock.  It's a MAC store now.   Secretary, Greenburger & Associates Literary Agency, New York City  A customer from the restaurant put in a word for me, and soon I was working in a high-class literary agency, for a delightful English lesbian and a drunken, irascible lech.  Still, I felt classy.  The took me to the Algonquin for lunch and upstate for weekends.  But then the loud, faux-French agent got ahold of me and asked me to clean out her purse and empty her vases and I was outta there.   Candy Butcher, Sweet Stuff, Christopher Street, New York City  Every bit as good as it sounds.  I was in my twenties with a high metabolism, so I could eat my fill of it all, and flirt with boys all day long.  We had the hottest beat cop on Earth and my manager insisted on blowing me in the stock room on a regular basis.  Why, why did they have to go under?  It's a gay boy clothing store now.  This is longer than I thought and we're really only up to like 1985.  To be continued...

      I've decided to be poor.  Well, I didn't exactly decide it.  I just seem to be.  And yet, it's paying off...  After deciding that certain bills needed to be paid and, to enjoy myself on an upcoming vacation, money needed to be saved, I gave myself a too-strict budget:  from last Thursday until this Thursday, spend only $30 dollars.  I'd stocked the loft with food, had the monthly MetroCard (which conveniently expires Wednesday night), and I only needed to buy lunch at work which, on the South Beach Diet, is pretty cheap.  But Thursday night, I got a call from a guy I'd forgotten I'd have drinks with.  Damn.  I couldn't put him off again, especially since (a) he sounded interesting (a journalist with a good voice), and (2) he was off to Brazil and goddess-know-where for many weeks.  Okay, what the hell.  I downgraded drinks to coffee and met him that evening at  urlLink Cafe Reggio .  Survey says?  He was nice but dull.  No, not dull, just far too passive.  I yammered on, fueled by Reggio's espresso.  He seemed to be amused, but I wasn't.  Still, I was only into it for three bucks.  Turns out, he liked me:  he bought coffee. Thursday:  $0  Friday afternoon there was grilled salmon in the board room at work, over-ordered for a meeting that didn't happen.  I called it lunch.  Friday night I figured I'd work on my room.  Still stuff to put away, could certainly use a good dusting and sweeping.  But my pal, ChiChi A wanted to go to dinner.  At the risk of sounding pathetic, I said that I was staying home, Forman-ing some chicken breasts and sweeping.  Seems he felt he'd been neglecting me, plus he was too antsy to stay at home and he insisted on taking me to  urlLink Cafeteria .  Usually hate the snotty, twelve-year-old waiters there, but the meatloaf is excellent.  And CCA, who's usually a little emotionally distant, really opened up.  We had the best talk we've had in years, talked about all of our old friends and baffling situations we've found ourselves in.  It felt like we'd ascended to another, even-more-comfortable level of our relationship.  Plus, I loved the meatloaf. Friday:  $0  Saturday was glorious.  I woke up a little late and, after walking Dex, decided I needed a good, long bike ride through Brooklyn.  I biked mostly through Williamsburgh, then down by the East River, by the Navy Yards (taking lots of pictures), through glorious Vinegar Hill (happening on this house,    urlLink rachcon_ed_house.bmp   which was once the Commandant's House and belongs on Cape Cod, not on the East River), then down through  urlLink DUMBO , to the Brooklyn Bridge.  Considered having some Brooklyn Ice Cream, but slugged back some water instead and started back home.  On the way back, I ran into Kat (and her philosophy professor husband), whom I've known since my first summer of stock in '84 and haven't seen for a couple of years.  Big reunion, invitation to their new Caribbean home!  On they way back home, a call from ChiChi A telling me  urlLink the film we'd talked about  had opened at the Quad and he'd bought tickets for 8:20PM.  I'd budgeted for this, so I showered, ate, and met him at the theatre.  An okay film, followed by a turkey burger at Johnny Rocket's. Saturday:  $15  Sunday was rainy and I slept late again.  Couldn't really give the Dex a good long walk, and absolutely nothing on tv but Jesus documentaries.  Phone rings.  JSquared calling.  Somehow has tickets to the last preview of " urlLink Assassins " that night.  I'm SO there.  It was everything I knew it would be.  I was sure it had died after Playwright's Horizons so many years ago, and then again after September 11th.  But there it was.  Glorious.  Brilliant.  Even Mario Cantone.  Hung out at JSquared's house afterwards. Sunday: $0  I'd promised Pongo, my ex, I'd go to the premier of his brother's new HBO movie at the  urlLink Museum of Television and Radio  on Monday night.  Monday morning he called to tell me he'd forgotten that there was also dinner following at  urlLink 21 .  21?!  Legendary.  I'd always wanted to eat there.  Of course, all my nice jackets are in storage.  Pongo said he'd look for one, and we arranged a meeting spot.  The movie, " urlLink Strip Search ," directed by  urlLink Sidney Lumet  (who was sitting right in front of us), is disturbing.  Great television and it's bound to be controversial, as HBO seems to be backing off of it already.  Some of the cast were there, Glenn Close, Dean Winters, an amazing Ken Leung, Jim Gaffigan.  But, because of Lumet, there was some older Hollywood as well:  Dina Merrill and Sylvia Miles (granted, she'll come to the opening of a can of tuna -- and hilariously was in a black trucker hat, with big mirrored letters on it spelling out "FAME") but, most startlingly, Sean Connery.  I mean, c'mon Sean Connery!  The theatre hushed when he stepped in.  He sat two rows in front of us (and was at the next table at dinner and incredibly nice).  21 was spectacular.  After telling people what I knew about it (that it had been a speakeasy during Prohibition, and that a special door was built into one of the vaulted arches in the cellar that led to a private bar), our friend Irene, repeating the story within earshot of one of the managers of the restaurant, scored us a private tour.  Amazing that it all  urlLink still exists .  A lot of the "Oz" and "Homicide" boys were there, Lee, Dean, Richard Belzer.  Of course, as always, I became a 14-year-old girl in front of Chris Meloni.  I mostly chatted with his wife, since I can't look at him for too long and still breathe.  A fantastic night, really, and Pongo was very sweet.  It's nice to settle into that sort of relationship with one's ex-husband.  Even if he is trying to marry me off for all the wrong reasons. Monday: $0  My lesson?  I can live on the fringes of my rich and famous friends' lives and still be happy!  I understand now, how the rich stay richer.  This weekend, even the poor stayed richer.  Yet, I demand my own celebrity!  Where's my FAME trucker hat?  I have to be at least as interesting as Sylvia Miles, no?  So now, with my excess dough, I think I'll go harrass a really cute bartender at happy hour.  Maybe he'll buy me a ...

      Yesterday, I only spent a quarter.  All day long, only a quarter.  I don't think I'ver ever done that before -- at least not in the City.  I made breakfast at the Swanktuary.  Used my monthly MetroCard.  Had all the free Diet Coke and coffee I wanted at TempWorld.  Brought a little turkey with me for lunch.  Still hungry, I found that there were sandwiches left over from a meeting (from which I scooped the grilled chicken and salmon).  Later, at a birthday celebration, there were pastries (which I didn't touch) and cheese (which I speared like a, er, a tribesman, that ummm, spears, um, things).  MetroCard home, sirloin burgers for dinner, followed by fat-free ricotta cheese and vanilla, tv, continued straightening up my room and a quick check on things at  urlLink my new, favorite website .  Some Law & Order, a  urlLink surprisingly entertaining movie  from Netflix with  urlLink Michael , a little dogwalking, and bed.  All on a quarter.  And what was that quarter spent on, you may wonder?   urlLink My Guilty Pleasure .

Apparently, Avo thinks I'm just another fag.  That would be like saying he's just another freak  I'm groovin' on East Williamsburgh.

       Still Faggy After All These Years...  So I sent out a little change of address email to random people.  Decided to send one to Rich Lawyer Guy.  Get an email back from him saying he's in LA for some porn convention (he has a client that's a high-profile "model" with a tendency to fall out of windows), but would I like to go see Barbara Cook when he gets back to the City.  I pretended to think about it, but he knew my weakness for aging Broadway divas.  I mean, what if she sang 16 bars of "Flahooley" and I wasn't there?  Now, RLG and I have a weird little history.  We were set up by a girl I worked with Off-Broadway.  He came to see the show, we went to Orso afterwards and the game was on.  While I liked him and we had a lot in common, there was no chemistry for me.  But I enjoy being chased.  I also enjoy being sent rare Broadway performances on video, going to opening night parties, meeting directors and producers and stars I'd generally not get to hang out with, etc.  But at one opening night party, I went to the bar to get us drinks and overheard someone at the other end of the bar saying, "Did you get a load of RLG's new boy-toy?"  I was horrified.  Also very pleased.  I mean, at the time I was in my mid-late-thirties and I wasn't boy nuthin' but it was sure nice to hear.  But it occurred to me that, since I was about 10 years younger than RLG, no one was really taking me all that seriously.  So...I became harder to get and then eventually impossible to get and then I moved away.  Dinner was actually nice.  We hadn't seen each other in about three years and it was fun to catch up.  He's quite smart and plugged-in to all the good Rialto dish, plus he was genuinely interested in hearing about New Orleans and what it was like to be home.  Then we strolled over to Lincoln Center for the show.   urlLink Barbara Cook .  I'm not one of those rabid Barbara Cook fans.  But she's held a special place in my heart since  urlLink Follies In Concert .  She won me over even more.  And those songs!  Yeah, I'm a total Musical Theatre Fag.  I loved listening to all those Rodgers & Hammerstein songs.  All the " urlLink She Loves Me " stuff (including "No More Candy" that, frankly, hearing her sing live was worth the whole evening).  I did have a bit of a scare when she started into "Glitter And Be Gay," but that resolved itself.  And yeah, she lost her place a couple of times, but still it was, oh hell, it was  enchanting .  I'm the HomoGay...what's your point?  After the show, RLG introduced me to  urlLink Lauren "Call me Betty" Bacall ,  urlLink Julie Harris , and oddly-as-thrilling  urlLink Florence Klotz .  So I was a little off-balance when RLG asked if I'd like to see his new apartment...  63rd Floor.  Three bedrooms, three baths.  Views like you can't believe, including, most poignantly, a direct view down of my old building.  Ah, well.  As Barbara sang, "This, Nearly, Was Mine."  We had a really terrific visit.  And as much as I like him, as similar as is our taste, still no real spark for me.  And trust -- if anything was gonna have me scour my soul for spark it was gonna be this li'l piece of real estate.  It sucks to be me.  But, hopefully, we can be the good friends that we should be.  And if not, I had a thrilling night of the music I love most and a nice piece of salmon.  Maybe it doesn't suck so much to be me...  (It would be nice to get laid sometime this year, tho.)

      Something's been bugging me since yesterday and I have to bring it up, although it's probably none of my business.  I think, normally, I could've just rolled my eyes and moved on, but in light of the Neo-Puritanical Bushian Patriot Act Era in which we live, I've got to say something.  Jeff writes  urlLink Biologic Show .  We've never met, but I started reading his blog because we have mutual New Orleans connections.  I continued reading because he says lots of interesting things in an interesting way.  Yesterday he wrote about  urlLink his experiment with crystal meth , which he examines (and I think he'll expound on it even further) pretty objectively, pro and con.  His life, his blog, his opinions, right?  Not according to  urlLink Victor .  Victor, who's site I've read occasionally (but won't anymore), has a huge problem with not only Jeff's experimentation but with the fact that he wrote about it.  From what I've read on Victor's site, he comes from a pretty narrow-minded, Christian-based background, but managed to move beyond that and live his own life his way, in San Francisco, beyond the (assumed) disapproval of his family.  But he doesn't seem to have adapted a live-and-let-live attitude.  Instead, he's chosen to attack Jeff (and from what I understand, so have others, presumably from Victor's circle, and in some instances involving death threats), ridiculously calling that entry "a beautiful advertisement for more gay men to use crystal meth."  Uh, yeah...we're just that suggestible.  I read "American Psycho," too, and I have yet to carve anyone up with a buzzsaw.  I'm just sayin'.  My point is not to support or condemn drug use or the possible debilitating effects of crystal methamphetamine on the gay community.  What I'm saying is, the guy has a right to live his life, and write about it and his experiences, without being condemned and/or having his life threatened.  Isn't that one of the basic rights of being American?  And especially a gay man in America?  I've read one or two things in Victor's blog that middle-America would find questionable, but you know what?  It's his life and he should feel free to live it (or screw it up) any way he wants.  As should we all.  People in gay houses shouldn't throw stones.  You have an opinion?  Great, voice it.  A judgement?  Keep it to yourself.  And as far as acting on your opinion, going out of your way to see that someone else tries to live the way  you  think they should, I have a few words to say about that:  Stonewall.  Selma, Alabama.  Rowe v. Wade.  September 11, 2001.  I'm not particularly political.  Really.  I'm not smart enough.  Nor am I at all religious.  I just believe that our minds, our bodies, and our lives are ours to with as we see fit.  I mean, I don't understand why committing suicide is a crime...shouldn't you be able to hit the restart button on your own life?  Who am I to tell you that your life continues to be bearable?  And who am I to tell you what you can or can't put into it or take out of your own body?  Christ, I sound like I'm one step away from singing folk songs and weaving my own fabric.  I just wanted to support  urlLink Jeff .  As long as he's not hurting anyone else, he's got the right to make his own decisions.  And certainly to write about them with impunity.  That's all.  I'll return to my regularly scheduled snarkiness later this afternoon.

      I just went to a job interview.  I have no idea if they liked me, although generally, until they get to know me, they do.  I can fake sincerity like nobody's business.  This is a job I could easily do and one which I'd probably be pretty good at.  I might even enjoy it and make some money.  So I'm definitely not getting it.  Definitely.  Also, twice during the interview, I had to remind myself not to cruise the gentlemen who where interviewing me.  While batting my eyes and touching myself inappropriately has, in the past, gotten me jobs, they've never been long-term, er,  positions .  I used to get job offers all the time.  Still do.  I go temp somewhere, or spend time talking to someone in a party, and they think I'm all smart'n'professionial, organized and on top of it, and before long they're offering me a job.  It's invariably doing something I would never in a million years (nor would anyone in their right mind) want to do.  Like being Lainie Kazan's personal assistant.  Or it might be something that, on the surface might seem glamorous, but would be an inordinate amount of dull work that would preclude having any personal time and probably cost me to do.  Like being Lainie Kazan's personal assistant.  I've been offered positions as varied as literary agent, food buyer, legal office manager, visual merchandiser, nanny, travelling companion/houseboy, and Lainie Kazan's personal assistant.  Of course, all I've ever wanted to be is an actor.  Which I've gotten to do, quite a bit.  But not enough.  Unlike all those other "civilian" jobs, nobody in show business knows quite what to do with me.  My very first audition on a Broadway stage, for "Biloxi Blues," the casting director called my agent and said, "He's so great, his look is great, but he comes off as too old."  It's always something.  I'm not handsome enough.  I'm too handsome.  I'm not twenty. I don't fit the costume.  I was Lainie Kazan's personal assistant.  Something.  I've always had these other careers to subsidize the career I want.  And these other careers always want me.  Maybe, like boys, they want me because I don't want them.  And now that I want one of them, it's playing hard to get.  Junk food for thought.  Soooo I went to this interview and they were nice and all and I wore a new orange shirt and felt all awkward and I think they might've liked me but who really knows what they were thinking and it's probably too good to be true anyway and if I get it then what? do I suddenly stop acting or can I do both even though I've been ignoring one and if I got it would I maybe make the transition unless of course I wasn't good at that either but I'm sure I would be which is why I hope they'll call and why I'm pretty sure they won't.  I hate me.  I wonder if I still have Lainie Kazan's phone number?

      Okay, I'm not sure how this happened, but Friday night I was reasonably cute, got pretty loaded, was very chatty, allowed my nipples to be touched repeatedly, and even showed my secret tatto and I   still   left single.   Hello?   Granted, most of them had boyfriends and stuff, and there were a couple of cute bloggers I never got around to meeting (probably being monopolized by those bloggers who already had boyfriends), but still.  So since I can't get a date in the City, I've decided to go for a job interview on Fire Island this weekend.  I mean, if a bartender can't get a ummm,  date  on Fire Island, then the world's a very sad place.  Unless anyone would like to reconsider having passed my by...

         It's been three years since I started blogging (although, yeah, I took a longish hiatus somewhere in there).  Since the beginning, though, it expanded my universe.  I've met and dined with bloggers, met and slept with bloggers, traded a king-sized bed and assorted furniture for a life-saving laptop with a blogger, met and moved to the South to became roommates with bloggers, become good friends with bloggers who are way to cool to have befriended me, moved back to New York and became roommates with bloggers,  turned non-bloggers into bloggers.  Many bloggy things.  And, exponentially, it's led to many other fascinating (but mostly not fascinating) things.  I've even (mostly) gotten over the awkwardness of having to explain to civilians that I know someone through my blog and not have it sound like dirty Internet porn.  Let's face it:  I've been around the blog.  Why, then, does  urlLink tonight  give me pause?

      There are, actually, a few advantages to being a surprise, unwanted kid (or "the accident" as she liked to call me) to a middle-aged mother.  In the first place, she's gonna make damn sure  that  little slip never happens again, so you're guaranteed never to have to share a room or anything else while you're growing up.  Second, since there's zero maternal instinct, the first few years of your life will be catered.  I literally got a menu at the end of the week from a delivery service, I checked off the boxes for each day, and hot food was delivered to the door (which I generally took to my room and ate alone).  But probably the best thing is, to avoid contact and any expected display of affection, you'll be encouraged to have lots of activities away from the house (hence, lots of theatre and rehearsals) and you're gonna get practically any toy you want (as long as she's sure it'll be a distraction and you promise to take it to your room, play quietly, and not bother her).  I had a spectacular collection of toys.  Don't get me wrong, we didn't have a lot of money, but keeping me out of her way was worth any price.  I had  urlLink Spirographs  and  urlLink Incredible Edibles  (less "sissified" than the Easy Bake Oven I really wanted).  I had chemistry sets and architectural blocks and Legos.  I had lots of board games, but, being an only child, I either had to play both sides by myself, which became tedious, or invent new games with the boards and pieces, which was fascinating.  All of the  urlLink "Planet of the Apes" action figures , including Dr. Zais' treehouse lab.  And, in some spasm of trying to get me to "butch it up," I got action figures.  Oh yeah.  My first G.I. Joe talked.  You pulled his string and he said (I kid you not): "G.I. Joe, ready for action, sir!"  Uh huh.  I also got  urlLink Big Jim .  Big Jim was hot.  Very Seventies.  He could make a steel band pop off his bicep when he flexed it.  I loved him from the minute I saw him.  Big Jim had a pal, Big Josh.  They were both muscular and shirtless.  They had a  urlLink camper and a tent and a private jet .  There were not Barbies or Skippers in sight.  You do the math.  Thinking about it now, I spent most of my youth either rehearsing or performing, or in my room (read: studio) eating take-out food and playing with muscular guys.  No wonder moving to Manhattan was the easiest transition of my life.  So, yesterday, trying to find a link to explain to  urlLink Today's Youth  just who  urlLink Jonny Quest  was, I found a link to action figures on eBay and, eventually, some Big Jim action figures up for auction.  And the "Planet of the Apes" stuff, too.  Now, at some point I got all altruistic and charitable and gave a lot of my toys away to Toys For Tots.  Being a Virgo, they were all in great shape and, in most cases, in their original boxes.  I figured I'd never play with them again, they were just sitting in the attic, and some underprivileged kid (other than me) should enjoy them.  How was I supposed to know I'd be 40 and still want 'em?  But I am and I do!  I'm sure a lot of them are still in her attic.  Frankly, she's had a rich full life and I want my money.  But it seems easier to just bid on some of them on eBay.  I feel another collecting obsession coming on.   Ready for action, Sir!

      I felt the weight of time last night.  It was strange and familiar, like finding an old love letter and re-reading it.  Well, not a love letter...  "The Normal Heart" was first produced in 1985.  A different New York and a different me.  Sitting in the theatre last night, I was uncomfortably aware that this is now a period piece, and a period during which I was thriving.  And which I, miraculously, survived.  It occurs to me that this wasn't really written as a play about AIDS so much as it was a three-hour long justification by Larry Kramer for his outrageous behavior while co-founding GMHC (not that I believe he needs to justify his actions: history proves him right), although he probably meant it more as a red flag, a continuing alarm.  But twenty years later, the terror and hysteria of the '80s seems crude and almost simplistic; uncomfortable.  The anger is self-important and the bad guys clearly delineated.  But it's all true.  It's a time capsule in much the same way as, say, "A Raisin In The Sun."  I went with a friend who's younger than I am and didn't move to New York until 1990.  He's also HIV+.  He doesn't remember a time when an unnamed killer was sweeping through our community.  For him, it's always had a name and more-or-less a shape.  He doesn't remember the walking scarecrows that just weeks, months before used to be beautiful, desirable young men.  For him, this play isn't a political argument, it's a foregone conclusion.  Dramatic, certainly, but not haunting.  I saw a different play.  Two plays, maybe.  I was in the middle of that time in this City.  I was also here, amazed at how far and how little we've come -- I've come.  How many do you know, one character asks.  I asked myself, too.  I lost Mac.  Ric and Danny.  Hal, Jim, Richard, Tommy.  Steven.  Too many for a twenty-year-old to have counted.  But no so many for a long time now.  Mostly dispelled, the terror of physical intimacy.  Less fear in disclosure of status.  I can measure those things, my friend could not.  He asked me about it after the play.  I told him about Wiley, a cute, skinny boy with hornrim glasses that I met at Cahoot's one night in 1983.  I was living at the Belleclaire, a residence hotel on West 77th Street.  He came home with me and we kissed on my bed.  We started to remove our shirts and Wiley looked terrified.  He asked me if I had It.  I told him I didn't.  He looked unsure.  We tried to kiss some more and he asked again.  I reassured him I was healthy and tried to get his shirt off.  He all but ran out of my room, apologizing, but scared.  I never saw him again, but I remember that night and his face and my shame.  And I was healthy.  Imagine the scenario, played out night after night, for those who were not and knew it.  I'm still healthy.  I'm negative.  It's startling to me that I am.  I have guilt about it.  Why someone else and not me?  Why haven't I done more, given more?  Why am I not more scared, more political?  I'm a period piece, too, perhaps.  In another twenty years, I want to sit in a theatre and watch "The Normal Heart."  I want to be angered by the clunky language and the inappropriate laughter it'll draw from a younger audience.  And afterwards, I want my theatre companion to ask me, "is that what it was really like before the cure?"  I want to feel the weight of history.

      I've got to name him, this new alter ego.  I've considered and rejected "Max," "Dash," and "Kirk."  I think, in a nod to a childhood cartoon crush and because it's ridiculous enough to work, I've decided on: Race.  So far, Race been bery, bery good to me.  Just this lunchtime alone, he got offered a free scone at Starbuck's, comp tickets to " urlLink The Normal Heart " (thanks,  urlLink A.J. ), made one cute guy bump stumble into a pretzel cart (because he was busy looking back at Race) and, after making eye contact with another very humpy guy in Grand Central, watched the guy go down the escalator and right back up again, scanning us while Race and I got coffee (at the above-mentioned Starbuck's).  We would've said hello, but didn't see him once we'd gotten our coffee.  We weren't too worried, though.  A few things I've already noticed about Race:   He's about an inch taller than I am  He's not concerned about what he weighs  He walks much slower than I do  He doesn't furrow his brows like I do  In fact, he sort of smirks most of the time  He enjoys making straight boys nervous by unapologetically cruising them  Is this how  urlLink Sybil  started?  Not that I care.  I mean, this is crazy fun!  I got up early today because I couldn't wait to take Race to work (he was sweet, he made me coffee).  And this is just the beginning.  This external stuff is fun, I like toying with boys, but I'm looking forward to putting Race to work at auditions and stuff.  Hey, I'll take Race with me backstage tonight!  This is probably as close as a Virgo gets to being out-of-control, but I'm digging it.

       urlLink My Favorite Seer  says:   It just ain't natural for a Virgo to be a spectacular exhibitionist. We astrologers might be forgiven, then, if we've wondered how the singer Beyoncé could possibly be a member of your tribe, as she claims to be. Recently, the mystery was solved. In an interview with the "Star," Beyoncé revealed that a character named Sasha takes over her body onstage. "There's no way I'd wear a short little dress and dance like that in front of all those people," she said. I bring this up, Virgo, because I'd like you to consider acquiring your own alternate personality. He or she could help you fulfill your current cosmic mandate, which is to climb to a rooftop or mountaintop or tabletop and do a song and dance dedicated to the person you want to be five years from today.   Okey dokey, then.  I thought about it a lot this weekend.  I had some actor union drama last week that I thought was a sign from the Universe.  Well, actually, it  was  a sign from the Universe, just not the one I thought.  My inital reaction was that it signalled the end of my so-called career.  I didn't want to ask for help, I wanted to just give in.  But I got help anyway, and from the very top (well, not the very,  very  top like Jeebus or anything).  And by the end of the week, things were, well, ummm... better .  (And, yes I  am  getting a commission from italic use today, thanksfernoticing.)  You're week is definitely better when Hugh Jackman is shaking your hand.  Definitely.  In the middle of the alleged drama, JSquared said an interesting thing to me:  "You get stubborn about the strangest things."  Not that he's one to talk, but, yeah, I guess I do.  Or rather, not stubborn, but perhaps bogged down.  I see a wave of this nonsense coming and, instead of just letting it wash over me, I open my mouth and drown a little.  Never completely, but I get plenty of salt water up my nose.  So I biked this weekend.  I biked from the Swanktuary, over the Williamsburgh Bridge, around lower Manhattan, up to the Ninth Avenue Food Festival, back through the Flatiron, the East Village and home again.  Really cleared my head and made me feel, I dunno, sensible maybe.  Riding makes me feel so free in an odd way.  And I did, I felt the City was mine and all of my bike rage dropped and I thought about the nonsense and JSquared's comments.  I thought about the second most repeated phrase directed at me this week, "I wish you could see yourself the way I see you."  I kept coming back to Rob Brezny's horoscope.  The concept isn't unfamiliar to me.  It's a thing I learned as a kid that I've often applied to acting.  I haaaaaated school.  I was a skinny, faggy, smart kid, so I did what I could to stay out of school as often as possible.  But I would commit to my pretend illness so fully that sometimes I'd forget I wasn't sick and start feeling poorly.  And, as an adult, I've applied that method in rehearsals and gotten good results.  Maybe it's a form of self-hypnosis, or maybe I'm just a delusional drama queen, but it's worked for me.  Even during awkward moments in bars or clubs, I've pretended to be cool or sexy or unbelievably good-looking and not only would I get some response from other people, I'd buy into it just enough to dispell the self-consciousness.  So I biked and I wondered, I wondered and I biked:  Would this work on a larger scale?  I've never tried it for longer than, oh, a half-hour or so.  Is it too artificial?  Could Beyoncé be right (she is, after all, a Virgo...she can't be that wrong)?  The experiment starts today.  I bought new shoes and sunglasses.  I've got some good color from my ride yesterday.  I popped in the contacts and worked-in some new product on my freshly-buzzed head.  I smirked all morning, but also remembered to smile.  We'll see.  I haven't named him yet, but I guess I oughta (especially if the looks in Grand Central station at lunchtime are any indication).  I like the name Max, but I don't think it encompasses enough of what this persona will have to accomplish.  Also it's not sassy enough.  Hey, maybe he'll need his own blog...  Mock if you will.  Mock me blue.  My new persona doesn't give a fuck.

      Lo those many years ago, April of 'Ought One I believe it was, when I started this blog, I had to whittle each entry out of hickory sticks I'd pull from the tree outside my 13th floor apartment on 54th Street.  Now, of course, you kids have it easy, what with Blogger and TypePad and all.  Just push a button and  voila !  So when I saw all the purty new templates on the new and improved Blogger, I just had to have me one.  So I pushed de button.  That was three days ago.  I think my headache's better now.  And the blog does look pretty and shiny and all.  Sadly, the content does not.  I promise to live (and report on) a life that lives up to my new mass-marketed, pre-fab template!  It was easier to write about all aspects of my life when I blogged anonymously.  I mean, only  urlLink One Person  knew my true identity, and he didn't much care.  It was fun making up aliases for everyone and I could be completely honest, even about the horrifyingly embarrassing parts of my life.  Now, too many people find their way here.  And, while blogging's brought me friendships, sex, and even shelter (in two cities, mind you), it's not the same kind of outlet it used to be.  Every blogger goes through this after awhile.  They stop.  They question.  They restart differently.  I've done that all twice.  And still I have no book deal (okay, that's not a huge surprise).  I don't really have the time to blog the way I used to, at least not the way I used to before New Orleans when I was good at this.  Obviously it still interests me, but how does this best serve me?  I know not.  Any suggestions?

      So, the whole restaurant thing...the money was okay, but it was never going to be what it should be.  I refuse to go into details about stuff that doesn't really matter anyway.  I mean, it's booze and nachos, right?  But I was working disproportionately hard to make okay money.  And a manager who was half my age was talking to me as though I were some sort of developmentally-challenged chimpanzee.  Not cute.  I remember when I was having bad dreams about one of my bar jobs in New Orleans, the often wise  urlLink Sturtle  said to me, "if you're dreaming about a job, it's time to quit."  I applied that wisdom to this circumstance and I'm back temping.  I kill me.    I still have some leads on bar gigs, one that would be ridiculously summery and probably ill-advised, being that I'd be entirely surrounded by water and boys, but for now I'll play Jane Hathaway to dull lawyers and investment bankers.  They think I'm funny.  The great news is, after three years tucked away at the very end of West 28th Street, I've retrieved all of my stuff from storage.  Yay, stuff!  It didn't look like that much in my storage unit, but there's lots of boxes strewn around the Swanktuary, added to the stuff that Michael got out of storage not so long ago, and well...boo, stuff.  Oh, but my books!  I have my books again!  And my music!  My coffee maker!  My Tupperware!  And my collection of Broadway props and costumes and set pieces and Venetian masks and, lordy, we have to have a garage sale.   urlLink Glenn  pointed out that some of it can go on eBay.  Who knew I could get $10 for my Veg-O-Matic from the '70s?  Yet, my original cast finale costumes from A Chorus Line don't seem to be worth anything.  But at least all of my things are under one roof now and I'm saving a couple of hundred bucks a month on storage.  Yay, stuff!  I have a lot of stuff to go through and reorganize.  I can't find two things I really want, a rare three sheet of "Merrily We Roll Along" and a huge, devilish mask I bought on the beach at Puerto Vallarta in 2000.  I've found a lot of things that baffled me.  Why, exactly, did I keep an old container of coarsely ground pepper?  Or the lids to pans I haven't owned in years?  I was slightly out of my mind when I moved from 54th Street.  I'm better now.  Oh yeah, I had monster hot sex this weekend.  Yay, sex!

      Yeah, yeah...I survived Pride.  Actually, more than survived: I came out of it with a new job.  I did.  But I'm not really talking about it yet, because, well, that just fucks up good jobs.  And it's fun to be mysterious...  Pride was exactly what it needed to be.  JSquared's brunch on the rooftop was mellow.  White Sangria for breakfast probably helped.  I never made it to the parade, and I would've liked to, but I decided not to have an agenda.  I only get agitated on these festival days (or, really,  any  day) when I have an agenda and other people get in my way.  It's much easier to drift with other people's plans, and so I did.  We got to the Pier dance around 4:30 or so and it was already filling up.  And then?  We danced, we laughed, we ogled.  We pretended to care that Janet Jackson was somewhere on stage.  It was a break, a release.  The music was what I wanted, the company far exceeded.  I cried a couple of times.  Gorgeous.  The night before, JSquared had given me a stern talking to.  As we sat at Viceroy for a cocktail, he started in on me.  Why did I talk so badly about myself?  Didn't I understand that people thought I was crazy when they heard the negativity streaming out of me because it didn't match up to what they saw?  He told me how much he loved me and believed in who I was, whether I did or not.  Couldn't I please try to change how I saw myself.  Of course, this was/is all baffling to me, since I've traditionally held the lowest opinion of myself.  For lots of reasons.  And to just pretend that I didn't, well...it didn't seem sensible or real or even advisable.  Sounded like denial to me.  JSquared asked me to just, for one day, like maybe Pride, to just not say anything bad about myself out loud.  Think the thoughts if I had to, but not dwell on them.  And absolutely not vocalize them.  If I had to say something about myself, it had to be positive.  I told him it seemed hard but, because he cared so much, I'd try.  We were both weepy at the bar and I'm sure everyone around us thought we were breaking up or something.  We didn't care (we generally don't).  And so, I tried it.  I liked it.  It wasn't all that hard.  Yeah, it felt weird.  It's definitely new territory.  But it also felt kinda good.  Changing the tapes, I believe they say in therapy (not the bar).  I'm going forward with this plan and see where it leads.  So...Pride and pride.  It was a good weekend.  How was yours?

      There's a little hootnanny here this weekend.  Actually, there are about 90.  I went through a phase where I had to be at all of them.  Each one with a different outfit.  $40 on a tanktop that came off in the first half hour.  Stupid, stupid pseudo-circuit boy.  Well, okay, it was kinda fun.    I loved the whole thing.  Deciding which parties to go to.  What would we all wear?  Meeting at one persons house for pre-party drinks and final primps and the applying of body glitter.  And then dancing together.  I mean in one big clump.  It was totally non-sexual, just a big love-in.  We knew the all the lyrics and we had tons of in-jokes, and by the end of the night had tons more.  And generally we'd all leave together, sometimes walking home to enjoy the night air and rehash the event.  Then it all became about something else.  The right drugs.  Hooking up.  Moving into a better crowd.  More of the right drugs.  It was fun, but less fun.  And the tight-knit group frayed at the edges.  I stopped doing it all a long time ago.  I really miss it.  At least I miss the idea of it.  I miss how good I looked then.  But then I only looked that good because of the peer pressure.  I miss the anticipation of it; being so excited that my friend Bob and I would call each other every hour, counting down the time until the party.  That little giddy lift you get knowing that fun's ahead.  For one reason or another I missed participating in the last few Pride events, but I got guilted into going to this year's Dance on the Pier.  It starts in the afternoon, right out on the Hudson.  Hot, sweaty, beautiful.  Every once in a while, a delicious breeze works its way off the river and through the crowd, causing all the boys and girls to groan a little and throw their heads back and let it caress them.  The music is happy and, for once, so is the crowd.  Fewer of those vacant grimaces you get at the Roxy.  After sunset, more dancing under the early stars until the fireworks.  Usually accompanied by Judy Garland singing something maudlin.  It's gorgeous.  One year, it rained.  We were so happy, we danced in the rain like eight-year-olds playing wild indians.  After the rain stopped, Cyndi Lauper came out and sang to us.  True Colors.  I'm excited to go, but it's not the same excitement.  Mellower?  Mature excitement (gawd, that sounds awful)?  But I'll be with family.  My real family, the people who've taken the time to know me.  And love me anyway.  There'll be a lot of family I don't know, too.  People I hope are becoming family.  And we'll dance and laugh and sing along to the songs we know.  Appreciating the breeze and each other.  And I'll be proud to be a part of that.  Last year, working at the bar, a lot of the kids (and I say kids, 'cause they were 22, 23 and to Daddy, that's kids) complained to me about Pride.  They didn't get it.  It pissed me off at first, but then it made sense.  They shouldn't understand about Pride, they've got it layered into their young lives.  A march down Fifth Avenue doesn't mean as much to them just because there have been so many marches down that Lavender Line.  They're just gay, not an issue, let's move on.  Good for them.  And good for us.

      I’m sorry...uh...I didn’t...I shouldn’t have wasted your time...ummm, Chris, Andy – I apologize.  It turns out, umm...I’m not gay.   [Turns to leave.  Turns back to podium.]   Actually, I just want to clear something up: I’m very, VERY gay.  Please, I’m a perfect Kinsey 6.  I’ve never been anywhere near a...to one of those...near Lady Parts.  I’m sure they’re chock full o’ Georgia O’Keefe goodness, but for me – not so much.  No offense.  I don’t eat jalapenos either, so...   [Turns to leave again.  Turns back to podium.]   Look, the thing is, I just don’t know what defines my gayness now.  It’s clearly not just about sucking dick anymore, as many a married straight man has proven to me – generally at the Grand Hyatt.  One of these alleged straight guys not only had the nerve to send me an engagement announcement after our hook up, complete with a photograph of he and his grinning fiance, he had the balls to call me a few months later from his honeymoon suite while his new wife was out for a day of beauty, wondering if he could "drop by."  How is that not gay?  But noooooo, he’s straight.  So what the hell does that make me?  Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s terrific that all you kids now can be all "hetero-flexible" – trying a little of everything, like it’s tapas with lube  -- but not having to, you know, declare one way or the other, dammit!  Maybe I’m old fashioned, maybe I’m just a Virgo, but I need labels.  I’ve worked too long and too hard for my faggot credentials (not to mention my non-existent gag reflex) to just let this issue slide.  I mean, what’s gonna happen?  No gay, no straight, we’ll all meld into one, group of loving people and at that rate, in another couple of years, there’s gonna be no Gay Pride.  It’s just gonna be, you know Everybody Pride and what’s the point of that?  The Christian Right will have to change their signs to "God Hates Everybody," the parade will suck and, frankly, if our parade isn’t bigger and more fabulous, then the Puerto Ricans win.  So, all you straight boys – and I know you’re straight because I’m very attracted to you – take note:  Just ‘cause you got the Grab Ass merit badge in Boy Scouts does not mean you can have any rights to my identity.  I don’t care what you did in band camp, this [holds up list], THIS is what it takes to be Queen:   In school, whenever we played Lost In Space, I was always Dr. Smith. "Oh the pain, William."  Worse, when we played Batman & Robin, I was Alfred.  Once I was Aunt Harriet.  In my School Days Memory Book for the year 1968, the section entitled "What I Want To Be" has several pre-printed answers (Fireman, Astronaut, Cowboy, etc.). I made my mother cross these out and in tense cursive she wrote in "Movie Star."  Taking a page from the Gabor Sisters, for the rest of that summer I referred to my mother as "Daaaahling."  Also in first grade, we presented a sock puppet performance of "Hansel and Gretel." I was the Witch (a character actress even then).  When constructing my sock puppet, I insisted my mother use the purply-blue swirly fabric, because "no witch would be caught dead in brown."  I named my first parakeet "Pretty Boy."  My dog now is named Dexter, mostly because I thought it’d be hilarious to scream out in dog runs, "Let’s go, Dex" and turn on my heels like Alexis Carrington on "Dynasty."  I sometimes worry that I don’t have a "signature scent."  In a pathetic attempt to make me butch, a G.I. Joe was purchased for me. I adored him. You pulled his dogtags and he said: G.I. Joe, Ready For Action, Sir!"  Pulling the right dog tags can still get the same response.  Speaking of action figures, to distract me from the Easy Bake Oven I really wanted, I was given some other masculine-character-building dolls: Big Jim and Big Jeff.  Have you ever seen them?  They’re both shirtless, tan, and well-defined (Big Jim can even pop a steel band off his arm when he flexes his bicep). They didn't seem to have girlfriends, but they did jointly-own a camper, a jet, and a racecar.  You do the math.  I used to wish I could become their size so I could go camping with them...be careful what you wish for.  I once surprised my mother for her birthday by dressing in one of her Hattie Carnegie suits from the ‘40s and lip-synching Andrews Sisters songs.  She asked me not to do that again, so the next year, I redecorated her bathroom.  I went out on a date with a VooDoo priest, even though I knew it was a bad idea, because he was wearing that seasons Dolce & Gabbana square-cut bathing suit.  If I’m in an elevator alone, I’ll generally tap dance to make it go faster like the elevator in "Thoroughly Modern Millie."  Sophomore year in high school, I got my allergist to write a note to my coach (just the fact that I had an allergist).  But anyway, he wrote the note so I could be excused from gym, thus sparing me the embarrassment of having to shower with the other boys.  Funny, now I pay Crunch a lot of money every month so I can get into they gym and shower with the other boys.  Anyway, I was put in a class with the other outcasts.  It was me (the biggest fag at Hillsborough High), three pregnant black girls, and an asthmatic Korean, sex undetermined.  Every day we watched "Leave It To Beaver" reruns (which none of us understood), and to keep us active, they taught us to disco dance.  Even several months pregnant those girls could move and helped me to perfect my bump-touchdown-turnaround-bump.  I got good.  I regularly wore a pair of vintage tuxedo tails and a bowler hat to school and a vintage smoking jacket at home (burgundy silk...heaven!).  I still have a smoking jacket.  I was born on the same day as Greta Garbo.  That’s not the gay part – the gay part is that I care.  Every night in order to go to sleep, I had to stack as many original cast albums as my record player could stand (when one finished playing, the next LP would drop), and I would drift off listening to My Fair Lady, The King & I, Oklahoma!, Carousel, 1776, Hello Dolly!, A Chorus Line, Whoop Up!  But I really loved "Funny Lady." Let me repeat that: Not "Funny Girl," "Funny Lady."  It’s the sequel to "Funny Girl."  Even in Queerdom, that’s pretty queer.  Oh, God…I just outed myself about "Funny Lady."  Now, that’s gay.  I guess, the only way out of it is to go through it, so I’ll get myself out of this with a line from "Funny Lady"  "For once I didn't say too much, I didn't say too little, I said just enough and then I walked."

      Thanks to  urlLink Sparky , I have a new Gay Pride battlecry!  The  urlLink show last night  was fantastic.  Really, I had a ball.  Almost two.  Badum-bum.  As I say,  urlLink Sparky  was terrific.  Earnest and funny and cute as a button.  Bonus was getting to see The Rooster, with whom I share a secret past, laden with the scent of Aramis.   urlLink Bob  really should never have given up the theatre.  Of course, if you've spent any time with him at all, you know he really hasn't.  I, too, could hear the bells!   urlLink The Good Doctor  is writing me a show.  That's all there is to it.  The music's too damn good.  And that sculpted ass...  Oh lordy, everybody was funny (or I was drunk, or both).   urlLink Kythryne  and  urlLink Kiri  and  urlLink Jimbo  (woof!) were all smart and kicky.  Oh, and The Hazzards, who I stupidly didn't know, but now that I've seen  urlLink their video ("Gay Boyfriend")  I can't believe I kinda opened for them (and send them hate mail, you might get in one of their shows!).  I'll probably post my piece later or tomorrow, if anyone's interested.  I finished writing it at intermission.  Yeah.  But I actually enjoyed myself and no one threw rocks, so...  After?  Crif Dogs.  Booze.  Things I can't talk about.   urlLink Someone's  cupcakes.   urlLink Out-of-towners .   urlLink AJ  spinning his tits off at The Slide.  I took today off, which was smart, the more I remember last night.  I felt, I dunno, creative, and that's a good, useful, empowering thing.  So I really, sincerely, have to thank  urlLink Chris  and  urlLink Andy  for asking me to do this, it was way better for me than it was for you.  And to  urlLink Hot Toddy  for his sage advice on performing one's own material (and for a couple of great ideas that I stole).  But the "Talking Charlie Down From A Metaphorical Ledge" Award goes to my beloved  urlLink Sparkles .  You really do know best.  You know, better than almost anyone, the intricacies of manipulating a Virgo.  And now  urlLink Glenn  and I are going to bike over to Metropolitan for a little hair o' the dog.  Wish it were a Crif Dog.  How could I have forgotten the cheeeeeeeeeese?

          Standing in the wings, All prepared to start. Usually I'm tense, A pounding in my heart. But now I'm not afraid Those butterflies are gone My act is looking great I can't wait to go on!  Grab a ticket Find your row, kid I am strictly, SRO kid Tell these ougly boubly feelings I'm free  They been banished by a royal decree  And your head feels so good when you finally clear it  If I saw a worry I wouldn't go near it  Come on now  Come on kid  Lets hear it  Let's hear it for me!   Nothing like a little Showtune Therapy to get you ready for a performance.  [For the heterosexuals in the audience, showtune impaired, and  urlLink Adam , "Funny Lady" is the sequel to "Funny Girl" which was a musical about Fanny Brice who was...oh forget it...

      God help me.  Why did I ever agree to do this:   urlLink      Don't get me wrong. Go.  Everyone else will be funny and charming and have actually written their pieces before getting there.  Me, not so much.  I just got overwhelmed this weekend.  A lot of it having to do with being backstage at other people's shows.  It's hard to listen to people bitch about being on Broadway.  And they have every right to, but it's still kinda hard for me to listen to.  Don't get me started on the whole "Hey, what are you up to these days?"  I don't have an answer to that.  How do you say "temping" and make it sound more exciting than it already is?  Or make "attempting celibacy" sound glamorous.  So, to paraphrase Mr. Sondheim, "I think I'm gonna fail, so if you wanna see me fail, I'll do it happily but wouldn't it be funnier to go and watch a funeral or something?"  Something fantastic did happen last week that I didn't really talk about because I was absorbing it.  Still am.  Awhile back, a Google search (with apologies to Jan, who apparently isn't a lesbian) led an old friend back to me.  Of course, I was still in since he's a big deal executive and he travels to New York quite a bit, so this past Tuesday, after 25 years, we had dinner and discussed, well, everything I guess.  Who we'd been, who we are, who we'd done, who we missed.  Have you ever done that?  Sat down with someone you were close to as a kid and sorted it all out?  I hadn't.  It was as though I'd left my body.    Dino and I used to do shows together in that place where I grew up (I've decided no longer to call it by name).  I spent a lot of time at his house.  His mother, in my mind, was more of a positive force in my life than my own, and I only knew her for six years of my life.  And Dino (and our core group of fags and hags) is my adolescence.    Being slightly neurotic, I was afraid after all this time he'd hate who I'd become.  Or maybe I wouldn't like  him .  Foolish, because the minute he stepped out of the elevator, I loved him all over again.  He's beautiful and so goddamned smart and successful and funny and open and, really, I promise not to wreck his marriage, but I love his   SO   much.  And it's pushed open all these windows to my childhood.  Or maybe just wiped some clean so some light can filter through again.  He doesn't remember me as a loser.  I was popular then.  With potential.  And undeniably talented.  It's crazy to see myself the way I was back then, because I've veered off that path.  Hell, I've apparently taken the wrong exit and crashed into a fruit stand (don't ask -- I lost myself in that metaphor, too).  But what a fucking gift.  And to have Dino back in my life...seems to much to have asked for and unreal and, and...fantastic, as I said.  I now return to my panic attack.  See you tomorrow...if you dare...

      I was stood up.  As predicted and, frankly, as hoped for.  I only said yes to the stoopid date because (a) he seemed fragile, and (2) I knew he'd flake.  He flaked.  Of course, I called him on it.  He claimed he didn't have my number.  Uh huh.  Even if that's true, he had plenty of ways to get it.  He asked if we could reschedule, and I said no.  So I will now take the veil.  No more fast food sex.  And no more dating.  Too weird, too hard, too distracting, too expensive, too annoying, too disappointing.  Maybe I'll stumble across someone, but I think I've had mine for this life and it's time to start embracing my confirmed bachelorhood.  Until, of course, I'm allowed to marry my dog.

      So maybe attempting celibacy the same week I'm linked by  urlLink FleshBot  is a bad idea.  Or maybe it's brilliant: you know how the gays love a challenge.  So, at least until we see how this pans out, I'll still put out.  But if you're offering, it better be worth it.  I'm mostly a top, so big dicks have limited appeal.  However,  urlLink Madonna  tickets are nice.  Weekends away, IKEA furniture, Penguin shirts.  Narcotics.  I probably won't mention this ever again, but I'm a freak in bed, so it makes my impending celibacy doubly sad and my auctioning it off all the more intriguing.  At least to me.

      I just got asked out on a date.  Not "we should have dinner sometime," or "let's go to the movies," or "wanna hang out on Saturday."  No, he walked right up to my desk and mumbled, "would you like to go out on a date with me this week?"  I haven't been asked out on a proper date...maybe ever.  So I said yes.  Never mind that I've known this guy for years, we've had sex several times (although I don't remember if it was good or not, which should be a sign, but I do remember that we were in a very hot, spontaneous four-way once), and he's in recovery.  I find people in recovery programs disproportionately sincere.  Plus, it's my understanding that your first year of recovery should exclude new romantic entaglements.  Eh, it's just dinner.  It comes, though, on the heels of a decision I'd made this weekend.  You'll be surprised to hear I was a little depressed this weekend.  Shocking, I know.  So I did a lot of biking and thinking and on Sunday even decided that it was okay to expose my flesh unto the ball of fire in the sky.  Biked to the Christopher Street Piers and didn't even feel all that self-conscious, although I did feel somewhat white and flabby.  Except for my arms, which were already a little burnt from the previous day's riding with a sleeveless shirt.  I stretched out, listening for about the twelfth time in a row, to B*witched singing "C'est La Vie" followed by umpteen listenings of "Jane Be Jane" by Ben Folds.  I started laughing out loud at myself for playing them over and over so often.  Oh yeah, the decision.  An extremely sexy lawyer that I've dated, er, hooked up with a couple of times was out there.  Shirtless, of course, because he's a little exhibitionist and with that 27-year-old tight body should be.  I saw him off on the side of the lawn, chatting away on his phone, so I called him.  Very "this call is coming from the basement."  Eventually he came over and hung out with me, oddly not embarrassed to be seen talking with me in public. I even got kissed.  But he's not datable.  Smart, sexy, very compatible in bed, adorable personality, but he's an enormous horn dog and it makes him not datable.  And after he left, I thought about how much time I spend thinking about guys who aren't datable.  Then I thought about what a great time I'd had with me, biking and singing along to B*witched.  And I decided right there not to date anymore.    Except for Thursday night.  But, don't worry, with his history Thursday probably won't even happen.  I'm not necessarily doing the celibacy thing again, although I might be.  I'm just gonna get to know me better and not worry about boys.  I'm gonna dress for me, and take myself to dinner and biking and the movies and, if I've enjoyed myself, maybe give myself a little somethin'somethin' at the end of the date.    But I don't need to involve other boys in this.

      Even though it was just a Thursday night, I learned something yesterday.  I didn't expect it and, indeed, I wasn't looking for it, but that's the way all great life lessons come, right?  I very nearly missed it, this physical and spiritual awakening that has caused me to see life and the world in a new way.  As a matter of fact, when presented with the concept, I balked.  But I didn't let it go, I stayed with it, instinctively knowing there was more for me there, and I got to that place between the spaces where I saw the opportunity to expand my Universe.  And, you, too, may well try to dismiss this lesson.  You'll look at it and look away.  Or dismiss the simplicity of it.  But it's deceptive.  It's complex simplicity.  Also, I'll say this: it's not what you think it is.  Laugh, but explore.  And for those of you who ignore the real lesson in the concept I'm going to share with you...well, you're just not ready.

      I've learned to stop fighting my Inner Showtune Queen.  Since yesterday evening, I've been singing a song in my head, but it wasn't until lunchtime today that I realized I was doing it.  I guess it's how I've always related.  So, with apologies to Tim Rice (who I suspect wouldn't mind so much):    Oh what a circus! Oh what a show! America has gone to town Over the death of an actor called Ronald Reagan We've all gone crazy Mourning all day and mourning all night Falling over ourselves to get all Of the misery right  Oh what an exit! That's how to go! When they're ringing your curtain down Demand to be buried like Ronald Reagan It's quite a sunset And good for the country in a roundabout way We've made the front page of all the world's papers today  Sing you fools! But you got it wrong Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long Your king is dead, your queen is through He's not coming back to you  It's our funeral too    For Mac, Ric, Danny, Hal, Rick, Stephen, Tommy, and Paul, who are gonna be waiting by the gates to kick some ass, just in case  urlLink he  makes it that far.

      You heard it here first:   It's the new camp classic of the summer.  All the elements are there: a bitchy Paul Rudnick script that's retains the suspense, scenery-chewing performances (especially by Glenn Close and Roger Bart), creepy perfection in the costumes (how much do we love Ann Roth?) and art direction (Peter Rogness, of "Catch Me If You Can" fame).  I thought we'd have a dozen Achilles at every costume party, but I swear if there aren't roving bands of Stepford Wives all over the West Village come October 31st, I'll eat 5,000 perfectly frosted cupcakes (I probably will anyway).  I'm dying to see this again in a house full of queens.  I was laughing at stuff last night's mostly straight sneak preview audience didn't seem to get, but  urlLink my people  will (for instance, as our protagonists get off the freeway on their exodus from Manhattan to Stepford, the shot of the offramp shows two huge signs screaming "Wrong Way").  Plus, there's a little gay subplot.  Paul Rudnick, please marry me (or, at the very least, write me an Off-Broadway show).  And how?  How did I manage to sneak into this exclusive sneak preview?  I can't tell you  urlLink who took me .   urlLink He's  intensely private and I don't wanna blow  urlLink his cover .  But let me just say  urlLink he's  a fucking riot and  urlLink he  can knock back the booze with the best of them (me being the best of them).  I had a great time even though I've never referred to anyone as "bro" and that I had to spend several unsuccessful minutes trying to explain who  urlLink Jennifer Holiday .  So thanks  urlLink Mr. Anonymous .  And expect to see your very first Broadway show, very, very soon.  And now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to get some golden blonde highlights.

      Strange weekend.  How's the  urlLink rat race ?  The rats are winning -- at least in East Williamsburg.  And, apparently, the pit crew works in our apartment.  These are not frightened rats, no sirree.  I stood in the kitchen screaming and they stared at me blankly then went right back to foraging.  If I'd been wearing pearls, I would've clutched them.  I don't do well with rodents and/or snakes.  I didn't faint, but I didn't come out of my room until Glenn made them go away.  More or less.  Michael put poison out on the countertops.  Glenn and I didn't fall for it, but I think the rats might've.  So I think they're gone, but every crinkle of paper makes me jumpy and if my Diet Coke didn't live in the fridge, I wouldn't have gone near that part of the loft.  Say it: I'm a sissy.  I did have a fantastic  urlLink yoga class  and found enormous solace in being a tree.  For an hour and a half I did not think about rats.  Just trees and locusts.  Anybody wanna try out my downward dog?  The  urlLink corpse asana  would be telling later, though.  Also, on Saturday, we learned that Dubya may have kept a promise:   urlLink One Evil Doer Down .  I absolutely shouldn't go to the movies on Saturday nights.  I maybe shouldn't leave the house on Saturday nights, but either way, no movies.  Glenn and I organized the storage area of the loft and then I was antsy, so I went to the East Village to see "Porn" -- I mean, "Troy."  Yeah, Brad's hot, Eric's hot, but battle scenes bore me and Peter O'Toole is old now.  In the front row was a guy whacked out of his mind, sitting by himself giggling and hooting at the most inappropriate moments.  Finally a security guard wandered down the aisle to remove him.  Unfortunately, the security guard was louder and more disruptive than the whacko.  Shortly after that incident was settled, an older guy with a big, loud, crinkly bag containing an assortment of loud, loud food sat across the aisle from me.  I was starting to get really annoyed until I noticed that the sound had stopped.  Instantly.  Well, I thought to myself, even in the dark my sharp glances have their power.  Umm, no: the guy had passed out.  I venture to say he probably died.  I don't know for sure.  Nor do the ushers, who came in, stood over him talking loudly, but didn't even bother to poke him with a stick or anything -- they just ambled away leaving him there slumped in his seat.  It was creepy.  Leaving the theatre I had to step over a frat boy propped against the theatre wall vomiting water all over his Ben Sherman shirt while his friends helpfully laughed at him.  I tried to buy gum, but a drunken investment banker was trying to negotiate with the deli owner.  It seems $1.79 per bottle of beer was too much when buying several six-packs.  He ended up paying $70 for six six-packs.  For a sec, he tried to haggle with me, until I refocused him on the guy behind the counter.  On the way to the subway it was encounter after drunken encounter.  Makes me wonder if it's better to be sober observing or drunk participating.  I'm still deciding.  I'm not sure if it was all of that stuff before it, or the news about Reagan, or the fact that I moved my bed to face a new direction, but Saturday night I had an exceedingly strange dream.  It was long and all I remember now is that I was one of the "Queer Eye" team.  Don't ask, I have no idea what my specialty was.  Perhaps diction.  Anyway, the other five guys had all died at the same time.  All of them.  I was the only one left.  And I remember thinking how everyone would hate me for surviving them.  Then, suddenly, all the media attention was on me.  I had to go to the funeral parlor, which was on a high floor of a very fashionable hotel, where all five bodies were laid out in open caskets, not lengthwise as you normally see, but perpendicularly, presentationally, with the head part raised a little, like they were on display in a window.  I was overcome with emotion for my lost friends and the press was moving in further on me, so I was ushered into an adjoining room to get out of the glare of the lights and photographers.  This was a room where, although the bodies had already been laid out, there were clothes laid out for some sort of corpse costume change.  They asked me to approve them all and, seriously all I remember about that was finding a sort of baby tee and saying to everyone, "this must be Jai's" and then dissolving into tears.  Even overcome with grief in a dream-state I'm bitchy.  That's all I remember.  What, what, what does it mean?  Of course, Sunday was  urlLink Theatre Fag High Holy Day .  As usual, I didn't win.  As usual, if you've slept with me and you were nominated, you didn't win.  But still it was exciting and I live for the Tonys.  I'm gonna change my name to Perry Antoinette.  I am.  Maybe I'll sound off on each individual win later.  If you're lucky, I won't.  At any rate, the strange, strange weekend ended on a sad note.   urlLink Glenn's  mother died.  She'd been sick for awhile, I guess, and as prepared as he thought he was, I think Glenn was surprised by the emotion that came up.  I didn't know his mother at all, but I've grown to know and love Glenn.  He's a good, good guy and it makes me sad to see him sad.  He left this morning for Texas, but send him your peaceful thoughts, he deserves them.  Tomorrow night I'm going to an event with a person and possibly drinks and on Wednesday morning I hope to have stories or blackmail or something.  Vague and intriguing, no?

      Considering my last post, this is probably gonna sound odd.  Yesterday, after TempHell, I went to get my haircut.  (Well, actually, first I went to the Penguin store to get a shirt, and they're rilly, rilly cute, but I can't consider spending $45 on a shirt I'm pretty sure I can find at a thrift store for $10...but I'll probably go back.)  JSquared always cut my hair before New Orleans.  Then during my exile, I cut it myself.  Buzzed it, actually.  Since I've been back, I haven't asked JS to cut it, since it's what he does all day and, as stressed out as his show has been making him, I want to be able to take him out of that stress.  So I've been going to these Russian ladies on Seventh Avenue.  $10, usually no waiting.  Now, these Russian chicks are harsh.  Severe looking, with massive dye jobs and  cum laude  graduates of the Bakker-Messner School of Makeup.  Thank goddess, too, because their over painted, uber-arching eyebrows are the only expression they give away.  While they spit long Cyrillic sentences at each other, to the customers they only growl questions like "How shyort?" or "Squeer byack or nyatchooral?"  There are two ladies (sometimes a third) and one kinda hot-but-mean-looking youngish guy.  Considering it's Chelsea, you'd think he'd be used to getting cruised, but he don't much seem to like it.  The first few times I went, I got Xena, the one in the middle with the flaming orange hair.  If you rolled Silly Putty over a picture of "Here's Lucy" era Lucille Ball and stretched it lengthwise, you'd get Xena.  But she's good.  Definitely ten bucks worth.  Then there's Vivian.  I don't know what her real name is, but since she's blond and works next to faux-Lucy, she's Viv.  She's a lousy barber.  Doesn't listen (or listens and doesn't understand -- or care), picks up her cellphone in the middle of a haircut, and I generally have to ask her to even out the sides of my head.  Her I don't so much like.  But the last couple of times, Viv's chair has emptied before Xena's and so I've endured her tonsorial torture.  I guess I could let someone go ahead of me, if there's anyone else in the shop, or just politely say I'm waiting for Xena (I've seen other guys do it), but, get this: I don't want her to feel bad about herself.  So I petulantly trudge over to her chair and give in to a bad haircut.  And then tip her.  Ummm, what's wrong with me?  I'm really not a nice person, and I generally have no problem being snarky with clueless shopgirls and mindless cab drivers and inattentive waiters.  Why do I care if some mean Russian woman -- who's name I do not know and who, on more than one occassion has butchered what little hair I have left -- why do I care if she feels bad?  Let's face it: I'm some sort of bipolar freak.  With an uneven haircut.  And yet I'm single...go figure...

        Last night I ironed.  I enjoy ironing.  I've spent way too much time deciding which way my bed should face.  I'm the only human who has ever slept on my mattress.  I have no idea what I'll be doing at  urlLink this .  I should probably start writing.  I can understand how people got to me by Googling "famous+suicidals" and "Chris+Meloni+bicep+fetish" and "fat+guy+food+lover."  Maybe even "cruising+for+young+cross+dressing+gay+boys."  But what the hell is with "Charlie+mother+doing+sex?"  I need new shirts.  Maybe a Penguin shirt like Jake Gyllenhaal.   urlLink Glenn  graduates on Thursday.  What beer goes with matriculating?  I need a nap.  I shouldn't have had that scone.  Maybe I should shave my head.  Remember to thank  urlLink Sparky  for the Toxic Mold he left as a house-warming present.  I shouldn't have had those Wheat Thins.  I wonder what kind of crap I can sell on eBay?  Need to reorganize my cd collection.  The alphabetized cast albums and soundtracks are fine, but need to move individual artists and bands into a new binder and separate compilations alphabetically.  Also need to reorganize closet and separate short-sleeve shirts into better groupings and sort long-sleeves by color and weight.  Stop wondering why I'm single.  I wonder how much stuff I can carry back from IKEA?  Maybe I should get a part-time job to pay for Provincetown.  I need to restart South Beach.  Wonder if there are any Wheat Thins left?

      Why the fuck am I so weepy?  All weekend long.  Jeebus.  And every day feeling a little more disconnected.  I could tell you the usual: I'm old, I'm fat, I have no money and no career, I hate my hair and my voice and my feet, I used to be smart, I used to be funny, I used to have a great voice.  But is it all of that?  Actually, reading that back, if it isn't, it oughta be.  I visited an apartment this weekend.  Apartment 14C (deceiving, because it also now encompasses Apartment 14B, as well.  Stunning views of the Village and uptown.  Beautifully painted and decorated; clean lines but not Spartan.  Every room had a lighting plot more intricate than the first act of "Dreamgirls."  Great conversation with interesting people.  But I didn't fit in there.  I couldn't see myself living there, having these friends.  I don't exactly know how to phrase this elegantly, but I'm now too old for my kookiness and mild good looks to be an entree into this kinda world anymore.  I'm not a precocious twentysomething, or a promising thirtysomething.  I'm a kinda loser fourtysomething.  That's not self-pitying, it's just a fact.  And it isn't changing and not bloody likely to.  So, for me no hope of Apartment 14C (and B).  I also visited Connecticut this weekend.  The house, duplex actually, of a friend of a friend who lives with her aged mother, works a dead-end job, doesn't go out.  Two cats.  Won our game of Disney Trivial Pursuit.  I couldn't breathe.  I spent a lot of time on the floor with the dog from next door, who had a touch of arthritis. Despite a surprise trip to Wal-Mart (which is exotic to me, and quite a treat), I didn't really breathe again until the train pulled in to Grand Central Station.  The suffocation of that house was too close to home.  Yesterday I said to the  urlLink Roommate , "I don't really do anything, why don't I have any time?"  He laughed, but I wasn't being funny.  True, for mental health reasons I rode my bike a lot this weekend.  Over the Brooklyn Bridge and back, over the Williamsburg Bridge and a smart lunch with a  urlLink Smart Boy .  Good long walks with Dex.  But if I don't have a life, where does the time go?  And even if I could focus, what would I focus on?  And, more specifically, where am I gonna land?  I guess I have to consider that I've landed.  Somewhere between a suburban Connecticut duplex and Apartment 14C.  Someone call  urlLink Guiness : it looks like I was granted an extension on The World's Longest Midlife Crisis...

My ex, Pongo, was far worse.&nbsp; Pongo was the absent-minded professor.&nbsp; But people found it charming.&nbsp; I'm not  charming  goofy, usually.&nbsp; I'm just  goofy  goofy.&nbsp; Sometimes I run a montage in my head of all my goofiness for the day.&nbsp; It's usually kinda funny, but painful.   But it's funny to get a glimpse of the image that other people superimpose on me when I'm behind the bar.  "You play a lot of sports, right?" "Does your wife mind you working here?" And (my new personal favorite): "You move like a jungle cat behind the bar."  Yeah, a jungle cat.&nbsp; Except my ginormous paws keep knocking over bottles and I spill vodka on my fur.

      How long do you sleep?  I mean if you woke up naturally, how long?  Now, I'll preface this with the facts that (a) I just turned my schedule around and have been trying to work two jobs within it, and (2) my room has no windows whatsoever and so no natural light ever reaches me (it is not, however, a coffin, as several of you have suspected).  I've been sleeping about 10 hours.  T.E.N.  It seems extraordinarily long to me.  I figured seven or eight hours was good.  But with no alarm and no pressing engagements, I wake up on my own after ten hours.  Is that bad?  Do I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (what's it called? Roseanne-Barr?)  Maybe I'm just a world-class sloth.  When I was a kid I used to come home from school (I was a latch-key child) and, until my mother got home (or until I realized I could have high school boys come over...but that's a different post), I'd take a nap that was like a little death.  I can still sometimes nap like that.  And once I'm out, I'm out.  Very little brings me out of it.  And woebetide him who does (did I just make that word up?)!  Before that first cup of life giving java, I'm not the charming, carefree soul I like to think you think I am.  Really.  So I guess this sleep disorder is nothing new.  But, man, I feel guilty about it.  On the other hand, mornings are for going home, not getting up.  After all, I was weaned on "when a downtown baby says good-night, it's early in the morning, Manhattan babies don't sleep tight until the dawn."  So you can't blame me so much for eschewing the 9 to 5 (with all due apologies to Dolly Parton).  It's the whole reason I got into the theatre, so I wouldn't have to get up in the morning.    But somebody's gotta tell me:  is there something wrong with me, or should I rest easy?

ME:  Well, it's late on a Tuesday night...my guess is home in bed. AYM: But will they be coming in later? ME:  You mean, between now and when we close in an hour or so?  My guess is no. AYM: Damn. ME:  Why?  Are you looking for someone in particular? AYM: Well, I'm just visiting for the week from Miami, and I spent too much money on Broadway shows, and I heard this was the kind of bar where I could make some of that money back. ME:  Excuse me? AYM: I've kinda done it before, so I figured I could come in and, y'know, make up for some of the money I spent.  Besides, I wanna see "Wicked." ME:  If you really wanna see wicked, continue this conversation with me. AYM: Was that bad?  I didn't mean to offend anyone, I just heard that this was... ME:  Hope you've enjoyed your water.  Have a terrific night. AYM: Oh.  The Attractive Young Man slides dejectedly off his barstool and out into the night air, contemplating half-price tickets.

      I spent a goodly portion of Saturday night with  urlLink Jonno ,  urlLink Media Mogul /Confidant/Former Slumlord/Raconteur/Gossipeuse (not really, I just like that word).  You know what?  I miss him.  Funny, you live upstairs from a guy for a year and a half, and sometimes you don't see him for almost a week at a time, he's right there, but you don't go down to Big Daddy's for a cheap vodka, and then you end up sitting in a swank hotel, looking out the ginormous porthole window on the slums of Chelsea, ordering way expensive pizza and I couldn't get enough of him.  There's something -- what is it? --  magnetic , I guess, about Jonno.  Although, that doesn't quite cover it.  It's not just that people are drawn to him, they want to be around him.  Ive seen it time and time again.  They want to know who he is, try and make him laugh, buy him drinks so he'll hang around.  It's something that's dark and flashy all at once.  Attention that he enjoys and eschews all at the same time.  A coolness that's edgy and doesn't give a damn that it's cool, which makes him cooler.  When I think how alike we are, it isn't those parts that I think of.  We're dark in sorta the same ways.  We can be moody.  And we know how to enjoy that part of ourselves, while still moving through it.  I wish I knew how to capture the other part of Jonno, that elusive, attractive side to balance out my dorkyness.  In New Orleans, he reminded me that it was all crazy, and I wasn't crazy to think so.  We bitched about how not-New-York it was.  But I remember one great afternoon, right after Dex and I had moved there, a miraculous walk we took together, including a visit to the deserted and dilapidated  urlLink Piazza d'Italia  and sandwiches at Le Marquis.  Saturday night, he actually made me miss New Orleans.  Imagine?  I don't know anyone on Earth who, just by proximity to him, can make me feel more hip and funny and dangerous.  I'm Marty to his Rizzo.   With Jonno, no matter where you are, it's always like  urlLink a night at Factory .  Thanks for hanging out, Lambchop.  Come home soon.

Don't you think that's hot?  ME:  No.  BOY: Well, I do.  I have a really, really big dick.  ME:  Unless it can bend time to the point where I didn't have this conversation, I'm not interested.

      Okay people, looks like you all need a refresher course on this, so let's review, shall we?    When you step up to my bar, don't look bewildered when I ask what I can get for you.  It's not a trick question and, unless you just turned 18, you should have a clue what you'd like to drink.  Assume you'll have to pay for that drink and have your money ready to pay.  If you wait until the drink is down and the bartender tells you the price before you start fumbling through your wallet for exact change, you're also the kind of person who complains about having to wait for a drink.  Guess what you're making people do?  If you're a hustler or a drug dealer and you want to continue to ply your trade in said bar, drink something other than water and tip big.  If you're European, stop pretending you don't know about tipping.  Please don't make ask me to make your martini stronger.  Also, don't ask me to make you a "light" martini.  Don't ask me to "hook you up" and follow it with pantomimed bottle-pouring motions.  It's insulting, since it implies that otherwise I'd be pouring you a weak drink.  Don't complain about weak drinks.  If you can no longer taste the alcohol, what should that tell you?  If you order "white wine" and pay $6 for it, don't complain about the quality.  If you're falling asleep it's time to go home.  Please don't try to tell me you were "appreciating the music with your eyes closed."  Especially when it was Celine Dion.  Thirty-seven fags before you have made the "no fruit" joke.  Sorry if I forgot to laugh.  Bartenders flirt.  They also make drinks.  In the morning, you'll wake up with neither.    You're probably tipping your bartender at least a dollar a drink (if you're not, you shouldn't be drinking at all).  Don't expect anything more for that dollar than you'd do for the same dollar.  The only thing I want at 5am is an egg white omelet.  If you're not an egg white omelet, there's no point in you waiting.  No, I won't show you my dick.  No, I won't stir your drink with my dick.  That's unsanitary.  Unless you're a theatrical agent or a Brewer Twin, if you just write down your number on a bar napkin and shove it at me, it will later serve to wrap up my gum.  Comparing me to a celebrity can be nice.  Saying "if you weren't so fat you'd look like Richard Gere" will only make me call security.  If you're seriously interested in asking me out, wait until your about to leave and ask politely.  If you're seriously interested in asking me out, don't order an Amaretto Sour, Sloe Gin Fizz, Courvoisier & Coke (aka The Ghettotini), etc.  If you're seriously interested in asking me out, don't make out with someone else in front of me (this probably goes for non-bartenders, too, but you'd be surprised how often it happens).  Bartenders hear everything.  9 out of 10 times the bartender is more sober than you are, so he sees everything, too.  If you're dating a bartender, don't sit at his bar and pour out your troubles, monopolize his time while he's trying to make money, or get upset when he pays attention to other customers.  He probably doesn't come down to your corner with a lawn chair.  If you're doing a lot of cocaine and you still can't hold your liquor, I can't respect you.  Foster Brooks was the last funny drunk.  And he wasn't all that funny.    Okay, that's off my chest now.  I'm not really this cranky, just a little tired from trying to work two jobs.  But I'll slow down just as soon as Provincetown is paid off.  And a new laptop.  And maybe an iPod.  But that's all.  And a Penguin shirt.

      I ride the morning train. I have no choice: I leave work somewhere around 5AM. It's a desolate time, but, to borrow from  urlLink Sky Masterson , it's  my  time of day. And it is day --well, morning --even though the sun's not up.  But the people on the subway at 5AM are still the Night People. The Morning People board trains in various stages of begrudging readiness for a day ahead. The Night People are done. And I'm one of 'em.  Not a pretty group, the Night People. Grooming is not a priority, nor are the usual amount of teeth. Also consciousness is not highly prized. I have stepped onto the 5 train to discover every other passenger asleep. Not just asleep, out like so many dentally-challenged lights. Snoring, drooling, mouths agape, belongings spread around them. It's often like stepping into Pompeii, if Pompeii had been a downtown local and all the residents would eventually be nudged awake by a transit cop.  There are regulars. At 59th Street, there's a preppy homeless guy. The first time I saw him, I assumed he'd had an argument with a girlfriend in some nearby Upper East Side tower sending him to sleep on a bench in his Ralph Lauren shorts and Brooks Brothers button-down, waiting out the storm in a quiet place until he returned for a shower before going off to PaineWebber. But the next night, there he was in the same outfit, on the same bench, still impeccably groomed. I've seen him many nights since. When I don't, I worry a little. We look at each other across the platform sometimes, then he stretches out until they come to pressure clean his side of the platform.  At 14th Street, when I switch for the L train, there are three South American girls. Sisters, perhaps. All diminuative, all with dark long hair, all with dark skin and doughy features. One of the sisters has an enormous collection of gaily-colored, overly-pleated, synthetic-fiber skirts. She also wears a man's gray fedora. The never sit on the bench at that end of the platform, instead the squat in a circle, as if casting die or spells.  There is a deaf man who passes out those little cards with the ASL alphabet on them. Once he passes them out (or places it next to you on the bench), he walks up and down the subway car with one hand frantically gesticulating at his side. Because of the crazy look in his eye, I'm guessing this is the deaf version of talking to yourself. Fascinating, but kooky.  New Yorkers know what car to get on in order to be at the closest exit at your stop. I always ride in the first car. At Bedford Avenue, an African American woman in her mid-sixties boards. Wednesdays and Thursdays. She's got very gray hair and a face lined by worry and at least six decades. She dresses, however, like she's part of Snoop's posse: oversized shorts and sports jerseys, matching sneakers, terrycloth wrist guards and head bands, lots and lots of velour. I believe the look is called "hooked up." Although garish, she usually doesn't bother me. Sometimes, though, she has a little game she plays on her phone that requires the sound to be turned up all the way, which makes my commute sound as though Luke Skywalker is trying to defeat Imperial Storm Troopers before we hit Bushwick. She's impervious to my sharp looks.  One of my favorites is the Hot Hipster. I assume he's a third shift programmer for some big investment bank. He dresses very, very well. And, I'm guessing, when the tie is knotted, the sleeves are rolled down and everything's buttoned, he comes across as fairly corporate. But once he's begun to wind down and the tie is loosened and the collar is open and sleeves are up, a secret garden of tattoos appear. They're intricate and colorful. Some of them seen vaguely Japanese in style. It's as though a vine of color were just barely being contained by his business attire, but Ferragamo is losing the battle. I heart him very much.  Sometimes one of the Morning People is up early, an overeager First Year Analyst or something. He's always showered and combed and showing signs of that first cup of coffee hitting his blood stream. He has that morning's paper (we Night People are still finishing yesterday's). He steps on and seems a little startled. Usually he opts to stand, although there are plenty of seats. Those of us who are awake might look him over, but not for long. His energy doesn't match ours at all and I think we probably feel sorry for him, having to get up so early.  Who knows if the others ever notice me. I wear the same shorts every day. I read a lot and laugh out loud and what I'm reading. I make faces. I angle my face so that, in my reflection across the car, I can't see the bags under my eyes or the way my nose curves right. I don't sleep, but I do sing to myself. Once I decided to see if making a mouth out of my fist a la Senor Wences was possible to do without the result looking so elderly. They probably pay me no mind. It's all normal for that hour. Besides, they're crazy and I'm not.

      Let's face it: I've been around the block.   I've been to Nice and the isles of Greece while I sipped champagne on a yacht.  I've even moved like Harlow through Monte Carlo.  Someone asked me the other night at The Cock, "what could happen in here that would shock you?" And I thought, "what could happen anywhere that would shock me?"  It sounds jaded, and it is. But it's also true. I've seen a lot, I've done a lot, I've overdone a lot.  And yet.  And yet, despite my bitter crust, I have soft, gooey center. I have school girl crushes. I fall a little in love with moments in time. I'm easily hurt. I cry readily and copiously. I meet people and I want to help them, make their lives better and their wishes come true, even though I can't do these things for myself. Christ, I once stayed in a relationship I hadn't wanted to be in from the beginning, because I felt sorry for the boy. Forced to say I loved him, a part of me wanted to believe that, if he really loved me, that maybe that would  make  me love him and he'd be happy and whole. You'll be surprised to hear it didn't work that way. He was wounded -- probably always will be -- and I left with just that much more damaged. Damage to the hull, but still seaworthy.  I'm a monster behind the bar sometimes. As patient as I can be, my patience with drunks and idiotic hustlers wears thin early on some nights. Yet the block of ice I laughingly call a heart can melt a little if a kid seems honestly dejected about a bad date. Or someone completely misguided asks for my number. Or honestly and painfully wants to know where he can find love. I respond, maybe, with the part of me that used to be human.  And just as quickly that same part of me believes I  can  make it better. That  that  might be the reason I'm in the world. To take that boy on a date that will change his outlook on the world. That I take a chance and pass my number to the one person who can make me as happy as I can make him. To  be  love and luck and change and light and transformative.  Of course, I'm not that person. Probably won't ever be. And the sadness seeps into every crevice of my weathered hull. The loneliness that I live with, and don't even mind anymore, makes itself known, like a sunburn makes you aware of your skin.  I'll see him leave the bar with someone else, and actually begin to feel hurt. Senseless. Surreal.   Especially for someone who's been around and knows the score.
