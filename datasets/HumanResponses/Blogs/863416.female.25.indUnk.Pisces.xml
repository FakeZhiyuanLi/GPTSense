      So it's Monday again and here I am at the office (again).  Just finished the sessions but I was not able to reach my quota. I won't make any promises anymore because am sick of it.  My weekend was quite busy.  Watched, Day After Tomorrow with my friends from the office last Saturday.  I actually didn't like the movie that much. I found myself dozing off in some parts of the movie because I was sleepy. (oh alright, I had a couple of beers before watching the movie).  After watching the movie, we headed straight to Croc.  Lod, asked me to drink the beer bottoms up from the glass and I did.  (a free beer was involved, mind you)  Dexter then challenged me, well crap! I lost to him.  Oh well, doesn't matter, he's bigger than me. Haha!  I was supposed to meet Jon and the rest of the gang after hanging out with the PS Peepz but I was so dizzy and high at that time that I just decided to go home.  And I was positively reeking with beer coz I spilled a glass on me.  I know I was noisy that time and I clearly remember Lod, unclasping my bra in public because he was practicing on me.  According to Lod, he's going to buy lots of W*** bra's coz he really had a hard time unclasping mine.  Hahaha!!!  Anyway, I went home, slept till noon and woke up to have lunch.  Sunday morning, I spent the rest of the day bugging my brothers.  I now have a sister.  My younger bro, got his haircut and he absolutely looks like a girl.  His hair is straighter than mine. We've been taunting him actually.. hope he gets another haircut. Haha!  Note:  Too bad, I wasn't able to see my college friends.  They were trying to cal me but I was cathing up on my zzz's that time.  Oh well, probably next time.

      There are times when I feel that I am just cruising thru my life.  No goals set whatsoever, just go on with my day to day activities.  I'm afraid, that I'll be forever like this. Unless, I do something about it of course.  Sometimes, I feel that I don't have the power to control my life, I just let the forces of nature take charge.  Althought, there are times where I feel that I am the master of my own ship, that I control my life and that I know where I want to go.  Am I still making any sense?  I suppose not.  I've reached a quarter of my life and I feel that I have not done enough.  I feel old and young at the same time.  I feel that I am not mature enough though there are times, where I feel that I am the most mature person living in my house... the rest are veritable fuckheads.   I want to do a lot of things however I feel that I can't because I have no time.  Though if you would ask me how I spend most of the day, I'd answer you straight to your face that I wallow in unproductive activities.  I guess I am just tired.

      Guess who's back?  Well Ernie (not his real name, if you know of a famous children's show and a yellow character there, whose roommate happens to be Ernie, then that's his real name.. hahahha!)  is back.  Who's Ernie?  Ernie's the guy we picked-up in Galera last November I think.  My friends and I have this crazy habit of asking total strangers to take our pictures so that no one will be left out in the picture.  So he was passing by and Jon asked him nicely (coz he thought Ernie was gay) if he could take our picture so he did.  Jon, thinking that Ernie was gay, invited him for our after dinner drinks that night and surprise surprise, he did join us.  He's a decent guy, really cute and definitely not gay.  Too bad for you, Jon.  Hahaha!  It was a group-pick up to say the least.   Anyway, he sent an email that he'll be arriving in Manila and will be staying in the country till June 11.  Then he texted me that he's going to call me upon arrival.  Well Ernie, went to Galera first for 2 days and yesterday he called me up to let me know that he wanted to meet us.  He actually remembered his promise to burn the pictures to a CD so each of us has a CD that contains 200+ pictures that he took of Galera, Banaue and Amsterdam (including his toilet man! hahahha!)  We tried to make him eat balut at Croc, but he just ate the egg yolk (I myself wouldn't dare eat that, I've never eaten the duck part, never will...).  He was nice to treat all of us for some drinks  (he should, because I was the one who paid for his bill last time in Galera).  Yep, he's a crushie, but just that, a crush.  Nothing more, nothing less. And besides, I think he's taken with someone else (my other friend who happens to be heartbroken right now).    So, now I have to wrap this up so I can go ahead and finish my stuff.  I was late for work mind you just so that I could meet up with them.    P.S.  You might want to check out this quiz...

      It's Monday and I'm here in the office, working on the sessions that I was supposed to finish last week.  How come it's always like this?  Need I ask myself?  Nope!  I have always liked to procastinate ever since I was in college.  It's actually a hassle for me to go back to work (quite expensive too) but I have to.  Unless I get myself on track (which I hope this week, I'll be able to) then I would have to work for 6 days a week.  Geez!  Get a life!  Oh last Saturday, instead of heading out to Chili's, Teza and I went to Fridays instead.  Rei, A, and Lod followed us there and we had a pretty interesting discussion about life, sex (or lack thereof), love, politics and money.  Lod, volunteered to pay using his credit card since he needed cash but after some heckling here and there, he decided to treat us instead.  (Poor Rei and A, they only ordered iced tea).  Darn!  Teza wanted to drink beer at that time.. should have ordered that beer!!!!  Darn!    Afterwards, we decided to watch Shrek but unfortunately, there was a long queue so scratch that plan.  I headed home after that.

      So it's Saturday now, 1024am and I'm still in the office.  Just passing the time away, waiting for Carlo and Teza.  We are going to Chili's to gorge on my favorite dessert - Molten Chocolate Cake.  This cake is sinful but simply divine.    Now what do I do this weekend?  There's a possibility of me doing overtime again later since I still have to finish 60 sessions.  So, I wish myself luck.    Yesterday, I wasn't able to attend my cousin's birthday party.  Too bad.  That's one of the hassles of working at night.. you miss the night parties held during weekdays.    And just wanted to make a note of my stupidity.  Jean and I went to M-Tech yesterday to have our annual physical exam.  I brought the pictures with me so I can look at it while waiting for them to call my name.  They were more efficient this year, however I made the stupid mistake of leaving the albums. So 20 minutes ago, I hailed a cab, went there just to get the albums.  Damage to myself - 45 pesos.    I need every peso... every peso counts.  I am as poor as a pauper.  Anybody here willing to donate some money to lil 'ol me?  I think not.  Hahah!

      Got back from Boracay last Tuesday.  Well my vacation was great.  Aside from the fact from being almost stranded there, I enjoyed it all 4 days.  We booked a flight from  urlLink Asian Spirit  for 6am.  We arrived in Caticlan at around 7am, from there we took a tricycle to the port.  I landed in the white sand beach of Boracay at around 8am.  Really fast trip mind you.  Unlike when you land in the Kalibo Airport, you'd still have to take a 2 hour bus ride.    Anyway, our place was located in Station 1, and we were able to locate it immediately.  I was supposed to name this blog entry as Almost Stranded in Paradise. But then again,  I changed my mind because, the place where we stayed at was called BORADISE (really funny name).  Actually the place was ok by my standards (for the not so finicky people, this place is a great place to stay in whenever you go to Bora) and it was really cheap.  2500 pesos per night!  Really good deal! The CR was clean, there's a TV with cable and the aircon is functioning pretty well.  Although there was a bit of a problem with the shower, I couldn't get it to work.  Only Leslie (my college friend) was the one who was able to make it work.    DAY 1 - May 15   For our first day, we decided to rest for a bit then go to Jonas.  I waited for a year just to taste their shakes.  Imagine, their shakes cost around 60 to 75 pesos and they use a pretty tall glass to boot.  I've noticed that they now allow people to take out their shakes (they place it inside a small bottle).  I actually planned to take out one shake so that I'd be able to sip a Mango Lemon shake on my way home.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do that because I was so full from my last breakfast meal.  Anyway, am jumping ahead of my story.  After having Jonas, we decided to walk all the way to Station 3 to check out the stuff that they were selling at the talipapa.  What's funny is, everytime we would see a nice place where absolutely need to have our pictures taken, we'd go and ask a total stranger to do it.  It's kinda lonely being left out of the picture so might as well ask another person to do it for you.  The walk to the talipapa was a long walk (I think, half of the time that we spent there in Bora was completely devoted to walking from one place to another).  We decided to swim for a couple of hours.  After which, we decided to check out this nice bar where they placed mats on the beach front.  Of course, I just absolutely had to have my beer and hotdog. For dinner, we went to Pier One.  The rest of the night we stayed in Cocomangas.  We ordered 3 shakers and mind you they were very yummy and deadly (if you don't watch it, you'll definitely get drunk).    Mae was stupid enough to leave her phone under the table where we previously sat, good thing, she realized that when we transferred to another table (that was say after 20 minutes).  After coming back from the restroom, she realized that her phone wasn't in her bag, she hurriedly went back to the place where we sat and thank god!  The phone was still there.   I wasn't all that drunk mind you.  Just the right kind of buzz.. I was actually laughing my head off because of Les and Yeth who were pretty much tipsy and saying all kinds of things.  (need not elaborate on that)   DAY 2 - May 16   Guess who called that morning when I woke up?  I actually had four missed calls from him.  Stupid ass!  Anyway, I didn't talk to him because I was pretty sleepy at that time.  It's been more than a month actually since I last talked to him.  So on with my story, we decided to go to Jonas again for brunch.  If you've noticed, we haven't been eating lunch actually.  After getting our fill of shakes and onion rings we decided to walk towards Fridays to have our pictures taken there. We also checked out SeaWind which offers this buffet for 450 pesos.  We wanted to try it but changed our minds the following night.  (Well, next time I go to to Bora, I'll be eating there definitely.)  That night, we ate at this place beside Gold Crowne (forgot the name).  The owner was nice, he even took our pictures.  After dinner, we decided to go to Hey Jude to have a round of beer.  Then it started to rain.  So anyway while drinking my beer, he called up again, so of course I had to go out of the bar because it was pretty noisy.  Really funny guy!  I thought I'd never hear from him again. Haha!  After Hey Jude, we went to Summer Place.  Then we saw that they had this Eat All You Can Mongolian thing.  So all plans to eat at Sea Wind were abandoned since this was considerably cheaper, 185 pesos.   After drinking several rounds of beer at the Summer Place, we went to Pier 1 to meet up with Aimee and her friends.  There weren't that too many people there because it was starting to drizzle at this time.    DAY 3 - May 17   I woke up because my phone was ringing.  I thought it was him but surprise surprise, it was my manager calling.  He called to say that there was a typhoon and when I looked out of the window... there was definitely a typhoon.  After dressing up, we decided to eat at Stables (which was right in front of our cottage).  Food was great but it was freezing cold at that time.  The owner was very nice and accommodating.  That night, we went to have our fill of Mongolian dinner.  I had two bowls, the second bowl was not that great.. made the mistake of pouring this sauce which turned to be very spicy.  After dinner and beer, we went back to the cottage, Leslie and Yeth were pretty tired at that time so Mae and I decided to meet Aimee near Cocomangas because it happened to be Cocomangas 17th anniversary.  (just had to add this, the two who stayed had a hard time sleeping because the night before, we've been regaling each other with ghost stories.. .hahahaha!)  After staying until 130am.. Mae asked me if I could wake up early so that we could check out the boat situation.  That day, they have cancelled all boat trips in and out of Boracay.   DAY 4 -  May 18   I was in a deep slumber when I felt someone poking me.  Mae woke me up at 545am.  Man, it's like I have been sleeping only for 3 hours.  I got up, got my sarong, wrapped myself around it and we decided to walk to the boat office or whatever you call it.  It was kinda eerie, that time.  There weren't that too many people, only the guards and the people cleaning the front of the resorts but that was it. I told Mae, that most probably the situation will improve that afternoon, so we just had to wait and see. We went back to the cottage and I slept until 10am.  I woke up due to the fact that my stomach was grumbling.  We never got the chance to eat at the Talipapa, however we did eat our fill again at Stables.  The pancake was absolutely sumptuous.   After breakfast, we decided to pack our bags and fix ourselves.  Though our flight was around 450pm... we didn't want to risk the fact that we might get stranded in Boracay.  We left Boracay at around 1pm.. and off we went to Caticlan.    I would say that although there was a typhoon, this is truly one of the best vacations that I've ever had.  With its white sand beach and pristine waters, I can't help but be awed.  Boracay always has that effect on me I guess.

      Well am heading to Boracay tomorrow.  My plane will leave at 6am.  Can't hardly wait!  I plan to get mercilessly drunk and I plan to burn myself under the sun.  It's going to be fun.    P.S. People have been making cracks about the plane that I will be taking.  It's called Asian Spirit (there were several reported plane crashes for this particular airline).  Anyway, they're saying that I'll be able to go to Boracay and I'll come back as a spirit.  Hahaha!  Yeah right!

      The title is inappropriate considering that my mother didn't desert us, but I couldn't think of another word to describe the current state of my family.  My mother already left for Canada (where she'll stay for a month) and afterwards will be going to the US to fix some stuff there.  I don't know when I'll be seeing her again but I hope soon (is a trip to America in the works here?)  Considering that I've been a bitch and a selfish ass for the past couple of days, all went well.  We brought her to the airport, we said our goodbyes.  I felt sad but no tears were shed on my end.    Her saying goodbye and going to the airport would have been the perfect melancholy end, however she just had to ruin it.   It became a comedy of errors of sort, which am glad for... lightened the mood a bit.  She left the money that she was to pay to the porter with my brother so she had to go back and wave and shout, I need the porter money... (she had already gotten rid of her peso bills and coins and just left the amount that she'll use to pay for the terminal fee).  So that was it...  The last view of my mom, was her waving at us.  Sad.. but it just has to be.

      I finished my damned fucking quota yesterady.  So here I am, in my house, resting.  I've had a good night's sleep, thank god!  And I am looking forward to another one.  So it's a Sunday today and it's quite windy.  Perfect bed weather.  I don't want to go out.    But they have this party going on in Grilla later.  The hot gays and Elaine will be treating us out for dinner.  Maybe I'll go, maybe I won't.

      So it's Wednesday and the sessions I've QA'd for the past two days, I can actually do it in a day.  That's how lazy I am.  Well not actually, considering the meetings (which I enjoy) and other stuff I do.  Oh yeah, crap!  Stop justifying it.  (does it seem like a schizo is writing this?)  Anyway my mom's definitely leaving on Tuesday.  We are going to have this dinner thing on Sunday.    Funny, there's this guy who wants to become a part of my list in Friendster. Eeeeeeeewwwww....  The food in my box is dwindling.. boo hoo! I don't have money left and I have resolved to stop borrowing money from people. From now on, that's it.  I need to learn how to manage my finances.  Oh by the way, a friend of mine broke up with her BF, I haven't heard the story yet.  But I guess, we saw it coming.  Another friend of mine is busy seeing her younger dude however she has told the guy that all she wants for now is "friendship".  Yeah right! Hahaha!  You will change your mind eventually.  Now the Dutch boy is back to visit my dear friend.  I sense that love is definitely in the air.  Now how come, it hasn't reached me yet?   Crap! My life is complicated as it is and I would love to make it more complicated. Hahahahahaa!!!!

      It's ironic, why do I have to write about my mother on Father's Day?  Anyway as it is, my parents are barely speaking to each other.  My mother is currently living with my cousin in Greenhills.  So there.  I think there was a time when I wasn't on speaking terms with her.  Wrote about that in a previous post but just in passing.  Anyway, it's kinda ok now but then I've built more walls around me that sometimes I know that she has a hard time getting through me.  Yes, yes, I am a bitch and a hard headed fool when it comes to my mother.  So, she finally got her visa for Canada and she's leaving on the 28th I think, or is it the 29th?  Sure I got sad, but then again, it's going to benefit everybody.  My dad (who can be an asshole sometimes) won't see her anymore.  My brother would have money for his tuition and my mother would get better (the weather in the northern part agrees with her).  So this arrangement would work well for us, I think.  I don't know when I'll see her again or if I'll still see her.  Hope everything works out though.

      I was late again for work for the nth time.  Gee. I already promised myself that I won't be late for work.  Thing is, the night before, I slept at around 7pm.  Good thing, somebody woke me up at 900pm.  So imagine that.   Nothing has been happening of late.  Boring.  I think am over my manic state of mind.  Good!  I really don't know why I felt that way for the past few days.  Remembering something, maybe.  Yeah, yeah, why do I have to lie?  Oh alright, I remembered something.  I cringe at the thought.  Anyway, I do not want to dwell on that anymore.  Probably on the 27th of July, I'll go ahead and write about it.  An anniversary thing. Hahah!  And let people read how stupid I was?  Naaah, I think not.   Met an interesting chap online, a guy from Mexico who's very nice if I may say and quite cute.    I am quite tired.  I want to go home.  P.S. 1 I wanted to give myself a pat on the back for reaching my daily quota yesterday.  P.S. 2 Now, I want to push myself for not being able to reach it.  P.S. 3 I think I am destined to work 6 days a week.. hell no.

      It's Monday again and the sun hasn't shown itself since Saturday I think.  Perfect bed weather.  I wish I could just stay in my bed, curled up with a blanket and a good book.  But then, reality sets in, and of course, I have to go to work.    I was supposed to go the company outing last Sunday but changed my mind.  Besides the fact that I have been awake for more than 24 hours, I wasn't feeling well.  I decided to hit the sack and sleep all day (or rather most of the day) long.  When I woke up, I was feeling all fresh and rejuvenated.  Met an interesting chap from Mexico while surfing the net, quite cute too if I may say.  Anyway, I think I'm feeling better now.  The past few weeks, I was on the verge of depression.  I actually don't know why, hormones probably.  I'll be posting two more poems here, but I think I left what I've written in the office.   I watched last Saturday the  urlLink Prisoner of Azkaban .  I didn't exactly hate it, but I felt that there could have been more.   I actually don't mind that he was not able to incorporate some things in the movie however, if you've never read the book, there will be some confusing details. Enough with that, I'm not much of a movie critic anyway.  I just wish that  urlLink J.K. Rowling  would finish Book 6 soon.

      I felt compelled to write again.  What’s happening is that people are having a sudden taste for opposites. My friends and I talked about this in Boracay and we actually teased each other to death about this.   Friend 1 , has always been attracted to older men and likewise.  Now, she finds herself caught in a situation that she wants to get out of.  The guy is 3 years her junior (which isn’t that much, if I may say) and he happens to be a probationary employee in her company.  Although, he’s not under her direct supervision, she’s in limbo.  I say go for it, girl.  If you like the guy, age doesn’t matter.  Well of course, office politics would come into question.  Good thing though, office romances are not prohibited in her place of work.     Friend 2  has this magnetic aura around her that drives married men to flock around her.  Of course, figuratively speaking.  They befriend her and she being her normal friendly self, accepts their offer of friendship.  She has never entered into a relationship with them, which I can vouch for.  There’s this guy (married, of course) who has been a constant companion for the past couple of months.  Her friends started to tease them before although they weren’t close that time.  They were the ones who kept on teasing the two and it has come full circle.  Now, they’re telling her to stay away from the guy since people are now starting to ask.  According to them, the guy doesn’t seem to be willing to work out his marriage anymore.  This is not the case though, the guy’s marriage was on the rocks right from the start, even before he met my friend.  Anyway, she took up psychology and she has been trying to help him out with his marital problems.  Purely platonic, I tell you.  No strings attached just pure friendship between two people who happens to be male and female.  Anyway, good thing, prior to this incident of tongue wagging, my friend had already decided to resign because she has found her true calling – as a teacher for children with disabilities.  We now tease her that since the world is changing; single men will now flock around her. Good!   Friend 3  has always been attracted to different kinds of men (in terms of looks) but they have a common denominator, I tell you. They are all assholes.  She now finds herself attracted to Ernie.  But I’d say that Ernie is more entranced with her. This is a good thing, since Ernie seems to be a nice guy and has a stable mind (Unlike Asshole 1, who was ok-looking but had the haircut very much similar to a certain mayor we all know that has really bad hair.  Remember that massacre thing before?).  I actually felt that Ernie liked her when we first met him.  At the time, however, she was dating Asshole 2 and my friends were constantly teasing us to death (example: A friend of mine told him straight to his face – “She likes you!!! – Ugh! I wanted to crawl under the earth that time).   I admit of course, that I had a crush on Ernie.  But then again, it was just a crush.  I’ve been egging Friend 3 ever since that Ernie liked her.  My intuition has never failed me (except of course when I’m under the influence of alcohol thus my senses are kind of hazy but that is another entry).  Now, Ernie (who’s leaving this week) is asking her to tour the world with him (Think: African Safari, European backpacking).  Totally romantic and I am happy for my friend.  Ernie came at the right time, because he diverted her attention from Asshole 2.  So as it is, she has met a wonderful guy and I hope that her streak for becoming attached to assholes would finally end.    Now where does that leave me?  I ask myself.    I’ve made a previous entry pertaining to the men I’m attracted to.  Just as a short recap, I’ve always found myself attracted to older, married, intellectually stimulating (good communication skills, no speech defects), mestizo looking or gay men.  So, if the world is truly changing.  These are the possibilities that I see for myself in the near future.  - I’d end up with a younger man.  (This doesn’t matter at all, age was never a factor I considered)  - I’d end up with a single man (This is good of course; I don’t want to get involved with a married man.  However, this doesn’t seem to be happening – think doctor.)  - I’d end up with an illiterate man, who can’t construct a sentence, a man who doesn’t know what a subject-verb agreement is, who won’t be able to converse with me.  (I shudder at the thought)  - I’d end up with someone who lives in the mountains of Pampanga (Eeeer.. please dear god… no.)  - I’d end up with a true heterosexual.  (Very good, indeed)  My friends have been teasing me that I’ll end up with an Indio who is stupid and illiterate.  Oh dear, no, please… the thought gives me the creeps.

      Another day begins and my work is done here.  I didn't get to do that much stuff, since I feel that my head is about to explode. Monday night, I was productive, Tuesday night sucked.    I wasn't able to sleep that well and the stress is killing me or is going to kill me.  I've had my blood pressure checked, and it's a bit on the high side.  Aside from the fact that I don't do that much exercise and I smoke like a chimney, I feel like everything's being dumped on my shoulders.  It's a heavy burden to carry and I feel like my back's going to crack. But what can I do?  Absolutely nothing.  I just need to go on and face life with all it's glorious hurdles.  I would just like to make a quick note about last night when I was on my way to work.  I got this cab driver who was listening to this f*ckin religious station... yes yes, I know I am not religious (I think I am becoming an atheist), nevertheless, I could use something religious in my life once in a while.    Thing is, the people who were calling the guy were asking all of this crappy questions.  I'd rather write it in Tagalog so that the essence will not be removed.  There was this one guy who called...   May pwet po ba ang diyos?     That fucking question stumped me!  Like, instead of wasting your time wondering about such useless stuff, do something productive man.  And the guy, who was like the main show host (they call him Bro. E****) got a line from the bible.   Sa kaharian blah blah ay may luklukan ang diyos.  (i.e. since may luklukan, merong pinangluluklok)   Geez!!! Get outta here!  Another question raised...   Ano ang blood type ni Hesus?   Next please... hahhahahaahah!!!!  So although I was stuck in traffic, their fucking questions amused me to no end.  Seriously though, they were saying something negative about another religious sect.  It makes me wonder, if they truly believe what is said in the bible, then they shouldn't be saying negative things about other sects.    Sheesh...  I'm outta here.

      A year ago, I made this entry in my blog...  Have you ever been in a situation wherein you wished you never did something? Have you ever been in a situation wherein you wished you could just turn back time and undo what you did?  Have you ever been afraid to take the risk? Have you ever been afraid to tell the truth? Have you ever been afraid that you will lose a person because you told a big fat lie?  I am not actually good when it comes to remembering dates, but I remember that day clearly.  There was a coup d' etat ongoing in Makati and I was busy flirting madly with a person I haven't even met yet.    I've realized a lot of things over the past couple of months.  I am not the person that I was.  I would like to say, that I came out of that experience unscathed.  But, I would be lying to myself if I said that.  I learned a lot.. about myself, about life.    My fall into madness was not an easy one.  Getting out of it was harder.  I got buried under the web of lies and deceit, that I didn't know anymore if I would still be able to get out.   People never noticed, because I was (still am) good in keeping things to myself.  I would rather not talk about my problems.  If asked, I'd rather be evasive.  I prefer to write though.  However, during that time, I found solace in my college buddies along with alcohol and several packs of cigarettes.    Really pathetic.  I know.    I guess, I was blinded by all the sweet words but they all turned out to be a bunch of lies.  It is (and will always be) truly dangerous for me to fall, because whenever I do, I get consumed by the madness of everything.  And when it is time to let go, nobody can help me.. nobody but me.  It took me several months to get over everything.  I guess what helped was the fact that all of my unanswered questions during that time were given answers towards the end.    If you ask me, if I'd like to go through the same thing again.  Probably not.  I'll do it differently.  Handle it with more maturity.    And I go on....

      Sometimes I feel that someday I'll just crack.  There are so many things that's bothering me now (althought it's not that obvious) but you know I feel that sometimes am carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders.  So the other day, I went to a spa to buy the gift certificate for a friend of mine (that's Teza by the way).  Anyway, while I was checking out the packages, I came across this massage therapy that they have.   Spot Tension-Release Back Massage (25 min)    Carrying the weight of the (your) world on your shoulders?  Lighten-up and enjoy this seated massage as often as you wish.     I was in a hurry and 300 bucks didn't sound that much.  And yes for 25 minutes, I felt that all my worries were gone.  I walked out of  urlLink Suriya  feeling great about myself. Hmmm.. might as well go back there for the full body massage.  There are now thoughts going thru my head.  Being among my friends from the office, I've realized that I am now the person belonging to the lowest level.  Yes, they are all supervisors (some trainers) and the waiting is starting to kill me.  I know, I definitely don't want to apply to become an operations supervisor but sometimes, I have doubts.  I've been encouraged before and I still feel that the time isn't right.  So when will it be?  I want to become a QA Supervisor but then again, this position is only opened whenever there's a NEW client that would require quite a number of seats.    So I continue to wait.  I've set some goals for myself.  Next year, when that fucking bill I pay every end of the month is finished, then I am free to study and take my masters degree.  I've just recently thought about it.  No hurt in setting my goals right?

       Saturday   &nbsp;  Carlo im'ed me so that I could meet up with him, Mel and Zhai.&nbsp; We went to McDonald's.&nbsp; I actually didn't eat however since Zhai was nice enough to order fries for us, I happily munched on the fries.&nbsp; After that, I headed back to the office again.  &nbsp;  Then I received a text message.  &nbsp;  I was tempted to drink beer for breakfast.&nbsp; Ron and Odie texted me to go Dencio's because there were two bottles of beer waiting for me there.&nbsp; Hah!&nbsp; How could I pass that up?&nbsp; So off I went to go to Dencio's to meet up with Odie, Monique and Ron.&nbsp; We stayed there for an hour or so, coz Odie and I were planning to meet up with the rest of the folks for a movie.  &nbsp;  After Dencios, we met up with Paul and off we went to GB3.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had lunch at Cafe Bola.&nbsp; Of course, I ordered my favorite meal... chicken lolliballs with Avocado shake.&nbsp; Yum yum!!!  &nbsp;  A arrived, then Lod.&nbsp; After lunch, we went to Food Choices, so that A and the rest of the folks can satisfy their sweet cravings.&nbsp; We saw Rei, near the escalator.&nbsp; I wasn't supposed to order actually, but I couldn't help it... I ate a donut from Gonuts.  &nbsp;  Since we were not allowed to smoke there, we decided to go to Segafredo.&nbsp; Carlo&nbsp;followed us there.&nbsp; So of course we&nbsp;were burning our lungs out but since it was getting hot, we decided to go inside which was a good decision, since there was&nbsp;a cutie there (a cutie with a bulging crotch - haha!).&nbsp; Oh yeah, and a waiter who only looks good when he's looking sideways (I would call him a profile cutie.. hehe!)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Since&nbsp;most of us came from our shifts,&nbsp;we&nbsp;decided to call it a day at 5pm.&nbsp; However, Rei, Lod, Jean and&nbsp;I decided to watch the Prince &amp; Me.&nbsp; Good decision!&nbsp; I absolutely adore Luke Mably.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Check out the quiz I took.  &nbsp;   urlLink    &nbsp;  After the movie, I headed back home to get my good night's sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Sunday   &nbsp;  I woke up late and had lunch with my family.&nbsp; Since I had to go to the office, I left after lunch.&nbsp;&nbsp;I texted&nbsp;Lod so that we can go ahead and meet up with the office so that we can go to Eastwood for&nbsp;Kat's baby shower.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lod arrived, he was gushing about the shoes that he bought at Rockwell.&nbsp; Darn!&nbsp; There was a&nbsp;mall-wide sale!&nbsp;&nbsp;Too bad I missed that.&nbsp; Anyway, after&nbsp;finishing some of the things that he had to do, we left for&nbsp;Eastwood along with&nbsp;Josef.&nbsp; Jean just followed us there, since she was going to come from her house.  &nbsp;  Funny thing is, we were&nbsp;all dressed in black (Lod, Josef and I).&nbsp; People at the party were asking if we attended the funeral for&nbsp;Adonis.&nbsp; Anyway, it was quite a fun party.&nbsp;&nbsp;The contests were&nbsp;great especially the song challenge thing wherein the two groups had to come up with songs that contained the word baby in it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After the shower; Josef decided to go home so we three decided to watch a movie (again!).&nbsp; Odie arrived a couple of minutes before the movie started which was all good.&nbsp; We watched Mean Girls and of course I enjoyed it.&nbsp; It's quite funny and the guy there, Jonathan Bennett is a major hottie.  &nbsp;  Now, I have two new crushes.&nbsp; Hehehe!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Finally, the day every working individual awaits.. salary day.  Dang!  I got a lot.  Thing is, after the bills are paid, I'll be back to zero I think.  Haha. Shit. Life sucks.  Anyway, I wish my card would arrive so that I can shop till I drop.  Yeah right.  Dream on, girl.  You have to learn self-control.    Things are looking good despite all the problems.  Although, a former teammate of ours committed suicide.  We weren't that close, don't even know if he knows my name.  But then again, it's sad.  May his soul find the peace that he didn't get while he was alive.    I'm not here to rationalize what he did, but I believe, for people who commit suicide, it's a way out.  A way out of their problems, a way out of the doldrums that life usually brings... It may not be the best way, but I guess it is a solution.  I guess during one's moment of insanity, although brief, you come up with weird solutions.    Believe me.  I've been through that.

      Saturday was fun, we watched Spiderman and I enjoyed it immensely.  After the movie, we went to Grilla so that Lod could spend his gift certificate (he won during the summer outing that we had).  Unfortunately, when we arrived at the restaurant, it was still closed. So we had to wait (we were all hungry this time) for around 30 minutes.  Good thing, Zhai shared the a donut that she bought from GoNuts. The food that we ordered was fabulous, it was more than enough actually.  After eating, we decided to call it a day eeer night.  Sunday, I did nothing actually, just basically slept until noon.  I was zonked out for 15 hours.  The dead man's sleep as I like to call it.  I only woke up because they woke me up for lunch.  Hmph.  Mid-afternoon, I started to prepare for the Luau Party.  Of course, I didn't even have anything to wear that remotely resembles anything from Hawaii.  So I decided to just deviate from the theme and wear black (whatelse?!).    I arrived at the party to a grandiose round of applause.  Of course, I felt some imaginary knives flying towards me (thrown by reps who think I don't deserve to fail their QA.. tee hee hee!)  but of course, since I basically don't care what they think, I just ignored it.  Haha!  The party was fun, the hosts were good.  Kudos to Che who delivered some lines that were absolutely funny.  So if ever, she decides to resign as a supervisor, she could go ahead and have her own stand-up comedy show.  Hehe!  I was able to eat well.  The table I chose was where the supervisors were seating (well almost all of them) and the food, booze were all for free.  Didn't even have to get a stub.  Since I had to go back and work that night, I didn't dare consume more than my usual bottles of beer.  Two and a half bottles, not bad, not bad at all.  Mel, was quite drunk to say the least.  She had her moment and sang a groovy rendition of Like A Virgin.  I think, I should sing that song, not her.  Haha!  Carlo was his usual bitchy self, but I liked his top, his boobs eeer nipples were peeking out.  Sexy! Hahahha!!!  The party ended, and we decided to have coffee.  So where would you go on a Sunday night?  Just to be safe, we went to Whistlestop.  It was a laught trip, considering the people who were there, were all crazy and green.  After the coffee, sugar (sundae) and oil (fries) rush, I decided not to join them.  They went to Digi Cafe and I went back to the office to do what else?  More sessions.  And that folks was how my weekend was.  I am looking forward to another fun filled weekend.  Hmmmm... I don't even have money anymore.  Uh-oh...

      There were new changes recently implemented in our department.  The supervisors were the ones who used to give the feedback to a representative pertaining to a session we've qa'd.  The new director has placed an emphasis on feedback and monitoring.  Now, we have been tasked to give feedback to the reps on the floor. It's a positive change actually and I welcome the challenge.   So far, the representatives I have encountered have all been amiable.  I have yet to meet a representative like LC who had the gall to keep on insisting that he was right and that we were wrong.  The procedures set by the client are pretty stringent and you can't bend them.  Nevertheless, he has an attitude problem.  I really would like to QA him and give him feedback for that just to see how he would react.  Anyway, going back to the reps I've talked to, they all ask interesting questions.  Questions that vary from topics about the call, the client's procedures or tips on how to become a QA.  It has all been heartwarming to say the least.    On the hand, there is this new batch of reps that will be joining the team.  Since they sit behind me, they've heard me make distinct reactions (my evil laugh) and cutting remarks (?!!!?!!!!?#DDXW??? go fig).  Unfortunately for them, they'll be joining the team I'm handling.  I've tried to mend my evil ways (lessen my comments and just plain keep it to myself) but sometimes I can't help it.  Anyway, I can't help but think, everytime I'd give them feedback, they'd remember the times where they heard me cursing everytime someone would make a mistake.    All I can say is that I'm not perfect.

      I was thinking of writing about the changes that were made in the QA Department, anyway, I can write about that some other time... this is more interesting.  It all started with a picture that was circulated in our office of a guy wearing black bikini swim trunks.  So what's wrong with that?  Well he happened to save it in a public folder that's why.  A lot of people were able to see his picture.. without him knowing it.  (He eventually discovered it, and he threw a fit.. blaming his friend for spreading the pic.. heheh!  Funny thing is, it wasn't his friend who spread the picture.  I know the culprit!)  There was another girl, who displayed a picture of herself sitting on a chair.  That's normal right? Nope sirree!!!  The girl was naked behind the chair and the picture looked like a shot out of Playboy or Penthouse. Hahahah!!!    Now there was this guy who also displayed a picture of himself.  He was also sitting on a chair wearing this Hawaiaan print polo.  This is, it was open, and he had a lot of chest hairs.  The photo could have been used as a centerfold for a gay mag. Hahahah!!!  Anyway, there was nothing really bad about the three pictures.  Just three people wanting to show off their bodies.  This was last year.  Now for this year...  A girl borrowed a phone from her teammate.  So the person who owned the phone (a guy) went looking for the girl because it's been several minutes already.  Seeing the girl come out of the CR, he immediately went thru his phone and guess what he saw?  A picture of the girl's tut*tut.  What's a tut*tut you ask?  (VAGINA! PUSSY!  CUNT! HAHAHAHAHAH!!!)  The girl made the mistake of not checking the phone thoroughly.  She had the gall to send out the picture using the guy's phone to her boyfriend.  Absofuckinlutely kinky!!!!  You want to know what happened to the picture?  The guy out of his disgust immediately deleted it.   I thought that was the end of it... here's another one...  Another girl bought this device (detachable something, that can be connected to a pc).  As she was about to leave the office, the guard had to ask her to show her the permit.  Tsk..tsk..tsk.. she didn't have one.  So the guy had to call the boss and the boss gave a directive that the girl should have that device checked by someone.  So the someone, checked the device and went thru the files and guess what the someone saw.. topless pictures of the girl! Hahahah!!!!  Now, this is the winner...  There are rumors circulating about one of the guys here (where there's smoke, there's fire).  Anyway there was a girl who was able to talk with the guy. It all started out innocently. Pictures were sent.  First the face.  Then the guy's crotch (he was unzipping his fly I believe). And then.. him jerkin off. Hahahhaa!!! He got caught because of the purple stations.  Hahahahha!!! I am not making sense.   Just wanted to write about this for posterity's sake.  Now if you don't know who they are, don't ask me who they are coz I won't tell.

      I was on a roll earlier.. I was actually working earlier.  Then it hit me.  Laziness.  Once something distracts me... whoosh!  My momentum is gone, just like that.  So here I am, bloggin again. I've gone thru different blogs (added a few links under my favorite blogs)  Just wanted to make a note of this blog..  urlLink Chona in the City , absofuckinlutely hilarious.  The writer is a genius.  Hehehe!  I've been thinking about changing the title of my blog.  Might as well.  I mean, this is my blog right?  (now I sound like a total schizo)  My father's getting better (thank god!).  I think the anti-depression pills are working.  Must take some myself.  Hahahaha!!!  A hundred pesos per pill?  No thanks.  I am now in control of my emotions again.  Am not that stressed anymore, neither am I depressed.  But there is one thing that I know.. my life will always be an emotional see-saw.  Up and down, down and up.. till all hell breaks loose.   On a lighter side, yesterday, my brother was asking how to get to Intercon via the MRT.  He knows how to get there when he's driving a car but he doesn't know shit when he needs to commute.  Poor guy.  Tsk...tsk...tsk...  That's where we are different, I can get out of the house land in Makati (or any place) without a car, without having to take a cab (although when I have the money, I'd rather take a cab).  Anyway, he probably got there alive and kicking. Must have been an adventure for my dear brother.

      I finally finished reading the book I borrowed from Carlo,  urlLink Oryx and Crake .  The book was with me for a month and a half I think.  It took me a long time to finish it, not because it was not well-written, but because it didn't interest me that much.  Anyway, since am done with that book, I finally read the books that I purchased,  urlLink Neverwhere  and  urlLink 11 Minutes .  I enjoyed both books.   Well there's an ongoing sale at PowerBooks.  Hmmm... I don't have money to burn.  Anyway, I can always borrow.
