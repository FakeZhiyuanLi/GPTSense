      Well I started out very happy today. So bubbly and perky...then 4th hour came. I found out I got 9/20 on my test. 54% in the class. I cried. For the first time in school I cried. Megan and I think Maria saw me. I only cried for a bit. I don't like people seeing me cry. Then I went to 5th hour. Jenny made me cry again. This time Anthony Schuller saw me. I swear to God that kid thinks I'm so retarded. So yes My day at school was awful. I came home and went to Melissa (Malow) and Saras (Bemis) track meet. Malow won by one point. Mel you did really good. I'm proud of you. This Saturday I'm spending the night over the Scallys. Yay. Maybe I can do something with my friend's on friday night since I haven't been out in awhile. That would be fun. Well I can't really think of anything good right now... -White-e (Ask Maria and Chelsea)

      Life is getting better. Seraw has offered to help me with my math early Tuesday morning in the commons. THANK YOU KOOSHINATOR! You know I love you! Yesterday was David's birthday. Happy 15th dude! But yeah I got this major make or break your grade project in biology on the ecosystem. We have been learning this stuff since when...4th grade? Its getting old very fast. Yeah but I have it almost done. Today (Saturday) I had softball practice. We practiced slidding and I screwed up my knee real bad. I can't bend really far and I can't kneel. I hope it gets better soon. But yeah Mel came over today. She went to church with us and when we were saying the creed she put her hand on her heart. I was like dude this isn't the pledge. Good Lord she is a blonde but you gotta love her. I'm super bored. Nothing much to do around this house. All I want to come is June 9th. I'm not even looking forward to my birthday. Wow I'm a loser. Well I have nothing else to say so nighto kiddos.

      I'm sick of life. I'm sick of math. I'm sick of spanish. I'm sick of everything. I have no reason to live another day. My dreams of becoming an anesthiologist are shattered... I'm failing math now. You guys promise me you'll help me. But do you? No no one ever does. If I go in early to Mrs. Austin she teaches me whole new crap and I don't understand. I'm giving it my all to understand but its just so hard. Your probably wondering why I'm still here if I'm bitching...well some people actually make me feel like I should live. I thank God I have those people in my life everyday. Without friends I'd be dead. I don't think there was anything good about today at all. I hope tomorrow is better.

      Yahoo this years party kicked major butt! Thanks to all that came: David, Maria, Ashley Bass, Jessica,Larry Ashley Presser, Seraw,Chelsea, Megan,Lia, Sam and Kyle! It wouldn't have been a party without you guys! Well to start it off when Maria and I got home David was already there and he planned a scheme to soak little kids with squirt guns and water bombs! It worked till they found out that they were throwing it through my sister's window...I swear they are little devils. But yeah then I had to make popcorn and everyone helped with the popcorn pools. We went swimming too. I had to lend Sam my Ford boxers to sleep cause hes a loser and didn't bring a bathing suit. It was funny. They hit me with noodles and I gave a lot of people rides on my back. Then it stormed and it was cool but scary at the same time cause there was a huge cloud swirling above our heads and we had to take down 3 tents. Maria flew back cause the wind was so hard. A pole ramned into my knee but its ok, I lived.Then Chelsea, Megan, Kyle, Jessica, Ashley Bass had left. We went in my room and had a little fun in bed, if ya know what I mean. I'm not going into detail about that. Haha it was fun though. Seraw had a fasination with this vibrating square...lmao. Don't ask. Well I'm out!

      This weekend was good. On Saturday I cleaned out the garage for the End of The Year Party. Also I spent the night at the Scally's. So did Mike Hathaway. Melissa and me went shopping and I got more clothes. Later that night I played Poker, Egyptain Ratscrew and Go fish with Matt and Mike. They are so funny when they bitch at eachother. I should film it sometime. They are always at eachothers throats....I'd like to know how they have stayed friends with eachother for so long cause they fight all the time. Well on Sunday I helped open the pool. I had to clean the pool benches with Soft Scrub and a scrub brush...oh yes so much fun. Suprisingly the pool is clear with sand at the bottom which means it should be ready (hopefully) by Wednesday. Yeah the party should be fun. I also got a voicemail from Tyler today! I haven't talked to him in like a month and he wanted to know how I was doing and how Michigan was. Well etleast someone cares about me! Ha that voicemail made my day. No guys I'm not crushing on Tyler, we are just good friends who have a boatload of stuff in common.
