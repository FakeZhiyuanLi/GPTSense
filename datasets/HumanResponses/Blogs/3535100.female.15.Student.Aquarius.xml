      Hey...        yeah the past 2 days have not been the best...thursday night Tim went to Dave thats kool and all no problems! He was spose to call me when he got home i didnt care wut time it was...((tear tear)) didnt happen. Friday i tried to get ahold of him all day, and his lil sis taylor told me he wasnt home and that she would have him call me. well he would not answer his cell so finally around 7:30 i gave up on calling him. mom dad lyndsey n missy went to the race track and i stayed home alone till like midnight. i woke up this morning and called tims house at like 12:30...got to talk to Theresa! ((*his mommy*)) she said that we (my family) could go to the park with them and eat KFC if we wanted...i wanna go but it would be a little weird without tim there so idk yet. the rents r going to quaker steak and lube sometime soon theyre on their way home. still havnt talked to tim, but i mean someone knows something and juss isnt telling me. its kinda upsetting. but yeah idk wut im doign tonight so call my cell if you wanna chill or sumthin. but for now im gone i need to go eat, or go on a walk idk ill write tomorrow!  --Tim I LOVE YOU--   ********SyDnEy ...

      "Baby, Now That I've Found You"  Baby, now that I've found you I won't let you go I built my world around you I need you so, baby even though You don't need me now  Baby, now that I've found you I won't let you go I built my world around you I need you so Baby even though You don't need me, You don't need me oh, no  Baby, baby, when first we met I knew in this heart of mine  That you were someone I couldn't forget. I said right, and abide my time  Spent my life looking for that somebody to make me feel like new Now you tell me that you want to leave me But darling, I just can't let you  [guitar & fiddle solo]  Baby, baby, when first we met I knew in this heart of mine That you were someone I couldn't forget. I said right, and abide my time  Spent my life looking for that somebody to make me feel like new Now you tell me that you want to leave me But darling, I just can't let you  Now that I found you I built my world around you  I need you so, baby even though You don't need me now  Baby, now that I've found you I won't let you go I built my world around you I need you so Baby even though You don't need me You don't need me no, no   "When you say nothing at all"  It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart Without saying a word you can light up the dark Try as I may I could never explain What I hear when you don't say a thing  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall You say it best when you say nothing at all  All day long I can hear people talking out loud But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd Old Mr. Webster could never define What's being said between your heart and mine  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall You say it best when you say nothing at all  The smile on your face lets me know that you need me There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall You say it best when you say nothing at all.   "Looking In The Eyes Of Love"  I wonder should I tell you `bout all the crazy things I've ever done I've been searching all my life And when I should have stayed I tried to run I was searching for an answer In a world full of strangers But what I found was never real enough Now that I've found you I'm looking in the eyes of love  Darlin' you've been good to me You are so much more than I deserve I never thought that I would find Someone who's so sweet and kind like you Please believe me when I say This time I won't run away I swear by all of heaven's stars above Now that I've found you I'm looking in the eyes of love  [Chorus:] Looking in the eyes of love I can see forever I can see you and me walking in this old world together Lord my heart's found a home I've been dreaming of Now that I've found you I'm looking in the eyes of love  [Chorus]   "I'll Be"  The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful Stop me and steal my breath Emeralds from mountains thrust toward the sky Never revealing their depth Tell me that we belong together Dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated I'll hang from your lips Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above  [Chorus:] I'll be your crying shoulder I'll be love suicide I'll be better when I'm older I'll be the greatest fan of your life  Rain falls angry on the tin roof As we lie awake in my bed You're my survival, you're my living proof My love is alive not dead Tell me that we belong together Dress it up with the trappings of love I'll be captivated I'll hang from your lips Instead of the gallows of heartache, that hang from above  [Repeat Chorus]  I've been dropped out, burned up, fought my way back from the dead Tuned in, turned on, Remembered the things that you said  [Repeat Chorus]

I rode with Tim so he wouldn't have to drive alone or w/e...and Lisa 'n' Chels left before us even though they didnt know where Matt lives and me n Tim were sitting in his driveway bout to pull away when Lisa comes back and says my mom said I need to go home cause she saw Lisa and Chels without me...EeK! So we go to my houe and I explain everything to my mom so Im not in trouble ne more..then we leave to go to Matts and we took the back way. We get to Longrifle and Tim juss starts getting away from her and Lisa n Chels end up fuckin lost as hell! So Tims fone is dead Lisa n Chels went back to Westerville to find Eric and Travis and come to find out theyre on Campus. So we meet up with Lisa and Chelsea FINALLY! and we all go back to Matts crib for a lil bit. We get bored so we leave and meet them at the Duke like 20 minutes later...I fought with Tim over the keys for like 15 minutes outside lol I lost cause I wanted shotgun again lol Matts ass sat in the back!...haha jp jp u kno i luv ya matt! HAHA! So we get to the Duke and Tim gets gas then we sit there and wait for Lisa and Chelsea forever and then they get gas, and I get out of the car the happiest gurl alive...we went to campus to try and find travis and eric but by the time we got there we had to turn around and go home cuz my mom was being gay and made me be home by 11...GRR! but I was still like int eh best mood ever! So that was like the best night in a long ass time with the most amzingly funny ass people when we're all together!!  &nbsp;  I'll write soon....Its amzing how one night with someone you know your in LOVE with can make you so amazingly happy that nothing can bring you down!

So i go back to the motorhome, and sat down and thought&nbsp;I was oka and get up to get Lyndsey her present from me and fall, and staret bawling cause my right side was killing me...mom started freakin out saying if it kept uip we would have to leave even though we didnt have ne insurance cards ((*cuz dad switched jobs*)) so i take like 4 pills and its oka not gone, but a little better. Today was the fun race Lyndsey went out 2nd round.&nbsp;then i go to bed!     &nbsp;   *Thursday*-HmM...test n tune was today I think.

LOL! But anyways they had a barbeque dinner tonight...even though it was hamburgers hot dogs corn chips and pop haha...got back to the motorhome talked to dad n Bobby outside for quite a while then went inside n took a shower, then back out to talk and then to bed...the guys kept driving by n waving at me! haha dad told me to go inside! lol!     &nbsp;   *Saturday*-Lyndsey lost 2nd round today, but a lot of people did cause the weather kept changing. she red lit meaning she left the line too early cause her car was pullingf ((*dad put the idle and RPM's too high*)) so we put the stuff in the trailor and went to the stands to cheer on everyone else who was still in! WE GOT THE MOST SPIRITED TEAM AWARD!!! WOOO&nbsp;HOO!!!&nbsp;LOL! Alyssas mom 'n' my dad were the most spirited parents out there&nbsp;I think, but never again will they cheer like they did!! LOL!
