      I was shocked when I stumbled onto  urlLink Martin Roth's  page on global Christianity.  His page on Korea was a complete wake-up call to what I was completely oblivious to.  (being the US college student that i am)  I have realized that there is clear and rampant martyrdom going on now as i type in NORTH KOREA.  It angers me, shocks me, and saddens me to know that those of my homeland are being totured, killed, and worked to death for what i so take for granted.  ( i REALLY took it for granted this summer.)  i have the blessed right to proclaim my devotion to the Christian faith and not be persecuted for it, as a U.S. citzen. (I was born here)  here's a link to the  urlLink Chosun Journal .  Written by a Korean-American law student, he writes editorials and articles about the atrocities that are being made in North Korea--it is being compared to the Holocaust, and frankly, I'm starting to agree with him. Read the website, and you'll see what i mean.  Here is an official article by Christianity Today, about an eyewitness account of the Christian   urlLink CONCENTRATION CAMPS  in North Korea.  Here's a speech made by  urlLink General Pil Sup Lee --former Joint Chief of Staff for South Korea.  He is now the president of the Association of Military Christian Fellowships, and this speech is eloquent, yet clear about how he has become a participant in a  new program that will help bring Christianity to the conscripts of the South Korean Army.  (every young male has to give military service for at least 2 years--it's mandatory).  It has brought positive results--less suicides, less leaves-of-absences without tangible reasons, and so forth.  WHERE HAVE I BEEN?    Let's all pray for the ones who are suffering monstrocities in Korea, for believing in a God, that I have taken for granted.

      For those of you who frequent the site, but only give quick glances, and do not realize small, yet significant changes and developments:  1) New Pages!!! -  urlLink "About Me" :  I have already posted a very short bio (i am only 21 yrs old), and a short list of miscellaneous facts and factoids -  urlLink "Downloads" : I will post at least one song a week, along with various groups of interesting photos.  these are all provided for the    reader to obtain through copy, save as, download - urlLink "A Religious Review" : reviews of music, celebrities, books, films, and anything else of great common interest.  the occasional political, social, and/or religious issue will spring up.  plus, all opinions are based on my religion--Christianity!!!  2) Comments feature: at the end of each post, even on the "additional pages", there is a link to a comment box.  feel free to add your opinions, suggestions, and thoughts.  however, as the "moderator" of this website overall, i will edit out any profane or rude content.  feel free to disagree--just do so in language your granny wouldn't scream in horror hearing you say or write.  3) Look out for new links that are added!  i add those of great quality and personal interest.  4) check out the link for  urlLink "blogs4god" .  i'm not the only Christian writing about what's of interest to me personally, with the religion of Christianity being at the focus of their life.   - Enjoy!  hopefully, by the end of the week, all pages will be formatted, organized, and filled enough for my own personal satisfaction.   to explain this need for perfection you should read:  urlLink Tues. Oct. 29: online quiz results   "Whose Your Favorite Friend?"    i ended up being monica.  explain anything?

       urlLink Which Lord of the Rings character would you be?   can you believe it?  An online quiz that tells you which character you most likely identify with.  If I were a character in   The Lord of the Rings  , I would be Eowyn, Woman of Rohan, niece of King Theoden and sister of Eomer.  Great...one of the minor female roles.  in the book, she's awesome with disguise and showing strength and passion....but why i couldn't have been Arwen?

       Who's Your Favorite "Friend"?       Monica   Mon! You're the normal one, honey, in the best way possible. You're caring, you're responsible, you look to the future—what a gem. Wait a second, did you just start editing for grammar mistakes in the middle of reading your own compliments? Ok, so you like things, well, the way you like them. But even when you're smiling through clenched teeth, waiting for everyone else to get with the program, deep down, you're really still smiling. You're just waiting for that impatient moment to pass.   When it comes right down to it, you are thoughtful, meticulous, and good at what you do. As for romance, you can be a little picky and want things to be just-so. We wouldn't expect anything less. And like the original Monica, if you can avoid rushing into things, you'll find the right match and all the happiness your sweet, finicky, heart deserves.      Julie, your movie star double is Cate Blanchett !!!   An intellectual like you needs to be played by someone who understands how to be deep without being boring, someone who can grasp complicated subjects and make them seem clear cut, someone like Cate Blanchett. Whether bringing to life Elizabethan stories or playing an undercover WWII courier in Charlotte Gray, Cate has shown the world that being smart can be sexy.   Julie, you're a Critic!    Your personality is actually determined by two personality sub-types — your primary, or dominant sub-type, and your secondary sub-type. You are a Critic which means you are a Thinker / Success. Your primary sub-type is defined by "Thinker" characteristics and your secondary sub-type is defined by "Success" characteristics.   That means you're complex, thoughtful and never content to skate on the surface. Chances are you veer towards being so analytical and introspective that even positive qualities can seem like faults. The truth is that you have a very perceptive, gentle spirit.  How do we know all this? How do we know that you hate chaos at work and prefer a structured environment? Or that sometimes you feel undervalued by your boss? How could we have divined that there's a part deep inside you that's aching to make more money?  Because while you were taking the test, you answered four different types of questions — questions that measured confidence, apprehension, willingness to take risks, and your focus on experience versus appearance — the primary traits that determine your personality. Based on your responses, we determined your personality type, Critic.    urlLink Emode.Com

      I was quite happy on Monday afternoon, because I had turned in my first paper/midterm.  I had completed one of four lovely midterms.  now, i am taking a short break (one of many) from studying for two....i have two tomorrow.  one to take....one to turn in.  aargh.  bleh.  eck.  yuck. just plain yucky.  anyone want to help me cram info about national security? (basically all the problems our past presidents had w/ other countries...and how they solved them...quite educational!)  or anyone want to help me write a short paper on revolutionary war political thoughts and theories?  help...please?   (hee hee).  i will add more interesting info later. i promise.

      ok, i lied.  i guess i like to add stuff whenever i can.  i am at the library right now, and i am feeling pretty good, considering the lack of sleep that i got last night.    the lovely lit paper (=midterm) that i had to write was finally completed at....oh, 6:30 am.   those of you who know me...one word--procrastination.  i am such a stinker...it makes me look i've cheated when i end up doing ok...cuz there's the select few who actually have spent more than one day on the same papers.  Anywho, i also feel pretty good about myself, cuz i finished reading 30 pages of a slavery narrative--not because of the effects of the story, but because i started catching up on the mountain-like load of reading i have to do for ALL of my classes.  (it really was bad down there in the south then.  it kinda actually gets me mad.)  so i feel like i'm actually getting stuff done for once.    plus, i had rubio's for lunch, and i lo-ove mexican food.  what more could i want?   oh yeah.  i kinda wanted to get a journal typed up for my next class.  i guess it's not going to happen, since it's starting in 20 minutes, and i'm still here at the library typing away.   oh well.  so much has gone on this weekend, while i was in my little room sitting and pretending to work on my colonial american literature paper.  first, a democratic senator that was in the running for the upcoming elections in Minnesota died in a plane crash. Click here to see who they've decided to replace him with:  urlLink "Mondale likely to replace Wellstone"   then, there's this whole controversy about how the Russian military tactics appeased a hostage situation.  could the gas that was used by the military be the main reason for so many of the hostages' deaths? here's the latest: urlLink "Kremlin stays mum on lethal gas"   finally, here's a story about a shootout at an Arizona college.  click here:  urlLink "Four die in Arizona college shooting"   i'm feeling better, but is everyone else?  something to think about, as we all realize the reality of this weekend's current events.  i'll be back.

      I asked God for strength, that I might achieve,  I was made weak, that I might learn humbly to obey.  I asked for health, that I might do greater things,  I was given infirmity, that I may do better things.  I asked for riches, that I might be happy,  I was given poverty, that I might be wise.  I asked for power, that I might have the praise of men,  I was given weakness, that I might feel the need of GOD  I asked for all things, that I might enjoy life,  I was given life, that I may enjoy all things.  I got nothing I asked for-  But everything I hoped for.  Almost despite myself, my  unspoken prayers were answered.  I am, among all men,   most richly blessed…..

      The beach.               A bubble bath. 		 Hugging the person you love.	 Laughing so hard your face hurts. 	 Friends.	 Watching the sunrise. A hot shower. 		 A long distance phone call.	 Finding presents under the Christmas tree while drinking eggnog. 		 A good conversation. 	             Getting mail.	 Song lyrics printed inside your new CD so you can sing along. Taking a drive on a scenic road.		 Laughing at yourself. 	 Chocolate milkshake. Lying in bed listening to the rain outside.	 Running through sprinklers.	 Making chocolate chip cookies!		 Laughing for absolutely no reason at all.	              Hot towels out of the dryer. Finding the sweater you want is on sale for half price.           Having someone tell you you're beautiful. Laughing at an inside joke. Getting out of bed every morning and thanking God for a beautiful day.

      GUESS WHAT?!?!  I have figured out that i can store music files on here too.    Here's the link:  urlLink MercyMe - I Can Only Imagine   Just right click on it, and go to "Save As"...and then you can put the file in whichever folder you want.  If any of you have trouble with it, email me or leave a comment.   This is the song that has brought me inspiration for this wonderful site!!!!!!!!    (NOTE:  If i get in trouble for having an mp3 tho, i might not be able to leave this on here.  enjoy it while you can!! )

      hmmph.  i do not have something off the top of my head to share that's going to change the world....  may i just share with you all about how i actually enjoy speaking with my brother?   it's so ironic--if you had seen the two of us in the same room a year ago, that in itself would have been a jaw-dropper in itself.    not because it was such an infrequent event, but because we were so-o different from each other.  i am not kidding--i used to experience various friends of my younger brother express a considerable amount of surprise.  " You're  Brian Row's older sis--ter?!?!"  (gee...i need to think about that one.  that might be too hard to answer, considering how my room is just down the hall, and you're the one that's the visitor...and also due to the fact that we both share the same last name!!!)  I was the nerdy, quiet, and reserved honor roll student who stayed home to study, watch TV, and had the occasional friend come over.  He was the wild, outgoing, goofy teen who made friends quickly--people actually could connect his name to his face!!!  There's more to our differences...but, i don't want to risk a possible disowning (from my bro--for revealing a little too much!)  However, as I have mentioned, he has become a sincere and new Christian, and sharing that common faith, has made all the difference in the world.  We share feelings, jokes, dreams, goals, and sympathy. (We have parents we love dearly, but who we seem to have trouble understanding....it's a difference in culture.)  We both were born and raised here in the U.S., and have grown up with parents who worked too much....as Korean immigrants who wanted something more than their own homeland could offer--a chance at the ever-famous American Dream.  For my parents, it was economic stabilitiy, honor through a prestigious career, and security through a well-rounded life and loving family.  For my brother and I....can I say that it's clearly a different story?  For me personally, my ultimate dream is to live a life here on Earth, that would best exemplfy God's vision for me as Julie Row.  I am having a great "conversation" with myself over what I should be doing after my education is done and out of the way.  I want to be so confident about His presence and His power, that doubt is something that comes less frequently than it does now... (presently, it comes oh....every other minute!!!!)  And that in itself, will bring stability, honor, security, and love.  Whaddya think?  No $$$....no great job...unless it's what God wants for me.  (I get the feeling it isn't.)    I'm spending too much time on the phone (long-distance, mind you!) with him.  He has much to say too.  We haven't seen each other in awhile.  It's time to catch up.     moving on, i have been visiting another blog every now and then.  it is quite interesting--the author is a self-proclaimed homeless who lives in Nashville, TN.  It's titled,  urlLink The Homeless Guy .  He never really clarifies whether he is a Christian or not.  But, his reasoning comes close to the possiblity of him being one...and he's actually  quite intelligent and enjoys building a website like myself, if not even more.  You guys should at least look at this blog once.   I know that our server has acknowledged him.  He's become quite famous actually.  Anyone interested?

      guess what?    i thought there were only a select few out there who focused their blogs (short for web-log) on their lives as Christians.  boy, was i wrong.  i went to this great site called  urlLink  blogs4god  , and i searched through the site, they have so many listed, who are doing something similar to what i'm doing.  anyone interested in hearing how christian college students in foreign countries are thinking?  they have blogs that are so awesome!    there's one example of one here in the U.S. -- urlLink Josh Claybourn .  His website is the one that's visited the most. He's got an interesting story of how someone supposedly found James's  (bro of Jesus) burial box--here's the  urlLink official article .     Anyone interested in learning how they're currently verifying Jesus was truly alive?   if you look there are two new links to these great groups that list participating bloggers of proclaimed Christian faith.  There's another group called  urlLink Christian Bloggers  (along with  urlLink  blogs4god  ).  check them both out...there's so many great Chrisitan blogs.    i am awaiting approval for both groups...so i can be included.  they just need to verify that i'm christian.  i think i'm a believer---how bout u? ;)  take a peek at whatever site interests you!!! yay!!!

      okay, as i scan my prior entries...i realize why that one night i was feeling so confused.     i was receiving what is known as a "spriitual attack".    i was too chicken to talk about it during small group (Bible Study) tonight.  I was feeling kinda low.  I think it hit emotionally, and a little physically, cuz I was so tired.  I had just woken up from a nap when I went.  To be honest though, I knew going to the Bible study was going to help me feel better, and it did.  yay!  (why do i always feel better writing about it...and not talking about it? i'm sharing certain close details online...but not in person.)   It feels like someone (whether it be God or not)  knows that i am gradually becoming more spiritually involved and active in the Christian faith, and either wants to test me or discourage me from being in a position in my life where i can be at peace.  seriously, when i am strong and confident in my Christian faith, i feel so assured and calm--God is in control!    any of you Christian music fans know Twila Paris?  she has a great song titled, "God is in Control".     as i keep on going with the topic of Christian music, there's also another group called  urlLink Mary Mary , that is great--awesome hip-hop style.  Here's their new hit single called "Incredible", from their new album with the same title.    I can't believe you chose someone like me When I've done nothing to deserve it....no.... I feel so blessed cause you give me your best Your love is nothing less than...incredible   I'll take a little time out Just to think a little while Back on everything I've been through All my ups 'n' downs Would still be ups 'n' downs if  If it wasn't for you  I tried it without you Can't do it without you Never again will I try You came and you loved me and oh how you loved me Somehow I just don't know why  Lord you mean just The whole world to me Without you I don't know Where I would be   Here's their ulitmate famous hit, called "Shackles (Praise You)".  I know there's at least several people who know this song and like it...even though you know it by tune and not by title.  Enjoy the lyrics!   Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance I just wanna praise Ya, just wanna praise You You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands And I'm gonna praise Ya, I'm gonna praise You   In the corner of my mind I just can't seem to find A reason to believe that I can break free,  'cause You see I have been bound for so long it feels Like all hope is gone, but as I lift my hands I understand That I should praise You through my circumstance  Everything that could go wrong all went wrong At one time, so much pressure fell on me,  I thought I was gonna lose my mind,  Lord I know You wanna see If I will hold on through these trials, but I need You To lift this load 'cause I can't take it no more  Been through the fire and the rain, Bound in every kind of way, But God has broken every chain, So let me go right now

      i just finished watching my recording of 7th heaven and everwood.  those two shows, along with gilmore girls and smallville, are the only ones i will bother watching.  like i'll actually record them if i think i'm going to miss watching them initally.  i'm such a  urlLink "WB"  fanatic!!!      post-graduation activities have been on my mind lately, can y'all tell?    (refer to last entry)  i guess i can say that i am concerned.  especially if i feel like an all-poweful deity is asking me to consider full-time dedication.   one last thing b4 i finally go to sleep.  the links to the left are those that i enjoy going to alot.    the first section is my email address  and a link to my AIM screenname.  if i end up getting spam for both, i'm going to have to take care of it accordingly.  did you know that people can send you "spam" IMs too?  i've gotten ones b4 that were really bad.  the second section includes those that deal with my personal health condition that i deal with daily, my school, and two very great christian fellowships.  the third section are those of my current fav music group, my fav movie, and my fav film critic.  i have yet to add links to books, and anything else that would pertain anything of great interest to me.  the last section is two other personal websites--the first one is about an American female's experience in Korea, and now her experiences visiting friends and family all over the U.S.  She's the kind of the writer that really captures your attention.  the next site is my close friend from high school--she has the potential to hit it big in the show business.  i'm always praying for her.  feel free to look at these sites.  that's what they're there for.  have any suggestions as to how to better my links or my site?  feel free to comment.  just click on the links at the bottom of each entry.  good night!

      i am confused.  but i know that it is not because i am feeling sorry for myself.  something special's about to happen.  read on to see my complicated explanation.  part of me wants me to feel really frustrated.  lately, i've been feeling really alone.  maybe there's a reason for this--i'll explain later.  part of me is very happy--God has finally answered my prayers concerning my younger brother!!!  i've been spending alot of time with him over the phone,  talking  to him.  we never did that before.  we were always in such different worlds and circumstances.  But, now we both share the common faith and bond in Christianity.  i love him so much, and the one thing i wanted him to do--which was for him to  willingly  become a Christian, has finally happened.  He confirmed it last night. (sorry, Brian if I'm embarassing you or mentioning too much. let me know--i can always edit things out).  I am so proud of him.  part of me is actually confused.  i have no clue what to do after i graduate from college.  everything is so hazy and fuzzy right now.  (sigh.)  why am i feeling alone?  cuz, i can honestly say that i have no friend at this moment that i can comfortably share  everything  with.  i can't confide in anyone without holding at least one thing back.  i'm always afraid of what that person's going to think.  and, i really feel like because my friends have their own lives and their own things to do, that i need to really stop expecting them to drop everything to listen to me.  plus, i cannot name one single human as a best friend.  i have various friends who don't mind seeing me from time to time.  yet, as i read 2 Timothy 4:16-18...it became clear to me why i was feeling this way, and why i was seeing everything this way.  "At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me.  May it not be held against them.  But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it.  And I was delivered from the lion's mouth.  The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom.  To him be the glory for every and ever. Amen."   why does this passage relate to me?  remember how i mentioned how i felt confused about my future?  he's already dropped a couple of clues.  but, as for clear links, actual visions....nothing.  i still need more specific details.  i get the feeling that i'm not going to law school for prestige and honor.  if i am to ever go to graduate school, or anything after undergrad... i am going to go prepare for a unique purpose.  have i told any of you?  i get the notion that God is telling me to dedicate my life and my future for his glory alone.  That means anything from church involvement to missions work.  Who was I talking to last week about my trip to a Navajo reservation ?  oh yeah--it was Olivia.  anyways, some of you know this already, but i really did enjoy going.  i have never felt more at peace or at ease with the people around me.  and, for those of you who know me well, it is clear that i am an overanxious, nervous, paranoid and insecure person.  so...here's a brief outline.  feeling alone--increased need for God.  need for God--closeness with God---preparation for what's in store for my future (spritually and through further study)  Future---possible full time dedication to evangelism...missions....?    Let me just say this--today at the Graduate School Fair on campus, the tables and representatives I visited were those who dealt with public policy/social welfare programs.  And the possiblity to work with non-profit organizations after gaining a master's degree has been brought to my attention.  One school even had public administration as their focus--heading up an organization or creating one as being a future career possibility for this program.  Can God be giving me subtle hints?

      Can anyone else be more addicted to the internet than I have been these past two days?  arrgh.  Seriously, the little bright post-it that i had, with all my reading assignments has been clearly neglected.  bad julie.  ever since i decided to start this webpage, update my photo collection (does  urlLink Webshots  ring a bell?), and on top of all that, make both my webpage and photo collection top-of-the-line...i have sat in front of the computer.  i have no life.  i'm seriously laughing at myself.  guess what?  i've been listening to MercyMe over and over again, even though across the room, i have over 80 CDs to choose from.  time to move on.

      So, how's the title of my website, I Can Only Imagine?  The source of inspiration is from a song with the same title.  The group is called MercyMe--a new Christian group that focuses on praise music.  It was love at first hearing.     I can only imagine what it will be like When I walk by your side I can only imagine what my eyes will see When your face is before me I can only imagine   Surrounded by your glory What will my heart feel Will I dance for you, Jesus Or in awe of you be still Will I stand in your presence Or to my knees will I fall Will I sing hallelujah Will I be able to speak at all I can only imagine I can only imagine   I can only imagine when that day comes And I find myself standing in the Son I can only imagine when all I will do is forever, forever, worship you I can only imagine I can only imagine  I can only imagine When all I will do is forever, forever worship you I can only imagine

      Hello all!  I've decided to post a very quick summary of my life so far.  I know that I can honestly say that it is not fantastic or fascinating, but I am special, unique, and there's no one else out there that's like me!  So enjoy! (smile)  I was born near the neighborhood of Koreatown in Los Angeles, California on March 2, 1981.  I was the first child as well as the first daughter in my family.  I grew up as a young girl in Los Angeles while attending preschool.  Then, my family and I moved to a southeastern suburb of Los Angeles county called, Downey.  It was here that I would attend school for the grades of kindergarten through 12th.  Below, you can see which schools I attended.  I did what I could so that I would be accepted into a decent university, and I eventually was able to attend UC San Diego, pursuing a major in political science.  I didn't realize until my junior and senior years that literature may have been a possible major, perhaps even better for myself than political science--yet, I ended up pursuing a minor instead because of time, etc.  I have now graduated, and I am also now in the process of spending time deciding what is best for my future and career. Wish me luck!  (Update as of 6/25/04) For now, I have already worked in three law firms after college graduation.  So, since the summer of 2003, I have worked in a criminal law firm, a personal injury law firm, and finally, I worked for an immigration law firm.   I have finally realized that law and Julie Row do not = happiness.  So, other options could be journalism, freelance writing, teaching (i.e. becoming a literature professor!), non-profit organzation(s) involvement/leadership, or working within local/federal government offices.    One thing that is certain, is that I am going to pursue post-undergraduate studies, perhaps by obtaining a masters and/or a doctorate.  I am introverted (meaning I need time to myself!) and nervous in new surroudings.  Once I begin to relax and start showing myself more, I can be a goofy gal who loves to laugh, while not hesitating to show how much dear friends and family mean to me.  I like to chat about guys, films, books, politics and about my spiritual relationship with God.  I hope to one day live in a nice, cozy apartment with plenty of wonderful CDs, great literature, and classy furniture!!!  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Graduated from:  University of California, San Diego (June 2003) Downey High School (June 1999) East Middle School (June 1995) Rio San Gabriel Elementary School (June 1991)  (while @ UCSD) major: political science minor: literature (emphasis on fiction in american and english genres)  ethnicity: Korean American (born and raised in the good 'ole USA)  religion:  Protestant Christianity    "Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God."  Ephesians 5:1 (NIV)  Likes:   fantastic views of the sun and waves  spending time w/my dad and paternal grandmother  romantic comedies  fantasy films & literature (ex. Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter...)  quality Christian music (ex. Steven Curtis Chapman/great praise songs)  jazz music (ex. Michael Buble & Diana Krall)  Josh Groban  Celine Dion  collecting CDs (I used to have close to 150 !)  Fraiser/Friends/Will and Grace (all the characters crack me up!)  traveling to exotic/cultural/exciting places  (i love the idea of traveling... can u tell?)   places I've been to already...   San Diego: La Jolla Cove (seals would always be sleeping/splashing/"honking") Del Mar State Beach (how a beach SHOULD be--clean and endless!) Downtown with its wonderful resturants/malls/theaters  Vancouver, Canada (their streets were clean!  lol!)  the California coast/San Francisco/Oregon/Washington  Grand Canyon, AZ  Flagstaff, AZ & the Navajo reservation nearby    places I want to go to!!!   Boston, New York City, Washington D.C., Maine, Chicago, Alaska, Hawaii  England, Ireland, Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy  Australia and New Zealand  South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan...  and the Phillipines cuz I sponsor a 6 yr. old boy from there

      I am so stressed.  Which probably explains why I had a very bad migraine headache last night--and didn't get to really study or get anything done.  aargh.  I feel much better now, but I've clearly taken things easy for today.  I'm so-o worried about everything.  First, about money, because I'm afraid that right now, I am far from being completey covered.  Things such as upcoming rent and credit card bills...along with enough to go buy food is really bothering me...because I just don't have enough to cover it all.  Then, I'm worried about my classes...I have two papers due in two different classes...finals are coming up...   I really need a sign from the Lord showing me that I need to trust in Him.  I need to know that He has always taken care of me.  That He always will.  Please, anyone who's willing, please pray for me.  (I'm not very happy with my family either.)

      guess who i turned out be like?  St. Augustine... interesting, huh?         "God will not suffer man to have the knowledge of things to come; for if he had prescience  of his prosperity he would be careless; and understanding of his adversity he would be senseless."         You are Augustine!   You love to study tough issues and don't mind it if you lose sleep over them.  Everyone loves you and wants to talk to you and hear your views, you even get things like "nice debating  with you." Yep, you are super smart, even if you are still trying to figure it all out. You're also  very honest, something people admire, even when you do stupid things.        urlLink What theologian are you?   A creation of  urlLink Henderson

      hee hee.  i'm trying to talk street talk--oh, mid-90's style, huh?  but, it is true.  i am hanging out with my close friend from high school.  it's been fun sitting around doing nothing, yet still being able to talk about everything.  we don't see each other often.  other than that, it's been a weekend of seeing family members--whether they be blood family or church family (@ Oikos Community Church).  i'm a little tired now.  time to go pig out and kick back with the homegirl.  see ya soon!

      I'm back at home with my parents and my younger brother here in L.A.   It's quite interesting to be back here after avoiding it for the past 3 months.    reasons for avoiding?    hmm...  probably not wanting to confront family members...being too lazy to make the trip up from San Diego, to pack, and to arrange transportation.  what else?  it's been really kick back here in my own apartment in San Diego, and with my family it would just be a mix of lectures, questions, and driving here to there.  i have to admit though, i do miss my family and i do love them deeply.  but, i can say that i have become deeply accustomed to being out on my own.  just like most college students who live away from home, who are independent from: any economic support, deep involvement, and frequent communication with their parents.  what can i say?   i finally got to see my dad and my brother on friday afternoon, when they came to pick me up at a friend's home in irvine.  i live 30 minutes north of irvine, so the three of us drove back up.  So far, it hasn't been too eventful.  Just a lot of time spent being with my family, which lately i hardly ever do anymore.  my dad is a very reserved, stoic man.  he shows his true self through his devotion and sense of deep commitment.  he never expresses verbally how he feels--it's all in the actions.  for example, my father's a strong christian and as a result, he has always been a heavily involved and committed member of his church.  my mom is a very outgoing, funny woman who loves to be affectionate.  she has a great sense of humor and can be a little emotional too.  i get much of myself from these two people.  those of you who know me well, can see that.  my brother...well, let's just say he's interesting.  my parents have joked that he may have been adopted, or a result of recessive genes.  he's goofy, wild, and loud.  he has grown up recently into a strong young man with passionate dreams and a desire to have a great future.   he was the one, when as a toddler, who couldn't stay still, would draw on the walls, or throw things into the toilet, just to see what the results would be.  this is who i'm spending my weekend with.

      For those of you who would like to personally read the entry about North Korea, as mentioned in my previous entry, here's the link:  urlLink North Korea and Christian Martyrdom   Anyways,  I would just like to say that after I type here for a bit--I am going to further push away the task that I have left before me--my final paper for my Political Science class on political theory of the revolutionary and civil war periods.    I will go and eat dinner.  it is about 6:15 pm right now on the night before it is due.  how typical of me to wait until now...and then further it, by balancing my checkbook for an hour, and doing such tasks as checking email and updating my personal blog.  nothing new.  however, it is good to know that this is the only thing i have left to do for this lovely week of finals here at UC San Diego.  it has been very difficult, i must admit.  wish me luck.  then, maybe i will have more interesting things to say...such as how i am so-o going to see the new lord of the rings movie next wednesday, and there will be for certain, a long and detailed review of the film!!!!  (plus, the one of the magazine too. hee hee)  'till then!

       you know how i have a link on the left of all my pages, that says "blogs4god"?  it's a website that christian bloggers, like myself, can leave their info on, so that others that are interested can click on the links...and get plugged into sites such as this one.  i haven't really checked back until tonight...when, it says by my website...a very small yet bright "cool" by it...which denotes that my site along with others that have the same little "cool" by it, are actually good ones.  am i flattered or what?  maybe it's because i was raging about the north korean christians and how they're being persecuted...the one who established "blogs4god", martin roth, probably saw that i got the info from him.  did i mention him as a reference?  i hope i did.  but look at it...here's the page:  urlLink blogs4god: this website = COOL !    i'm so flattered and happy.  yay!

      Can y'all believe it?  It's going to be 100 years on January 13, 1903, since the very FIRST group of Koreans immigrated from Korea to Honolulu, Hawaii.  Literally, Koreans have been in the United States for 100 years now.  So, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution in July, and now the House of Reps in November, officially sponsoring the celebration of such a tradition.    Koreans rock!  hee hee.   I've been reading my new magazine, "KOREAM", devoted in writing about the growing Korean community in the United States.  can't you tell?   there was this really cool story inside about an elderly couple, Luke and Grace Kim.  two very smart, passionate, and open-minded people.  both are in their 70's, and they don't fit the image that my grandmothers fit.  both of my grandmothers are also in their 70's, yet they have become less able to do physical activity, can only speak a few phrases in English, and always tell about how I need to bow, become fluent in Korean, and be the prime example of filial duty to my parents.  they are from a group that have settled here very late in life, and most of their life had been spent in Korea.  hence, the reason for mode of thinking and mannerisms.  Luke and Grace---boy, are they one of kind.  here's the opening line of the article:  "When's the last time a first-generation KA (Korean American) ever talked to you about the rights of gays and lesbians?"  Titled, "The Power of Two: Luke and Grace Kim fight for your rights" and written by Corina Knoll, this article tells a story of how two people who had been discriminated during the Japanese occupation of Korea for being Christian and Korean, and then again, for being non-conformist during the Communist invasion of the Korean peninsula during the start of the Korean war.  they know truly how to fight for things that are desired.  such simple things that all of us take for granted now--freedom of expression, voting privileges, protection against discrimination and corruption, and finally the right to be who you truly are.    the article details instances of persecution because of suspicion of their children being gay and also about their former intense involvement in the acquittal of Chol Soo Lee, a Korean immigrant innocent of the murder he was convicted of.  through their own experiences, and also because they had the courage to come to the United States during a period when it was still very difficult for Koreans to live without prejudice (the 1960's), they have now established a reputation for being strong about their convictions and their rights in peaceful protest.  wow. two amazing people.  and...they are only two out of the millions who have left family, friends, comfort, and everything one has ever known to immigrate to the United States to grab a chance at opportunities that are not hindered by tradition, customs, or limits.   koreans rock.  don't get me wrong now.  i am not a fanatic nationalist--or one who is so intensely engrossed in the superiority of my heritage that it is the ONLY race that is worth anything.  i am so far from that.  i've always wanted to know about other cultures...and have always kept an open mind about how i make friends and relationships.   but, reading about this couple brings a sense of pride, ya know?  plus, there are countless others...those who are joining politics and even entertainment...which until recently have been seldom visited career fields...  i'm enjoying this magazine.  i completely recommend it.  which gives me an idea!  why not give a more complete review of it on my "review" page?  when I am able to read one or two more issues (which will give me more broad exposure), i will certainly do so.  if interested...look to see it in a month or so.  till then...enjoy this little piece.

      Hello all.  Once again, I am barely surviving, as I once again do my best to crunch what has been stored in my lovely mind in order to spit out  something  for my two literature finals tomorrow.  one of 'em consists of 2-3 essays that i have already outlined possible questions for.  the other one consists of terms that i must memorize, and two essays that i am not ready to answer.  i don't even know what one question will ask about.  i really found this class to be boring.  and, now my disinterest is catching up with me.  yay.  wish me luck.  after this next week (like fri. the 13th after 11 am when my last paper is due)  will be when i can actually relax.

      I need to take a quick breather.  I just finished typing five straight pages (yes, that is a lot for me in one setting)....in one hour.  oh wow.  i thought it would take me longer.  wait, was it only four pages?  duh.  look at the page # next time.  still.  i think i'm doing ok, for the fact that I procrastinate like no other...and that i need to type AT LEAST four more.  and, i have another 6 pager to do.  and a one page journal.  and reading.  and finals.  i have TWO back to back on monday.  and all this writing and papers...they're all due tomorrow.  can i scream?  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  thanks.   but, i find that topic that i'm writing about is easy for me--Japanese internment during World War II.   who knew?  how come, when i had to write about political parties, or when i had to write about poems, it was so-o hard?  i'm coming up with this paper so fast.  it's almost unbelievable.   i promised that the next time i came back that i would discuss my sentiments for the lovely holidays.  you know what i forgot to do?  i forgot to tell y'all about what i'm thankful for.  i know that it's super late to do so now, but, i still think i should do it.  so here goes.   Top 10 Things I'm Thankful For:  (least to most important)  1.  my new fuzzy slippers  (my toes are finally warm! ) 2.  egg nog ice cream  ( somehow, when it's more solidified...the taste seems to be more enjoyable) 3.  my own room (i can snore and not be paranoid...i can play my music whenever i want...i can be neat...and not be subconsciously bothered by others' messes) 4.  winter quarter's classes (ex. gospel choir, literature course on jane austen, literature course on the 60s) 5.  my senior year (in 7 months...i'm graduating with a BA in political science!) 6.  Intervarsity: it's helped me to meet some great people (i.e. small group) 7.  my roommates (I'm getting along very well with both of them) 8.  my friends ( through Intervarsity, church, high school, UCSD, and other miscellaneous connections) 9.  my family (Mom, Dad, my brother), and extended family (uncles, aunt, cousins, grandmothers...) 10.  GOD--He always molding me, shaping me, humbling me, and helping me to see in order to do the work He has set out for me.  (i think i know what that may be, but that's for another blog)  Christmas...  I love the twinkling lights...the light smell of a live tree...the soothing songs on CDs...the images of snow and mountains (that i cannot experience firsthand here in California)...Santa Claus...the spirit of joy and giving...building fires...  it's not all about the gifts.  i have much more i want to say...but back to my work!  wish me luck!

      Yes, I have seriously neglected this website.  I have been avoiding contact with my family...and have been trying to be alone for awhile.    But, now that the holidays are approaching, I cannot do that any longer.  Plus, my father called right before Thanksgiving and now I'm feeling better about visiting them.  moving on, i love christmas.  it's not even because of the gifts.  it's the whole feeling of being comfortable, happy, and thinking about things that make you smile.    you know what?  i'm too tired to go too deep into this now.  i'll be back later.   but, just know that i am officially back on this site...i will be faithful in keeping it updated.

      Normally, I would not even bother putting in an entry.  But, I am indirectly doing all that I can to avoid the completion of my paper.  Can you tell?  It's already past 3 a.m.  I look out the window...and all the other windows are dark, signalling the fact that I am probably the only one awake within the vincinity of two to three apartment buildings.  aargh.  Things have been hectic for me lately.  sorry for the lack of updates...i seem to wait a week or something before i decide i should at least stick a few sentences here.  i seemed to have chosen classes that have demanding loads of work...especially for the month of february.  i am not looking forward to february.  i have four or five papers...and one exam.  plus, i'm probably going to have to start figuring out what to do for my class presentation for my literature class on the 60's.  on top of all that, i must do my best to attend bible studies twice a week...do daily devotionals...and, save and earn enough money to get by.    aargh.  please pray for me.  i'm feeling overwhelmed right now.

      Hello all...  Apologies to the lack of content for the past couple of weeks.  For me, here at UC San Diego, school took off and started.  Had to get accustomed to the professors and classes...along with the demands of a much busier schedule.  Anyways, I finally got to see the car that my brother had been bragging about before.  It was pretty nice--I don't blame my brother for getting a new one.  as in...right off the lot.  no former owners.  he came down to visit, cuz he can drive down now...and, we got to hang out for a couple of days.  isn't it nice to be able to say that i can hang out with my brother?  he used to be someone i had difficulty getting along with.  times have changed.  i'm a little stressed, cuz i just realized an hour ago, that i have a quiz in one of my classes...and i have not studied whatsoever.  do you think that the fact that i had paid attention in class will help me to do fairly on it?  i hope so.  it is way too late for me to start cramming.  i need my sleep.  hopefully, i will add much more this weekend.  i hope all of you have a great weekend!

      I would just like to comment on the impact the purchase of a new car can make on an individual.  My brother has just bought a new 2003 Honda Civic in royal blue, with 2 doors and a nice CD player.  And...he is ecstatic!    Only earlier this week, he was fuming at the mouth over his disagreement with my mother.  I call only two days later, to hear how he has changed completely into a happy and talkative person.  I'm happy...and I wish I had one too.  A nice silver SUV (Honda CRV?)  with a CD changer and automatic eveything.  hee hee.  he talked about it for a good...45 minutes i believe.  which is why i am still up.  time to sleep now tho!  good night!

      Hello!

      As I calmly wait for my turn to take a shower right now, I am intrigued by the many ideas and thoughts I would like to add onto this site.  I have neglected it...  Over the holiday season, I was able to watch Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, twice.  I also saw Gangs of New York, Catch Me If You Can, as well as several other movies on video, such as Unfaithful (I don't recommend...right away), Someone Like You, Ballistic, XXX with Vin Diesel, Head Over Heels, Austin Powers: Goldmember, etc.  you can tell what I did during the break.  hee hee.  I also spent much time with the immediate family and also with my cousins from my mother's side of the family.  it was nice.  but, as the day for school to start approached, I knew I was ready to go back south to San Diego.  (my family lives in Los Angeles.)  So, there is a point to all of this rambling.  I think tomorrow whenever I decide to take a break from studying, I will review the movies I deem worthy of my attention.  Plus, I am taking a class on Jane Austen--I would love to discuss her very famous books.  why not?  it will prepare me for the two papers I need to write for that class.  very busy and interesting day.  today was the first day of classes.  the madness has officially begun.  I've already bought all my books and supplies, paid all my bills, and arranged my schedules and written it all down.  (I am also very notorious for being neat and organized.)  for example, in front of me, I have all of my books lined up according to classes.  they are also arranged according to the chronological order by which I take the classes.    for the classes that have already determined dates for exams and papers, I have already written that all down in my planner and calendar and highlighted them.  don't worry--I know that I am not normal...I will readily admit that.  hee hee.  it's interesting though, because last quarter the classes were about topics that I could tolerate but could not get myself to be interested in.  however, this time around, I actually may enjoy at least a couple of them.  like mentioned before, one of my literature classes is about the famous novels of Jane Austen, while my other literature class is about the very famous music of the 1960s.  cool huh?  I am also taking gospel choir, and two other political science classes, one being about political paradoxes of modern democracy, and the other about the basic fundamentals of East Asian nations.  not bad.  after paying approximately $370 for all of my books, course readers included, I will now have to try even more harder to get a part time job.  yay.  I don't know why, but the one hour of TV that I watched tonight was when I was seeing "Everwood".  For some odd reason, I really like the show.  I was actually laughing out loud.  For any of you who have seen it too, you may understand why.  Maybe it's the setting of the show...in a small town near the Colorado Rockies...I've always loved being in the countryside, the mountains, or by the beach...don't know I could permanently live in a small town though.  Finally, I devoted some time to my prayer journal.  It was my first entry of the year.  I wrote down all my goals for the year, whether it be spiritual or not...because I am going to keep faith that if any of them are according to God's will, that they will be achieved in His name...and that it will be for His glory alone.  It was a simple list of needs and desires...maybe I need to determine which ones are which.  I put a star by the one that clearly was about my relationship with God.  did any of you see my previous entry about my resolution?  not that much difference from that one.  I wrote down 21 things...for every year of my life.  here's some of the more casual and not too personal ones:  1) 3.0 GPA 2) finish all reading, assignments, and papers on time having worked on them ahead of time 3) learn how to swim butterfly and breaststroke flawlessly 4) wait a month before actually buying a CD (I tend to buy too many) 5) part time job for the academic year   and of course, there are 16 more...but they're gonna have to stay between me and God.  sorry.  I like doing this...writing out my feelings and thoughts make it so much more  organized  and easier to remember.   I also want to spend some time in a remote place (I.e. mountain, beach) and spend some time in prayer.  I want to symbolically remove things from my life...and ask God to give other things in their stead.  (inspiration = wonderful friend Elyse)   this is really helping me to be calm, happy, and at peace.  I would suggest it to anyone.  anyways, my roommates are done with the shower.  I'll be back tomorrow.

      I've entered in the prior resolution for this year because, honestly, I have fallen away from my relationship with God.  After this holiday season, I realized how much I needed the Lord in my life.  Especially tonight.  After I had a couple of unpleasant experiences with my brother and a friend, I decided that I would think and reflect about my spiritual welfare.  It stinks.  Why?  I feel this way because I've  known that I needed to get back on track for a long time now...even before I left a church I had attended for more than a year.    I need to stop letting others in my life guide me--it needs to be God..and, tonight when two people whom I either love dearly or see often, hurt my feelings, I realized that I need to pull myself out of the hole I was digging myself into.  Once again, I had started to let how they were feeling--and as a result, how they were treating me, make me feel depressed and unloved.  But wait!  God has always loved me and always will.  so, that is why I have had such a source of inspiration.  Anyways, because of my lovely and dear friend Elyse, I have also been inspired to start a prayer journal.  It's basically writing out your prayers every day.  That way, for someone like me who is a visual learner, can remember what I have talked about with God.  cool, huh?  school starts tomorrow...and this is my true and real way of getting ready for a new year.  A year during which I will graduate college, decide on a career, and do my best to know God in a deeper way.  I will keep all those who I know and who I cherish in my prayers...instead of automatically letting them influence me, whether it be good or bad.  It needs to be only God.

      Hello everyone!  It has been close to a month since I have entered anything.  I apologize for that.  I know these are just excuses, but first it was because of finals, then Christmas...then New Year's.  you know how it is.  I feel different this time around though.  you know how EVERYONE is trying to start New Year's resolutions...lose weight...stop smoking...get a better job...get better grades...earn more money....  mine has always been the same: lose 40-60 pounds.  see, it's all because I am no small young woman.  and, I've always wanted to slim down and be toned like an Olympic athlete (or at least look similar to one).  but, all of those ambitions have become so-o secondary compared to my one and only goal for this year.  It's quite simple actually.    I want to become close and intimate with God--so close that whenever something happens in my life...whether it be bad or even good...He is the first one I go to...and, the only one who makes the ultimate difference.   I want God to be the first thing I think about in the mornings...and, the last thing before I fall asleep.    that one simple goal will actually affect all of my life--all the small little details and functions of my life.    I CAN ONLY IMAGINE...what that would be like.   I would no longer let others around me influence my mood, my emotions, my confidence, my self-image, my ambitions...my heart.   guess who would.   I have several things in mind that I will do my best to do.    1) daily devotionals 2) daily prayer journal 3) consistent church going on Sundays 4) consistent attendance of all committed Bible studies

      NO, I am not going to sing anything out of Disney's "Mulan".   (although, I do think that that song is quite cute)  I'm just thinking back on this year, this month, this week, and the day so far...  I feel like time has literally passed me by because it's gone so fast, and here I am wondering what happened.  I'm already going to finish my winter quarter here @ UC San Diego.  I will soon start my last and spring quarter. :(  In a way, I guess you can say that that's good.  Why, do u ask?  NO MORE papers, exams, reading, late nights due to academics, etc, etc...   But, I will definitely miss the friends I have made here @ UCSD, as well as the life of a fairly independent college student.   I get the feeling more and more, that due to the lack of finances, I will have to move back in with my parents.  (yay...)  I will definitely try and apply for those teaching jobs though...it's as if they're symbolic...a tiny white light @ the end of a tunnel  I am physically tired.  I have really not been getting enough sleep...or so I feel like.  My roomies have been saying that I should go see a doctor (would those of you who know the personal details of my health agree?)  I just don't want to exaggerate anything.  Aargh.  I really feel uncomfortable when I go to the doctor and he tells me I'm fine, when I've been feeling not so fine for the past couple of weeks...maybe a month.  this quarter's been tough for me by the way.  the load that my classes have appeared to heap on me, is quite overwhelming at times.  I have a difficult paper due on Monday, the day after my birthday.  how sad.  couldn't my professor have waited at least until the next day we meet?   like I said before, I will try to get this done by the night before my birthday.  I'm turning 22...and yet, I feel so old.  I know my mother would give me the look if she saw this.    I gotta go now.  I have to work on said paper.

      Hello all.  I had a group presentation to prepare for tonight. So, I typed my part out, that I'm going to say during class, and  I drank two cups of milky, sugary coffee...and I figured that it would be enough to keep me awake for about two to three hours.  guess what though?  i'm still wide awake...especially since  I can type this quickly and with no error.  yikes.  I'm not even yawning.    anyways, i think i know enough about motown and the female groups that it established to talk for four minutes.  i'm pretty good at BS-ing my way through stuff as it is.  hmm...whenever i walk into my room, i get a strong whiff of clean laundry and stale coffee.  definite signs of my prior activity tonight.  i know that i promised reviews of the new five cds that i have purchased since christmas...will do maybe this weekend, while i'm putting off my next paper that's due on the 3rd.  oh, wait.  that can't be put off.  i have my own b-day to celebrate on the 2nd.  DARN.  all that joy of procrastination and the pressure of limited time.  guess what the rest of this week and the early weekend's for then.  yay.  i'm so excited. (picture hearing a dull, somber tone)  other than THAT paper, i sitll have a 12-15 pg. research paper for the same music class that i have prepared for tonight...and a couple of applications to fill out and send.    can y'all picture me as an elementary school teacher in the LA Unified?  i'm gonna try and get a position somewhere not too ghetto.    i think teaching would get me some good experience while i wait to go to grad school...and if i do through a special program then, wouldn't it be more organzied and it would look better on a resume?  all of that...plus finals for march.  boy, am i looking forward to it.  (you can just hear the sound of my sarcasm)  it's raining heavy outside now.  i can hear it.  you know what's funny?  i tried to put in earplugs last night to drown out the sound of the rain...and they both fell out.  do u think it's worth it for me?      if i don't get back to this b4 sun...i'm gonna turn 22!  i feel old.  (the cd reviews are comin'!  i promise! as well as other added content on this and other pages... sowee)

      Isn't it ironic how I always say that I'll try and do things ahead of time...and it just does not EVER happen?  especially in regards to academics.  once again, folks, I have something that is due tomorrow...that I have waited until tonight to finish.  but...there is one thing you must be proud of.  I actually researched on the topic and started on it...   hee hee!  I just didn't finish it!  so, here i am, in front of the computer @ 12:53 am trying to finish it off.  You know what though?  The topic is actually interesting.  I need to speak for 4 minutes tomorrow morning on the general background of Motown Records.  not bad.  i actually typed out 1 page of what I am going to say already.    see, i did that this weekend!  Sometimes, I wonder though.  I waste so much time watching TV and hanging out, doing pretty much nothing when I have a full load of classes, and prospective jobs to search for, in preparation for post-grad times.

      Do any of you out there realize there is a holocaust of another kind going on as I type this?  There are so few people out in the world right now helping those who suffer, who run away, who barely survive.  I am so fed up with the ignorance and unwillingness of so many to educate themselves and to help in any way possible.  I myself, as a young college student cannot do anything big just yet, but you know what?  i sure can do my best to let people know what's going on...that's what this website is for.  for those of you who don't know...as i type now, in my comfortable single room in quiet and peaceful San Diego, CA., there are hundreds of thousands...possibly millions of people in North Korea who suffer from starvation, from a communist regime who strips them of all basic rights, and within camps that are at best slave labor camps.  Christians...who will not stop proclaiming who their true God is are being killed, tortured, beaten, and starved for believing in the one God who had sent Jesus as their Saviour.  They out of many are persecuted for not proclaiming and believing that Kim Jong-Il the political leader, is their god.  I'm so outraged even more so now, because North Korea, in response to the pressure they have received in regards to their nuclear program has started 100 days of a more intense and determined search to capture any North Koreans who have escaped, especially in China, where they are not given asylum and are treated no better than dirt.  God has clearly blessed me...many times more than I deserve, or any of you out there who are nowhere close to suffering as much as the population of North Korea...especially the Christians.  It is a holocaust once more, and for those of us who know what's going on--the least that we can do is spread the word.  here's a great website:  urlLink The Chosun Journal   read as much as you can, when you can.  There are also many Korean Americans, South Koreans, and other foreign people who have the desire to help and do so.  One German doctor, named Norbert Vollertsen, has done so, after living in North Korea for a year and a half.   Here are some articles about him:    urlLink World Magazine: "Paying a debt to history"   urlLink Chosen Journal: "Interview with Norbert Vollertsen"   urlLink Time Asia: "Diary of A Mad Place"   I focus on this German doctor, because he does not hesitate to speak publicly about North Korea and his experiences, and unlike refugees and defectors who have families to protect back home and other things inhibiting their accounts, he does not have such factors holding him back.  It is probable that his accounts are correct and un-exaggerated.  The least that any of you can do is at least spread the word, send correspondence to your government or the U.N., or to write and post information also, so that when enough people are gathered together to speak out, or to do something of considerable size and influence, that it will make changes.   It just does not make any sense.  South Korean youth are understandably angry at the United States in regards to the murder of two South Korean girls by American GI's...but do they not know that just to the north, there are thousands of other Koreans who are dying and suffering also?  Why can't they promote that cause...or protest about that situation?  I know that the "Sunshine Policy", or reunification is encouraged...but does that stop or justify the persecution within the labor camps...does it stop the holocaust?  Please...pray for North Korea also.  I know I will...every day that I can.   Lord,  I beg that You look down upon the state of North Korea right now as You hear my prayer.  I ask that You protect those who die and suffer because they love You and proclaim Your name to be the only one to worship.  I ask that You help the government, the leaders, and other foreign leaders to realize the sins that they are doing.  May You stop the suffering, the starvation, the torture, the capture, the imprisonment, the dictator-like regime, and anything that is horrible in Your name.  May You help North Korea either become a nation of morals and political freedom, or to possibly reunite it with South Korea--a nation that is on it's path to being successful as a democratic nation.  May you give me the strength, the words, and reminders, so that I can do what little I can do spread the word and help the cause.  May Your name be glorified.  Amen.

      guess what guys?  yes, you're right!  once again, it is the night before one of my lovely six papers of Feb. are due!  this time it is for my poli sci class on asia--i must compare and contrast the constitutional powers of the presidents of both south korea and taiwan.  yay!  so, i've been going thru korea's constitution, seeing which articles will affect the power and role of a president.  could i have begun to do this much earlier?  i think...yes!   why i am (as usual) doing it last minute but without any anxiety or stress?  maybe because the first paper for this class was done so quickly.   i had started on the night before for the last paper, and found myself going to bed by 2.  oh the irony.  one thing to add quickly... i am suddenly inspired to review the three new christian cds i have been able to listen to...and the two classical music ones too.  plus, there's other things to add on my "about me" page...will do by the time president's day is over!  other than that....good night!

      I see that the number of visitors has climbed up to over 1,000!  I remember in the early days, when my first and simple website, had a total of 20 visitors...in about a month.  oh the irony.  what makes things more better this time?  maybe, cuz I'm not complaining about how I'm not getting along with roommates?    maybe, it's because I have other pages with miscellaneous information...even a mp3 or two.    who knows.   one thing is for sure though.  let me put this in bold:   Apologies to those who come here for lyrics, mp3s that I have already taken off because of the lack of space, for mp3s that aren't even on here (I have reviews of different songs and Cds...maybe that's why I have people looking for lyrics and songs), and for any other info that you will not get here .    Sometimes, I'll go to a certain site that helps me check out the details on who's been viewing my website, and it's interesting to see the things people typed in search engines...that ended up on my website as a result.  However, if you don't mind reading away about how a female college senior is dealing with life in general...why not stay anyways?  hee hee.  today, I didn't do much.  I slept in very late...and I knew I should have gone to church, but for those of you who don't know, I've been feeling very tired if I don't get a lot more sleep than I have been.  I'll get migraine-like headaches and so on.  I need to work on that.  then, I went to go eat Chinese food with my two roomies...we've been hanging out and joking around with each other more often.  it's actually been very fun.  my other roomie, whose name is Julie also, likes to poke fun at Liz...and Julie and I sometimes join forces.  it's hilarious.  then, we went to the market to buy freshly baked coconut bread at Ranch 99 Market...I bought other stuff too, but the bread really hit the spot.    finally, we all came home and either studied...or pretended to, while in reality one of us would watch TV or chat on the phone.  very relaxing weekend for me, I must say.  I didn't get much studying done.  bad Julie!  I will need to make up for it starting tomorrow.   I've been thinking about what to do after graduation.  I will graduate in the middle of June this year from college, and I've already decided not to pursue graduate studies until a year or two later.  Several options come to mind, such as, AmeriCorps, Teach for America, entry level private employment, and always the most easiest--move back home with the parents.  My brother and I have actually been discussing the possibility in obtaining an apartment on our own--we both realize the luxuries of not living with our parents, once one reaches 18 and beyond...despite the fact that we owe them our love and gratitude for the many years of love and sacrifice they have given to us as our parents.  c'mon.  we all need to branch out and become "adult"-like.  If I were to do that though, I really need to find a job before graduation approaches.  Things to ponder...  Can I just say that on top of all that, I have two papers due this week...and another one due the next week?  It never stops.    Perhaps, God has planned this quarter to be clearly my most busiest quarter of school my senior year, because there is something that is needed to be learned through all of this.  what could it be?  patience?  clear vision?  determination and endurance?  strength of mind, body, and especially spirit?  who knows...only time will tell.  I promised earlier that I would include some mental reflections on what's been going on lately.  Two things are tending to stick out in my mind.  the Columbia tragedy and the north Korean issue.    my roommate and I were watching 60 minutes tonight, and we both were disturbed by the "side" that the show seemed to take on the north Korean issue.  we all know here in the united states, that there is a sense of danger and concern.  my roommate was more adamantly indignant and angry that the show was showing south Koreans as ungrateful and angry towards US and its presence in South Korea through the military.  I do admit that south Koreans are aggressively unhappy towards the US and its military, but as she points out, that anger does not appear out of thin air.  most south Koreans support reunification and aid for north Korea rather than calling it an "axis of evil".  I myself do not deny the possibility in the danger of the north Korean's ruling regime...as a Korean American myself however, which signifies how someone like myself is a part of both the Korean and American "worlds"... it is difficult to say, what the best policy is to take regarding the overall issue.  as for the Columbia tragedy...the day that it happened, I sent up a prayer for all of those who suffered because of it.  it's one thing to hear that something like that happened in the history of NASA, but to actually be alive and aware during an incident...is something that really opens one's eyes wide.  personally, I realized the real sacrifice and possible danger there is being an astronaut--every trip that is taken by such people also symbolizes the risks and sacrifices involved.  sacrifice--an aspect I did not realize clearly until now.  may the lord watch over the astronauts' families, and everyone else who was directly involved and affected.  wow.  it's already close to 1 a.m.  I think I need to stop here b4 I catch myself typing for too long.  I'll get back to this laters...  good night everyone!

      Today I turned in the paper I had been working on last night.  phew.  that's the second one in a week--one was due last Wednesday, and this one was due today, the next Wednesday.    I finally feel like I can kick my feet up on my desk and relax.  I do have a midterm in one of my literature classes on Friday--it's the class on Jane Austen.  I just need to make sure to finish  Pride and Prejudice , and to review what  Sense and Sensibility  was all about.  however, despite this exam, which by the way I am not really nervous about--I am feeling more relaxed and calm.  perhaps, my prayers to God asking Him to help my sensitivity to stress and lack of sleep have been answered through the natural tendency for me to feel very calm....perhaps, this will help me also sleep better tonight!  despite the fact that I still need to get a job..!  hope tomorrow is productive.  by the way...a new song that y'all can download is on my download page.  enjoy!  good night!

      First, I want to say thanks to the one who left a comment saying that the only way to get through times of stress is to....laugh.  I know that the one thing that helps me laugh is a good book...or even better, a great show.  usually will and grace or friends.  anyways, once again, i am sitting here, trying to write a paper.  but this time, it's better!  i promise...i've already started my third page!  it's basically a question and answer assignment rather than a paper...but, guess who calls it a "paper"?   this time, i know i'll go to sleep b4...hopefully 2 am.  and, i just finished an interview today.  although i have this prediction that i won't get the job---i was so-o nervous today at the interview...i stuttered...i would pause...i actually said..."ah...i'm sorry i can't talk today!"  could i be any more nerdier?  (hee hee)  my explanation--it's been awhile since i've been interviewed... darn, i used to be a lot better at it too...not even nervous.  but, the interview also signals the fact that i am not "taboo" to the demanding positions on campus...they actually want me!   could i actually get a consistent source of income again?   moving on, this month i am busy.  i may not always enter things onto this site.  i apologize in advance.   maybe this weekend i will add more reflections on what's been going on...i.e. Columbia tragedy, daily life....etc., etc.  good night!

      it's interesting to reflect back on what someone says about you, and finally realize the depth of truth that their statements convey.  i finished the last part of my five-hour long "interview" during which i actually am being interviewed one-on-one, when the female representative of LA Teaching Fellows replied, " You just breathed a sigh of...relief.  Did you feel like this was difficult?"  and i honestly replied that speaking wasn't my strength, and that I expressed myself better when I wrote.    here's the thing though.  if i really did breath a huge sigh of relief, not only is it because my big "interview" was over, but it was a sign that everything that had been giving me stress for the past four months was finally taken care of.  my winter quarter and four demanding academic courses ended two weeks ago.  this interview for a prospective job has finally been completed.  i've been nervously anticipating this interview for the past two months...especially the past two weeks when i had to decide whether to give up a great trip to catalina in order to go to the interview.  and, i've finally received an ample sum of finances for my last quarter of college, and i am financially covered.    phew.  Phew.  PHEW!!!!!!  there.  that was three of 'em.  i feel like a huge burden has been lifted.    now, all i have to do is wait for a response...will i get hired?  will i not?  all i know for sure is that everything will happen according to God's will, and I need to believe it to be the only truth.  I will not beat myself up over the details of the interview today, or about my past academic quarter.  i cannot regret saying certain statements, or doing specific actions.  i will only mentally beat myself up, and will only make myself feel worse.  Having faith that God is at work planning my life is the only way to gain confidence and keep it.  phew.  i will add more later, this internet program is kicking me off.  i really dislike phone modems.  i miss my computer in san diego...aargh.

      Hello everyone.  The past three months have been so hectic for me.  This past winter quarter down in San Diego at my school, UC San Diego has been crazy because not only did I have a full load of classes, but those classes were pretty demanding too.  It's all over now!   I finally decided not to go to Catalina for my spring break (boo hoo...)  and instead come up to LA because I have a very important interview with the LA Unified School District @ 8:30am tomorrow.    I AM SO NERVOUS!  I am going to pray fervently that God will be with me and inspire me to show my true character and that whatever my true character is, is what they need for a teacher @ LA Unified.  I need to be confident!  Today, I am at the public library (I really miss having my own computer down in SD), and I wanted to check my email, my bank account, and this lovely website, when I decided to update it as well too.  After I mess around with the computers they have here, as I am doing now, I will go to a nice corner and try to make a "lesson plan" for tomorrow.  I must teach for 5 minutes.  for all my lovely close and dear friends...please pray for me.  please pray that this job is God's will.  anyways, can't stay online too long here...gotta go!

      I apologize to those of you who did read my most recent post (that I just deleted) about my experience at what is known as the "Sunshine" Store.  I was angry about the lack of customer service I received during the week that I had been enduring my finals.   I will add more later.  My father is supposed to pick me up soon from the library.  wish me luck on my interview...i must gather my resources that I obtained from the library and give it my best shot.    i'm crossing my fingers!

      Well, folks...  It is now time to procrastinate once more.  I am now officially working on my last final.  All three of my other finals have been in-class exams.  I feel that I have no other choice but to move on from those exams--I did the best that I could.  I usually do not take those often, because I am quite used to writing papers.  However, this last paper is difficult for me, because the class I am writing it for is not of great interest to me.  The professor, although well-liked, well-read, and quite intelligent has also been consistently theoretical and complicated with his weekly lectures.    Now, I am to drag myself through an 8 page paper.  I must "explain the paradox of political enforcement".  See what I mean?  Would any non-political science major know anything about that?  I doubt it.  It has been a difficult week.  I have also overdramatized a decision I had made concerning my spring break.  I was in deep thought over two options:  Catalina Island vs.  LA (immediate family).   Yes, I know.  Most college students would not even have hesitated.  A chance to go to Catalina Island for one full week and spend it with fellow Christian college students...why would anyone normal pass that up, right?    Well...I have also been given an opportunity to go to a very detailed and complicated job interview with the LA Unified School District.  If I am selected, I will become a teacher, full time, and a credential obtainer, full time.  Not only must I perform well during a personal interview, I must prepare and share a 5 minute lesson, read 3 articles, participate in a group discussion, and complete a 20 minute writing prompt.  yikes.  I have officially decided to pass up on my opportunity to go to Catalina.  Wish me luck...and for those of you who I have already asked to pray for me...please continue to do so.  I really, really want to make sure that this is what God wants me to do after my college graduation.  I would have to do the interview and take two exams...and participate in a 6 week teachers' "boot camp" during the summer.  It is getting late tonight (morning?) and I still have not directly typed any words for this paper.  It's supposed to be 8 pages!  I am thanking the Lord right now that the paper will not be due until 4 pm tomorrow afternoon.  That gives me time to procrastinate more.  I really want to figure out what to say...write an outline...maybe write the first page...and sleep for a short amount of time, before I do my best to complete this paper.    Wish me luck on this paper too...I really need it.    I have many things I would have loved to share with all of you on this website...but it is clear that there are only a few things on my mind.  These things are clearly in dominance.    Hopefully I can share about my personal life...my spirituality...my opinions on current events...and so forth when it is ALL OVER.    Aargh.  Laters!

      Isn't it interesting how we, as a society, will always look back on our past and always desire to be back in the times when things seemed so exciting?    I say this about the decade of the 1960's.  I am going to write the LAST paper of this quarter before finals on the 60's and how Motown would help start the success of African American artists within pop and R&B music.

      Hello all.  I feel like I'm about to collapse.  For those of you who don't know...yesterday was my b-day!    for some odd reason, turning 22 feels weird.  you don't feel like you have all these cool things you can do now that you're a certain age...and yet, you're not old enough to feel sorry for yourself.  one thing's for sure...it's kinda like someone's thrown a reality check at ya...you're not a little kid anymore...u know?  yesterday, I was so busy.  I spent the earlier part of the day researching for the paper I should have completed by Saturday.  Then, I went to the library to do some more research.  Then, I had an interview @ 4p...I think I'm gonna become a nanny for a very cute and energetic one year old boy named Lucas.  He's got the prettiest eyes.  (sparkly blue...and huge.)  then, I went to Rock Bottom Restaurant to eat dinner with about 15 people...it was fun.  it was good seeing all of my friends hanging out...and people from small group who came were those I was closer with or knew more better anyways.  then...I went to sun and lisa's house to play taboo with about five to six other people...  it was fun just hanging out and laughing.  no fancy affair...no alcohol (which I can't drink anyways due to specific health concerns)    then, I came home and stayed up all night doing political statistic calculations and typing my paper.  yuck.  I can also say HALLELUJAH!   I  do not have to write another paper for that poli sci class ever again!!!!  I will have to take a final though...but I'm hoping I'll do better on that, than on a paper I have to come up with a hypothesis for.  after this, I have another research paper...two applications to fill out...one for LA teaching Fellows and another for my degree!  by March 12...when I turn in that final paper...I will only have finals left.    ugh.  I really hope spring quarter's easier for me...cuz right now I'm really sleepy...and, I think I had a seizure last night.   why do u ask?  cuz, I was really tired...and, I was trying to open the present one of my roomies had given me...and then all of a sudden, I'm in my room and its nowhere to be found.  I search for a good 30 minutes to an hour...and I finally find the box in the bathroom's trash.  I would never do that just by "accident".  for those of you who know me...I am miss neat freak!  pray for me...I think I'm gonna rest when I come back from turning in my paper.

      ok...i started looking around on the web for a new design, and finally found some great looking ones @  urlLink BlogFrocks .  Actually, finding a new template (design) wasn't too hard, and I finally had 2 or 3 to choose from.   It was getting all my info organized...those of you who know me well, know that i am very anal and meticulous when it comes to wanting to have personal things well organized and just so...and i consider this blog to be personal.  hope all of you enjoy the new design.  i will explain how my life has been....maybe FINALLY stick in those reviews....and explain why i chose this particular design.    good night (morning).

          urlLink Official "Better Luck Tomorrow" Website     This new movie is already out in major cities such as New York and Los Angeles, and it will gain a wider range of audience starting the 18th (this Friday).  I am excited, because although it is not a completely positive depiction of young Asian Americans--we're finally getting coverage.  It does however deal with issues that we as young Asian Americans face, with our families, and with the American public.  Roger Ebert has a great review on it...look to the left, where I have a link to his site.  This picture was the best one I could find  urlLink (Internet Movie Database) ...and not all of the cast members are in this picture.  For example, John Cho from "Off Centre" (WB Show) is not in here.  But, its most of them.  Enjoy!

      I went onto a fellow christian college student's website  urlLink (footprints of my life)  to find this:  "Wish You Were Here"  For all the free people that still protest. You're welcome. We protect you and you are protected by the best. Your voice is strong and loud, but who will fight for you? No one standing in your crowd. We are your fathers, brothers, and sons, wearing the boots and carrying guns. We are the ones that leave all we own, to make sure your future is carved in stone. We are the ones who fight and die, We might not be able to save the world, Well, at least we try. We walked the paths to where we are at and we want no choice other than that. so when you rally your group to complain, take a look in the back of your brain. In order for that flag you love to fly wars must be fought and young men must die. We came here to fight for the ones we hold dear. If that's not respected, we would rather stay here. So please stop yelling, put down your signs, and pray for those behind enemy lines. When the conflict is over and all is well, be thankful that we chose to go through hell.  -Corporal Joshua Miles and all the boys from 3rd Battalion 2nd Marines, Kuwait    Before anyone misunderstands my intentions...  I am not for or against the war.  I can honestly say that due to the fact that it is happened before I feel like I have had enough time to develop a justified opinion, and also because it has happened despite the potential i most likely do not have to change anything...  what i do know for certain is that there is a large number of those in the middle east who are risking everything to make sure that we all are safe and accounted for...and are doing only what their country has asked them to do, despite  their  own opinions.  even my own cousin, who only has a green card, and who has been living in the united states for only two years now, will go to iraq next month.  people tell me that because of what's been happening this week that i should probably assume that he might not need to go.    the war will only be over when saddam hussein is clearly accounted for...whether they kill him or not--it is not my place to say what should happen.  all i know is that nothing is for certain today.  not yet.  instead, let us read this poem...and pray for those who have sacrificed alot so that we do have the freedom to speak our minds without being legally persecuted.  Let us ask the Lord to watch over them.

      I find it interesting that both my roommates, as well as several of my friends are not impressed with Mr. Ivan Shaw.  (see entry titled, "wow!")   oh well, everyone has different taste, and that just means that Yvonne and I can have him all to ourselves!  hee hee.  y'all might want to watch him in action though...he looks better on camera that films than on a camera that develops film.   anyway, I am feeling quite energized due to the large quantity of coke that I had with dinner, as well as the cup of coffee that I had before I left to go for my job as a tutor.    by the way, is anyone curious about that?  I tutor a laid back 15 year old male who is a recent newcomer to the US from Korea.  all I have to say is that, this job and this student has caused me to defend the US like no other.  For those of you who don't know, many young and native Koreans have anti-US sentiment right now.  It's due to legal issues over the killing of two young female students by US soldiers in South Korea, as well as the role that the Bush administration is playing with North Korea and its threat of nuclear weapons.  I am listening to Mandy Moore's "Only Hope".  The lyrics go like this:  There's a song that inside of my soul.  It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again.  I'm awake in the infinite cold,  but you sing to me over and over and over again. So I lay my head back down,  and I lift my hands and pray to be only yours  I pray to be only yours.  I know now you're my only hope. Sing to me the song of the stars.  Of your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again.  When it feels like my dreams are so far,  sing to me of the plans that you have for me over again.  So I lay my head back down,  and I lift my hands and pray to be only yours  I pray to be only yours.  I know now you're my only hope. I give you my destiny.  I'm giving you all of me.  I want your symphony.  Singing in all that I am.  At the top of my lungs, I'm giving it back. So I lay my head back down,  and I lift my hands and pray to be only yours  I pray to be only yours.  I know now you're my only hope.  Although within the film titled, "A Walk to Remember", the focus is leaning towards a blossoming romance among two young high school students when this song is played (or sung rather, by Mandy Moore herself), when I hear the words, I can picture it being sung for other reasons.  I have friends who either love this movie, or think that this film is just another sappy teen romance, but I enjoy it because it brings the purity and peace that a Christian believer may possess even under difficulty in the "limelight".    When I read these lyrics just now, I can see it being sung to God himself.  Who else can we turn to, when sometimes He is our "only hope"?  There's another source that displays this message clearly, and it is within the book titled,  Sutter's Cross  by W. Dale Cramer.  It is the first Christian fiction I have read and I am definitely enjoying it's story.  When I have time this weekend, I will describe in more detail on my "religious review" page.  I find that I myself am more at peace this quarter.  As mentioned before in previous entries, I am not stressed out over how my LA Unified School District interview resulted.  Whether or not I am accepted for a teaching position, I know that it will be due to God's plan and will...He is my main source of hope.  I know that my last entry was about my concern over graduation.  I think there might be a lack of clarity...what I was concerned about was the list of things I need to do in order for graduation...but, what is certain, is that I WILL graduate.    Venting with a fellow Christian friend....laughing with my roommates...typing this entry...has helped me to feel more peaceful.  Obviously, a great song and an interesting book has helped also.  I have been telling myself through this website, that I will review books, CDs....will do so as soon as I can.  but the peaceful way to see my goals in this area, is to realize that there is no urgency...that it will happen when it can.  speaking of urgency...I hope people aren't assuming that the war is now over, just because the US troops were able to take over portions of Baghdad.  according to rumsfeld...the war is not over yet, and the only thing that is for sure is that hussein is losing his power and hold over iraq.  we still need to wait and see what happens.  a more certain conclusion is needed to end the war.  May we all pray that things will not last too long...and I hope we all remember to keep the troops, their families...and iraqi civilians in our prayers also.

      I know that graduation is coming soon...the prospect of it consumes a portion of my mind that lingers and does not go away.  (hee hee!)   I am happy that things will finally come to a close, and that I will have accomplished what had seemed so difficult before.    I am not so happy, when I think about those I have said goodbye to already, and who I will say goodbye to soon.  ;(   but, because of graduation I have been getting mail periodically on what to do in order to get things finished up, such as a degree check (making sure all of my requirements are fulfilled), as well as filling out various different forms.  Aargh.  why is graduation so complicated?  anyway, other than that, I have fears about my physical and spiritual health right now, because of what the high level of stress did to me last quarter.  although, my academic classes are much better in terms of load of work, and leniency of professors, I am still concerned about the added stress from having to graduate on time.  I should probably pray for Him to calm me down.  I need to trust in the Lord.  how interesting of me to say such things after a prior entry about good looking male celebrities.  oh the irony.  so many mixed feelings.  I am so tired...and the things I did want to say, are now going to have to wait.  good night (morning).

         urlLink (Ivan Shaw's Blog)    Isn't this guy VERY good lookin'?  Recently,  I  have not been one to go nuts over a male actor/singer who happens to have a killer smile.  The guy has to actually have talent too.  But, this guy is a one-in-a-million, and his good lucks are to "die for".  I said it...I've embarrased myself...but there's no denying what's true.  hee hee.  who else have I gone crazy over?  hmmm....hugh grant, hugh jackman, brad pitt...and for the longest time, it was freddy prinze, jr.  after I watched "she's all that", with him being all cool and kick back and falling for the unpopular girl, and even though the movie itself was just another sappy teen movie...i felt that no other male was as attractive as freddy.  soon, that ended though when he started dating the actress from "buffy", sarah michelle gellar, and I knew that she had several things that i did not have: a TV show, blonde hair, and tons of money.  hee hee.  oh well.  there have been other actors and singers who have either amazed me through their looks or talents, but who did not hold my attention 24-7.  only occassionally.  for example, heath ledger was appealing after he starred in "10 things I hate about you".... but, i wasn't "nuts" over him.  just thought he was fairly attractive, and his ability to pull off that "bad boy" role in that movie helped.    someone that i truly admire for their talent...josh groban.  that man can sing!!!   and, he's only in his early 20's.  there's another dude named michael buble, who is really talented with jazz music.  quite a looker too, if do say so myself.  the list could go on...especially if i start on the older men, who have had amazing careers. there are those who are extremely talented, like tom hanks or robin williams.   then there are those who are very handsome and not known just for their talent, but on large scale for their looks, like tom cruise or george clooney.  finally, there are those who can pull off being both like mel gibson and denzel washington.   right now, music wise, the voices of josh groban and michael buble blow me away.  in the movies, hugh jackman who is extremely handsome (see "someone like you"), and hugh grant, who has done well in roles in such films as "bridget jones' diary'' and "about a boy" totally capture my attention.  maybe with move actors, its a foreign actor who really attracts me.  ivan shaw, who plays henry chin on "all my children" has now proven that his sparkling eyes can draw me to him.  i have yet to see whether he will prove his acting skills.  i should probably watch "all my children" tomorrow.  i am usually not a soap opera watcher, but for ivan...i can obviously make the time.  (wink wink).  now, there's my opinion on talented male actors and singers.  anyone agree/disagree?    (yvonne...i had already noticed ivan this weekend...but, we both think he's good lookin'.  you totally reminded me about him!  thanks! )

      you know what I just realized?  my last entry was about lifted burdens...and yet just now I just finish an entry about a whole new load of concerns I want to deal with...goals to achieve basically.  I just unknowingly, accumulated a whole group of goals for this quarter...goals that I can eventually see as burdens, if I do not use my time, energy, and resources wisely and efficiently.  I need to pray about that too.  wish me luck!  (note: for those of you who knew that i had given up CBS or a trip to Catalina for my LA Unified interview and want to know how it went--I feel that I did fairly well...I may have been weak with a couple of questions I had to answer during the last portion when it was a one-on-one session with an interviewer, but all the other parts such as a brief teaching session (i taught about civil rights!), group discussion, and writing sample were all done fairly well.  only time and God will let me know if this job is right for me.)

      guess what folks?  yes!  it is now my official and last quarter as an undergraduate college student.  These next 10 weeks of cramming, stress, and intense academics for my last four courses will represent the last end of an interesting phase of my life.  I'm not going to get philosophical about all of this, despite the fact that I can.  that's for another entry, and for a time when it's not past midnight.  I am taking four very interesting classes.  I am not looking forward to the work itself, as mentioned before, but I am looking forward to the material that will be covered in these classes.  first, I am taking a political science class, titled "Modern Political Ideologies".   As quoted from the syllabus..."With the collapse of communism, have we reached a state of ideological hegemony?  What do we even mean by 'hegemony' ? "   Now this class is tolerable...discussion over defined sets of varied political ideologies are more simpler for me to digest vs. last quarter when I had to analyze possible reasons for the origination of democracy in pre-modern Europe (I.e. think medieval times).  Next, I am taking a literature class on Asian Americans.  It's not strictly about literature, because we will also be viewing various films, and comparing them to the actual literary texts that they are based on.   basically, we get to figure out why the moviemakers switched things around when they made movie versions of famous books, such as "Joy Luck Club".  We even get to analyze the roles that Asian Americans played as a ethnic minority and as movie stars themselves, and how stereotypes developed and evolved.  phew.  deep, yet interesting stuff.  it's all context I can relate to, as a Korean American myself.  Next, I am taking a class titled, "American Musical Theater".  Although, there was some fear that I would not be accepted onto the class roster because of my non-theater major and minor, as well as lack of pre-requisite coursework, the professor decided to let people in.  I'm glad too.  We get to talk about Broadway musicals, listen to their music, analyze the history and structure of musicals, and even read their scripts.  all good stuff.  (Yvonne...you helped me become interested and hooked! hee hee...)  My last class is titled, "Law and Sex".  Basically, how sex, as a gender and as an action affects laws and cases.  Examples: rape, homosexuals' rights, incest, sexual harassment, women's rights...and the list goes on.    All of my professors are well read, experienced, and appear to be pleasant to deal with. (Thank you!  He's (God) answered my prayers!)  I think I'm relieved because I didn't have such professors last quarter.  And, we're going to leave that at that.  Other than that, I and a friend of mine (Susan...u know it baby!) have promised each other to help with an exercise routine.  We are going to be "walking" partners.  She walks everywhere (I think not having a car helps, by the way), and sometimes the distance that she travels can go up to 2 miles or so, when you count the distance traveled coming and going.  I also desire to utilize the bike that I have only ridden a total of four times...a new swimsuit I plan on buying because the one I have now sucks...and new athletic shoes (the "shoes" I have now are supposed to be skater shoes...and they are more bulky than comfy)  I also have a set of Tae-Bo tapes that I have stole from my bro, who never uses them.  I plan on shaking my booty!  I also have the option of using our college's gym ( that I pay a hefty sum for during every quarter through general fees) by perhaps doing some weightlifting (I need to also utilize the knowledge gained from my high school senior year course) and perhaps take a surfing class or two.  looks like a part time job is not gonna happen.  not too many want a senior who is going to take off pretty soon.  oh well, they don't know what they're missing out on.  that gives me time to watch the films for my Asian American literature class, study for the rest of my classes as well as the lit. course, and do everything else...like bible studies, hanging out with roomies and friends, and reading.  I have recently become somewhat of a bookworm again.  it will be hard to read anything extra what with school and all, but I do have at least 3 or 4 magazines I subscribe to also.  there is going to be only several TV shows that I make time for this quarter.   1) American Idol 2) Trading Spaces 3) While You Were Out  why?  I love cheering on those who have a great chance of winning on American Idol....and I love watching home makeover shows.  it gives me inspiration to succeed with my dreams, whether they be for my future (like those on American Idol), or for my future dream home.  I know.  some of you may wonder how I can make all these plans and be so positively minded when there is a war going on.  I also plan on keeping a daily prayer chart, as I try my absolute hardest to keep up with my daily devotionals.  Something I've been struggling with ever since I left a particular church.  (those who are close friends, know that story)    everything significant dealing with the war, will be at the top of my focus, as well as friends I have here in San Diego, in LA, out of town, and also my family.  those being currently prayed for:  Cathy;Sun;Angela;Alan;Amber;Lisa;Ryan;Elaine;Olivia;Julie M.;Susan;Sarah;my roommates;Hana;Yvonne;Elyse;my close extended family;immediate family  -I should probably add the family that I am a personal tutor for, as well as the church I attend and the group I am involved with (Coast Vineyard; Intervarsity)  anyone else need a quick prayer at least once?  let me know!  (leave a comment w/ your info and I'll respond!)  all I ask is that those who know the details, pray for my possible job with LA Unified, and my last quarter.    (next time, I will try to review recent cds I have purchased, as well a movie or a book)

      i was looking around to see if there was anything funny online about being Korean American, and I found alot of material @   urlLink You Know You're Korean If...   What I ended up doing was editing the content a bit to help it apply to me more.  Enjoy!    The most used furniture in your house never matches the wallpaper, the carpet, the decorations or any of the rest of the furniture.  You own a rice cooker or two.  You buy soy sauce by the gallon.  You parents own a liquor store, dry cleaner, or some kind of discount store.  You always have a box of Sapporo Ichiban ramyun or Yook-eh-jang. (popular brands of Asian ramen noodles)  You bring home all A's and one B, and your parents yell, "Why did you get a B?"  There is a 75% chance that you'll marry someone with the same last name .  White people always say, "Say something in Korean!"  When you were in junior high, you were either a nerd or a little "kkang ppeh" (i.e. gansta) wannabe.  Your parents say, "The reason why we came to America was so that you could get a good education, so go to Harvard."  You either have to be a doctor, lawyer, or some big-time business tycoon.  Your parents say, "1600 isn't that hard... just study."  (for SAT's)  No matter how well your parents speak English, they can't say "wood", "vacuum", or "kindergarten".  Your parent's idea of a social life is church.  You have a container full of Kim-Chee in your fridge right now.  Your parents are still shorter than you.  Your parents hand wash underwear.  Your parents think anything goes with rice.  The rice you eat can stick to anything.  You can't believe your parents could have conceived children.  You have naked baby pictures of you.  Your parents yell out your name REAL loud in public places.  Ramen is the fifth food group.  You want to translate for your parents when ordering fast food.  Your parents were ecstatic when the 88 Olympics were held in Korea.  You know how to do the "kimchi squat."  Your mom sings chan-son-gahs (hymns) while driving.  You have a million black leather bibles.  When you ask your parents if you can go out, they either reply "Why?" or "hmph" which means yes.  You have one of those silver kimchi-tongs with buckles on the sides.  You have a gazillion small containers in your fridge with different ban-chan inside.   You have the ability to tell the different Asians apart (i.e. Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese).  When your mom hears or watches something sad, she'll click her tongue a million times a minute.  Summer does not mean playtime to your parents. Summer means--bust out those workbooks so you can get ahead in class!  Kumon is a household word. (Ever heard of Sylvan?  Korean version=Kumon)  When guests are leaving your house, you have to stand outside your house saying bye to them, not to mention bowing a gazillion times.  You'll buy a shirt full price, and your parents will yell, "What! You could have bought that for $2 at the swap meet!"  You bring home straight As, and your parents say, "So? You're supposed to get that!"  Your parents always start long nagging sessions with "When I was in Korea...."  When you get a car, the only places you're supposed to go is school, the library, and maybe the grocery store to do grocery shopping for them.  When the doorbell rings, your parents get ALL suspicious and prohibit you from answering it. When they do answer it, they'll open the crack like 1 centimeter and speak through that. And if it's a salesperson, they'll slam the door screaming, "we no interest!"  You had to miss out on Saturday morning cartoons as a child, attending dreaded Korean School.  (I HAD TO FOR 6 YEARS!!)  While on long car trips, your parents will get bored, so they'll think about something that bugs them, and start bugging you. (i.e. Why is your room so messy! Why do you always fight with your siblings! Why do you always go out so much!)  You have a mini-van which your mom drives.  You'll be cooking kalbi outside, and neighbors will ask what the aroma is.  (kalbi = famous Korean BBQ ribs...yummy ! )

      I keep on seeing articles online about the death of over 15 illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America.  Supposedly, they suffocated and were dehydrated within the close proximity of a large truck.  What made it even worse is that the total number of immigrants was over 80.    I hear and read about these people, and my heart breaks.  It was easier for my parents and family to enter the United States, and yet I complain of my situation.  Despite some hardships that my family and I have been through over the years, God still provided the bare essentials in order to live a comfortable life.  I need to pray for these people, for the authorities, and for myself.  May we all look to God for guidance and comfort.

      I sent a very nice card to my mother on Wednesday, and I was told that she received it on Friday.  So, today when I called after I had gotten up from bed....she sounded happy to hear from me.  What did all of you out there do, for your mothers?   Other than it being Mother's Day...today is the last time I will have to study for a midterm at UCSD !!!!  I have that midterm on Tuesday, and then for the rest of the time I have a small quiz in my theater class and then...finals.   I also got to see Billy Graham last night.  It was Saturday night, which meant that it was concert for youth...as a result, Salvador, DC Talk, and Kirk Franklin came to perform.  one word---AWESOME.  Hearing Billy Graham speak was amazing in that it will probably be one of the last times he will publicly speak...something he is known throughout the world for.  I would love to read his biography one day...if there is one.  My friends and I were blessed through his message...and excited to see all the guest performers.     On Friday, I went to go eat Vietnamese food with Hana and some friends of hers.  Then we went to go sing karaoke.  how funny.   I bet you...if we had a dog with us that night...he would have howled.  (lol !)   What a busy and interesting weekend.  time to go catch up and study.  wish me luck!

      Water: 1.  75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated. 2.  In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger. 3.  Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%. 4.  One glass of water will shut down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a U-Washington research. 5.  Lack of water is the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue. 6.  Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers. 7.  A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page. 8.  Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to develop bladder cancer. Are you drinking the amount of water you should every day?  Coke: 1.  In many states (in the USA) the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the trunk to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 2.  You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two days. 3.  To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl and let the "real thing" sit for one hour, then flush clean. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous china. 4.  To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a rumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola. 5.  To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 6.  To loosen a rusted bolt: Apply a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes. 7.  To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan, wrap the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is finished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for scrumptious brown gravy. 8.  To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, and run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your windshield.  FYI: 1.  The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. Phosphoric acid also leaches calcium from bones and is a major contributor to the rising increase in osteoporosis. 2.  To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous material placards reversed for highly corrosive materials. 3.  The distributors of coke have been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years!

      Hey y'all...  I know that I have no excuse for not doing a lot of things...  Studying, looking for that perfect job, staying dedicated to activities related with religion, keeping in touch with everyone....   aargh.  It's been crazy trying to figure out what to do as I prepare myself to leave San Diego after graduation.  In the meantime, I am going nuts with just midterms, and the fact that I have to write two papers, and take two exams.  Please I beg you.  Make it all stop.  I'm glad that one paper has been turned in already and as I am typing this now...I should be working on another.  How in the world am I going to prove the influence the European operetta has made on "South "Pacific"?  aaaaaaahhhhhhhh..................!  I know, I know.  "Julie you had the whole weekend to start on this."  "Julie don't worry...you'll do ok"....."Julie you had two to three weeks to start on this"..."Julie you worry too much"  I just want it to be all over.  unlike others that I know who have taken quarters off to rest...I unwisely decided to stick to it and go all the way through despite my bouts of intense depression last year.  yes, I know.  I am a strong woman.  if I can do the above...I can last one month more, right?  maybe the fact that I have not had a church or bible study that has helped me realize the lack of reality depression can feed you....has made me want to be on my own and not involve myself in anything.  I am quite calm and relaxed now, and I am not depressed any longer.  however, unlike in high school, when my church and bible studies helped me see with such comforting clarity how much God loved me....I have not been able to see as clearly throughout college....  God has been on the back burner.  ugh.  I suck.  I need a long-deserved break.  away from stress causes....away from those who cause stress....  I need to be with my family who although nag...love me no matter what.   and, I need to be back in a religious setting where I can see God with such clarity it brings so much strength and intuition.  I miss that church...and I miss being so excited to go to a bible study.   and, I am NOT  going to miss staying up to write papers or study for exams.  wish me luck....

        And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives Where we're gonna be when we turn 25 I keep thinking times will never change Keep on thinking things will always be the same But when we leave this year we won't be coming back No more hanging out cause we're on a different track And if you got something that you need to say You better say it right now cause you don't have another day Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down These memories are playing like a film without sound And I keep thinking of that night in June  I didn't know much of love But it came too soon And there was me and you And then we got real cool Stay at home talking on the telephone with me We'd get so excited, we'd get so scared Laughing at our selves thinking life's not fair And this is how it feels  1 - As we go on      We remember      All the times we      Had together      And as our lives change      Come whatever      We will still be      Friends Forever  So if we get the big jobs And we make the big money When we look back now Will our jokes still be funny? Will we still remember everything we learned in school? Still be trying to break every single rule Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man? Can we ever find a job that won't interfere with a tan? I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye Keep on thinking it's a time to fly And this is how it feels  Repeat 1  La, la, la, la… Yeah, yeah, yeah La, la, la, la… We will still be friends forever  Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now? Can we survive it out there? Can we make it somehow? I guess I thought that this would never end And suddenly it's like we're women and men Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round? Will these memories fade when I leave this town I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye Keep on thinking it's a time to fly  Repeat 1 (3x)

      It makes me so mad that so many of us here complain of bad cafeteria food, and unluxurious things....when I read about the prison camps of NORTH KOREA.  I won't go into detail...if any of you want to know more, and do not mind reading about graphic details...go to urlLink  The Chosun Journal .  I was bored when I was writing my last paper for the year ( I have two more exams now)...and, I remembered hearing news about how they're going to start taking US troops south of the 38th parallel in Korea.  So,  I was looking around online, and found articles about NK defectors/refugees...and their stories.  One woman couldn't keep herself from crying...she was treated like an ANIMAL.  Her only food is only one corn cake....the size of a large cookie...and a cup of salty water....  I am so lucky to have grown up in the US.  Yes, I've been through more trials than the average Asian American college student...But I am blessed to be an US citizen.  For any of you out there who deny what the North is doing...or who don't think the issue is important enough....  think about this.  do u really think hitler and the holocaust was something we should have denied or ignored?  this angers me.  it doesn't matter about ethnicity or culture now.  what matters is that many (400.000+) people are dying and worked like dogs.  and a good majority of those people are CHRISTIANS.  MAY THE LORD WATCH OVER THEM... I really hope we can see their rescue one of these days.  and, i don' t care if i get hate mail, or criticism.  from now on, i officially denounce the government of North Korea.

      Yesterday, Thursday June 5, 2003, was my LAST DAY of undergraduate classes @ UC San Diego.    wow.   I have four classes, but my second and third classes of the day, are the only classes during which I do my best to pay attention and scribble down notes.  So, in my third class, which is titled, "American Musical Theatre", we were discussing Stephen Sondheim (lyricist for "West Side Story").  In the words of my professor, Steven Adler, "Sondheim is known for his dramatically astute songs."   What does that mean you ask?   He simplified that by saying, "He was criticized for being too intellectual and not being emotional and gutsy enough for Broadway.." (just try to compare Sondheim with Rogers and Hammerstein, and you'll know what that really means!)  He quoted Sondheim, who had responded by saying,  "I believe in sentiment, and not in being sentimental."   Therefore, in other words, it is an issue of deep emotion vs. being what my professor so comically put-- "schmaltzy"  (orig. Yiddish word for "chicken fat" LOL! but what now means anything that is too heavy, syrupy, and thick...)  Why do I refer to all this you also ask?  Well, last night was an incredible 3.5 hours of sentiment.  I attended the last large group meeting of Intervarsity Christian Fellowship @ UC San Diego...and I did tear up in the beginning...and I was so joyful and happy at the end.    For those of you who know me well, and who see me occasionally, it is rare for me to be so-o happy, AND show it at the same time.  I am so-o annoyingly shy, unconfident, and reserved.  There are only a few friends, who have truly seen the REAL me, and not been completely shocked or confused.  Even last night, it was hard for me.  All the seniors, and I mean ALL, had to go up in front of everyone and share something inspirational.  So of course, not expecting that I would go, I did not prepare anything in advance.  But, I had to go too.  And the time that was passing, seemed like forever...my heart would gradually increase its speed of beats...and I would slowly feel the knots in my stomach tighten.    "What do I say?  Should I keep it brief and to the point?  Does God want me to share with everyone about my epilepsy?  Should I mention those who have really been there for me?  Would a Bible verse help?  Should I be serious or funny?"    SHOULDA, COULDA, WOULDA!!!!  Finally, it was my turn.  I slowly walked up to the microphone while nervously smiling.  A small group of people cheered for me as I shuffled to the front.  A pair of girls from my small group waved enthusiastically...while a guy shouted, "Hi, Julie!".    So, I will share with you what I exactly said, as best as I can remember it (I might edit it for grammar, etc.  what else is new?).  Then, I'll share what I knew deep down I  could have and should have  said.  "There are two sentences that have been going on and on and over and over again in my head tonight.  They are  God never gives up  and  It's better late than never.   I feel like with Intervarsity, I can say that it's better late than never, because I joined this year as a senior.  There are so many of you as I look at all of you, who I wish I had known, or gotten to know better.  I know too, that sometimes I could have gotten to know you, but I hesitated or was too scared.  For those of you who know me better, you know that I have a low self esteem problem, and I tend to assume the worst.  So, for the people that I did get to know it was great.  Even if it was just a smile, it was such a blessing to me.  I just wish I had more time.   (And then, the nerd that I am, this is what I said next) What was the other phrase?  (As I nervously scratched my head...) Oh yeah!  God never gave up on me.  There were times when I didn't feel like coming to IV (Intervarsity), and God would say, ' Uh uh! Sister, you better be going! ' (I made people laugh with that one!)  and He helped me with other things too, in my life.  Things weren't easy for me, but He never gave up.  He's still working on me now, and I know He will do the same for you.  That's what I leave you with.  Thank you."  Okay, so that's what I ended up saying.  What a fart, I am!  I could have said so-o much more, and still kept it brief.  But, I knew I wasn't ready to vocally share what I had been praying to God about these past few days, as I finished my last week at UCSD.    This week, even though I KNEW I needed to start concentrating on studying for my finals, I was actually praying to God whenever I began to get reflective about my college years. (which was often)  Instead of feeling nostalgia and "SENTIMENTAL" about my past four years, about friends, trips, professors, roommates, and school....I started feeling deep SENTIMENT for these past four years.  I finally started to realize why college had been so difficult...and I'm not talking about just my classes and academic workload (that was pretty hard too though!)  This is what I would have said, if I hadn't been so scared, if I had no time limits, and if I had been much closer with Intervarsity. A lot of it is actually quite serious, and not entertaining or funny either.  Maybe that's why. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  God has certainly stretched me.  He has caused me to change.   James 1:2-4 has become a symbol of that.   "Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."   You may wonder what represents "trials of many kinds" when it comes to my time in college.  I have a problem with low confidence and low self-esteem, and it keeps me from befriending many wonderful people who either misunderstand me and think I am either pushing you away because I don't like you (for females) or because I do like you and I'm shy (romantically-for males!).  I wish I could be myself around everyone.  I am enthusiastic, goofy, and happy.  I am eager to share life with those who love God as much or even more than I do.  Only several people (count it! probably less than five!)  have seen how I truly am.  Usually, I am quiet and reserved around those I either don't know, don't trust, or those I hesitate to trust.  I have been depressed...even to the point that I have had suicidal thoughts that I know now, I never ever want to have ever again.   I have a chronic illness--epilepsy, that I hide from everyone because I have lost friends, confidence, and certain everyday liberties to it.  I have struggled to make ends meet financially and on my own...and it has caused for a relationship with a past non-Christian roommate to deteriorate, fall,  and never come back up again.  I have a younger brother who struggles with becoming a dependable, responsible, and mature individual, especially now that he's graduated from high school, and needs to become more independent.  I find it impossible to share about my brother unless the other person has dealt with the same issue through a family member also, or unless I trust you COMPLETELY.  There's more to my brother...but it is just way too personal, and in my family's point of view I've already shared way too much here.  All I can say is that, I was very unhappy, miserable, and sad when I went home during high school.   I could make this "list" more longer, and I've already done what others may see as "making you feel sorry for me".    That's not my intention at all.  I DON'T want people to feel sorry for me, as a way for me to support my frail self-esteem.  I am sharing all these very personal and not-so-happy parts of my life here on this website because I want to show you all what God has revealed to me through it all.  I can look back and still tear up and still feel hurt, but I can make the long journey that I have already started towards emotional and spiritual healing.  God has brought all these trials in my life to make me a COMPLETE PERSON, "not lacking in anything".  God has stripped away my "walls" that I had so anxiously put up during my adolescence.  My innocence, my naivete, and my false sense of protection has been taken away.  He has breaken down the barriers I myself had put up to protect myself from being hurt again.  He wanted me to go through trials throughout college depending on Him ALONE.  I failed miserably many times.  But, I can say that as I look back on my college years, I have become someone who tries to learn something out of every conflict or situation.  Even if I were to have a conflict, I like to apply the corny phrase, "It takes two to tango!"  Except for a few select people, most others I interact with, have seen an overall change in me.  My confidence has grown.  Therefore, after college graduation and on, I will try to look at everything through His eyes, and I will look at things objectively.  I still have a LONG way to go.  I should not put up my "protection mode"....my bad habits of paranoia, assumptions that anything negative automatically applies to me, worrying about how others see me.  Basically, various nervous habits to protect myself.    God's love for me should be more than enough...it should be the ONLY thing that makes me feel safe and happy.  May I realize the deep sentiment in my relationship with God...it should be the one thing I strive to excel in...it should not be something I place on the "back burner".

      Hello everyone!  It has been some time since I wrote a "real" entry!  You know, the kind where I display my thoughts, my emotions, and update y'all on what's been going on my life...  So, first I will update you on how I'm doing.  One thing--I decided against the second blog.  I have spent much time, effort, and energy as well as a small sum of $$$ to make THIS website one that people would be willing to visit.  Having a second blog would only add stress and work.  oh well.    Moving on, exactly two weeks from now (which will go by so-o fast!)  I will have graduated  COLLEGE  !!!   I'm so excited and happy...it's true what some people have been saying to me recently...  It is much easier to enter college here in the U.S. than in Korea (think SAT's only several times harder and twice as much !), but it is much, much harder here in the U.S. to actually stick it out and graduate from college.    And, yes!  I have achieved this much.  Hallelujah!  I have many plans for myself as I give myself at least a month or so to rest.  For the two weeks I am here in San Diego, I plan on making the beach a close friend...as well giving myself plenty of time to explore downtown La Jolla and San Diego.  I love the idea of going to areas where there is much to see and visit...and just taking my time.  (sigh)  I also plan on watching the 10 or so DVD's I have bought over the past two years.  I have both Harry Potter films...the first Lord of the Rings film, as well as others ranging from Ocean's 11 to My Fair Lady.  I also want to rent the movie version of all the musicals I have either studied this quarter or want to watch: Showboat, Oklahoma, Guys and Dolls, West Side Story, etc.  I know that dreaming and hoping is always nice...  Back to reality.  FINALS.  ew.  That is going to be next week...not the week that is starting tomorrow.  I have two papers, one being a creative piece I need to do, that I will attempt to use The Joy Luck Club as material to form ideas for a musical.  Everything else is pretty much self-explanatory.  Wish me luck !  Other things I need to do is rent a cap and gown, make sure my name is listed right with my college, and PACK!   I am also trying to keep myself in prayer as such concepts as a career, future plans for graduate school, and so forth are of concern.  It's  quite late.  Too bad...I wanted to do a better entry about what is going on spiritually with God and I.  Let me just say for now that, He is challenging me to put  everything  else aside in order to get more closer to Him.  I've been putting Him on the "back burner".  As a side note, I have been getting hooked on Korean pop music, ever since I discovered the girl group named Big Mama. (just think looks = Queen Latifah/ voice = Whitney Houston at her best)   Here's a site that has ALL  the info on Korean pop:  urlLink Solid 007: Korean Pop .  Other than that, time to sleep....(yay!)

      I got a new job !  The Law Offices of Michael K. Lee 3055 Wilshire Blvd. 12th floor Los Angeles, CA. 90010     I just finished typing up a letter for my boss.  I got here about 15 minutes early because my dad says LA traffic stinks, so better early than too late.  So, now I have to wait until something pops up, like a phone call, a client, or the lawyer himself.   What's a little weird is that the other secretaries who were here yesterday aren't here at the same time today.  It's 9 am on a Tuesday.  Am I the only one who comes in everyday?   SO, I'm clearly bored, and I know you would probably want to know what my new job is like anyways....  Yesterday was my first day, and based on my own experience and what the other secretaries told me, my boss is laid-back and easier to work with than some of the other lawyers.  He was totally cool about showing me how to use different machines and how to do different tasks.  My dad says that that's natural....my dad's words/actions exactly--"It's the first day.  If he needs to still tell you after several times than he's gonna think you're weird" (picture my dad then swirling his finger near his right ear)  Moving on, other than that I spent most of the time in front of the computer filling out legal paperwork for my boss, answering phone calls, making phone calls, typing letters, and I also did some basic cleaning and organization because he hasn't had someone for a couple of months and he just moved to another office too.  (that last one wasn't too hard for me, eh?  cleaning = something Julie does 24/7  lol !!! )  my boss doesn't have a scheduled appointment until 11 am. and now it is exactly 9:10 am.  sigh.  I was warned by my high school friend and by my boss that this would happen from time to time with an office job---I may just end up having nothing to do!

      Wow!  It's already towards the end of July.  I feel like the time from my last set of finals in early June until now has totally flown by.    I've finally settled down here, in Los Angeles, now that I am living with the 'rents again.  I love 'em with all my heart, but I don't know if I can be nice and patient with their nagging anymore (despite their good and loving intentions).  My brother just expects me to pick up where I left off before I left for college, when I cooked meals for him and did his laundry.  That fart!   He even went through my DVDs and CDs today, and didn't even bother calling and asking me if he could use any of them.  Normally, it wouldn't bother me, but he's been known to misuse items or sell things for $$$ too.  Today, was the last of a group of interviews that I've had to attend this and last week.  It's so hectic whenever I have to go to one.  I have to make sure to leave an hour before, and I have to dress nicely.  Aargh.   Sometimes, whenever I'm wearing my good shoes and stuffy slacks and blouses, I really want to just throw on my shorts and pull my hair off my face.  Double aargh.   I have to leave early for my interviews because traffic in LA is SOO-O BAD!  What normally should take 15-20 minutes takes double the time when there's rush hour or normal LA traffic.  I've gone to four law firms, an escrow office, and the corporate office for Forever 21.  So far, the only ones who seem to think I'm worthy enough for a 2nd (yes, a 2nd!!!) interview, are the places I went to today: the last law firm I went to, and Forever 21.  I spent the majority of the day, driving around and making sure I got there early enough.  Triple aargh.  If I get hired with Forever 21, I will work in their Travel Dept, where I help with travel accommodations and expenses as well as a ton of paperwork, for the employees and executives who travel out of state for new openings and/or renovations.  If I get hired with the law firm of Richard Hoffman, (who's connected to the Korean community through his Korean wife, and who also has a great reputation) I will basically start from the bottom and work my way up.  I will be the errand "girl" as well as the file clerk.  The lady who interviewed me said it was cuz of my lack of experience within a law firm.    Of course, I don't have solid experience because I was too busy trying to survive and cover my own butt throughout college.    Oh well.  To be honest,  I wasn't expecting to become the next best paralegal and personal assistant to the main lawyer himself right away.  I knew I had to do some grunt work in order to work my way up to a position of true accomplishment.  I really should take what I told the interviewer to heart: "Every little bit counts".  She basically implied that: "Everyone working is vital to the flow of success within the office".  What else has been a struggle for me in regards to the interviews, is how many times I've had to speak in Korean during the interviews.  I don't like that I can't describe or convey myself at my best when I speak Korean.  I struggle just to be grammatically correct and to say the right words for what I want to say.   Okay, okay.  Enough complaining for Julie.  I've already sent a quick prayer up since last week, promising God that I'd leave this in His hands.  I have to have faith that He'll send me where He wants me to be.  That's the BEST place for me to be.  I'll "say" a prayer now!  Lord, I pray that You will send me to the job that best fits my role and position that I must fulfill in order to do Your will.  I hope that wherever I go, that I will find wonderful sisters and brothers who sincerely love and worship You.  I know that I must put You at the top of all my hopes and desires, and may I do so through my pursuit of a job.    I also pray that I will have enough courage to go back to my church.  I've been scared to go, because I'm afraid all the changes that have happened will make it so that I cannot sincerely feel and experience what I did during high school.  I really need to focus on the existence of Your presence and the Holy Spirit's power instead.  Please help me to keep all of this close to my heart and ingrained within my mind.  Thank you!   Ahh.  That feels better.  I express myself so much more intelligently and clearly when I write the words out.    And, now all of you know what has been on my mind and heart since I've started to settle down here in LA.  Other than finding a job and trying to get myself to go back to my church,  I've hung out with some high school friends, and started early morning walks.  Part of the reason why I've been forced to wake up at 6 am Monday through Saturday and go to a nearby park and walk a mile or so, is because of my father.  He really wants to see me at my best, in regards to my health.  He thinks that my health was becoming poorer throughout spring quarter because of the lack of exercise and healthy food.  The other reason is because I feel that this will help me wake up earlier for a new job, summer school, and I also agree with my dad, but he's just more extreme in how he executes it.  Time to go eat dinner.  I'm actually eating before 8 pm.  In San Diego, my schedule stunk.   I will try to write more entries like this more often.  I've been busy and lazy.  Sowee!  Now that I finally have high-speed internet...I have less of an excuse not to contribute to this site!

         One thing I didn't have down in San Diego, was a scanner.  I finally was able to scan some pictures that I liked, and I decided to put this one on this page, because it helps remind me of the beautiful beaches in San Diego.  One thing I miss about San Diego, is the cleaner air and amazing views.    I took this picture while I was on the train, so it's a little blurred.  Doesn't it look cool like that anyways?

      First, before I type an entry about how I personally am doing and have been...  All of y'all need to find out about this...  JERRY SPRINGER HAS APPLIED TO RUN FOR THE US SENATE! (read this  urlLink article  )  All I have to say is that, with Reagan starting things off by running as a former entertainer (I'm not saying he didn't do a good job, necessarily), and with Jesse Ventura being governor....  I believe it is easier to assume that his success at becoming a candidate is more probable.   I personally was shocked.  What about you?

      Hello all!  I know it's been at least a week or two since I've bothered to put anything of substance here.    First, I participated in my graduation ceremony on 6/15.  Some friends showed up unexpectedly (thanks Hana, Yvonne, and Elyse!)  and I had some lovely family members come too.  Then, I spent a couple of weeks in San Diego, figuring out $$$ issues, trying to spend time with Hana and IV friends...and getting the new Harry Potter book. (yay!)  Finally, I am now back in LA with my parents, trying to see if I can get a part time job for the summer while finally attempting to get my driver's license.  I am also going to take an extra class @ UCLA during August, and see if I can get a job as an Administraitve Assistant or Executive Assistant within a law firm/well established office.  My father has suggested an escrow office, because fluency in English and fast typing is needed.    As soon as my family decides to get fast internet or not....I will figure out a way to update this blog more regularly.  In the meantime...I am going to rest from the past very busy four years.  phew.

      It has been too long since I've sat down and typed out a "real" entry.  The kind where I relay to y'all about how I'm doing...what I've been doing...etc.   Every single time I tried, it was at work, and my boss would show up unexpectedly with work for me to do...and the window I had opened on the computer would just be minimized and untouched until it was 5 minutes 'till it was time for me to leave.   lol !  guess what?  i'm technically telling myself to get several pages typed tonight...I have a 15 page paper due on Thursday, and on Tuesday and Wednesday I have work and class to go to.  So, unlike typical UCSD days, when I would start such a paper the night before...I am attempting to give myself a few more days.  and...yes, you guessed right.  I came here instead to procrastinate as usual.   hee hee !!!   tomorrow's labor day, and i know my mother is going to want to head to the beach or do something spontaneous (typical of my mom)...but julie will have to blast her celine dion (for some odd reason...i've been in the mood to listen to her lately) and type away about the lovely middle east.  i have to prove why  I, Julie Row,  think that the US has shifted their foreign policy towards the Middle East after Sept. 11.   If I've been anything but stupid lately...all I had to do is watch the news on television to help myself write this paper.  Hopefully, it will be easier than back in the day to write such a long paper.  argh.  it still sucks to have to write one.  why couldn't he (the prof) be happy with just the final? or a midterm?  take the exam..and get it over with all in one shot!  what makes this paper interesting is that, not only i am stuck taking summer school so that i can finish some remaining units up for my diploma (despite the fact that i walked and all in june)...  i am also taking this class @ UCLA.  Let me tell you...people are not exaggerating when they say that it is CROWDED over there.  oh boy.  after driving through several times to get to class...you start noticing the differences.  ucsd was much more peaceful, spread out, and kick back.  and, that goes for how the students were too...  what i do like about ucla is that it has a rich history...you can tell just by looking at the buildings...the kind of buildings i pictured on a east coast ivy league school are here at ucla...standing tall and proud.  ;)   other than that, i've been learning how to drive and working at the law office i mentioned in an earlier entry this month (august).  jeez, if i were to tell you about how many close calls and honks i've had while driving...i would so-o not be surprised if y'all laughed ur butts off.  seriously, after i get out of the car and think about how i drive while in it...it's hilarious how nervous and non-confident i am.    yes, i know.  for those of you who know me when i am dealing with something new and/or unfamiliar, it doesn't surprise you that i'm like this with driving.  but honestly, for those of you know me well, you also know that i've come a LONG  way from my high school days, when i would cry and wail about EVERYTHING.  same goes for work.    i consider myself EXTREMELY lucky to have been hired by my boss, and i know alot had to do with timing and situation.  i had a tough week last week, and i came close to being my ole' self...miss queen of paranoia!!!!  all i can say is that i need to be more confident.  being more confident, will give me more confidence in not just my self-esteem and handling tough situations, but it will give me better skills in determining what, when, how, and where i should do things within the office.  other than that, working for my boss has been pretty good.  he's fair, kick back, and intelligent.  everyone agrees that he's one of the more better employers to work for.    so, for the daily details of my life...you now have the gist of what has been going on.  maybe that's why i haven't come on here.  i haven't had much to complain about...unless you all think i can count having an annoying bro as something to share about?  ;)   hee hee.    as for my relationship with God...i've shamelessly and foolishly put it on hold.  i have some things to think about...and i'm not even sure which church to go to/try out.  maybe all of that's for another entry, eh?    have a good night!

      Currently, I am 50 minutes away from finishing my day here at the office...and, my neck is killing me.  that is why my mood is "bruised"...cuz it feels like someone took my neck and twisted it with their bare hands !  anyways, when i go home, eat dinner, and then take a shower....i am going to possibly add more.    i felt like venting for now.

      ok, i know i've been wanting to write an entry about how my new job is (busy but good)...how my last class at UCLA for its summer school is (B-O-R-I-N-G!), and how living with the folks and hanging out with high school buds have been (#1-sigh and groan; #2-relaxing and fun)...but y'll HAVE to read the following...it's HILARIOUS! ;p  (since i have 5-10 minutes until my lunch break is over...and because one my most awesome friends sent this to me (i.e. Hana) hee hee! )   1)  BEHIND EVERY SUCCESSFUL WOMAN IS HERSELF  $%#@ straight!  every woman for herself!  when it comes to being goregous, smart, successful, AND sexy...no one else helped us!    2) OH MY GOSH, I THINK I'M BECOMING THE MAN I WANTED TO MARRY!  there is no way on this earth, i am going to marry/date/admire a guy who is the perfect epitome of my ideals and dreams.  sweet, charming, handsome, sensitive, CHRISTIAN, independent, confident but not egotistical....   YEAH RIGHT!    3) GINGER ROGERS DID EVERYTHING FRED ASTAIRE DID, BUT SHE DID IT BACKWARDS AND IN HIGH HEELS  yeah baby!  we women know how to walk the walk, talk the talk, and strut our stuff with heels that are AT LEAST 3 inches tall.   4) A WOMAN IS LIKE A TEA BAG... YOU DON'T KNOW HOW STRONG SHE IS UNTIL YOU PUT HER IN HOT WATER  it's all about knowing how to handle things when things get tough.  who else can do it better?  we've got the know-how, the calm temperament, the quickness of the brain, and ease of movement, to look good while we get ourselves out of tougher situatiions!   5) I HAVE YET TO HEAR A MAN ASK FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO COMBINE MARRIAGE AND A CAREER  and how!  only us, as young, beautiful, and successful woman can balance a great job and a wonderful married life...and do it better than anyone else!    6) SO MANY MEN, SO FEW WHO CAN AFFORD ME  when i think about ALL the things i truly would enjoy...(i'm not just talking materially)....this is SO-O true.   7) COFFEE, CHOCOLATE, MEN. SOME THINGS ARE JUST BETTER RICH  PUH-LEAZ!  who ever heard of watered down coffee...white chocolate...and desperate men as being those who had women craving after them?    8) DON'T TREAT ME ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU WOULD THE QUEEN  E-X-A-C-T-L-Y.  it's all about being the queen of your own home.    9) I'M OUT OF ESTROGEN AND I HAVE A GUN  hmm...this hasn't happened to me quite yet (i.e. menopause).  maybe when it does...i can use it. ;)    10) WARNING: I HAVE AN ATTITUDE AND I KNOW HOW TO USE IT  woo hoo!  it's all about letting even the men in your family know that you're not someone they can mess with!  trust me--my brother "thinks" i'm being mean?  hmmph.  maybe i should blame it on PMS?  lol !    11) OF COURSE I DON'T LOOK BUSY...... I DID IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME  i know most women would apply this to issues that are on the borderline (ex. SEX),  but i'd like to apply this to being super neat, organized, and when i blog online.    12) DO NOT START WITH ME. YOU WILL NOT WIN  when it comes to men as well as those trying to tell me stop shopping....so true.    13) I CAN BE ONE OF THOSE BAD THINGS THAT HAPPENS TO BAD PEOPLE  hahaha!  to all those evil roommates....stuffy professors...ex-friends who thought they were better than me....what else can i say?    14) HOW CAN I MISS YOU IF YOU WON'T GO AWAY?  i had a friend who had "someone" who wouldn't leave her alone.  i so would have liked her to use this one.  he would have so-o gotten the hint. (wink, wink)    15) DON'T UPSET ME! I'M RUNNING OUT OF PLACES TO HIDE THE BODIES  i don't know if i would go this far...but like i said...with some of my evil roomies from junior year...it would be easy to think about possibities!   And last but not least:   IF YOU WANT BREAKFAST IN BED, SLEEP IN THE KITCHEN  especially for those guys who have never cooked, cleaned, or picked up after themselves....you need to hear this one!   i hope i didn't seem TOO angry and bitter.  it's all about having a great sense of humor when: i have a cold, i've been working full time for the past 2 weeks (when i was totally kickin' it b4), i had to sleep thru summer school, and wait at a smelly and crowded DMV 4 2 hours yesterday.    does it surprise you now?  ;P

      Hello! The first full week of August is approaching, as it is nearing midnight.  I had an interesting yet good first week of work at my new place of employment, as detailed in my last entry.  Usually, whenever a past job has not worked out, in the beginning, I can get a bad vibe about something--my boss, the atmosphere, the hours, etc.  However, other than the fact that it may get a little boring from time to time...this new job is not bad.  I can't say much...maybe I'll do that tomorrow when I get a break.   Oh well...had a good weekend relaxing and spending time with friends.  Wish me luck on this next week...I'm also starting summer school @ UCLA and trying to take the permit test for driving.  :)

      I'm considering the possibility of starting my xanga blog again.  I need a place for general thoughts....and a place where I can focus on my spiritual life.  I'm gonna give myself a few days and decide.   in the meantime, for any of you who want to take a peek at what it looks like:    urlLink Xanga Blog - Jewels3281    Other than that, my back feels 95% better.  I still have slight pain in the lower back, which I'm sure will disappear within several days.  I've also been continuing my full-time job @ the law firm in the mid-Wilshire region of Los Angeles.    When I was at the beach yesterday, I was envisioning the perfect apartment (because my bro is driving me nuts), and I would love to live right by the beach in my own little apartment, and decorate it.  I wouldn't mind a cool roommate either, like my friend Hana or people from UCSD Intervarsity.  I really missed the clean and fresh air of the San Diego beaches, and when I went to the beach yesterday, it reminded me of where I used to be all the time during college.  I kinda miss it...I miss being out on my own, and being left alone too.   oh well... I am aiming to obtain my own space/room/apt. soon.  It WILL happen.  in the meantime, i am trying to work hard here @ work.  wish me luck!

      Hello all!  Sorry for taking too long to update. I'll explain below...  On Friday, the 12th, I injured my back, and ever since, due to what a chiropractor has called "inflammation and muscle spasms", I find most basic movements that involve my back to be substantially difficult.    I don't mean to complain...I do too much of it ordinarily.  But, this condition, has helped me to think about how much my back involves so many things I normally overlooked...  turning over in my sleep, going to the bathroom, standing up from sitting down, exiting a car...etc, etc.   Instead of thinking, "woe is me!" .... deep down i realized how i've been blessed by having two strong legs to walk... and i could go on.     i'm just glad this is temporary.  the doctor told me that if it had spread to my legs...the situation would have been much more critical.  (phew)  I am quietly and earnestly thanking God for helping me realize how much my health is valuable to me.  As soon as my back heals--Julie Row will sincerely try to lose weight!!!  Exercise, healthy eating...will be possible options.  I have already improved from my time in college when late night-snacking and watching movies was the norm.  Moving on...  i really don't care if all of y'all think i'm a huge NERD.   why?  because for the past couple of months, i've been spending my free time (i.e. the weekend) with my FAMILY...  on saturdays, i'll go and visit my paternal grandmother with my uncle and father.  the four of us will grab a quick and tasty Korean food lunch and then look around in Koreatown.  The ONE reason why i insist on going with my relatives is because of my grandma.  I have inherited much of her physical appearance as well as her personality.  And, deep down, I have this feeling that I MUST cherish the time I have with her now.    So, I spend alot of time with her.  most of all, I admire her inner strength.  If it weren't for my grandma's preseverance and dedication, her two sons (my uncle and father) would not have endured the Korean War and its aftermath the way that they did.  Both have matured into men of hard work, determination, and confidence.  Although, there are many times, when my father may be a typical father...spending time away at college and coming back recently has helped me to see a clearer and bigger picture.  I can understand his true purpose more and more everyday.   Other than all that, I have been working full time at my law office job.  I've also finsished reading the two books about Korean American life by Helie Lee.    It feels weird, not having to worry about readings for college classes, midterms, and finals.     One last note:   This last Saturday, when I spent time with my family, my uncle was in a generous mood and bought me two CDS.  They are the soundtracks to two Korean dramas titled, "Yellow Handkerchief" and "Bodyguard".  I am now becoming more interested in Korean culture.  I find myself watching such dramas, and now I am also buying their soundtracks.  In addition there are a select few among the many artists within the Korean pop genre that I admire.     Oh my goodness!  Julie is actually interested in Korean entertainment...something she had considered to be a taboo back in her adolescent years!!!  lol !!!   I was thinking about it over the weekend, and I consider my interest in Korean culture to be symbolic of my eventual embrace of my ancestors' culture and identity.  Cool stuff, huh?  ;P

      I am now trying my best to update on this website as often as possible.  Yes, I know that it is now almost a week, since the last entry.  I did not update after last Monday, because of the paper I was complaining about (which I finished on time barely), and because I did not have the energy.    The rest of the week, all I did was go to work.  I've been trying to not be so distracted...and actually do a better job.  I think I did ok towards the beginning of the week, but by the time I had turned in the paper, or was close to...I was too stressed and preoccupied to keep it up as much.  Maybe I'll do it either during or after this week.  I'll be screaming for joy on Thursday when I finally finish by finishing the final exam.  A 15 page paper can really kill one's energy and enthusiasm.  Especially if it's for a class that I realized wasn't interesting when I went to the FIRST lecture.  lol !!!  Anyhoo, I am now at the library.  I am "technically" supposed to be here to study for the final now.  And, yes as always, I am procrastinating AGAIN.  Yesterday, I came here too, for the same reason.  I studied for a good 2 hours...although I had been here for 3.  I had checked out some good books I intend on reading after this final, and I was also looking at their movie collection. (Mostly older, already watched stuff)  Y'all wanna know what I checked out?     Roots  by Alex Haley  The Bonesetter's Daughter  by Amy Tan  Still Life with Rice  by Helie Lee  In the Absence of the Sun  by Helie Lee  East of Eden  by John Steinbeck  Yes, I have become somewhat of the bookworm nerd that I was in my preteen and adolescence years.  Then, when I 'stepped' into my teen years, a CD obsession took over.  I really enjoy reading Asian American literature, as well as well-known, best-selling fiction.  I have yet to read "The Nanny Diaries", Hilary Clinton's new bio, and ....I forgot!  I also enjoy reading Christian literature...like C.S. Lewis, and "The Purpose-Driven Life".   After eating lunch today and getting out of the house (let's just say that I cannot put up w/my bro as patiently as my 'rents), I am now here.  I have also been continuing to drive.  I have now attempted to drive on the freeway...the 5 freeway on a Sunday is nice--NO traffic.  I still suck at U-turns, parking (it doesn't matter how or where...i suck) and driving smoothly while going around a curve (i.e. freeway ramps).  Time to practice.  My life WILL become more interesting.  I'm promising myself and to you....I need to have something similar to the freedom of my college apartment days.  I need to get my own car finally...and of course, I need to eventually get my own place.   Wish me luck on my final!

      I'm procrastinating again.    I'm having difficulty really getting into this paper of mine.  At least I have several pages typed and worked out.  I'll just need to edit by the time I'm really done with it.  I want most of it done tonight, so that by the time I'm going to bed, I only need to worry about working out a counter-argument and conclusion and eventually editing.  I've updated my  urlLink "about me"  page...i've put in another song...and only put things that I like or like to do...if y'all are interested, go for it.  as for going in depth about my spiritual "health"...today's not the day.  i did spend some time in prayer for myself and my family...  other than that...i hope all of you had a wonderful labor day.  here in the us, we're setting aside one day to give those who work a chance to recognize all that they do.  don't u find it ironic that despite all that...there's still people workin'?

      Hello all!  I am relaxed...happy...and feeling free!    It is FRIDAY! WOOHOO!  I love the thought of being able to spend my weekends right now resting from a busy week of full-time employment.  No more stress from having to read endless chapters of textbooks on political theories that are debated and discussed...yet not actually in existence !!!  I seriously should have considered literature as a major...  Why?  Well, in ALL of my literature classes that I took for my minor...I did the best out of ALL of my classes overall.    Ironic, eh?  I love reading books...especially if I'm stuck on finding out what happens to the main characters so much that I find it hard to put the book down...and also when I get so immersed in the books that I find myself feeling like I'm part of what's going on with the book... I tend to forget what's around me... (not always the best thing when you're at work...)   Yet... all that is NOT the purpose of this blog entry.  It has FINALLY rained and cooled down in California!  Yay!  I've been so concerned about how the fires have damaged so many homes in southern California.  I find myself looking online to see if anyone I know has been effected... especially since many people in San Diego (where I attended college) have been effected...  Also...  the fresh, cool, and crisp air that remains will help dull the blow of the fires.  What's been considered a "trigger" is the dry, hot atmosphere as well as the land itself.  The fresh, cool, and crisp air also leaves a feeling of cleanliness and refreshment.  It's as if God has cleaned out the smog-filled air and made it great to breathe again!  It's going to feel great to actually NEED a sweatshirt because I'm needing the warm softness of it's hood and front pocket...  and to wear comfy jeans and my wonderful sneakers....!    i love the weekends!  and finally...i LOVE the fact that i FINALLY get to see my paternal grandmother after a month!  yay!  woo hoo!

      I have decided to use my time wisely here at work when there is not as much for me to do.  Instead of wasting it, sitting here with someone stuck "listening" to me complain about how boring it is, I have decided to use this free time to organize my checkbook, and to add a couple of blog entries.  eh, why not?  wouldn't u?  (wink)   anyhoo, what is most on my mind, is the conversation I had with my father last night.  I believe it is how he phrased it...the words he used may not have fully expressed what he was REALLY trying to say, and I misunderstood him at first.  he says that the fact that him and i have depended on one another has been more of a burden than anything else.  he feels that we have depended on each other more than necessary, and that as a result, we are "too close" to each other.    he feels that he needs to bring in a little space in order for him and i to feel better overall. otherwise we will drive each other nuts, and "hurt each other too much".  at first i let him know that i was angry, upset, and hurt.  I thought that he didn't want to be around me as much, and that he was saying that I have only been a burden, etc.  what he was REALLY trying to say was that i need space in order to learn how to be more independent and more "mature" as a young adult.  he needs to give me space in order to adjust and learn how to deal with it all.  we both have so far, contributed to a trend in disagreements and yelling.   i'm mentioning this incident with my father because i have realized that if I, MYSELF had NOT taken things so personally (AS USUAL),  that i would been able to really see and hear what he was trying to say, instead of taking his words, and acting as if he had thrown verbal "daggers" at me.  sigh.    i've been thinking about my life overall.  i would be a much more happier person, and a great person to be around, if i just RELAX, and i know deep down, that i have a decent sense of humor...i truly do like to laugh and joke around...  and that all this other drama, may have been mostly due to my own point of view and thinking.  so, the prior entries about how i need to be a more happier and simpler person.... the whole issue has finally really hit me.  BIG TIME... esp. since the conversation with my father.  the song below finally helped me to realize how i truly need to see myself.  as God's child...why wast time on what could be wrong/fixed?  it's a special blend/mix that God has created...that makes me who i am!  i may have spent time analyzing THIS issue...but it is so that i can finally knock some sense into my head.  lol !!!    may God be with me, as i try to be a happier, content, and simpler person.  may He take over my mind, my heart, my mouth, and my soul.  May He be the One who is always glorified.  Amen.

      The entry will be titled, "random" because the thoughts in my head can be described as such.  First, I know that it's most likely repetitive that i let u know how boring my job is right now...because there's absolutely nothing to do for the majority of the day.  i've bought a new book to read...i've actually brought a chair and sat next to the receptionist so that i can chat with her...and i even also brought my cd player just in case.  i don't want to go nuts, u know.   Also, the new book i've bought is a book i've been wanting to read for quite some time.  i spotted it inside a barnes & nobles way back when it first came out in hardback, and now that it is much cheaper with its paperback edition, i have decided to buy it when i saw it last night at target.  it's titled, "The Nanny Diaries", and it's by Emma Mclaughlin & Nicola Kraus.  Basically, it's about how a young female college student attending NYU tries to earn money by becoming a nanny for the super-rich in the affluent areas of New York City.    I had read parts of it that first time i spotted it in the store, and I've wanted to read it ever since.  I'll let u know what it's like later.    other than that, i've just been chillin'...  time to simplify life after 16 years of fast paced education, part-time employment, and a huge load of extra-curricular activities.     now, i just have ONE full time job...   wow.  so simple.

      i'm feeling much better than i did in my previous entry...  i've asked my father as well as two close friends to pray for me and that has helped considerably.   the following are things i have to get off my chest.  my job = B-O-R-I-N-G!   -it's a great job in a small law firm...but i guess fall and winter = slow season   no more sensitive, crying, drama queen, emotional, angry JULIE. -even I'M getting sick and tired of how I'VE been.   finally, I will strive to be a more happier, active, friendly, and independent JULIE.  As i was at work today, i realized this could have all have been something i could have done on my OWN.  even if it means reading a great book or listening to cool music if i'm bored...and all i need is GOD ANYWAYS.  SIMPLE...PLAIN & SIMPLE.  for those of you that either can't accept that i will change, or have been mistreating me (i.e. being fake/not bothering to at least call ONCE/ pissing me off)...you can just kiss my butt.     i'm just sick & tired of being seen as the sensitive, over-emotional, over-dramatic, & depressed JULIE now.  it's about time that i started something new.  and the only one who i'm depending on is G-O-D.

      Hello all.  It's been almost a week since I've posted anything...exactly six days.  Before anyone reads further...a warning.  I've been told that I tend to ramble, as a way of being of honest to y'all and myself...I can definitely see that happening when I am serious/emotional/upset.  Apologies to all if this entry is clearly evident of this habit.  Thanks.  Other than going to work during the week... during this weekend, I haven't done much.    On Saturday, I woke up later @ 10 am, and then I took a cool shower.  (Everyone can agree...it was totally hot this weekend here in Los Angeles, California!)  Then, I watched Ally McBeal, old "Family Matters" and "Roseanne" reruns, and did my laundry.  Whoop-de-do.  Finally, I watched Halle Berry be the guest host for Saturday Night Live, and had this super long talk w/my bro about how he needs to straighten his life out. (at least in my p.o.v.  what else would older sis's do?)  Today, I helped out, by going grocery shopping with my mother, and then I went to go jogging with her at the beach after dinner.  Yes, I agree.  My life is much more simple and much less stressful than it was when I had been attending school.  Having been able to graduate from undergrad college has helped.  What also tops it all off, is that my place of employment does not require for me to be consistently busy and stressed either.  It has been very quiet for the past couple of weeks or so.   However, the words NERVOUS & SCARED, come to my mind, when I think about how I've felt all day today.  I'm nervous right now because I do not know what is in store for me in the next several years.  I'm scared, because I do not want to fail or make mistakes.  I'm also feeling disturbed, because I feel so far away from God.  Usually, He is not something I try to "shove under the carpet".  Only several people at work and other places I recently frequent, know that I am a Christian, barely.  This used to be THE most important part of my life...   All I know is that as today was ending, and as I was on my way home from the beach with my mother, it finally hit me.  I felt so scared, nervous, disturbed, and even unconfident because I was so-o far away from God.   He is the only One who stops me from feeling alone.  I've been trying to NOT be all those things WITHOUT Him.  No wonder.  I'm a little tired and it's not working as well.  (DUH.)   I know I need to do more than only prayer.  But, for the time being, that is the only thing that I am emotionally prepared to do comfortably.  Going back to a church will take a little bit more for me, as well as opening up a Bible.  All this is what is upon my heart and mind at the present moment.   Hopefully, I will be able to gain at least a little bit of peace of mind tonight.    For those of you who wouldn't mind, please send a few words of prayer up for me.  When things have been settled, and I am at peace with Him...  I will be happy to do the same for all of you...my brothers and sisters in the Lord.    I wish you all a restful Sunday night.

      I feel kinda bad.  There's been people who've left comments and asked me questions, or told me how much they liked my site.  And....  I haven't responded.   I've had several people who've left comments saying that I'm not being "right" on how my approach is with this site religiously and spiritually....  my response to that is, you've been erased, blocked, and please don't bother leaving comments like that.  This is not a Christian website that gives advice and counsel.  It is a PERSONAL BLOG.  It is about MY LIFE, MY THOUGHTS, & MY HEART.   How in the world could I have a right or wrong way of portraying my heart?  Also, thank you to all of you who admire this site and appreciate the song.  I really like that song alot, and not alot of songs can touch me like "I Can Only Imagine" has.  It really puts things into a different kind of perspective.     If any of you have questions or want me to respond right away, perhaps you should let me know.  If it's urgent or super important that is.  Otherwise, the nerd that I am, I will just enjoy your comments and hope that I can see your blogs too!

      Recent entries of mine on this site, have been  "short and sweet" .  I guess it's mostly due to the fact that I only have so much time, due to my job (that has suddenly become busy after being so slow), and because I like to relax/spend time with family/shop when I'm not working.  (smile)  other than that, been trying to work hard at work (i all of a sudden have things to do now!  what a shocker!)  for a while, i was sitting there playing  urlLink snood   and trying to get high scores.  and for the FOURTH time, I also enjoy the beach!!!   hee hee!   however, i was surprised (not shocked however) to hear that AH-NULD won.   You think it'll become a trend for entertainers to become politicians?   Ronald Reagan...u started a fad!  (ex. Will Smith =rumors about president/ Kelsey Grammer = rumors about Senate....plus, Jesse Ventura, and everyone else who ran for Calif. gov!)    anyhoo, time to make the best of the short time AH-NULD has, and as a result, we need to keep it "sweet".

      Well, life goes on.  Last week was a bit of a stress causer, as I was impatiently waiting for my summer school grade to finally come through.    Guess what?  Yay!  I got a B....  after 2-3 weeks of assuming I had done very badly, and hoping to scrape by with just a C...  I found out that I did better than expected.  (yay!)  This means, that after all the paperwork is finalized, Julie Row will officially be receiving her college diploma within a month or so.  (grin)   Moving on, I have discovered that I miss living close by the beach.  I truly miss it, and if I were to ever become affluent, I will secure my ideal residence by the beach, and it will make me happy.  I plan on visiting it, every weekend, with or without companions.  It's so-o peaceful !   Other than that, I am going to relax and calm down after a busy summer.  (sigh)

      Watching: OLD re-runs of Beverly Hills 90210      It's the first day in a while, when I didn't have anything to do for work, family, etc.  I'm finally able to sit and just relax.   I can tell I need it, cuz last night at about 10 pm...  I'm trying to watch some American sitcoms on some of the big networks... and then I fall asleep without any effort cuz I'm tired.  I've been working a FULL and BUSY week.  This week was a tougher one.  I made a mistake with a phone call, and I hade a misunderstanding with a co-worker.  I made the phone call, because I started to become too confident about my abilites to handle a case...  and I misunderstood a co-worker's personality because I lost my confidence due to the phone call.  Time to calm my mind down...and just  treat everything as I see it...and not as I would LIKE to see it.  On Thursday, when it was Thanksgiving, it was kinda cool, cuz cousins I haven't seen in more than 6 months came by.  I was so surprised by my guy cousin, David.  He has gotten to be close to 6 feet...he's even taller than my bro!  I've always thought my bro was the tallest since he's 5 feet 8 inches or so...but that's gone now.  It's David now! It's kinda funny too...cuz he's just turned 16 as it is.  We all pigged out on a Korean style Thanksgiving midday meal (instead of dinner), which included kimchi, Korean side-dishes and a Korean stew.  lol !!!  No worries...there was turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and salad.  hee hee.  After that, all us young ones (me, my bro, and our cousins) went to go see a movie.  the dudes went to go see the latest matix film...and my girl cuz and i went to go see "love actually".  very funny and cute... with hugh grant, colin firth, emma thompson... all the well-known and talented british actors.  I would totally recommend it to those who like the more emotional, intellectual and inspiring films...vs. the films that excite, scare, and make one's heart pound.  hope y'all had a great thanksgiving! (grin)

      just a quick note.  a few of you, who've known me as a fellow sister in Christ are probably curious to how that part of my life is doing.  i've stopped going consistently to church, and i've placed God on the back burner.  i know deep down inside that what i'm doing is not right, and it may explain my recent entries about my arguments with family or my unhappiness with work.  and, i tend NOT to mention Him very often.  although in the beginning it was due to the lack of available transporation...  now, church has become a place i am afraid to go to, because of my experiences of emotional hurt that i experienced down in san diego at a particular church i will not name specifically.  i'm afraid of devoting my heart again...and having it get hurt again.  i know it's just a matter of self-confidence that i have found and received in Him that will most likely help me conquer my doubts and fears...  but i also know that the one church i had faithfully attended here in Los Angeles, during high school, and now wish to go to again, may have changed dramatically....helping me fear it again.  please pray for me...esp. to my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ that I have shared prayers with and prayed for.  as i reflect on how my life has been ever since i finished UCSD this last June...  i've needed God alot more than i realized....i think i'm barely seeing it starting now.

      First, I went onto a high school bud's   urlLink  blog  and found some interesting online quizzes...  I used to search for online quizzes when I procrastinated studying.  lol !  Also, not much else has happened outside of my new job and family.  It's actually interesting to see that once you begin to work full-time, that your life tends to revolve around that one job and whoever you see the most often.   I guess I'm used to having several different groups/locations/activities to devote my time and heart to.  for ex. church/school/close friends/roommates/part time job.  well, i have some bad AND good news.  the bad news first.  the other new female employee was let go this past friday. i'm guessing that differences of personalities, standards, and expectations contributed.  especially with superiors who are very closely linked with korean-style standards and expectations.  it's not my place to judge what's right and wrong.  it's just something i can witness and realize.   well... (wince)  the good news is that i was given a raise and was told that i've been doing a good job.  a part of me is feeling bad because the other new girl and i were actually starting to become acquaintances and maybe even friends....  another part of me is clearly happy because i'm being shown appreciation.   other than that, i was invited to one of the business manager's wedding on saturday.  i felt like i was too new of an employee to attend comfortably, but since i had to go to work on saturday anyways... it was easier to attend with people from the office, and it was clearly an event that was happy and very important to the manager.  i don't regret attending.  i was even given a ride home by one of the other employees, who is a very nice, married, and Christian grad of law school.  my subject(s) of conversation with that co-worker eventually become a starting point for a disagreement with my father however.  my father feels that since i shared about my (very minor) epilepsy, that i've made myself vulnerable to that co-worker...my father is implying that i trust way too easily and that i let out personal aspects of my life way too quickly.    i can understand all of this...it's just that my father tends to show a large amount of anger and frustration while speaking to me about his concern.  which ALMOST caused a fight.  sigh.  i need to be more CAREFUL around even my parents, and now my brother.  something that i'm obviously not used to doing.  all three of them have had to deal with lives that are highly impacted due to stress and financial issues...   sharing openly about work is not something i can take lightly....and expect any of them to be all ears about whenever i want.  i can't always expect the RIGHT kind of response from them either.    with my brother...i just need to NOT make things worse by insisting on shoving my p.o.v. in his face cuz he'll shove his right back.  no luck in trying to convince.  i've grown accustomed to having people leave me alone (i.e. roommates)...or having friends who at least attempt to see why i feel and think the way i do.  they may not agree...but they'll at least try and understand.  i'm not used to having people around me who aren't afraid to disagree and to do it wholeheartedly.  something i've realized today as it being the one and first day off for me  this whole week before thanksgiving.  i must prepare myself for that day as a matter of fact.  it looks like my very small extended family who live in the general Los Angeles area are ALL visiting my home.  from both sides of the family.  time to prepare korean BBQ!  lol!  i'll let y'all know how it goes.

      Well, well, well.  Maybe it's the rain.  Or...maybe it's cuz things are uncertain, shaky, and new....It could always be because...Julie's being her typical paranoid self.  But, despite the fact that overall today wasn't such an evil day...The evening majorly sucked.  It was raining pretty heavily and I had been keeping my feelings about how I was getting along with everyone at my new job within.  I was mainly concerned about my opinion that the main dude...Mr. Hudson seemed to be more receptive and friendly to everyone else except for me...especially the other new girl.  I decided in the end...after alot of frustration and mental analysis... that since the new girl still needs help to feel more welcome and comfortable in the office than I do...that he's just being nice.  I have been able to learn the "ropes" very quickly and everyone ELSE seems to be pretty tolerant of me...even the more introverted and less talkative ones.  so...less need for me to be "welcomed".   so, i was feeling frustrated and i was tired from a long day of work..   and, i came home.  ugh.   my brother and mother hadn't bothered to do the dishes and i was getting very sick and tired of doing them...especially when i have a 40 hour work and he barely just got a new job.  he's basically home during the day.  and...i was annoyed that my brother rented a video...which requires him to watch it on the television that i usually use.  today, all i wanted to was watch "The OC"....one hour of television.    I'm home only at night to rest and sleep...and then I'm off to work again.  and, for him to sacrifice one hour seemed too much for me to be asking of him in his opinion.  argh !!!   so, i had a fight with him.  and finally, i decided to avoid any conversations and interactions with him until it was ABSOLUTELY  necessary for me to talk to him.  it's useless to try and explain my point of view and be logical.  he either takes all...and gives nothing....   and...i end up with squat.  what a lovely place to come to when i've had a full day of work.  i'm very tempted to move out.  and he's the only one who really gets on my nerves.  i can handle my parents.  sigh.  when will i ever be able to go in to a physical ROOM and be able to be by myself for at least a couple of hours every evening?  how bout never...until i get my own room at least?    cuz if i get my own room...i can buy my own TV and watch whatever for as long as i want.   the joys of life....

      Today was quite interesting.  Despite the fact that it was Veteran's Day here within the United States...meaning a day was set aside to recognize all those who died/fought/sacrificed throughout all the wars the US has been involved in, so that all of us now may continue to live in peace....  I don't think I'm going to end up helping one of the attorneys specifically after all.  He was the one who had interviewed me in addition to the other people who had also...  But, I haven't had any direct contact with him...  just the usual "good morning" and "excuse me" (note: the office is a bit crowded)  perhaps, later on when i appear to be REALLY getting the hang of things.  It was still very busy at my new job.  I don't think I even had ONE minute where I was sitting at my desk, waiting...for stuff to do.  As a matter of fact, at my new job...I don't think I EVER wait.  I'm consistently working...whether it's because of all the files that are assigned to me that have documents and letters to be sent out...or whether it's because the office manager drops by and randomly "drops" stuff for me to do... i am consistently BUSY.  by the time i got into the car after the day ended...i started to yawn.  however...i like things to be busy.  i'm being paid to work...might as well be actually WORKING.  makes sense.  i really disliked having to go to work and end up sitting there waiting for work to show up...as a result, i would end up cruising the 'net...or read a book...or listen to CDs.  and...as i may have mentioned before... i have already learned SO MUCH at my new job.    i do admit that due to my lack in skill in speaking and understanding korean...i also lack fluency in knowing proper korean-style etiquette...such as how to address my co-workers when i directly address them, or when i mention them in reference when speaking to clients....   sigh.  if i'm learning how to type letters to insurance agencies...and using all the different machinery within the office...i will EVENTUALLY learn how to speak/act/understand in the proper KOREAN way.  what a busy atmosphere for a day that is what i call a "semi-holiday".  why?    because all the government agencies are closed...but everyone else is open.  oh, the irony.     time to go chillax.

      well... today was my first MONDAY at my new job.  since it was my third day already, i was starting to get the hang of things.  (hopefully)   at least it appeared that way, since the head secretary started to give me more complicated tasks...and because the office manager threw a finished case's file on my desk and said, "Close the file" (which basically requires me to change the case's status on the client database, to add a label, and to file it...)  He didn't have to expect someone to explain it all to me for once...and he seemed to trust that I knew anyways.  Also, the head secretary started to smile and chuckle in regards to me...I think she was starting to feel more comfortable around me...DESPITE the fact that I continued to make mistakes (aargh).  AND... the other young secretary started to actually "talk" to me... instead of talking to me when she HAD to...like when she had to explain something.  she asked me about how I liked the job so far...and whether I had done similar work at my past job(s).  PLUS........  the other new girl started today.  She wasn't what I expected... long dyed hair (the color blond I might add), as well as color contacts that turned her eyes bright blue.  Might I add that she's 100% Korean?  Maybe she likes to try new things...  I don't blame her.   All us Koreans...we tend to look alike.  No variety, you know.  But, she was friendly and easy to get along with too...so no worries.  and, she told me that when they (as in our superiors) interviewed her...that they also let her know that she (and eventually i) would be replacing two of the girls that had been working there because they were unreliable and weren't doing a good job.  i guess by the time my interview rolled around...the two girls had already been let go.    anyhoo, so far I think we're all trying to get used to each other and the fact that the environment has changed as a result.  Hopefully, things will work out.  Cuz not only is it the lawyers, and all the secretaries...as well as a law student and also a "soon to be" bar exam pass-er....  there's also two people who organize all the logistics (business-wise) of the office such as bringing in more clientele and handling finances.  that explains the broad range in personalites.  so far my life has been composed of work...then going home and resting...and spending time with family...and OCCASIONALLY spending time with high school/college friends.  definitley simplified...when compared to the good ole' UCSD days.  other that all that...  not much else has been on my mind besides the thoughts of wanting to go see several holiday season films...  "love actually" is definitely one of 'em.  who would pass up hugh grant, colin firth, and emma thompson all in one film?  i wouldn't. (wink)

      YAY! guess what people?    JULIE GOT A NEW JOB!!!  it was the first interview period.  on thursday, i went to their office at:  3700 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 210 Los Angeles, CA. 90010  hee hee...  and i went there for the first interview @ 11am..  i met with the head legal secretary and i fumbled with my korean...and i thought i had lost any chances...but then...  i was called in for another interview @ 2:30 pm...and i met the head office manager...  he seemed to be okay with me too...because at the end of all the questioning (despite my lack in skill of korean)...he said, "i guess you're hired..."  i guess what did it was when i finally was able to express myself in english with the attorney i would be exclusively assisting, mr. michael kwon.  i sounded much more intelligent.  and i'm guessing my resume as well as first impressions helped too.    i have a 3 month probationary period...to prove to them that i can do it! (smile)  this one's MUCH better... if i end up staying at this one long enuf...i get benefits...possible raises...and even my own business card !!!  it's much more busier...i'm not the ONLY one doing ALL the work...   and everyone there has been helpful and nice in their own ways.  such a broad range of personalities...  it ranges from calm and hardworking...to sweet and super helpful...to super sarcastic in order to lighten the mood...to those who like to get straight to the point and doesn't like anyone who's weak and stupid.  the attorneys...the ones in charge are MUCH more friendlier and approachable.  even the head dude...william c. hudson.  very easy to talk to...despite the fact that they have to be businesslike and stay on track.  anyhoo...the job keeps me busy and i'm learning many things.  EVERYTHING has a certain process that i must learn and remember...i already typed out a page of things i felt i should remember... like how to answer the phone, enter info into a database, type labels, make new files and close old ones...  i've got my own little desk and computer...and, i cleaned and organized it today cuz i have to work 2 saturdays a month...oh well...  everyone else has to too.  now all the drawers are clean and organized....the desktop is clean and organized... and i even brought in my little beanie bear that has a t-shirt that says "i love ucsd".  what else is new when it comes to julie row, miss anal neat freak? (wink)  i just hope that the other new girl that's coming in is easy to get along with also.  up until now everyone has been ok to get along with so far...even the attorneys themselves.  it looks like my specialized tasks will be regarding the cases of the attorney named michael kwon.  i'll be typing correspondence and documents regarding all his pre-litigation (legal code for everything that happens before it actually goes to trial)  otherwise, i'll be helping out with the office overall.  i'll let u know how it goes. wish me luck!

      Well, bad news first.  I was let go @ work.  He (my boss) says it is dominantly due to economical difficulty that he decided to let me go.  he didn't give me the usual 2 week notice...he dropped it on me as if it was a bomb... (i.e. no warning)  and instead he had been mistreating me for the past several days.    I did bring the subject up...in regards to my performance.  He says it's been difficult to have someone with less experience...he's used to having a secretary with at least one year of experience.  I had come straight from college.  I did point out also, that he knew all of this when he hired me.  ahem.  my personal theory:  he tried to save $$$ by hiring someone w/less experience...and hoped he could still somehow get by...and he ended up expecting way too much out of someone like me.  oh well...maybe it's better after all, because maybe it wasn't the right job for me after all.  he was not gaining any new clientele, and because there was a huge lack in activity, there was no way for me to learn at the speed he or I would have wanted.    he was reserved...anti-social...and wasn't open & honest when i felt he should have been.  first, for him to be an effective EMPLOYER...he needs to address issues the right way....  and second, for him to be an effective ATTORNEY, he needs to be more approachable and friendly.    explanation for lack of new clientele.  explanation for why he may have assumed too much and expected me to "read" his mind.  at least set some guidelines!!!  the man doesn't even say hi or bye...let alone set boundaries.  now...the good news...  i'm DEFINITELY moving on.  i'm going to fax in my resume to the company that owns the builiding i had been working in...  they're always in need of personnel...and i may get hired within a position that may pay better and that may give me benefits...    I HAVE A VERY GOOD CHANCE AT GETTING HIRED!!!   yay...  the fact that i have a B.A. in political science helps.  i dunno if gwen will see this...but i owe her a BIG thank you...she put in a good word for me with the company...  she knows i try and work hard.  she and wendy have been the only two people who i've been able to befriend and trust.  i wished him good luck...i wish myself good luck... and i'm moving on to new, better, and bigger things.    even my dad knows the company i'm going to apply to, and he says that it's a strong company that owns many buildings in central Los Angeles.    so, my response?  Lord, If this company has a job for me that You feel is right for me...please guide me and help me to do well on the resume and interview.  May You be the source of my strength and persistence, throughout my efforts at gaining as well as keeping new employment.  May You be the main reason why I make such efforts...and May I strive to glorify Your name.

      I hope all of you have a wonderful time with family, friends, and loved ones.  May this Christmas remind us all of what God has blessed us with already... something I need to do consistently.  Now it's time to chill with the folks!  Ta ta!

      It feels quite odd to be so-o busy at work during this time of the year.  Wouldn't a law office be typically less busy, because the rest of the world is trying to step back and celebrate the Christmas season?    Below is a picture of the building that I am currently employed at.       This is where all that I have described and even complained about has happened.  However, life has not stopped to pause.  Not even one bit.  Here at this office things actually do seem rushed and busy...but not because of Christmas shopping.  It's because insurance companies need to be contacted, letters need to be written, and clients need to taken care of.  phew.  (our office is right in the middle of the first story of windows that you can see...the building is called "Wilshire Park Place")

      hello all.  it's been several days since the last post.  been busy trying to deal and rest from what i was dealing with.  one thing is for sure though...the christmas rush can be definitely felt.    you know christmas is near when everywhere you go, christmas trees are being sold...christmas carols are played...and corny christmas movies are shown on TV.  today was a decent day.  what kept it from being a bad one was the opportunity i had to go see my paternal grandmother. (something i like to do...see the  urlLink About Me  page).  i had lunch with her and spent time with her...something i haven't done in a month or so.    after that, i've come home and just relaxed from a full week of work.  i watched random things on TV,  and surfed the net, especially by looking at already interesting and potentially interesting blogs.  the other evening, i discovered a very entertaining blog.  it's called  urlLink Korea Life Blog .  it had just been updated, so there was a link to it, on  urlLink Blogger .  anyhoo, the guy who's been updating the blog is a very humorous and entertaining writer.   he's definitely one to read and keep up with.  there should be a side link to his site...i totally recommend it to any of you out there who are curious to know what korea is like...  as for work...  the manager and the head secretary have had trouble hiring a new assistant secretary.  the two girls that have come in, have NOT come back.  obviously, that makes it clear that neither of them are going to be hired.  as for me, i've been trying hard not to go nuts.  i know it's most likely because they're having difficulty finding a new secretary, but the head secretary seems more stressed out, and she seems to like to go into a nearby room and shut the door...  i need to keep on telling myself not to take things personal...and that if my input/output really did suck...that, i'd have already been let go like the other new employee had been a couple of weeks ago.  sigh.  i've been able to chat like i mentioned before with the younger lawyer, who's reassured me about the intimidating manager and about my status.  now, i've also been able to chat with the other female secretary, who's a first year law student at Southwestern.  (definitely a place i have interest in)....  so...i asked her if i could talk to her about law school admissions...and, she told me i could call her later on in the evening.  i called her at about 8:30 - 9 pm on Friday night.  at first, i really did ask her about admissions and Southwestern.  then, because i asked her about how she was doing...and since the subject came up...we started talking about work.  to make things simple and short...  she also was able to reassure me about the manager, my status, and about the other female non-friendly employee (UCLA attendee).  basically, she's been told by the head secretary that i've been doing a good job...which is so typically korean of the head sec NOT to tell me directly...not that i'm angry, but it would be nice to know how she felt about my performance...  and that the law student also is treated similarly by the other girl (UCLA), who is not mean...but just very quiet and keeps to herself.    sigh.  and, she's been friendly and feels more comfortable with me (the law student, that is), because she's insisted that we chat and hang out more now.  (smile)  other that that...i've been resting from all my mental stress...and slowly started to enjoy the start of the christmas spirit.    hope y'all have a great week!

      I have a male cousin from my dad's side who is in Iraq.  North Iraq, to be exact.  I FINALLY, have been able to get his email address.  Talking to him is next to impossible, because his first language is Korean as it is.  And...due to the differences in personalities, interests, and LIVES...  we're not emotionally close.  However, that is not going to stop me from emailing him at least several times, showing my support.  One of the main reasons why he joined the  United States  army is because he wants to learn English.  The Korean army and it's conditions are just not the same for him.   So, after I type a bit here... I will say "hi" to my male cousin army soldier.   Other than that, work has been settling down.  I had a very nice chat with one of the attorneys yesterday, and I've been assured that I should not be worried about my status. He also convinced me that the manager is the way he is out of necessity, and that things shouldn't be taken personally (manager = hard on female employees).  Finally, he says that my personality and work ethics work well with the office and how the ones in charge handle it all.  (yay...a little praise.)  I'm guessing what's helped is that I've made a sincere effort to show that I have been learning and that I am independent enough to work on my own.  I've tended to ask questions much too frequently...oh, up until yesterday.    (half smile...grimace)  Also, they're hiring another new secretary.  A female is coming in tomorrow @ lunch time for an interview.  I'll let ya know how it goes.  other than that, i'm going to drown myself in blankets...and watch old re-runs of Friends, Fraiser, and Will & Grace.  (smile)

      1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not?      - I know I shouldn't like shopping as much as I like it now.  But, to be        honest, I really enjoy doing so...  it makes me feel like I myself, am worth       spending time and effort on.  hee hee.   2. What was the last thing you purchased?      -I went shopping today!!!  I recently got a paycheck and had been needing       new work clothes.  I bought two new shirts and a pair of pants.  yay!   3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?      - It depends on what the item is.  If it's clothing...no matter what company       or store it is... trying things on is a given.  However, books, CDs, and        DVDs are easier bought online...cuz I can get others' opinions and reviews.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?     - I never really got an allowance.  When my parents were better off in the        past, money was given if the reason was good enough.  Never more       than $20.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?     - I regretted purchasing a pair of khaki pants from oldnavy.com.  Hence the       reason why from now on, ALL clothing must be tried on.

      today was a very busy monday at work.  basically, we have to start hand-writing christmas cards to all our clients, i had a huge pile of files to organize and handle, and the phone consistently rang.  this is in addition to the fact that there are other co-workers who must do similar tasks also.   but someone helped me realize that perhaps, always relaying about what i did today, is a boring topic for blogs?    since my life has become dramatically simplified... it's easy to blog about what happened and what i did for the day... very easy.  also...  perhaps that is why i'm not realizing that i should be ENJOYING the simplification of my daily life?    i remember when i was struggling to live on my own and do well in school...and was really hoping for simplification back then.  and now that i have it...i'm worried that a simplified life is a bad sign?  argh.  i have PLENTY of time now to read books...  to BLOG...  and to rest as much as i need to.  oh the irony.    which reminds me...even though it isn't even 10 pm yet...i'm going to drown myself in a blanket in bed...and watch re-runs of comedy sitcoms.  another sign that life has become simplified.

I'll be eating lunch with a friend from college and the church I attended down in San Diego.  but... i just finished the interview at a nice law firm in LA, and it turned out ok.  the lawyers did seem to like me...they even said that they "felt that the interview went well".  crossing my fingers and hoping that God will provide a great job for me... this law firm is nearby alot of cool resturants too as it is...  details will come later.  i didn't get to take the drivers' test yesterday because of a vehicle registration prob...  will do so on friday, feb. 6.  wish me luck... will add later this afternoon!   aargh.

      Here is an awesome picture of MercyMe... the group who has written and shared the song "I Can Only Imagine" with all of us.     Their  urlLink website  is also great too... that's where I got this picture.  Their first CD is the one that has "I Can Only Imagine".  If I do decide to include another song... I'm going to provide "Word of God Speak"... it's on their second album.    Please... these guys are a talented group.  God has clearly blessed them with talent in music and songwriting, because even I can see clearly how much this song has been an inspiration.    So... if you have some spare $$$ and you're wanting to buy a quality CD... please try out the MercyMe Cds.  I have both of their albums... and I'm never ever going to get rid of 'em.      (2nd album - Spoken For w/ "Word of God Speak")    (1st album - Almost There w/ "I Can Only Imagine")

      Well, well, well ....  Tomorrow will be the first time since high school, that I will see a former high school friend.  She had stayed within the Los Angeles area, while I attended a university that was 2 hours away in San Diego.  I haven't seen her ever since, and I still had her home phone number.  I left a message with her brother who had answered.  She called me the next weekend, and we both decided to eat brunch together tomorrow.  For those of you who are willing... and, because I know now, that it is the one way that I can truly gain confidence...  Please pray that I will have an enjoyable time tomorrow morning.    I'm nervous... and I hope that talking with her and catching up will be naturally fun and enjoyable...    One thing's for sure... she indeed was a fellow sister in Christ, and she also was the one who introduced me to Christian music.  She is loosely linked with my strong love for the song, "I Can Only Imagine".  As for the renewal of my commitment and dedication to the Lord... it is already helping me.  Things that had been seemingly more close to being hopeless such as my relationship with my brother... or finding a new job... have turned for the better.    My brother and I have now and recently been able to really "talk" and confide in one another.  He's becoming more mature and open-minded.  Other than that, I have been looking online for a new job.  This time, I will go by other important details.  It won't be just the location and prominence of the law firm or office.  Such aspects like the atmosphere and work ethics will become more significant also.  I am going to pray that He will lead me to right place.  It will eventually help me realize whether it is according to God's will that I pursue a legal profession.  I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend!

      As I repeatedly listen to the song that inspired me to start this website...  tears almost come out.  As I read all the different comments that many individuals have left on this website, I realize I have neglected to respond to most of them.  Many of them were inspired by the song, and were touched through its words, like I had been originally.  I thank you all for your words of joy and kindness.  I'm sorry if I appeared to be "anti-social"... hee hee.    I think today is the first time in an extended amount of time, that I have opened my heart up to God and let Him back in.  I was dealing with daily struggles after college graduation and had slowly placed Him lower and lower among my priorities.  I hope this explains my lack in responses.  Today, I had already felt shaky and tired, through my very minor form of epilepsy.  I had ran out of medication for several days due to finanical reasons, and had a minor seizure last night.  Today, I'm having trouble sleeping and eating.    However, listening to this song and reading all the kind words from those who left comments, helped me to realize that God has  NEVER  left  me.   It's hard to describe in words... but there is an overwhelming sense of peace, joy, and calm within my heart.  As I had been trying to rest due to my health, I also felt and still feel more perceptive and aware of what's around me.    Perhaps, at first I was trying to guard myself and keep myself from having another seizure.  I thought it was because my body was lacking the daily medication...    but I had stopped by the nearby store to buy supplies and then to a nearby resturant to buy lunch... and I noticed things like the cashier being in pain because of her injured ankle, but still coming in for work... or the difference a smile and "have a nice day" made.  I think I was depending on things such as daily medications and a full-time job to bring stability...  and when I lost the two I've mentioned (daily medication and job...!), it helpd me realize more fully how much I need the Lord.   I apologize if this entry is not clear or too complicated.  I felt the need to share what was upon my heart...  and to do it through written words, as the sung words of "I Can Only Imagine" were played.

      The weekend has passed and a new week has begun.  Last week was a time when I was trying to relax and rest...    No matter how stable one must be with their full-time employment position....    I also cannot be  dragging  myself to work.  The co-workers, the manager, the environment, and especially the commute would eventually cause me to be unhappy.  Right after I quit my job at the Korean law firm, I started emailing/faxing my resumes to various other law firms/offices.  I have had three interviews already. Two were with other law firms... and one was with an import/export company.    please wish me luck!  because, i have decided that IF i cannot have success finding a full-time, long term position here in the Los Angeles area within a month or so...  that I will seriously consider traveling out of the country/out of state to pursue other employment.  i've considered navy/army/federal employment... as well as the option of teaching English in Korea...   i want to make a careful decision, and before i settle down with the ideal career and family...  i want to make this time the right time to travel and explore.  other than that, i have been resting as I watched movies, window shopped, and started reading dr. phil books!  hee hee.  and... i will FINALLY try to take the test at the DMV sometime this week.  phew...  much has happened in the year of 2004... and i haven't done the same ole' resolution list either.  how funny!

      Since the day has only been half gone...  i feel that i can say this entry can be short and sweet because I am only writing about what has happened today.  First, I dragged myself out of bed, only to be asked that I type a short and sweet letter for my father who needed to send correspondence to an escrow company (he's a real estate agent).  Then, I cleaned myself up a bit...skipped breakfast...and rode the bus to go to the only mall in town...Stonewood.  There I cruised the stores...whether they sold clothing, music, or underwear (Victoria's Secret = semi-annual sale).  I only bought one thing besides my lunch.  It was a very small calendar that was half off...and had only originally been $5.  yay for me.  Then, I cruised on over to my high school...that happens to be across the street from the mall...and had a short and sweet visit with my counselor.  she was happy to see me...as i with her...and, she was so surprised to hear that "already" i had graduated from college.  Then, the library is across the street, so I cruised on over...and am now using their computers to write a short blog entry.  short and sweet.  now time to go home and see if oprah's on.  hee hee.

      It's quite interesting how I need to really be able to say that I'm free and have time on my hands...in order to update this blog now.  why do I say this?  Well, guess what y'all?  I quit my full-time job yesterday.  Altogether...I felt that I gave it some time and eventually enough of a good reason to quit.  I was concerned for my health, because I can have problems in connection with stress.  I was truly unhappy there also.  It's one thing to train and learn well.  It's another issue if you find that you drag yourself to work everyday.  whether or not i could have stayed at my job and been more tougher and less sensitive...  i need to work on myself before i can help myself handle things at work.  therefore, i am taking a small and short break.  today, i went to go see the new Lord of the Rings movie...  and before i did that, i had a nice, relaxing breakfast.  i even played around with the option of joining the military.  i went to go see a recruiter today.  guess what though?  those who have either already done so or are currently doing so....taking medications that is...  are automatically disqualified.    and...i take a mild amount of prescripted medication due to a very mild form of epilepsy.  that also disqualifies me.    maybe it was God's way of saying that joining the military was not in His plan for my future and me.    stuff to think about.

      Hello all.  I just came back from the DMV to take my 2nd driving exam, only to fail it again.  me and the DMV do not mix.  yet... i find this all funee, because i thought i would've passed by my 1st or 2nd try, and now it looks like i have to do it on my 3rd.  this time, the instructor was much nicer and friendly even too.  but, when i made  right  lane changes, i didn't make the correct kind of physical turns to check my "blind spot".  If I had been better about checking my blind spot... I would've passed... barely.  i was able to make another appointment for March 12, early in the morning. wish me luck!  this will go down in julie's history... that she passed on her 3rd try or beyond!  time to practice!  ( and STOP myself from being so-o nervous...)  other than that, i am planning on having some fun.  my birthday is on March 2nd... so, I've invited different friends/acquaintances for a nice lunch/dinner on Saturday.  just want to do something simple and relaxing.  kinda tired from my new full-time job.  maybe we can watch a movie or somethin', afterwards!  hee hee...  as for the things i've been complaining about/struggling with/crying over...    my brother and i are doing our best to avoid conflict... we're getting sick and tired of it all.  my mother is tired period.... she's got a very busy and tough job herself.  also, my new job has been getting better.  i'm learning about more complicated forms/issues/documents....  i've started to befriend a few of the female co-workers  (one of 'em has invited me to hang out next weekend!), and i'm doing my best to learn things quickly and WELL.  now... if only i can pass the drivers' test so i can go to the mall all by myself and leave whenever i want!   lol!  wish me luck... i hope y'all are doing well...  i'll let ya know how my weekend turns out!

      It's been past a week since I've updated.  Apologies.  Since last week, when I complained about my brother and having fights... as well as reflecting on my new job...  not much else has happened.  nothing huge at least.  i did get to do TWO great things this past weekend though.  I went to an old high school friend's birthday party (the one i've mentioned previously), and meet old high school classmates as well as meet other people for the first time.  very nice to not be so shy anymore... oh the good ole days of high school when saying hi and trying to converse was SUCH an event.  MONDAY was also a national holiday... making that day work-free.  I slept until 11 am...  I ate burger king for lunch... and then i went grocery shopping for the family... and that was fun in its own ironic way...  I  was the one who got to choose what to buy!  hee hee...  since then... i've worked a very busy two days at the office...  and, it's been frustrating for ALL of us... because I must run around like a monkey... even with the basic tasks i've been assigned... and the secretary is realizing that training a new person (i.e. me...) is not something she can do at the right pace at the moment.  too busy... maybe due to tax season?  or is the presidential campaign getting in the way?  (wink)  other than that... i am going to do my BEST to get along with my brother... i need to pray and be very patient... i already have come close to fighting aggressively with him more than once since my last entry... and prayer is NOT something i've attempted.    i am going to go to sleep soon... i must get up  earlier  due to the change in transportation for work.  ugh.  good night.

      Here in Los Angeles, Calif. it is approximately 10:20 pm. on Sunday, February 8, 2004.  Unlike the other jobs I've had since college graduation... the job i will go to tomorrow morning... is the first job I am employed at, where I do not have a substantial amount of fear... or a substantial lack of confidence.   sigh.  the main reason for this entry...  i've made up with both my brother and mother...   my brother saw that I was crying... and finally came over and said that he felt that we should try harder to get along with one another. i agreed... and things ended on a quick and simple note.  my mother heard later that I had cried for a long time... and gave me a very long... very strong... and very gentle lecture on how she felt that I needed to really be more strong and independent.  In her own way... she was saying... "stop depending on us...and please become the strong woman i know is inside..."   and, although that could be taken in a practical sense... i am also going to use it in relation with my emotional stability.  other than that... i watched the modern (1995) version of "Sabrina" today.  a little on the slower side... but, very sweet and romantic.   time to "hit the sack".  good night!

      First, I don't want to alarm anyone.  Why do I say this?  Well, I've spent the last 30 min. to 1 hour crying my eyes out.  Why do that?  Well, after having a fight with more than one member of my immediate family, I have seriously realized that I have depended on others' opinions of me to bring happiness and security.    I have done this ever since I first was mistreated at school and at church during my middle school years.  Back then, almost everyone gets teased and mistreated in varying degrees, but I made my own experience appear to be the ultimate worst.  I didn't know any better until I eventually entered college.  Because when one is in middle school or high school, things tend to be within a little "world" of people you've gone to school with for a long period of time.  Once you enter college, you realize fully how that "bubble" is deceiving and no longer important.  Until my senior year of college, I had done my best to use the Lord as my one and only source of love and comfort to bring emotional security and confidence.  He was THE ultimate resource in my life.  However, when I stopped going to a San Diego Korean church regularly because I wasn't comfortable with the tradtional approach of things because of a new pastor, I very slowly decreased my amount of commitment to a church.  To make a long story short, my commitment level slowly decreased until I ended up never going.  Only recently, have I tried to "shop" around for a new one, as well as consider going to the wonderful church I had attended during high school, now that I am back in Los Angeles where I grew up.  Due to all of this, my dependence on others vs. my dependence on God has taken precedence.  I realized this this morning with a huge BAM!  A fight with my brother and then my mother for having the first fight, helped me feel very sad, depressed, and I began to cry my eyes out.  Then, as I was weeping, AND praying... asking the Lord to bring clarity, comfort, and His love...  He "spoke" to me... and I realized that I had depended on my family way too much for emotional stability.  As I turned on some inspiring music... the following song played... helping me to realize this even more.  I would like to share the lyrics with you...  enjoy.  I'll be back for more after I wash up and do my best to make up with my brother.  A little pride and anger is not worth ruining the close relationship he and I had begun to have after he had "cleaned up" his act.   Geoff Moore And The Distance - Listen To Our Hearts  (written by: Geoff Moore, Steven Curtis Chapman)  From the album "A Friend Like U"   (Verse 1)  How do you explain, how do you describe  A love that goes from the east to west  And runs as deep as it is wide  You know all our hopes  Lord, you know all our fears  And words cannot express the love we feel  But we long for You to hear   (Chorus)  So listen to our hearts  Hear our spirit sing  A song of praise that flows  From those you have redeemed  We will use the words we know  To tell you what an awesome God You are  But words are not enough  To tell you of our love  So listen to our hearts   (Verse 2)  If words could fall like rain  From these lips of mine  And if I had a thousand years  I would still run out of time  So if You'll listen to my heart  Every beat will say  Thank You for the life, Thank You for the truth,  Thank You for the way  (From  urlLink Leo's Lyrics )

      Can't stay on for too long because it's already too late... and I want to get some rest so that I can spend some time this weekend with maybe a nice movie or a relaxing hobby.  at work, everyone has a great sense of humor...something that is usually harder to find with those who are dealing with law... or those who are more linked with asian cultures.  it gets OCCASSIONALLY stressful when there's large piles of files to take care of... and demanding clients to deal with...  all clearly evident when the attorney and secretary found it hard to not show their stress and frustration today for my first viewing.  however..underneath it all... they're all great individuals and i can picture myself working here for an extended amount of time... something i could not do easily at other law offices.  bad news though... i didn't pass my driver's exam... i think the instructor that had accompanied me was in a bad mood from the day already...  i had slowed down to hear her directions before i turned right at an intersection... and she turned that into a big deal... as if i had ran into another car or not stopped at a red light.  oh well.  in the meantime i'm going to practice driving... and, i'll hope for the best for my next exam later on this month.    in the meantime... time to rest!  hope y'all have a great weekend too!

      Apologies to the few who have been coming by this site to see if anything new has been posted.  My new job that started on Monday, February 2, 2004... has been great... but also tiring.  I like the atmosphere, and the fact that everyone has a great sense of humor... something I did NOT find in the previous places of employment I've had since college graduation.  I have not ended up at the law firm I mentioned in my most recent entry.  I am actually at a downtown immigration law firm, where there are several lawyers and a small team of employees.  I've met a great group of people, and I hope to meet some good acquaintances if not make some lasting friends.  There is no need for absolute fluency in Korean, nor a immense demand for complete perfection.... such as those that I've either interviewed at... or the places I've been employed at previously.  I can actually smile when I think about my new job.  BUT...  it has been very busy, and I've barely had enough time to eat dinner, take a shower, and rest for an hour, before I "hit the sack".  Also, my high school friend and I have begun to keep in touch once again.  We have always had much in common, and I realized this again, when I saw her a couple of weeks ago.  We're both busy with full-time jobs and other activities... so I probably won't see her again until her birthday in another couple of weeks.  Other than that, I am taking my driver's test tomorrow morning. please wish me luck, y'all!  I'll need it...   I'm going to rest this weekend, and perhaps watch a good movie or two.  I actually deserve it now.  My new job is a great one... but it is also very fast paced and busy.   phew...   and, i've met a great group of people who range from funny and outgoing...to quiet and gentle... to sarcastic and loud...  to shy and reserved...    and, there is something great  about each person... even my boss, one of the main attorneys, the secretary and the young associate lawyer i work with consistently with the main immigration law practice....  wish me luck with this job and my test tomorrow!  ;)

      Whether it's due to good financing, smart choices, or just pure luck... everyone can agree that Mel Gibson, as the sole person to have financed his $$$ on this film, has and will continue to make even BIGGER $$$.  Or... all of us who know that there is a greater ONE who is being glorified through this film, can also say that its success is due to the central message and its power...   It clearly depicts the pain and suffering our Lord, Jesus Christ endured to bear the burden of the world's sin.  wow...   As any of you can tell, I have just returned from viewing that film today.  I gasped in shock and tears fell several times throughout the film, especially when He was being persecuted by the Roman soldiers and the Jewish high priests.  Boy, do I complain about trivial stuff.    Just earlier today, I was talking about my life with a family member... I had been unhapppy with different people/things. Then, I went to go see this movie, and my jaw dropped.    One Bible verse that was quoted in the film, really made me think deeply.  "Remember the words I spoke to you: 'No servant is greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.' " (John 15:20)  I feel like all my life, I've been treated differently because I MYSELF, have been different, whether it was due to my being overweight, or being different from all the other Korean girls in school and church.  However, what I have felt, seen, and endured as one who was unique and unlike everyone else, will never compare to the persecution that our Lord has received for teaching new truths and for claiming to be the "Messiah".  I mention all this, and I also have been mentioning it in my blog for a long time already, because I struggle with such issues now at my new job.  Instead of being secure and confident enough in who the Lord has made me to be, I always worry and become afraid of what others think.  I try more harder than necessary to befriend others so that they will see me in a positive way, instead of being truly content with what the Lord has already done within me.  I saw the film, and realized that despite the depth of persecution He was enduring, He still claimed to be "the Son of God".  It was definitely a film that awakened something deep inside of me.  I need to be content and secure with the Lord, His will, and what He has done in me and for me.  Not with other PEOPLE'S opinions, especially those who do not believe in Him.  Lord,  If this job is where you would like me to stay to earn money and gain experience for my future, may I also earnestly try to follow You and You only.  May I be content with Your Presence only... may that overflow from within my heart.  Thank you.  This film has humbled me greatly... and has inspired me to continuously try to follow Him only!!!

      Hello all.  What an interesting week.  Although I've had a pretty busy and difficult week, because I have had trouble with my lines of communication with my parents, in addition to my full-time job, etc....  I have also been able to show them that there was only misunderstanding, hurt, and confusion.  I think for the first time in a very long time, my father showed me he loved me without hestiation by giving me a huge hug, and helping me wipe away my tears.   So, to end the week on an exciting and happy note, I was invited to Knott's Berry Farm.  I went with several other peers, helping myself realize the difference an outing to a theme park with young "adults" is vs. going as a teenager with other teens.  We rode all the new and  big  roller coasters... I even rode "Supreme Scream"!  It's the grandiose tower that can be seen from the freeway.  You shoot straight up.... and then you fall straight back down at immense speed...!  It was a ride I would have refused to ride in the past.    Then, we went to Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant.  YUM!  All of us were starving by then, and didn't realize until we received our meals, just how much food we had ordered!  YIKES!    Of course, I couldn't finish it all, but I did take in quite an amount of food... hee hee!  Then, we browsed around in several quiet and extravagant shops, and watched a couple of shows. (nothing too grand)  By then, it was dark, chilly, and the only rides we hadn't gone on were wet, crowded, or boring.  So, I came home and took a nice, long shower.     Today, I've decided to stay home and eat a nice lunch...browse through some magazines... and perhaps rent a video.  I definitely know that I want to go to Magic Mountain soon.  That park has double the roller coasters!  It doesn't matter who I go with, as long as they're similar in age to me... and don't mind screaming along with me on all the rides!!!  I realized that I need to find more reasons to smile and realize that God has created me to be a unique and HAPPY person.  I also need to go to very fun places a LOT more often!!!  have a great week, y'all!

      Something I haven't been able to do lately... BLOG DURING THE WEEK !!!  Lately, I've been blogging about how confused and unhappy I've been because of people at work or other areas of my life.  ugh.  Of all the things to get a "wake-up call" from...   the TV show, AMERICAN IDOL.  Seeing a very talented group of young, confident and unique singers helped put things in perspective for me.  they at least appear to be so happy and sure of themselves, especially the ones who are close to MY age.  (early 20's!)  i think that the reason why i'm not able to have the ideal relationships, the best job atmosphere, substantial amount of happiness...   is because i am so UNSURE of  MYSELF .  when i remember how i act, think, and talk when I'm spending time even just on the PHONE with my dear friends, such as Hana....  i know that this whole other PERSON pops out.  i laugh, i joke, and i smile  because i know that i don't have to be afraid about how i'll appear to others and how they'll see me.   i sound intelligent and normal... because if the REAL me doesn't show up... i have all  these abnormal fears and presumptions.  seeing all the performers show all their talent, personality, and even their smiles... helps me realize that NO ONE at work has seen the  REAL me.  the me that GOD has created.  the one that not many people get to see anymore.  and... even though i can't rock the place with a beautiful voice like the American Idol contestants...  i sure can wow people with my personality couldn't i?  maybe i can stop trying so hard.... stop being so afraid... and just relax and have fun being MYSELF, eh?

      Hello all.  Last weekend I was deep in thought... contemplating how I was personally handling things in my life, especially interpersonal relations.  Something I did again this weekend, when I realized that two potential friends I THOUGHT  i had made at work, turned out to be more disappointing on my part, because I expected too much too quickly.  I miss having people from bible studies, church, nearby apartments, classes, and even dear friends as well as roommates to go and grab a quick bite to eat or a nice warm cup of coffee with.  Now, the ones  I still keep in touch with, are my close friends who all live at least 30 minutes, if not several hours away.  I thought with new things in my life, such as my present job... that I would make friends quickly...  but, many of my fellow co-workers are much older with different kinds of life experiences, if not at least married with one or two children.  Also, the fact that I have just finished college, as well as the fact that I am contemplating paralegal certification and law school, puts me at a different mindset than all my other co-workers.  All I know is that I need to start finding better and more consistent sources of pleasure and happiness... the ultimate being the Lord and a strong church community.  What keeps me from doing this.... is the fact I STILL have not passed my driver's exam.  I am thoroughly frustrated with this dilemna.  I have done well enough in life to get a bachelor's degree... but I can't pass the driver's exam !!!!  I am aware that such factors such as my parent's older car, as well as my health may have contributed to the outcome of my exam(s)...  (i.e. lack of concentration due to lack of energy, etc.)    however, i drive satisfactorily according to my paternal aunt... who has witnessed my everday driving, and yet, i still have difficulty.  (hint: I ALSO freeze when the DMV instructor sits next to me!)  sigh.  I think that now that I am obtaining my paycheck tomorrow... I will perhaps purchase a new CD and book.    I will NOT try to earnestly seek recognition from others.... but will do my best to be dependent on the LORD FIRST!... and, I will try to spend my time wisely (explaining why I desire a new CD/book).  let's see how things go this week...!

      The Lord is speaking to me in so many ways today.  I found this on an acquantance's friend's website!  God said…  If you never felt pain, then how would you know that I’m a Healer.  If you never went through difficulties, how would you know that I’m a Deliverer.  If you never had a trial, how could you call yourself an overcomer.  If you never felt sadness, how would you know that I’m a Comforter.  If you never made a mistake, how would you know that I’m a Forgiver.  If you knew all, how would you know that I will answer your questions.  If you were never in trouble, how would you know that I will come to your rescue.  If you were never broken, then how would you know that I can make you whole.  If you never had a problem, how would you know that I can solve them.  If you never had any suffering, how would you know what Jesus went through.  If you never went through the fire, how would you become pure.  If I have you all things, how would you appreciate them.  If I never corrected you, how would you know that I love you.  If you had all the power, how would you learn to depend on me.  awesome stuff, don't u think?  helps me realize my mistake in not going to the Lord even more!    May we all trust in the Lord first and only.

      Today's the first day this week, that I've finally had some time to sit and relax.  I work a very busy schedule for five days out of the week, and I am quite tired by the time I step onto the steps of my current residence every evening.  I know that alot of people have had to deal with a similar situation.  Not only do  I work full-time, but I have to endure the position of being a new employee.  However, it's even gotten to the point where, I am afraid of anything and everything.    For example: "Why is that person coughing and looking at me like that ?  Why is my boss passing my desk ... to check on me?  How come  I  wasn't invited to go see a movie? "     ...and the list of thoughts and worries goes on and on.  But, I realized something today.  This afternoon, when I started playing some praise music on the computer, this song was the first song to play.  Here's the lyrics.   Surrender   I'm giving you my heart, and all that is within I lay it all down for the sake of you my King I'm giving you my dreams, I'm laying down my rights I'm giving up my pride, for the promise of new life  And I surrender all to you, all to you And I surrender all to you, all to you  I'm singing You this song, I'm waiting at the cross  And all the world holds dear, I count it all as loss  For the sake of knowing You, for the glory of Your name To know the lasting joy, even sharing in Your pain   -2000 Vineyard Songs (UK/Eire) Words and Music by Marc James     sigh.  After some deep thought, everything just appears so clear and peaceful to me now.  Now I fully and COMPLETELY realize why I had previoulsy been so unhappy and fearful.    since I was trying to prove that I was worthy and special according to the world's standards...  no wonder I've been so unconfident, worried, scared, unhappy, nervous, PARANOID, and sad.  and... instead of going to Him in prayer, I was asking others to do that part for me, while I myself, was only confiding in others.    So, here goes... before I forget to do it !!!  Lord,  I have quite seriously let my level of commitment and dedication to You and Your purpose falter and fail.  During the times when I had earnestly done my best to make you the first priority in my life, I was truly peaceful and happy.  I have let outside factors that appeared in my life deceive me and convince me to stay away from You.  As a result, I have let my new job be a source of unhappiness and a place where my true confidence in You has not shown.  I need to show you Lord, that YOU are my one source of peace, joy, confidence, and sincerity.  May I do that starting from this moment.  Nothing must come before You.  May I earnestly do my best to do well at this new job, because I am doing my best to glorfiy Your name.  Thank you for helping me realize this all.  I now realize why I was extremely worried and unhappy at my new job.  Please forgive me, I have sinned.  May I do my best to follow you, Lord.  May I truly be a sincere, obedient, and happy daughter of God.  Amen.    Already, my heart feels so free and I feel so comforted and relaxed.  Going to others was not the best idea from the beginning.  Going to the Lord once... and once only has already surpassed all the times I went to others for advice, counsel, and comfort.    Praise the Lord!    As soon as I get the right mode of transportation, I am finding a wonderful church...!  Please wish me luck on my THIRD driving exam on the 12th!  And may this week be a peaceful one at work and everywhere I go.

      Just real quickly...  I am due to go take an MRI of my brain tomorrow morning @ 7:15 am.   Please pray that everything's ok up there.  Also, I've been trying even harder to read and reflect on the book, The Purpose Driven Life... and it's helped me endure bad days at work and bad moments with my brother.  Ultimately, it will help me grasp my life more firmly with hands that are inspired by God's touch... and it will eventually cause me to be a strong, vibrant, and passionate woman of God.  Oddly enough,  I'm not sad or regretful that I didn't take the test on Saturday.  I'm getting a sense that deep down I wasn't ready to start making abrupt and huge changes to my life just yet.    Also, thanks to ALL of you who have supported / welcomed/ comforted/ or loved me this past week and now for this one.  You have all been lifesavers...literally.  good night.

      I finally had the guts to give this blog's address to a few more people...  I guess it's easier to have people who are physically far away from where I'm at to read this blog vs. people  I can actually see face-to-face occasionally.  However, I have stopped being anti-social with God... (get it?)  So, I can do the same for others... especially if they're fellow sisters and brothers in Christ.  Apologies to all who may have checked on this blog... and found that I have not been updating this blog as often as I had in the past.  Having a full-time job that actually keeps me quite busy has dramatically decreased my amount of spare time.  ALSO.... (ahem!)  for those who may already be aware of my health, I am going to make it brief.   I had a seizure on Thursday morning.  I have a minor form of epilepsy, and my seizures are what are know as "petit mal". (loss of consciousness, etc.)  So, I skipped work for the rest of the week, was seen by a doctor, and also by a psychologist...  and, took an EEG (brian wave) exam...  Besides that, I either spent time home (ALONE), or was with a relative spending quality time with those who love me! :)  Other than that, I am still due for an MRI as well as an appointment with a neurologist.  Hopefully, after all of that, someone can verify that I'll be okay.    In my own personal opinion, I feel that stress from not only work but also from my personal life (i.e. family!) has been gradually becoming more and more unbearable until my body reacted.  It is now Sunday night, and after a very peaceful and relaxing weekend...as well as some quality time spent with our Lord too... I am going to do my best to prepare for another week.  Not much else has happened... and apologies if it is uninteresting that I share that I have had health problems...  but for those of you who can either relate or emphatize... please pray for me.  I will do the same for any of you who feel comfortable asking me too.  good night...

      Hello all again...    I just HAD to watch Extreme Makeover:Home Edition, where they makeover family's homes from blah to wow!  Most of the families they do this for, usually have an amazing story, such as a community service worker, or a young man who was handicapped through a car accident, or tonight, it was a family with a grandfather who's had an economically rough life  (boxer -- homeless -- direct inhabitant of family's home...)  anyways... in addition to my past entry, currently i am realizing that i am being spiritually attacked because Satan realizes that I am making more attempts to draw myself closer to God...especially since my high school friend, Emily has been such a huge help.  i am going to continue to keep praying intensively that I will overcome all obstacles in Him.  other than that, i have decided to continue at my current law firm job until something else shows up (i.e. positive results to the exam I'm taking this Saturday!)  if all works out... maybe I'll be in Asia, Europe or New Zealand by this time next year!  i will be more better about updating this site... my apologies...  until next time...good night!

      Someone actually left a "comment" saying that they "missed" me...  wow...  i didn't know that there were at least several individuals out there who actually  read  this blog.    in my opinion however, i read others' blogs to see how they're doing... i guess i could see how that would work in my favor.  i truly believe Satan is trying his hardest to bring me down.  i just was teary-eyed for a bit, because I truly believed that I had no nearby friends.   could i ever be more wrong?  despite how things here are on earth... my one friend...my one ultimately sincere and loving friend who will never forsake me nor leave me.... is GOD.  He will always love me and treasure me... and knowing that and believing that, should be more than enough for me.  I'm not going to go into details as to how and why i felt that way... several individuals and events led up to it actually... but, it was clearly Satan who was trying to convince me that no one outside of my family loved me nor cared for me.  Satan is seeing that I am drawing myself closer to the Lord and now he is trying his hardest to draw me back away.  ahem.  time to go reflect upon that... i will be back later on tonight to let u know how i'm doing in other parts of my life...

      I wasn't thinking that I would stay home from work today.    But, my father convinced me that one more day of rest would do more good than bad... so, here i am.  To explain: Julie may have pulled her right leg's muscles in a more severe way than the norm....  The doctor who saw me the day before yesterday is guessing that at best, it's only a muscle pull.  However, he scheduled a chest x-ray, lab tests, and another appointment with a neurologist.  So hopefully within a week or two... it will be known for sure what exactly is causing the severe pain in my right leg.  I can look at it this way...  this day off is helping me read others' blogs, call a couple of friends who have flexible schedules (non 9am-5pm), and watch mid-day television.  Ordinarily, I would LOVE to go a nearby mall/shopping center and buy several things I've been needing ("wanting" really!) .... especially since I just received my paycheck.... but it's better according to the doc and my lovely dad, that I stay home.  Also, since it's getting closer to spring, I would also LOVE going to the beach, taking my handy CD player along with me.  Gives me time to get away from the "loud" world that I'm stuck in.  Come to think of it, unlike other people, I don't mind going shopping or to nice places such as the beach by myself, as it is.  Gives me time to think and reflect peacefully.  Some of you may roll your eyes or groan when you see what I'm about to "blog" about...  But, I'm thinking that a clerical/administrative job may not be so great after all.    I've only been at the job I'm currently at for a full two months, and so far, it is the best environment out of all 3 law office jobs I've had.  However, as you can tell by my blog... I still complain about it... especially when it comes to my co-workers.  I have a great opportunity ahead of me.  If I pass an exam that I am to take on the 24th of this month, as well as impress people at the US Dept. of State, I may be hired to become a "Foreign Service Officer".  Basically, for those of you who have gone to places such as an US Embassy or Consulate, I would be part of that whole system.  Whether it's a more political or administrative position that I decide to apply for... think about how exciting and different it could be.  I would be able to travel, meet tons of people, learn about US diplomacy, and be part of the US goverment and its system.  Stuff I've been thinking about while I'm home on my unplanned day off...

      I just finished watching the film,  A Walk to Remember .  The one set of verses that was portrayed clearly was 1 Corinthians 13: 4 - 7.   Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude.  It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;  it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth.  It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.   These verses were used to help explain not just the romantic love between the two main characters, but also the love that existed between them that imitated God's love.  I was thinking back on how I started to see others at work this week.  God was DEFINITELY teaching me how to love them all sincerely.  I could smile at those I had hardly talked to before, and I did not feel resentful, angry, or bitter anymore to those I had already felt that way about.  I looked back at how I felt towards everyone, and I realized that what had changed, was that I was slowly holding onto God's love and NOT letting go.  God is so close to me now... He is the MAIN presence in my heart and life.  His word, His love, and His presence is overwhelming me and completely taking over my feelings of depression and hopelessness.  For those that are around me, I have so much love and affection.  Today, I spent the majority of the day with my brother, and I did not fight with him once.  (shock!)  I bought him lunch, dinner, a movie, and snacks.... and helped him browse around for new clothes  and shoes.  I'm not mentioning this to brag...  I WANTED  to do all this for him.  We spent quality time together, and he has been one of the most TOUGHEST people to spend time with.  I see my parents, and all I want to do is hug them and say "I love you".  wow....  letting God take over has brought so much JOY, PEACE, and LOVE.   Bottom line: I feel like the RIGHT kind of love, the kind of love that is described in the verses above, is flowing out of my heart and being shared with others that I hold dear to my heart.  THANK YOU GOD.

      Today was my first day back at work...  sigh.  My boss finally came to me and asked that we "talk", right before I left to go home.  I had missed 2.5 days of work, and I had no doubt he was concerned.  I finally admitted that I had intentions on quitting.  I just hadn't planned on doing it within 2 weeks... I had wanted another month to find a decent job while still receiving health insurance and a steady paycheck.  However, he has been fair and decent about the number of days I have missed within the past three months.  He did admit to me that he himself did not prefer that I stay for another month...not for personal reasons...but for practical ones.   Most people would feel so down from something similar, but I feel conflicting feelings.    I feel so relieved and as if a huge burden has been lifted because I am no longer FORCED to stay at this job, but....  I am also very nervous about my future.  However, I am doing my best to hold onto God's word and realize it's awesome power.   " 'For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the Lord, 'plans to PROSPER you and not to harm you, plans to give HOPE and a future." Jeremiah 29:11   It's about time that I looked to the Lord and figure out what HIS WILL is for my life.... and not to what will bring stability and success.  MATERIAL stability and success was what I got from this job... not peace, joy, and God's blessings.  He will be with me.  I must cling to His presence and know there's NOTHING else that can compare to that.

      Psalm 121   1  I lift up my eyes to the hills--          from where will my help come?  2  My help comes from the LORD,          who made heaven and earth.    3  He will not let your foot be moved;          he who keeps you will not slumber.  4  He who keeps Israel          will neither slumber nor sleep.    5  The LORD is your keeper;          the LORD is your shade at your right hand.  6  The sun shall not strike you by day,          nor the moon by night.    7  The LORD will keep you from all evil;          he will keep your life.  8  The LORD will keep          your going out and your coming in          from this time on and forevermore.   I must hold onto the above words with all the passion and strength that is within me.  The above psalm is God's word.  The words that come from the One who has and will never leave me.  I have tried very hard to stay calm and strong this past year after college graduation ON MY OWN.  There was alot to deal with in my life, and I consistenly went to myself, to others, and to other influences, but NEVER to the Lord.  Which is why my feelings of depression, sadness, hopelessness, and even  suicide  had begun to overwhelm me, until it hit a peak last weekend, and affected my physical and emotional well-being.  Going to church and spending time with the Lord used to be the one thing I longed for.  It was among my top priorities, if not the first one.  However, my move from being a college student, to a young professional shook my confidence and trust in Him.   I'm tearing up as I type these words... the Lord should have been the FIRST one that I turned to, when life brought what it did to me.    I would only ask others to pray for me, I never did it myself earnestly.   This is the one verse that really speaks to me most: "The LORD will keep you from all evil; he will keep your life."  The Lord did what he could to keep me from doing something that I would regret, and that would hurt those who loved me very much.  He kept my life.  It will now go on so that I can fulfill His purpose.  I have had time to rest and reflect upon what has happened so far.    STARTING FROM THIS MOMENT, HE WILL BE THE ONE THAT I WILL TURN TO FIRST AND ALWAYS.   He needs to be my rock, my foundation, and source for strength, confidence and peace.  Doing this all on my own has been too hard and I have failed miserably.  With the Lord anything is possible, and I need to hold onto the  Holy Spirit, and NEVER let it slip away again!!!  And  His word  has opened my eyes and helped me awaken to a new future.  I have so much hope now.  I have realized that becoming a lawyer is not my true desire, and that I have plenty of time to figure out exactly what makes the Lord and myself happy.  Ideas have come up, such as journalism, writing, and counseling (I would understand others because of my own experiences).  I have even thought of becoming a home decorator...because I enjoy watching home makeover shows so much!  I would love... to travel and explore the world,  to write stories and short pieces,  to read tons of inspiring books,  to collect beautiful music,  to watch thrilling films,  to meet other brothers/sisters in Christ,  to become passionately involved in a dynamic church,  to meet a spiritual young man who would become my future husband, and...to never, ever stop trusting in the Lord!!!!   Thank you God.  I owe a huge thank you to Hana, Emily, Melissa, Nichole, Maki, and to my father.    I will never ever forget what was said and done on my behalf...  I am now ready to finish the week off with peace in my heart....to keep the Lord very close, and to pursue a future through the right career, hobbies, and people that will all help me pursue His will and purpose. THAT will make me consistently happy.

      It's been a fast Saturday.  I woke up late... and got ready quickly to step out the door.  I ended up eating a late breakfast/early lunch with my family, and then went to go see my psychologist.  She was helping me to see that the fact that I'm not sure about what career and what future I wanted for myself, was not a crime in itself.  It is NORMAL for those of my age to explore, to question, and to try various different things before they settle down.  I also need to take a step back and not take things so negatively and dramatically.  I need to enjoy the life God has given me... and I need to also see that He may be trying to teach me and guide me, ESPECIALLY since now's the time for me to figure out which direction to go towards.  After spending some time with her, I spent a big chunk of the day with my father, my uncle (his bro), and my grandmother (their mom).  We helped my grandmother buy a new rice cooker and some dishes.  Then, on the way home, I ate In-and-Out (yum!), and now I want to relax after a very busy week.  Tomorrow, I'm not quite sure what to do to help myself relax and rejuvinate for another week....perhaps, we will do something special since it's Mother's Day, but it's normal for my family not to plan something out ahead of time.  The majority of the week went  by quickly, but on Friday, my boss (one of the partners of the firm), was in a very bad mood.  That made things tough for everyone.  The day ended on a bad note especially, when he forced me to sit and listen to his lecture about how I needed to keep up with things more better.  I found that hard to hear, after I had spent the week trying twice as hard to stay on top of things, and to show them that I was capable of a high and stable performance.  He most likely was too busy to notice my performance this week... and the other secretary tried to point out to me that it was his way of "yelling"... he's much more careful with me than he is with her, in other words.  sigh.  Time to pray and seek His guidance.... and I tend on exploring other job options.  I want to be in a job where I enjoy the work, or at least "KNOW" that it will help guide me to the right path for my future.  Who knows, maybe all I need is to take time out to explore the world.... and to explore what I'm capable of and figure out who I really am....because that will help me know what career to pursue.  Time to watch re-runs of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.  Time to relax.  Have a great weekend, y'all!

      must go to bed soon....have to be up early for work.   ugh.  we cleaned our apartment this weekend, especially the rooms that the whole family uses the most (i.e. living room/kitchen/bathrooms)  while i was helping with that, i put up a random calendar up next to the computer from a nearby Korean church...  and i like the picture for May.  It's a picturesque church on a very small island in the middle of an Austrian lake.  sigh.  sometimes, i get the feeling that i'm not a true city girl at heart.  here i am NOW, living in the middle of Los Angeles, and yet I dream of what it would be like to live in the quiet countryside, the majestic mountains, or near a refreshing beach.  if i ever get the chance nowadays, i always grab the chance to go to the beach to walk around and relax.  after a stressful week at the immigration law firm i am currently working at, going to places like the beach or the mall to "pamper" myself on the weekends, have really helped me feel happier and help me become strong to endure  another  week.  sigh.  i have ALSO begun to see a psychologist... who has slowly helped me to realize how valuable my self-worth and self-confidence should mean to me.  all these different activities and thoughts from this weekend and today have helped me to simply.... feel better.  today, i watched american idol and i personally enjoyed the performances of a couple of girls who sang their hearts out... and i have begun to read a great Nicholas Sparks novel.  oh! and, i've been continuing to read "The Purpose Driven Life".  I have just finished the chapter on fellowship.  good stuff.  great reading, calm music, places to go to relax, shopping for a few select items, watching a happy film, trying to laugh and make the best of things at work, and most importantly...  continue to ask God to overtake my feelings of depression and anger and replace it with His presence and love.  can y'all tell how much it's helped?

          urlLink Official Site of "13 Going on 30"    Above is a random picture to remind me of the wonderful film I watched this afternoon.  Below the picture itself, you will also find a link to its official site.  I enjoyed this film more so now, because it helped me to realize how complicated-ly I was seeing my life.  Instead of enjoying simple things like the main character did with a 13 yr. old mind.... such as candy, cute clothes, etc.  I was wanting so much out of others... and  demanding so much of myself.    As I have mentioned before, I MUST learn to love myself.  Today, as I was at the mall... I pampered myself.  I bought a new pair of shoes, a new purse, and ahem... a new bra.  I also bought a new book to read during my lunch hours... and as I have said, I watched a cute and simple movie this afternoon.  It did not matter ONE BIT.... that I was doing this all by myself.  I kind of enjoyed it that way, because I could either leave a store quickly... or spend as much time as I wanted in a particular store.  Several stores I even visited more than once... I tend to be slow and ideally... more careful with purchases.  It made me feel so much better to not spend time sitting and "thinking" (i.e. worrying) about my life and all its lovely details.  Instead, I gave myself plenty of time to "treat" myself to things I have been wanting... and throughout it all... I was walking with good tennis shoes at a faster pace than normal... and now my waist is "feeling" it. a nice way to "execrise".  (perhaps due to the constant manuvering i did in that so-o crowded mall)  i need to "treat" myself more often... especially since the psychologist i've been seeing has been strongly suggesting it.   and.... (drumroll please)  Julie MUST make strong efforts to be H-A-P-P-Y.  I have been either unhappy, sad, or even depressed for the longest time.    no more pressure to be successful...to be liked by others... to please others... to appear well accomplished....and the list could go on.  i am going to love myself.... and my wonderful Lord.    i also made sure to watch Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.  I love that show... seeing how a large network show helps those who may need home renovation in unique ways... and who may deserve it in unique ways too.  that show helped me realize something i've been wanting to admit about myself for the longest time.  i see myself commiting my life and future possible career doing just that.  ...helping others who deserve and need assistance and blessings.  how...now, that's something i'm still struggling to find out about... especially since going to law school seems less ideal for me.   i am going to continue to pray.... let's also see how well i do this week.... especially at my current job.

      I've just been able to go online quickly before I "hit the sack", after spending alot of time with my family.  I won't know the results to my MRI until I see my nuerologist on May 11.  I still have to somehow let my boss know that I will be arriving late that morning... (yikes!)  I have slowly realized that my dependence on the possibility of others' validation and acknowledgement of myself has helped to cause my feelings of stress and unhappiness...which may have led to my health problems.  This is in addition to my unhappiness with my current situation -- be it my job or my current residence...etc.  I have begun to see a psychologist... and with her help... I have slowly realized that ULTIMATELY I have tried way too hard to please others... when I should have been pleasing GOD first... and myself.  I don't have the time to find the exact place of the verse in the Bible....but to paraphrase... "Love others as you love yourself".  I need to start loving, validating, and appreciating MYSELF.... if I am to love others around me.  otherwise, if i am unhappy with myself... then i will consistently be unhappy with others also.  so, after much thought and prayer, i am thinking of what i can do to bring happiness to my life.  i have decided on two things.    i will try to see if my job as an adminstrative assistant in a law firm (esp. since i've been doing for the past year), is not what is best for me.  perhaps the job itself, vs. the environment, the workload, as well as my performance are not what should be focused on.  maybe, i need to figure out what job is indeed best for my life and my happiness.  secondly, i have decided to break away and see if i can move out on my own.  i am emotionally very attached and dependent on either friends or my father... and that needs to stop.  i must be dependent on the Lord alone... and i must develop my self-confidence so that i can be strong enough to depend on myself also.  perhaps, the above will help me to emotionally be strong, stable, and confident in the Lord's name.  physically, i have been feeling somewhat better, after I asked for prayer and after I prayed myself.    perhaps, the past several weeks of declining health was a sign from the Lord that I was placing myself in a situation that was forced by others' expectations and hopes for me...vs. pleasing the Lord and pleasing myself?  stuff to think about.

       by Todd-Michael St. Pierre   from  urlLink Passions in Poetry    We share secrets,  we laugh and even cry, We have so much in common, Concerns, likes and dislikes.  Ours is a relationship joined by Tender velvet chains that link our similar dreams of life and love.  A gentle intuition guides us in our individual struggles to succeed at the things we pursue, to stand out from the crowd.  In you I have found so much of myself, Including many of the same Insecurities and philosophies.  Complete inner-peace and happiness, These are the things I wish for you, in the present and in the future because you are my kindred spirit.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Another "wow" poem.  But this time, it wasn't just "me and God".  This one portrays feelings of gratitude and respect that I feel for my dear friend, Hana.  If she reads this, she'll probably be embarrassed because she doesn't like attention to be brought to herself (hee hee...)  But she deserves to hear every "thank you" I've said to her.  Unlike most of my former friends (who will remain nameless)... who found it tiring to hear me express my pain and sorrow over my personal life in large part because of my family, she was patient and listened to EVERY word I had cried, said, or mumbled.  She understands what makes me feel better, how to help me feel like I'm cared about... and she understands my mind and heart better than anyone.  And... she's the FIRST person I've trusted enough to call as my BEST FRIEND.  I don't hide anything from her.  So... probably that's the reason why I felt like I wanted to post this entry here.    She herself got a copy of the poem too.  ;P

       by BSC  from  urlLink Passions in Poetry   As the scarlet sunset slowly fades, And dusk introduces the night, The crescent moon on center stage, Gives forth a semblance of light.  Perching on the mossy dock, Staring out at the mirrored lake, I reflect on this new battle, Unsure of which road to take.  In this dark serenity, I humbly look up to You, Asking for Your guidance, To show me what I must do.  Gulls appearing as angels, Are soaring through the skies, A congregation of wispy clouds, Have taken control of my eyes.  Billowing sleeves of purest white, Seem coming through the haze, Majestic, gentle, outstretched arms, At once command my gaze.  Asking for some answers, You've come with Your embrace, Through the just born evening, You've filled me with Your grace.  The water without a ripple, Reflects this scene from above, A most magnificent masterpiece, Painted wholly with Your love.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  When I read this poem.... My mind went "WOW".    It's a quiet evening at my family's home.  I'm the only one home... I have relaxing music playing on my computer... and I'm reflecting on the words above from a poet who can express the beauty of nature, the beauty of dusk, and the beauty of our Lord through WORDS.  It gives me even more inspiration to hold onto my dream of pursuing a writing-related career.   I have to admit, earlier this afternoon, I experienced a "see-saw" of emotions.  For those of you who don't know, I registered with a nearby employment agency and today was the first day they called with a job offer that had really appealed to me.   I would have become a typist/word processor (it's somehow related to writing, right?) for an executive at the city hall of the nearby city of Commerce.  The city is right between my city and downtown LA, making it at least 10-15 minutes if not more, closer to my home.  So, I go to the employment agency @ about 2:30pm, I take a typing test, and I'm told that I can start the position right away @ 9 am TOMORROW...  and I'm ecstatic and I also do not hesitate to show my gratitude to the ladies who worked at the agency.  I had been so anxious and nervous about finances, even though I shouldn't have been that way.  Then, right before 5:30 pm today, I get a phone call again, saying that due to bureaucracy and so forth, that the position had become cancelled.  There goes the "see-saw".   However, I've done my best to say simple prayers to the Lord... and I'm going to do my best to truly believe that this job didn't work because it was not God's plan for me.  and...the agency said that they would keep on trying.     So, to help myself stay calm and relaxed... I go online to see if I can read some Christian-inspired poetry.  I play soft music... I find the above poem... and it helps me see my own vision of the poem's lyrics in my mind...  And I love the thought of looking out over a beautiful lake... while feeling the power and love of God.  And... realizing the emotions that are stirred up... the inspiration it brings to my heart...  beautiful words about the Lord's presence helps clarify my deep desire to use the written word as an integral part of my future.  Which explains why the legal field was not the right career path for me.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lord,  Please watch over my family and I.  I have concerns over my well-being, as well as the same for each family member (immediate & extended).  Please recognize my deep desire to acknowledge You as the ULTIMATE source of comfort and blessing... and I hope to gain employment and stability through You only.  I pray for the same for my family.  Lord, in addition, may you watch over my dear friends & acquaintances... and may they be blessed through You.  Amen.

      I am at the library and not on my own computer...so I have limited time limits to the computer.  I will go to see my paternal grandmother soon, because I love spending time with her... ('member? I take after her alot?)  I will somehow organize the BLOB i just left in the last entry... (meaning too much info in crowded space!)... because that's all info I would like readers to see in a consistent space set aside for just that purpose... (yes, I know... I'm like  Monica , from "Friends"... lol!)  Anyhoo... I spent a good portion of today calling beloved ones (as well as those I haven't spoken to in awhile), to say a quick "hello".  Mostly it was to leave a quick voicemail, wishing them a great weekend and summer... and (for the most part), that I had fond memories and desires to meet/chat with them.  For one or two people...it was just to say hi.  Even  I  know who to give space to because of religious/personality/life differences.  So-o...time to move on.  I AM going to pursue a career in writing-related fields... because THAT is something I can pursue with passion and strength of will.  And once I get ANY opportunity in that field... I know I can stick it through on a long-term basis.  More laters.... trying to gather thoughts in the middle of the day with a time constraint is a little tricky.  bye!

      I have so-o much spare time now.  In a way, it feels weird...for the past year, because I pursued full-time employment, I would come home and only have like... 4 hours max. to relax  before I had to "hit the sack".  Now, I'm able to read through all my magazines, start cruising through a couple of books, and last night, I didn't go to bed until 1:30 am, because I was trying to finish some crossword puzzles!  hee hee!  I just finished "Tuesdays with Morrie" the other night.  That's a good book.  What I like about it is not only it's message (for ex. $ and power mean nothing when you could have love, friends, and a great family)  ...but, I also like the fact that it's simple and concise.  It gets right to the point, so it's easier to understand.  So a deeper and more intellectual message will be easier to grasp.  Now, I'm starting to read a more funnier book called "the devil wore prada".  it's about how a young woman had to deal with a horrible boss in the fashion industry...   i've had my share in the legal business...definitely can see where the author comes from... hee hee.  i've watched both legally blonde and legally blonde 2.  nothing deep about those movies...but i would watch those films in the past, because they make getting in and going to law school seem so-o EASY.  (remember, until recently, I was considering that field as my future career?)  however, today, I am going to write some pals back (thru email)... and maybe look for jobs.  a job that will bring at least some peace....  will add more later perhaps... i'm gonna go Sav-on's and buy some more diet coke.  ;)

      "My soul finds rest in God alone;  my salvation comes from Him.   He alone is my rock and my salvation;  He is my fortress, I will never be shaken.   ...Find rest, O my soul, in God alone;  my hope comes from Him.  He alone is my rock and my salvation;    My salvation and my honor depend on God;  He is my fortress, I will never be shaken.  My salvation and my honor depend on God;  He is my mighty rock, my refuge.    Trust in Him at all times, O people;  pour out your hearts to Him;  for God is our refuge.    ...One thing God has spoken,  two things have I heard:   that you, O God, are strong,  and that you, O Lord, are loving.  Surely you will reward each person  according to what He has done."  (Psalm 62:1,2,5-8,11,12)    I really need to hold onto the above verses with TRUE conviction and faith.  During the evening, I started to become very worried about my finances.  As described in my prior posts, I have just quit my most recent job.  I spent parts of today inquiring about health insurance, bills, and my bank account, and I am clearly worried.  However, I felt that the Lord is leading me onto a new  path and direction , and  that working in a law firm, as well as going to law school was not what He desired for my life.  So, I must have faith and know that HE is the Savior and my refuge and source of strength.  and, now I must walk with determination to a future that is led by Him.  (Maybe I'll add a more casual entry tomorrow after getting some rest)

      Time for a more kick-back and down-to-earth entry to add.   An entry that lets at least ONE person know about some everyday details...  It's good to be deep and emotionally stimulating... but it's also good to be funny.  hopefully, i will have more opps to bring variety to my blog now... since i will have much more spare time starting from this week.  (wink)  For example, on the weekends when I'm NOT working, I tend to either spend time with my immediate family or my extended paternal family....  or...  I'll go to the mall.  hee hee.  Yesterday, my uncle wanted to treat my grandmother to a nicer lunch in Koreatown, because he didn't get to see her when she came back from her quick trip to Korea.  So, yesterday I accompanied my father, my uncle, and of course, my grandmother to a decently organized Korean BBQ place in LA.  Not bad.  I don't eat that much meat as often as I used to. (Julie's actually trying to be careful with her weight!)  I enjoy spending time with my grandmother because I take after her in many ways, and I love her dearly.  There is a feeling deep within, that convinces me that I must do what I can to spend as much time with her before it is too late.  also, i tend to go to the mall even if it's by myself.  today, i went to cerritos mall from the late morning until mid-afternoon.  i looked around in the bookstore, Sam Goody, and several clothing stores before watching "Raising Helen".    not a deep film, but cute and affectionate...  actually, i've been frequenting the movies lately.  i've seen all the latest good ones.  troy, harry potter, shrek 2, etc.  i've even rented a few good ones... like, along came polly. that's a funny one, if i do say so myself.  being by myself in a mall helps me feel relaxed.  i'm naturally introverted, which brings the need for me to be alone in order to "recuperate".  i have made strong efforts to be more confident and friendly to others, especially if they've proven to be willing to spend time with me, and keep in touch.  so..time to relax...time to look around at nice things...and to finally rest from stress.    smile.

      "The Lord your God is with you, He is mighty to save. He will take delight in you, He will quiet you with His love, He will rejoice over you with singing."  -Zephaniah 3:17   I've seen and heard this verse before, whether it was in passing, in church, or even on TV.   It wasn't until tonight though, that I LET it mean something substantial to me.  Ever since I WILLINGLY asked Him to take over and overwhelm my prior feelings of hopelessness and despair, and replace it with such peace and joy...  this verse seems to really "hit the spot".  My parents and I were discussing how our family and even our extended family were doing tonight.  One thing that was clear was that my mother and father were realizing how much it meant to my brother and I that they had stayed together despite what our family had went through together because of financial and emotional difficulties.  We have others that we know and appreciate who have had to struggle through other issues such as divorce.  I was watching my parents when they were together tonight, and my father was helping my mother by helping her with her hair... he was massaging some "hair dye" in where she couldn't reach herself...   and I realized how much it meant to me that they had made such efforts to stay together, even if our family didn't have BMW's, a 2-story home, or tons of money.  so...  i took delight in the Lord's name, that I was feeling better through HIM, and through my own efforts at gaining joy and peace... and seeing love in my family.  yes, my future has become more uncertain now.  I have finally and ultimately decided to NOT pursue a career in law, and to try other fields that would make GOD and me happy (such as writing, non-profit work, counseling, etc...)  and, yet, I am much happier than I have been in SUCH a L-O-N-G time!!!!    my last day of work has officially been set, and it will be this Tuesday, June 15.  I've actually made a couple of friends, if not acquaintances, that I will miss from the office.  I've bought a couple of simple "thank you" cards for a couple of individuals... out of everyone, these two females have been the most patient and supportive...   ...as young, inexperienced me finally realized i was getting burned out as a result of being in the non-ideal field.  He is mighty to save! (cuz earlier in May, I was pretty unhappy with my life...)  He will take delight in me! (cuz I'm worshipping in His influence through His presence...)  He will quiet me with His love! (quiet music, quiet places like home, quiet people like my close bud Hana who might visit, and his love will bring peace to my mind, mouth, and to my actions!)  He will rejoice over me with singing! (time to dive into the world of praise music!)  anyone agree that things are looking up... even though life is making some twists and turns?  ;)

      As I sit here before the computer, finally reveling in the opportunity to relax and reflect with no time limits... (hint: it's been a busy week)  I go to God's word once again, because I yearn to seek counsel and wisdom from the One who is THE ultimate source of such things.  I finally find the following verses:  "But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.  For He himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility..."  (Ephesians 1:13-14)  "Now listen, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.' Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow.  What is your life?  You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.  Instead, you ought to say, 'If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that.' As it is, you boast and brag.  All such boasting is evil.  Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it, sins."  (James 4:13-17)   sigh.  Basically, these verses are confirming and emphasizing how much I need the Lord and have ALWAYS needed Him.  I worry and think about what will happen next in my life, because the last day for my current job has finally been set.  And, until very recently, I was focusing on what  I  wanted.    oops.   I really need to spend time in prayer, asking the Lord for guidance... and most of all, I need to trust in Him with ALL of my heart, mind, soul, body, and passion... from deep within... with all the strength and energy of my life.  Here's some more verses that will help me realize this more clearly:  "So do not worry, saying 'What shall we eat? or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'  For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.  But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well."  (Matthew 6:31-33)   Yes, it's true.  I have already made some efforts at finding a new job... but what needs to change from this moment, is my focus... the reasons WHY should be focused on realizing what God's will is for my life.  One thing has become clear to myself and those around me.  When I worked in jobs and fields that appeared to bring opportunities for success and stability, my health and emotions overwhelmed me.    Because, when I look to the Lord for direction and purpose, I can push forward in any job or field with strength of mind, body, heart, and conviction.  When I didn't look to the Lord, my strength was lacking in many areas and in many situations.   Spending time with my family, reading His word, praying to Him with sincerity, becoming involved in a strong church, and letting the Lord lead me and my future WILL take precedence.   As I come back from the trip last week, where I got to see such wonderful places that were examples of God's work in creating this earth, I feel at peace.  I saw how much I had become caught up in my life and concerns, that things around me such as the sky, beautiful lakes and waterfalls, and the refreshing wind were overlooked consistently.  I've already received a phone call and an opportunity for a phone interview with a non-profit organization here in Los Angeles.    There are already signs that I need to and should trust the Lord.  May the Lord lead me.

      my family and i went on a tour with a korean travel agency to yosemite and lake tahoe this holiday weekend.  the following verses resemble how I felt when I saw all those beautiful places...  "God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way, and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roam and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.  There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day..."  (Psalms 46:1-5)    here are some pictures!     My family and I on the "M.S. Dixie" at Lake Tahoe      My family and I in Yosemite (the waterfalls were great!)      Here I am, having fun @ Yosemite... anyone else wanna join me?      A very peaceful and beautiful river near Lake Tahoe...

      "Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him....  Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love Him...  Every good and perfect gift comes from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows."  James 1:2-5, 12, 17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  I believe that I may have experienced trials in my previous jobs to gain wisdom on how to handle myself during employment... such as not heavily mixing personal matters and how they affect me, with how I present my demeanor at work.  Other issues come up such as being careful about how you act and speak among co-workers because many love to gossip and to change what is true, no matter how personal an issue may be to the person involved.  Another issue is dealing with awkwardness and  conflict.  I titled today's entry as "weakness", because I showed emotional and spiritual weakness yesterday, and then today, to a greater degree.  Yesterday, I was feeling insecure because of my lack of confidence on how others viewed and treated me. Today, it became more open and apparent, when I allowed what was meant to be a harmless joke become something that hurt me personally.  Everyone at my new job does not realize how hard I have tried to pick myself back up to a great degree, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. I do not expect them to know, when I have not known anyone closely, and because I have not expressed anything to help them realize such issues.  To clarify: two months ago, I was so sad that I contemplated "ending it all" because I felt that I was so disappointed with how things had turned out in my life.  It took all of who I am in Jesus Christ's name, to turn around, to cry out to God, and to earnestly seek His intervention and providence.  Knowing that His awesome love was consistent and so powerful, has brought so much joy into my life, causing me to be very talkative, comedic, and cheerful.  However, today, a male co-worker commented on how I was TOO "talkative" and that I "joked around too much", as a way of joking around with how he viewed me and my personality.  Afterwards, I spent time thinking about possible hidden meanings, indirect implications, and assuming basically the "worst".... and, I let myself believe that my joy and cheerfulness was indeed misguided and extreme.  I HAVE A LONG-TERM BAD HABIT OF OVER-ANALYSIS AND EXTREME WORRY.  I really shoud have seen the joke as being  a way of expressing one's sense of humor, and not an expression of spite or sarcasm.  I spent my lunch break, weeping and praying to the Lord... asking that He help me stand strong in His name, and realize my self-worth according to  HIS  standards... I was also crying out to Him, earnestly asking Him to clean my mind, my deeds, my heart, and my life from all that brought fear and sadness... and ultimately bringing out the confident young woman of God I knew was struggling to be revealed.  The Lord brought another Asian lady to me during my lunch break. I explained what was happening as simply as I could, because she was concerned that I was so tearful. She responded by saying, "Asians are usually so stoic. Julie, when I spoke with you last week, you were like such a fresh breath of air to me. You made me feel like I could totally have a better day..."  I thanked her and told her that I was glad and that I needed to hear such words from someone I had only known for a short amount of time.  After giving my one co-worker space, I finally approached him at the end of the day. I honestly expressed what I had been feeling. I felt it was necessary that I be honest, especially when I am usually very friendly and talkative to him.  He was very surprised, and he appeared to not know what to say. The only thing he did say was, "Maybe you and I DO indeed to give one another space, because I feel that I may have to be very careful and guarded around you now. I feel like I may have to walk on 'eggshells'. "  To summarize an email I sent to him afterwards, I stated that I wished to move on, and that we can just see this experience as the two of us adjusting to one another's personalities and life experiences in a way that was unique and perhaps, more abrupt than usual. I wished to remain as friendly co-workers.  To view the situation from a more broader range: This I believe, was a great example of spiritual testing, and to see how quickly I would give in to my emotional weakness. I have recently been earnestly seeking the Lord and becoming more intimate with Him. It would not be surprising for me, if I were to be tested in regards to how long I can stay confident and joyful in the Lord's name.  May the Lord continue to strengthen my heart and mind... as I lay my burdens and my spiritual well-being at His feet.  Please, for those of you who are willing, I would appreciate your prayer, as I strive with all my heart to stay on track and continue to stay close with the Lord.  Thank you.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  (update as of 8/1/04)  I should have not approached my male co-worker so openly and bluntly at the end of the day. The topic of my feelings should only been discussed when he also noticed something was wrong. Such concepts like: timing, both sides noticing discomfort, both sides being ready to be open, etc. should have been seriously considered.  Initially, all the above issues are those that dealt with ME only. It was started by and linked to another person, but the struggle and thought process afterwards, were all on my part.  This helps me realize how I may have caused potential for alienation. However, I am going to lift this up to the Lord in prayer, and ask that He bring His healing and wisdom, so that I may continue to get along with this male co-worker. Anything is possible in the Lord's name.

      "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.  After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountain-side by himself to pray.      When evening came, he was there alone, but the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.  During the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.  When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrifed.  'It's a ghost,' they said, and cried out in fear.      But Jesus immediately said to them: 'Take courage!  It is I.  Don't be afraid.'      'Lord, if it's you,' Peter replied, 'tell me to come to you on the water.'    'Come,' he said.    Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.  But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, 'Lord, save me!'    Immediately, Jesus reached out his hand and caught him.  'You of little faith,' he said, ' why did you doubt?'    And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.  Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, 'Truly you are the Son of God.' "    -Matthew 14: 22-33    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    I, as well as all dear friends and family, must realize the power of God and have consistent trust in the Lord's presence.    We must lay our destination in life in the Lord's hands... and lay our complete trust in Him during our journey to such a destination.    wow... the difference my daily devotional for today, Wednesday, July 28, 2004 can make, especially during a very busy day at my new job.      May the Lord humble me.  Time to sleep.

      According to  urlLink Dictionary.com , the word "sweet" has several different definitions, but the one that seems to fit me best tonight is:   Pleasing to the senses;   pleasing to the mind or feelings.     I've been listening to calmer praise songs as I look at beautiful pictures from my computer of beaches, lakes, mountains, cities, famous landmarks, or the countryside...    and doing that has been pleasing to the senses, to the mind, and to my feelings....or simply put... it has been     sweet   .      One thing is clear as I  hold onto the Lord's presence.  I AM going to do my best at my new job, despite the doubts, fears, and flaws that I WILL be tested with.  I MUST bring glory to God... and prevail, endure, and let His presence be everlastingly SWEET... to me, to others, and for His purpose.      Here is one example of a praise song I have been listening to tonight... May you all enjoy its words...    ------------------------------------------------------------------------       Down          at the Cross       What can I boast about   When the life that I live has been given me   What can I be proud of   But of Jesus who died to set me free    Set me free            Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom           Let not the strong man boast in his strength           Let not the rich man boast in his riches           For all men are equal down at the cross              Jesus still reaches out           No matter how far or how weak we are           His love has no bounds           and He reaches the ones down on their knees...          On their knees              Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom           Let not the strong man boast in his strength           Let not the rich man boast in his riches           For all men are equal down at the cross              Down at the cross come and leave all your pride           Lay everything at His feet           For all of us He was willing to die           Even when we were weak           When we were still without strength           When we were set in our ways           When we were filled with hatred for Him           Still He was willing to die for you and I              Down at the cross              -------------------------------------------------------------------------     According to the group, The Kry's offical  urlLink website , the song is based on the following verses:      Jeremiah 9:23-24;   Phillippians 3:7-8;   Romans 5:6-8 ;  Galatians 6:14

      First, I would like all readers to note that I have added two links under "Fav Blogs".  I have recently discovered the last two titled,  Messy Christian  &  What If I Stumble  and have admired the writers' thoughts, whether I personally agreed with them or not.    Next, here is another blog I have discovered through  Messy Christian , simply referenced as being  WAYNE'S BLOG .  I personally enjoy this blog as well as  Messy Christian  because they both express how more and more Christians are realizing the potentially negative effects that organized religion may be having on Christianity as a whole. I will review this blog further to confirm whether I wish to include it on my list also.    The effects of organized religion and the fact that others feel similarily as I did (as shown on my previous entry), confirms that my negative experiences during the beginning of my college years was not of my own doing, and that it was understandable why I may have distanced myself away from further full-time commitment to another church and needed time to heal.    I enjoy  What If I Stumble , because it displays the writer as being well-spoken and intelligent, especially on issues of social and political significance in relation to Christianity. It is what may be known as a  pundit ... a category that has officially been established among Christian bloggers.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------    I am very sleepy and tired today, especially after I returned from being with my grandmother at her church, like I had mentioned in my prior entry. She was happy to see all of us, and she is such a sweet and loving grandmother.    First, I came home to browse some magazines and an IKEA catalog. (remember how an IFSJ loves the idea of an aesthetic home???)    Then, I watched 2 hours of America's Funniest Home Videos and laughed my butt off... the random things that can happen when people are just trying to relax/have fun/LIVE.      NOW, I am watching a re-run of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition... (another IFSJ moment!)    and... today, I am more tired than usual, so there is not as much energy given to write a L-O-N-G and descriptive entry about emotions, religion, and relationships... as well as my daily life.     Just a quickie on what's happened... TODAY.    good night, y'all!

      I had orignally started composing a rather lengthy and complicated entry a couple of nights ago.       I was going on and on about how I felt about a deep issue.  However, whatever got composed also got lost.   oh well.     It may end up being better to simplify it all anyways... It may still be a long entry, but with a different balance in content... (wink)   so....   NOW, I feel like I can FINALLY commit to a wondeful church with PASSION... and God was saying "yay!" as well as helping me see the reasons behind it...      **For the majority of my time in college, I dealt with an unstable situation at a certain church that I had attended. However, I was very sensitive to confusing situations.     To explain: the first pastor may have insisted on borderline spiritual abuse, and the next pastor may have insisted on severe traditionalism in regards to dress, conduct, and relationships.     Therefore, I personally felt that I did not receive genuine Christian love. It felt more like a place to attend where I felt fear, discomfort, and guilt if I were to consider leaving... and afterwards, due to the impact that issues regarding spirituality had on me, it took even longer to heal and move on...**   NOW, I feel I may have finally found a church where I do not feel self-conscious or awkward. I can chat with others who are close in age and who have similar goals and personalities. I sincerely feel God's presence during service and fellowship. It has taken the last two years to finally open up my heart PASSIONATELY to such an opportunity.    Although in the past, I favored a setting where the focus was not strongly on Asian American cultural identity, now is a time when I feel that I am more confident about who I am in Jesus. As a result, considering commitment to a Korean American church with a large Korean immigrant congregation among older adults does not appear to be intimidating.    I am reflecting upon all this, as Saturday ends and Sunday will soon begin. I feel that I can finally look up to the sky to where I believe heaven is, and say, "I'm ready to move on and accept what YOU have for me."    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   Tomorrow, I will not be attending the church in reference, however, because I will attend my grandmother's church for her 81st birthday.     I hope to be there to show my love to her, because without that wonderful lady, I would not have my father... and... therefore, I also would not be in existence at this very moment.    She has worked hard to SURVIVE and to provide the basic needs of life for my uncle and my father as a single mother in South Korea during the aftermath of the Korean War.    I look up to her for her consistent display of strength physically and mentally. In a society where a woman's role is still traditionalized and many females are still struggling to prove their equality to men, my grandmother prevailed and we all owe her our gratitude.    My father continues to insist that my presence tomorrow at church is all that's needed, and yet that still surprises me. I had intended on buying a decent card for her with a few simple Korean phrases and a quick signature from both my brother and I.    I guess it's clear that it's an American tradition to show affection through a present and/or at least a card. For Koreans, it's best to show up for a small get-together and just be PRESENT. (grin)    So, that's where I'll be... and may my granny live to be 100!

      Unfortunately, I forgot to go over the necessary Scripture and readings for TODAY's daily devotionals ahead of time.     Those have been helping SO MUCH.  It helps me hold onto the Lord's presence as I am facing this job with such nervousness...    I finally realized  another  probable reason for my heightened nervousness when more people are around...    I'm nervous about what others' first impressions will be, being in a new environment.....and, I work "better" in a quiet and peaceful setting (which i finally did today for awhile).    However, I need to have faith in the Lord and know that His presence will be what shines through.      "Blessed are the poor in spirit,   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.     Blessed are those who mourn,   for they will be comforted.     Blessed are the meek,   for they will inherit the earth.     Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,   for they will be filled.     Blessed are the merciful,   for they will be shown mercy.     Blessed are the pure in heart,   for they will see God.     Blessed are the peacemakers,   for they will be called sons of God.        Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. "    -Matthew 5:3-10   (The Beatitudes)      Scripture to hold onto as I seriouly consider staying at this job after searching for it through my personal efforts... and feeling like I am becoming a young adult.    I am never ever going to forget what my family and esp. my father have done for me, but i am at a phase where life needs to be taken care of on my own through God's guidance.    so, today was peaceful and a bit more relaxing... we'll see what tomorrow will bring as I continue to ask for the Lord's power and blessing...    May all of you have a great week.

      I just came back from ANOTHER day of work...  and the difference in atmosphere...  all i can say is...wow.    Tuesdays through Thursdays are when EVERYONE in the dept. is there, because most full-timers either take Mon. or Fri. off and have 10 hour shifts... they have a particular schedule.    I am not joking y'all... there is a total of 3... maybe 4 Asians that work in the ENTIRE vincinity of Commerce City Hall. I'm pretty sure I'm the only Korean too... The other Asians look like they're Chinese or Japanese...     (Asian have a slightly better  sense to these things, right?  ;p)    I saw an unfamiliar Asian female walk in the break room to eat her lunch today... and I'm guessing she's either new, or someone I haven't seen around due to location, etc.    C'mon... I'm in the middle of LA County... the majority of my co-workers are Hispanic. not that it's a problem, because I have met many friendly individuals...    But, I am so-o not used to it. I don't know if any of you know my job history... but I've worked in Korean if not Asian law firms in Koreatown/downtown LA.... for the past year since college graduation.    Maybe, THAT's what is contributing to my heightened nervousness!  (ding ding ding!)      (writing all this out is helping me THINK!)      maybe on the weekend, i can write more powerful entries... but because I am now in the midst of getting acquainted with my new job... it's time to spill the details to those who are willing. hee hee!    I DO have to admit that it is easier to communicate, joke, and befriend those who are not Asian. I've been telling all who have met me  casually  (ex. not @ work), that I am a self-professed "banana".  (yellow = skin... white= basis for mind, emotions, etc.)    however... i have not been placed nor have i placed myself in such a mulit-racial situation so quickly and openly before.... so i hope my being nervous as well as the potential for an intense spiritual attack will disappear... (me and God have been getting close this month or so!)    I must remember my daily devotionals! Today's was about what it would be like if we all hold and focus onto the Lord's presence...     "but those who hope in the LORD     will renew their strength.     They will soar on wings like eagles;     they will run and not grow weary,     they will walk and not be faint."  -Isaiah 40:31    Something to definitely remember in an unfamilar situation...    Other than that, hopefully a steady paycheck will help ease things a little on the practical side... (and I kinda wanna get access to a pool so i can "workout"! argh.)    hope the rest of y'all have a wonderful week!

      For those who may not have read my prior entries on how I was able to gain employment at a nearby city hall...    You can now read a brief description of how my first OFFICIAL day went.    sigh.    I think a couple of outside factors as well as aspects of the job, contributed to how tired I am feeling now.    It was the first day that my DIRECT supervisor was there... and although there were no direct conflicts nor negative first impressions...    She went over various complicated processes in great detail... and it eventually drained me because of my efforts to remember almost all details ...    However, I was able to verify that she indeed is a strong believer of the Christian faith...   (I had originally heard about it last Friday...)    As for outside factors....  I felt that I should have gotten better-quality sleep... as well as the contributing factor that I am waiting for a medication refill...    Hopefully, as time passes... and I become more accustomed and knowledgable about everything...as well as gain better rest and maintain my health strongly...    I must also do my best to put faith in the Lord and His power.    My daily devotional was focusing on that aspect --  The Lord will not FORCE  faith or trust... a believer must know and acknowledge His presence...      Good night everyone... time to go relax.

      Well, folks... I've been praying about long-term commitment to Los Angeles Christian Presbyterian Church. (my cousin Annette's church)    So, I started to think about what would be important to me in making such a decision, and why I was personally, always so nervous in new surroundings, despite the clear presence of God. Therefore....    I randomly decided to take multiple personality tests, one being the famous Myers-Briggs Test, and I am the following personality type:      urlLink  ISFJ     (I=Introverted /   S=Sensing / F = Feeling / J = Judging)       If y'all click on the the blue letters above, it will show that it is also a link to a very detailed description of that personality type... anyone have enough time to read it? (hee hee!)   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Anyways, I will try to summarize as best as I can, what the "experts" are saying:      Basically, I prefer to be alone or spend time only with close family and dear friends. I would rather think carefully vs. react quickly. This may explain why I have the potential in keeping clear memories of people, places, and events that bring on strong emotions. Sometimes, a certain facial expression or a phrase can even be remembered in high detail for years. This can bring a potential inability to "forgive, forget and let go".     Decisions and judgements tend to be made on "tried and true" methods. Such notions as new theories and abstract concepts are not preferred. This explains why I focus more on what's going on "now" and getting things done as soon as possible, in areas such as academics and the workplace. If I am forced with an unknown situation, I often like to discuss and think about things in great depth before making a final decision.     (I think with what's been happening recently emotionally and spiritually, this BLOG has been my outlet for deep thought and "discussion"!      UPDATE - 7/26/04 : ISFJ's do indeed need outlets for expression, because they tend to normally internalize it all first... and finally need a place to release... i.e. julie's outlet = writing!)    I am generally known as the "Nurturer", because I am very sensitive and do my best to be sensitive to others. I like to be "needed" and for others to feel the same way. Generally, I am seen as being polite and considerate to those I meet and know less intimately. Deep commitment are given to people and things I find myself identifying closely with.     I like for things to be neat and organized, as well as aesthetic and pleasing to the eye. For example, when building the ideal family home, I may concentrate on colors, patterns, furniture placement, and general room organization in specific and great detail. I also like to be on time, and I like to make sure that everything's organized and that "all bases are covered".  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Examples of ideal careers are:   interior designers   counselors  religious workers  social workers  librarians teachers/educators  adminstrators/management  clerks/secretaries  nursing  general medicine    Since, I've been starting to consider a writing career... I truly feel that being reflective and a deep thinker will help considerably! *grin*   All of this may help explain the following habits/personality aspects:  I L-O-V-E watching home makeover shows; I am so freakishly neat; I try so hard to support such friends like Hana, acquaintances like Sam, and my family; I have had a habit of not easily letting go of certain things in my past...   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------    I hope this will clarify how being a unique individual displays the power of God's creation...      so that earnest prayer and His word will help me make the final decision in regards to a church.  (I want to show commitment and support to a church too!)    "Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. In Him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in Him you too are being built together: to become a dwelling in which God lives by His Spirit."   Ephesians 2:19-22   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Here's a picture of someone famous who has the same personality...

      Another main issue:   my relationship with my father.    (Note: I felt this issue was important to share with EVERYONE who frequents this blog, so I edited an email I sent to another fellow Christian, so that it would deal directly with me only...)      Out of all three members of my immediate family, my father is the one I closely identify with.  he is the one I take after, and he is the one who understands alot of my emotions and thoughts.    however, all day today, he has been  getting easily frustrated and easily angered by me.  It finally hit a peak about twenty minutes ago.      I think he is indirectly  showing me that he is needing emotional space (I have depended on him  considerably when I wasn't doing so well recently), or there are other things  going on with his life, and his normal level of patience has decreased  considerably.      Perhaps, those of you who are also Asian American, may be able to relate to the  experience of having fathers who see that their children must be accounted for  physically and economically, yet who appear to not recognize and realize such  factors as emotional and mental health.       Here's a verse that I "tried" to discuss with  my father tonight:     "Listen, my son, to your father's instruction  and do not forsake your mother's teaching.  They will be a garland to grace your  head and a chain to adorn your neck."     Proverbs 1: 8 &amp; 9       I was trying to show him that no matter what I  may do or say occasionally, that I would ALWAYS respect him as my father.  I  thought that using the Bible would help because he is a strong believer and is intensely involved with his  church.     However, he is also intensely emotionally stoic and withdrawn.  Warmth,  compassion, and affection.... do not describe my father's  temperament.       I've just finished praying to the Lord about  my father, and I feel that the Lord is trying to tell me the  following....       That my father finds it absolutely difficult  to be open and expressive in regards to the deep love he has for me.  He shows  it in other ways.  For example, he shows his devotion, by aggressively ensuring  that I am accounted for in terms of my physical health and with a decent  job.       Perhaps, the Lord is bringing this issue out  for me to deal with and reflect upon right now, because the Lord desires that I  understand my father in the best way, instead of being resentful, angry, and  ungrateful.      He is really trying to cleanse my heart of all that lingers that is  linked with past bitterness and He wants me to have a "clean  slate"!       I feel that the Lord is asking me to show  unconditional love to my father as well as to my family, in the way He shows His  love to me.  He is humbling me and asking that I understand my earthly  father.      This is another issue to work out with the Lord, so that I may achieve true peace and joy in His name.      May the Lord watch over us all as we continue on with this weekend!

      As consistently mentioned, I must work even harder to maintain strong spiritual health by putting God #1...   but I have also realized that I should also maintain and stabilize my physical well-being.   I have realized that more earnest efforts need to be made to be physically in shape, which will require substantial weight loss.   So, I have started with several things....   Early bedtime, routine exercise, healthy eating habits, and even more constructive methods of relieving stress.   I have already mentioned that I have accompanied my father almost every morning by 7 am, to a nearby park to take a quick walk around.   I have also acquired a strong desire to gain access to a nearby pool, so that I may begin strong swimming workouts.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as my paychecks from my new job are received, I will pursue this actively.   I remember the feeling of gaining muscle and feeling like weight was slowly slipping off during my first two years of high school, when I was somewhat involved with the school swim team.   I have also begun to go to bed by 10 - 11 pm, so that I may rise by 6 - 8 am.   (Most of my peers who know me well, would probably think... what?! *chuckle*)   I have also begun to eat less fried foods, and&nbsp;have&nbsp;eaten such food as light sandwhiches,&nbsp;salads and fruit. I still do not desire to go for the low-carb diet due to my concern over my slightly fragile health.   I will confess what may be hard initially to be open about:  As mentioned before, I am still dealing with a minor form of epilepsy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything stated above will&nbsp;hopefully stabilize my health and levels of stress, and will most importantly, help the occasional and unexpected seizure to eventually disappear.  &nbsp;  (I have had seizures even with stable medication... which gives enough reason for substantial concern and strong efforts for a healthier lifestyle.)    As of late June, I have been advised by a neurosurgeon, to gain more extensive control over my health to better control my seizures, because my small and benign brain "tumor" has not grown since the beginning of my epilepsy in 1997-1998. In other words, surgery, a biopsy, and/or other special treatment is NOT urgently needed.    It is only a matter of having better habits for myself. I will try my ABSOLUTE hardest to not fail. It has already been noted by family members, who do not hesitate to be blunt, that I have lost approximately 20 pounds.... plus, the scale says so also, and that device does NOT lie. (wink)   As stated clearly&nbsp;in prior entries, I will also listen to more music that will help me feel more at ease, and I will extensively read inspiring novels. I have decided to blog more often as you may already be&nbsp;able to tell, not for "show and tell", but because it is easier and healthier on EVERYONE,&nbsp;especially myself, if I&nbsp;outlet my emotions and describe daily experiences in this way.&nbsp; And... blogging will help me gain confidence in writing.&nbsp; Writing is still seen as my strong passion for my life.   I would also like to occasionally visit the nearby shoreline... the last time I was driving by the beach was when I had that wonderful revelation about my brother's never-ending love for me, as his sister, depsite his own strong struggles. The waves, the beautiful horizon, and the crisp air do wonderful things to my mind and senses.   Finally, I will do my best to hold onto the truth that the LORD loves me, and that this is enough to start a new job, go forward in life, and to pursue the RIGHT future with all the confidence and boldness that I can gain through His name.   I will also pray for those of you on my "list" and read the Word so that I can be reminded of His love for all of you, and of His overall purpose....  &nbsp;  (AGAIN, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO ASK ME&nbsp; FOR PRAYER!)   May all of us and our overall well-being be placed in His amazing hands.&nbsp;

       Below is a picture of a CD I'm also enjoying consistently by Chris Tomlin titled, "Not to Us".          Here's a link to his official   urlLink website .    One song that I enjoy, is also titled "Not to Us".  The lyrics are as follows:   The cross before me, the world behind  No turning back, raise the banner high  It's not for me  It's all for You   Let the heavens shake and split the sky  Let the people clap their hands and cry  It's not for us  It's all for You   Not to us  But to Your name be the glory  Not to us  But to Your name be the glory   Our hearts unfold before Your throne   The only place for those who know  It's not for us   It's all for You   Send your holy fire on this offering  Let our worship burn for the world to see  It's not for us  It's all for You   Not to us  But to your name be the glory  Not to us  But to your name be the glory   The earth is shaking  The mountains shouting  It's all for You  The waves are crashing  The sun is raging  It's all for You   The universe  Spinning and singing  It's all for You  Your children dancing, dancing, dancing  It's all for You  It's all for You  My all for You   Not to us  But to your name... (repeat)

       "Such  confidence  as this is ours through Christ before God."   2 Corinthians 3:4      Again, God's word must be the MAIN source of wisdom and inspiration, as I reflect back on today.    I need to have confidence that comes from the Lord, because I consistently was nervous about my performance and how I was viewed by others during my FIRST day... which can either be viewed as normal or exaggerated depending on differing points of view.      Officially, I am an administrative assistant working for the Planning Division of the Community Development Dept. in the City Hall of Commerce. (think zoning laws, business licenses, etc.)   it will be determined if things can go possibly long-term after a certain period of time...

      Before I surrender the computer over to my mother (who loves paying bills online!)...  and before I do my best to go to bed ASAP so that I can wake up early to go for a morning walk with my father...  I had some final thoughts for tonight.  job interviews have appeared, hospital bills have begun to be taken care of somehow, and relationships also appear to improving... making life somewhat simpler and definitely more peaceful.  Doesn't God make a big diff?  Now, if only I can eventually get to the point where I lean on Him with all my might, my concentration, and my heart... so that I do NOT bother/lean on/approach other people as much as I do now.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Lord,   I still know that I am going to others often, even those who are either physically and/or emotionally not very close.    MAY I STOP LEANING ON OTHERS  NOW  IN THE NAME OF JESUS!!!  Please help me be humble, to be mature, and to be a confident woman of God... and may I start to do my best to SHARE your love... especially if I am beginning to start feeling a desire for missions to such people like Native Americans, grow deep within my heart again.  Amen.

          (A Navajo-made pendant)    I have always had deeper respect towards Native Americans.  Ever since high school, when I went on a short-term missions trip to Arizona to evangelize to Native Americans within a Navajo reservation, I have always felt my own special connection with Native Americans.  I really liked the film titled, "Smoke Signals".  It was about two very different guys dealing with their identities as being young, NATIVE AMERICAN, and male.  Issues such as relationships with each other, with their parents, with their community, and their own self-worth were all significant, making it all very easy for me to relate to.  Here's a picture:        I also really enjoy the songs of Steven Curtis Chapman.  On his album titled, "Declaration" he writes and dedicates the song titled "No Greater Love" to the missionarys of the natives of Ecuador named the Waodoni.  I have been listening to this song over and over again!  lol!     Here's Steven's own message in regards to the song:  "Dedicated to the memory of Nate Saint and his four missionary friends and their families who lived and died to make the great love of God through Christ known to the Waodoni of Ecuador.  Your story of faith and obedience still impress and challenges all who know it..."  To summarize:  Nate Saint and everyone else traveled down to Ecuador to spread the Gospel in 1956, when the natives mistaking them for odd-looking enemies/aliens speared them to death, acting in fear and ignorance.  One of those natives, named Mincaye has now accepted Christ as his Saviour and agreed to sing a part of this song in his own native tongue, and through the power of God ended up chanting and singing in the right key, with no assistance, etc.  Here are the lyrics:  Man of courage with your message of peace What is that look in your eyes? Why have you come to this faraway place? What is this story you would lay down your life to tell? What kind of love can this be?  There is no greater love than this There is no greater gift that can ever be given To be willing to die so another might live There is no greater love than this  Broken hearted from all you have lost How can you sing through your tears What is this music that can bear such a cost? What is this fire that grows stronger against the wind? What kind of flame can this be?  There is no greater love than this There is no greater gift that can ever be given To be willing to die so another might live There is no greater love than this  This is the love that God showed the world When He gave us His Son So we could know His love forever Beyond the gates of splendor  There is no greater love than this There is no greater gift than can ever be given To be willing to die so another might live There is no greater love than this  There is no greater love...    "The Creation/Heaven Song" (Mincaye's Song)  God, creating from nothing, has made all the things around us. While our hearts are beating and we are alive, let's all believe. Believe without being afraid. I also to God's place am going. We believers are going to God's place. Let us all believe that. How can it be that we will go? If we are clean in our hearts, then let's be out of here. We, the believing ones, shall go up to God's place. All of us believers who are still living, we will be saying to ourselves,  "We want to go up to God's place"

          Where there is love There is a peace And in the cages that bind the bitter heart It is release Hold it close to your chest Let it move, and let it rest For it is here to set your mind at ease Where there is love There is a peace  Where there is hope There is a dream To rise above, to remit, and to redeem To go back, to go where  There's no anger there To find the song That you once could sing Where there is hope There is a dream  Where there is faith There is a chance To alter the course And fight the winds of circumstance Not to scar, but to mend Not to break, but to bend And not to know, but to understand Where there is faith There is a chance  Where there is hope There is a dream  Where there is love There is a peace...   This is another beautiful song that is speaking to me...  I will add more more later... tonight blogger was down for a couple of hours...

        "In you, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame. Rescue me and deliver me in your righteousness; turn your ear to me and save me. Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go; give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress..."    It's one thing to SEE what you need to do to gain peace through God.  It's another to actually DO something about it.  Ever heard something similar to, "You can talk the talk, but can you walk the walk?"  For a week already, I have clearly realized the following: I have depended too much on others, whether it be for approval or assistance.  I have also ignored the Lord's presence.. and it's caused me to assume that when everyone else could not match my impossible levels of expectations, that they did not care for me.  I had consistently refused to see how others and ultimately, God loved me.  But, last night, when I spoke with Hana, I finally was able to be honest & open with her, and we both agree that this will bring peace & love in our relationship because of what the Lord has done for us.  I may have already stated that she's a close friend.  As for being my best friend, I sincerely believe that it is fair for all parties involved to mutually agree on such a classification... and I hope for that to happen in the future.  She is the first one that I have sincerely apologized to.  I have unfairly and unrealistically tried to replace GOD with her, other friends, and my family.  The Lord MUST and SHOULD be the FIRST to go to at all times.  Various aspects in my life, whether they be as simple as getting enough rest... to something deeper such as relationships,  need to be PLACED AT HIS FEET. For example, I should not be calling her, almost every time I feel anger, sadness & fear.   The Lord has been sadly ignored and pushed away, because of my own and long-lasting misunderstandings of Him.  Various things that were not readily understood or that had been abnormally difficult for myself, should have been viewed as lessons that could not be taught in another way...or simply, a significant part of God's plan.   I should have also earnestly sought continuous peace & joy in my life.    She has been so patient with me.  I thank the Lord for helping me to see the true beauty in her and everyone else dear to me, such as someone like my brother...  **GOD HAS BROUGHT HER IN MY LIFE, TO HELP OPEN MY EYES TO HIS LOVE AND POWER.**  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lord,   May my life be devoted to YOU and YOU ONLY.  May I give you the ultimate praise for helping me see clearly.  I will do my ultimate best to trust in You with all my strength, and to boldy gain a new vision for my life...because YOU are so awesome & unfailing.  May I become a strong, confident and joyful young woman of God.  And may I thank you for bringing wonderful friends and family in my life.    May I achieve consistent happiness & peace, because I realize that the SECOND I proclaimed Jesus to be my Saviour, that my life has never, ever been the same... and that You will never, ever leave me.  May God receive all the glory.  Amen.

      By Steven Curtis Chapman (Greatest Hits CD)      The sun sinks low and here I go Wrestling with questions that refuse an answer This path of faith can be a place So barren of what I understand I can hear the voice of fear Saying let me show you another way So I cry out my Lord, Jesus It's in Your love for me I find all that I need   So where else could I turn And where else could I go You have given me life You have made me whole You have rescued my soul So where else could I go  For I AM FOUND IN YOU   I may not see in front of me But I can see for miles when I look over my shoulder And Lord, it's clear  You've brought me here  So faithful every step of the way What can I do but follow You For You are the Way, the Truth, the Life And You've promised never to leave me My Saviour, my friend From beginning to end   So where else could I turn And where else could I go You have given me life You have made me whole You have rescued my soul So where else could I go For I AM FOUND IN YOU   Lord, without You This child would be so lost But I've been found in You And now I'm bound to You By the love that You've shown It will not let me go   So where else could I turn And where else could I go You have given me life You have made me whole You have rescued my soul So where else could I go For I have found in You All I've been made for So there's no where else I could go I AM FOUND IN YOU     I am very grateful and blessed by the Lord.  Allowing His presence to become the MAIN focus has dramatically changed my life already in just the span of one week.  After this Monday's trip, things between my brother and I have slowly improved.  We listen to each other more, and more respect and love is shown... and I am so-o glad.  Also, I truly do feel such peace in my heart.  It's affecting other relationships in such a wonderful way... the Lord deserves all the glory and praise.  I am tired now, after a day spent with family... so, I'm going to go to bed and visit my cousin's church tomorrow.  I hope all of you continue to have a great weekend!

      Today was an interesting day.  First I got up one hour earlier than usual to accompany my father for a morning walk.  We cruised the neighborhood park while chatting, and watching ducks waddle together.  Then, I got to go to a small-scale job fair in downtown LA.  It was specifically geared towards Asian-Americans.   I ensured I hit all the "right" tables.  So, I was able to talk to representatives from the US Dept. of State, the Social Security Administration, the LA City Personnel Dept., as well as a few other private organizations.  Working within the government, whether it be federal, state, or just municipal is still an option.  Then, my father and I went to nearby Koreatown to grab kalbi-tang (think hot beef soup), and then I came home to watch Oprah.  I have to admit, I am not normally inclined to be attracted to celebrities and actors, but after watching such films as "Troy", "King Arthur", "The Notebook", and etc...  it was easier for me to closely pay attention to an interview with Brad Pitt ...  hee hee!  Also, in the course of the past two days, I have received two phone calls... one from a large Korean company with a small US branch in LA, and another one from a media/advertising company that's nearby my home.  It won't hurt to go for an interview... and then I can decide later if either job will be ok.  My father and I spent a substantial amount of time recently, and I think he's appreciating the fact that I've realized what I have in terms of what I mentioned in the last entry.  He's probably thinking... "FINALLY!"  I thank the Lord that I have a strongly involved father, because despite his own habit of being emotionally stoic, I have FINALLY realized how his love is shown towards me...   and that is in addition to what I am slowly realizing in the truest sense.... that the Lord loves me and will NEVER, EVER leave me.  So, I thank the Lord for His presence, and for giving me several individuals who have either said a quick prayer... or sincerely listened to me when I asked them to suddenly listen ( i tend to have a habit of babbling & depending on others)...  I need to really go to the Lord... and CALM DOWN... in His presence, I will try to finally be peaceful.  I am now going to rest and watch the Olympic swimming trials.  I want to see actual professional swimmers swim such strokes as the breaststroke and the butterfly and feel my jaw drop open in awe.  I need to start swimming again... I miss the feeling in my arms and shoulders that lingered after high school swim practice... and I miss the refreshing feeling of having been in cool water for an extended amount of time.  I MISS BEING IN (semi) SHAPE...  have a great weekend!

       Psalm 23   "The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not be in want.  He makes me lie down in green pastures,  He leads me beside quiet waters,  He restores my soul.  He guides me in the path of righteousness for His name's sake.   Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  I will fear no evil,  For you are with me;  Your rod and your staff,  They comfort me.   You prepare a table before me   in the presence of my enemies.  You anoint my head with oil;   my cup overflows.  Surely goodness & love will follow me all the days of my life,  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever..."   I am earnestly meditating on the meaning of this psalm as I listen to "I Can Only Imagine", the song that inspired me to start this site.  I have been quietly reflecting on what my life has been this past year after college graduation.  The Lord often uses the most unexpected time, people, & objects to open my own eyes.   I have finally realized the one thing that has been stopping me from achieving TRUE PEACE through the Lord.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This personal "revelation" happened on Monday, when my family and I cruised the southern California coast, stopped by Solvang, and cruised back down to Los Angeles.  I had to deal with my brother directly and consistently the whole day, since he was either sitting next to me, or behind me in the car.  Usually, if things get bad enough, we have these screaming matches, with NO ONE giving in... and both of us demanding to be heard & understood.  As I looked out the window, I listened to soothing Christian music, and slowly let my eyes enjoy the crashing waves, the distinctive rocks, & the happy birds of the quiet beaches that we were passing...  I also slowly began to realize what would make things between my brother and I completely better.   I NEEDED TO STOP ASSUMING THAT MY BROTHER DID NOT LOVE ME.   I finally realized why so many fights had happened.  It's true that my brother has his own deep issues, and that I am not the only one who has struggled to help him overcome such issues.  But, I always got upset, hurt, & angry, because I thought the clear display of his own difficulty in handling himself, as well as his "unique" sense of humor ( i.e. swear words & certain finger = joke), was because he hated me.  I'm almost tearing up as I type these words.  All those times when I could have been strong & calm because of the Lord's love & presence, I let myself think I was being attacked & hated.   my brother, calm beaches, & peaceful music helped me realize this "burden" I had been carrying around in regards to ALL of my relationships.  whether it be friends, acquaintances, co-workers, family, crushes, church members....  I ALWAYS found an excuse to think that they were all out to hurt me because they did not like/love me...even my parents.   as i remembered various relationships and events in my life, i also realized that things would have been completely different if I had realized that God had brought certain people and events to show HIS love... he had not placed certain people in my life, so that i could overwhelm or mistrust them.  only recent relationships have been strong and positive.  realizing that my brother loves me, despite the many struggles he has and will overcome, has brought such PEACE to my heart.  I regret certain things I've said or that I've done... to certain people and in certain situations.    The Lord has used my daily struggles with my brother to open my eyes to my very L-O-N-G and bad habit of mistrust & extreme sensitivity.  and... as I look back on Psalm 23 and listen to "I Can Only Imagine"...   The Lord will be THE ONE that I shall go to for comfort, love, and PEACE.  I have realized that the Lord has always given all of us unconditional love, especially through His son, Jesus Christ.  I have also finally realized the strong efforts that close family & friends have shown to each other and to me to love unconditionally, and I feel such strength of mind & heart, and I have begun to see the direction that the Lord is leading me towards.  I was not supposed to go to law school from the beginning.  If I can feel such inspiration, confidence, and passion from WRITING about deep issues in my life...    how can i be in a profession that requires me to consistently prove myself, and argue for other individuals?  I must use more free and creative ways to express what is deep within my heart.  I cannot memorize laws, codes, & legal vocabulary.    "I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.  The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me."  -Galatians 2:20     I must now go and spend time in prayer... and I must hold onto the written words of this entry close...so that I may NEVER forget what the Lord has done to show that He has never left me... and that He has always been providing for me.  I must now show my dedication and commitment to a God that has been so loving and wonderful....

      I had this wonderful entry thought out...with no intention of changing anything... I had liked it all the way it was.  However, my computer's been giving me problems.  It's specifically due to Internet Explorer itself, because when I use Netscape, I have no problems.  Actually, would anyone be knowledgeable enough to help?  I have trouble maneuvering from site to site, especially when it is a link that requires a new window to be opened.  Several of you have left lovely comments... and I was only able to see on my commenting host's website  urlLink  Haloscan .  Thanks!!!  Also, since it was much easier for me to maneuver with everything all on one page (technically), the comments are still accessible, but now it is through  urlLink Blogger  directly.  This new design is nice anyways... kind of refreshing for a warm July, doncha think?  will do my best to finish off all the details... and now my profile's available too... i still need to make sure it's all "seamless" and that I add my fav websites... i did add my fav blogs tho.  (can anyone tell how i like to be organized? ;p )  maybe i will finally fix it... and if not... there's always an alternative.

      A quick note before I go to work this morning:  I have added a new link to a great website that gives free services.  It counts how many people visit your website, and I believe it also gives information on where and how people visit.  Just something to have so that one knows when and how people visit your site.  It's just sad to see that as of this moment (8:25 am on 8/11/04), that only FOUR people have visited (which probably were all ME), when I've had this blog for TWO years.  Time to check my site out my lovely friends!  (wink)  I will refine it and adjust it later if I desire.  Have a wonderful day everyone!

      True confidence will only come from God.  Why?  Because I have tried to gain confidence on my own ever since I was old enough to "think", and I have failed miserably.  Only recently, have I realized how much more my dreams appear to be obtainable and concrete when I place all of them in God's hands.  Therefore, I want to laugh, smile, joke, and work hard as a living, breathing, and walking creation of God.  May He give me wisdom, strength, and focus so that I can leap over this last hurdle...  So that I may become a VIBRANT, PASSIONATE, AND  CONFIDENT  woman of God.  I must have faith that EVERYTHING happens because it is all under God's will and power.  (Note: I will be more specific and detailed  in my next entry... Tonight, I must read, reflect, and pray!)

      I must savor life.  I worry about it WAY too much instead.   For example, I must do my best to keep up with the upcoming Olympics in Athens.  here is their website:  urlLink Athens 2004   The excitement of all the different events with many nations participating, the pace of extreme athletes who excel in their physical skill and achievements, and the rush of pace to have it all be within one city...  how exciting....  I am going to follow the swimming events closely... it's the only sport that is interesting me anyways.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  I am actually quite tired. I have emotionally been up and down today due to a hectic and emotional atmosphere at home, and because I am feeling vulnerable and incompetent at work.  For example, I allow people, situations, and tasks at work overtake the possibility in enjoying what is already around me such as the pace of the office or the interesting people that walk by.  However, God has helped me to see that I am to learn more about what true humility in the Lord's name is, as I realize that my achievements as a college graduate has caused me to have a "big head"....  May I allow God's presence to rule my actions, thoughts, and emotions... I MUST prove to everyone that I am a child of God as I ....  SAVOR THE LIFE THAT  HE  HAS GIVEN UNTO ME.  Time to relax, smile, and be confident through the Lord's presence.

      I  regret  my actions at work today.  I had been easily bored and unhappy, first by a lack of activity, and then by two difficult patrons who had visited Commerce City Hall (my workplace).  OOPS.  I usually have one or two people I feel I can confide in, whenever I am upset or even just bored.  However, there were even less employees within our department due to the additional number of co-workers who had taken the day off.  Instead of doing my best to lean on the Lord's presence and use my time wisely, I went around and gossiped and chatted with others who had been also working today. I most likely also was prideful in my manners and words because I had "felt" that I had handled everything well, according to my OWN skill, knowledge, and experience.  I regret doing so even more, because many of those I had visited were those I did not know very well.  What could have been a day that I could have lifted up in prayer to the Lord, was actually a day that I spent letting my sinful nature take over my thoughts and actions.  I definitely  regret  doing so, and I can feel the presence of God  rebuking  my actions.  I let my mind, mouth, and feet wander.  I can finally feel the Lord, His word, and His presence  rebuking  me and may I do the following:  Lord,  May you forgive my actions and words today. I did not show myself to be a true daughter of God. I showed myself as one who is easily irritated and frustrated. Instead of doing my best to glorify Your name by showing Your love, I did everything for my own benefit. May you forgive me once again. May I do my best to stay strong and pure according to the guidance of Your word and Your presence. May I work hard to be a TRUE child of God.  Amen.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  sigh.  This is what I expressed to my father as I came home tonight, and I feel it is best that I also express it here:  "I made a mistake in being so prideful and so easily angered. I know that this will cause  possible  opportunity for others to judge me, to spread gossip about me, and to change their opinions of me.  However, I must hold onto the Lord's presence, and continue to work hard and earnestly strive to be a dedicated employee. May my overall efforts to please the LORD, be what will FINALLY prove who I truly am before others... not my actions of today."  May I hold onto the above statement with strong conviction and dedication. It will be GOD and His presence, that will prove who I truly am among others who may not know Him.  May the Lord open my eyes to  regret ,  rebuke , and  to His wonderful wisdom.  Glory be to God ...

       Psalm 62: 1, 2, 5-8, 11, 12   My soul finds rest in God alone; My salvation comes from Him. He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my fortress, I will never be shaken.  ...Find rest, O my soul, in God alone; My hope comes from Him. He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my fortress, I will not be shaken. My salvation and my honor depend on God; He is my mighty rock, my refuge. Trust in Him at all times, O people; pour our your hearts to Him, for God is our refuge.  ...One thing God has spoken, Two things have I heard; that You, O God, are strong, and that You, O Lord, are loving. Surely You will reward each person according to what he has done.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Just a quick and additional note:  I have typed up the above psalm, as well as Psalm 139 from my previous entry titled, " urlLink Confidence ", and taped them on my computer at work. I MUST hold onto such beautiful words and use them to continue at this job, whether I stay quickly or not.  (i.e. I'm technically a temp)  These are words I MUST take with me, wherever I go, because they remind me clearly and consistenly of how God created me to be an unique and wonderful individual, and also of how much I can lean on Him whenever I desire comfort, mercy, and guidance.  May I strive my best to become a VIBRANT woman in GOD.   Writing has brought such clarity to deeper emotions and mixed thoughts. It helps me recognize what is truly coming out from my mind and heart, and it brings such peace.  May the Lord continue to teach me to be humble before others, and passionate for HIM.

      There is alot upon my mind and heart tonight.  I am doing my best to rest, smile, and move on.  To clearly explain: At work today, I had been instructed to send out 30 full packets of documents with certified mail receipts and return envelopes, a half hour before I was supposed to leave. Although, the one who had instructed me with the packets had given me sufficient time to finish (i.e. I had today and until 11 am tomorrow), I was greatly discouraged.  What they were not aware of, was that I was and still am quite tired from assisting the office with less co-workers available to support the workload.  They also were not aware of my health condition. I am a bit nervous in sharing openly about my health, because it has caused great vulnerability and controversy with those who had known from prior jobs, school, and even at a past church.  To put it simply: I have a very minor form of epilepsy due to what neurologists believe is a benign brain tumor in my right temporal lobe.  I had been falling asleep, tripping in my brief walks around the office, and most importantly, I had started to lose focus. I had even called a co-worker by the WRONG name! I was beginning to be afraid that I was in danger of having a minor petit-mal seizure.  I had briefly shared this situation with a co-worker, named MARIA,  in strict confidence , BEFORE I had received the packets, because I needed someone nearby to listen to my concern.  However, as soon as I came over to her desk to ask her if she knew where the certified mail receipts were located, she saw my face and expressions and immediately began to take over the job for me.  I saw how quickly she was starting the task, and how she gently refused even basic assistance from me, and I saw God's love shining through her efforts.  I look back on her actions, and I see such a clear display of  incredible, sweet love .  She has been anything but mean or impatient towards me, and I have only known her for the past 2 weeks.  She appeared and proved to be such a gentle and willing listener, so I have shared things in my life that are personal. Whether they be issues of concern or those that needed focus, she was willing to take a quick break from her apparently busy schedule.  When I am in a new setting, I have a tendency to need someone around to reassure me of my potential and standing. I know that God is working on my ability to be confident and passionate in His name, but it will take much time and effort to succeed joyfully and COMPLETELY.  Perhaps, He has brought Maria in my life, as an  incredible , and  sweet  example.

      Once again, I do not have much time to express my thoughts and emotions.  I have finally decided to commit to full-time membership at Los Angeles Christian Presbyterian Church.  I was initially introduced to this church through my cousin, who has been going there since junior high.  I enjoy the simple and peaceful atmosphere of the Sunday services and fellowship gatherings  of the English Minstry.  Almost everyone is close to my age, with all of us ranging from college freshmen to recently married couples with newborn babies.  I deeply admire the pastor's sermons, because he is well-spoken and clear. I am not only literally understanding his words, but I also grasp the deeper meaning of his sermons according to God's word and purpose.  I have been making sincere efforts to draw myself closer to God, and attending a church regularly has helped considerably.  I have begun to attend this church at a time when the English Ministry is experiencing transition, especially since the pastor has recently arrived. As a result, I do not feel as if I am left out, or abruptly arriving in the midst of it all.  Time to pray and reflect now.  Good night.

      I don't have much time tonight to describe deeply how much I've been inspired by another individual I had just met this afternoon at work. I must leave the computer soon, so that my family and I can get enough sleep.  His name is Jose Rodriguez, and it is amazing to meet in PERSON, one who is so artistically talented. He does not use computers, programs, or special tools... what he uses are his hands to create such pieces of art that bring joy and radiance to whomever looks upon them.  Here are two websites that display his work... I felt it would not be right to include pictures of his work without his permission.   urlLink http://www.sketchzone.com/   urlLink http://portfolios.com/profile.html?MyUrl=JoseRodriguez   Please, if there is anyone who desires to look at scanned copies of his actual artwork that are evidence of an extraordinary talent from a wonderful man who used to be an employee of Commerce City Hall, do not hesitate to visit the above websites.  There is one picture on the second website of a baseball player batting at home base that has such details of shadow, dimension, and light to it, that makes my jaw drop to the floor. I showed it to my father who didn't know it was "drawn", and he thought it was a photo!  I was so influenced by Jose, just by meeting him and being introduced to his work, because being an artist is who God had created him to be in such great depth and magnitude. He is a strong believer in God's purpose.  I was inspired through him to pursue my writing even more so, because I express myself most confidently and clearly through my writing. A whole different person comes out, and the best of what God has created me to be comes out in full strength.  And for Jose, he displays his identity in God, through his wonderful hands.

      Lord,  I acknowledge from the depths of my heart, that You love and cherish me.  I have begun to embrace Your word to be the rock that I must stand on.  However, Lord I continue to fail to stay confident in who I am as a young woman of God.  The beauty of Your creation and the unique details of Your handiwork have created who I am today.  Yet, I fail to see how wonderfully unique I am.  I continue to find fault with my character and personality.  I also fear that others around me find fault with how I work and express myself in a social setting.  Lord, tears are filling my eyes, as I remember how much pain I am feeling because I cannot value the simple beauty of being myself.  I cry out to you now...  I ask that you open my eyes and my mind.  I NEED to see how much YOU love me.  You are the only One who will NEVER cease to love me.  Even such details such as my sense of humor; my deep love for writing; my embrace of music, literature, and film; and being sensitve to others and to myself are ALL details that YOU created.  Why do I continue to find fault with such unique details?  Why do I refuse to see such things as being beautiful and valuable?  Why cannot the fact that YOUR love for me will never disappear, be enough for me to be always joyful?  Why must I let myself be deceived?  Why must I be convinced that I am unworthy and imperfect among others?  Lord, I ask in Your name that I be cleansed and renewed! May I not be distracted from achieving true peace as the woman You have created me to be.  Amen.

      I'm a bit apprehensive at the moment.  I shared this website's address with two co-workers, because they seemed to be those I could begin to trust. I respect them and enjoy their company. May God bless me through them.  However, due to my past experiences with a prior co-worker at my last law firm job, who appeared to use everything I shared in confidence, to my disadvantage, I am more hesitant to open up to others again... especially since this website is more a personal journal where I express my feelings, my thoughts, and my dreams.  I know I cannot close myself completey off, nor can I always be in fear because of what has already happened.  THEREFORE, MAY THE LORD PROTECT ME, COMFORT ME, AND REASSURE ME OF HIS AWESOME LOVE.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  "O Lord, you have searched me and you know me. You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar. You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with my ways. Before a word is on my tongue you know it completely, O Lord.  ...For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.  ... Search me, O God, and know my heart;   test me and know my anxious thoughts.   See if there is any offensive way in me,   and lead me in the way everlasting ."  -Psalm 139: 1-4; 13-14; 23-24   I will do my absolute best to search the word of God and fully take its meaning to be the foundation of my thoughts and actions, especially at the workplace, where I spend the majority of my time during the week.  This must not continue to be a matter of written word only.  My written words MUST become real through clear actions and deeds.  May the Lord bless my mind, heart, and spirit, as I do my BEST in bringing out the CONFIDENT, vibrant and passionate woman I know I already am, and who was made through God's hands.

      wow... Julie is writing up a storm tonight on this blog!  A total of three entries... I think it's because I haven't dumped anything on here for the past three days... (actually that kinda makes sense, cuz I've usually been writing an entry a day!)  But... I wanted to share with y'all how much I enjoyed the film titled, "October Sky".

      (for this week)  1) Pray as soon as I sit at my desk at work for: strength, wisdom, and the ability to focus on the Lord  2) Show God's love to others despite what they don't or do give back  3) Finding joy, peace, and calmness in being a MASTERPIECE OF  GOD   4) Thanking the Lord for at least one NEW thing each day  5) Spending time with the Lord through daily devotionals and prayer (esp. for those on my list...you know who you are! )

      "For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." Ephesians 2:10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Going to church today was so wonderful for me today.  It has been such a L-O-N-G time since I have truly enjoyed worshipping God.  Such factors as a need for fulfilling commitment or a fear of gulit,  have always been underlying reasons for attending church services for the past couple of years.   It was never solely because I enjoyed worshipping God and learning more about His word.   I think the last time I felt that I could truly enjoy Sunday worship was back in HIGH SCHOOL.  wow.  The above verse was used during the sermon, and it was the one point that impacted me most.    I am paraphrasing the pastor's words, but he stated the following and I feel as if my eyes have been truly opened...  God sees believers and their lives not as symbols of our own efforts, but as  masterpieces of  God ... Those who see us most, such as co-workers and family, must be able to see us prove ourselves as  masterpieces of  God  through the work that we do for and in His name...  wow.  uh, have I been believing and doing the above?  NO.  I have been over-analyzing relationships, over-criticizing myself, and over-worried over almost EVERYTHING.  I have not had faith in the Lord's work, especially in who He has created me to be as a Christian, and I have not had trust in what He will give and teach to me, in my life which is for the fulfillment of His purpose.  stuff to think about.  --------------------------------------------------------------  Lord,  May I be humble and sincere before you NOW.  I cry out to you now for forgiveness and mercy for always pursuing the approval of others and the world, when I should have realized that who I am already as Your child, is the ultimate blessing in itself.  May I live my life this week, doing my ulitmate best in showing others the beauty of Your handiwork.  I MUST stop beating myself up emotionally and mentally over thoughts, events, and interactions that do not deserve even a SECOND of concern.  Instead, may I fulfill Your purpose to the best of my ability in Your name.  Amen.
