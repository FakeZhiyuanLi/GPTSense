           Decisions, decisions…. sometimes they can truly be a pain in the derriere! When a friend of yours operates on a family member who also happens to be one of your employers and performs the surgery wrong, the question then becomes what do you do?  Well of course the surgery needs to be performed again, but who performs this time? Do allow the prior physician to rectify the problem, or seek out some other surgeon?   It’s a situation that places you in an awkward position for future work. It was not a life or death situation, and mistakes seem to happen often in hospitals today.   What I am saying and believe is that you should not let friends or employers operate on loved ones. If anything goes wrong, relationships may never be the same towards each other.  It may cause problems in the work place, which is where your personal life stays out of the equation!

      As one of our classmates stated, and I must say that I agree with him, “honesty is an important virtue”. Some professionals have tendencies to leave part of the truth out, also known as fibbing, or just plain old lying! That doesn’t seem very honest to me, how about you?  Not only patients, but usually everyone wants to know all the facts when a particular subject involves them. When a possible potential problem occurs by a professional, but they don’t want to take the responsibility or want anything to do with the occurrence except look for an outlet to pass the troubles.  I’m not saying that mishaps never occur, but what happened to the good old days when people would admit when they were wrong, and not look to pass the blame to another source.  Ethical decision-making is not the problem; the problem becomes who has first-class quality ethics and who doesn’t. I do believe that we as future administrators hold the key to success, and can overlay the road to an enhanced generation.   Like we have always heard before “it’s easier said then done”, but we are the ones who can do it.

      How often do we take everyday life for granted?  You wake up in the morning  and everything happens for a reason.  The electric light goes on when you touch the switch, the  pot stops boiling when the coffee is down, the elevator comes to your floor when you hit the button, the automatic door at work swings open as you approach, the computer comes to life with the turn of a switch….all things just happen as an everyday occurrence. Do you ever stop to think how all that came about. Do you appreciate the fact that someone’s ingenuity and determination brought many inventions about  that we all take for granted.  So many things in live go unappreciated, even life itself. Do you ever stop and think about how lucky you may be?               I recently interviewed a Vietnam veteran who was injured severely during the war. He stepped  on a mine and lost three of his four limbs. He remembers the moment that happened.   So many other veterans  faced similar circumstances, but many had chosen a simple way out. They committed  suicide.  I asked him if he had thought about suicide as well.  His   response was, “why take the easy way out”. He also said that he appreciates life more than ever before.              After meeting that veteran, I must say that we who take our  everyday life for granted are extremely fortunate.    For those who are handicap, or disabled in a way that challenges them to perform in the “ordinary world,”  probably   appreciate  their lifestyle. So many disabled people manage to work and strive for excellence and not take the easy way out. I have to admire them all.   I often think about that   Vietnam veteran  who works for a real-estate company. He  goes to work every day,  driving himself, and has made  something happen in his life. A lot of us may call it a miracle; he calls it determination, hard work, and lastly appreciation for everyday of life.

          How difficult is it to find good help in today’s society?  Recently, I was listening to my neighbor complain about his crew. He owns a remodeling company and has not been able to work for the last few weeks because of surgery. He complained how nothing is getting done since he has not been able to supervise various job sites. Is this a realistic situation for most bosses? I said, " why don’t you hire a new crew."  His response was, “it’s just to hard to find good help nowadays”.      That employer raises a good point; do individuals enter their jobs based on the good reason that they want to do work, or do they just want to make money? As supervisors, we need to ask ourselves, must we always be present to make sure a job is getting done?  Obviously, being present all the time is not possible.       I believe that laziness is prevalent throughout the workforce, and it is only becoming worse. Negative energy, just all around negative energy, is contagious and needs to be eliminated from the work environment.  On the other hand a good attitude, positive energy, and motivation are examples that we as administrators should possess and display.   Remember, a good attitude, positive energy and motivation can be contagious and bring about surprisingly good benefits to all.

       You often hear about  "the good old days"  when you would say hello and you would receive a positive response;  when you would hold the door open for someone and he or she would say "thank you"; when drivers were polite and road rage did not exist. I ordered some food at a drive-through today and said hello to the worker at the window. The reply I received was an abrupt “what do you want?”        Friendly to say the least, but how has the public changed. Supposedly,  you are a product of your surroundings. If that's so, when you are depressed, annoyed, unhappy, and just plain miserable, how might that affect your attitude in your professional life?     When on goes to the doctor’s office and hopes to be confronted with comfort, warmth or even to feel a since of well being, imagine what the attitude would be if   the doctor only cares about the co-pay or the amount of patients that are being seen.  We know not everyone reacts in such a manner, but I often wonder why so many people have a poor attitude everyday.       What I am saying is that we need to set the precedent for future generations, not only for those entering the healthcare professions.   It seems that everything is taken for granted, and too many people do not enjoy the simple pleasures of life anymore. For those of us who are health care students, we have an obligation. We entered the field to help those in need, and or to make sure that those servicing the needy are doing it correctly. Hopefully, healthcare students are not studying for the wrong reasons, and if they are, we have an obligation to correct them.

      Morals. What does this would mean to you anymore? Is everything set in stone for individuals to follow in another’s path? I will never forget what my dad said to me years ago in regards to a statement I made which was "pops I want to do exactly what you do". He said, ‘Jon I am honored that you feel that way, but you will want to made your own decisions and face your own consequences". I know exactly what he meant! For example, I want to be the administrator for a healthcare organization after I graduate. While taking this challenge, I will face many difficult decisions involving almost every aspect of healthcare. I am a person who will go to work every day for the passion and gratitude of doing my best to save, and make lives reach the fullest quality of health that I can. So many organizations nowadays are so dedicated to see that someone who is receiving care makes it out of the hospital by there deadline regardless of the fact if they are ready or not. Bonus, that whole subject titled "freebies and kickback" have consumed healthcare employees to not see the vision of healthcare. Healthcare means protect the patient, not protect the budget. Life is what you make of it, life is good!

      We as American Citizens have the ultimate privilege to complete or do anything we want. No one is told they can not go to school, or drive across America just because someone woke up one day and said, “I feel like driving across country today.” Classes that are taken on line can be completed at the individuals own pace, and at any time of the day that he or she chooses. We have the right to bear arms, freedom of speech, without armed forces standing outside of your home ready for a war. We as Americans are extremely fortunate to do what ever we want to, but the unfortunate side is that certain individuals may take advantage of the system and abuse it. It may be allowed for an employer to call an employee a jerk, but is it ethical? I believe that we are the most fortunate people in the world, and we as Americans should embrace each and every day without taking advantage of it.

      Everyday we are encountered by many different questions that sometimes may be difficult to answer. When someone ask you a question, do you know the answer before it is time to reply? Too many individuals today are close-minded; therefore making decisions that are one sided. What I am trying to say is that we need to travel roads that have different streets to reach our destination. Professionals tend to look at what caused the problem, but fail to look at different solutions to avoid the incidence from occurring again. Ethical decision-making relies on the power of an individual to see different avenues to conquer problems that may arise. Being wise, making appropriate decisions, and confidence are the elements of success to provide excellent answers to the questions that an organization may stumble upon.
