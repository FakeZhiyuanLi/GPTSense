      I'm such a twat. Well, at times anyway... I've started coming out of my shell a little bit over the last couple of days. Hee, it's strange actually, 'cos I've just read back through my little collection of blogs and if you don't know the situation I'm coming from, they make no sense at all! I'll explain soon enough, that is if you're really interested to stay tuned. We'll see... Anyway, moving swiftly and effortlessly back to my original thoughts... I had a great chat with one of the people I thought I had an issue with (my over active imagination working again, and there wasn't really an issue. Amazing how all those feelings and thoughts can suddenly just go. I now feel bad for feeling them. I wished I could explain to people how my thought processes work. I think half of the problem is that I spend way too much time on my own. I like being on my own a lot of the time, but it does give me time to think, and to fester and to deliberate on my own insecuriorities. There's still issues to discuss, this chap (I'm never going to name names on this) wants me and the other people involved to all go for a drink to put some issues to bed. I'm well up for it, however I'm not sure that the others will be... It will be my last opportunity to sort things out once and for all... only time will tell if it's possible or not. I hope it is as I don't want to live my life for the next few years harbouring anger and bitterness towards this guy.  But needless to say, he'll be too busy, something will come up, "sorry dude" etc and it will be put off, or he'll have to go early when the conversation starts moving in a way he doesn't like. Friendships should be real, you should be able to handle the hard times and the good, and by the hard times I mean be able to handle the arguments and disagreements. That's what love breaks through, thats what sincerity can overcome... we shall see if the traits I thought this guy has actually exist, or he has been taking the piss out of my for the last two years...

      I am drunk. Again. I'm such a contradiction. On the one hand I claim to be a Christian. On the other hand, I really like a drink, plus I smoke, plus I hate everyone I live with at the moment. I hate having all these feelings of anger and bitterness, then having to try and read my Bible, think back to what I believe and then try to love the people I want to hate... Man, it's hard. All I want to do is go downstairs and kick off, shout and scream, start a fight, have an argument and really tell people exactly what I think of them right now. However I can't. I bloody hate all this teaching of loving the people you don't feel like loving. The hardest part of it all, is purely the fact that it would be easy to love someone if you could just say "I'm sorry, I fucked up" and they go... "Ahhhh, ok, I love you too, I'm sorry aswell and I forgive you". But if I was to go downstairs and say that now, I'm sure I would be greeted with an uncomfortable silence and no reaction. So it's hard to take the first step... It's frustrating that the Bible asks me to love unconditionally and I don't wamt to. It's even more annoying that by me going downstairs and saying sorry for being out of order and the people whom I have the issue with maybe not saying anything and them still harbour a grudge, in accordance to the Bible, I would be in the right and they would be in the wrong. I have to do it unconditionally... All I want in the world at the moment is to go downstairs, say sorry and for us all to have a hug and it all to be forgotten about. But I know that if I did go down and say sorry, it would just make me feel more angry and upset. What do I do now? Eh? I will just end up feeling more guilty and upset by trying to do the right thing. Why is it so much harder to try and do the right thing? If anyone has any bright ideas, I'd be more than pleased to hear them... Rx.

      Are a fantastic band. One of the things that really excites me musically is when you can't explain how things happen. If anyone ever does end up reading this, then I'll try to explain. It's the "zone" - the place that you hit but don't realise how you got there. It's only happened to me a few times. It's when you're on stage, you're playing physically but emotionally you're on a different level, in a different zone. When you can shut your eyes, be in a different place, away from the feelings and frustrations of the real world. For a few brief, fleeting seconds, you can be in another place... If you want a visual example, go and watch the U2 Go Home DVD from Slane Castle and play Where the streets have no name, at the very end, Edge has his eyes shut, playing the end riff... you can tell by the expression on his face that he is in the zone... music can be heavenly, refreshing, beautiful and honest... it can also destroy, intimidate, upset and anger... it's a powerful thing and should be respected, admired and treated as a gift. Whether you can play or not, are a participator or a creator, are good or are shabby... it's an amazing thing and I feel privalidged and burdoned all at the same time.   Current fave listening - confessions of a dying atheist - Muse.   "It's scares the hell out of me"

      I'm not a confrontational type of bloke. Pretty much exactly the opposite I'd say. But, I still can't keep myself from wanting arguments to happen. If I've pissed someone off, why can't they come to me and just say so? It might just be my way of solving issues.  I wished I had the intelligence to sort things out in an adult way and sit down and chat about it. But when you're passionate about something, I find it so hard just to sit down and go "ahh, ok... yes, I understand" I'd rather just shout and scream and cry and argue and be passionate! Others don't like that attitude and when I'm calm and relaxed, I can understand that... But I wouldn't mind someone just coming to me and saying "Bastard!!" because at least that's a reaction!!  I care about others and I thought they cared about me... but at times, it's like I don't exist. That hurts. I'm going to start pretending they don't exist and see how they like it. The main problem is I can't... the reason I hurt so much is the fact I want to sort this out... but as supposed adults, we can't. I want to be retaliatory and full of vengence (great word, not used enough - see pulp fiction if you haven't already!) but I just can't, so I'm full of conflicting feelings which I don't understand... If God's in control, I haven't seen Him around for a while... if you see Him by any chance, tell Him I wouldn't mind a word...

      Well, here we go then. I'm still not too sure why I'm doing this. I think it's a combination of lots of things. Certainly one factor is the fact that I feel I'm definately at a cross roads in my life at the moment.  I'm hoping that by being able to write down my thoughts and feelings as and when they occur, I will be able to help control my feelings of anger and resentment. By being able to look back upon the things that are happening now in my life I think it will help my emotional development in the future. It will help me deal with things in the future which have caused me so much pain in the "now".  It feels odd to me in some way that I've decided to start writing this at what I feel to be at the end of my recent emotional turmoil. I have so much anger towards people at the moment, not the nasty physical stuff, just feelings of hurt and resentment. By writing on here, I hope I will be able to express myself in ways I've recently found so hard.   At this exact moment in time, which is 10.17am on Sunday morning, I am sat on the end of my bed with my laptop, typing. I'm still in the half asleep half awake state of mind. I'm sure you know what I mean. That half dressed, day has started but I'm still pretending it hasn't type feeling? I've got a slight hangover (although it was worth it) and I've got no ciggarettes, so I'm off out to shop to get some.  I'll be back soon I'm sure. Oh, if you ever do stumble across this, drop a line and say hi. Rx
