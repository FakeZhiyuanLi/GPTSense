      Well being that I have been at Oxford University now.. for about a week.. I though it was high time that I purchased some apparell - so after a weeks worth of window shopping and bargain hunting I found the cheapest deal on apparell that says Oxford. I purchased a white t-shirt and grayish sweatshirt with Oxford University in navy screen printed on them.   It was a rather chilly day today, so I figured it was the perfect time to show off my new digs. Little did I know that by doing this I would be named animal torturer and animal killer!!&nbsp; yes, you heard right!!&nbsp; Here's the story...  We walked down to the Bodleian Library today so that Tony could do a bit of researching about Oberlin's ties to Oxford way back when or whatever else in the world he wanted to keep his nose in while he was here??&nbsp; However, we come to find out that the library was closed today because there was going to be some type of demonstration going on, and the university was fearful that something might go wrong... Well.. it was getting to be lunch time so we decided to head into a pub called the Kings Arms for some fish and chips (a couple of days ago we heard they had the best fish and chips around). On our way to the pub.. which was only about a 2 min. walk from the library.. we see 2 HUGEEE&nbsp; trailers w/ Police Horses.. or something of that sort written on them. HMM.. so like most humans it got our curiosity running.. so after the wonderful lunch of fish and chips, which cost $20.00!!&nbsp; no long john silvers here!! we decide to walk around the city centre to see what kind of demonstration is going on, plus he needed to exchange some money and buy some postcards too.  Well.. wouldn't it just be my luck that hugely written on a large sign that many of people are carrying Down to the University of Oxford's Experimental Laboratories.&nbsp; Apparently, they do experiments on animals!!&nbsp; So Not understanding why in the world these people are giving me very very very mean looks.. I kind of walk past to get to the store and here nams such as animal killer, animal torturer..&nbsp; and guess who they were talking about!!&nbsp; muahhh.. mi..&nbsp; now.. I could've gotten offended, but then again.. i was wearing the&nbsp; sweatshirt, not to mention I am a carnivore, not to mention that I did kill and pluck, gut and cook a chicken b4 I left, .. so I figured whatever.. maybe I am maybe i'm not!!&nbsp; But when I got back to my room.. you best believe I switched my sweatshirt!!&nbsp; JUST IN CASE!!

      Well.. yesterday was our free afternoon. In the morning "the ladies & gent" which we have named the guest crew because all of us are ladies and only one man&nbsp;traveled to the Botanic Gardens.. hmm.. don't remember if I have written this or not??  Botanic Gardens - not to be confused with Botanical Gardens!! - we got scolded from the locals for calling it this. Well.. Mom, Grandma, Jackie, and Robbie would've been in heaven here - me on the other hand found it a bit dull. It was very neat though to learn about some of it. Most of the stuff wasn't blooming and there was a lot of greenage which I don't care to much of, but there was tons and tons of plants.  They started to gardens here very much like everything in Oxford with the purpose of learning, so primarily at the beginning there were only medicinal plants here and a few other rarities. They had some sort of piney looking shrub Ephedra something or other which has a chemical that is used in inhalers for those who have asthma. They also had a plant that was extremely posionus called "dealy night" I guess that some type of extract use to be used in eye surgeries.  They also had a huge section which contains edibles.. with fruits, vegetables, nuts and herbs and spice plants. Their apples however didn't look to tasty, but there salad greens looked wonderful!!  We then ventured into their "glass houses" instead of green houses. They were both a bit tropical - they grew banana plants (one of which was sprouting bananas - in case you didn't know bananas grou up from the tree not down), their was also a huge habenero plant (the peppers were ripe for the picking and he offered us a few if we would've liked.. I wasn't stupid enough to want to pick them w/o gloves - one of the ladies did however, and paid for it later when she rubbed her eye!&nbsp; OUCH) Their most interesting plant, for me, was their Victorian Lilies. These lilly pads were GIGANTIC!! They were round and had short walls that came up. They tour guide said that about 4 or 5 years ago one of the gardeners there was pregnant and about 6 months after she had the baby she waded into the pond area and laid the child on one of the lilly pads because it was rumored that they could hold afloat a small child. It worked, so the Gardens apparently gained much press over this huge things!! They also had a rock garden which was okay, and upon entrance you walked through their rose garden which was pretty.  Since we had the evening free must of us did our on little adventures. We found a small pup The Wheatshef and listened to a bit of jazz. Then we made our way back aroun 8ish because we were hungry. Although because everything closes so freaking early here.. must of the pubs and restaurants had closed their kitchen for the evening. After about an hour or so of walking around getting turned down by at least 8 different places we found an Indian cuisine restaurant - not what either of us were looking for at that time of night. I wasn't to hungry, so I tried to order a simple appetizer and small side of rice however, the stinking place had a&nbsp;Â£8 minnimum to order (which is approximately $17) so I had to order a man dish. I ordered some type of lamb dish which turned out to be terrific.. It has been the first time that I have tasted much seasoning in any of the food here. However, it was a tad spicey (not that I mind) but I sure felt it this morning&nbsp; when I did my mourning routine!!&nbsp; FEW...&nbsp; don't think I'll be eating any Indian food anytime soon!  Well.. I am very tired from walking around and playing cards till late in the nights so I will leave you at that so I may take my nap.

      The Pubs - I no longer will complain about the clubs in the states closing at 2 am. The Pubs here close at 11pm.. I guess it is a way to deteor their students the smart assess as they are, not to drink themselves into a tizzy!!&nbsp;  An experience to remember - A group of us were told to take it down an octave, in a Pub that is, can you imagine being in a bar in Cleveland and one of the bartenders telling you that you are being to loud!! We all had a good laugh about that one!!&nbsp; I feel like such a rebel here because we have been kicked out of the Pubs everynight!!!...  No... no .. no.. we were not getting rowdy with the locals, it was just closing time!!&nbsp;&nbsp; until this afternoon... the Botanical Gardens, then Blenheim Palace!!  Hope all is going well back in Ohio!!&nbsp; Or CA, for those of us lucky enough to be there.

                          This morning's tour was that of the Ashmolean Musuem, Beaumont Street, Oxford OX1 2PH: Admission was free (thank god because everything is just so "bloody" expensive over here)  urlLink http://www.ashmol.ox.ac.uk/  &nbsp;  The Musuem is rather large!!&nbsp; To say the least with four floors and and close to 60 different types of exhibits. The musuem was started ..umm&nbsp; I don't quite remember right now the dates ..oops.. guess I should've been paying closer attention..Well anyways.. I do remember that it is Britains oldest public musuem. It was started by some man named Tradescant, which actually was started after his son journied to America and brought back several things. From then on.. many of his friends would give him collectible items and his son many other journeys and brought back many other things. The items were passed down from generation to generation throught the Tradescant family, however come the third generation the young boy Tradescant, passed at the early age of 14 or 15 which left only a daughter - of course not thinking that a woman could handle such responsibility as of keeping the tradition and items in preservation he gave his collection to a man named Ashmole...&nbsp; TBC&nbsp; luch time   So to continue..&nbsp; Ashmole preserved and continued on the tradition of collection rarities from around the world. Later there was a building created by Asmole because the collection was outgrowing his house, and a second building was then made after the collection outgrew the first one.  Some of the collections are quit similiar to those that you would see in musuems back home, but the jewlery collection was absolutely amazing!!&nbsp; And for all those of you who truly know me... understand that it would have to be absolutely magnificent for me to say something like this. I also found the Egypt section quit interesting. Any of you every think that the "soul" of these entombed individulas that have been unearthed by archealogist (sp?) get ripped away from their life after death because of not having their body?? I wonder if you could go back into time and ask ancient Egyptians what they thought would happen to an individual if they were unearthed hundreds of years from their death?&nbsp; Would they say that because they have spent so much time in the afterlife they would no longer need their body, organs, and other worldly possessions to continue their life their after??&nbsp; Is this the cause of poor in the world??&nbsp; The untombing of ancient people who were ripped away from their after life w/ no worldly possessions.. to mearly roam the earth of today with nothing?? hmmm...&nbsp; guess all this fresh air is getting to me!!  Anywayss.. enough with all of that..&nbsp; This afternoon I ventured over to the Natural History Musuem  urlLink http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/homepage.htm &nbsp;and Pitt Rivers Musuem  urlLink http://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/ . The Natural History Musuems is pretty much identical to those found back in the states. However their is a neat little section about Alice (from Alice in Wonderland) and a really cool replica of the Dodo bird!!  The Pitts River Musuem was formed by a man named Pitts who was interested in how tools were invented and then improved through the years in many cultures. It has been the most interesting section of my ventures so far. He had collected many things from many different countries that all were used for the same purposes, but created totally different... Examples:&nbsp; yarns and different types of materials used by different people from all over, types of beginning canoes and boats and how they transformed over time, examples of how death has been preserved and changed over time (I particularly found fascinating the exhibits on shrunken heads, most of which came from some part of Ecuador. They look so real) there was also many examples of clothing and footwear, cooking utensils, and musical instruments from the beginning to the transformation of what they appear to look now. I think I might venture back over there tomorrow afternoon since it will be a free afternoon.  Well.. the food here is VERY BLAND. Thank god that the cafeteria here has spices set out to flavor the food with. So far I have mostly eaten fish, I have had salmon three times and everytime it has been terrific.. oops I lied they had raw smoked salmon last night for a appetizzer (the texture almost made me lose it!!&nbsp; but the taste was great) I tried some sort of chicken today with couscous (sp?) I thought it was a B-B-Que chicken, but came to find out it was mearly in sweetened tomato juice, so I added many spices and it turned out wonderful.  Well.. I am off to go for a walk to grab an ice-cream cone! The Ice-cream in other parts of the world is the BEST!!

          cherrio all  &nbsp;  I made it to merry ole' england in one piece!! we arrived here early sunday morning into Heathrow airport, took a bus into Gloucester and then we took a taxi into Oxford.  &nbsp;  Did you know that Oxford  urlLink http://www.ox.ac.uk/ &nbsp;is really a compilation of 39 small colleges put together. Apparently their is no rhyme nor reason as to how you get into a certain college. Unless of course your parents were fortunate enough to attend one of them you would have preference to that certain college.  &nbsp;  Did you know that a lot of the film Harry Potter was filmed right here at Oxford??&nbsp; I got to go visit the entrance way in which Professor McGonagal meets the students before they enter Hogwarts the first day of school.  urlLink http://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/visitor/index.html &nbsp;I also got to see the Great Hall in which they dined. Although they made a repllica of this hall because the real one only has three long tables and Hogwarts had four schools. One of the libraries here in Oxford also was used as the library and hospital at Hogwarts. I will try to venture over to the New College (which isn't at all new) where the majority of the filming was done. I really wish I had a digital camera right now so I could down load the pics :-(&nbsp; I will however try to update this ASAP upon my arrival back home.  &nbsp;  Did you know that Alice from Alice in Wonderland  urlLink http://www.aliceinoxford.net/ &nbsp;was an actual little girl??&nbsp; The writer of the book actually studied and taught Math here at Oxford, however he spent&nbsp; a lot of his free time telling stories to the young children of the heads of the colleges here.  &nbsp;  Well.. I will be on my way to dinner and will try to update this daily of my journeys!!&nbsp;  tomorrow the museums!  &nbsp;

      Hello all... I know it has been quite some times since I have updated this, but as I am sure most of you know that I do get extremely busy around the school year.  So quick update: I put in my letter of resignation to Oberlin the beginning of July, and signed a contracted for Vermilion the same time. I will be teaching Highschool in Vermilion - my schedule will be a "unit" or self-contained Freshman English first block, second block will be inclusion either Sophmore or Senior English, third block will be inclusion either Sophmore or Senior English, and fourth block is my planning period. For those of you who look at this and say 4 periods!!  Vermilion is on block scheduling which means that their are only 4 "periods" or blocks in the day - each block is 90 minutes in length!!  YUP... a long time for a highschool kid to sit still!! I also got hired in as the Boys JV Golf Coach!!!  We had tryouts the week of August 9th, and our first match was Monday, August 16th!  We took 4th place out of 14 teams, our team medalist shot a 90, and we played at Bucyrus Country Club......   If you don't know where it is or never heard of it... picture corn fields and corn fields and more corn fields.. that's about all we saw on our drive down!!  On Thursday we will play at Fox Creek for the Admiral King Invitational.  Puppy updates:  Shadow is doing wonderfull he weighs 40 lbs. now. I will be taking him into the Vet next month to get him neutered (It's kind of a shame because he would make some beautiful puppies!!  His hair is no longer the big puffy furball that it was - it is actually turning out to look golden retrieverish. Oh well... no matter what he is he is a great dog. He knows and obeys the commands come, sit, drop it, stay, and sometimes lay!!  He loves to play fetch, as long as you don't throw it to far!, and he is currently trying to learn how to catch stuff in the air. The cats are not afraid of him - he is actually afraid of Ray (the black one that I'm sure no one has seen), and Polo smacks him around all the time.  House updates:  Really things are still the same.. I have put primer on my kitchen cabinets under the sink area, the walls that I could get too, so I'm just waiting for someone to show me how to mud and tape the holes and drywall correctly so I can get the paint up. Other than that everything really is the same.  Well.. AS usually my time is running short, so I will try to catch up again next week with more news from me! LOVE YA'LL
